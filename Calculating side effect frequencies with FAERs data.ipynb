If I go to work after skipping a dose, I have to have someone bring it to me, so that I won't get disoriented and anxious. I don't like that aspect of this drug at all.

      "After trying several antidepressants and lithium, the doctor prescribed lamotrigine/lamictal and wellbutrin/bupropion which has helped alot. lithium didn't help at all and caused rapid weight gain once i reached 1000mg (theraptutic level)and thyroid problems and was still depressed even depite trying celexa, citopram, and wellbutrin combined with the lithium. discouraged, i went in and asked to be taken off my drugs and she said to try this before making such a hasty decision and it worked! lamictal took away my anger/aggression and depression slightly so she prescribed wellbutrin to help with the depression and it was a life changer! it takes a while to reach a theraputic level (over a month) but with each week, i felt better. what people have to remember is that each drug effects different neurotransmitters in your brain and each person is different. plus, people are more likely to review when they're disatisfied, rather than happy so that also screws witht he rating. I say try it and see if it helps! I take mine before i want to go to sleep and you do get drowsy but when i wake up that doesn't effect me as much. wellbutrin is also a stimulant so that may be another factor. start with a low dose (25mg) and increase weekly by 25 mg to lessen the chance of getting the rash which is rare. before this drug, i wanted to kill myself and was very angry and depressed despite being on lithium which most bipolar people find effective; just not me. each person is different. be willing to try different drugs or combinations and be patient because there is a theraptuic level you have to reach. \n",

Couldnt figure out if it was the med or just me, so called pdoc and she said STOP! Been off about a week and started seroquel in the mean time. Noticed a difference in just 2 days off limictal so must have been the med. Starting new med today, hope it goes well!

Once I gave in I went to my GP & tried anti-depressants, they made me distant and angry. I gave them a moment to see if I'd adjust, I didn't and I left them alone. I moved to Lamictal/Lamotrigine as per my Pdoc. As I moved up in dosage I began to notice that I no longer had issues w/getting out of bed or feeling suicidal. I no longer felt the need or want to drink, I could sit in bars w/my buddies and be happy w/out having a round or two or five! I no longer looked for sex everywhere I could find it. No more spending cash on god-knows-what for NO REASON at all. Side effects: insomnia, headaches, sometimes feeling a little distant, strange/vivid dreams...but TRUST me I'm MILES from where I used to be and that's alright w/me! \n",

      "I have been taking the generic form of lamotrigine for 5+ years. Unlike some others, it has worked well in controlling my symptoms. I feel balanced. I experienced multiple major depressive events starting in my 30's which I treated by indulging in alcohol. Eventually I tried every SSRI on the market, Wellbutrin, Trazadone and several others. These made me manic and caused severe insomina. After taking lamotrigine for a couple or years, I began having panic attacks. My doctor added Xanax. It was the perfect combination and the most effective treatment to date. One thing is important - don't use drugs or alcohol if you expect to get the full benefits of this product. I haven't had a drink for 3+ years and this was the key to achieving maximum effectiveness. Substance abuse is a problem with many of us with bipolar depression. If that is a factor, you have to deal with that as part of the treatment plan. Not always easy to do, but worth it. I was teetering between a good life and losing it all. I didn't lose my life. Identifying the right combination of drugs and a good psychiatrist is key to finding the right thing for you. I take 300 mg per day - 150 mg morning and night with 50 mg Xanax at the same time. No side effects. \n",

      "WARNING: THIS MEDICINE CAUSES SEVERE INSOMNIA!  I started this medicine 4 years ago and have suffered insomnia ever since. I was prescribed to take it at night. 3 years ago the insomnia became worse- lasting up to 4-5 days at a time.  I NEVER SHUT DOWN - not even the following day.  I tried everything on the market: behavioral modification (dark room, etc), all the drugs listed on this website for insomnia. Finally, after forgetting to take it for a couple of nights, I was able to sleep normally.  I tried, as a last resort, to take it in the morning only - AND TO MY RELIEF AND ELATION MY INSOMNIA WAS CURED! I take the medicine first thing in the morning now and it gives me a the same buzz as taking vitamin B.  I am tired at night like I am supposed to be and sleep like a baby.  I actually dream now whereas before I laid awake all night listening to every sound.  Apparantly, because this side effect is so rare - no doctor I saw could identify the cause of my insomnia.  I write this for those of you out who suffered like me with insomnia for years with no relief.  \n",

I started on the sample kit prescribed to me from my psychiatrist. 13 days into beginning the starter kit my Lymph nodes began to swell. I got a red itchy rash all over my body. I didnt begin to think this was a serious problem until my fever reached 105 degress F. I was taken into ER and the red rash was all over my body. The pain in my lymph nodes was so bad that i was precribed darvocet for the pain. The symptoms died down after a week. The ER stated I had a strepp infection and was given an amoxocilin antibiotic. After completing the antibiotic I was told by my Psych to begin taking the Lamictal at day 14 were I left off. I took the Lamictal at 830 in the morning by 10 am I was taken to the ER for an alergic reaction. I am partial to all medications for I can help people however, This particular medication almost landed me in my death bed...\r\n",

Caused me to pace, couldn't sit still it lie down. It was fidgety leg syndrome, (sounds minor, but it's not when its not ESP when it is occurring frequently). She put me on cogentine for the side effects.  I don't have fidgety legs anymore.  I've had a terrible dry mouth that makes it very difficult to talk, or swallow.  My legs tighten up with my feet in a curled up position, very tightly, while lieing down.  While standing, my calves are very still tight and my big toe on my left foot stats extended upward and all other toes in a cramped position.  It is almost constant, as much as I try to relax or stretch it doesn't go away.  I've told my dr of this many times and she continues to lower my dose of Lamictal and its 'side effect cure\" cogetin.  Still there, but very much improved.

      "I have only been on Lamictal for 4 days now. I'm also on Cymbalta 60mgs, Xanax .5mgs at night to help my mind stop racing so I can sleep, and Adderall 20mgs 2x a day. Also prescribed Trazadone if I feel like I need it but I hate taking it. Anyway, back to Lamictal, my psych instructed me to take 25mgs 1x daily for 2 weeks. This is day 4 and it seems like it is making me more depressed and just really irritated and blah feeling especially in the late afternoon/evenings. I have been on all of these other medications in the past and never had an issue with any of them. Lamictal is the only new thing added to that cocktail. After the 2 weeks are up, I go to 50mgs a day. I just feel kinda apathetic, annoyed, and very low energy at night and I take it in the mornings with my Cymbalta and Adderall. I need to call my psych Monday to ask if I should push through these first 2 weeks or what... Anyway, that's my experience so far. Hope it changes. I used to be on Abilify for bipolar and never had any problems with it... Maybe he'll switch me back but from what I understand, that's a completely different category of drug. Any input anyone??? \n",

      "I have been on every medication possible for depression since I was 12 years old. In December 2010 I attempted suicide and was placed in an intensive outpatient treatment program. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and Anxiety Disorder and was put on Lamictal and Xanax (.50 mg). My therapeutic level for the Lamictal was/is 150mg (200mg caused difficulties sleeping). The Lamictal helped with the depression and \"dark thoughts\". I was on the meds from December 2010 - March 2012 and got cocky and decided I was cured and didn't need the meds anymore (not realizing the truth the meds were doing what they were suppose to do).  At first I was fine but by November 2013 things began spinning out of control with my depression and hypo mania. In May 2014 I was so distraught and spiraled down again that I left work went home and cut myself 17 times. Once again I was back in intensive outpatient treatment but for longer this time. I was put back on the Lamictal the end of May 2014 and once again the \"dark thoughts\" have subsided and I am feeling stronger again (and have managed to deal with four deaths of friends the past three weeks and though my emotions were grief and pain which are expected, the out of control bleakness has not occurred). I have had to come to terms that I will always require med management for my disorder and can not go off my meds again as my \"experiment\" of being fine without them was a complete failure. I am not saying everyone will experience the same results and obviously by the mixed reviews many have not. All I know is after 36 years of medication experimentation Lamictal has proven to be the one which was by far the most effective for me!  (FYI - I experienced no side effects other than sleep difficulties at 200 mg and so it was readjusted back to 150 mg which has proven the best level for me.) \n",

After visits with 5 different doctors, including being sent home by an ER doctor, they finally decided her skin rash was Steven Johnsons/TENS and flew her to a burn center.  She lost over 100% of her skin, spent weeks on a ventilator, has had multiple surgeries, including skin grafting, and experiences severe and constant pain. She was young and strong and will be fortunate enough to escape this experience with only extensive scaring, dry eyes, and hypersensitivity to cold and heat.

I only took a shower every 10-14 days. Basically until I couldn't stand myself any longer and got afraid of being in trouble at my part time job. I finally talked to my doctor about all of this and she put me on lamictal. After four weeks I was on 100mg per day. The difference is night and day. I eat well, take care of myself, and no longer have to worry about my cleanliness. Sometimes I still struggle with the energy to do things I need to do, but for the most part am doing very well. I am taking the lamictal in addition to all the meds listed ate the beginning, even my friend says I am more perky and have a more positive outlook on things instead of being so negative all the time.

My doctor put me on 25 mg of Lamictal, and I felt different immediately.  I felt more centered, patient, calmer and mellow.  My employees and husband also noticed the difference in my mood. I went up to 50 mg and, eventually, to 75 mg, my current dose.  I am on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, Wellbutrin SR 100 mg and Lamictal 75 mg.  this combination has changed my life.  I think and communicate more intelligently, and I am more level-headed.  It hasn't changed my personality.  It just stabilized my mood swings.

      "Hi, my 16-year-old son just started Lamictal on 7/6/2013 for mood disorder. He started on 25mg and now 75mg and will start 100mg on the 16th.  He's basically very depressed.  He was on Effexor and Seroquel (400mg XR) for some time but developed some breast tissue on the nipple area.  So he stopped Seroquel and started Lamictal as mood stabilizer. After stopping Seroquel, the breast tissues are still there.  The Psychiatrit said there is no the same side effect on boy growing breasts for Lamictal.  However, from some web sites, I saw a lot of women talking about their breasts were signigicantly enlarged for a couple of cups. I also read 2 posts saying one 13-year-old boy and a middle-aged man discribing they have gynecomastia.  Could anyone shed light on this problem?  Is there any document indicating this is a side effect?  Do you have any experience with it?  Seroquel can increase the prolactin level.  I am not sure if Lamictal has the same side effect but works in a different way (estrogen, etc.).  I did read that Effexor has the same side effect but very rare. I only hope my son's problem is not getting worse with the treatment.\r\n",

I fought dx because of no manic (whoo hoo, happy) moods, then was told it was due to my anger & the depression was so deep it was very hard to come out of. I was put on Adderall with no side effects. It does get me out of bed in the am. My husband calls Lamictal the miracle drug. That's because he was on the receiving end of my anger rants & they were really bad! I was doing great with my medication for a while, but I can't afford therapy & it is a daily struggle to keep myself motivated. I do get unscheduled motivation, what I call \"A bug up my ...\" & I go until I can't, but they are far & few in between. I think I need an increase in my Lamictal.

      "Diagnosed as Bipolar I. Taking Lamictal for about 6 months. Was taking Cymbalta before that. Lamictal is the better of the two. The side effects certainly occur but I consider them annoying, nothing more. I listed them in case you may think your side effects are unusual. Side effects (for me) include: Have experienced a slight back-of-the tongue swelling. Can't climb a ladder. Very emtional eg cry at the drop of a hat. Have to sleep every few hours. Vomitting during a meal every couple of weeks or days. Extreme laziness is almost constant. Summary: Love this drug. My actions were unpredictable before taking Lamictal. \n",

      "I was on Prozac for 25 years until I reached menopause and became extremely suicidal. The doctors added Lamictal and Seroquel. The Seroquel was horrid! Had an unsatiable appetite and gained over 30 pounds in a short time. We discontinued the Seroquel, and now just on the Lamictal. The appetite is back to normal but still struggling to lose wieght. I feel more stable now than I have in years. I don't know if the Lamictal is an adherent to my weight loss efforts. Sometimes I get an eerie/dizzy type feeling but it passes quickly. My memory seems to have dulled somewhat and I can't always find the right word I am looking for, but other than that, I think this drugs benefits have outweighed the perceived side effects. I sleep better and can get up in the mornings now so much easier. I wish someone knew the long term effects of this drug. I hate taking meds, but I guess this one is a winner cause I don't feel like running or committing suicide any more. My family is sure happier with me.\r\n",

( the new psychiatrist was going to put me on ENSAM patch while taking cymbalta..= seratonin syndrone..Original psychiatrist knew about that too. ALSO she told me that taking Depakote and Lamictal = TOXIC..I am on 500mg Depakote bedtime, 125mg Depakote am. SO for now she is weaning me off the lamictal..Originall Shrink had me on ZOLOFT. It worked + .50mg Ativan..1mg Klonipin..I was fine, stable, able to handle things in calm manner, shower, drive, etc..I had not a wisper of anxiety since 2007 to March 2010. Shrink bullied me into takng Prozac..I can' take Proazac- get adverse reaction--head goes spinning out of control at 15mg. SHRINK said lower it to 10mg and BAM hit with dreadful ANXIETY. Then Zoloft gave me ANXIETY after swithced.THen another new shrink - puts me on 5-6mg Ativan/day. DX: Severe anxiety. Finally went back to origina shrink and was put on CYMBALTA..It finally greatly reduced anxiety,stil had to take about 3mg throught out day..So I have been screwed up since May 2010. Not stable at all. I REFUSED the Prozac BUT before I coud get out the most imp. info. SHRINK ambused me, Prozac,etc,etc ..I never got to tell her I took it before and I pill made my head go crazy..due to the immediate ambush. SO I have been in hell for 1year,3months. I don't trust SHRINKS anymore. I don't know what is to become of me. For those of you who have had sucess on Lamictal, I'm happy for you..Very worrid (understatement) about me. YOu don't  know what it is like to feel normal & functioal on a medication, then have your shrink bully you into med (Prozac) that has caused me to have prmanent anxiety BEAUSE shrink ambushed me before I could say: I got adverse reaction from Prozac before.  \n",

The only side effect that I've had is extreme sleepiness, but only when I'm sitting still. When I get up and move around I'm fine. So far this medication has been a life saver not to mention a relationship saver!!! I think I'll start takeing it at night so maybe I wont be quite as sleepy during the day. \n",

      "I was first diagnosed with depression which turned out to be very wrong as things got so bad with taking an anti-depressant that I start getting sucidal thoughts and was crying all the time.  Finally, I did my own research and went and saw a mental health doctor that was able to diagnose Bi-polar disorder extremely fast.  Lamictal was the first and only drug I have ever tried for bi-polar and it makes such a difference that I was shocked.  I can't beleive how many years I went thinking my moods were normal.  No more mania where my thoughts race and no more crying either.  I noticed 12 hours or so after taking the pill it must wear off or something becaue my thoughts become fuzzy again.  I now take the pill first thing upon rising and it works fine.  No other side effects really, but if I forget to take the pill for even one day, I do feel a difference.  If you are truly bipolar then give it a shot.  My doctor informs me it's one of the best drugs for bipolar patients as it has very few side effects.  I have been on the drug for a couple years and can't beleive how much better things are.   \n",

      "Eh. That's my review. I tend to find, from myself and others, that these psychological drugs just change the problem. Instead of being depressed you have headaches, blurred vision and mental confusion. Now this is not to say that the switch is bad, it's often better, but it's certainly not optimal. Once you accept this you might feel better about your situation. I have found that the headaches and lack of mental clarity are the worst for me. I'm a grad student so this is certainly not the best fit for me. But as I said earlier, it's better than being depressed and not having the desire to use my mental functions at all. I think that this drugs work best when you are under the careful watch of a doctor who really take the time to have a close relationship with you. Any kind of medication like this could be a short-term solution, a few years maybe. It's a means to an end. The end in this case is dealing with depression, mood swings and anxiety. To many doctors seem to think the medication is the end solution. I really look forward to the day I no longer have to take lamictal or any alternative. As long as you have that goal in mind, you express that clearly to your doctor and he's willing to help you reach that goal, the drug can help in the meantime. You just have to willing to accept the side effects, which as I said, while no fun in their own right, are often preferable to the alternative. \r\n",

I think I have no choice other than back off again to the 300 mg and will consult with my Dr. about this. i can otherwise swear my the Lamictal and believe it has changed my life with its mood-stabilizing abilities. I'm afraid to try anything else as I am in a comfort zone with this med, except for the recent side effects. --A final note: I was also using Abilify as an anti-psychotic but after six months developed tardive dyskinesia, where my tongue began squirming and writhing like it had snakes in it! very bizarre!

THE NAME BRAND, the generic is a different drug all together and dangerous.I developed depression when I was 35 due to a situation beyond my control.I was always a happy person.It got bad.After a few years,I tried antidepressants,made me angry.I went to a psychologist for talk therapy.She said that possibly I was bipolar.I was a workaholic.She recognized it as a mild manic episode,combined with the depression.She suggested I also go see a psychiatrist she knew.I went and the DR. suggested I try a new drug on the market. She was very familiar with it.She had done long studies in her internship for her Doctorate for FDA approval and it was a very promising drug for bipolar.She said she had done other studies and this drug was very successful in controlling bipolar depression.She even said it was the first drug to make such an impact on Bipolar.I was informed of the side effects, especially the rash.I researched it then went back to try it.I made an appointment in 1 month and was told to call at anytime I didn't feel quite right,any side effects,no matter how small.I was told how to slowly work up to a clinical dose 25 mg at a time, increasing weekly.I went back after 3 weeks, the terrible depression and hopelessness went away slowly IN 3 WEEKS! It brought the depression down to a manageable level,changed my life for the better.She even was surprised how fast it worked for me.I don't like meds so I slowly worked up to 175mg.My DR said a clinical dose was at least 200 and usually more. I kept that same dose for a few years until finally I increased it slowly, when I felt the depression coming on. I now take 300mg in the morning after 8years.I've had no side effects unless I forget,shakiness,it reminds me to take it. It scares me to think if I ever can't get it,I'm in trouble.I had severe reactions when I tried 3 generics,double vision,loss of ALL motor control,unable to move a muscle 7 hours 911.The generic is very dangerous. \n",

My doctor says that is a common problem for people on the generic brand. \n",

      "I've had a very strange experience with this medication. I didn't feel ANYTHING at all until I got up to 150mg. It was then that I started feeling the fatigue, strange muscle aches and backpain, lack of interest, lack of the ability to concentrate, strange trembles. My doctor initially suggested I take the medication in the morning because it can cause Insomnia. After two weeks on 150 mg I was instructed to go up to 200 mg. The fatigue became so severe that I would literally count down the hours and minutes until I could leave work, come home and just go to bed. I couldn't handle this so recently I decided to take it in the middle of the afternoon and it has done WONDERS for me. While I'm still getting the benefits of this medication, I don't have to deal with the fatigue or other side effects during the day. I would suggest that people try and be as patient as possible with Lamictal and attempt to find a way to take it that works for you. \n",

      "I was prescribed Lamictal for Bipolar Disorder and admit I was worried to try it. Firstly because I'm a bit medication-phobic and secondly because I had a bad time with both Depakote and Gabapentin. However, I needn't have worried because Lamictal was so much easier for me to tolerate. I had no bad side effects with it at all, very slight sleepiness for the first couple of days and each time I upped the dose, but other than that nothing. Despite the annoying amount of time it takes to titrate to a helpful dose, it is definitely worth doing it sensibly to lower the chances of the dreaded rash. I started on 25mg a day and week by week increased by 25mg until I reached the 200mg a day that I take now. I have found 200 to be effective for me and am sticking with that for the time being. I know there is still further room to increase if I need it. I have only been on Lamictal since January, so 8 months now, but in that time my moods have been much more stable. I still have slight lows and slight highs but instead of my moods flying uncontrollably between -10 to +10 now it's more like -4 to +4 - I never quite seem to get any higher than slight hypomania nor any lower than slight depressions. For me this drug has helped massively. \n",

The doctor seems to think that the bipolar disorder is a bigger problem than the alzheimer's.  He is an alcoholic as well.  He has had to grown sons commit suicide.  Four other grown children , I suspect have some type of disorder as well.  Their mother is an alcoholic.  I am thankful that he and I never had children together.  He lives in an independent living facility for the past three years as my traveling job prevents me from taking care of him, he cannot be left alone.  They are having complaints about him now.  He steals small things when they take him shopping.  His comments always border on sexual and his behavior in general is very inappropriate, even in front of total strangers.  I don't know what I will do with him next.  I feel they are getting weary of him there.  I have no help financially or otherwise from his remaining 4 grown children.  He is taking Lamotrigine, Aricept and Fluoxitine for his depression.  Please, any suggestions would be appreciated.  I am at a financial loss and am having such a hard time emotionally with this as well. He is 77 years of age. \n",

      "I have my life back. I could leave it at that. But I would like to tell you HOW. I have been suffering with bipolar 2 for 6 years now. I literally thought I had become a crazy, worthless person. I couldn't remember conversations with co-workers and I think I was about to lose my job. My boss told me to see a psychiatrist. He is a good guy...I think that was going to be the last attempt for him to help me before firing me. I used to be a highly functioning person. I managed to graduate from college with a 3.2 GPA without going to class even 50% of the time. I loved physical activity and reading and music. 6 years ago everything changed. I was in a grad program and failed out. I was going to class and studying constantly but I was having major memory problems. Then I started having depression, then hypomanic episodes. I was just a complete mess. My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal slowly while slowly weaning me off of Lexapro. Now I am at 400mg daily and I feel wonderful. I am back to being a highly active, functioning person. I am me for the first time in 6 years. My husband is delighted--he only knew me AFTER the bipolar set in. He has loved me through all of this, but now he is just amazed at what a better person I have become. Still me, obviously, but without all of the drama. :-) Not every drug is right for everyone. Lamictal was just the one that was right for me. I am a success story. I am so happy to have my life back.  \n",

I can handle the hair loss to a certain extent, but I will consider other options if it gets to be too much. My short term memory is a lot worse than it was before beginning Lamictal. I've addressed the issue with my doc and she said that it is a symptom of bipolar, not a side effect of the drug. I don't agree necessarily. I've always had memory issues, but I noticed a drastic decline when I started the drug. Again, if it gets too much worse I'll consider an alternate treatment. Besides those two very frustrating side effects I've been very pleased with my moods. I take 300 mg and 300 mg Wellbutrin and the combo is working well so far. I also have ringing of the ears due to the Wellbutrin, but that's a story for another day LOL.  \n",

      "My best advice to anyone with depression and/or bi-polar disorder is to try any meds that are offered or are available.  It took a while to find the medications that worked for me.  Don't be worried about taking more than one drug either.  I have been taking Lamictal for 3 1/2 YEARS.  I am taking 400 mg and have been for most of that time period.  I have had excellent results on this med, and have had no side effects at all, ever, nor have I had any significant weight gain.  This medicine has worked wonderful for ME.  It has stabilized my mood dramatically.  I also take Wellbutrin 450 mg, and Seroquel 100 mg.  This is the \"cocktail\" of meds that have worked for me.  As I said, I have been on this combo of drugs for 3 1/2 years.  Medicine affects everyone differently.  Don't think that just because one person had serious side effects that you will also.  This medicine may be just what you need.  Sometimes you have to trust the doctor more than the reviewers.  The doctors know what the side effects may be.  They are in no way trying to hurt you!  They trying to help you the only way they know how!  Good luck and God bless you!  There is hope, just don't give up! \n",

This is the information I wish i WOULD have known about before i took Lamictal and it changed my life forever, and definitely not for the better. Am in contant pain now after SJS almost claimed my life. Yes, you should all ask your doctor's questions, many questions. But the scary pictures are the truth and what people do need to see. My doctor told me starting out slow and on the 25mg for 1st week, 50 for second and 75mg for 3rd, it could possibly DECREASE the chance, NOT completely eliminate it. Everryone please be careful. Any signs of a \"rash\" puffy swollen eyes or fever headache..ANYTHING like this..please tell your dr.

Has really helped w/ Bi-polar type II, evening out the symtoms (higs & lows) much more effectively than any other phyc. drug I've taken (dealing w/ bi-polar issues for 15+ yrs.)It took 2 months to show positive results but worth the wait!! I take it in combination w/seroquel 50 mgs.per day for sleep.I'm adding lexapro for obsessive negative thoughts that I've been dealing w/ for years - used major trancs.for in the past. One negative side effect was when I first started taking lamictal I actually lost (temporarily) my ability to spell even very simple words. Lamictal does not have any sexual side affects nor does it put you in a stupor like some of the other major players do. \n",

Now 3 yrs later, that pesky bipolar depression is back and effecting my job, so for insurance reasons, I have been taking the generic version,lamotrogine, which is not as effective as lamictal. I have been on lamotrogine for about a year now (50mg). I get a bad headache if I don't take it on time, I feel like it is not working as well as it did at first and i am slowly becoming a space cadet. Dizzy, forgetful, confused, unmotivated. I have been bipolar for so long and tried soooo many different meds. none of them have been the answer, but lamictal worked the best so far...NOT LAMOTROGINE. Side note on the other meds i have tried: Paxil, Prozac and Wellbutrin =zombie. adderall and ritalin= heart palpatations, major anxiety, shaky, difficulty breathing. (ritalin less bothersome than adderall) Trileptil (oxcarbenzapine)= major allergic reaction (swollen itchy red blistery hands and a rash, but steroids was quickly administered. It wasn't as bad as the other person below. (I feel for you.) I advise when taking any new meds, do it in the daytime when your drs office is open and while someone is with you, just in case of an allergic reaction. A Dr. visit is always cheaper than the emergency room. If you are like me, you just want to feel somewhat productive in this life and not so out of it all the time. Bottom line is that everyone is different and YOU are your best advocate, so speak up and do your research if somethings not working. \n",

      "Lamictal has changed my life.and unfortunately not for the better. I started taking Lamictal in 2002.and almost 7 years later I am still suffering the effects Lamictal has left on me. As a result of taking Lamictal,I developed Stevens Johnson Syndrome...this is the \"rash\" the doctor's might tell you about as a side effect. SJS however is far more than that. If you get this so called \"rash\" from Lamictal...it gives you a reaction that litterally makes your skin peel off and blister and cause your skin to have chemical burns from the inside out. This was an extremely awful and painful experience. I was in the burn center for 6 weeks and gave me a ventilator, because the skin on my lungs was sloughing off as a result of the medication and I couldn't breathe on my own. I would give anything to go back and never have taken Lamictal. Maybe for some people, when you have no other option, you might have to use it as a last resort..but for me their were so many other options. You also have to watch out for swollen lymph nodes this could be a sign that you are getting an allergic reaction. The chemical burns from the Lamictal made it so there were blisters in my eyes and now I have unbearable eye pain and eye problems. My eyes do not look normal I have redness pain, dry eye syndrome,(severe,I have to use eyedrops about 10-20 times a day) photophobia,trichiasis,blepharitis,droopy,swollen eyelids, and constant eye infections because of this. I have scars and have also lost all my fingernails and toenails because I lost my nail beds as a direct result of Lamictal. I also am very sensitive to hot and cold temperature and cannot be out for long periods of time.IMPORTANTIf you get SJS..it MIGHT NOT STOP AFTER YOU STOP THE MEDS... IT MAY HAVE TO RUN ITS COURSE!Now,if you are thinking, this happened to just one of those people who are one out of a million, you are wrong The risk is a lot higher than you think. just please be careful and ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME \n",

I noticed some acne and now I have devoloped another itchy rash this time small red bumps on my legs, back & chest. I went to the Dr today and was told that \"the lamictal rash is a blister rash\" apply a different Rx cream & \"just keep an eye on it.\" I have never had a problem with rashes before taking this medicine and I can't help but think that even though not the life threating oozing \"lamictal rash\" it is still being caused by this medicine. \n",

I kinda liked having the hypomania part of the disorder at least then people liked to be around me. I know others have noticed a change in me because they tell me they don't like my attitude, and I have to work with ALOT of people and care for teenagers who are brutally honest. Im sick of explaining myself. I was diagnoised 2months ago and still havent gotten better I cry all the time and Im very angry and I fight with my partner all day every day. I hate how I feel why does it take so long why don't the doctors really listen Im sorry but they are a joke. I don't even know if I agree with them about being bipolar everyone else that knows me and that I have worked with for 7yrs feel im not and just think Im ADHD which that is what I agree with. But no damn doctors won't listen Im really about to bug on them and tell them about themselves Im the one paying them and for what to feel like crap everyday what a joke. I just want to be happy and function and be the best that I can be as a mother, counselor and wife. This medication has sucked the joy out of me which prior to had none anyways but somehow I do feel worse, and this rash thing scares the crap out of me. I have enough medical problems as it is don't need anymore, and I am very young I just want to enjoy life instead of wanting to end it... \n",

      "Lamictal has changed my life....and unfortunately...not for the better. I started taking Lamictal in 2002...and almost 7 years later I am still suffering the effects Lamictal has left on me. As a result of taking Lamictal,I developed Stevens Johnson Syndrome...this is the \"rash\" the doctor's might tell you about as a side effect. SJS however is far more than that. If you get this so called \"rash\" from Lamictal...it gives you a reaction that litterally makes your skin peel off and blister and cause your skin to have chemical burns from the inside out. This was an extremely awful and painful experience. Lamictal sent me to the burn center for 6 weeks and gave me a ventilator, because the skin on my lungs was sloughing off as a result of the medication and I couldn't breathe on my own. I would give anything to go back and never have taken Lamictal. Maybe for some people, when you have no other option, you might have to use it as a last resort..but for me their were so many other options. You also have to watch out for swollen lymph nodes this could be a sign that you are getting an allergic reaction. The chemical burns from the Lamictal made it so there were blisters in my eyes and now I have unbearable eye pain and eye problems. My eyes do not look normal I have redness pain, dry eye syndrome,(severe,I have to use eyedrops about 10-20 times a day) photophobia,trichiasis,blepharitis,droopy,swollen eyelids, and constant eye infections because of this. I have scars and have also lost all my fingernails and toenails because I lost my nail beds as a direct result of Lamictal. I also am very sensitive to hot and cold temperature and cannot be our for long periods of time. It is such a hassle and has hindered me in life. Now,if you are thinking, this happened to just one of those unlucky people who are one out of a million, you are wrong The risk is a lot higher than you think. It is 1/100. just please be careful and ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME. God Bless \n",

      "I was diagnosed Bipolar- II almost two years ago.Lamictal and Zoloft were the first drugs that were prescribed for me. I never felt right on the Zoloft or any SSRI or SNRI for that matter. I got up to the 300mg doses of lamictal and felt it had stopped being as effective as it was in the beginning. This took 1/2 year to poop out. I then started looking for alternatives as my Doc. at the time just wanted me to slowly increase lamictal, yet I felt I needed another med. Well, I went back to my first Doc. that diagnosed me, and tried different meds., but after reading a book called Bi-polar II, from the library I found that the gold standard, for Bi-polar is Lithium Carbonate ER. So I suggested this to my doc. and I have been taking it along with 150mg Lamictal for less than a week. I tell you, I have felt some calmness, and peace with the Lithium add-on already and look forward to more. She only started me at 300mg twice a day. We will do bloodwork soon to see if I need an increase for the theraputic level. I just wanted to pass this along to others, as lithium was the first med. available to treat bipolar and sometimes docs. go with the newer meds. that the drug companies produce. It may have side effects, check them out with your doc. So far though I have been excercising 30min. a day and cutting out gluten and sugars, eating more good carbs. and protein, no weight gain yet. I tell you the side effects may be so minimal for me that I don't feel anything but benefit for Lithium so far. I'll keep you posted.\r\n",

This is the first medication I have ever taken that has not given me side effects and that in itself makes a wonder drug for me!!  Taking this medication in conjunction with cognitive therapy is now a lifestyle for me and has improved my quality of life dramatically.  I experienced slight weight gain after the first month, but have since been able to maintain my weight through diet and exercise, something i was unable to do while on prozac (which caused horrible weight gain for me).  Both the generic and brand name lamictal are expensive.  if you do not have prescription insurance, go to www.bridgestoaccess.com and see if you qualify for GSK's help.  I qualified and now receive the brand name for free.  This program also includes many other GSK drugs so it is well worth looking into. (I receive my wellbutrin for free as well).

When I woke up I very shakily drove the mile to my family drs office, and they gave me fluids, but weren't sure what was happening. I was still shaky, so I stopped at my pharmacy on my way home, and talked to the pharmacist. Right away, he informed me that I couldn't take any kind of decongestant with this medicine.  It will cause the same symptoms I went through (which, btw, leaves you with verrry little options.)  When I informed my psych doctor what I had gone through, she looked it up in her medical journal, and NO where did it say that you couldn't take a decongestant, so she was clueless.

I have had a sick feeling all over since I started this stuff. I'm actually fighting with my doctor because I want to go off this drug.

      "After years of not knowing what was wrong with me and being on various antidepressants, I was finally diagnosed as bipolar II about 2 yrs ago. I'm on Lamictal 150-200mg a day. It varies due to the fact that at 200mg I get horrible migraines. At that point my ARNP will lower my dose to 150mg for a short time and then when I feel ready to live witht the headaches again we bump it back up. This usually only takes me a week or two of being at the lower dose before I want to be bumped back up. Two Hundred mg seems to be just where I need to be at to stabilize me. This to me is a WONDER DRUG. I was suicidal when I started on it. I started on the 5 wk starter pack and by the 3 wk I was feeling sooooooooo much better! I've done nothing but get better each day. I highly recommend it. I've always had a high sex drive but on Lamictal it's even higher, which my husband isn't complaining about! :-) The weight gain that I'm currently expiriencing does bother me and it's extremely hard to try and lose the weight once it's put on. I did try for 3 days to add Topamax w/Lamictal. Bad idea for me. Topamax made me fuzzy and unable to function. With Lamictal, I know now what it's like to be a \"normal\" person, the mood swings are still there but aren't severe anymore. I still have bouts of depression but not like before where I couldn't function at all. I'm now on the generic version and at this time haven't expirienced any adverse effects from switching to it. \n",

      "I have had problems with anxiety and depression in severe bouts. I'd be fine and feel normal for months, sometimes a year at a time an then I'd be horribly anxious for months at a time. My primary cares always tried SSRI's which ALWAYS made me vomit and sent me to the ER. I was nervous about taking this medication but desperate because recently it had gotten to the point of me feeling so disconnected from everything that I was scratching myself just to feel something. I started Lamictal on the smallest starter kit the doctor had. I'm just going into week 5. The only thing I've had a problem with is anxiety. It's not worse but it's still there. But I'll take anxiety that I'm used to over overwhelming depression any day. I have an appointment today with the psychiatrist so maybe she will give me something for anxiety that works. Also, one weird side effect I noticed was this kinda ringing in my ears. It's not really like tinnitus (which I get sometimes)but it's more like when it's so quiet in a room that the quiet is deafening. Not sure if that makes sense but that's how I experience it. It's not a huge problem though. I've also notice a moderate increase in sex drive, which I'm not complaining about. \n",

Halfway into the third week is when I started to feel a slight improvement in my overwhelming depression at 25mg Lamictal daily.  I went from 100mg to 200mg of Zoloft and didn't feel a change until I took it in combination with Lamictal.

Then i went back because depression  symtoms came back stronger than ever. Then he perscribed effexor xr. While on effexor I lost my job and thought i was loosing my mind i was going crazy. Effexor has dangerious side effects that are terrible for a bi-polar person. I went back. He said that poopout is common with bi-polar people. He wouldnt comment on the effexor side effects. He gave me the bi-polar/seisure drug lamictal. Said it works for both. Been on it for 4 months. Practically no side effects and no more being tired. And feel level headed. Without the manic moods. Even though I liked the up's without the downs. This Lamictal is good stuff. I split my dosage to 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the evening. Works better for me. I give it 5 stars. The depression is 95% gone and the mood swings are 99% gone. Does not help with weight gain. But thats more mind over what you eat. I feel alot better than i have in the last 13 years now.

      "Had major breakdown, 2nd one. Took Lamictal with Prozac.  Initial side-effects: sleepiness, no energy, I could feel my head being different for the first couple of weeks, dosage was eventually at 300mg, and was accompanied by severe migraines that would last for days. Dr. felt that counseling would help. I still have headaches, but less frequent and less severe, definately able to deal with. My issues with bi-polar- impulsiveness, sexual mania, 30# wt. loss, suicidal thoughts, sleeplessness, along with major depression. after maybe 6 months or so, dosage felt right, I felt stable, not feeling so out of control. I HATE taking the meds every day.  I was going to wean off once condition was in \"remission\". The two breakdowns each involved a suidide attempt and I have 6 kids. Not a risk I have decided to take. I have probably had earlier episodes, but was undiagnosed until severe breakdown. Breakdowns were majorly stress induced. Never thought I would go there again after first episode, but I did, approximately 8-9 years apart. I hope medication will keep disease and my health and safety safety. I am not at a therapeutic dose of 150mg with 60mg of Prozac. I have been feeling a little of the old sick self, so I may go back up. Everytime I change dose up or down I have sleep issues. Usually inability to sleep followed by sleeping for long periods. If I miss a dose I notice I have sleep issues, although only for a day or two. It takes alot of patience to get to dose that is right for you and finding the anti-depressant that may also be needed. This is a chemical imbalance...no different than high cholestrol, don't be deterred, not everyone has a respect for mental health. It may be what saves your life and give you a quality of life with your family. If not this med, then maybe another. Work with your Dr. \n",

I have had the side effect of grinding my teeth, tightening my jaw and sucking or grinding the sides of my cheeks into my teeth.  As a result, the inside of my mouth is always sore.  When I first started taking it, it negatively impacted my driving.  I wasn't as aware as I should have been and found myself cutting people off, running into curbs and once backed into another car because I didn't notice it.  Fortunately, this has subsided and I am once again a safe driver.  My cycles are better with it, but not gone.  The doctor added Abilify during the last two yeaers and I was doing great.  During the last two weeks I have tried eliminating the Abilify, as it is so expensive.  I have now felt quite depressed, overwhelmed and edgy for about a week.  Definitely going back on the Abilify.  As I have never tried Abilify without the Lamictal, it might just be that the Abilify is what is \"fixing\" me and the Lamictal is doing nothing.  When I am good and stable again with the Abilify, I might try leaving off the Lamictal to see what happens.     \n",

      "I began taking 400 mg of Lamictal ODT last week. I started out at 200 mg two years ago and have gradually increased over time. 150 to 200, then 300 to 350, and as of one week ago, 400 mg. My doctor had adjusted the dosage to help stabilize my mood swings. I also take Buproprion SR (150 mg) and Clonazepam (.5 mg). I take Adderall (30 mg) for my ADD. Since my recent increase with my Lamictal, in a week I have noticed blurred vision, very red eyes, nausea, and I am quick to anger (I've dealt with the anger issue pretty much since the increase around 300 mg). I dread dissolving the 2 pills in my mouth- you can only stand to dissolve those pills for so long. Lamictal was very helpful in my earlier and lower dosages. I think now some modifications need to be made to the 400 mg. since these side effects began and have now worsened, it's become scary. Lamictal also reduced the effectiveness of my birth control. I became unexpectedly pregnant, resulting in miscarriage b/c of the \"cocktail\" of drugs I take everyday.  \n",

The first week I noticed that I still had symptoms of insomnia, suicidal thoughts, rapid thoughts and voices, along with things not really being there. These symptoms became mild that I was about to feel much better than I had been within the past couple years. I was referred to some many doctors and no one knew what was causing these symptoms, until I had a full blow manic attack that I ended up being hospitalized for. This was the first time someone gave me the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, so finally I figured out that someone was indeed wrong with me, not just in my head. I've been taking the 200mg now for about four months now and I can see the difference along with my family. I've been told, \"wow you look like yourself today\" which is something amazing to me. Though I do take other medicines to treat the various aspects of bipolar disorder, but I have found this one to be the most helpful. And I recommend to everyone NEVER stop taking this medicine cold turkey, because you feel like you are going down a dark alley and will have all the side effects come to you at once.  \n",

I research before I swallow and as a rule, I try to take as few pills as possible.  So adding Lamictal to my treatment did not make me happy. However, I had reached my medication plateau on Cymbalta and wanted to avoid having to try yet another antidepressant. This medication seems to do just that.  I have been able to keep my dose of Cymbalta at 60mg working smoothly, even if I miss a dose.  It was rough at first. It takes a few weeks for the body to adjust ,even at a 100mg doses, but two months later it was well worth it.  Once it kicks in, going to 200 is no problem.  I do keep an eye on my blood pressure.

It's not bad and doesn't hurt. Highly recommend it. Stops depression on the spot. Lamictal when used with other meds can be a real life saver and it keeps the mood swings farther apart. Nothing can ever cure BP so the best thing to do is structure your life around eating,exercising for those with weight gain plus it gets the endorphins firing off which feels good, getting regular sleep no matter what. The brain relies on structured environments when its biochemistry is out of order. Taking good care of yourself and educating the people around you who care for you and enlisting them to help you see the signs of relapse. Meds and cognitive behavioral therapy are the best you can get. DO NOT GO OFF YOUR MEDS. People with BP will always have it - no magic cure - so figure out ways to keep the swings apart. Taking Lamictal is part of what I do before bed...every night. \n",

I had struggled with taking different medications and was concerned about side effects of anti psychotics that might dull creativity, make me feel foggy or gain weight. On lamotrogine I have experienced none of these side effects whatsoever. It takes a little while to work after titrating up slowly (I started at 25mg and now take 400) but it has honestly been amazing. I no longer have mood swings or depression, my mind is far more rational, my concentration has tripled. I know different medications work for different people but I think lamotrogine is worth giving a go and sticking at it while you titrate up. If it works as it has done for me youâ??ll have no side effects. My quality of life has improved and I hope others can benefit in the same way. \n",

      "FOR WOMEN TO READ:  Started using lamotrigine 25mg a day and stepped up to 75mg a day.  Within 3 days of taking the 75mg dose I began to experience a form of female genital disorder. I developed an extremely pungent smell down there that I have NEVER had before taking this pill.  And within a few days of stopping it, the smell was gone.  I know it wasn't female problems b/c I had no other female related symptoms, just the smell. This is very embarrassing to write, even though no one will know who wrote this personally; however the side effect was even more embarrassing. Since it is listed as one of the \"very rare\" side effects, I feel obligated as a woman to share my experience for other women to keep an eye out for in case they develop this.  Female genital disorder has only recently been added as a side effect.  I am the person who never gets the common side effects so I searched for hours before I found only 2 other people with the same report. As for the effectiveness of the medication for treating mood disorders, I found out how effective it had been once I got off of it, so I would have stayed on it had it not been for that one issue. \n",

See, I experience bad mania (I should mention I'm 40 years old, a male, and have bipolar type 1), not so much depression, though let's not discount it.  While being on Lamictal I was experiencing manic episodes left and right.  It wasn't until I came back to Lithium that my moods were stabilized.  So I am unconvinced of it effectiveness.  But this is just my experience.  I was put on 400mg at first, after tapering up on it to avoid the dangerous rash, and stayed there for years.  Then I began noticing memory problems.  I would have entire conversations and then repeat myself later.  I would forget things.  I became a time traveler, in short.  In consultation with my doctor we decided to cut back.  I went to 200mg and then settled at 100mg, where I am now.  Now I am on hardly any Lamictal and I still don't know what its for.  I hope one of you find out and that it works wonders for you. \n",

While on SSRIs and manic, I created three unwanted pregnancies, got busted for drugs, developed a cigarette habit, quit several good jobs for petty reasons, became a heavy drinker, had short and failed relationships with women, spent money foolishly, and went bankrupt. Mine is one of the sad stories of people who went untreated/misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and proceeded to cause a lot of hardship for myself and others. To this day I still feel shame for my failures, yet at the same time I berate myself less since understanding the cause of my past behavior. My cigarette habit went away after I switched from SSRIs to Wellbutrin. Now I feel healthier and grateful. No cravings whatsoever. I take 1 mg Ativan as needed; about every one to six days. I wish I received my bipolar diagnosis 20+ years ago as my life might be very different now. I still have many years left if all goes well, so better late than never. \n",

I wouldn't say I'm very manic - I mostly have the lows, not so much the highs. I've been stable for about 5 or 6 years now with no problems and I make sure to stay that way but limiting my alcohol intake and pretty much eliminating any recreational drug use. I find that I am always much better off with my meds if I'm consistantly sober. I also exercise a lot and get enough sleep. One side effect I have is my libido is pretty much nonexistant, but I've been on these meds since before I was sexually active so I cannot say for sure that the meds are what causes that. This is the reason I am on here though - to see if anyone else has this problem. Overall I really appreciate everything Lamictal has done for me. \r\n",

I was on lithium for ten years, but replaced it a month ago for lamyctal.  I'm also take Wellbutrin, buspar, inderal and thyroid meds. I'm on disability for mental illness after losing my job due to stress and my husband's cancer, which made my symptons worse than they've been for a while, especially the anxiety and emotional instability.

I have the severe symptoms of Bipolar type I and struggled for 8 years to consistently feel like myself with no luck. I've seen a lot of comments on side affects but I have had none. It started working 6-8 weeks into the treatment and got rid of my manic episodes which were intense. Now I'm 3years into using the drug. I have missed dosages a few times do to my not refilling on schedule and after 2-3days my symptoms flare up. So there you have it. No anti-depressants and just lost of excercise, Seroquel to also help with the mania/ depression and positive people in my life. These other factors inpact overall effectiveness and satisfaction.

Instead of being depressed you have headaches, blurred vision and mental confusion.  Now this is not to say that the switch is bad, it's often better, but it's certainly not optimal.

To many doctors seem to think the medication is the end solution.  I really look forward to the day I no longer have to take lamictal or any alternative.  As long as you have that goal in mind, you express that clearly to your doctor and he's willing to help you reach that goal, the drug can help in the meantime.  You just have to willing to accept the side effects, which as I said, while no fun in their own right, are often preferable to the alternative.    \n",

      "I finally was diagnoised with bpd/depression when I was 50 yrs old. Up til then i was only treated for depression. I of course tried many bpd medications and lamictal was the only one to finally help and did almost immediately now after getting up to 75 mg and 6 months of 20 mg of celexa I'm moving up to 100 of lamictal and 40 of celexa.  I'm look forward to the balance of emotions that I need especially with my husband being terminally ill its hard to control depression right now. But the mania is so much better!!!! \n",

      "Took the maintenance dose for half a year. The following side effects were experienced: yawning constantly/eyes watering, fatigue/tired/ emotional numbing, easily bruising/petechiae down both of my arms quite often, weight gain.  You might think that \"emotional numbing\" would be an appropriate result for this indication (suspected bipolar); however, just a couple weeks after all the medications were out of my system I was much happier and felt a *normal* range of emotions again.  Have not taken drugs since (5 yrs) and have been fine and successful, looking to get into med school.  Worse (and common) side effect: cognitive/memory impairment- to the point of very frequently having my mind go blank during conversations or contemplating things, also my short term memory was shot. I do not see how one could take this drug and \"function\" (really live).  Be wary of this diagnosis in the first place- demand that any organic medical cause (especially thyroid disease as it features psychiatric symptoms) be found and treated first, and optimize your diet and lifestyle. Best wishes. \n",

      "I was diagnosed as bipolar(manic/depressive)on 10/23/2008. I was prescribed lamotrigine and seroquel. I was slowly brought up to 100 mg. I started cycling rapidly in December. My depression cycle wasn't nearly as depressed as usual(always dreaded the down side.)My practitioner went over how and when I was to take seroquel and increased my Seroquel dose to 100mg, but left my lamotrigine dose at 100mg since it seemed to be working for the depressive episodes . In the 5th month i had an extremely mean manic episode for three days, followed by 2 days of extreme depression where I couldn't leave the house without crying, pretty much, the whole time I was out. My dose was increased to  200mg/day and my seroquel was also increased to 200mg. Within a month I felt better and I finally am thinking more clearly. I'm starting to think I can trust my own judgement again. \r\n",

After the fourth hour I start to have speech problems, disorientation, and my head starts to shake as though I have a neuromuscular problem.

In the past 6 mos. these symptoms have become more intense, especially the back/hip pain and inability to fall sleep at night, as well as now experiencing some hair loss and a loss in my ability to concentrate. My psychiatrist felt this was due to stress, but I have become concerned after reading more about the drugs I am taking. My family physician does not feel there is any danger in the combination of pills I am taking, but also recommended that I trust my body's reactions. If I miss taking my meds for just one day, I am lethargic, sleepy, cranky and feel ill usually within 2-3 hours. When this happens on a weekend day, I will hole myself up and not leave the house. After reading all of the posts on this site, I want to see about talking with another pyschiatrist and the possibility of going off this medication. Please remember this is just my experience with Lamictal and besides the other medications, I'm sure there are many other variables in my situation.  \n",

      "I take 250mg of Lamictal a day along w/300 mg of Effexor.  Sounds like alot, but I have a high tolerance for pain and drugs.  Been on both for 4 years now - increased dose from 200 to 250 after coming off of meds during a pregnancy.  Was diagnosed bipolar at the age of 29 when mania set in. I love it - saved my life and my husbands. He had actually attempted suicide a few times before I was able to convince him to go to the doctor. He had social anxiety as well (which I think all bipolar people have).  You can't miss a pill and expect it to work - kind of like birth control. But the daily pill is worth the happiness, satisfaction and focus it brings to your life. I feel normal for the 1st time in my life.  I recently started taking the generic when it became available (so much cheaper), but after reading other's comments I think I'm going to go back to brand name.  I've been itching like crazy too - thought it was allergies.  And my mood swings have been wider with a poorer attention span.  I go to the doctor in a couple of days and was going to ask for a higher dose - I think switching back to name brand will relieve the new symptoms.  When I did quit taking the meds for my pregnancy I was so miserable - the only thing that kept alive were the babies inside me.  Had twins and didn't hold them but once or twice for the first week.  If anyone out there has stayed on lamictal throughout a prenancy (with or without issues) I would love to hear from you.  I want to try for another baby, but I'm not sure I (or my husbandd) can make it w/out the medicine. Good luck to all, I know how hard it is to find the right combo of drugs.  Just don't give up. \n",

      "I have Bipolar 1 and I am 16 years old.  I was diagnosed February my freshmen year of high school and they put me on Lamictal in June.  It treated some of my symptoms in the first month: extreme interest in sex, delusional thinking, depression, and others I can't even remember because they stopped.  I am a junior and I have been taking it.  I still have episodes and I am on Seroquel as well, but I do not have major depressive episodes anymore. I thought I was crazy before I took this medicine.  I didn’t want to live anymore and I thought I was just a sick twisted person.  It turns out I was sick, but not the monster I thought I was.  This medicine changed my life and saved me from myself.  When you first start taking it, the first week or two you are tired, but it goes away as your body adjusts.  Lamictal is a really good treatment for teenagers suffering from manic, depressive and hyper-manic episodes (Especially depressive: I was suffering depression my entire freshmen year until I got help).   Make sure that when you make changes with any kind of medication (doses or starting new ones), you do it when you are on some sort of break where you can adjust without stress and sleep.  I’m not sure how it works for others, everyone has different brain chemistries, but Lamictal works very well for me. \n",

I did some research and learned that, while uncommon, when lamotrigine does have an adverse effect, it is a serious one. My reaction appeared within 30 minutes of taking it and manifested as the worst flu ever - violent vomiting, severe migraine, uncontrollable chills and shaking, and dangerously low blood pressure. In the following two weeks I was confused, light-headed, and very weak. It took over two weeks for my blood pressure to return to normal. These episodes surprised (and terrified) me, because not only was this a low dose, but I have never before had a bad reaction to a medication. ANY drug has the potential to do harm as well as good. That doesn't mean you should not try taking something; it just means you need to be aware of the possibility, AND you need to trust your own instincts.

      "I find it odd that so many people have such bad reviews yet also take an other prescribed medication. You have to take into consideration the fact that this medication reacts differently when there are multiple medications in your system. My doctor suggested Lamictal to me first for bipolar 2 disorder. I refused to take it because I had heard about the rash / stephen johnson syndrome, it had always been a fear so I absolutely refused to try it. I tried Abilify first, It seemed to change my life for the best until I started becoming exhausted and could barely walk down the street without having to rest. Could barely drive without having to take a nap on the side of the road. Turned out to be a side effect and I was taken off. I tried lithium as it was \"affordable\" and typical, it did nothing good for me, I was having awful mixed states, sudden crying spells, overly sensitive, and could not sit still for a minute, nothing improved so he took me off of it. Even with just two trials I told the doctor \"fine, i'll try lamictal\" well, about a year later it's changed my life for the good. I hate relying on medication but in all honesty the way this has helped me is well worth some sort of reliance. This was mostly to treat my depression, I don't get depressed as much anymore. I do have a phase here and there but it is much less severe than it used to be, i'll feel down but not so suicidal and completely worthless anymore. I will say though that the past two weeks have been interesting, I cannot tell what state I am in, I have once again become overly sensitive and easily irritable, the physical pain i've been in lately has been so confusing and awful (numb hands, tingling, crying, headaches, feeling light headed) very strange signs. Could easily be from something else but it's almost as if the meds just quit working out of the blue. However although i'm dealing with this, the depression is still nothing compared to what it used to be.  \n",

      "I have been on Effexor, Buspirone, Zoloft, Trazadone, Wellbutrin, Prozac, Klonopin over the years and this was by far the worst reaction I've ever had with a med. I was started on 25mg to move up after 1 week to 50 and was on it 5 days. The first few days I had severely painful headaches with pressure, my face twitches, my eyes rolled and darted back and forth and my jaw was clenched constantly. I had an extremely painful and stiff neck. Day 3 the pain was in all my muscles and joints and I had tremors. Day 5 and things got so bad I nearly went to an ER. 9 pm at night I started feeling like I was having a panic attack (I do have panic disorder). It felt as if my chest was in a vice grip and I couldn't breathe, my heart was beating rapidly/starting and stopping, pounding, I could see it pulse through my stomach. I had cramping in my abdomen and my neck was so stiff I couldn't move it. I did not sleep but more than that I couldn't move for hours. I laid in the fetal position completely wide eyed and in a state of what I mistook to be panic. My panic attacks have never lasted more than an hour or two. This lasted for 16 hours. I had to work in the morning and went to work on 0 sleep and all of symptoms kept worsening. I also had class but decided to go home to try to sleep because I was in so much pain. I started to put two and two together when everything in my body lit on fire. It felt like I had a sunburn, especially on my chest and back and neck. I called my prescriber and they said to stop taking it and to take the hydroxyzine because \"it sounds like the beginning of an allergic reaction\" as well as adverse effects. That makes it sound like they're competent and concerned...they aren't. They pushed this drug on me even though I was hesitant. It's five days later and only now am I starting to feel slightly back to normal but my face is still clenching and ticking and I'm still in pain. It took a few days for my pulse to even out, too.

      "I had been on the brand name \"Lamictal\" for about 6 years w/o issues. It has worked wonderfully for my manic episodes. The last two years I was switched to the generic brand by my insurance. During this time I had began getting a serious rash and redness and rash on my neck area, this past year I have developed blotches on my shoulders and upper arms as well as the shoulder blade areas. It is slowly working its way down my arms and back. My doctor gave me an ointment prescription which is working, but has concerns of the effects being related to Lamictal. He is weening me off due to the potential seriousness of this side affect. I am disappointed with this as the drug has worked perfectly for my condition, however, I appreciate his legitimate concern. I almost wonder if the generic brand may be the difference in my skin condition, where it has changed since being on the generic brand, rather than the name brand Lamictal oral. Regardless, should my rash subside once off the med completely, I will need to have a replacement med which i dread the experimental stage of alternatives. Lamictal has been perfect for me. I hate the thought of experimenting with other drugs due to concerns of being drowsy, high or always groggy from any particular med. I had once been on Depakote, which was a total nightmare.

The migraines are getting better, less frequent...but the congestion remains.  Overall I am fairly satisfied with this drug.

When I came out of that, I was an arrogant Bitch who thought she deserved better. Then I would suddenly feel inspired to get things done and have a normal day. I could feel my adderall working on those days. I could focus, but everything was short lived.\r\n",

About a month went by, then 2 weeks, and I met with my PA. I felt very laid back about chaos in my life. I didn't notice anything different. My attitude and quality of life had not improved on the Generic. but it hadn't really gotten worse. I felt like I always had. She switched me back to brand name and things started to improve again. Now taking tablets instead of ODT because of Medicaid. I notice quite a difference in side effects. Has anyone else switched? Effectiveness/infectiveness? \n",
