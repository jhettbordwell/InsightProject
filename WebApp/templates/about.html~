    <h1>What is PsychedUp?</h1>
    <p>PsychedUp is a web app designed to help patients and their caregivers get involved in the
      discussion around the psychiatric medications they are being prescribed. When given a
      preliminary diagnosis for a pscyhiatric condition, many of us don't know where to begin with
      regards to researching what medications might address our concerns around side effects and
      changes to our lifestyle, or simply don't have the mental space or emotional energy to
      engage in such research. Further, the amount of information out there on different treatments,
      their side effects and interactions, and the experiences of those who have tried different
      medications are spread across many sources, including forums and sites with reviews. This
      only serves to make the process more overwhelming.</p>
    <p>PsychedUp aims to change the process of performing this research to be more user-friendly, by
      allowing a patient or caregiver to enter information on the diagnosis, the age and gender of
      the patient, and their major concerns for side effects and lifestyle changes, and returning
      a list of potentially suitable medications and some graphics summarizing reviews that will be
      relevant, and how people have felt about the medication. Further, PsychedUp will provide
      links to the sources of information it reviewed, so that a patient or caregiver has some leads
      if they would like to delve further into the research.</p>
    <h1>How does PsychedUp work?</h1>
    <p>PsychedUp looks at information on different treatment plans from
      <a href="https://www.nami.org/">NAMI</a>, side effect and interaction information from
      <a href="https://www.drugs.com/">Drugs.com</a>, and user medication review information from
      <a href="https://www.webmd.com/">WebMD</a>. The app analyzes the text from the user reviews to
      find positive and negative comments, as well as side effect mentions, and then incorporates
      interaction information from <a href="https://www.drugs.com/">Drugs.com</a> and demographics
      information from the reviewers (this is optional), to assign a compatibility score to each
      medication for the patient or caregiver. The medications are then ranked, and summary
      information and graphics produced for output.</p>
    <h1>How does PsychedUp really work?</h1>
    <p>PsychedUp is a web application built in Python and deployed using the
      <a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">flask</a> module. Information from
      <a href="https://www.nami.org/">NAMI</a>,
      <a href="https://drugs.com/">Drugs.com</a>, and <a href="https://webmd.com/">WebMD</a> was
      scraped on January 18th, 2020, using
      <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">beautifulsoup</a>, and the data was
      processed using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>,
      <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>,
      <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">the Natural Language Toolkit</a>, and
      <a href="https://spacy.io/">spacy</a> to clean the data, perform a sentiment and bag of words
      analysis, and an expected value framework value was used to classify reviews as positive or
      negative for the user ("the compatibility score"). Graphics were developed using
      <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> and
      <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn</a>.
