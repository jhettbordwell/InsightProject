Just a totally different child. I thought Omg, why did I waite so long to take him in to be treated!! Then, gradually it got horrible! He started having what I called \"These Fit's\" He would get so upset at the drop of a dime.On the way to the psychologist one day, we were leavin well he wanted a cheese sandwich and we were out of bread.The only bread was end pieces. Well he went CRAZY! Kicking, screaming, hollaring, \"I hate you! I wish you were dead! Nobody likes me anymore!\" It was as if the exordist had entered my little angles body. We got to psych. and it was only once I told him, that he was able to settle him down(after a 2 hour drive there)and he also got him a cheese sandwich. I later found out from his pediatrician that this was a really bad side effect of the meds.Except for the mood swings, outburst the medicine was great. But we had to switch to Concerta 18mg. cause the mood swings got worst and worst. Now, he is my little angle again. That just goes to show you, it is trial and error. Some meds work better for some people than other's. Hang in there, cause somewhere down the line, one will work the best!!!\n",

      "I've been taking Adderall since I was in 3rd grade for treatment for my ADHD. I am now a junior in high school and still take it daily for school. When I started taking Adderall it was the 5mg IR before school every day. A very low dosage for an 8 year old but it did help. Since then I changed to 10 mg ER somewhere in later middle school when I was either 13 or 14. Just this year I increased to 20 mg ER before school with 10 mg IR after school in order to help focus on homework. The adderall has been invaluable for me in helping me focus both during school and out, as well as lowering my impulsivity since it gives me that second reaction time before I say something or do something I shouldn’t. The only side effect I’ve ever noticed is that I do have a decrease of appetite when on the pill and once it wears off I’m ravenously hungry. However, once on the medication for 5 days or so that symptom has gone away and I end up hungry again. Overall I would recommend it to anyone with ADD or ADHD.1\n",

We just had our last and final episode of the med...she totaly \"wigged out\"....worse than the previous hysteria...all about cleaning her room.  It took my husband and me 45 min to calm her down.  She was mentally and physically exhausted.  We were terrified by what we witnessed.  She's only been off the med since Sat., but so far she's feeling better.  I'm scard to try something else, afraid of what those side effects might be.  We also read about Adderall being taken off the Canadian market because of severe side effects, including death.

For one, if you forget to take your second dose when you're supposed to, you're going to notice...at least I did. Secondly, god-forbid I took my morning dose on an empty stomach; I'd feel really jittery and my mind would race at 100mph. Overall though, it did it's job. I ended up switching doctors at the VA (I'm a vet) and my new doc mentioned dexedrine. I was reluctant to try them, but he put on me on 2x10mg spansules in the morning and 2x10mg tabs in the afternoon. Here I am a year later a lot happier with the results. The onset is smoother, it's easier to eat on it and there are no ups-and-downs. I recommend looking into dexedrine for anyone who runs into these problems with adderall...Also, dexedrine is a lot cheaper than adderall. Generic 10mg IR tabs cost about $.27 each, while the 10mg spansules are 2.16each.1\n",

I became withdrawn, depressed, unable to carry a conversation with others, it became hard for me to sleep well, eat well, stay asleep, and so on. When I was younger I hated Focalin so much that I would spit it out before I left to catch me bus. Also, because it would ware off by the time I got home my parents never believed I was like a zombie. One day I decided to prove it and take it on a weekend so they could see. They were so concerned for me that they held a little intervention at the end of the day. At that intervention I told them that I took my Focalin and they didn't make me take it anymore. Around age 14 I decided I wanted to take it again. I hated Focalin more than anything else, however, my grades had slipped immensely and I needed help paying attention. After taking the Focalin for a month I was able to pass the classes I had been failing before. Now I'm getting straight A's. Still, after all of this, I find Focalin to be torture. An extremely effective form of torture. And now, I feel as though I NEED Focalin to function properly in society and be a better version of myself.

      "Taking Adderall XR with suboxone makes a pill cocktail. The high from those two drugs combined is a whole new ball game. First of all Docs know nothing but to see you on your appointment and then get rid of you. If they payed any attention they would know that a person with a history of drug or alcohol abuse should not take adderall or adderall xr. But then again they keep us coming back for business. So, would that make them a legal drug dealer. Yes, it would. I had a chemical dependency to perscription painkillers. I realized something was really bad when I was taking them just to be able to function from day to day. I sought help because things were all jacked up. If I could make a difference in someone's life just by writing this little piece then all the pain I caused myself and everyone around me, then I would have to say it was worth it. If you have a chemical dependency the first thing you do is decide weather or not you want to continue that way of life, which is extremely painful. Second, commit to yourself in getting well. You will need a really good support system to help you through it. With hard work and dedication to yourself you will succeed. If you follow those three rules you will get through it with out a dought. If I had to go through it again I would have gone to the psychiatrist to get on suboxone so I could wing myself through it. I was on suboxone for one year exactly. If I would have just listened to my brother and not got on the suboxone I would have gotten over the emotional withdrawl after about 5 to 7 days. The physical withdrawls(tiredness,unmotivated)would eventually pass around three to four weeks.

I told my doctor I no longer wanted to take it, and when he said that was okay my parents became very angry and suddenly decided he didn't know what he was talking about. I finally stopped taking it after six months. I have a lot of problems but I try to handle it as it comes. Talking to my doctor helps. But this medication was not for me. I had all the emotional side effects, but my parents were more concerned about what they considered my \"behavioral problems\". They wanted a zombie kid but I didn't want to be one, it made me want to die. I now live away from home and though I still have panic attacks now and again, and I still obviously get easily distracted, I understand myself and what I need better than they do. I do not recommend this drug for kids who are overly creative along with hyper, because it kills your creative abilities and turns you into someone else.

Worst side effect is the tingling in feet and hands but workable. Loss of appetite - so I force myself to munch on healthy snacks during day. DRINK LOTS OF WATER. Dry mouth and grinding teeth does happen. Overall 4.5 stars. 1\n",

      "I started taking meds for ADD when I was 7, I'm 23 now. I first started w/ ritilan and then to dexadrine and then to adderall and then to adderall xr when it came out. The majority of the yrs I was on adderall/adderall xr though. It helped me focus and get things done like it was supposed to but it made me not feel like myself. I was really quiet and reserved and just not myself when I would take it, so much that people would ask me if there was something wrong. I didn't realize that it made me feel that way so much until I graduated high school and stopped taking it all the time unless I needed it. I guess b/c I was constantly on it for so long that it didn't effect me as much, or it wasn;t as obvious til I stopped taking it.  I've taken it on and off when I needed it for 5yrs now until about 2 weeks ago I started on Focalin which seems to be working better.  In addition to lacking personality, adderall made me feel very depressed when I would come off of it.1\n",

      "Our 15 year old son began taking four months ago.  He also has a great deal of anxiety along with ADHD.  We have seen very good results as far as behavior.  He is doing better in school.  He says he feels a lot less anxious when taking it and the \"channels aren't changing in his brain\". We notice his interactions with us and others is much better when taking medication.  His impulse control is greatly reduced!  Our only concern is that he does experience a \"come down\" usually around 8PM (he usually takes about 7AM).  If we are home he does fine, but if he is out he sometimes gets very anxious and nervous for about an hour until it completely wears off.  However, the positive results far out weigh this occasional problem.  It is VERY expensive and there doesn't seem to be much help for middle class families who do have insurance coverage but not much for medications.  We have decided it is worth the cost, but definitely a sacrifice in the wallet!  Wonder about children who have families that don't have the option do, very sad.1\n",

Also before I started Adderall I almost always reacted before I thought, and said and did a lot things that I regretted later. Now I usually think out actions before I act, so I get in a less fights now. The only drawbacks to the medication are because it is extended release you HAVE to remember to take it early in the day or else you will be up like all night. Also  probably the only real side effect that bothers me is the apetite reduction. But I have found the best way to get around that is eat a good breakfast before you take it, and have some healthy snacks around the house for when the medicine wears off night so you can have something to eat.

      "60 year old male: Allows me to get along with wife, family, friends & strangers much better and more comfortably. My wife is glad it has been prescribed for me and is able to notice the change. Will start and complete projects. Even have learned to play Bridge, try that without being able to concentrate and focus. Prior to prescription I would procrastenate and/or not complete projects without a struggle. Retired early due to feeling overwhelmed by employment responsibilities.  Although most would say I have been a modest success, I always found it difficult to work, most routine daily activeties and just getting along.  Wish this medication had been prescribed for me many years sooner. My prescription: 20mg twice daily. I usually only take 10mg twice daily (sometimes full dosage if I have to be up late in a social setting - weddings, going out with friends, etc.) and I try to skip dose for two days in a row each week. This seems to allow the medication to work better when I take it and may prevent having to increase future dosages. Side effects minimal for me.  I still eat but sometimes not as much - no great weight loss, about 5-8 pounds. Will go to sleep but may wake up during the night but am also able to get up and get moving in the morning.  I am still able to take a short snooze in the afternoon, which I like to do. A great medication for me but I see others have not always had the same success. My suggestion, try a smaller dose a couple of times a day and take a break from it once in a while. Ask your MD.  Good Luck.  PS:  I had been prescribed Paxil for about 10 years. This was only moderately successful for me and I was glad when I stopped it, which did have a couple of withdrawl symptoms for me. Never would consider it again.  Should have tried Adderall from the start. 1\n",

I'm not sure if they last quite as long as the non-sublingual tablets, but they kick in much faster, usually only a few minutes.   I find the side effects vary from day to day,  occasional dizziness or unsteadiness, occasional mild hallucinations if I take more than 1mg at once, sometimes a really high sex drive, sometimes a really sad weird nostalgic feeling.
