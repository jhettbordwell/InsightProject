      "I have been on a low dose of venlafaxine for several years now, and feel great.  Rarely do I suffer from any anxiety or feel down like I did in the past. 0.7684\n",
      "I have been on various doses ranging from 37.5 to 150 per day. I found it made my range of emotions much narrower, but unfortunately it dulled the highs ... I found the higher dose was causing ED and some crazy dreams. Difficult to get off of. I am no longer taking it. -0.899\n",
      "It has helped my depression and anxiety, but at a cost. I have overwhelming nausea, dizziness, and headaches at least 2 days a week. I love what the drug has done for my mental health but my physical health, not so much. 0.6249\n",
      "I have been on effexor first at 75 mg now at 115 mg for over 15 years.  I dont feel any different as a person but have less if no anxiety or depression.  I have not had any of the side effects plus i drink white wine daily.  My sleep has been very good but you do have very vivid interesting dreams.  This drug changed and saved my life.  Many other members of my direct family have also benefited from use of this medication. 0.8323\n",
      "I am on 75mg xr efexor for 3 weeks and 2 days . I’m at my wits end whether to continue as I’ve having still very severe anxiety and a down feeling. Can anyone advise? -0.5222\n",
      "I began Effexor 150 mg for anxiety. After 2 years my anxiety is worse than ever. Effexor gives me the shakes, nausea, dizziness all of the stuff that triggers my anxiety itâ??s absolutely terrible. I get tremors in my sleep and terrifying nightmares. My sex drive is non existent. I canâ??t display emotion. I constantly feel like Iâ??m dreaming when wide awake. Effexor turned me into a zombie. Please do not take this drug itâ??s the worst decision Iâ??ve ever made.  -0.9388\n",
      " TRY ANYTHING BUT EFFEXOR! At first I thought this was helping my anxiety and depression but the side affects are AWFUL! I am about to lose my job because I have missed so much work related to the side effects! I have missed 8 days in 4 months.  I have nausea, vomiting, sweating,drowsiness,trouble sleeping,weird vivid dreams,and headaches, some are migraines. Would not have taken it if I had known the side effects! -0.9553\n",
      "18 years ago, when we had our third child, and soon after that, my Dad died. I experienced a prolonged period of depression. It begun with anxiety and all those 'lovely' attacks. I have been on Effexor for all that time. It works (only 75 mg for the past few years), but it concerns me that I have been on it for so long. My old brain (I'm now 58!) tells me if I've missed a daily dose with vivid, almost psychedelic dreams. Oh, and those really odd shocks to my physical self. Other than that, my sex drive is good, real good. I still drink and exercise a ton. You have to, right? I think this drug probably helped give me the wonderful life I am fortunate to be living.   0.7242\n",
      "When I was prescribed this medication I read the reviews and then got kinda nervous about taking it.  I decided to only take 1 x 37.5 mg per day. I was very nauseous the first 4 days.  Had a strange vacant feeling, kinda weak, stuck it out and most of the side effects went away.  The only bothersome one I have now is slight constipation.  Magnesium citrate and Metamucil are dealing with that.  I'm pretty sleepy after I take it in the am but coffee does the trick (and no longer turns me into a nervous wreck).  I am calmer, I can concentrate better, my sense of humor is back, I feel normal, like my old self.  I'm not anxious about silly things, but I'm also not a zombie.  My dr is fine with me sticking with the low dose.  I know this drug isn't for everyone, but it is working for me. 0.7069\n",
      "I've had anxiety, panic attacks and depression since I was a child. I have taken most SSRI meds, but Effexor XR 150mg has been the best by far. I rarely have panic attacks, and if I do, they are mild and controllable. My anxiety in general is low and I don't get depressed any more. I also don't have any side effects (only decreased appetite which isn't so bad!) I am able to perform a stressful, professional full time job without any problems. I intend to keep taking this forever. If it works, why try and stop it?! I have never been happier. -0.9521\n",
      "Sleepiness in the afternoon, low sex drive, a little less appetite and brain zaps when you miss the dose for day and half. -0.4019\n",
      "Specifically for anxiety mixed in with depression this has been a life saver. I was originally on a high dose then it went down to 150mg, then to 75mg and then to half of that, however, in the winter went back onto the 75mg dosage and have stayed on it ever since. When I was on 150mg or higher I couldn't even cry, I was very unemotional, but, at least at that time, I probably needed the high dosage. Happy with 75mg a day and also take Vitamin D with it since my test I am very low with regard to that.   0.591\n",
      "This drug worked great.  I started on 75mg and stepped up to 150mg. After a few months doctor increased dosage to 225mg because worrying and paranoia were returning.  225mg worked awesome on my symptoms. It was so good not laying awake in bed, worrying about everything, thinking every whisper I heard at work was about me and feeling my blood pressure and heart rate rise, from the constant state of heightened alert required from my job.(Jailer) I stayed on this dosage for about a year and finally realized the side effects were not decreasing. The inability to orgasm, unbelievably excessive sweating (I had to change t shirts 6 hours into my shift at work) And the dreams! They seemed to last all night long and were so detailed and vivid and they seemed to continue from one night to the next!  It was almost like living another life while I slept. It became intolerable once these dreams started morphing into nightmares in which i would talk, cry and scream in my sleep (so says my wife, but I don't believe the crying part) and wake up sweating. I started taking a small dosage of welbutrin for my inability to orgasm (which I had no problem with, but my wife did). It didn't work.  Anyway, I had to quit because of the side effects, but the results for the intended purpose were incredible.  I am currently weaning off effexor and trying something else. Oh yeah!  I almost forgot the 3 to 4 days between bowel movements which culminated into an incredibly painful,humongous stool, when I finally was able to defecate! I mean really, really painful, to the point you doubt it would come out!  Another little bonus from this drug. But,hey, it worked so well, I will return to it if I can't find something better. Good luck! 0.9427\n",
      "I've been on the 75mg dose for over a year. It took about 2 weeks to get over some of the mild side effects (felt a bit spacy and too alert at night) but since then I've felt wonderful. Feel like I've got my life back, can think clearly and just enjoy being with people and living in the moment. It's been such a life-changer I'm actually concerned about possibly needing to go off it for an extended period of time when I, hopefully, try to conceive. I went off effexor 2 months ago because my prescription ran out and didn't have any problems with coming off it. However, did have the same mild side effects for a few weeks when I went back on it.  0.9755\n",
      "First day i noticed that it took my sex drive away. By day five I could not get out of bed. Very weak, flu like pains in my muscles and joints. Slept for about eleven hours, and finally I was able to stumble out of bed with a headache and brain fog. Stopping this med NOW. Just didn't work well for me at all.   -0.8187\n",
      "If I miss 1 dose, within 12 hours of missing it, I feel physically awful!! I get shaky and nauseous. I cough terribly and get diarrhea. All of this after 12 hours. It's terrible. I am on a generic form, only 75mg. When I was on name brand Effexor, this did not happen. I could go 2 days minimum, without any symptoms. -0.9323\n",
      "Cut back from 300mg to 175mg as insurance will no longer cover 300mg dose. Anyone else experience drainage, and sore throat upon doing this? It's been 2 weeks today. Did not ween down to 175. Went to lower dose in one day. I really have have had no other issues, which has surprised me, as I was expecting much worse!\r\n",

      "After the first day, I woke up anxiety free and was able to get out of bed! After a few weeks I felt great and could return to my high stress job as a Flight for Life paramedic (a job I've loved doing for the last 15 years). The job takes a toll. I fly adults/kids hurt and dying every shift to trauma centers and ERs. I'm still going through medication dose adjustments. The two issues with the drug I have noticed are acne (cystic) breakouts on my face and a lack of a sex drive. Also, the healing time for breakouts, lacerations, and scratches seems prolonged. Neither is overwhelmingly bad but I'm hoping these issues will resolve. In the meantime I've been taking Spironolactone (an underused acne wonder drug) which helps. Before taking Effexor XR I had to sedate myself to leave the house. No way could I think of going to work without panic. This drug saved my sanity and career.  0.9607\n",

      "My PCP tapered me off Zoloft (100 mg) and onto Effexor XR (150 mg) over the course of a month due to lethargy, weight gain (couldn't lose it).  Effexor was supposed to give me \"more giddy up and go.\"  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So far after 5 weeks I have insomnia, crazy dreams, and had thoughts of death and very dark mood.  I went to urgent care and the provider has me taking 75 mg until my PCP is back from vacation next week.  After one day of 1/2 dose I have an unrelenting headache, agitation, and no appetite.  I feel insane.  This drug (like all drugs) is poison to my system.  I'm sure it's helpful for others, but it doesn't work for my body chemistry.  I was hopeful.  The side effects are scary.

I ran out of my pills a few days ago & thought no big deal.......I have missed 3-4 days & have dizziness, nausea, headaches, tired, anger, crying fits, and the list goes on. This is like coming off Heroin, I think. I accidentally smashed my thumb today, which is painful & swollen, but the head \"trip\" is worse than my initial throbbing thumb. That eases, but the head rages on....also had a nosebleed that wouldn't stop. After only 2 days of these symptoms, I went to the pharmacy & refilled my prescription. No insurance but used my credit card to buy it. I feel like a drug addict!! I won't have insurance for another 2 months (new job) & my husband still unemployed. I have felt fine taking this medicine but afraid of ever running out again. This is like Crack! The last 2 days I feel as though I could really hurt someone or myself & I don't ever have these feelings.  -0.9277\n",

However i will say that if i forget to take this in the morning in the afternoon i will feel awful!!!!! and if i forget to take it for a day i will begin to feel sick like I'm getting a cold or even nauseous and throw up.

Doctor's can prescribe lower dosage amounts, however, the jump from one dose to another may be too much of a shock to your system. For example, I jumped from the 150 mg I was taking to 75 mg, then started the bead counting to completely come off. That jump was pretty intense let me tell you!\r\n",

I no longer have to keep xanax as a back up as I have been symptom free for many months. The only side effect I have had is headaches. The one concern is going off the medication. There was a point I could not get my Effexor refilled and after 3 days of being off it I was extremely sick. But once I got back on the medication I felt better within 3 hours. So it is important to wean off the medication if the treatment is stopped. Over-all, this medication was a life saver.  -0.7923\n",

I was on only 75 mg but not willing to increase my dose!!! Also transitioning off the drug was NOT fun... pretty much two weeks of hell.

It has not helped as much as I had hoped with anger and frustration during stressful situations.

Overall, the benefits completely outweigh the negatives. Regarding all the negative reviews, I think that this drug works very well for very specific people - if you think it might work for you at least try it out (with assistance from your doctor, in case you need to ween yourself back off) because it has been a god send for me.  -0.1045\n",

One of the first things I noticed when starting it was the constant hot flashes and sweating. After 4 months I noticed my thoughts were foggy but as long as I really focused I could get by at work. I also had my blood pressure increas so much I had to star taking pills for that as well. I also have frequent migraines, weight gain and tiredness.

After a 12 hour anxiety attack I cut off my hair with a crayola brand scissors and went to the doctor the next day. I'm giving this information to characterize how extreme my anxiety attacks were getting. I didn't feel like I was in my own body anymore. I felt out of my mind, out of control. This had been happening since June 2011. I went to the doctor finally September 2012. I am now falling asleep when I want to fall asleep, I haven't had an anxiety attack and I don't feel anxious at all, and I feel like I can control my OCD habits. The last is still strugglesome but I believe that I can do it now. I have coherent thoughts. I tell myself \"just one thing at a time\" and I can do it.

I just wasn't happy with this med because I was \"dulled\" and did feel happy.  I wasn't anxious but then again I did seem to enjoy things either.  So now I am trying a new med.

      "I was prescribed Effexor XR after using Celexa for about 2 months (started great, but then could fall asleep at the drop of a hat). My doc tried me on Zoloft, which made keep forgetting things. Taking Effexor has made me feel like my old self.  I'm not as anxious, I don't cry about nothing, and I'm interested in things again.  I started taking it because of the stress of nursing school and issues with my spouse, everything just piled on.  I jokingly call it my \"I don't give a crap\" med. I'm able to turn things off and not get so wrapped up in little irritating things.  The bad part is trying to wean, I only take 37.5 mg daily, it's pretty low. Do it slowly because there are dizzy spells, nausea and \"brain zaps\", I'm sure it's the serotonin levels dropping.  I know many people don't care for it, but it's really changed my life, back to somewhat normal.   -0.693\n",
      "It is difficult to review this medication, because technically it has worked wonders for me, yet miss a dose, and it is absolutely debilitating.  I suffered from panic attacks for years and tried a variety of anti-depressants to treat them.  Most worked marginally well, and usually came with some unwanted side effects, particularly weight gain.  On Effexor, though, I feel like I've had my life returned to me, and there are practically zero side effects, provided you take it every day.  I am able to function so much better on a daily basis, and have been living a fuller life since starting this medication.  \r\n",

      "Now for the downside.  I once missed a single dose because my pharmacy ran out, and within 6 hours of my normal dose time, I started feeling the effects.  Within 12 hours, I was sweating, nauseated, jittery, confused, etc.  I could barely sleep that night, and when I did, I had horrible nightmares.  The next day, I awoke feeling nothing like myself.  Literally, I felt like a different person was in my body.  I was incredibly irritable and had the worst vertigo I've ever experienced.  It was all I could do to get to the pharmacy once they had more, and within a couple hours of taking my dose, I was nearly back to normal.  After that incident, I did a great deal of research on this drug, and found that my experience was not uncommon at all, yet neither doctors, nor the warnings on the medication, nor the advice on site like this list any of these problems as a possibility.  I think a lot more people would be very hesitant to start this medication knowing how crippling it would be to try and get off it.  As some other reviewers have said, if there is any other option available to you, even if it doesn't work perfectly, I would strongly advise using that instead of starting an Effexor regiment. God willing, I will never miss a dose again, and God help me if I ever need to stop. :( -0.863\n",

I did not experience the severe withdrawals that others on this forum have commented on. Any symptoms I had when quitting were extremely mild. I have suffered fom panic attacks and recurrent 'episodes' of severe anxiety since I was a teenager. While taking Effexor my panic and anxiety episodes are non existent. I currently take the drug 150 mg/day and am so thankful, I can get out of bed without all the pain I used to have, due to having panic attacks at night. And since returning to normal on the drug, it has helped me lose the weight I gained from being so anxious/depressed before I started the drug.

I went for a week without it and I got pretty nervous and on edge, I was tired, I was cranky and moody, but I was able to continue to work and take care of my son.

The attacks got much worse after a heart attack in 2015. Symptoms included loss of appetite, nausea, shaking, headache and even dental pain. I was in the hospital three times for these symptoms over the past 4 years with no resolution. I finally went to the hospital in November 2017. I suspected these issues were anxiety related and a doctor offered me a prescription for 75 mg of Effexor (started with 37.5 mg for the first week).  Symptoms subsided fairly quickly over the first week and I had a good Christmas. It’s been seven months now and I’m feeling great. All symptoms are gone. I’ve been eating good, sleeping, good and have been very active outside, biking and doing yard work (retired in 2014). Still on 75mg. No significant side affects other a mild reduction in sexual activity. It’s definitely been very effective for me. Hope it keeps up. -0.1316\n",
      "I'm 38 male. Been taking Ativan daily for over 10 years to treat panic attacks and anxiety. All of sudden one day started having extreme disturbing thoughts and the Ativan was barely helping anymore. Miserable for about 6 months with this new strange anxiety/panic with crazy horrible thoughts was really creating a lot of despair in my life. Luckily and by the grace of God I found a deacon of my church that steered me to a really good psychiatrist. He prescribed me effexor xr 37.5 mg 2x a day. Initially no relief but after about 2 weeks slowly but surely I began to feel normal and not having any disturbing thoughts. What a blessing to feel at peace again. Wasn't even feeling much need for the Ativan anymore. Before the new anxiety/crazy thoughts started i was averaging .5 of Ativan a day and feeling fine for the most part. Then after I started having disturbing thoughts all of sudden and out of the blue (was on a trip driving out of town when it began). Anyways, it was disturbing me so much that I was taking anywhere from 2mg to 3mg of Ativan a day just to get by and was still feeling miserable and feeling I was at my breaking point almost entirely from morning til night. And now for over a month i felt normal almost 100 percent of the time. Reduced my Ativan down to 1mg a day and sometimes don't even feel the need for it. I take 37.5 mg in the morning and at night and my goal is to get off the Ativan all together and only being on the effexor.

After lowering the dosage for the last 3 weeks, per my new doctor's instructions, I am now on my 4th day without it and agree with what I read about how difficult it is to stop taking this drug.  The brain spasms or zaps, disorientation, dizziness, nausea, headaches, sleepiness and generally not being able to function has been almost unbearable.  Thankfully, I have been off work for 4 days because I definitely would not be able to function at work.  All this after only about 5 months on this drug.  What really upsets me is that the doctor that prescribed this to me did not mention how bad the withdrawal symptoms would be when getting off of it. I have even read that some of the symptoms may be permanent for people that have taken this drug for an extended amount of time.  I am so glad at this point that I developed the rash and constipation so I was not on it for any longer.

So instead of living a miserable life I decided to manage my anxiety, eat healthy, and exercise. Getting on a medication like this is forever so make sure you know that before going on.

Finally after 2 years and a dr who I felt would not help me get off this medication I was able to quit cold turkey from the lowest does. It was awful. I was sick for a week straight before I learned that benadryl relaxed everything so the brain 'zaps' would disappear as long as I took it.

I would describe the sleepiness as almost like narcalepsy.  I lost energy and had little desire to do anything.  Finally, I \"forgot\" to take a dose.  I had terrible nightmares that night and difficulty staying asleep.  I had even more significant headaches the next day, horrible dizziness - it felt like I was withdrawing from cocaine or something.  That was enough.  I just stopped taking it.  After a few days, I feel normal again with a significant increase in energy.  My advice:  stay away from these drugs!  Don't get hooked!  You should find out what triggers the anxiety/panic attacks and increase physical activity.  Eat better and learn to relax! -0.5126\n",
      "I have been taking Effexor for a couple weeks now and I could not be more pleased with the medication. Please be aware that these types of medicines impact each person differently! My experience has been amazing. I used to be very nervous and anxious and overwhelmed easily and having panic attacks regularly. I was slightly depressed as well. Since taking the medication my nervousness and anxiousness has gone from a level 8 to about a level 2. I feel like I have a ton of energy when I wake up, I am ready to go as soon as I open my eyes. The side effects that I have noticed are some tremors and also loss of appetite. This medicine has changed my life.  -0.6851\n",

      "My 17 year old daughter has been on this medication for 4 months now and has adjusted well.  Had some side effects to begin with including disturb sleep, dizziness.  We had a chat about how she was feeling this afternoon and the weight gain is starting to worry her.  She has put on about 8 kilos in 4 months.  I noticed her appetite increased.  She is adjusting her diet and increasing her exercise which is easier in warmer weather, but we had not read about this side effect.  Has anyone else notice this weight gain.  I am aware that many antidepressant cause weight gains.  Have I just missed the information or is this a more unusual side effect. 0.8462\n",
      "Effexor (Venlafaxin) was prescribed to control my anxiety/depression due to constant neck/back pain (three surgeries later).  I didn't want to take an anxiety drug, and effexor really didn't help until I reached the minimal clinical dose of 150 mg/day.  Had to take Extended time release; immediate release made me sick to my stomach.  For me, this med has been VERY effective in restoring chemical/good hormone imbalance caused by my constant pain.  I do notice that missing a dose (once daily) I become more irritable, but get back to \"normal\" shortly after taking pill.  The benefits of this med OUTWEIGH the RISKS.  If your doctor didn't walk you through the side effects, get a different doctor.  Ultimately it's your body, your decision.  This med correct a chemical imbalance in your brain, so you are naive to think you won't experience problems if you just stop taking this med.\r\n",

I won't say I can't cry but it is a rare occurance... as opposed to being something I would have found myself doing often, and with little reason. I am much happier and less \"unreasonable\" now that I am taking Effexor regularly. I am 60 years old and now only use 37.5m daily. Going without the medication is still not an option for me.

      "I was prescribed Effexor X-R to treat anxiety. I had hurted myself at work and I couldn't sleep and was feeling anxious. I expressed my concern about taking that type of drugs but was reassured by my doctor that they were not addictive and as soon as I wanted to stop taking them all would be fine. The first first time I tried to stop I could not get out of bed. I was feeling so ill I had to call in sick at work. I spent two days like this. I went back to see him and explained what happened and was told that after a couple days I would be fine. Wrong!! I kept taking the tablets because I could not handle feeling so sick. Even after all this still I was not told that I needed to come off them slowly . When I went back to see him, he was away so I had to see another Dr who gave me a lower dose and explained that I needed to take the lower dose for a while before I could come off them completely. I did this for 2 months and then decided that it was time to stop. Had enough. If I had known what was to come I would have never ,ever listened to my doctor and trusted him. It has been over two months now and I'm still having withdrawal symptoms. The nausea, light headed, heart racing,finding it difficult to concentrate, lack of libido, sudden feelings of sadness or anger, sweating even when it's cold, nightmares, just to name a few.

I was yelling constantly at my children and would have fits of crying. Both my parents suffered from anxiety.  I went on this and a rescue medication. After 3 months I was able to get off the rescue med and continue on this.  I have not had any more panic attacks, or chest pain. I am more patient with my children and my husband loves that I dont get upset at little things like I used to. I am more mellow. The only down side was that it made me sleepy. That diminished after about 3 months.  I keep my pills in a pill strip so that I remember to take on every day. When I forget it gives me horrid headaches.  I know there is a generic now, but I am sticking with the name brand. If you go to the effexor website you can get a card which gives you up to 75.00 off your copay. My insurance charges me over 85.00 a month now because there is a generic, but with the copay card I pay just 10.00 a month.

Had to discontinue after learning of pregnancy...horrible side effects that lasted 3 weeks: electric shocks orginating from brain to core of body, dizzyness, and mood swings out of control.

      "I wanted to tell other people that I think there is a way to get off this drug. I'll tell you what I am doing that seems to lessen the withdrawal effect. First get a notepad because you are going to want to write everything down because you will be decreasing your dosages. Your effexor XR capsule will have little white beads inside of it. Depending on your dosage, that is how many beads are in it. My dose is 75 mg, so I have 75 little white beads in it. Step 2 is to get a small dark colored bowl and a pencil. Next wiggle \"cap\" off the capsule. This is the shorter end of the capsule. Once you have it off then set it to the side. Now you will see that there are the tiny little white beads inside. Do not dump the entire content of beads into the dark colored bowl! (I use the dark colored bowl since it's easier to spot and count the beads). Now while holding the capsule, tip it slightly to loosen the beads up and grab your pencil. With the pencil tip, easily scrape the beads out one at a time if you can. Always check your bowl and COUNT the white beads because you need to be exact. EVERY DAY YOU WILL REDUCE YOUR DOSAGE BY 5 WHITE BEADS! DON'T REDUCE BY ANYMORE THAN THAT OR YOU WILL DEFINITELY EXPERIENCE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS! Once you remove 5 beads from the capsule, screw the top \"cap\" on snug. You will have to wiggle it back on. Discard the beads preferably in an old medicine bottle with a child-proof cap. Take the capsule with at least a bottle of water to wash down and WITH food. Do not take with juice because I heard it can increase the effects of medications. So far I have reduced by Effexor dosage from 75 mg to 40mg with no side effects. I am really starting to feel like I am getting my personality back! Plus I have dropped a few pounds since my body is feeling alive again. I recommend this method to anyone wanting to get off this Effexor nightmare.

When I felt that I didn't need anything anymore the Doctor had me wean off and low and behold the  withdrawal symptoms that you read about for this drug were horrible... for two and 1/2 weeks I was nauseous and dizzy with vertigo symptoms non stop and lost weight. After the withdrawal wore away is when I felt that I needed something yet to help control my anxiety. I am now on the 3rd drug and am almost ready to tell my doctor that I'd rather be back on Effexor XR again. Only one other downfall other than the withdrawal symptoms is it causes low libido. We have to work on that one. 0.2263\n",
      "I experienced HORRIBLE anxiety after my first child was born, to the point that I could not sleep or care for my baby.  I hated life and asked my husband if we could give our child up for adoption.  I knew something was seriously wrong, so I went to the doctor.  They put me on Zoloft, but it didn't work and I didn't have several weeks to wait and see if it would work.  I went back to the doctor, and they put me on Effexor XR.  It started working within a few days and significantly increased the quality of my life.  I could take care of my baby again and began sleeping better and enjoying life again.  The only side effect I noticed was strange dreams, but that was a small price to pay for feeling human again.  I was on it for about a year and decided to wean off it after finding out that I am pregnant again.  I was on a dose of 75mg/day, and it took me about two and a half weeks to wean off Effexor completely.  The only side effect of weaning off was that my head felt \"floaty\" - I joked with my husband that I felt like a bobblehead.  I am starting to feel more anxiety again and may go back on it if it is safe to use during pregnancy.  I know Effexor is not for everyone, but it truly has been a miracle drug for me. 0.9658\n",

The other two side effects I have are that it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy sex or orgasm anymore and some nights I wake (3-5 am) and have HORRIBLE episodes of anxiety to the point of a panic attack much worse than before I started taking the Effexor.  I thought this medication was \"constant\". Is there a \"low time\" with this medication?? No one else has commented on this in any other post so maybe it's just me? I am very worried about increasing or weaning from this medication per all the reviews here but I am SO COMPLETELY HAPPY during the day without all the looping crazy thoughts in the back of my mind that have plagued my life prior to the Effexor XR. Lastly, I also take Adderall for ADD, I am glad I talked to the Pharmacist before starting the Effexor, he told me that I needed to space the two medications a minimum of 2 hours apart every morning or I would not be happy with the side effects. -0.8818\n",

The tingling in my face and head and hands and then sever panic attack that i can't breath and i know that i am fine but the withdrawls are horrible i don't recommend taking this medication unless nessary because it is very difficult to come off of it.

I was originally on 150mg per day and then reduced to 75mg (not without problems). Thereafter managed to reduce to 37.5 mg twice per day and then one 37.5mg per day. Each time I reduced I experienced withdrawal.  I recently stopped taking Effexor, on the advice of a Consultant. The withdrawal symptoms are terrible. I have electric shock like feelings in my head which travel down my arms whenever i move my eyes from side to side, extremely sensitive to sound, shaking, nausea, disorientation, vertigo, either insomnia or extreme sleepiness, nightmares, weakness, flu like symptoms. I have now reached day 6 off Effexor and no sign of the  withdrawal abating.  I am now seeking the help of a counsellor to assist me in coping with not only the withdrawal but the terrible mood swings.

ME: I am a forty-something male, married, two sporty kids.  Profession requires public speaking and frequent client interaction.  I was a professsional athlete and continue to work out almost every day.  PROBLEM: I've always been extremely anxious around people, although few people knew it.  It was a constant struggle being around people other than those I knew really well.  I was also nervous talking to important clients or making important presentations, but, again hid it.  The reality, though, was I was not enjoying myself, avoided all such situations, and therefore didn't excel at many things I did, despite the fact that I am a very smart, witty and caring person (don't mean to sound vain - just saying I've always had the tools to be an extremely successful person, but my anxiety/depression squelched everything).  My anxiety occassionally elevated to full blown panic attacks where it was obvious to the people I was with that I was nervous.  I know now that I was experiencing related depression as well. At times I would get into a complete funk, tired and exhausted, despite the fact I was getting lots of sleep.   I would be in a fog.

      "I began taking effexor xr 37.5 mg about 4 years ago. I had started taking prozac about 6 months after my daughter was born, stayed on that about 1 year but experienced weight gain, stayed sleepy. went off that about a year, then started having anxiety again, crying at the drop of a hat. My doc recommended effexor.  I asked to stay on lowest possible dose, and have really liked this mecication.  the only side effects I noticed when I 1st started were extreme \"energy\" esp. when I 1st woke up, and some trouble sleeping, but I was already having trouble with that. That subsided quickly enough, the only other thing that was significant was headaches, but I can't say for sure that it was from med.  They have stopped too. I feel effexor has allowed me to be the person I'm meant to be.  I feel very happy and \"normal\" again, even better that ever.  The few side effects I have/had were not enough for me to stop taking it.  A co-worker quit her effexor cold turkey and told me \" you've got to get off that stuff\" story similar to other posts here.  My take is--don't stop any meds like that cold turkey, that's just dumb.  And everyone is different, but I would stay on as low a dose as possible, I think It makes it easier if you do decide to stop.  I wish I didn't have to take anything, but since I do, I like this med.  With prozac I felt sluggish, and was ravenous all the time, but not with this.  I feel very energetic most of the time, and don't worry like I used to.  But there are alot of meds out there, try something different if one doesn't do it for you. 0.7707\n",

A few years in I decided this wasnt something that I wanted to take forever, especially since my MD warned me it wasnt for long term use and it should have changed my chemistry.  I weaned myself off, which I expected to be painful based on others experiences, and it was.  That wasnt the worst part though.  After withdrawal ended I was left feeling like I had no brain.  Years later I still feel the same way.  I have no memory, I'm always at a loss for words, and I can't begin to articulate my thoughts.  Effexor changed my life for the good for a very small amount of time, but the damage it has done has been much much worse.  I can only hope its not permanent.  Be very careful when taking this drug.

It can be done with minimal impact to your life if you have the right mindset and determination to do it.

It's been 1 year now And I'm down to 1/2 of a 37.5  pill a week,down from 225 a day. If I had of known that this loss of controll of my own life  is what it would have done to  me I would have put this effort into finding a support group or some other form of non drug related help.

Its been 8 days without the drug and I still have a hard time concentrating, I can't move quickly or I'll become nauseous, I dry heave in the morning or sometimes randomly, I am SO FREAKIN HOT and I can't cool down, I sleep all day (even at work - thank goodness for a wellness room), I've got muscle spasms, \"brain zaps\" where its like the world does a shuffle inside my skull...DO NOT GO ON THIS DRUG UNLESS YOU HAVE SERIOUSLY DEEP, DEEP DEPRESSION. There are much better options out there. I have been on 6 other medications, this one working the best for \"moods\" but I had no libido and was more or less numb for the entire time and the withdrawal is not even remotely worth it. It almost negates anything good Effexor ever did for me. If given a choice, I'd go back to Wellbutrin. That said, I've opted out of the antidepressant route all together and am going to a Naturopath and dealing with my issues through CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). \r\n",

      "I have always had the normal bouts with anxiety but around 6 months ago, while I was away on a conference trip, I began having anxiety attacks (excelerated heatbeat, feeling of something bad was going to happen if I drive over the bridge). Then when I got home, the anxiety got worse.  I felt like I was losing my mind, totally unlike myself. I decided I needed to see my doctor immediately because I knew something was not right.  He gave me Effexor-I started on 37.5 dose for 10 days, then increased to 75mg a day.  The first time I took it, I felt this overwhelming sensation of cool happiness and I knew it was going to help me.  My anxiety didn't completely go away but it has made a huge difference in how I felt during that time.  My doctor said he can increase the dosage but I didn't want to for fear of being overly medicated and too dependent on it.  Now that I have been on it for 6 months, I feel okay to increase it, if need be.  I am a little apprehensive of what type of withdrawal side effects I will feel, but I am confident in my doctor and will follow his instructions to decrease my dosage slowly.  I know everybody has their own experience with this medication, but I wanted to share mine in hope's that it will help someone feel okay about taking it.  I had not intended to write this review but I read the guy's experience who wrote on 5/30/09 @ 3:21pm and it touched me.  So I hope this will help someone.

It did take some time to work & some days I am \"moody\" but I chalk that up to the normalacy of life. I get along better with everyone, can drive, be in groups & deal with stressors better than I remember.

I have also taken the new Pristiq, it helps but less for GAD.(even though they are basically the same thing-and metabolize differently. The best way to get off the effexor xr is reduce your dose to 37.5 and take 5mg or 10mg prozac. After 1 week discontinue the effexor and continue to take the prozac for 3 to 4 weeks. This should help minimize the withdrawls, everyone is different so you can tweek it to your needs.

I didn't have a problem with the withdrawl symptoms while transitioning until now.  I'm dizzy, my brain feels like its swimming, and my sleep schedule just depends on the day  (sometimes I can sleep sometimes I can't).  Being a nurse I realize that taking medication that alter mood and all that will have withdrawl symptoms but I NEVER realized that anything could be this bad.  The medication worked and served its purpose (without side effects) while taking it but I suggest talking to your doctor about what happens down the road when you try to get off.  Unfortunatley you never know how your body will react until that time comes but maybe there are other medications out there that are easier to transition off of without feeling like a zombie!

The beginning was hard because of the side effects, (couldn't sleep, felt sick to my stomach, jaw clinching) I started out at 37.5mg, but after about 7-10 days moved to 75mg. As soon as I started the 75mg dose, I lost complete desire for sex and could not have an orgasm. That was it for me. I then decided to ween myself off of it. Again, read many bad things about going off the drug. I fortunately didn't have too many problems. I decreased my dose to 37.5 mg for a week from the 75 and experienced a little clinching of the jaw and maybe a little light-headedness. I'm now 4 days off completely. The only thing I notice is I'm having trouble sleeping at night. I am sure this will wear off soon. The good thing, my sexual desire is back. So overall the dug may have been fine if it didn't have the sexual side effect, and the weening off was fine as well. I may not have had any problems because I was on a low dose and only on the drug for a month. It's worth a try if you are wondering if it'll work for you.

If you are considering this drug, PLEASE think twice and talk to your doctor about other treatment options. I hope to ween myself off soon, but I'll need lots of help, this is a VERY powerful drug. 0.4047\n",
      "I have been on 75mg of Effexor XR for about 5 years for GAD and depression.  This is the BEST drug for treating these conditions.  I have been able to repair relationships with my family and make new friends that I never would have made or kept with my anxiety/depressive symptoms.  I wish I had found it sooner and not wasted years... 0.8645\n",
      "Worked great for GAD. Some visual problems. I feel so good now after 15 months on 75mg. I am beginning to wonder if I need it anymore. From the sounds of these people, it is not an easy thing to stop. I will ask my doctor. 0.2469\n",
      "I have been taking Effexor for 3 yrs for anxiety. I started at 75m and made my way to 225. I found that I actually became tolerant to Effexor. This visit, the doctor put me on Buspar also with the Effexor, with the intention of discontinuing the Effexor. \r\n",
      " I have to say, I have actually weaned myself back to 150. The Buspar seems to quell my anxiety and I feel great. I am peaceful and calm for the first time in years. 3 months now! \r\n",

      "I have been taking Effexor XR for 3 months now.  I have taken Cymbalta and Buspar and neither of them have worked as well as this.  I think everyone is different and you should listen to your dr. when he/she prescribes something.  Maybe this isn't right for everyone.  I take 37.5 mg a day.  My dr. said that I could easily go to 75 mg a day, since that is the usual dose but I feel like this works for me.  At least for now.  I still have minor anxiety but nothing like I had before.  I have missed a dose now and then and when I do my biggest complaint is nightmares.  I realize when I decide to stop taking Effexor that I will experience awful side effects, but I think all medications have this.  When I went off of Cymbalta (took it for 6 months) I had brain zaps, dizziness, and other terrible symptoms that took a few months to get through.  But I did get through it.  This works for me now and I will continue to use it as long as I feel the need.  If your dr. recommends it, try it to see if it right for you. -0.8176\n",
      "This medication was the best thing for my anxiety & panic disorder, I have tried a few others but this was by far the best. The only side effects I had were falling down, falling asleep spontaneously and bleeding (like i was on a blood thinner). But when I could no longer afford the medication I went through the worst withdraw symptoms and pain I had ever been through in my life, it took me almost 2 months to completly get over the nausea and headaches (I had them everyday). I literally could not get the strength to get out of bed to take care of my children, if I did I was dizzy and out of sorts. It felt like I had a hang over everyday, it was horrible! I was only on this medication for a total of 5 months and need to get back on some type of anxiety/panic medication. -0.9317\n",

      "I started taking this medicine in 1999 and had no side effects ever. I got off of it in 2005 and was fine after weaning off for just a week from 75 mg to 35mg to nothing. Then I got pregnant and had my daughter in 2007 and I was fine for like three months, then started to have anxiety. I went back on effexor. I started with 150 mg then went to 75 4 months later. I did fine ecxept I was tired alot. Then about six months after that, only being on it less then a year, I tried to get off it. I took 35mg for 2 weeks and was fine. Then boom, it just hit me. This medicine is a nightmare to get off of. I had severe nausea, brain zaps, dizziness,crying,fear.etc. I just tried to get off it again in Nov 2008 with no sucess. Sme thing happened. I dont know why I was ok getting off it in 2005 but not now. Why is it different? It has helped me alot with anxiety, but it is horrible to get off. The withdrawls are unbearable. I would not recommend this medicine to anyone!!! -0.8931\n",
      "This is a follow up to my 11/25/2008 1:57:57PM coments (read it first if you haven't already). I've just finished my second month of withdrawl down from 75mg to 0 mg of effexor. The last 4 or 5 days have turned out to be worse than any other. A lot of back and forth feelings of neverousness and calmness (it's more like my nerves are becoming more active, in a very unconfortable way, and directly reacting to the change in my body chemistry (Effexor withdrawl?). These nerveous reactions  do not seem to be related to my state of mind or thought process they just change directions at ramdom. There are periods when my nervious system calms down and I feel just fine. I have to admit the last few days (not counting today) I all most gave up, I believe the Effexor web site said it takes up to 3 months to clear out of your system so I plan to ride out the whole 3 months and decide then.\r\n",
      "On one hand if I go back on the effexor I face nite terrors (screaming in my sleep, diving out of bed, waking up with bumps and bruses and having little or no memory of the event)(my wife and kids tell me about it in the morning) (my wife sleeps in a different bed room so she avoids any injury). On effexor, I have no memory of having any normal dreams. To be honest I love having  normal dreams (not nightmares) over the past two months, since I've been off effexor. I'm done for now and need to take a break.       0.9596\n",

I have dizziness really bad and just don't feel right the times of i've tried. I feel depressed but dare not up the dosage any higher then 75mg. I would have to take off work to come off of this drug. I have a hard time becoming sexually aroused and thats when i'm lucky enough to feel like sex. Bottom line, it took care of one thing but brought on new issues. I wish I could go away for about 3 months and get off of this stuff to see who i am again.  0.0671\n",

      "I started at 350mg after the intial month of side effects it worked well for Anxiety, but made sleeping difficult and dreams or at least remembering dreams became nonexistent. I lost all ability to have a spontaneous erection and performance on command was extremely difficult. About 1 year ago I successfully attempted to decrease my dose down to 75 mg over several months with little side effects, my sexuall function improved as I decreased the dose. When I tried to advance from 75mg down to 37.5mg I felt a mild form of intermitant Anxiety, started to have/remember  nightmarish dreams and desided to regroup at 75mg for several more months. At the begining of November 08 I decided to go from 75mg to 0. After a nite or two I started to have/remember my dreams and still do after about 30 days no nightmares that I can recall and I 've had my first natural spontaneous erection since starting effexor 5 years ago. The down sides: the first 8 to 10 days I was extremely emotional I mean I cried at sad car tunes, movies it was embarrassing but that went away after 10 days: I also had unusual sounds in my head (kinda hard to describe WHAAA Whaaa?)that disapeared after 10 days also. The last few days (27th to 29th I've started to have(unprompted by any events) intermittent,very mild anxiety, alternating with spells of peace and calm and last for several minuntes each and then disapate.

If/when I run out I will be forced to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. I don't like to be \"stuck\" on a drug, but I am glad that I found something that works with minimal side effects.

I have ran out before and 2 two days later, my lips were numb, my brain was pausing, and I felt like I was outside of myself.

Anybody have any ideas as to what I can do about the Dr. who also let me go, (the one that gave me the scrip)who said she can't help me since my coverage was cancelled.

Scarier though are the emotional and cognitive symptoms.I would feel like a stranger in my own body, in my own house and even in my own life. I never did drugs - but all the symptoms I have on Effexor are very close to what I imagine someone feels when stoned. BUT THE WORST IS I STARTED DRINKING - AND I NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD THIS PROBLEM. I FELT IN MY GUT THAT I AM NOT AN ALCOHOLIC, BUT COULDN'T EXPLAIN BEYOND THIS. AND I STARTED SMOKING AGAIN, ALTHOUGH I QUITTED 9 YR AGO.

I am a very social person, but Effexor made me dread going anywhere. It helped me with anxiety but it made me not care about anything. I was completely emotionless.

      "It took several weeks before I noticed a change in my anxiety level.  I am still having problems with stress.  This drug seems to have helped with hot flashes.  I was previously on zoloft which I think helped with the anxiety better, but it made me sweat all the time which was embarassing. -0.3612\n",
      "When I first began Effexor XR 37.5 dose I was sick and unable to sleep but I noticed that I was improving emotionally. Then I progressed to the 75 dose I began experiencing fatigue and headaches; but I was beginning to feel more at ease and had better concentration and I was ready for the 150 dose, according go my doctor. When on the  150 dose I was at times experiencing extreme fatigue and weight gain, along with headaches and chronic constipation. However, I was extremely happy with the results in the beginning. I had self confidence that I never had before and was convinced that I would use this drug forever. I was calm and level headed and for once liked myself. Over a period of time I noticed my growing dependence on this drug. My weight gain was out of control and I bruised very easily. My self confidence turned into aggression that raged out of control. My family would not accompany me anywhere during this time because my temper was out of control and I would 'mouth off' to anyone who looked at me wrong. Then the dizzy spells started to occur and nightmares started. It has been a long road to hell and back trying to get off this drug. I will succeed in getting my life and family back. I'm now at the 75 dose again and my body is craving more Effexor - it's unreal. Next week I'll try to cut the dose to 37.5 but I am afraid because of all the hell I'm going through to get off these pills. Effexor XR will make a 'junkie' out of you - just because it's legal doesn't make it any better than the illegal street drugs. The symptoms are the same and it can eventually ruin your life. 0.9331\n",
      "I have suffered from anxiety attacks and severe migraines since I was a child. I realized I needed to be treated for depression when I was in my early 30's. I finally went to a doctor and asked for help. After trying some different medications and dosages we finally decided on Wellbutrin XL 450mg with Effexor XR 225mg. I've been on this for about 2 years. IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID! My anxiety and anger was gone after a few weeks. I stopped fighting with my husband and co-workers everyday. I was able to take difficult situations in stride. The worst side effect was dry mouth. I will say that after reading some of these reviews I'm terrified to ever go off of the Effexor XR. -0.9755\n",

I just wanted to share, to let you all know there is an end to the agonizing withdrawal symptoms, you just have to tough it out.

I have NEVER had a \"weight\" problem...so this is very new and difficult for me--its a puffy, bloated look..very noticable in photos.  I am coming off of it as I type this.  I need it, but will consult dr. for something else.  Funny thing is, I read in the article on this site that Effexor  was one that didn't cause weight gain...NOT TRUE.

For the first time in a long time, I don't obsess over food, feel like I'm starving even though I just ate or only feel satisfied eating high carb things.  I sleep better and wake up refreshed.  I've never felt so normal and productive in my life!  I'm drinking more water, I'm more motivated which means more active and in 2 weeks, I've lost 7 pounds without much effort or depriving myself. I've read all the horror stories on the net and just thought this medicine needed some positive feedback.  Just because it gave you some horrible side effects doesn't mean it's bad.  It just means its not for you.  Please don't use scare tactics to keep someone from trying it as it could change their life they way it has mine.

I have been having the worst withdrawals!! I started to take it every other day and would feel constantly slightly dizzy throughout the day. But I pushed through it and it is now IMPOSSIBLE to try and take it every three days. My body is physically addicted to this medication! I can not explain how awful the withdrawl symptoms are. My head feels fuzzy along with my vision, I have awful headaches and feel so dizzy it makes me extremely nauseous.

I began Effexor XR at the lowest dosage, then increased to 75. Used that dosage for a year. Just recently increased to 150. The reason I tried the increase was because of anxiety. At 75, it helped with most of my depression symptoms. However, I still needed to sometimes take Ativan for anxiety attacks. At 150, Effexor seems to be helping with my anxiety problems as well.

These \"jolts\" in my brain make me feel awful, which naturally alters my mood because there is NOTHING that can be done to take this away! Not to mention that after I started taking Effexor XR several years ago, it decreased my sex drive; resulting in difficulty having an orgasm (something I did not have a problem with before taking Effexor)!  I have no desire for sex, even though I find my husband so very sexy! Additionally, I struggle with constipation; have abnormal dreams; weight loss was great (at the beginning) but not withstanding; my cholesterol and blood pressure have been up and down like my weight; and I forget a lot details and dates (something that is not conducive to my family or profession). There are times I feel like in my effort to try to minimize my anxiety, I developed something much worse—an Effexor XR addiction!  If you plan to stop taking Effexor XR abruptly, I strongly urge you to consider the side affects (withdrawal symptoms) with your doctor.

Unlike most of these reviewers, I take it at night, because it makes me sleepy (it has really helped me sleep well, actually).  I am weaning off the Klonopin now, because the XR has been really effective.

I tried Zoloft and Celexa before being put on this and neither had the effect the effexor has. To those who have been on depression anxiety medication that hasn't help, ask your Dr. to switch you, it's worth trying more than one kind.  It's been a godsend for me. 0.5902\n",

I don't know if that is from the Effexor or not. -0.9127\n",

I suffered a back injury that has rendered my extremely limited in my mobility causing weight gain. The effexor has been wonderful. Not only am I sharp, alert and focused, I am happy, upbeat and energetic. Initially I had trouble sleeping and felt strange the 1st 2 weeks but I can't imagine going back to who I was before this med. I do get minor headaches if I don't tkate my dose when scheduled. It helps to take it spread out during the most actice portion of your day as to not hinder sleep and take advantage of the alertness. Love it!    0.9337\n",

It's worked incredibly well to get me over my anxiety (I had to leave public school then but recently graduated from college in a different city).    Now I'm having panic attacks and mild bouts of depression again and found out it's not good to be on it if you're under 18.  I started taking it when I was 15 and am now 20 so I'm having to re-evaluate everything and find out what's happening.\r\n",

This is probably my only problem. This is a physically addictive drug so OBVIOUSLY DONT MISS A DOSE! You will feel side effects.

My side effects have been constipation and trouble sleeping, but those have somewhat subsided and I am feeling much better now.  Before the small things would upset me and I would be very anxious and upset.  Now I feel like I am more on an even keel and don't get upset and anxious anymore.  For me, Effexor has been very helpful as there has been much stress in my life the past couple of years and now I feel like I can cope with what life throws at me.  I recommend it. -0.6643\n",

I was taking as much as 112.5 mg/day and am back down to 75 mg/day and will be moving down to 37.5 mg/day in the near future.  Even though I my dosage is decreasing, the side effects do not change.  The weight gain only started happening when I increased my dose to 112.5 in November, but continues to climb even though I am on a lower dose.  It seems odd that a drug that is supposed to help with \"depression\" would cause weight gain, which in itself could be depressing.  Needless to say, I can't wait to get off this drug. 0.0387\n",

Crying fits, anxious thoughts and severe nausea. However, my anxiety comes back so severe that it allows me to see that Effexor is controlling my anxiety. I have not gained weight or lost my sex drive while on this medication.  -0.967\n",
      "This medicine is Awful.  Been using about 7 months and suddenly I have been itching all over.  Made my blood pressure go up, so now I am on 3 different meds instead of 2.  Someone should be shot for making such a med.  My research shows that itching is a common side effect of this med. AND they say that it is not addicting, well explain to me why I have to be tapered off slowly.  I was taking 225 mg per day and for the last couple day down to 150mg.  Nausea, dizzy, etc. They also had me on Risperdal at bedtime, so I am going through withdrawals from that also.  If I ever get off this med.....no more for me.  Doctors should take it for a few months and then try to go off to experience the side affects.  I have had BAD headaches every since I started this stupid med.  I just pray to God that I can get off this med and stay off.  If you are going through similar side effects, I feel for you and understand.  Oh, by the way, I was on .25 of risperdal and they took me off cold turkey.  How can the FDA approve such mean drugs?!?!  I hope if you are trying to decide whether to take this drug or not, you do some serious research before deciding unlike me.  Now I am among the thousands of others who are trying to get off this and have a normal life.  Friends say \"quit scratching\" but you cannot quit.  I am taking benadryl to try to help with the itching.  Search effexor and itching on the net and see what you find.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!

I was first put on Lexapro, and it made me feel like I was crawling in my skin, and then they gave me Effexor XR, and it took about 2 1/2 weeks to really notice a change,and of course,because I was feeling so good, I didnt notice, but my husband did, and commented on how upbeat and how I wasnt so, uptight and nervous, and stressed. The only real side effect I have noticed is hot sweats randomly thruout the day, and a small lack of sex drive. -0.6426\n",

      "I already wrote a positive review of this drug, but after reading other reviews I thought I should add something about the withdrawal symptoms. With Effexor, it is VERY IMPORTANT to continue taking the medication. The withdrawal is terrible!!! One a few occasions for one reason or another I've found myself without my pills for a few days and it was awful. The withdrawal symptoms start within 48 hours and it's so hard to describe. To borrow from another reviewer...It's like your life is a slow motion movie. I start to get a little paranoid and VERY panicky. I am a little nervous about ever going off this medicine because of that. When I go off my pills, I feel completely out of it. Just remember that when starting treatment - this is not a drug to be taken only every few days.  -0.8607\n",

I've been on 225 mg a day for the past 5 years. Recently, we also added 20 mg of Buspar because I seem to be overly anxious at night. If it weren't for this medicine, I'd be a complete basketcase. Stick with it! The first year was tough for me as we changed my dose about 6 times. At first I felt super loopy, but now I'm very happy with the results.  0.7922\n",
      "I was on Paxil before, and did not like it. It took away all my emotion. I wouldn't cry when I was sad, and I wouldn't laugh when I was happy. It was wierd. I do not experience this with Effexor. I like that it helps with my anxiety without affecting my personality. I have experienced weight gain, but that has really been the only side effect. One thing i am worried about, is ever trying to get off this med. I have heard the withdrawal symptoms are insane. I have experienced wierd effects if I skip a dose; i.e. nausea, sensations in my brain (hard to explain), and the anxiety returns.  -0.7646\n",
      "Although this medication worked for decreasing my anxiety attacks, the side effects were too much for me to deal with.  I would continually have horrible nightmares, or even night terrors.  Every morning, I would wake up in a pool of sweat.  One recommendation I would give is if you decide this medication isn't the right one for you, make sure you talk to your doctor and set up a plan to slowly go off of Effexor...the withdrawal symptoms are really intense. -0.8275\n",

I am on 150mg in the morning, since when I used to take it at bedtime I would not be able to sleep so now I take it in the morning. I also take xanax \"as needed\". I have not experienced any sexual side effects, and my appetite has not increased or decreased, just stayed steady and I have in fact lost weight with this med. I am moving up to 225mg, just to try and make it so I don't have \"bad days\" as often as I do now, which is about once a week. I used to take lexapro and with that I didn't want to have sex ever and gained weight like crazy.

I have had a few classic symptoms of Effexor. I can't say \"loss\" of apetite, but definitely a noticeable decrease, blurry vision, drowsiness and dry mouth all the time.  I also have had pain in both shoulders and backs of my arms that I cannot attribute to anything else.   -0.8126\n",

      "I was on 150 MG for 2 years. Worked okay but I was never professionally diagnosed  with anxiety/depression before i started taking effexor. I was probably considered average by most professionals regarding levels of anxiety.  My family doctor put me on this med after I told her I get anxious at times and I wish i could go back in time and stopped myself from taking a brain altering med that my family doctor prescribed.  Not only was the weight gain horrible but the loss in sex drive drove me insane.  I finally decided to go off but the withdrawal was so horrible, i considered going back on this drug.  I had the usual side effects, brain zaps, etc.  But the emotional withdrawal symptoms is what is so devasting. I find myself crying and screaming when i'm alone and I have never ever had this problem pre-drug.  Please please, don't take this drug unless a trained counselor or doctor prescribes this and after much evaluation, finds this to be the correct route.  Family doctors aren't trained to see the signs of depression and anxiety.  My life is an absolute mess now and hopefully once all of the drug is out of me, i can lead a normal life.   -0.9803\n",
      "This was the first anti-depressant treatment I tried for anxiety. I was taking Xanax at the same time. I had to stop taking Effexor as it caused central nervous system depression, which if you take this type of combination long enough it can be fatal from my research. I stopped the drug after two days. Symptoms of central nervous system depression include: extreme drowsiness, losing your balance, pains in the back of your head, extreme mobility problems, extreme state of confusion.The only anti-depressants I would recommend based on my own experience to be used with any of the benzodiazepines(xanax,klonopin,ativan,librium,etc .) would be Zoloft or Remeron(mirtazapine). -0.9735\n",
      "Please, please, please do your research before going on this medication!   I was on it and all it did was cause weight gain, but coming off is hell.  Once you're on it, plan on staying on for life.  I've tried to come off this for three months, and went off the lowest dose two weeks ago.   I'm so dizzy I can't drive, can't work, and overall my quality of life is reduced to the point where I don't want to live anymore.

      "I take Effexxor XR 75mg, once a day, as I have for about 5 years. 75mg is the lowest dosage. It seems to be relatively effective. I have full medical insurance, yet the cost to fill my Effexxor has never been less than $97.00. Personally, I find that overly expensive. Most importantly, I'd caution any and everyone considering taking Effexxor to research its side effects beforehand. Personally, I found the side effects to be nothing short of nightmarish. I 'm very regimented about taking my Effexxor every day at roughly the same time everyday. On the rare occassion that I missed a dose, let's say on a Tuesday morning; by Wednesday morning & CERTAINLY by Wednesday evening, I am completely nauseous, my equilibrium is totally off kilter, my pupils begin to dilate, then decrease down to the size of a \"pin dot\", and alternate back & forth until I am able to take my next dose. I become extremely dizzy, and was literally afraid to drive my car. The side effects are so fierce, that I have only missed a dose perhaps 3 times in 5 years. Even then, it was a result of me unexpectedly having to stay overnight out of town on business - or some other extinuating circumstance. I don't mean to be disparaging, I'm simply an advocate of self education re: psychotherapeutic meds because every person reacts differently to any drug & often times, physicians can't quite fathom the toll certain aspects of certain drugs have on our personal health and lifestyle. 0.1613\n",

I attribute the increased angriness to this drug because i haven't had a problem since i've been off it.  There is a reason why it says not to drink alcohol while taking this med.  If thats a problem for you, then i would do some additional research.  also, the weight gain was awful.  I gained 20lbs in 3 months.  I'm usually very petite and this was such a tramautizing event for me that i became more depressed.  \r\n",
