0$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/28/2019 6:14:04 PM$Reviewer: Dee Dee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$5$"I was on 0.5 mg (1/2 milligram) 2x daily of regular Xanax for 15 years for panic attacks and anxiety disorder. It worked wonderfully and I had a very good quality of life with it. I had a job, got out of the house daily and lived my life much more normally. Suddenly last month, my psychiatrist of 20 years decided he no longer likes to prescribe regular xanax anymore. Well I had a very bad anxiety relapse when he prescribed me Xanax Extended Release 1 mg one time per day instead. It was horrible!! It felt like I didn't even take my xanax and I had waves of normalcy mixed with horrendous rolling anxiety and intermittent panic attacks daily, noon and nightly.

What I didn't know was that it was only giving me .25 mg at a time 4 times per day. Well I was used to the 1/2 of a milligram 2 times per day which was much stronger. People with anxiety or panic disorder notice every subtle detail and bodily change, so I started panicking when I felt like they weren't working. My anticipatory anxiety shot through the roof and I felt panicked for the past month. It was like a roller coaster ride!

I told my Dr. to please keep me on the original dosage of regular xanax that I was once taking and he refused and said XR is just as effective. He wouldn't listen to me even though I was on it for 15 years and never had to raise my dose. It seems now that all the doctors are too afraid of the feds, they are cracking down and no longer prescribing regular xanax. I quit my job because I could no longer function and didn't even feel calm enough to drive my car anymore because the anxiety was so great. 

I guess these doctors washed their hands with people like me because they are afraid of the government. Sometimes patients know what works better than the doctors and they should listen to us. 

My quality of life went down the tubes until I read on the internet a few days ago, that if I cut one of these tablets in half a 1/2 milligram (my old dose) immediately is dispensed throughout the b"

2$Condition: Panic Disorder$4/30/2017 12:40:13 PM$Reviewer: Godschild1, 75 or over on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$I've had Panic/Anxiety Disorder for most of my life, long before they had a name for it.  I see a psychiatrist and I've only had good results with Xanax XR. I have taken Xanax XR twice a day for years.  In all that time I  have only gone up by one .5mg.  I currently take .5 mg in morning and 1 mg around 7 p.m. according to my doctors instructions. I spent 18 years housebound with agoraphobia because I wouldn't take any meds to help me.  Big mistake on my part.  My best advise to anyone considering taking Xanax is if you have a psychiatrist you trust, do so and do not pay attention to any horror stories about Xanax XR that you see online. Some of us because of the circumstances of life or our biological makeup, like me, may need extra help. If you have any questions about, save them for your doctor.  The only minus is you may feel a little sedated for the first 7 to 10 days.  I did because I'm very sensitive to most medicines because I metabolize them quickly. Final word...Xanax XR literally saved my life.    
3$Condition: Panic Disorder$11/27/2016 6:21:51 PM$Reviewer: Glen45, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I will say I originally took regular Xanax, as opposed to the xr.  Initially, it was very effective, but it didn't last as long as I needed.  I needed a medication that was longer lasting.  Xanax xr is that medication.  I'm noticing many people commenting on this medication claiming they take it three times a day.  That doesn't make any sense.  The whole reason for this is so you don't have to dose three times a day. If you just have an occasional panic attack, you would definitely benefit more from the traditional Xanax. It works strongly and quickly.  But it doesn't linger like other benzos like klonopin. I really think I'm going to go back to klonopin. I took that a few years ago and found it effective, but my doctor, for some strange reason put me on Xanax. Klonopin is a strong, long acting medication that works very well.  Xanax xr works but it's very expensive as compared to klonopin. But that's just my opinion.
4$Condition: Other$5/8/2015 7:50:15 PM$Reviewer: LatterDaisySaint, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have bipolar depression and severe anxiety. I had regular Xanax for as-needed use but I didn't feel it really helped and never understood how people get addicted to it. It got so bad recently that I constantly felt like I was having a heart attack. I felt extreme irritation, rage, panic. My Psych switched me to Xanax XR and after the very first pill I felt.....NORMAL. I could actually enjoy my children again. The chest pain/discomfort left immediately. I feel pretty tired in the afternoon but I'll take that over how badly I was feeling. I give this drug an A+ and am SO grateful for it.

6$Condition: Other$12/19/2014 3:07:49 AM$Reviewer: Working Man, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I currently take 1 mg. XR one or two times a day.  The 'classic' beneficial effects of Xanax are all there. Onset: 30 minutes after swallowing. From that moment it feels like a 0.5 mg. immediate release tab but the effects last a good 8 hours. (If you're familiar with immediate release Xanax tabs then you know the effects of those come & leave within 2 hours). Xanax XR still carries the typical side effects of immediate release Xanax: very vivid dreams, slight disinhibition and brief moments of forgetfulness during the day. Overall an A+ plus though, I prefer it over it over Valium.
7$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/16/2014 12:04:48 PM$Reviewer: Girl25, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have daily anxiety and was on ativan for a while and while I loved the ativan I was looking for something longer acting - my psychiatrist tried me on Xanax XR .05mg. For me, this drug is a God send. In the beginning when I first starting taking it I did notice some slight dizzyness and 'weird' feelings but I stuck with it and once it regulated in my system (about 3-4 weeks) I feel totally normal and calm on it with zero side effects. I have since upped my dose to the 1mg Xanax XR twice daily if I need it, but some days I only take one pill to get me through the day and deal with the anxiety at night since I'm home and then take a pill in the morning like normal. My advice would be to start it on the lowest dose and work your way up. Also be aware that Xanax XR does sometimes interact with other meds so check to see if it interferes with anything else you're taking or will take in the future.

Sleep at night even with sleep machine(gives off different sounds to help one sleep)was very tough at times due to level of ear noise. Xanax generic .5 mg does help but due to the additive effect of Xanax I break it up if noise goes down after two nights of taking .5 mg I break it in half and take .25 mg till noise level gets back up to say a 8-9 on 10 scale. I fear the additive effects of Xanax so I try to keep the amount down till the noise starts to really get on my nerves before I take the .5mg only at night just before bed time. I do wake up feeling fine wish they would find some cure for Tinnitus maybe one day they will. Bad enough to be have some hearing loss but to add the Tinnitus on top of that is sure not much fun at any age.

16$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/24/2013 5:21:01 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$1$4$I had severe panic attacks and was a mess. I hate taking medication but was finally at a point where I was willing to do about anything. So, my psychiatrist prescribed me Xanax Xr 1mg 3 times per day and sublingual, very fast acting Xanax (Niravam) for use as well. It all did work to bring my anxiety down and if I took enough of it, it would finally break through the horrible panic attacks. However, and it is a BIG however, if you are deciding to take this drug or are recently on it, PLEASE look for an alternative. Seven years later and mostly anxiety free, I decided to taper off. The withdrawal is horrific. There are truly no words to describe how debilitating it is. PLEASE investigate withdrawal yourself. Do an online search for The Ashton Manual and you will understand. I have missed 2 months of work now and thankfully I own my own company so I can do this but it is not without intense symptoms and so much suffering...thousands of dollars in medical bills and most importantly a loss of being able to live a normal life. Withdrawal is not short term...some effects may last years. Please just really consider this. I hope my review will spare someone else what I am going through.

I take it an hour or so before bed and finally I can sleep.  The effects last throughout most of the day for me and have helped me to work more effectively in therapy.  Only 1MG a day, but have been on 2MG a day during a rough period.  Does cause drowsiness, but I found that this went away after a couple of days and also eating a meal with the dose.

I can now do things that are a common activity for most people.  I've always dealt with some type of anxiety in new or social situations.  Now taking 1MG of Xanax XR my nervousness and anxiety are gone.  If I have a day that I know will be long I have a smaller prescription of the 2mg pill and this last all day.  Can't say enough about how this medicine has changed my life.  I look at it like take blood pressure medicine and it's something my body needs.  I hope it will always be available.  I have not felt the need to keep upping my dosage and believe with self control it is not additive.  It get's me over the hump."

25$Condition: Panic Disorder$4/12/2012 1:38:37 AM$Reviewer: girl87, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I was diagnosed with a panic/anxiety disorder approximately 8 yrs ago. I have tried every type of drug possible to calm me down & nothing worked. Finally, after seeing a psychiatrist he prescribed the regular xanax 1.0mg (3 per day). As, a worry wart that I am, I refused to take 3 a day for the fear of dependancy. I would only take 1 per day & at the most 1 1/2 per day, which did help with the calming. Then about 3 months ago he decided to try the xanax xr 3mg per day. After a week of that, I found I was so sleepy! I went from climbing the walls to sleeping all the time. The dose was way to much for me. So, after the 1st month he lowered it to 2mg per day & so far it has been much better. As we all know these kind of meds can become addictive & that was just another thing I had to worry about, but I finally tried to use the power of my mind to NOT let myself get addicted to them, and I also look at it this way. If I can live close to a somewhat normal life again instead of being a figity hermit, then I am all for it. So far I can say that I am not 100% my normal self, but this is the closest I have been to it in the last 8yrs! I would definetly try it, if you got anxiety & don't worry about the addictiveness. If you got a good dr. that will watch you closely & that you are not abusing them, I think you will be fine! Life is to short to not enjoy it like you once did, so I say give it a shot & try it. If someone would've told me they had panic/anxiety attks 10+ yrs ago, I would've thought they were crazy! Trust me, they are scarey, they are very real, & I don't wish them on anyone. But, I am VERY thankful that I have finally found something to take the edge off!!

I think that it really varies between people. I always thought that the side effects were from lack of sleep but it turns out that the lack of sleep is from Xanax too. Very addictive, it's almost easy to abuse. Withdrawl is painful and can occur after two weeks of 4mg. 

Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects. Don't make the mistake I made."

I was able to function in ways I hadnt been able to before. BUT my experience took a turn for the worse. I ended up in the hospital twice in one week because I had seizures due to lowering my dose. I became highly addicted. Because of the seizures my doctor decided I should try to stop completely. Weaning off of course but I might as well have gone cold turkey. The withdrawl symptoms are horrible. I couldnt sleep, eat, think clearly, i was throwing up all the time. My body hurt. I was frustrated. My anxiety was ten times worse than it had ever been. Take my advice, stay away, find another alternative. Xanax will ruin your life in the long run. I have been off Xanax for over 2 months now and still experiece horrible side affects. I have terrible headaches EVERYDAY. I still feel so sick to my stomach all the time and usually end up throwing up. I have researed it over and over again. This can last for up to 18 months. I have been unemployed throughout this process because i cant seem to leave my house. it has ruined me. Coming back from this is so hard. im doing my best. If i had known that i would go through all of this I NEVER would have taken it in the first place. If you HAVE to have something try Klonopin. (not sure if i spelled that right) it is so much better for you. its in the same family of xanax but not so addictive. it gives you the same benefits. i just want everyone to know that xanax is horrible. these educated doctors who prescribe it are wrong, they know what it does and still prescribe. shame on them. 
Its not worth it...just my opinion but seriously think of the long term affects first. "
65$Condition: Panic Disorder$11/19/2009 11:07:31 PM$Reviewer: Wulfbringer, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been using the 2mg XR for anxiety/panic attacks for almost 4 years now. I am greatful for this drug; I feel comfortable in large crowds unlike before. I feel like I am relaxed throughout the day, and don't worry as much as before I started taking this drug. There have been a few times when my script has lapsed before my regular doctor's visit, and just for the few days of not taking it I haven't really experienced any serious side effects. I used to grind my teeth at night and constantly waking up through the night with my fists clinched up, or just not being able to sleep at all. Overall, I feel great, not always feeling anxious or panicing about the daily grind at work. I work in a restuarant, and was always getting stressed very easily. This drug has turned my life around for me. I also suffer from chronic migraines triggered by stress, this has also helped keep my stress level down to help prevent the frequency of those migraines. As with any drug, this is not for everyone. It works for me.

What I like about Xanax XR compared to some other drugs in this class is that it stays in the system, continuously working all day, so I don't have to worry about taking my next dose on time, for example if I'm stuck on a delayed flight. The downside is that since I have been on these medications for so long, my psychiatrist (a specialist in psycho-pharmacology) has told me I will need to take this for life. That's fine with me; I look at it just like medication for diabetes or high blood pressure. Anyway, that would be the case with any benzodiazepine. I'm functioning well and sleeping well, taking 4-5 mg. per day for several years now.

99$Condition: Other$4/30/2008 5:34:47 PM$Reviewer: Xanax, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I HIGHLY discourage any person from using this drug. Regardless of how anxious you may feel or if you have panic attacks, DON'T take it. I was on it for 6 months when prescribed by my family medicine doctor for occassional anxiety; I later went to the head phycologist at a nationally renound hospital in Washington. He is a lead prof in the School of Medicine, Phycology department. My new doctor spends 1 full day of class lecture on Xanax alone, and why NOT to prescribe it! This is serious...I attempted to stop taking the medication; only to find you have a serious risk of having a seizure and cannot stop cold turkey. The withdrawls are HORRIBLE, and you must wean yourself off Xanax! Because I was only on it for 6 months I went from 4pm/day to 2mg/day for 1 week, 1mg/day for 1 week, then .5mg/day for the last week and still had serious withdrawls. My doctor said patients who are on Xanax for longer periods of time, 2 years+, it can take them up to a year to get off it! And you can't rebound or relapse, you'll do nothing but hurt yourself even more! Even if you do take it to get rid of anxiety, it will get worse because your body becomes quickly dependant and immune to it, requiring higher dosages.I do not blog or post online, but I had to spread the word. I am an honors students, very stable, no drug addictions or problems, just a normal guy; so those who are prone to relapse or abuse Xanax, BE AWARE. Bottom line; in no circumstance take Xanax, if you're on it currently the best of luck getting off! Do as you wish, but thought I'd let you in on a little secret.

115$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/13/2007 9:50:01 AM$Reviewer: bessvann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I have been suffering, and I mean suffering, from panic attacks for the past several months.  I have never had this condition before.  I was placed on Xanax XR about a week ago, but I am afraid to take it at work as I have to be on my feet and interacting with the public (ugh) 8-10 hours per day.  Any suggestions or warnings?
