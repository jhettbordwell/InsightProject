5$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$3/26/2019 3:50:11 PM$Reviewer: Jan, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$1$5$I'm using Estradiol Transdermal System 0.05 mg/day once weekly patch produced by Sandoz A Novartis Division. The product has greatly improved my symptoms. HOWEVER, it's almost impossible to keep the patch from coming off.  This happens sometimes the first day of application. More often it occurs in the shower. Before applying I clean the area with alcohol to be sure there is nothing to prevent the patch from sticking and I allow plenty of time for the area to dry prior to application. When one comes off I'm usually able to reuse the patch but this should not happen. The medicated side of the patch should not be exposed to anything other than my skin from the time it's applied until I remove it for a new application. My insurance will only approve a one month supply (4 patches) at one time which does not allow time to get replacements should I have to throw one away. I would love to know if the company is working to address this problem because I have seen other reviews listing this as an issue.

Since using the patches, i have slept better at night, no more hot flashes! Thank you! I've had more energy, probably because i get a good night sleep now, before i was awaken all through the night with terrible hot flashes, i suffered with them severely through out each day too. Not any more :) I haven had any weight gain or side effects from the patches. Havent had them fall off either. The main thing is do not put them where your panty line is on your waiste, i apply mine in the center of my butt cheek, i've never had a problem with them coming off at all.Wish i would have gotten on them a long time ago, instead of letting myself suffer. Total life changer for me.

This product is much larger than the patch I used when I began HRT treatment and it doesn't stick well. It comes off after a day or two! I was told this is a generic brand and I believe it.

I'm also on a weight loss program. And as bad as it sounds I do not want to gain any weight. My question is: is taking this drug really nec or is it to only alleviate symptoms? I asked my nurse the same ? And she said yes it's nec esp foe osteoporosis..is that It? I'm 48 I don't want to die from the side effects before I even have a chance to get the osteoporosis. Can anyone help with this? Or less me to where I can get an answer as to what to do. Thank you so much (the ratings are not true just to post the ?)

They are a poor substitute.  They are at least 3 times the size and donÃ¢Â?Â?t stay on very well.  After 1-2 days they start to peel.  Also, they are not very effective as my hot flashes and insomnia have returned since taking them.

Which put me into menopause. Was put on Estradiol Transdermal System twice a week. Used patches along with vaginal cream faithfully. So far this patch has not worked for me. Intercourse with my husband is very very painful. Was hoping reading these reviews would help me understand and not feel like I am the only women this is happening to. Sad to say it seems like the only problem these women have is a small rash and problems getting patch to stick. Not trying to make it seem like these problems don't matter. Was wanting and praying for answers. The reviews were more focused on the side effects rather than information on how it has helped these women. My Dr. never discussed with me how painful intercourse would be and that may be that way for the duration. Going on 4 years now. Just looking for answers and praying for a solution.

After about 18 months started developing rash under patch off and on, then came the edema, then severe back pain and finally debilitating pelvic pain. It wasn't until I stopped using it because of the rashes that I realized it was all connected. Two weeks after stopping it all was normal.  Went back to pill and lower estrogen with night sweats. At least the pain is gone.

If it's more of a styrofoam patch then I can do anything with it without it falling off. But if it's the clear patches they move around and my symptoms start coming back. But I like the patch over taking pills.

It is so easy to use and it is one less pill I have to take orally but I do have a hard time keeping it on, I sit in a hot tub quite frequently, but even when I don't I have trouble keeping this patch attached. I use the generic form, maybe the original would stay on better
54$Condition: Other$1/10/2009 2:24:54 PM$Reviewer: Linda Lou, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$This generic patch works and stays in place so good that I think this generic patch stays on very good.  It has never loosened even with multiple showering and washing.  Maybe the person who thought they didn't work wasn't putting them on a clean, hairless area of skin.
55$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$1/6/2008 7:47:20 AM$Reviewer: $4$1$1$This patch DOES NOT stay on.  I have to use Tegaderm to keep this patch on.  Terrible.  Don't use this generic patch.

In three years I've never had a problem getting it to stay on the whole week. Using name brand or generic I have to alternate patch from left and right abdomen due to slight itching whenever I place it on upper buttocks. It isn't clear but it works perfectly for me."
