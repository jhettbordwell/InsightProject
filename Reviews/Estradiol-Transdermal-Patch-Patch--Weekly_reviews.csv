5$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$3/26/2019 3:50:11 PM$Reviewer: Jan, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$1$5$I'm using Estradiol Transdermal System 0.05 mg/day once weekly patch produced by Sandoz A Novartis Division. The product has greatly improved my symptoms. HOWEVER, it's almost impossible to keep the patch from coming off.  This happens sometimes the first day of application. More often it occurs in the shower. Before applying I clean the area with alcohol to be sure there is nothing to prevent the patch from sticking and I allow plenty of time for the area to dry prior to application. When one comes off I'm usually able to reuse the patch but this should not happen. The medicated side of the patch should not be exposed to anything other than my skin from the time it's applied until I remove it for a new application. My insurance will only approve a one month supply (4 patches) at one time which does not allow time to get replacements should I have to throw one away. I would love to know if the company is working to address this problem because I have seen other reviews listing this as an issue.

Just was witched to Generic Estradoil 60 days ago, headaches, hot flashes are back, patches do no stay on until next dose.  Waste of money. Went back to Miniville

All of a sudden I started having sever itching at the site with redness, inflammation as well as discoloration of the skin where the patches were.
8$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$9/7/2018 10:44:39 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Estradiol is a life saver for me. Im so thankful. Since using the patches, i have slept better at night, no more hot flashes! Thank you! I've had more energy, probably because i get a good night sleep now, before i was awaken all through the night with terrible hot flashes, i suffered with them severely through out each day too. Not any more :) I haven had any weight gain or side effects from the patches. Havent had them fall off either. The main thing is do not put them where your panty line is on your waiste, i apply mine in the center of my butt cheek, i've never had a problem with them coming off at all.Wish i would have gotten on them a long time ago, instead of letting myself suffer. Total life changer for me.

This product is much larger than the patch I used when I began HRT treatment and it doesn't stick well. It comes off after a day or two! I was told this is a generic brand and I believe it. I also notice my scalp itches and my breast are EXTREMELY sore!! 
10$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$2/12/2018 7:57:28 PM$Reviewer: Pomcpom , 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Hello..I have not even begun to take my hrt..i was prescribed the pill, premarin cream and the patch..not all to be used of course. I am very leery about using any H rt. It seems there Re so many dangers. Breast cancer, stroke, heart attack. I do have all the menopausal symptoms. I have 1 remaining ovary. I'm also on a weight loss program. And as bad as it sounds I do not want to gain any weight. My question is: is taking this drug really nec or is it to only alleviate symptoms? I asked my nurse the same ? And she said yes it's nec esp foe osteoporosis..is that It? I'm 48 I don't want to die from the side effects before I even have a chance to get the osteoporosis. Can anyone help with this? Or less me to where I can get an answer as to what to do. Thank you so much (the ratings are not true just to post the ?)
11$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$2/3/2018 1:56:44 PM$Reviewer: Padme, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$I have been using Estrodot successfully for a couple of months when I was offered the generic brand.   They are a poor substitute.  They are at least 3 times the size and donÃ¢Â?Â?t stay on very well.  After 1-2 days they start to peel.  Also, they are not very effective as my hot flashes and insomnia have returned since taking them.

Also had diarrhea and headaches but it did help with the hot flashes and night sweats. I think it also caused brain fog and some depression. Not worth it, so I just took it off and threw it away. Back to normal for me. 
13$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$11/3/2016 8:18:06 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$4$Initial few months were great. Reduced hot flashes letting me go through my day more normally. After 6 months noticed weight gain and swelling in feet ankles. Since no other changes believe it must be the patch. Will be stopping use this week as concerned about effect on other body systems. Good thing winter is coming so I can cool off more quickly. 
14$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$8/26/2016 6:48:23 PM$Reviewer: Wp356, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$The Estradiol transdermal patch and a Progesterone pill has been somewhat effective in relieving menopausal night sweats, vaginal dryness, and hot flashes.  However after 6 months and a lower dosage change I have gained 12 pounds, my hair is falling out, my skin and scalp itch, I'm bloated and not motivated to get to the gym.  Not sure what is worse, menopause or the hormone treatment.

I've gained 20lbs in the month and a half since I starting using this patch.  The patch itches and burns and leaves a rash.  I've only used it on my upper buttock.  I am afraid to place it on my stomach.
16$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$12/22/2015 7:59:33 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$5$Used on my bottom. Felt great. After about 18 months started developing rash under patch off and on, then came the edema, then severe back pain and finally debilitating pelvic pain. It wasn't until I stopped using it because of the rashes that I realized it was all connected. Two weeks after stopping it all was normal.  Went back to pill and lower estrogen with night sweats. At least the pain is gone.

Switched to upper buttock and after 4 days another very itchy rash.  Does not say on well. Rashes took 2 weeks to calm down and disappear even after treating them.
18$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$8/27/2015 8:26:03 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$2$1$Original large round patch worked well and was easy to use. Recently it was replaced with a smaller oblong patch that is hard to apply and will not stay on. Also causes rashes on the abdomen. 
19$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$5/13/2015 6:59:57 AM$Reviewer: GG, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$"I started using this patch after hormonal changes due to a benign brain tumor surgery near my pituitary gland. At first the patch didn't stay on at all. As time went on it seems to stay on longer after showers and making sure to repress the edges to make it stay. Over time I have developed rashes on the areas it has been applied to but they slowly disappear. 

Side effects I've noticed are clear breast discharge, extreme lower back pain, nervousness, lack of concentration (more than usual), irritability, weight gain and restlessness. "
20$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$2/1/2014 5:56:53 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$3$I have been using this patch for almost 3 years after a total hysterectomy.  The patch did not stay on for more than 2 days on my lower tummy.  I switched and started wearing on the top of my bottom.  Have not had any issues with it staying on all week.  Last week I changed back to my tummy and broke out in a terrible rash where the patch was.  It was awful.  Going to try it on my backside again and hope I don't get a rash again!

I love it ! It stays on, does not irritate my skin.  I can honestly say I am feeling normal... Climara is a God send.

Re this smaller patch, it works if you can keep it on--; Alleviates all symptoms of menopause but DOES NOT stay on. I didn't even know it had come off until I started itching. Looked in the mirror and found a patch sized itchy rash where the patch had been. I have never had a reaction until this little patch. The reaction is not bad enough to stop using. This patch works but make sure it's still on."
23$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$4/28/2012 10:31:12 PM$Reviewer: autumn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$"I have had ms for 47 years. Post menopausel, I used oral Ogen for years. Then my presciption program stopped covering my Ogen but WOULD cover this patch. Loved the idea of not taking a pill every day. The patch stayed on.
When I started getting diarrhea and suddenly couldn't make it to the bathroom on time, just thought it was my ms. After cleaning up a mess all through my livingroom and a bathroom that looked like a haircoloring bottle had burst, I removed the patch and waited.
No more breast tenderness, no more diarrhea, no more fear of going for a walk or a drive, or a DVT, I'll just live with the night sweats.
That was BAD--;"

25$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$6/14/2010 6:09:51 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$1$1$Do not use the generic patch. It does not stay on. 
26$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$10/12/2009 2:13:30 AM$Reviewer: aim47, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on this medication for 6 years. I started out on premarin, and had headaches, with nervousness. Doctor tried me on Clamira 0.05mg. And it was wonderful. Made me feel like my old self again. I like the idea of taking a low dose of hormone. And this one of the lowest they make. Plus no pill to take. Change patch once a week and I'm good to go. Be sure when you put it on that you rub for 10 seconds around the outer egde so it will stick better.
27$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$3/17/2009 6:02:06 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$1$4$I had been taking Cenestin (syntheic estrogen) for several years with no side effects. My MD decided I should try a more natural estrogen replacement.  Everything was fine for 4 weeks.  Then, within 1.5 weeks I gained 7+ lbs, had pittiing edema in my ankles, swollen thighs and calves and developed a miserable yeast infection.  I'm going back to Cenestin!!

29$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$1/6/2008 7:47:20 AM$Reviewer: $4$1$1$This patch DOES NOT stay on.  I have to use Tegaderm to keep this patch on.  Terrible.  Don't use this generic patch.
