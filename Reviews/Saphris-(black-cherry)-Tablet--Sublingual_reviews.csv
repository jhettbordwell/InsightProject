The pill works most nights in allowing me to fall asleep.  I often will wake up after sleeping two to three hours but usually can fall back asleep with little difficulty.  The medication is sublingual and dissolves quickly.  I've gained 15 pounds since I've been on the medication.  
1$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$6/28/2018 2:44:29 AM$Reviewer: Spice, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$My doctor gave me this medication on yesterday. I took the medication and in less than 15mins I was very dizzy and couldnt control my body functions. I could barely move my eyes. It put me to sleep for 12hours however my body couldnt move.Someone else can have this medication but it wont be me.

You cannot eat ten minutes after administration (and ten minutes before according to my doctor). It's supposed to sit in your mouth for three minutes, but last night I sneezed after ingesting so who knows if I got the full dosage or not.  The tin foil packaging can pop the pill out on to the floor, and at $6 a pill (depending on insurance coverage), you can't waste any.  Ask your doctor about timing dosages with intimacy.  Still, other medications are awful, they deaden compared to the effects of this, and I have been taking these medications since the age of 19."

I Have Been Over Medicated For Years For Bi Polar Disorder Wit Several Hospitalizations Resulting From Psychotic   Episodes As One Of The Side Effects. I Have Never Had Regular Sleep Patterns, Nor I Been Able To Stay Asleep For More Than A Couple Hours. This Medication Lets Me Get Uninterrupted Sleep For 6-8 Hours EVERY Night! It Has Also Replaced 6 Other Medications I Had Been Taking! I Hope These GREAT Results Continues!

Was so confused the next morning that I literally felt like I lost a day's time.  Adding to consistently sore muscles? uhhh... thanks, but no thanks! 
5$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$6/21/2016 1:14:52 AM$Reviewer: AERH, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$3$5$The medication is very helpful.  But it tastes TERRIBLE and my doctor says that almost every patient that he has on it complains about the taste. He also said that him and several of his patients including me have even called the manufacturer about the taste. I wish there was either an additional form that wasn't sublingual or if they could have a verity of flavor options. Especially since you are not supposed to eat or drink (even water) for ten minutes after taking it. To be honest so I don't have to deal with the taste as much I will just swallow it or put it in a small class of carbonated-flavored water, soda, or juice. Other than the taste the medication is really helpful.

7$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$3/5/2016 9:41:22 PM$Reviewer: Mike, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$This medication ruined my life. I completely lost my appetite, couldn't hardly walk, was too weak to do anything and it cost me my career. I started doing better immediately after I stopped taking it after I complained to my doctor several times. I do not recommend this medication under any condition. It is horrid.
8$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$2/21/2016 7:28:22 AM$Reviewer: shoshana, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$"When I first started Saphris, I thought it was a miracle drug. I was prescribed Saphris 2.5mg to boost the effects of my Lexapro 30mg. Within a day of taking my first dose of Saphris, my depression lifted completely and I felt better than I had in years. Unfortunately I developed a Type 1 allergic reaction with wheezing, puffy face and hands, dry skin and mouth, incredible thirst and itching and had to stop Saphris after just a few days. Coming off of Saphris is no picnic. DO NOT drink alcohol while discontining Saphris - I had two glasses of wine one night and was so suicidal I almost drove to the hospital. Two days later, I am having vivid nightmares and ""exploding head"" sensations and I still feel fragile and confused. I'm taking Claritin D and Pepcid AC to help with the puffiness and itchiness and I am still not comfortable. Can't wait to get this med out of my system."
9$Condition: Schizophrenia$2/15/2016 3:41:51 PM$Reviewer: martinhersey, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$The first month gave me some problems with side effects. After that, no problems that I can remember. I take it at bedtime along with another AP for sleep. It does a good job of putting me to sleep almost immediately. Apparently, it continues its work during the following day.
10$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$10/5/2015 11:50:43 AM$Reviewer: Florida, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$2$OMG. This was among the most terrifying experiences of my life.  My doctor gave me sample to try to handle general depressing.  The side effects took 3 to 4 months to kick in and no benefit meanwhile.  The side effects were that my vision was so blurry that when I went to an optomitrist to she couldn't believe how fast my vision was detriorating as by the time the glasses were ready, they had to be redone. She asked if I was on any new medications and this was when I finally figured it out. It left me with permanent eye sight damage months later!  To compound, it has the effect of your handwriting getting smaller and smaller until you can't write!  Watch out for this stuff as if you're depressed, it could cause you to totally lose your mind when you can't see or write to compound your situation!
11$Condition: Other$9/17/2015 5:26:46 PM$Reviewer: hsdallas, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have a difficult time getting to sleep and I wake several times through the night. This medication has helped my condition. I used to always feel tired even if I'd been in bed for 12hrs. Now I can wake up and feel rested after about 8hrs. This medication is strong and I take half the dose prescribed otherwise I get the shakes and feel itchy all over.

Ive been using sasphris for about 4 years. If i miss adose psychotic mania looms ahead. I do get some very bothersome side effects. Facils ticks,grinding my teeth. Pacing pacing this one bothers everyone a great deal.i take klonipin to help the akathesia but if i take enough ""Kpin"" to even me out it causes such bad amnesia. But still a great drug for me"
13$Condition: Schizophrenia$5/19/2015 3:24:50 PM$Reviewer: Cj, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I herd voice and seen things scene I was a kid and now with this I have a new live. I have put on weight but this seems to be the only thing that has taken the voice and seeing things away. I take the black cherry in the morning and then at dinner. I'm able to do more then I ever have and my friends notice a difference in me and it feels so good. I'm even able to listen to music again and TV or movies. So the weight gain something I'm learning to deal with and eat better meals. I can sleep also which is a big change. Now I'm getting about 7 to 8 hours of sleep and waking up rested. So I feel this med is will though the try!!!!!!!!!

I couldn't stand up without passing out within 2-3 minutes, consistently.  I remember thinking to myself ""if this is what everyday felt like, I'd rather be dead.""  I had to go to the ER, as it dumped my blood pressure way below my normal, which is already low."

Initially, it was a transition, but after a while, I noticed my relating to people was 100% better, and I was sleeping soundly through the night, whereas before I was waking up at 2 AM and no matter what I did I couldn't get back to sleep. Best drug that ever happened to me.

I can finally control my moods and I seem to get along with people better. However, I also take Geodon, which my doctor says the two medicines together is what is working wonders.
