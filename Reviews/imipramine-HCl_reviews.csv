He has been wetting the bed 90% of nights since birth. He took it for 16 months - he started at 25mg for about 6-8 months, then increased to 50mg when he had the occasional wet night. This had completely changed his life. Since starting imipramine, he has had maybe 5 or 6 wet nights. That's in the last year and a half. He is DDAVP resistant and this was the answer for him. I didn't find it changed his personality much. If anything, he seemed a bit more focused and calm but nothing substantial.

I was drawn out, and restless. And when it came to sleep, just forget about it! I did not even get a solid hour of sleep! Doctor told me this could most likely help with my sleeping, definitely made it worse! So disappointed. I'm so desperate to find a medicine that actually works for me ):

(My mom passed away exactly a year later.) Trying to focus at work was impossible. REM sleep was non-existent. My psychiatrist rx'ed Lunesta, Ambien CR, & a host of other sleep aids...nothing worked. When I finally opted to see another psychiatrist as an inpatient,he rx'ed imipramine. I started out @ 25 mg., which had no effect. The doctor gave me an additional 25 mg. each nite until I reached 100 mg. I cannot express what it was like to finally sleep, really sleep. I still remember having my 1st dream in years! This psychiatrist had been a doctor in Viet Nam, & had prescribed imipramine to all pilots in order for them to get a good night's sleep & wake up refreshed. There is no ""hangover"" effect with this medication. I truly feel that it saved my sanity, if not my life.       "
8$Condition: Panic Disorder$12/10/2014 12:16:25 AM$Reviewer: Working Man, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$2$By far imipramine has the harshest side effect profile of all the tricyclic antidepressants (trimipramine runs a close second). It's a shame because imipramine works very well. I took it only at bedtime, as an adjunct to my 3x/day Xanax for panic attacks, but man -- throughout the following day dizziness, blurred vision, heart flutters & sticky mouth was, oh man, strong. Also had this other weird side effect, felt like my penis was being pinched & strangulated. Very harsh side effects. Yes, all the tricyclics have the same set of side effects, but it's usually not so noticeable at low, therapeutic doses. I much prefer nortryptiline (Pamelor) which works every bit as good for anxiety, preventing panic attacks and general depression, but the side effects aren't nearly as prominent as imipramine's. In fact I'd be surprised if imipramine is even prescribed anymore.

I started treatment with SSRI's then later my dr. added imipramine, then did SSRI's alone, but it only worked for only about 5 years, making depression worse at the end. Took imipramine along and had better results with tri-cyclic.
13$Condition: Problems with Bladder Control$2/9/2014 8:21:52 PM$Reviewer: Yankee07MVP, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$1$1$5$Prescribed to reduce urgency of urination due to enlarge prostate. Was suppose to take three 10mg tablets a day. Wrongly took one 10mg tablet a day for over a month. No help what-so-ever with my problem. I did however, experience an a pronounced decrease in the ability to sleep at night. When dosing error was discovered, I had stopped taking this drug for about a week. Resumed at recommended dosage, (10mg tablet three times a day). Immediately felt dizziness and anxiety taking this drug and just as quickly stopped taking it again.
14$Condition: Other$1/21/2014 4:33:35 PM$Reviewer: Happy Old Man, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"In my 74th year I have suffered for over 35 years with epigastric pain. I formerly had a resection of lower colon for diverticulosis in 1994. I suffered from debilitation abdominal pain almost ecvery day. By chance, a friend was taking this drug for depression and offered me a pill at bed time and said it will make ""Me sleep better.""  Why not? I thought it was a sleeping pill.  I went to bed and the next day my epgastric pain was gone, bowel sounds galore and things started to move in digestion. No longer have constipation or the opposite or abdominal pain.
   Funny, I am not depressed at all, have a great life as a retired professional, have a boat, many homes, cars  and doing just fine. I had MRIs cat scans, barium swallows etc. etc. and they found nothing. I short, I have my life back. The only down side is that I wake up early (4AM)sometimes and feel a tad tired in the late afternoon.   
   This help  may be anecdotal as to me, but it cured a problem no doctor could cure and it was just by chance. I notice no side effects other then an earlier rise then usual which is 5:30 AM.I take 10 mg and sometimes cut them in half (5mg)  or skip a day or two. Amazing luck . As an aside, i got a warning   letter in the mail about this drug. As a old cynic watching the money cycle in drug companies, I think the drug companies sent this out to get you on  a more expensive anti-depressent. (that is its primary use I am told). This drug is cheap and I guess their monopoly on it has expired. Big Pharma's motto is ""Make as much as you can as fast as you can.""  You be the judge."

Went on Imipramine for 1 year, then went off when wanted to have 2nd baby. Developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Went back on Imipramine as it is constipating and doctor thought I should try this pill again as I was better on it. Now 21 years later I still take a very low dosage 20 mg for my IBS. Everytime I have tried to go right off, my IBS systems flare up (chronic diarrahea, naseau, cramping). Imipramine has been a life saver for me. Although I do worry about what the long term effects are, being on this drug for so long. Like what harm is it doing to internal organs, kidneys etc., if any? I guess if I didnt worry about stuff like that I wouldnt have IBS!! Have to take good care of my teeth because of the dry mouth side effect. I am definitely better on this pill then off!

The Dr who prescribed it only would give a 1 week prescription so I went to my primary doctor and after checking, gave me a 1 month refilable prescription. When I saw him in 6 months later he was estatic and said it worked for 5 more patients who had phobias It is a godsend to me and a friend of mine who has a phobia. Her Dr said there was a newer medicine that was a good but it didn't work so he finally prescribed Imipimine and it solved her problem.

They progressively became more frequent and stronger.  In early 1990, I finally spoke with my PCP about them.

It hasn't done much at all for my Fibro, but it has helped my CFS so much! I can sleep at night, but still wake up with my alarm and I'm alert all through the day! Honestly the fatigue was worse for my schooling than the pain from Fibro, because the fatigue prevented me from even going to class. But now even though I'm in pain, I'm not constantly exhausted and sleeping. It does cause me to yawn more than I used to, and I'm having constipation, but the benefits are worth it. Now I just have to find something to take with it for the Fibro. I recommend this medicine highly for those with CFS!

I was then put on Paxil and had to discontinue from a bad side effect and then finally Lexapro which I took for 2 years.  It helped some but gave me nightmares and taking it before bed kept me up all night for those 2 years which was horrible!  I was then recommended to see a Psychiatrist last year for my condition which was getting worse and I was having between 30-40 panic attacks a day (yes that's not a typo unfortunately).  I was miserable, had to quit college, work and could barely function even at home!  Had attacks even if I stayed home and avoided my triggers (driving, going into stores or malls, large buildings, church and even in the shower), my life had come to a screeching halt and I had no desire to live anymore and felt I had no purpose in living!  Well, now I've been on Imipramine for 11 months and it has turned my life around and I credit this med for saving my life and the Dr who put me on it of course!!!  There are the side effects like dry mouth, nausea, stomach pain, headaches, sensitivity to sunlight, dizziness & lightheaded, sweating, etc. but after a few months of slowing upping my dose my body has become use to the drug and all I can see now is how I am almost a different person and have much fewer, less severe, easier to handle panic attacks when I do have them which depends on my stress level now.  I maybe have 1 a week or less and depend much less on taking my Xanex with the 3-4 .25 mg a day before! I have gone 2-3 weeks without the Xanex now and have recently hit my highest dose of Imipramine at 100mg and that seems to work best for me. For those of you who suffer from terrifying Panic Disorder and are not getting any relief, try this...I have reacted amazingly well to this and I hope you do too!  DON""T GIVE UP!!!!"

It seems to be effective in reducing the episodic variation, but does not reduce getting up to less than about three times.  I do have a problem with constipation for which I take a stool softener.

I went to the doctor time and time again because of my sudden diarrhea every morning going to school. It got so bad that I would wake up about an hour before school just to use the bathroom so I wouldn't have to later, limiting my sleep. I started on 25mg but quickly grew an immunity to it, and am now at 150mg with only ever experiencing severe dry mouth and constipation (expected, better not going then always having too). If I forget to the take the medicine before bed though the next morning I go through what I assume are withdraws and feel absolutely horrible to the point I just want to stay in bed. The medicine has absolutely changed my life, I no longer suffer from IBS nor my mild insomnia.

As far as my sleep goes, it doesn't really help me sleep any better (doesn't make it worse either), but I do wake up feeling well-rested. The best part about it? For me, it has decreased my appetite so much that I haven't eaten a meal in 4 days (I just started taking it a week ago). I have to force myself to eat a cracker or a piece of bread just so I have something in my stomach. I have lost 7 pounds in a week!! I know it's not the best way to lose weight, but why fight it? I need to lose 25 pounds anyway! I don't know if it actually helps with depression, but if I lose 25 pounds I probably won't be so depressed anymore.

86$Condition: Other$2/27/2009 5:54:12 PM$Reviewer: Cybil, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$3$"Imipramine was prescribed as last resort for me  when I suffered cystitis-like symptoms which often left me immobilised after urninating...I could not walk!  This medical condition was impacting upon my life in a way that left me unable to plan activities and any social occasions; often bed requirement was required following a visit to the loo! Not ideal for a teacher! 
Initially ...and for just under 5 years, Imipramine has been a life saver, however the side-effects , the dreadful dry mouth, the sluggish mental ability and hoarse voice, has forced me now in to recently giving up the medication. Almost immediately I have returned to a clear-thinking individual; I have rediscovered my vocabulary; my voice sounds less hoarse as the vocal tract is not dried out and most importantly of all...so far...I have not had a cystitis flare-up. I was on 75mg per night and started at 25mg per week building up over three weeks before I gained physical benefit from the medication. I have maintained this level of medication occasionally increasing it, when high levels of stressful episodes were imminent.
Throughout this I have taken laxatives to maintain a bowel movement. 
This medication should be valued, but used with intelligence. It has side-effects which at times I thought were worse than the condition...it is a medication which has very personal side effects and it needs a user to monitor well-being versus side  effects...whatever they may be. Don't dismiss it because of the side-effects but don't let the side effects take over your life either.       "

Allergy tests showed no cause (possibly stress/trauma related) though I suffered panic attacks/anxiety yrs. before. After a rough pregnancy, with diabetes, high blood pressure, toximia, I think that started a cycle of inflammatory issues. After trying several antihistimines for the hives, I eventually tried Imipramine HCL; it made me somewhat drowsy and constipated, dry mouth, but really helped with any anxiety, especially at suppressing the hives--I couldnt work without it. within the first year of taking it, I had a minorly physical job 2 days a week, at age 33, was having sudden hot flashes, sweating, heart pounding, lasting up to 20 min. I would have to sit down at my job until it went away. Quite scary, but every time I asked a dr. if I could try something else, they would say ""As rare and extreme as this hives is, if you found something that WORKS, stick with it!"" I felt I had no choice. It affected my memory, I felt light-headed, groggy much of the time, and still struggled to work reliably. After 15 yrs., reaching age 50, more recent jobs that were more physical caused profuse sweating, and I thought it was true hot flashes. After I lost 2 jobs, I decided to cut way back on it, to see if I still had hives, which I would try to do once a yr. or so, and it was gone!! When I got off the Imipramine, the sweating and hot flashes were nearly COMPLETELY GONE, I had to get USED TO being CHILLED at times--I could actually wear sweaters again, my memory and mind was clearing, I felt like someone lifted a huge wet wool blanket off of me!! Now Im struggling with digestive problems, severe IBS; apparently my system got SO used to being stopped up and sluggish, even after my gall bladder removed, once off of it, my intestines got really sensitive, without the real drying effects slowing it down, and 3 months off the drug, still trying to change my diet and habits, taking fiber pills helps."
