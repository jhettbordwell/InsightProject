I took Wellbutrin XL for only 5 days. I soon developed odd patches on my skin resembling abrasions and pinpoint bleeding. I developed severe itching, primarily at night, that lasted for a month-and-a-half. Now, a full three months later, my skin still exhibits markedly slower healing from cuts and abrasions. 

If you have had skin problems and/or itching as a result of taking Wellbutrin XL (also called Bupropion XR) and would like to add your name to a Class Action suit against the makers of it, please email me at [email protected] Put the word “itching” in the subject line.

I had to organize a Class Action suit against a major US automaker in 2010 and succeeded. We will get results.

1$Condition: Depression$3/12/2019 11:49:58 AM$Reviewer: Bipolar2coolforschool, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$"I have bipolar II and after a series of failed drugs, I was prescribed quetiapine (that's a whole other message board) and bupropion. 

I was on Activas bupropion 150 XL for about six weeks. It stabilized me, but I was still depressed - but functioning. Side effects - waking up early, feeling like a zombie, loss of appetite - went away within that time period. 

I've now been on Par Pharmaceutical's bupropion 300 XL for about a month. Side effects are irritability and jitters, but I'm hoping those go away. I tried Activas 300 XL - oval pills - and it seemed to dump a large portion of the medication about two hours after taking it, giving me a zombie effect. It also gave me a headache. Those things may have gone away with time, but I switched back to Par. 

Overall I'm content and my depression is completely gone."
2$Condition: Depression$2/25/2019 7:05:12 AM$Reviewer: Warox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"Firstly note this medicine not for everyone. Everyone's brain chemestry is different. It is one of the most popular and commonly used antidepressant due to it's general efficiency and fewer shitty side effects than other drugs. Personally, two weeks after starting 150mg bupropion, I'm already starting to feel somewhat better overall.

The way I've understood this drug works is by preventing the recapture of dopamine and noradrenaline. This leads to a slow but steady build up of those two chemicals in the brain. That' why the full efficiency of this drug is obtained a few weeks later after starting taking it. Dopamine is the feel good reward chemical which makes you feel slightly happier in general and makes you want to do things more since you're reward signal in the brain is ""boosted"". Not absolutely sur about the noradrenaline part but I think it's from this chemical adrenaline comes from. This could explain why this drug makes you more awake and energized than normally. Not sure but dopamine too i think helps keep awake. Anyways, even the specialists aren't exactly sure HOW antidepressants exactly works. 

 So far for me the first few days I felt a little ""something"" positively different about how I felt in general. I've been sadly having trouble to feel emotions and happyness for a very long time. Feel like a machine that mainly works eats and sleep. Now I'm starting to have more energy, want to do more things and actually enjoy myself sometimes. Better mood. I actually smile because I feel like it sometimes instead of smiling because I'M supposed to. Don't oversleep anymore. More sociable. Better attention and focus. Think better. Got some libido back. Losing fat and gaining muscle since im more active. Seems I'm actually starting to enjoy life a little. So far the pros are better than cons. Insomnia (i need seroquel to sleep well), rise in anxiety are the two downsides. A bit worst in the begining but it lessens. Got used to it. Definately worth it for me."
3$Condition: Depression$1/27/2019 9:35:32 PM$Reviewer: DelCarmem, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$This medication worked very well for me. I had never taken anti depressants and my doctor recommended this one. It really made a huge difference in my mood and outlook, however it had one unbearable side effect for me. It made me soooooo itchy. I was losing my mind. I tried everything possible to control the itching, different soap, shower water filter, cortisone creams, numbing cream, ice..  nothing helped. I really wanted to stay on it and did my best to see if the side effect went away but it was excruciating.  As soon as I stopped it within a week it was better. But here I am almost 3 weeks after my last pill and I still get an itch attack all of a sudden Iâ??m the evening or the morning. I decided to write this down because two doctors told me this was an uncommon side effect for this medication and that maybe it was something else, but it definitely was the meds.

Went from size 10 Miss to size 04, not intentionally. Can't put weight on although I've been eating fatty stuff and protein drinks. Was on 150mg once a day  but it did not significantly decrease depression but caused rapid alarming weight loss. Dr tells me that is not due to medicine but stress associated  with upcoming divorce. Dr increased my dose this past week to 300mg at night. My lab work is on Wednesday  and I will be asking Dr  to switch my medicine.

I have been dealing with anxiety for many years, but this drug made it 100x worse!

I put up with the sexual dysfunction but the nightmares got the better of me when I couldn't tell real from dreams.  I dove into work and just made myself forget about love. Bt the dreams...so they switched to zoloft which was not much better than prozac. Then switched to welbutrin.  It worked good enough, and I was glad to not have those horrible dreams and to get my libido back... but... I could not sleep with this.  I'm running on 4-5 hours sleep a night.  Curiously enough my dentist told me it was like an amphetamine!  But after being on this one year... it is not working anymore.  I'm crying alot, getting very irritable, yelling at people, angry, hopeless, unlovable... Its just plain not working for me at all.  I dont know if it is the lack of sleep or what.  but I cant do this anymore.  I dont know what to do now.  Called doc and I guess I have to go through the 6-week weaning off period to try yet another drug.  How am I supposed to work and be normal when I am not? I just want to feel normal without bad side effects.  I wonder why that is just not possible for me to attain normalcy? See? depression. everything is hopeless for me.

For the first month the drug worked great, but shortly after I stated experiencing horrible sexual side effects. The medication decreases sensation,vaginal lubrication, and makes it almost impossible to orgasm. My dr assured me that this wouldn't happen, but unfortunately my body responded differently than most of the population. Needless to say I've stopped taking the medication, which is sad because a lost so much weight while on it.

At first it gave me energy and I wasn’t depressed any more. My negative thoughts about myself were lessened. Soon after though I started feeling energetic and unable to sleep. My chest, throat and esophagus felt tight, like I couldn’t breath when laying in bed.  Then I got a severe headache, joint pain, fever nausea, and sore throat. I felt so awful. I will never take this again.

I usually take 150mg daily, but in mid-winter I take 300mg and sometimes I can go off it completely in the summer. It depends on stress, exposure to sunlight, exercise. The only lasting side effect is excessive sweating when working out, but I put up with it because other anti-depressants have much worse side effects.

I have had severe depression for about 10 years. Had been on prozac and effexor before wellbutrin. They both worked, but not even close to how the wellbutrin is helping me! I'm taking 300mg XL per day.

I felt so much happier even on day 1...  I couldn't believe how happy I was & still am feeling! I didn't know it was possible for a person to even feel this happy! (Not to mention the increased sex drive)!  ??

I also have severe fibromyalgia & social anxiety. Wellbutrin has helped all of it! I knew my effexor was not working for me any longer, since I had been on it for 3 years already.

I found myself gradually staying home from functions I would normally attend, was EXTREMELY fatigued & just wanted to stay in bed all day. My family told me I was very irritable. I didn't see it. I first had my hormone levels checked to see if that was the problem, The hormones were all normal.I called my psychiatrist the next day and started on the wellbutrin.

My family and I noticed a difference immediately, I was laughing again! It has given me an enormous energy boost! I have gotten things done that I've been meaning to do for the last couple of years, but could never do because of the lack of energy & motivation. I even started a part time job! It has suppressed my appetite, which I'm excited about, since I need to lose some weight.

I have never been happier than I am now! Please realize though that all medications don't work for EVERY person... our brain chemistries are all different, but I would most definitely give it a try! I wish you all the best & hope it works as well for you as it has for me.

There were minor side effects the first couple of weeks, (headaches & insomnia) but they went away and I couldn't be more happy or thankful for how much Wellbutrin has helped me!"
19$Condition: Depression$8/14/2016 8:26:15 PM$Reviewer: mk, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have had three episodes of depression in my life.  Each were event caused.  I was 35 for the first episode and the doctor gave me Wellbutrin.  It worked great and there were no side effects.   It stopped the deep sadness I felt.   The situation still stunk, but at least I was not a weeping mess.  I needed it for six months. The next event happened at age 47.  Wellbutrin helped again.  More bad news at 49 with depression and anxiety this time.  Wellbutrin is keeping me calm and less sad.  No side effects.
20$Condition: Depression$8/6/2016 1:32:17 PM$Reviewer: Lucky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was hospitalized for severe depression and anxiety almost two years ago. The doctor immediately started me on a low dose of Wellbutrin (the generic type), and upped it to 300mg before I was released. I went through four other medications for anxiety, since Wellbutrin often does not treat both depression and anxiety. Finally, I ended up with Zoloft, which also enhances the effect of Wellbutrin. Over months of treatment, the Wellbutrin was amazing! It lifted my mood, raised my energy, increased my focus, evened out my appetite, reduced my smoking, and increased my metabolism. With diet and exorcise on Wellbutrin, I was able to lose 50 lbs. Usually my metabolism is so low that I can eat olny salad with steady activity and lose nothing. So getting back down to a normal weight (122 lbs at 5'5"") was amazing. 
After 15 months of treatment, I wanted to wean off of the medications to see how I would do. I had been at the maximum does of 450mg of Wellbutrin and 200mg of Zoloft daily. After 5 months of no medication, I was spiraling down back to where I had started. It was hard to climb back out of that hole, but at least this time I knew the footing. I made an appointment with my doctor, and in the mean time, wanted to start back on the lowest dose of the pills I still had. Not expired, my prescription, all legal. The PROBLEM came when I mistook the dosage for each Wellbutrin pill, thinking they were 50mg each. Well, no, they were 150mg each, and I took three. Really, really bad idea. I felt the effects immediately, felt great, did work, a little shaky, knew I shouldn't drive so I didn't. That night, I got two hours of sleep. Took the same amount the next day, then realized my mistake. I haven't slept in three nights. I'm staying hydrated and being careful, not taking any more, but the point is: When taken correctly, it can amazing! DO NOT take more than directed!"
21$Condition: Depression$7/26/2016 11:41:58 AM$Reviewer: zarer77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been slightly depressed for about 10 years, but never thought I needed medication.  After a traumatic event 6 months ago I was sick of crying, no motivation, anxiety, etc. I finally went to my family doctor she prescribed me Zoloft, and hydroxozine for anxiety. I noticed my depression and crying for no reason had subsided, but I became depressed in a different way because it made me so tired I could physically not do anything besides work. She switched me to Celexa and Cymbalta where I had the same problem and could hardly make it through a work day I was sleeping in my car at lunch.  About to give up I went to a Psychiatrist who recommended the generic wellbutrin. I started at 150mgXL for one week noticed absolutely no side effects.  The 8th day I started 300mg and noticed the energy a few hours later. I went grocery shopping, cleaned entire house, etc WILLINGLY.  Normally it would take me a week to have enough motivation to do one of these things. I almost cried I was so happy. I actually sat down and had a conversation with my boyfriend smiling and laughing- he looked at me crazy like he did not know how to respond because I have not been that way in so long. Now, I have only been taking it such a short time, but will definitely try 4-6 weeks for full effect.  I have had mild headaches (I had some before) a little dry mouth, and increased sex drive/orgasm. So far I am just thankful that it has put hope back in my life.

I talked to my Doctor and he proscribed Wellbutrin. Overnight I felt amazing, I felt like my older self. In a year i'd lost 50 pounds, 200lbs down to 150lbs. I've had no side effects except I have dizzy spells occasionally if I stand up to fast. I'm so glad I take Wellbutrin, it changed my life. On a side note I take a bunch of anti allergen medications as well and if I forget to take my medications at night, the next day I feel absolutely awful.

I had depression. It took all of my energy for the day to answer one email, and I would cry for no reason often. But after three weeks of Wellbutrin 150XL, I was whistling tunes I hadn't in years, and I was happy and energetic for the first time since I was a kid. At the same time, though, it's like my conscience switched off. I immediately started cheating on my wife of 9 years. Repeated hookups again and again with other men. I would prowl around town, horny out of my mind. It was like I was high. I would never have acted on these impulses before, not in a million years. Concerned that I was bipolar, I told my doctor and he screened me, asking if I was buying stuff. No? Then it must be because I was happier and more confident now. I should have insisted something was wrong, but the drug made me not care, plus my happiness made marriage great and she had no idea. I just wanted to keep going. That was 10 months ago. IF YOU GET IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOUR GET OFF OF IT BEFORE IT WRECKS YOUR LIFE. I hate what I've become. I don't know what's going to happen when I get off this cursed drug. I'm afraid all the time. And I'm still doing it.

I was severely depressed, hardly left the house because of low energy, lack of focus, and stress.  I had been through a job loss and marital problems that led to severe depression.  When I started the drug it gave me more energy and I felt more ""alive"".  I had a slight headache and a some insomnia at first but that got better after a few days.  I was somewhat short tempered at times but that is most likely the release of all the pent up frustration I had been harboring while depressed.  It seemed to increase my sex drive and actually the side effects felt like Viagra in that I had a flushed face and slightly fast heartbeat along with the mild headache.  I am hoping that my better moods continue and that I can get back to enjoying my life and being more optimistic about the future."

After 3 years I started having extreme woozy/lightheaded spells that were ruining my life. Everyone kept blaming it on my anxiety. After three years of hating life I went off of wellbutrin. It took over 30 days before I even started to see relief, but by the 90 day mark I was free from those spells. I have my life back. It would not have gone away. Wellbutrin helps with the kind of depression where you have NO motivation and crave sugar. It will make you dehydrated, constipated, edgy, and a light sleeper that only needs about 6 hours per night. It isn't good for anxiety and will not help it. During the adjustment period you could lose about 10 lbs and have the most vivid nightmares ever. This drug will stop working for you. At first you can be so numb but after awhile you start to feel very depressed again. It's not until you go off of it do you realize that it was helping. It really only seems to be popular because of the lack of weight gain and no decrease in your sex drive. Those are really the only positive things but you just have to figure out if the other side effects are worth it.

In the past I had a history of starting an antidepressant when things got really bad for me, noticed myself improving then gradually stopped taking it...then gradually fell back into the dark hole that felt impossible to get out of.  I have been taking different doses of Prozac for about the last 6 years ( which I also love when I stay on it ! ) and Celexa before that.. ( made me wayy too sleepy, counterproductive because when i'm depressed ALL i do is sleep ). This last time around, I had finally had enough, I wanted to pull myself together and stay on the medicine once and for all ( hey your Brain is an organ, and if you need medication stay on it! feeling great means it is working :) ) I went back on my Prozac ( 40 mg in Feb. when my depression was at it's worst, and anxiety= vicious cycle) and slowly noticed it taking effect, but not as effective as it was. My Dr. added the Wellbutrin ( 100 mg at first, now 200 ) and within 1-2 weeks I felt better than I have ever, ever. My motivation is back, determination, focus, energy, self worth and purpose all have returned, and gone are the days i feel lost, exhausted, and like a total piece of shit.  Talk to your Dr.! With these meds I've had a whole life style change, I was able to lose 30 pounds and counting, my binge emotional eating has subsided, i work out, went back to school and work like 50 hours a week! I eat great, natural, and organic foods that help fuel my body and mind, and do yoga to center myself.  ALl i needed was that little push, and at almost 30 I'm finally a better version of myself. Hang in there!!! I promise there is hope!

37$Condition: Depression$1/29/2015 11:50:38 PM$Reviewer: Meligraphics, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$4$"I just started taking Wellbutrin, and obviously should have started it many years ago. I believe its going to save my life. 

Unfortunately I have made some poor decisions over the years, and being depressed so much seems obvious to me now, was a huge part of those poor decisions(as well as evidence in journals, and doctor notes to prove depression was ""at fault"").  I guess better late than never.  Its a relief to feel better, not cry every day, to feel good, or at least normal about yourself.

The side effects are with me, but I don't care! Just try to get on it slower if possible.  Don't cut the pills in half, I made that mistake, it can cause an overdose or seizures. I was lucky and wised up on that.

The reviews on this page have helped me a lot, and I want to thank everyone for helping, and the website for making this available.

I am 52 yrs old now, maybe now I can make better decisions, act better, listen better, whine less, focus more, eat less, care more, and be more appealing to myself and others.  Its amazing how so many things can be tied to and capable of working for you, when you get the help.

I hope you get the help sooner than I did, I waited way too many years to get this help, don't wait, at least give it a try."

I was a wreck, uncontrollable crying, anger, moodiness. Dropped back down to 75, which is perfect for me.  I feel bad for the other posters who had trouble with the mood symptoms.  It sounds like the doctor prescribed too high a dose.  Don't give up on it until you try a lower dose.  It works quite well.

Around the third or fourth week of Wellbutrin my excessive sleepiness had dissapated and a I experienced much better focus and attention. I no longer needed Adderral to remain focused and alert. At approximately week seven the cloud of depression was gone and I feel able to work on the stressors in my life without feeling overwhelmed and exhausted and impatient. No sexual side effects. The benefit has been subtle over time yet 
significant. "

Because of this accident, I suffered severe financial problems and major depression issues. I started seeing a Psychiatrist who prescribed Wellbutrin 150 Mg per day. (I was on Zoloft for 8 years prior to car accident) The first few days I was very jittery and had some bad anxiety. I felt like I was on speed. I then had massive insomnia for first 4-6 days. I also noticed headaches coming and going for first few weeks, but that has gotten a lot better.  THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS, so if there's any advice or comments I can give, it would be to stick out the side effects for first few weeks. It will be worth the wait. This drug has changed my life in such a positive way. I began to get my energy back, sex life got 10 X better and I felt the way I did in my 20's. It's only helped my relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years and my 2 children.

I tried Celexa & EFfexor & quit them immediately due to side effects. I had to switch taking Wellbutrin in the morning bc at night it kept me awake & woke me often. I'm also a smoker & it has cut that back significantly. I had no appetite issues & no change in sex drive. I believe it helps get me up each day & keeps my emotions in better check. I am going through something that causes anger & sadness often. Lots of rants & crying spells but they have subsided & when they do happen it's less intense. It did cause me to be more anxious & I deal with high anxiety already so I am taking Busprione (15 mg 3x/day) on days my anxiety is higher but don't take it every day. 
My ONLY gripe is that on the 300 mg I feel as if my throat is closed all day. It's hard to swallow & feel l have to take deep breaths often. When my anxixety is high, it's much worse, sometimes nearly intolerable. BUT bc I feel it has helped me mood wise, I keep taking it. I'm tired of being a drug guinea pig & hope that this is temporary as I work through my situation. Hoping in time I can reduce back to 150 mg bc I didn't have the throat issue when I took that amount but for now I feel I need the 300 mg. "

However, I also noticed that I was able to keep awake, and pay better attention in my classes (which has been a problem for me for 6 years or so).

Never as long as I can recall into early childhood able to express any positive emotions. As my mother would say instead of a normal young child craving accolades for a job well,hug and kisses I would push her away furious at the thought. Also refusal to conform for treats at friends or relatives houses. I would rather go without cake and ice cream at a bday party than to say please and thank you. Not to be stubborn but would not conform. Most importantly and the root of my issue is still until as od these last few days have I ever, ever EVER uttered the words I Love You. A very painful inner conflict having been married for going on 21 years with 4 children with all other 5 members saying it freely to everyone including to me but have never have had it said by myself. Since my starting this drug I not only have came out from my closed off hidden from letting others know my heart but Im worse than a love sick child with my wife having her almost in tears to finally hear it and now multiple times a day to her unabated......this being said baby steps Im working on it with my children.

I'd had minor bouts of it, but hadn't suffered from it until a traumatic business occurence when I was 50, and I fell into it, deep. I'd tried SSRI's in the past and HATED them --- the sexual side-effects are horrible!! My sister had great success with Wellbutrin, so my doctor prescribed it. Started on 150mg XL. It is a miracle!! I've had no side effects whatsoever. I came out of my deep funk. After 4 months I went up to 300mg XL. I've lost weight, have fantastic sex, and feel better about myself. It's still a struggle, but this drug has helped me out SO SO MUCH!!!

I love love love this drug. I take 300mg once a day (I have friends who took lower doses, and it didn't work for them) and the first time I took it, I immediately felt better. I actually got a buzz from it the first time-like way too much coffee-but that disappeared the next day. I have no trouble sleeping while taking it, but it does give me constipation, to a degree-not too bad though. It also increases sexual desire, to a degree that might make it a woman's Viagra. Everyone's body chemistry is different, but I went from being a depressed, irritable witch, to being happy and mellow. I feel peppy, not terribly hungry, and happy. That's a big improvement, but I was never exceedingly depressed, except episodically, so I don't know if it's strong enough for someone with severe depression. It works for me though, and I really like taking it.

I'm currently on generic Wellbutrin SR, 150 mg twice a day (8 hrs apart). I have been on this medication for 4 weeks now, following a 2 week horror period on Lexapro. Wellbutrin isn't supposed to be effective immediately, but when I started it, I noticed a huge increase in energy and my ability to pay attention, my thoughts felt less cloudy and I felt more optimistic everyday. Those feelings faded a little after about 4 or 5 days (likely a placebo effect).
I have found that drinking alcohol while on this medication makes me turn into a totally awful person to be around. I would get mad at the slightest thing and be completely unable to get over it, no matter how hard my partner tried to help. I would basically shut down for the night if I drank, and would feel depressed for 2-3 days afterward as well.
I have been a self-harmer for about 6 or 7 years. While on this medication, I have only cut twice, but have become much more optimistic that I can stop my addiction to self-harm. I feel like life is more worth living in general and I tend to have a more positive outlook, even when there is some issue at hand. I don't feel like everything that goes wrong is my fault and I feel like I've become more productive and feel much more rewarded when I complete things. 
One other positive of this medication is that it has really decreased my appetite. I'm only slightly overweight at 5'4"" and about 145-150 lbs, but I used to eat all the time and now I don't usually feel like I'm hungry, even when I go half the day without eating. I eat more for taste and for health now than out of boredom. 
Overall I've had a pretty positive experience, and I will likely be switching to the extended release, 300 mg once a day the next time I see my doctor. "

Wellbutrin has worked well for me. However, has anyone had a very slight sore throat or a cold-like nasal feeling or a chesty cough as a suspected side effect of Wellbutrin? Am on 150 mg a day together with 100 mg of Sertraline. I have been on Wellbutrin for around five months and my symptoms have been with me for a similar period. One website indicated that 11% of side effects from Wellbutrin are sore throats. I have had other side effects e.g. constipation although this only lasted for say, 2-3 weeks. 

It would be helpful to know.

I also have Graves' Disease and had my thyroid removed, that resulted in a paralyzed vocal cord which I have just had surgery to repair. I also have been through menopause. My doctor decided to change me from Zoloft to Wellbutrin 2 weeks ago.  The first few days I felt much better - more energy but  able to sleep better than I had in years. After the first week I was to increase to twice daily. Since then I have noticed dizziness that last all the time, unable to think clearly, words not coming out right,  hot flashes, and still having depression and crying spells at night time.

At first, I had typical side effects and managed well - dry mouth, metallic taste in my mouth, trouble sleeping. I did experience the benefits of the medication almost immediately after starting to include increased energy. However, on the seventh day after the second dose, I had an allergic reaction about three hours later - due to, according to the doctor, the compounding effect of the medication. I began feeling itchy and had problems with my throat. I could breath and swallow, but my throat felt constricted and like I had a lump in the back. It was very scary and caused me to panic. I called emergency and saw my doctor, who discontinued the medication immediately. My throat is fine, but I still feel a little itchy. That will pass as the medication gets out of my system.

I share this because while allergies are rare, they can happen and if they do, call your doctor immediately. I know that everyone reacts to medications differently and am hopeful that my experience is unique and that others have a positive experience.

Though I am experiencing some mild side effects (memory issues, weird taste in my mouth, some muscle pain in my neck and restlessness at night) overall I do feel it is helping. Due to menopause issues, I was dealing with severe depression and anxiety. The anxiety is completely gone, even in this short amount of time!  I still experience the depression, however it is less than it was. Also, the intense cravings for sweets is gone, though I have not lost weight as others have on Wellbutrin.  I'm assuming it (the lessening of the depression) will continue to improve as the weeks go by. I know it takes a while for the clinical dosage to really start working. Considering the good experience I'm already having, I will continue with Wellbutrin. My doctor is working closely with me to make sure all goes well. I don't always handle medications well so we will see how this goes. I have not experienced the increased sexual desire that others talk about and quite honestly, I am hoping and praying that I  never do!

I had to go back to 150 mg. because of severe dry mouth at the higher dose that didn't go away even though I gave it plenty of time (6 months). It caused painful gums(gum disease). I need the higher dose, but won't risk getting gum disease. That's too bad because it's good for energy and it doesn't effect your sex life like other antidepressants. I still take it because the psych says I need an ""add-on"" drug to make my other psych meds more effective (to ""augment"" my treatment). She actually calls my drugs of lamictal, cymbalta and wellbutrin a ""cocktail."" And I don't drink! I trust and respect my psych, but this really made me laugh. Are there any other non-drinkers out there taking a cocktail every morning?"

I don't know if I have plateaued again, or if I am having some SAD, but the Dr. is boosting the Paxil with a very low dose of Buproprion - 50mg. every morning.  It has worked great.  I have been on it for about 5 weeks.  The only issue is that over the last few days I have been experiencing extreme muscle soreness/stiffness and joint pain/stiffness.  If it doesn't go away, I will have to stop the med.  Having just read a lot of the other reviews, I realize that I am a bit foggy in the morning, I experience dizziness for about 1/2 hour, an hour or so after taking it, and I am having trouble spelling!  I have lots of energy and have gotten more creative and am getting unfinished projects done.  I do notice that I am talking a lot.

I had nearly every side effect possible. I was always nauseous, was very shaky, had ringing in the ears, and was disgusted by food. I had to force myself to eat, would eat a few bites and be full, and was hungry again in an hour, just to repeat the cycle. I was so used to not eating that much that one day I had completely forgotten to eat. By 9pm I realized it, forced some soup down, and puked it up within 2 hours. I started with 150mg and eventually up-ed it to 300mg. I wanted so much for it to work. After 5 months of no results I decided to go off of it. I had lost the weight I wanted, but was continuing to lose weight at a dangerous rate. I don't blame the drug; everyone's body is different and will have different reactions. Just wish it would have worked for me! Good luck to everyone and I hope you have better results than I did.

I had been depressed, suffered from anxiety and general unhappiness.  Within days I could feel the fog in my brain start to lift.  Was able to go on planned vacation, which I was going to cancel, and had a wonderful time.  This drug, added to my Effexor, has allowed me to feel happy and want to do things instead of staying home and not wanting to go out.  Depression/anxiety is very cruel and unless someone has walked in our shoes they have no idea how incapacitating it can be.

Paxil was my 1st poison, but the mental fog was too much for me. Tried Lexapro and Celexa for relapses, but.. didn't work. They just kept me 'comfortably numb' enough to get on with my life. Wellbutrin, on the other hand, contributed to a positive change in my outlook. I'm about to finish a graduate program for a professional degree I used to think was way beyond my capabilities. In addition to the degree, I'm in a fairly stable & supportive relationship (not the abusive, drunken ones of my youth), and have picked up 5K's as a recent hobby. Lost about 30 lbs within the 1st year. 
My major downfall is remembering to take my meds everyday at the same time. When I do forget, it takes about 48 hours for the creepy crawling feelings to start clouding my mind, and those are hard for me to shake off. About 4 months ago, I was struggling with my need to take antidepressants, and convinced myself that I could do just fine without any help from therapy + meds. Needless to say, I had a major meltdown within days that took 2 1/2 months of work to finally get ahead. 
Now, 5 weeks back on generic bupropion, I'm realizing the benefits I was afforded with this treatment - alert, focused, driven, confident - I felt more like the person I want to be, plus I have a healthy sex drive. Also, I never, ever want to go through withdrawal again, so I'm declining a recent Rx for Pristiq and all SSRI/SNRIs for as long as possible. I take 2 x 150mg pills everyday before 12pm, to take advantage of the elevated mood + energy boost and ability to really sleep afterwards. I still have my low moments, but I do recover with learned techniques & support."

Then about 2 maybe 2 1/2 months into the 450mg daily, I woke up one day and started doing my 'honey do's (like always), but this time, i noticed it was almost noon and I hadn't lit a cigarette all day! Well dam, (i'm thinking) I haven't even wanted one all day. I didn't quit all at once. I went from a pack a day to 1/2 pack. THAT DAY. stayed with 1/2 pack  for about a week. Maybe.  From there, i went from 1/2pack 10 a day to 8 and then 7. From 7 to 5, then down to 4 a day. I kinda go stuck of 3 for a few more days than i thought I would but, i climbed the hill anyways and i was now at two a day. For a few days. And then 1. a day. For a few days. Then finally, I had one last cigarette in my car and i smoked it maybe 1/2 down,...and pitched it out the window.  From day one until I lit my last one was about 4 weeks.  But it wasn't the nicotine i was having to break myself from. The Wellbutrin had completely removed all urges and cravings for nicotine. The hardest part with stopping to smoke with Wellbutrin,was the 'breaking' of my old habits. I was well on my way of ridding myself of smoking, My only obstacle was ""what to do with my hands???"" For so long, if i  got on the phone, lite it up. ON the computer, lite it up. Driving down the road in my car,...lite it up. sitting on the front deck, watch the birds fly by,...lite it up! But after I got past all that 'easy' stuff, i was and AM on my way to a much healthier body. For my Grandchildren sake. It's been 5 months this past March 5th. I'm really, really proud of myself. "

I feel great, can control my eating, I'm not lashing out/irritable, and am smiling and laughing again. I can't believe how well this med works for me. I've tried tricyclics and SSRIs to no avail.
If you are depressed with overeating, irritability, and excess sleepiness, try this. If you have a tendency to addictive behaviors, try this.
If you are anxious, can't sleep, have lost weight, or have high blood pressure - do not take this med. It will make things worse.
And the generics made by MYLAN were WORTHLESS for me. Once I switched to the brand name, I started getting better."

I have more energy, feel more alert and wake up so much easier than I have my whole life.. I've never been a morning person. I had ""de ja vue"" seizures several years ago but this has not brought them back.

I am working full-time, but it is difficult due to the toll the depression and GAD has taken on my memory and concentration.  I'm taking 300 mg Wellbutrin, 100 mg Trazadone, and .05 Xanax as needed for anxiety/panic attacks.  I've tried almost every other anti-depressant - alone and in conjunction with Wellbutrin - and couldn't handle the side effects due to a medical disorder that I also have.  I thought Wellbutrin was a decent compromise - I still have bad days and crying spells, but I wasn't aware of any side effects.  HOWEVER... Wellbutrin's side effects crept up on me.  I have very, very thin hair now.  And in just the past two months I have a new side effect -- the inner tops of my ears have turned a dusky green/blue shade.  Anyone else with this side effect?  My doctor doesn't know what to make of it.  I attribute it to the Wellbutrin because my daughter also takes it, at the 450 mg level, and her ears started turning before mine did.  This is the only med we have in common.

For some reason docs always prescribe anti-depressents, which usually make me VERY depressed. I hate having to choose between panic attacks and morbid depression. Finally found that tiny amounts of lorazepam (.5mg) as needed help stop most panic attacks, but anxiety was still constant. Doc thought wellbutrin might help, since SSRI's etc. just kill me with depression. She thought since I seem compulsively anxious, and wellbutrin is sometimes prescribed for OCD, it was worth a try. First two weeks I felt much better, but eventually the dose at 150mg./day made me desperately depressed. But a month after I stopped, I was back to feeling out of my skin. So now the past 3 weeks I take 1/2 of a 75 mg. pill of buproprion twice per day, morning and mid-afternoon. I feel so much better! And I've already lost 3 pounds, don't feel either anxious or depressed, just basically calm. Can't tell you what a relief that is. I am thirsty and have some constipation, but those side-effects are worth it. I am very sensitive to medications, and this small dosing is working for me. For me, reducing dosage was the key.

Adding this medication has given me the first sustained relief I have had from depression.  I have been diagnosed with long-term low level depression.  I have had some sleep disturbance and some joint aches.  They have varied in intensity and if the joint aches had not improved my doctor would probably have removed me from the medication.  But I would gladly lose a little sleep in order to finally know what it feels like to not be depressed.  It is wonderful and even great to be tired because of a little loss of sleep rather than just plain tired of life and dragging through my days.

Although I was seeing a psychiatrist I was drinking, smoking, gambling, mildly depressed and had constant mood swings. Within a month of taking this medicine all my addictions were gone. I just don't have the strong urges anymore and can rationalize and control my decisions. I don't look at food the same either sometimes I just don't eat at all (no hunger pains). The best thing about the medicine is that I have lost 20 pounds with exercise. The worse thing is that I have developed an addiction to sweets I didn't have before. All in all I am a better person when taking the drug even though a couple of times I have experienced a day of two of sadness but nowhere near like before. It has been seven months and I am much happier about my life. Wellbutrin is not for everyone and the side effects were very prominent for the first six weeks but went away.  Thank God for this medicine.

I was on it several years ago, with this outcome, but my doc decided to try again since I have little luch with oher types of meds. I took one dose over the weekend (half of a 75mg tab) and have a migraine again. I'm really sensitive to med side effects, so take this with a grain of salt, but I guess it's back to square one. I had the fewest side effects, and best results with Cymbalta, but it recently lost it's effectiveness.

About a year ago my doc added Wellbutrin to my regular Zoloft. I had been taking Zoloft for several years and I believe she started it to add to my energy, as it was low, and also to possibly help reduce my appetite. I had been trying for several years to lose weight and still had carb cravings and no weight loss. The first month I took it I lost 10 pounds, and since then have lost ten more. I did feel much more energetic (not manic, but normal)and became more active and was able to get more things done in my home and elsewhere.  Not only have I been treated for serotonin deficiency (for many years)last year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, which also causes fatigue. Wellbutrin has helped, but my dosage was just increased to the highest level, so I hope it remains effective as there is no where ""higher"" to go if my body becomes accustomed to this dosage and then the drug becomes less effective than before.

It has been wonderful for depression and bulemia! When I stopped taking medication a few times over the years to see what happened the bulemia urges came back very strongly even though nothing had changed emotionally for me. This has led me to believe very strongly that bulemia is much more of a physical illness than a mental one. It has helped me more with depression than any other medication.

I had my first husband, my brother and my dad die within 3 years. Also a SPED teacher, stress and severe DDD of the lower back.  I have had 3 major back operations.  The XL has helped me not cry on the spur of the moment. I have had no ballistic moments with daughter or students. 

I have been able to get thru the day, althought it has given me a ""I don't give a sh*t"" mood at times, it is bettr than high anxiety, stress and muscle pain in the back.

I am now retired 6/08 due to the back and stress (30 years of SPED) is enough. I still am not lowering my daily dose right now. I am going thru menopause (just great) and have a new husband.

I am also taking Cymbalta 20 at night but I want to get off of that due to weight gain.

My family hid it from me that depression ran in the family. I was I had something sooner then maybe my life would have been not as stressful and muscle bound.

I was put on 75mg a day for a week and bumpped up to 150mg after a week.  During the first week I noticed I was sweating much more and actually feeling more anxious.  I thought this would go away after the first week or once I bumpped up to the higher dosage.  It didn't.  I became much more irritable and anxious.  Cryed at the littlest of things and would go off over stupid things.  I think my husband thinks I have turned into a crazy woman and he doesn't know why.  Additionally I do not sleep well.  Put a call into the doc, hope she has a solution.  I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions.

208$Condition: Depression$5/23/2010 3:35:56 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$2$Wellbutrin has certainly elevated my mood, making me a whole lot more functional. There's a couple side effects I don't like though. Under normal day-to-day activities I don't feel any dizziness, I'm a ballet dancer, and I've noticed that chaine turns and pique turns (basically spinning really fast across the floor) are markedly a lot more difficult, and sometimes I have to sit down in class because the dizziness is overwhelming. This of course is extremely frustrating, I'm one of the strongest dancers in my group, but this is holding me back. I also have a ringing in my ears. I take 150mg twice a day, and I don't like monitering the time so closely to be sure I take them on time. But at least for now, I feel much better than I did before, so I'm not ready to give up on it yet.
209$Condition: Depression$5/22/2010 10:28:56 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$3$Wellbutrin has been very effective for me in that it gives me a boost of energy, easier to get out of bed in the morning, and my social anxiety is a whole lot easier to deal with. I started taking it because my best friend died recently and I was having the most difficult time in the world getting the most basic things done, I never wanted to go out in public, it was extremely painful to do homework and go to class, etc. I've always been a bit prone to depression anyway, but this is the worst it's ever been. I used to take Zoloft, but I didn't like it for 2 reasons, firstly, it took away my sex drive, and secondly, it made me permanently in a good mood, I lost my natural range of emotion. Wellbutrin hasn't done that for me at all, I feel much more like myself, it's still possible to have a bad day and I'm ok with that, I think it's healthy. Of course I'm still grieving my friend very much, it happened only 3 months ago, so I still cry almost everyday, but now it's just for a few minutes and it doesn't completely engulf me. As for the sex drive, oh god, it's increased exponentially, sometimes I need to have sex several times a day or I go a little bit crazy, it's my boyfriend's dream come true. If I wasn't in a relationship it would be a very bad thing!! There's a couple unfortunate side effects: I've lost weight, for most people this is a much desired side effect, but I was already in perfect shape and didn't need to lose any weight. Also, I can't get to sleep at night, so my doctor also prescribed Ambien, which works just fine. The most annoying side effect is the constant ringing in my ears, most the time I can forget and not notice it, but when I do it kind of drives me crazy. And the final side effect is occasional constipation, which is always horrible for anyone. Before I go to bed I drink senna leaf tea, and that works very well, it's pretty powerful stuff.

HOWEVER, there are differences within the generic brand (Bupropion). I recently switched drug stores where my prescription is filled and received a different ""type"" of the same drug. Before I was taking 300XL of an oval-shaped white pill. The ones I just received are 300XL but round white pills. And I feel a distinct difference. 

In fact, I feel like I'm going through the initial first stages of taking the drug all over again (dry mouth, restlessness, jitters). I understand that different companies make the generics but I cannot find a site that states which company has better quality products.  

Overall, Wellbutrin is, IMO, one of the better anti-depressants out there. "

The birth control killed my sex drive, made me gain 30 pounds (I was tall and thin before), ruined my sleeping habits,  made me extra moody, and caused a lot of anxiety.  I felt like I couldn't think clearly any more and I couldn't reason as well - things just weren't connecting in my head.  I didn't want to go off the birth control because of awful cramps so my doctor started me on this drug.  The first few days I felt nauseous and my head felt like it was in a vice.  Within a few days I was feeling fine.  I can think clearly, my sleep has got better, I've gained a little of my sex drive back, and I lost some of the weight I had gained because of the birth control.  I am finally feeling more like myself.  I haven't really had any side affects except increased sensitivity to light.  I am very satisfied with it.

I'm not going to bash it- I'm sure it works for some people. However, I would like to warn people that in rare instances it can cause rash(mine resembled hives). I have been told it was Steven-Johnson's syndrome- a potentially fatal skin rash. If you do experience rash while taking this medication- STOP IT IMMEDIATELY AND CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR!

I have fought depression for 25 years.  It worsened with pregnancy and marriage to a very narcisstic partner.  I have taken many combinations of SSRIs most have been ineffective until I added Welbutrin.  I have found the generic versions to be much less effective and have had to switch to the Welbutrin SR and XL versions over time in order to continue with the brand name drug.  Overall, Welbutrin has kept me out of bed and functioning because it keeps the mental fog at bay and gives me much needed energy.  The Lexapro augments my symptoms be keeping the suicidal thoughts away and reduces my anxiety.  So, overall Welbutrin has helped me to keep functioning despite a very depressing marriage.  My new insurance will not allow me to continue my current dosages and I am afraid that things will slip back.  Does anyone have suggestions as to handle the insurance limitations?

I have to go off of it because I can not take the side effects. Dry mouth, tremors, anxiety attacks and the worst headache of my life that has not gone away in 5 days. I can not even open my right eye for more than a few seconds because the pain is so intense.

I was taking 150mg for the first week and then the second week I went up to 150 mg twice a day. My skin started to crawl, I turned mean as a snake and yelled at everyone. Forget sleeping. I have had none in over a week. All I do is lay in bed and pray that this intense pounding in my head will go away.

I know some people think that you need to give it more time, but before I was taking this I was just a bit down feeling. Now I am both depressed and anxious and in constant pain and I can't even leave my house.

So my experience with this drug has not been a good one at all. Now I am worrying about any repercussions I may have coming off of it. Hopefully, since I was not on it but a few weeks the withdrawal will not be too bad.

If you suffer from any type of anxiety disorder I would strongly suggest that you do NOT take this medication. "

I'm 18 now and am finally getting help. I've tried a few different SSRI drugs and this has seemed to work the best. But it appears that when i get mad or someone bothers me, I cant let it go. I am just so mad for the rest of the day. But a few hours later i'm ok again. And the dreams i've had are crazy. They seem so real  and scary.
246$Condition: Depression$1/14/2010 9:59:35 PM$Reviewer: xbabyx, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 14. I tried various medications with little success and many negative side-effects (weight-gain, fatigue, loss of interest/listlessness, etc). For several years i tried to handle my symptoms on my own, and I tauhgt myself how to handle my anxiety attacks but the depression and general anxiety weren't improving. Shortly before I turned 18 I began cognitive behavioral therapy once a week, and a drug regimine to control my symptoms. She prescribed a few different medications along the way to try to find one that worked for me, and one of the trials was Wellbutrin. My mother had taken it with good results, so I consented. After about 3 days I was forced to stop taking the pills - my depression and anxiety had gone from distracting but not over-whelming to literally life-threatening in 72 hours. I began self-mutilating (a habit I had managed to break myself of during my pill-less years) and became incredibly paranoid, agitated, angry, depressed, and I isolated myself from everyone and everything. Again, all within 72 hours! I am not saying this medication is horrible and should never be used by anyone, I just want to share my story so everyone knows that yes it can work (like for my mother), but it might not and might actually be dangerous (like it was for me). So always be sure to discuss any concerns you have with your doctor, beginning or continuing a medication is a big decision and it could have serious effects on your health and your life both positive or negative. Be careful, and good luck!

People: take the medication exactly as prescribed. If the side effects are too strong, tell the dr., but just because you get certain side effects at certain dosages, doesn't mean it doesn't work. This has been great for me! I was taking prozac before for YEARS. I have been taking Wellbutrin now for about 1-1/2 years. Don't review it if it's been 2 days or 2 weeks!! I've never known an anti-depressant that works that soon. Obviously, the major things you should report to your dr and maybe the dose needs to be decreased. I know, been there, done that. This decreased my apetite (I gained with prozac) and improved the sex drive (great for my marriage). I felt mental clarity and I felt like ""me"" which I hadn't felt in years. One of my first reactions was, ""Man! I missed myself."" I have so much more energy (which as you know with depression is horrible). My dr initially recommended that I work my way up to 4 a day (2 am, 2pm), but that was too much and I felt some of the things others have described (suicidal thoughts-never felt that before this). I didn't like the two doses a day. I'm only taking one and it's okay. My drs told me what symptoms I may feel and were great about following up. Yes dry mouth and funny taste, but I didn't jet the ""jitteriness"" that they said I might. Do a ""google"" search for it, there's a website where people review this after more than 2 days of taking it...lol :)"

296$Condition: Depression$9/4/2009 3:02:29 PM$Reviewer: Grateful1, 25-34 Female  (Patient) $4$5$5$In the past several months I went from nothing to several drugs. I went from not eating and losing 45lbs in 2 months to taking Pristiq which made me want to jump out of a window and was causing me to wake with extremely bad anxiety attacks(once I finally fell asleep), hyperventilate and miss work.I tried that for 2 weeks and couldn't stand it any longer. Then I was prescribed Lexapro, which after the 1st night made me feel the same way as the  Pristiq and I immediately stopped that next day. My doctor was so perplexed and gave me 150mg of Wellbutrin. I was nervous at 1st but then I made it thru 2 weeks and was feeling GREAT! My mood changed and I was actually sleeping like I haven't in YEARS!I'm now doing 300mg and can really see a difference. I think I am going to stick with this until otherwise proven different.It's all about what you can tolerate. But I've learned that if a drug like these make u feel worse... as soon as u realize it...STOP IMMEDIATELY and CALL SOMEONE WHO'S AWARE OF YOUR SITUATION!

I was stoked at first to have no side effects, but last night, I noticed what I thought was some dry mouth and when I was trying to sleep, my restless leg syndrome (which is mild) was worse, and I felt sort of like I had a mild electric current running thru my entire body. Today, the dry mouth is definitely there (bummer), and I seem to be developing a slight tremor. Also feel slightly nauseated and am having anxiety issues.  I get headaches a lot, so it's hard to tell if the headache I've got today is from the drug or just me. If this is as bad as it gets, I'll keep taking it, but the seizure thing is making me nervous, what with the feeling of an electric current running through me. I'm gonna tough it out and see if it gets better; I realize there's a period of adjustment, and I really want this drug to work, since it doesn't cause problems with weight & sex drive.  I am perimenopausal, and it might be making the hot flashes worse, though. That SUCKS.

My Dr. would like to up this dosage to 450, however I'm not comfortable with this dosage - have tried this higher does for a few days and could not handle it. With the 300 mg/ first few weeks my fingers twitched but this passed. My sex drive has improved , started going to yoga and pilates classes on a reg. bases. Stopped sneaking back to bed after dropping the kids off at school and smile more. Infact I sleep less and feel okay. Need to eat prior to taking and if I take the medication in the afternoon sleep is difficult that night. Have tried paxol - 3yrs ago for postpardom depression- symptoms - fell asleep while sitting up on the couch, that's more than just tired and lost my sex drive completely. Different people metabolize medication differently. My Dr. now wants to add Lexapro to the mix - not to sure about this which is why I'm doing my research. Also was prescribed clonazepam, however I have only taken three pills in the three months and only a half pill each time. They make me feel high; a little to good.
303$Condition: Depression$8/9/2009 11:17:42 AM$Reviewer: aer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Wellbutrin works great for me.  Once I started to feel like it wasn't working for me so my MD told me to take 200mg twice a day; but found it to cause dizziness and  a feeling like I was going to pass out, had difficulty driving.  So I cut back to 100mg bid, and those sx immediately went away.  Funny thing was, though, my MD didn't think the Wellbutrin had anything to do with it; but I had just increased the dosage about 2 weeks prior and it went away immediately when I cut back.  I made sure my MD knew this.  Then after talking to a friend, I tried 200mg at bedtime.    This works best for me. I even lost 20 lbs. I would recommend it; just make sure you are advocating for you.  If you don't agree with your dr, tell them!!

Not with Wellbutrin.  I love it.  My head is clear and I feel so much better.  There are two things that I have discovered.  One thing that I have noticed about it is that I really need to take it at the same time everyday.  I take 450mg, two pills in the morning and one in the evening.  If I'm an hour or so late on one of my doses, I get a little cranky, but it goes away shortly after I take my dose.  I also have noticed that I don't sleep as long.  But I seem to still be well rested most of the time, even when I only get 4 hours of sleep.  It beats the drowsiness I felt with the other meds.

In the past, I have been on Prozac and Paxil. Wellbutrin (incl. generics) has vastly exceeded the other drugs in effectivness for me. Tho there were side effects at one time, off and on for awhile, including some mild agitation and slight anxiety, and moderate or substantial agitation and irritation at higher dosages, they have gone away almost 100%. Currently, after re-engaging at the higher dose (150 mg SR 2x a day, previously was on 150mg SR 1x/day) I have had almost no side effects, certainly none that are substantially disturbing. And for probably the first time in 40 years I find my depressive symptoms dramatically reduced, well below what I had previously thought of as 'normal' or 'complete symptom elimination.' I now feel that I was not aware of what normal is. For me, I believe my body needed some time to acclimate to the drug. However I am so happy with current status I wished I had tried the higher dose again sooner.

Overall, it has been effective, but I have had to increase the dosage every few years.  I'm now maxxed on 450/day (and have been for about 2-3 years), and it's no longer working.  My doc and I are in search of something else.  The side effects have been minimal for me.  At first, it affected my sleep and may have caused a bit of weight loss, but that hasn't been the case for several years now.  The two biggest ones that have been consistent since day one have been decrease/loss of sex drive and occasional dry mouth.

I started out on the XL 300mg once a day but it made my stomach upset and gave me horrible headaches. So I went to my doctor after a few months and we brought it down to 200mg. I take it in the morning and it really does feel like it gives me a burst of energy. I was pretty depressed before and I had issues controlling my anger sometimes, and that is pretty much gone away now. I really like Wellbutrin. I will say though that it makes you twitch sometimes, which I don't like, but it's not noticeable most of the time.

After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

The side effects i've had is dry mouth, sore throat, and a weird taste in the morning and late at night.  I have also had insomnia but i suffered from that long before and my doctor has prescribed me a sleeping pill that works hand in hand with wellbutrin.  I have noticed that i have been feeling a little more jittery today since i have increased it but i will moniter and see if my amount is too much.  I believe that this will go away after a while though.  lastly i just wanted to add that i ate my feeling when i was depressed and while i am not horribly overweight i am a little and that was one of my biggest reasons for being depressed.  and slowly i am noticing my appitite and cravings going down and i think i am losing a little weight.  thank god!  but i recommend doing your homework and not settling but finding the right drug for you. before i took lexapro and it killed my sex life and i took cymbalta and it made me very dizzy and nauscious.  so i have finally found something that works FOR ME.

Quite basically wellbutrin saved my life as I had started cutting was a step away from suicide. Ive never felt this good before.

Didn't know people could ever feel this good, or be this focused & clear-minded.  DX over the past decade with PMDD, ADHD, Depression & SADD.  Also have Hashimoto's, and arthritis causing chronic pain & disturbed sleep.  

On Wellbutrin, I didn't implode from stress over the holidays, I'm not dwelling on things or blowing them out of proportion, anxiety is down, and my self-attitude is more positive.  I feel far more connected to people & interested in things, and I'm not procrastinating so much.

The combo of careful monitoring & tweaking my thyroid hormones, a daily progestin-only mini-pill to counter-balance high estrogen levels, a using a SADD lite box a few times a week, plus Wellbutrin, seems to be the answer for me.
  
I started on Wellbutrin @75 mg daily for 4 weeks, moved to 100 mg of XL daily 2 weeks ago.  Only side effect is getting a bit overheated while sleeping.  Normally I wear sweats, a nite cap & blanket set on High, so this is a good thing.  

Tried SSRIs - Zoloft, Prozac & Lexapro, plus Atenolol for anxiety/stress symproms, & Strattera for ADHD, but cardiovascular side effects were extreme, or left me feeling ""flat"" and apathetic, and had a major allergic reaction to Strattera."

The good effect I've had so far is a clarity in dealing with depressive thoughts and the appearance of optimistic thoughts- it has given me moreso the capacity to choose among them. The side effects, though, are infuriating. I feel constantly in a haze, dizzy, and less aware. My vision is a little blurred. I have mild headaches, but not near as bad as ones I got from SSRIs (prozac, lexapro, celexa). I feel somewhat nauseous. Reading takes a little more effort and I'm having a hard time spelling, which is really strange- not being able to pull the words forward, maybe because I have blurry vision and feel hazed over. Do the side effects normally go away with time? I hope so. I want badly for this drug to work.

I really didn't want to think I had something I couldn't take care of myself.  I started taking a low dosage of Wellbutrin (actually the generic) once a day about 2 months ago and it has worked very well for me.  The first couple of weeks I felt a little dazed and loopy and I have mild headaches every now and then but those seem to be the only side effects.  I actually lost a little weight when I started but now have come to a stand still in the weight area.  My overall mood has benefited greatly and I find myself enjoying life more and I take things in stride much better. My Dr. has suggested that I only stay on it for a few more months and then go off it which I think I will try as I hate being on a medication every day.  I do think I'll wait until Spring as I live in Upstate New York and our winters always depress me!  I found this sight because I'm looking for a cold medicine with a decongestant that I can take with Wellbutrin.  I don't like having to worry about drug interactions when I just want to take a simple cold tablet.  I would recommend this medicine to anybody that is looking for some releif from depression.

It was the one and only anti-depressant I was even willing to try based on the possible side-effects. Thankfully, it worked for me because I know many people have to try several different types of meds before they find the right one (or combination) that will work for them. I do recall that it took about six weeks for many of the initial side effects to go away; tingling sensation, bad taste in mouth, mild nausea, insomnia, etc. At the time, I was severely depressed/suicidal and suffered from PTSD as well. The initial bothersome side effects were minor compared to my critical emotional state, so I didn't focus on them too much. I'm glad for that now, because I could've easily decided that the drug wasn't working and found myself getting on the medication roller coaster that many people suffer through. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't taken this drug. The other thing that helped is that I didn't rely on medication alone. At my worst, I was seeing a counselor 2-3 times per week. Eventually, I was able to go on a very light dose (100mg 1xday), just as a preventative measure. That was 6 years ago. No recurrence of depression and I couldn't identify any side effects that are problematic if I tried. Severe, chronic depression runs in my familly and my first onset of this level of clinical depression was when I was just 9 years old, (I'm 45 now). One of my brothers was even younger. The only family members that are not struggling with severe depression are the ones that are on Wellbutrin. One family member changed meds (from Well to many others) because he couldn't deal with the insomnia and he spent the next 4 years spiraling down to the pits of hell. He went back on it 6 months ago and he's doing well. Yeah, I'm a big fan of Wellbutrin and a fortunate one at that. Good luck to those of you just embarking on recovery. My heart really goes out to you.

For the first two days it did help with the depression, but by day 3 I was totally wired: jittery, super anxious, unable to eat or sleep, felt like electricity was flowing to my finger tips, etc. I stopped and took an anti-anxiety med for a couple of days, just to be able to relax and sleep. Then switched to regular Wellbutrin: 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the afternoon. I think it does help with the depression but I still have ups and downs all the time. Overall feeling less gloomy and hopeless. However, it completely killed my appetite. I am never hungry. I try to eat more or less regularly, but have lost weight. The other side effect is almost constant, low grade nausea. My doc suggested increasing to 200 mg/day, but that just made the nausea worse. For now, I will stick with 150 mg/day. I also continue to take an anti-anxiety med (Clonazopan) at bedtime. I don't get more that 4 or 5 hours of sleep, but at least when I do wake up at 5 am, I feel calm and sometimes can even go back to sleep for a bit. I feel a bit tired during the day, but am not sure if it is because of lack of sleep or the Wellbutrin.

I have only been on it for about a month, and I am already seeing results. HOWEVER, this drug is making me lose my hair. Im a female by the way, and in most people's opinions losing your hair is worse when youre a woman. My hair started to thin at the top of my head. My whole life I have had very thick hair. My hair is completely thin now. I have a bald spot at the top of my hair. Im on the younger side for taking this drug, and i feel that by staying on this I will lose more and more.

I have tried numerous drugs but not all the drugs have worked like Wellbutrin. You have to wait a month before the drug even works so don't think it will start working right away. The side affects did hit me and I did have insomnia but I rather have that than suicidal thoughts. Overall this drug was effective but since I was under the age of 18 I had to have numerous medical tests to see if I was in danger of committing suicide.

Went off it gradually (very important) to see if I needed it.  Within 6 months all my depressive symptoms had gradually returned until they became very bad.  The last 5 of these 14 years I've used the generic which seems erratic or not quite as good.  I take much less now, 100 mg/day, NEVER within 6 hours of bedtime.   Also, if you have any manic state of mind consult your doctor and read the package  info.  Tapering off of it is important if you want to stop it and a very gradual build-up is important if you are starting it.  This helps avoid headache. 
Also, I feel that it's often hard to concentrate, comparable to a little too much caffeine and would like to know more about others' experience."

Wellbutrin makes me feel like the fog has lifted.  I start to feel so good, in fact, that I'll stop taking it, but I always crash 6-18 months later.  I hate being on any antidepressant, but this one (150mg 2x daily) has worked best for me.  Side effects (sleeplessness, dry mouth, decreased appetite, a general speedy feeling) have always been mild and and have worked themselves out in a couple of weeks.  Always drop a few pounds, too.

Starte at just one dose (150mg) in the morning with no bad physical symptoms, although emotionally I was going through hell. Ever since bumping up to the second dose of 150mg, I have constant shortness of breath. Mood is a little better, but not enough to justify this shortness of breath. Also constantly yawning, sleeping poorly (waking up too many times, extremely vivid dreams, waking up too early). Going to talk to my doctor about it. I've read that this drug works better with people who only have depression. Never knew I was overly anxious before Wellbutrin, but beginning to think it is causing me to be so.

VERY restless @ nite if I have the slightest issue on my mind, previously, I could sleep thru anything--it was my safe haven. Bit concerned about the hosility and feelings of aggitation.  Will these feelings go away soon?  I am taking 150 mg. I take it b-4 I go to bed, am wondering if I should take it first thing in the a.m.---with or w/out food?

I wanted to eat and sleep way too much on zoloft, and gained several pounds over the last 3-4 yrs .  I also have an underactive thyroid, which may have caused me to gain a lot of the weight, but I felt STARVED all the time on zoloft..don't have the starved feeling anymore, which is nice and surely will help to drop a few pounds at least. Am concerned about the comments about seizures! anyone have any insight on my concerns or questions, please email me @ [email protected]  please put wellbutrin in the subject line or I most likely will delete as junk mail.

However, it helped me to stop being a smoker of ten years, increased my libido better than ever, and completely changed my outlook on life. I used to get agitated easily, be ""blue"" frequently, critical of others, and very insecure. It made me live for today, feel beautiful as I am and not care about other's judgements, including my own of myself and other people. The pounding heart and increased heart rate at the age of 23 scared me though, would I have my first heart attack by the age of 25?

The only thing that I noticed is that I don't have the perception of being thirsty but I make sure I drink at least 8 cups of water daily.  I also have a broken sleep at night and feel the need to eat when I wake up during the night which is unusual since welbutrin is supposed to take away from your appetite.

I was put on Lexapro, and have been at a dosage of 20mg for the last 5 months.  I've felt pretty great on Lexapro, and took Clonozepam for about a month and a half to get over my panic disorder.  Over these past six months, I have had very little trouble with panic, nothing more than low level anxiety, which was easily knocked out with a Clonozepam.  Zero panic attacks though (after having them about 20 times a day).  About two weeks ago, I began to feel ""down"" again, as school came to a close, and life was about to change.  I consulted my doctor, and he placed me on Welbutrin.  150mg for a week, and then up to 300mg.  I started taking this 9 days ago, and have had more issues with anxiety and panic in those few days than in the last 6 months.

I was DESPERATE to keep my marriage intact and to be a better mother. I walked around sad all the time with no desire or motivation for no reason at all. I also seemed angry all the time. 
At first, I was a little nauseus and a tiny bit dizzy, but the thing that I noticed most was that I was restless at night and my mind RACED and I could NOT shut it down! I didn't sleep much the 1st few nights so the pharamcist reduced my dosage to 150mg per day instead of 300mg (SR, not XL) and I could sleep again, felt less dizzy and less nauseus as the days went by until eventually I felt normal except for the dry mouth that I have 24/7.
 Recently I noticed after 2 months that it seemed to wane just a little and I felt some anxiety again. I asked the pharmacist about increasing my dosage. He put me on 200 mg per day about 3 days ago and WHAM! The nuaseusness hit full force today and I threw up and felt so dizzy that the room continued to spin and I could not function. I have been drinking a lot of water to flush it out of my system and I feel better now. He is now going to let me try 200mg per day in 2 doses 12 hours apart instead of just one big 200 mg dose all at one time.(I weigh less than 120 lbs so it was a bit much for me) Be patient, if you are taking it for less than a month, stay with it for a little longer, the side effects went away for me. 
My family members do not know that I am trying this. I noticed that I am much more relaxed and less obsessive about stupid little things and I think more clearly, have more energy, and am a bit more patient with my kids. It helped me to realize how today is important and to enjoy what I have now because  life is too short! I still feel anxious at times, but not like I used to be! Also, I am not so negative all the time and critical about others. 
I hope that it continues to work for me!
I wrote a lot in hopes of helping others.

Taking Wellbutrin together with Imipramine, the Wellbutrin has some kind of a reaction that does not allow the Liver to properly metabolize the Imipramine.  This happend to me.  I presented with all kinds of Neurological symptoms, but actually had VERY HIGH BLOOD LEVELS of imipramine even though my dosage had remained unchanged for over a year.  There is some actual medical research available to back this up, however, until recently this has not been a problem because these two drugs are not often prescribed together.

It counteracts the negative sexual and tired effects of lexapro, which I take 10 mg of.  I think Wellbutrin is best as a supplement to an SSRI, especially if you have anxiety issues.

Also, wellbutrin gives me back sex drive and energy...I feel it complements lexapro nicely, and they have worked together for about a year for me for depression and anxiety.

Previously, I had taken Zoloft, which made me feel spaced-out and took away my libido.  Wellbutrin has helped with my depression without taking away any of the good stuff.

I've had some side effects-- nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and restlessness/aggression/sleeplessness for the first few days, but it wasn't anything I couldn't live with, and most of it has passed by now.

I had issues with Lexapro because it made me sleep almost 20 hours one night a week. So far I do notice a loss of appetite, and nice as that is, I have to make sure at the end of each day that i have had enough to eat. This may have to do with taking concerta which also lowers appetite. I really don't feel jittery or anything. It defainetly gets my oversleeping under control and is great so far. I got sick during this time so it  is possible that some symptoms i had were related or lexapro withdrawal. These were headache, loss of consciousness (but i have low blood pressure), nausea, and ears popping. I don't know much else yet but so far it is working. It also has made me not need to smoke (which is great because i really shouldn't). It could be depression but i also feel like i am either over or under emotional. Don't know but it is better than oversleeping. I would take pretty much anything over that.

461$Condition: Depression$12/9/2007 8:20:06 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have struggled with depression my whole life and I am not 34. I have been one-and-off meds since 2000. In April 2007 I went back on the meds again. This time it was Zoloft, which made me feel terrific when it kicked in, but I gradually needed more and more until I (at 110 lbs) was at the maximum dosage of 200mg generic Zoloft (sertraline) by September 2007. So my psychiatrist added Wellbutrin, which seemed to help. Honestly, as someone who actually works as a license adolescent therapist and has a lot of experience with my own and treating depression.... the cycle never ends. You spend your whole life switching meds, gradually going off the meds, changing meds, and starting meds over. The best thing you can do is read a lot of books about depression and figure out what contributes to your depression. For me, I grew up with an alcoholic parents and basically walked on egg shells. You never knew if you'd be yanked out of bed by your hair in the middle of the night to wash dishes, you could never have a friend over and no matter what you did it was wrong. Research shows this actually interferes with your brain development and contributes to depression. Today, I have a busy career and I have to monitor how much I take on or I get angry and obsessive along with the depression. I can also say you need to marry someone who understands depression and is NOT depressed themselves. The spouse needs to be supportive and you need to have rules. One of our rules is that my husband will never walk away from me (because it sends me into a depressive rage). My husband also realizes that sometimes I say mean and nasty things to him that I would never say if I weren't having a depressive angry moment. It's hard. We have a toddler and my husband is an at home dad. We love our daughter and want her to have a parents at home, but it can't be me with my depression. My husband being at home help lessen my depression because it's less home-management for me. [email protected]

Itried to just stop and it was hard. When I slowly reduced the dose I was able to get off it okay. My sister took Paxil and stayed hooked on it. It also killed her sex drive and caused her divorce. Her husband cheated on her. I didn't have any problems like that with Wellbutrin and I lost 18 pounds! God bless the people who invented this stuff.
