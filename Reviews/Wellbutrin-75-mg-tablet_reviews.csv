For the last 2 years I've been battling with a pretty serious methamphetamine addiction. Before I had ever began taking meth (R.O.A. vaporizing in a pipe) I had battled with depression of variable severity, for almost as long as I can remember. I was also diagnosed with ADD as a young kid and was prescribed Adderall as a fix, but only took it for a short period of time (maybe 3 weeks if memory serves me right). The first time I ever used methamphetamine I felt as if I was a normal person for the first time ever. It allowed me to think clearly, express myself more easily, gave me the greatly needed boost of energy and metabolism (have always been slightly overweight), reduced anxiety and boosted mood. But of course what goes up must come down (especially when you get arrested). So because of added scrutiny from probation and the court system, I became desperate to find something that allowed me to A.)Not crave meth (the mental withdrawals are awful,and you WILL be severely depressed for a long time) and B.) Provide some relief from my baseline issues. *Now please note*
There is not clinical recomend treatment for methamphetamine abuse. But the few independent studies I examined listed Wellbutrin as one of the most effective M.A.T.'s. 
I am currently taking 40mg xR orally once daily, and by the 2nd day I instantly noticed a difference in my mental well being. Compared to how bad off I was and just completely unwilling to stop using meth, I would call this a miracle. And ironically the only other methamphetamine user I know that also has taken Wellbutrin reported similar success as myself, I would say it's criminal that they're not doing more research into using this or other similar meds to help curb methamphetamine addiction.

1$Condition: Other$12/9/2019 3:06:02 AM$Reviewer: Let’s not meet again, Wellbutrin, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"Wellbutrin (and to be fair, my Drs negligent behavior) almost killed me. I have fairly severe C-PTSD with a lot of disassociation, flashbacks and I am prone to severe bouts of anxiety. I saw my psych when I could tell I was heading towards a depression spiral. I could feel all motivation slipping away, and as a college student with ADHD and finals next week she suggested that I try it. “It’s a super easy drug” she said; “it’ll be fine, what’s the worst that could happen?” I thought.

Literally every side effect it could have caused it did— and I only took it for a week and a bit. I didn’t sleep for days at a time. I saw things I knew weren’t there. I had trouble going to gatherings because I got panicky in crowds (never happened to me before. A friend who isn’t me said it was reminiscent of being stoned). I got super paranoid and anxious, was incredibly confused and couldn’t focus, and I felt like I was going to drop dead from a heart attack. Multiple friends stopped me to ask what I was on and if I needed help getting back to my dorm room because you couldn’t see the color of my eyes. But by far the worst part was that it made me incredibly, indescribably suicidal. I have been suicidal most of my life and had attempted before then but Wellbutrin made it 10000% more horror movie-esque. Instead of thinking about normal (??!?) suicidal thoughts I was so out of it that I was seriously thinking/fantasizing  about super graphic imagery. 
But just to humble brag, during the Welbutrin hell week I still managed to get all As in all my finals.

Additionally an immediate family member tried Wellbutrin with eerily similar results.

****btw I want to make it clear that Wellbutrin works for many people, I think this horrible experience is more on the Dr than anything else. My next psychiatrist said it was “borderline malpractice” to put anyone on a new medication that wasn’t 100p necessary before a stressful time much less someone with my background.***"

Increased my anxiety to the point of panic attacks. I have never had panic attacks in my life! I was dizzy constantly, had muscle aches in my neck and back, was stressed beyond measure! I’ve been off it for 10 days and still feeling anxious and panicky. This was just awful.

I took Wellbutrin XL for only 5 days. I soon developed odd patches on my skin resembling abrasions and pinpoint bleeding. I developed severe itching, primarily at night, that lasted for a month-and-a-half. Now, a full three months later, my skin still exhibits markedly slower healing from cuts and abrasions. 

If you have had skin problems and/or itching as a result of taking Wellbutrin XL (also called Bupropion XR) and would like to add your name to a Class Action suit against the makers of it, please email me at [email protected] Put the word “itching” in the subject line.

I had to organize a Class Action suit against a major US automaker in 2010 and succeeded. We will get results.

I switched back to WELLBUTRIN an I am in an upswing again.
Mylan Bupropion did nothing for me. It actually ruined my life for 2 years. Nothing worse than feeling like the world is super messed up.
BUT now there is no Wellbutrin and they want me to keep on the MYLAN, this is messed up,
COME ON WELLBUTRIN lets get a move on!!!
Awake, energized, stable, secure, balanced. 
Seroquel at night to sleep and sometimes a low dose thyroid pill helps counter

5$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$3/27/2019 2:49:52 PM$Reviewer: RedLipstick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$5$I was switched to Wellbutrin after taking Zoloft for 6 months. Zoloft helped my depression but I had terrible nightmares that worsened and turned into night terrors/paralysis couldn't take it anymore. I've been on Wellbutrin XR 150mg for 4 days and already seeing an elevated mood, energy increase, overall feeling like my non depressed active self again and it feels amazing! The downside is that every day so far, 2 hours after taking it, I puke a few times and am nauseous almost all morning. I'm not a breakfast person so the first 2 days I took it on empty stomach, thought that might cause sickness but yesterday and today I ate toast with my dose - didn't make a difference. Today I also noticed a metallic taste in my mouth not sure if that's a side effect though. I'm 5 feet and weigh 117 lbs so I'm not sure if the dose is too much taking all at once, my Dr said it should be a good starting dose so idk. I'll give it a few more days before requesting dose change, definitely not giving up on it bc it's working! 
6$Condition: Depression$3/12/2019 11:49:58 AM$Reviewer: Bipolar2coolforschool, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$"I have bipolar II and after a series of failed drugs, I was prescribed quetiapine (that's a whole other message board) and bupropion. 

I was on Activas bupropion 150 XL for about six weeks. It stabilized me, but I was still depressed - but functioning. Side effects - waking up early, feeling like a zombie, loss of appetite - went away within that time period. 

I've now been on Par Pharmaceutical's bupropion 300 XL for about a month. Side effects are irritability and jitters, but I'm hoping those go away. I tried Activas 300 XL - oval pills - and it seemed to dump a large portion of the medication about two hours after taking it, giving me a zombie effect. It also gave me a headache. Those things may have gone away with time, but I switched back to Par. 

Overall I'm content and my depression is completely gone."
7$Condition: Depression$2/25/2019 7:05:12 AM$Reviewer: Warox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"Firstly note this medicine not for everyone. Everyone's brain chemestry is different. It is one of the most popular and commonly used antidepressant due to it's general efficiency and fewer shitty side effects than other drugs. Personally, two weeks after starting 150mg bupropion, I'm already starting to feel somewhat better overall.

The way I've understood this drug works is by preventing the recapture of dopamine and noradrenaline. This leads to a slow but steady build up of those two chemicals in the brain. That' why the full efficiency of this drug is obtained a few weeks later after starting taking it. Dopamine is the feel good reward chemical which makes you feel slightly happier in general and makes you want to do things more since you're reward signal in the brain is ""boosted"". Not absolutely sur about the noradrenaline part but I think it's from this chemical adrenaline comes from. This could explain why this drug makes you more awake and energized than normally. Not sure but dopamine too i think helps keep awake. Anyways, even the specialists aren't exactly sure HOW antidepressants exactly works. 

 So far for me the first few days I felt a little ""something"" positively different about how I felt in general. I've been sadly having trouble to feel emotions and happyness for a very long time. Feel like a machine that mainly works eats and sleep. Now I'm starting to have more energy, want to do more things and actually enjoy myself sometimes. Better mood. I actually smile because I feel like it sometimes instead of smiling because I'M supposed to. Don't oversleep anymore. More sociable. Better attention and focus. Think better. Got some libido back. Losing fat and gaining muscle since im more active. Seems I'm actually starting to enjoy life a little. So far the pros are better than cons. Insomnia (i need seroquel to sleep well), rise in anxiety are the two downsides. A bit worst in the begining but it lessens. Got used to it. Definately worth it for me."

9$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$2/6/2019 4:59:28 PM$Reviewer: Mike, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I had struggled with depression on my own before finally giving in and seeing a therapist. I resisted therapy and drugs for years- men are supposed to take care of their own problems....aren't they? Well a series of very trying and anxiety ridden events pushed me over the edge and on my way to getting help- I'm glad I reached out. After going over the options my doctor prescribed Wellbutrin extended release in a 150mg once daily dose (in the morning- don't take it in the evening or you will struggle to fall sleep). I have to say that this drug has really helped me. The very low, sad moods are gone, the fits of anger have subsided, I have more patience at work and with family, I haven't had a drink in months and I no longer think about suicide. I have a much easier time controlling my appetite, which with giving up alcohol, has resulted in a loss of about 20 lbs. My wife has remarked many times that I am 'nicer' now that I am on medication. I have to take her word for it. Seems I was stuck in a dark pit of my own making and couldn't figure a way to get out. I was going through the motions and was thoroughly miserable while doing it, and making everyone around me uneasy. This drug isn't a cure all for bad attitudes and badly lived lives but it can help, possibly, if a person is motivated to change. It will wind you up a bit- I do take a mild sedative at night to sleep. I have also found Wellbutrin to reduce libido but only slightly - this seems to run counter to many others experience. I have addressed that little problem by taking very small doses (7mg- 1/4 of a 25mg pill) of Viagra when the time is right. Otherwise there seem to be few negative side effects, at least for me. I don't like to take drugs but I recognize that Wellbutrin is very useful. Its off patent and I ask for the generic (Bupropion- inexpensive). At some point I hope to taper down and get off it but I could stay on it for a long time if I needed to and could live my life fully.                
10$Condition: Depression$1/27/2019 9:35:32 PM$Reviewer: DelCarmem, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$This medication worked very well for me. I had never taken anti depressants and my doctor recommended this one. It really made a huge difference in my mood and outlook, however it had one unbearable side effect for me. It made me soooooo itchy. I was losing my mind. I tried everything possible to control the itching, different soap, shower water filter, cortisone creams, numbing cream, ice..  nothing helped. I really wanted to stay on it and did my best to see if the side effect went away but it was excruciating.  As soon as I stopped it within a week it was better. But here I am almost 3 weeks after my last pill and I still get an itch attack all of a sudden Iâ??m the evening or the morning. I decided to write this down because two doctors told me this was an uncommon side effect for this medication and that maybe it was something else, but it definitely was the meds.

Went from size 10 Miss to size 04, not intentionally. Can't put weight on although I've been eating fatty stuff and protein drinks. Was on 150mg once a day  but it did not significantly decrease depression but caused rapid alarming weight loss. Dr tells me that is not due to medicine but stress associated  with upcoming divorce. Dr increased my dose this past week to 300mg at night. My lab work is on Wednesday  and I will be asking Dr  to switch my medicine.

So maybe stick with it for a few weeks before giving it up....... as it becomes very effective for me.

It also stops working every once in a while, I actually had to double my dose 150 to 300 mg) but iâ??m not seeing the results i did in the very beginning.

I had side effects that increased my libido or should I say turned on my libido, I was dead that way and didn't know it.  I was horny for almost a month 24/7.

I have been dealing with anxiety for many years, but this drug made it 100x worse!  I hadn’t had a bad panic attack in a long time before taking this drug, and within a few weeks on the regimen, I had horrible panic attacks multiple times a day.  My OCD and depression also worsened.

I put up with the sexual dysfunction but the nightmares got the better of me when I couldn't tell real from dreams.  I dove into work and just made myself forget about love. Bt the dreams...so they switched to zoloft which was not much better than prozac. Then switched to welbutrin.  It worked good enough, and I was glad to not have those horrible dreams and to get my libido back... but... I could not sleep with this.  I'm running on 4-5 hours sleep a night.  Curiously enough my dentist told me it was like an amphetamine!  But after being on this one year... it is not working anymore.  I'm crying alot, getting very irritable, yelling at people, angry, hopeless, unlovable... Its just plain not working for me at all.  I dont know if it is the lack of sleep or what.  but I cant do this anymore.  I dont know what to do now.  Called doc and I guess I have to go through the 6-week weaning off period to try yet another drug.  How am I supposed to work and be normal when I am not? I just want to feel normal without bad side effects.  I wonder why that is just not possible for me to attain normalcy? See? depression. everything is hopeless for me.

For the first month the drug worked great, but shortly after I stated experiencing horrible sexual side effects. The medication decreases sensation,vaginal lubrication, and makes it almost impossible to orgasm. My dr assured me that this wouldn't happen, but unfortunately my body responded differently than most of the population. Needless to say I've stopped taking the medication, which is sad because a lost so much weight while on it.

When I first started taking it (75mg), I noticed an increase in acne, but I didn't yet connect it to the medication. I thought it may have simply been due to stress. Then when I increased my dosage to 150mg, my acne got much worse. It was very shocking, as I never really had more than a few pimples before. But now my forehead is covered in bumps and angry, red pimples. This typically isn't included as a side effect, but online I've found that many other people got cystic acne after taking this drug.

It has helped with my mood. I feel like I can start getting things done easier. I put somewhat effective because it helps me to focus on things I already know how to do. Keeping focus when learning new things was a challenge. When I take it in the morning I don't feel like going back to bed. I am able to either get things done or relax and watch TV. It doesn't give me the feeling that I HAVE to be doing something. I was able to go to work after taking it. Although I did have anxiety when talking to people at work. Mostly because I felt different. That feeling went away after 5 days. I never felt uncomfortable while being out and about. Just in case I feel I should let you know I started at 150mg for 4 weeks then went to 300mg. That is the normal way to start. Plus when I went up in mg I had no ill effects.

I usually take 150mg daily, but in mid-winter I take 300mg and sometimes I can go off it completely in the summer. It depends on stress, exposure to sunlight, exercise. The only lasting side effect is excessive sweating when working out, but I put up with it because other anti-depressants have much worse side effects.

It also took away what little sex drive I had which Dr. said it wouldn't.  I went back to Dr. and he switched me to Wellbutrin xl titriting up to 300 mg after 150 for first week. Major improvements in just first week. More energy, motivation, happy like my old self that had disappeared years ago. Only drawbacks I have noticed are the dry mouth and a little constipation. Just need to stay hydrated well taking this med.  Wellbutrin gave me my life back.

I had been on Zoloft, Abilify, etc etc and none of them helped me like Wellbutrin XL has! I've been on it 2 years now and usually stay at 150mg,during the hard time of year for me (Dec/Jan) I go up to as high as 450mg. This drug has been a miracle in my life, it gives me time to notice red flags, like feelings of hopelessness, failure, dread, and wanting to die.. and so I can up my dose before things get out of hand..like in the past (suicide attempts etc). Give this med a try if you haven't had much success with some of the others! I've even lost weight on this medication because it gives me more energy.

I struggled with Depression for about seven years and have tried many different antidepressants. None of them worked, but when I was on Wellbutrin everything changed quite dramatically. I am very happy right now. And after being in a severe depression for so many years, it's so nice that I found the right medication and dose. I'm on 450mg of Wellbutrin and 300mg (150 2x a day) of Lamictal. No side effects so far. I can drink alcohol and smoke weed with it. (Not interested in other drugs so I'm not sure about those.) And my psychiatrist approved of the weed and alcohol.

41$Condition: Depression$9/5/2016 10:51:10 AM$Reviewer: Thankful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I normally never write on these things, but this medication has worked SO WELL for me, that I wanted to share, in case my comments might help someone who is undecided about Wellbutrin.

I have had severe depression for about 10 years. Had been on prozac and effexor before wellbutrin. They both worked, but not even close to how the wellbutrin is helping me! I'm taking 300mg XL per day.

I felt so much happier even on day 1...  I couldn't believe how happy I was & still am feeling! I didn't know it was possible for a person to even feel this happy! (Not to mention the increased sex drive)!  ??

I also have severe fibromyalgia & social anxiety. Wellbutrin has helped all of it! I knew my effexor was not working for me any longer, since I had been on it for 3 years already.

I found myself gradually staying home from functions I would normally attend, was EXTREMELY fatigued & just wanted to stay in bed all day. My family told me I was very irritable. I didn't see it. I first had my hormone levels checked to see if that was the problem, The hormones were all normal.I called my psychiatrist the next day and started on the wellbutrin.

My family and I noticed a difference immediately, I was laughing again! It has given me an enormous energy boost! I have gotten things done that I've been meaning to do for the last couple of years, but could never do because of the lack of energy & motivation. I even started a part time job! It has suppressed my appetite, which I'm excited about, since I need to lose some weight.

I have never been happier than I am now! Please realize though that all medications don't work for EVERY person... our brain chemistries are all different, but I would most definitely give it a try! I wish you all the best & hope it works as well for you as it has for me.

There were minor side effects the first couple of weeks, (headaches & insomnia) but they went away and I couldn't be more happy or thankful for how much Wellbutrin has helped me!"
42$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$8/26/2016 10:05:03 AM$Reviewer: Sad Sue, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$With major depressive disorder, I have, over the years, had to go on medication every so often to balance out the chemicals in my brain. Wellbutrin has  been a God send. I have tried other anti-depressants too but they had bad side effects, low blood pressure, dizziness, dry mouth etc. Wellbutrin has none of these side effects for me. In fact, I have been losing weight prior to going on Wellbutrin so I specifically asked the doctor for something that would not cause me to gain weight. He wrote me the prescription for Wellbutrin with no substitutions allowed.It had to be brand name. I am pleased to say that I have not gained weight and I have been on this medication for over a year now. I am so happy to say this medication has performed well on all counts. 
43$Condition: Depression$8/14/2016 8:26:15 PM$Reviewer: mk, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have had three episodes of depression in my life.  Each were event caused.  I was 35 for the first episode and the doctor gave me Wellbutrin.  It worked great and there were no side effects.   It stopped the deep sadness I felt.   The situation still stunk, but at least I was not a weeping mess.  I needed it for six months. The next event happened at age 47.  Wellbutrin helped again.  More bad news at 49 with depression and anxiety this time.  Wellbutrin is keeping me calm and less sad.  No side effects.
44$Condition: Depression$8/6/2016 1:32:17 PM$Reviewer: Lucky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was hospitalized for severe depression and anxiety almost two years ago. The doctor immediately started me on a low dose of Wellbutrin (the generic type), and upped it to 300mg before I was released. I went through four other medications for anxiety, since Wellbutrin often does not treat both depression and anxiety. Finally, I ended up with Zoloft, which also enhances the effect of Wellbutrin. Over months of treatment, the Wellbutrin was amazing! It lifted my mood, raised my energy, increased my focus, evened out my appetite, reduced my smoking, and increased my metabolism. With diet and exorcise on Wellbutrin, I was able to lose 50 lbs. Usually my metabolism is so low that I can eat olny salad with steady activity and lose nothing. So getting back down to a normal weight (122 lbs at 5'5"") was amazing. 
After 15 months of treatment, I wanted to wean off of the medications to see how I would do. I had been at the maximum does of 450mg of Wellbutrin and 200mg of Zoloft daily. After 5 months of no medication, I was spiraling down back to where I had started. It was hard to climb back out of that hole, but at least this time I knew the footing. I made an appointment with my doctor, and in the mean time, wanted to start back on the lowest dose of the pills I still had. Not expired, my prescription, all legal. The PROBLEM came when I mistook the dosage for each Wellbutrin pill, thinking they were 50mg each. Well, no, they were 150mg each, and I took three. Really, really bad idea. I felt the effects immediately, felt great, did work, a little shaky, knew I shouldn't drive so I didn't. That night, I got two hours of sleep. Took the same amount the next day, then realized my mistake. I haven't slept in three nights. I'm staying hydrated and being careful, not taking any more, but the point is: When taken correctly, it can amazing! DO NOT take more than directed!"

I still struggle with deep depression and anxiety. Due to the depression, I was constantly fatigued and couldn't concentrate. I was always sleepy. After taking Wellbutrin, it's helped tremendously. I feel like me again. I'm no longer constantly fatigued or sleepy. Unfortunately, I can't concentrate sometimes, but most times I can. As far as side effects, my doctor later instructed for me to take the medicine in the morning because it would give me insomnia. I'm relatively small so I need to have a good meal or drink lots of water or else I can get a bad stomach ache or even throw up. I also hear ringing in my ears at times. 
46$Condition: Depression$7/26/2016 11:41:58 AM$Reviewer: zarer77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been slightly depressed for about 10 years, but never thought I needed medication.  After a traumatic event 6 months ago I was sick of crying, no motivation, anxiety, etc. I finally went to my family doctor she prescribed me Zoloft, and hydroxozine for anxiety. I noticed my depression and crying for no reason had subsided, but I became depressed in a different way because it made me so tired I could physically not do anything besides work. She switched me to Celexa and Cymbalta where I had the same problem and could hardly make it through a work day I was sleeping in my car at lunch.  About to give up I went to a Psychiatrist who recommended the generic wellbutrin. I started at 150mgXL for one week noticed absolutely no side effects.  The 8th day I started 300mg and noticed the energy a few hours later. I went grocery shopping, cleaned entire house, etc WILLINGLY.  Normally it would take me a week to have enough motivation to do one of these things. I almost cried I was so happy. I actually sat down and had a conversation with my boyfriend smiling and laughing- he looked at me crazy like he did not know how to respond because I have not been that way in so long. Now, I have only been taking it such a short time, but will definitely try 4-6 weeks for full effect.  I have had mild headaches (I had some before) a little dry mouth, and increased sex drive/orgasm. So far I am just thankful that it has put hope back in my life.

Was diagnosed with PTSD. I went through the gambit of anti-depressants/anxiety medications over the years. I had major side affects to all and was down to Wellbutrin or Zoloft. Tried Wellbutrin and it had been working great, minimal side effects, up to 250mg a day. Earlier this year I had sinusitis with fluid in my ears, doctor prescribed a steroid and Augmentin. Within 3 days I had a horrible, metallic taste in my mouth. Figured it was from the new medication. It was so bad I couldn't eat and lost 12lbs in 1 1/2 weeks. I stopped the additional meds and the metallic taste has subsided, but took about 2 months to clear up. Now I have a minimal lack of taste,(best example-I can't taste chocolate) a side effect of the Wellbutrin which is all I take now. I like this medication, it has helped make me myself before Afghanistan, but why am I having this side effect now after 3 years of use? My Dr. has stepped me back to 200mg, but I am pretty much out of options for other meds. Do I keep suffering not being able to enjoy food or come of the meds and risk feeling like the world is about to explode and I have to fight my way through it?

I was going to power through until on the fourth day my eyesight became blurred. Letters appeared to have dropshadows. After contacting my doctor he took me off the meds and said to see an ophthalmologist as the drug could cause glaucoma. I went to the eye clinic and was tested and told I did not have glaucoma. But the doctor said my pupil was a little dialated and that could cause a focus problem. GlaxoSmithKline in their pdf file says this is called ""mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma."" So, if you vision is blurred after taking this, beware. I was hoping it would work for me."

I am someone who loves smoking, so naturally this was not what I wanted to hear.  I do suffer from anxiety a lot of times.  I went to see my general practioner who talked to me about the quitting of smoking and my anxiety.  She is a fan of the wellbutrin oral.  She said it will help with cravings and my anxiety that I face in general.  She put me on a dose of 150 mg.  She explained it could take 4-6 weeks to kick in, so I will most likely remain smoking for awhile until this has effects on me.  I am going into week 5...and have not had a cigarette in 5 days.  I smoked my normal amount up until 3 days ago and just like that..my urges have gone away tremendously.  The small urges I do have at times, I fight off mentally.  This drug has helped with the anxiety I've had and it just takes my mind off of cigarettes.  I have noticed I do wake up a few times during the night unfortunately and because of the broken sleep, I experience a very slight headache in the mornings.  It's a small consequence for me .  I'm currently not smoking and not feeling anxious.

I've had no side effects except I have dizzy spells occasionally if I stand up to fast. I'm so glad I take Wellbutrin, it changed my life.

I had depression. It took all of my energy for the day to answer one email, and I would cry for no reason often. But after three weeks of Wellbutrin 150XL, I was whistling tunes I hadn't in years, and I was happy and energetic for the first time since I was a kid. At the same time, though, it's like my conscience switched off. I immediately started cheating on my wife of 9 years. Repeated hookups again and again with other men. I would prowl around town, horny out of my mind. It was like I was high. I would never have acted on these impulses before, not in a million years. Concerned that I was bipolar, I told my doctor and he screened me, asking if I was buying stuff. No? Then it must be because I was happier and more confident now. I should have insisted something was wrong, but the drug made me not care, plus my happiness made marriage great and she had no idea. I just wanted to keep going. That was 10 months ago. IF YOU GET IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOUR GET OFF OF IT BEFORE IT WRECKS YOUR LIFE. I hate what I've become. I don't know what's going to happen when I get off this cursed drug. I'm afraid all the time. And I'm still doing it.

When I started the drug it gave me more energy and I felt more ""alive"".  I had a slight headache and a some insomnia at first but that got better after a few days.  I was somewhat short tempered at times but that is most likely the release of all the pent up frustration I had been harboring while depressed.  It seemed to increase my sex drive and actually the side effects felt like Viagra in that I had a flushed face and slightly fast heartbeat along with the mild headache.  I am hoping that my better moods continue and that I can get back to enjoying my life and being more optimistic about the future."

After 3 years I started having extreme woozy/lightheaded spells that were ruining my life. Everyone kept blaming it on my anxiety. After three years of hating life I went off of wellbutrin. It took over 30 days before I even started to see relief, but by the 90 day mark I was free from those spells. I have my life back. It would not have gone away. Wellbutrin helps with the kind of depression where you have NO motivation and crave sugar. It will make you dehydrated, constipated, edgy, and a light sleeper that only needs about 6 hours per night. It isn't good for anxiety and will not help it. During the adjustment period you could lose about 10 lbs and have the most vivid nightmares ever. This drug will stop working for you. At first you can be so numb but after awhile you start to feel very depressed again. It's not until you go off of it do you realize that it was helping. It really only seems to be popular because of the lack of weight gain and no decrease in your sex drive. Those are really the only positive things but you just have to figure out if the other side effects are worth it.

In the past I had a history of starting an antidepressant when things got really bad for me, noticed myself improving then gradually stopped taking it...then gradually fell back into the dark hole that felt impossible to get out of.  I have been taking different doses of Prozac for about the last 6 years ( which I also love when I stay on it ! ) and Celexa before that.. ( made me wayy too sleepy, counterproductive because when i'm depressed ALL i do is sleep ). This last time around, I had finally had enough, I wanted to pull myself together and stay on the medicine once and for all ( hey your Brain is an organ, and if you need medication stay on it! feeling great means it is working :) ) I went back on my Prozac ( 40 mg in Feb. when my depression was at it's worst, and anxiety= vicious cycle) and slowly noticed it taking effect, but not as effective as it was. My Dr. added the Wellbutrin ( 100 mg at first, now 200 ) and within 1-2 weeks I felt better than I have ever, ever. My motivation is back, determination, focus, energy, self worth and purpose all have returned, and gone are the days i feel lost, exhausted, and like a total piece of shit.  Talk to your Dr.! With these meds I've had a whole life style change, I was able to lose 30 pounds and counting, my binge emotional eating has subsided, i work out, went back to school and work like 50 hours a week! I eat great, natural, and organic foods that help fuel my body and mind, and do yoga to center myself.  ALl i needed was that little push, and at almost 30 I'm finally a better version of myself. Hang in there!!! I promise there is hope!

The only down side, my Lumosity game scores dropped significantly--I was at 99.8%--it was already lower than what I got before the most recent depressive episode which was in the high 99.9% with several metrics topped out at 100%. After I take the medication, I can barely make 98%. While playing the game, I can feel I am much slower, less sharp, less attentive, but more flexible. "

I should have known better. Years ago my ex husband had a seizure on it. I thought we were different enough that maybe it could help me. Wrong! It made me so I'll in so many ways I am lucky to be alive . I had so many of the side effects I can't list them all. At 52 I had never been to an emergency room until this horrific drug. Some of the side effects I had include waking up drenched in sweat (worse than any hot flash), with a splitting headache, I stood up and was hit with severe nausea and dizziness, made it to the bathroom only to collapse over the toilet where I sobbed uncontrollably for half an hour. This was the final incident that brought me to the ER, where all they cared about was whether or not I was suicidal. Do yourself a favor and Do Not take this drug under any circumstances.

Unfortunately I have made some poor decisions over the years, and being depressed so much seems obvious to me now, was a huge part of those poor decisions(as well as evidence in journals, and doctor notes to prove depression was ""at fault"").  I guess better late than never.  Its a relief to feel better, not cry every day, to feel good, or at least normal about yourself.

The side effects are with me, but I don't care! Just try to get on it slower if possible.  Don't cut the pills in half, I made that mistake, it can cause an overdose or seizures. I was lucky and wised up on that.

The reviews on this page have helped me a lot, and I want to thank everyone for helping, and the website for making this available.

I am 52 yrs old now, maybe now I can make better decisions, act better, listen better, whine less, focus more, eat less, care more, and be more appealing to myself and others.  Its amazing how so many things can be tied to and capable of working for you, when you get the help.

I hope you get the help sooner than I did, I waited way too many years to get this help, don't wait, at least give it a try."
76$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$1/24/2015 12:21:13 PM$Reviewer: WonderAll, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$My first and worst severe depressive episode had me to believe that I would continue down into the hole I had built for myself. I couldn't see the bright side of a single word, my memory to include short, long, and working were gone, my concentration was shot, and I slept less than 3 hours a night for weeks on end and thus began to experience panic attacks. The first morning after taking Wellbutrin I woke up without shaking uncontrollably. The deep pit of despair was gone. I could still feel its presence because I had so often visited it, but my thoughts would not drag me down with them. The cold words began to bounce off of me. Wellbutrin felt like a shield. I was told it would take weeks for me to feel the effects, not one night, but perhaps I was so far gone that even the tiniest bit of change in my brain chemistry was enough to give me such a sense of improvement. The thoughts were still there, the negativity, Wellbutrin didn't get rid of the way I spoke to myself, but it allowed me to see doubts as lies, it gave me a way to fight back. It gave me a way to see all the put-downs were misconstrued. It took me about a week to understand that there were side-effects to using anti-depressants. I only took it for a month, but I am still feeling the effects. At first I had severe memory loss that had nothing to do with major depressive disorder and a strange emptiness and odd pressure behind my right eye. I also had periods where I would wander, go to the store, grab a coffee, talk to someone, and not remember, as if I had lost an hour of the day. Because I didn't take it for more than 5 weeks, I can't say for sure if the side-affects would have disappeared, but for that time there was also a strange psychedelic feeling, a sense that I had actually been drugged. I've never done anything recreationally before, but it was that feeling you get before being completely knocked out by morphine before a procedure, without the loss of pain associated with it.

Because of this accident, I suffered severe financial problems and major depression issues. I started seeing a Psychiatrist who prescribed Wellbutrin 150 Mg per day. (I was on Zoloft for 8 years prior to car accident) The first few days I was very jittery and had some bad anxiety. I felt like I was on speed. I then had massive insomnia for first 4-6 days. I also noticed headaches coming and going for first few weeks, but that has gotten a lot better.  THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS, so if there's any advice or comments I can give, it would be to stick out the side effects for first few weeks. It will be worth the wait. This drug has changed my life in such a positive way. I began to get my energy back, sex life got 10 X better and I felt the way I did in my 20's. It's only helped my relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years and my 2 children.

I tried Celexa & EFfexor & quit them immediately due to side effects. I had to switch taking Wellbutrin in the morning bc at night it kept me awake & woke me often. I'm also a smoker & it has cut that back significantly. I had no appetite issues & no change in sex drive. I believe it helps get me up each day & keeps my emotions in better check. I am going through something that causes anger & sadness often. Lots of rants & crying spells but they have subsided & when they do happen it's less intense. It did cause me to be more anxious & I deal with high anxiety already so I am taking Busprione (15 mg 3x/day) on days my anxiety is higher but don't take it every day. 
My ONLY gripe is that on the 300 mg I feel as if my throat is closed all day. It's hard to swallow & feel l have to take deep breaths often. When my anxixety is high, it's much worse, sometimes nearly intolerable. BUT bc I feel it has helped me mood wise, I keep taking it. I'm tired of being a drug guinea pig & hope that this is temporary as I work through my situation. Hoping in time I can reduce back to 150 mg bc I didn't have the throat issue when I took that amount but for now I feel I need the 300 mg. "

This medication has been a life savor. I was taking it in conjunction with Zoloft. However, I asked my psychiatrist about taking it alone and she said she would let me try even though she did not recommend it. I found it to be more effective without the Zoloft because I have a lot of side effects (negative) from the Zoloft. This has allowed me to still have a medication to allow stability, yet without the negative side effects. I also take Topamax at 400 mg daily. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder.

Never as long as I can recall into early childhood able to express any positive emotions. As my mother would say instead of a normal young child craving accolades for a job well,hug and kisses I would push her away furious at the thought. Also refusal to conform for treats at friends or relatives houses. I would rather go without cake and ice cream at a bday party than to say please and thank you. Not to be stubborn but would not conform. Most importantly and the root of my issue is still until as od these last few days have I ever, ever EVER uttered the words I Love You. A very painful inner conflict having been married for going on 21 years with 4 children with all other 5 members saying it freely to everyone including to me but have never have had it said by myself. Since my starting this drug I not only have came out from my closed off hidden from letting others know my heart but Im worse than a love sick child with my wife having her almost in tears to finally hear it and now multiple times a day to her unabated......this being said baby steps Im working on it with my children.

I love love love this drug. I take 300mg once a day (I have friends who took lower doses, and it didn't work for them) and the first time I took it, I immediately felt better. I actually got a buzz from it the first time-like way too much coffee-but that disappeared the next day. I have no trouble sleeping while taking it, but it does give me constipation, to a degree-not too bad though. It also increases sexual desire, to a degree that might make it a woman's Viagra. Everyone's body chemistry is different, but I went from being a depressed, irritable witch, to being happy and mellow. I feel peppy, not terribly hungry, and happy. That's a big improvement, but I was never exceedingly depressed, except episodically, so I don't know if it's strong enough for someone with severe depression. It works for me though, and I really like taking it.

I'm currently on generic Wellbutrin SR, 150 mg twice a day (8 hrs apart). I have been on this medication for 4 weeks now, following a 2 week horror period on Lexapro. Wellbutrin isn't supposed to be effective immediately, but when I started it, I noticed a huge increase in energy and my ability to pay attention, my thoughts felt less cloudy and I felt more optimistic everyday. Those feelings faded a little after about 4 or 5 days (likely a placebo effect).
I have found that drinking alcohol while on this medication makes me turn into a totally awful person to be around. I would get mad at the slightest thing and be completely unable to get over it, no matter how hard my partner tried to help. I would basically shut down for the night if I drank, and would feel depressed for 2-3 days afterward as well.
I have been a self-harmer for about 6 or 7 years. While on this medication, I have only cut twice, but have become much more optimistic that I can stop my addiction to self-harm. I feel like life is more worth living in general and I tend to have a more positive outlook, even when there is some issue at hand. I don't feel like everything that goes wrong is my fault and I feel like I've become more productive and feel much more rewarded when I complete things. 
One other positive of this medication is that it has really decreased my appetite. I'm only slightly overweight at 5'4"" and about 145-150 lbs, but I used to eat all the time and now I don't usually feel like I'm hungry, even when I go half the day without eating. I eat more for taste and for health now than out of boredom. 
Overall I've had a pretty positive experience, and I will likely be switching to the extended release, 300 mg once a day the next time I see my doctor. "

I found that Wellbutrin treated all of this but without the side effect of night sweats and weight gain Paxil had.  I am however on a really low dose of Paxil still because I couldn't cope with the withdrawals when I stopped it comp letely, so the Paxil might be affecting how I feel but I doubt that much because I'm taking half of the smallest pill dose they offer

Although it gave me a little energy shortly after taking it, it didn’t really do all that much.  Also, in higher doses (450mg), it could make me emotionless and my hands extremely shaky, to the point that I could barely eat.  It helped me feel a little better for a while, but it didn’t really do much.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

The wellbutrin, along with Pristiq, Valium, and Neurotin I am FINALLY myself!! I honestly thought my life was going to be miserable and I was a lost cause because I tried EVERY medication known to man and nothing worked. But the wellbutrin gave me the extra ""umph"" I needed. For the first week I could feel the medicine ""kicking in"". But now I dont, and my days are okay. And remember...what works for one person, may not work for another. I thank God everyday that I finally have the right combination. So if there are people reading this and you feel like just giving up, don't. You just have to keep moving forward with life."

I have been suffering from depression for several years now while working through marital problems.  I also have Graves' Disease and had my thyroid removed, that resulted in a paralyzed vocal cord which I have just had surgery to repair. I also have been through menopause. My doctor decided to change me from Zoloft to Wellbutrin 2 weeks ago.  The first few days I felt much better - more energy but  able to sleep better than I had in years. After the first week I was to increase to twice daily. Since then I have noticed dizziness that last all the time, unable to think clearly, words not coming out right,  hot flashes, and still having depression and crying spells at night time.  Not sure what to do.  I suppose I will give it a couple more weeks and then follow up with my physician.

Now they say I am so much happier and calmer. What a surprise is I have stopped smoking! What a wonderful side effect.

I slowly increased my dose over 6 years until I was at the heights dose possible. I had no problems with the medication until last year. I had a seizure, but was alone and didn't know if I had dreamt it or passed out or what. 6 months later I had another, and luckily my boyfriend was with me. He said it was a full blown grand mal seizure and I was quickly brought to the ER. The MDs weren't concerned and told me to stop taking Wellbutrin, which I did. Currently, I haven't had any seizures to date. I just wanted to put a warning out there to users (especially with high dosages) not to disregard the warning about the seizures!! "

At first, I had typical side effects and managed well - dry mouth, metallic taste in my mouth, trouble sleeping. I did experience the benefits of the medication almost immediately after starting to include increased energy. However, on the seventh day after the second dose, I had an allergic reaction about three hours later - due to, according to the doctor, the compounding effect of the medication. I began feeling itchy and had problems with my throat. I could breath and swallow, but my throat felt constricted and like I had a lump in the back. It was very scary and caused me to panic. I called emergency and saw my doctor, who discontinued the medication immediately. My throat is fine, but I still feel a little itchy. That will pass as the medication gets out of my system.

I share this because while allergies are rare, they can happen and if they do, call your doctor immediately. I know that everyone reacts to medications differently and am hopeful that my experience is unique and that others have a positive experience.

It also dramatically increased my appetite and caused a lot of weight gain (not solely because of increased appetite); my blood pressure and cholesterol increased.

Though I am experiencing some mild side effects (memory issues, weird taste in my mouth, some muscle pain in my neck and restlessness at night) overall I do feel it is helping. Due to menopause issues, I was dealing with severe depression and anxiety. The anxiety is completely gone, even in this short amount of time!  I still experience the depression, however it is less than it was. Also, the intense cravings for sweets is gone, though I have not lost weight as others have on Wellbutrin.  I'm assuming it (the lessening of the depression) will continue to improve as the weeks go by. I know it takes a while for the clinical dosage to really start working. Considering the good experience I'm already having, I will continue with Wellbutrin. My doctor is working closely with me to make sure all goes well. I don't always handle medications well so we will see how this goes. I have not experienced the increased sexual desire that others talk about and quite honestly, I am hoping and praying that I  never do!

I need the higher dose, but won't risk getting gum disease. That's too bad because it's good for energy and it doesn't effect your sex life like other antidepressants.

I used to be in such a bad mood and so tired after work everyday which was not good for my kids or husband.  I also crave chocolate badly when I'm feeling stressed.  I take 100mg at 6:00 am and another 100mg at 2:00 pm and it makes a HUGE difference in my mood, energy level, and diminishes my cravings for chocolate.  I think the thing I like the MOST about Wellbutrin is how I now have energy ALL DAY LONG.  I used to be so tired all the time even though I was not depressed... the tiredness would actually MAKE me depressed at times.  Now I have enough energy that even after a long day of work I can make dinner, bathe my kiddos, clean up the kitchen, and do other house hold tasks that I was too tired to do in the past.

What I don't like about Wellbutrin is that it dehydrates me and causes a lot of muscle pain if I don't drink three to four 16oz bottles of water a day.  Juice, soda, etc, don't count either... it has to be water.  The good news is that if I DO start feeling muscle pain I just quickly drink 16oz of water and within an hour or two I usually feel normal again. However, the massive energy boost and the other positives of this medication make the extra effort to drink water worth it in my opinion!"

This is an amazing drug in terms of how quickly it starts working.  However, it WILL make some people lose their hair.  I am a 32 year old woman and used to have very thick hair.  In a period of 6 or 7 months I lost 1/2 of my hair, if not more.  No bald spots or anything because I discontinued.  (For those of you who are dealing with hair loss, yes it will grow back when you quit.  But it takes quite a while...  Here I am a year later and decided to try SR instead of XL.  Hair loss started once again within 2 weeks.  Decided to quit week 3 because my hair is still nowhere near as thick as it was before, even with it growing back.  This sucks!  Wellbutrin really is awesome.  It helps you lose weight and is awesome for your sex drive/orgasms.  Trying buspar now...

I have been on it for about 5 weeks.  The only issue is that over the last few days I have been experiencing extreme muscle soreness/stiffness and joint pain/stiffness.  If it doesn't go away, I will have to stop the med.  Having just read a lot of the other reviews, I realize that I am a bit foggy in the morning, I experience dizziness for about 1/2 hour, an hour or so after taking it, and I am having trouble spelling!

I had nearly every side effect possible. I was always nauseous, was very shaky, had ringing in the ears, and was disgusted by food. I had to force myself to eat, would eat a few bites and be full, and was hungry again in an hour, just to repeat the cycle. I was so used to not eating that much that one day I had completely forgotten to eat. By 9pm I realized it, forced some soup down, and puked it up within 2 hours. I started with 150mg and eventually up-ed it to 300mg. I wanted so much for it to work. After 5 months of no results I decided to go off of it. I had lost the weight I wanted, but was continuing to lose weight at a dangerous rate. I don't blame the drug; everyone's body is different and will have different reactions. Just wish it would have worked for me! Good luck to everyone and I hope you have better results than I did.

Obviously each person may have different side effects. I believe really wanting to quit smoking is key. These pills definitely make me unable to smoke when I freak and break down to have a Cig it is absolutely gross tasting and makes me sick. So after a few attempts its effects have made me not want one. The mental effect is weird Tho. I'm very mellow. My attention to detail is strange. I prefer a clear unmedicated state.  Can.'t sleep without sleeping aid. Also curbs my appetite so discourages me from eatting constantly in place of smoking and becoming fat. I think I'll contine a week or two at most. Keep busy and re do my routine to help my ""habit"". I think this pill works for quitting. IF you want to quit. Good luck to me and all! Choose life! Its hell its hard its hard as hell.

My anxiety has returned and my new doc (accidentally) prescribed the XL... WOAH! It made me very very nauseous! However, now I am back on the SR and feeling GREAT again. It is the only thing that has ever helped me for any length of time, and it doesn't bother my stomach. Sure, the first few weeks are an adjustment (a little bit of dizziness, etc) but after that it really really works wonders for me. PS: I have tried Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, and most recently Cymbalta - all of which either did nothing or made me feel sick or totally wacko. And the Welbutrin seems to relax me enough to where my IBS isn't as bad, and also lessens general pain (such as back pain). It's worth a try!!!

227$Condition: Depression$6/22/2011 4:50:43 AM$Reviewer: B-Ok, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$4$"Started on 150mg for a week, then 300mg for most of the 19 months since then. Paxil was my 1st poison, but the mental fog was too much for me. Tried Lexapro and Celexa for relapses, but.. didn't work. They just kept me 'comfortably numb' enough to get on with my life. Wellbutrin, on the other hand, contributed to a positive change in my outlook. I'm about to finish a graduate program for a professional degree I used to think was way beyond my capabilities. In addition to the degree, I'm in a fairly stable & supportive relationship (not the abusive, drunken ones of my youth), and have picked up 5K's as a recent hobby. Lost about 30 lbs within the 1st year. 
My major downfall is remembering to take my meds everyday at the same time. When I do forget, it takes about 48 hours for the creepy crawling feelings to start clouding my mind, and those are hard for me to shake off. About 4 months ago, I was struggling with my need to take antidepressants, and convinced myself that I could do just fine without any help from therapy + meds. Needless to say, I had a major meltdown within days that took 2 1/2 months of work to finally get ahead. 
Now, 5 weeks back on generic bupropion, I'm realizing the benefits I was afforded with this treatment - alert, focused, driven, confident - I felt more like the person I want to be, plus I have a healthy sex drive. Also, I never, ever want to go through withdrawal again, so I'm declining a recent Rx for Pristiq and all SSRI/SNRIs for as long as possible. I take 2 x 150mg pills everyday before 12pm, to take advantage of the elevated mood + energy boost and ability to really sleep afterwards. I still have my low moments, but I do recover with learned techniques & support."

Unfortunately I have to stop taking it because I have a meningioma ( benign ) tumor of the brain and wellbutrin may be the cause of seizures around the area of the tumor.

I was taking (at first) 1-150mg AM,  I has relayed to my doctor that I really really needed to quit smoking, so he says ""ok!"", ""lets up your dose to 1-150mg AM and then 1-150 at noon. (For a few days, he says.) 4 or 5 days later, I went to 300mg AM and 150 at noon. I carried on (with life) as if nothing was happening. Then about 2 maybe 2 1/2 months into the 450mg daily, I woke up one day and started doing my 'honey do's (like always), but this time, i noticed it was almost noon and I hadn't lit a cigarette all day! Well dam, (i'm thinking) I haven't even wanted one all day. I didn't quit all at once. I went from a pack a day to 1/2 pack. THAT DAY. stayed with 1/2 pack  for about a week. Maybe.  From there, i went from 1/2pack 10 a day to 8 and then 7. From 7 to 5, then down to 4 a day. I kinda go stuck of 3 for a few more days than i thought I would but, i climbed the hill anyways and i was now at two a day. For a few days. And then 1. a day. For a few days. Then finally, I had one last cigarette in my car and i smoked it maybe 1/2 down,...and pitched it out the window.  From day one until I lit my last one was about 4 weeks.  But it wasn't the nicotine i was having to break myself from. The Wellbutrin had completely removed all urges and cravings for nicotine. The hardest part with stopping to smoke with Wellbutrin,was the 'breaking' of my old habits. I was well on my way of ridding myself of smoking, My only obstacle was ""what to do with my hands???"" For so long, if i  got on the phone, lite it up. ON the computer, lite it up. Driving down the road in my car,...lite it up. sitting on the front deck, watch the birds fly by,...lite it up! But after I got past all that 'easy' stuff, i was and AM on my way to a much healthier body. For my Grandchildren sake. It's been 5 months this past March 5th. I'm really, really proud of myself. "

If you are depressed with overeating, irritability, and excess sleepiness, try this. If you have a tendency to addictive behaviors, try this.
If you are anxious, can't sleep, have lost weight, or have high blood pressure - do not take this med. It will make things worse.

I've always struggled a little with SAD (winter blues) but last year my mom was struggling with a second bout of cancer and it was just too much. I felt life was blah, nothing to look forward to, no energy and crying at the drop of a pin. I started on 150mg. which took the edge off but 300mg. made all the difference! I now feel content and calm. I don't get agitated so easily or so stressed over kids, job or life. after 26 years of marriage our sex life is great. I've been loosing weight easily.I feel queasy if I eat a full meal. It's better to eat smaller portions more often. now I don't overeat. I do feel light headed a bit when I stand too quickly. I have more energy, feel more alert and wake up so much easier than I have my whole life.. I've never been a morning person. I had ""de ja vue"" seizures several years ago but this has not brought them back. I do have a harder time staying focused and feel a little ditzy or forgetful at times. all in all I really feel so much better and will stay on it even though mom is doing better because of the calmness and contentment and change in appetite I now have."

I am working full-time, but it is difficult due to the toll the depression and GAD has taken on my memory and concentration.  I'm taking 300 mg Wellbutrin, 100 mg Trazadone, and .05 Xanax as needed for anxiety/panic attacks.  I've tried almost every other anti-depressant - alone and in conjunction with Wellbutrin - and couldn't handle the side effects due to a medical disorder that I also have.  I thought Wellbutrin was a decent compromise - I still have bad days and crying spells, but I wasn't aware of any side effects.  HOWEVER... Wellbutrin's side effects crept up on me.  I have very, very thin hair now.  And in just the past two months I have a new side effect -- the inner tops of my ears have turned a dusky green/blue shade.  Anyone else with this side effect?  My doctor doesn't know what to make of it.  I attribute it to the Wellbutrin because my daughter also takes it, at the 450 mg level, and her ears started turning before mine did.  This is the only med we have in common.

No noticeable side effects. It must address the correct brain chemical. All the SSRIs I tried didn't work well.

Also, I take my Wellbutrin in one dosage first thing in the morning; Iknow this is not recommended, but it works for me. I have done this for 15.5 years without problems.

If I take it after 12noon it keeps me up at night.

I also breakout in a bad case of hives (hands, groin, feet) when I take KEFLEX while on Wellbutrin. This never happened with Keflex prior to getting on Wellbutrin...go figure.... obviously don't take Keflex anymore. I never could find any info on this interaction.

Are there any studies on the ramifications of really long-term usage?"

298$Condition: Depression$8/27/2010 9:49:10 PM$Reviewer: anxiousgirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$4$4$3$I have chronic anxiety and panic disorder, but do not normally feel depressed. For some reason docs always prescribe anti-depressents, which usually make me VERY depressed. I hate having to choose between panic attacks and morbid depression. Finally found that tiny amounts of lorazepam (.5mg) as needed help stop most panic attacks, but anxiety was still constant. Doc thought wellbutrin might help, since SSRI's etc. just kill me with depression. She thought since I seem compulsively anxious, and wellbutrin is sometimes prescribed for OCD, it was worth a try. First two weeks I felt much better, but eventually the dose at 150mg./day made me desperately depressed. But a month after I stopped, I was back to feeling out of my skin. So now the past 3 weeks I take 1/2 of a 75 mg. pill of buproprion twice per day, morning and mid-afternoon. I feel so much better! And I've already lost 3 pounds, don't feel either anxious or depressed, just basically calm. Can't tell you what a relief that is. I am thirsty and have some constipation, but those side-effects are worth it. I am very sensitive to medications, and this small dosing is working for me. For me, reducing dosage was the key.

I had more energy and focus as an added bonus.  I was able to quit for almost 2 years while on the drug.  I began smoking again after a year off the drug, so I recently began taking the generic version.  For the past 3 days, I have not been able to get to sleep for 4-5 hours after laying down.  I have no appetite and I cry at the drop of a hat.  I don't remember having any of these symptoms when I last used this medication.  I have read some of the comments and I am not the only one with these issues.  I keep taking it because I figure it's better than smoking. After 3 days on the meds, the thought of a smoke makes me nauseated.  I have lit up a few times out of sheer habit in the car and have not been able to finish one without gagging.

I experienced several side effects including not being able to sleep, irrational thoughts and behavior, paranoia and severe anxiety. I was experiencing a great deal of stress in my personal and professional life and thought that these symptoms were a result of the stress i was experiencing. It took me six weeks to realize that the medication was causing my anxiety and paranoia. I had several sleepless nights, and one day following one of these nights, i went to work and had an ""episode"" with my supervisor who thought I had gone crazy. I’m just hoping that my actions and behaviors won’t effect my position, probably a little late for that. I can say that the medication did seriously curb my desire to smoke, but I don’t feel that the benefits out-weighed the costs, I  would never recommend this drug to anyone for smoking cessation."

Adding this medication has given me the first sustained relief I have had from depression.  I have been diagnosed with long-term low level depression.  I have had some sleep disturbance and some joint aches.  They have varied in intensity and if the joint aches had not improved my doctor would probably have removed me from the medication.  But I would gladly lose a little sleep in order to finally know what it feels like to not be depressed.  It is wonderful and even great to be tired because of a little loss of sleep rather than just plain tired of life and dragging through my days.

Although I was seeing a psychiatrist I was drinking, smoking, gambling, mildly depressed and had constant mood swings. Within a month of taking this medicine all my addictions were gone. I just don't have the strong urges anymore and can rationalize and control my decisions. I don't look at food the same either sometimes I just don't eat at all (no hunger pains). The best thing about the medicine is that I have lost 20 pounds with exercise. The worse thing is that I have developed an addiction to sweets I didn't have before. All in all I am a better person when taking the drug even though a couple of times I have experienced a day of two of sadness but nowhere near like before. It has been seven months and I am much happier about my life. Wellbutrin is not for everyone and the side effects were very prominent for the first six weeks but went away.  Thank God for this medicine.

About a year ago my doc added Wellbutrin to my regular Zoloft. I had been taking Zoloft for several years and I believe she started it to add to my energy, as it was low, and also to possibly help reduce my appetite. I had been trying for several years to lose weight and still had carb cravings and no weight loss. The first month I took it I lost 10 pounds, and since then have lost ten more. I did feel much more energetic (not manic, but normal)and became more active and was able to get more things done in my home and elsewhere.  Not only have I been treated for serotonin deficiency (for many years)last year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, which also causes fatigue. Wellbutrin has helped, but my dosage was just increased to the highest level, so I hope it remains effective as there is no where ""higher"" to go if my body becomes accustomed to this dosage and then the drug becomes less effective than before.

I was put on 75mg a day for a week and bumpped up to 150mg after a week.  During the first week I noticed I was sweating much more and actually feeling more anxious.  I thought this would go away after the first week or once I bumpped up to the higher dosage.  It didn't.  I became much more irritable and anxious.  Cryed at the littlest of things and would go off over stupid things.  I think my husband thinks I have turned into a crazy woman and he doesn't know why.  Additionally I do not sleep well.  Put a call into the doc, hope she has a solution.  I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions.

333$Condition: Depression$5/23/2010 3:35:56 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$2$Wellbutrin has certainly elevated my mood, making me a whole lot more functional. There's a couple side effects I don't like though. Under normal day-to-day activities I don't feel any dizziness, I'm a ballet dancer, and I've noticed that chaine turns and pique turns (basically spinning really fast across the floor) are markedly a lot more difficult, and sometimes I have to sit down in class because the dizziness is overwhelming. This of course is extremely frustrating, I'm one of the strongest dancers in my group, but this is holding me back. I also have a ringing in my ears. I take 150mg twice a day, and I don't like monitering the time so closely to be sure I take them on time. But at least for now, I feel much better than I did before, so I'm not ready to give up on it yet.
334$Condition: Depression$5/22/2010 10:28:56 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$3$Wellbutrin has been very effective for me in that it gives me a boost of energy, easier to get out of bed in the morning, and my social anxiety is a whole lot easier to deal with. I started taking it because my best friend died recently and I was having the most difficult time in the world getting the most basic things done, I never wanted to go out in public, it was extremely painful to do homework and go to class, etc. I've always been a bit prone to depression anyway, but this is the worst it's ever been. I used to take Zoloft, but I didn't like it for 2 reasons, firstly, it took away my sex drive, and secondly, it made me permanently in a good mood, I lost my natural range of emotion. Wellbutrin hasn't done that for me at all, I feel much more like myself, it's still possible to have a bad day and I'm ok with that, I think it's healthy. Of course I'm still grieving my friend very much, it happened only 3 months ago, so I still cry almost everyday, but now it's just for a few minutes and it doesn't completely engulf me. As for the sex drive, oh god, it's increased exponentially, sometimes I need to have sex several times a day or I go a little bit crazy, it's my boyfriend's dream come true. If I wasn't in a relationship it would be a very bad thing!! There's a couple unfortunate side effects: I've lost weight, for most people this is a much desired side effect, but I was already in perfect shape and didn't need to lose any weight. Also, I can't get to sleep at night, so my doctor also prescribed Ambien, which works just fine. The most annoying side effect is the constant ringing in my ears, most the time I can forget and not notice it, but when I do it kind of drives me crazy. And the final side effect is occasional constipation, which is always horrible for anyone. Before I go to bed I drink senna leaf tea, and that works very well, it's pretty powerful stuff.

HOWEVER, there are differences within the generic brand (Bupropion). I recently switched drug stores where my prescription is filled and received a different ""type"" of the same drug. Before I was taking 300XL of an oval-shaped white pill. The ones I just received are 300XL but round white pills. And I feel a distinct difference. 

In fact, I feel like I'm going through the initial first stages of taking the drug all over again (dry mouth, restlessness, jitters). I understand that different companies make the generics but I cannot find a site that states which company has better quality products.  

Overall, Wellbutrin is, IMO, one of the better anti-depressants out there. "

The birth control killed my sex drive, made me gain 30 pounds (I was tall and thin before), ruined my sleeping habits,  made me extra moody, and caused a lot of anxiety.  I felt like I couldn't think clearly any more and I couldn't reason as well - things just weren't connecting in my head.  I didn't want to go off the birth control because of awful cramps so my doctor started me on this drug.  The first few days I felt nauseous and my head felt like it was in a vice.  Within a few days I was feeling fine.  I can think clearly, my sleep has got better, I've gained a little of my sex drive back, and I lost some of the weight I had gained because of the birth control.  I am finally feeling more like myself.  I haven't really had any side affects except increased sensitivity to light.  I am very satisfied with it.

Hit the wall again and new doc suggested Wellbutrin, not the long acting kind, at a small dose, 75mg, in the am and so far i'm impressed. I did experience a little sleepiness (yeah, backwards i know, but bipolar brains don't get the same side effects often)...but I also don't feel 'numb', like other treatments...i am flushing some, but will ask the doc about that at next visit and not worth stopping...very hopeful, which is nice...if u'r bipolar and in depression ask u'r doc about buproprion not the xl or sr in the am....good luck to all!

Then my bp was 136/100, which is extremely high, as i usually run at 120/80. My arm went completely numb as if it were asleep, and it felt like pins and needles in my hand. My heart beat was also showing arythmia.
  I felt like I was ready to crawl out of my skin, cause of this overwhelming panic feeling. I ended up vomiting 4 times in a period of 30 mins. It was the most terrible feeling in the world, and I seriously thought I was going to die of a stroke. I have been ordered to completely stop taking this med.

I am taking 300mg 2x per day and wow, what a difference it has made in my life. As soon as I started taking it I felt a burst of energy I had not experienced in quite a while. I did not realize how depressed I truly was until I felt normal again. I still have my bad days but they are normal bad days, not suicidal bad days. For the first three weeks my side effects included heart palpitations, excess energy,  a bit of anxiety, and occasional insomnia. Now I experience a little bit of dizziness and anger issues. I am a little irritable and get angry easier. The benefits definitely outweigh the symptoms.

I have fought depression for 25 years.  It worsened with pregnancy and marriage to a very narcisstic partner.  I have taken many combinations of SSRIs most have been ineffective until I added Welbutrin.  I have found the generic versions to be much less effective and have had to switch to the Welbutrin SR and XL versions over time in order to continue with the brand name drug.  Overall, Welbutrin has kept me out of bed and functioning because it keeps the mental fog at bay and gives me much needed energy.  The Lexapro augments my symptoms be keeping the suicidal thoughts away and reduces my anxiety.  So, overall Welbutrin has helped me to keep functioning despite a very depressing marriage.  My new insurance will not allow me to continue my current dosages and I am afraid that things will slip back.  Does anyone have suggestions as to handle the insurance limitations?

I have to go off of it because I can not take the side effects. Dry mouth, tremors, anxiety attacks and the worst headache of my life that has not gone away in 5 days. I can not even open my right eye for more than a few seconds because the pain is so intense.

I was taking 150mg for the first week and then the second week I went up to 150 mg twice a day. My skin started to crawl, I turned mean as a snake and yelled at everyone. Forget sleeping. I have had none in over a week. All I do is lay in bed and pray that this intense pounding in my head will go away.

I know some people think that you need to give it more time, but before I was taking this I was just a bit down feeling. Now I am both depressed and anxious and in constant pain and I can't even leave my house.

So my experience with this drug has not been a good one at all. Now I am worrying about any repercussions I may have coming off of it. Hopefully, since I was not on it but a few weeks the withdrawal will not be too bad.

If you suffer from any type of anxiety disorder I would strongly suggest that you do NOT take this medication. "

396$Condition: Depression$1/14/2010 9:59:35 PM$Reviewer: xbabyx, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 14. I tried various medications with little success and many negative side-effects (weight-gain, fatigue, loss of interest/listlessness, etc). For several years i tried to handle my symptoms on my own, and I tauhgt myself how to handle my anxiety attacks but the depression and general anxiety weren't improving. Shortly before I turned 18 I began cognitive behavioral therapy once a week, and a drug regimine to control my symptoms. She prescribed a few different medications along the way to try to find one that worked for me, and one of the trials was Wellbutrin. My mother had taken it with good results, so I consented. After about 3 days I was forced to stop taking the pills - my depression and anxiety had gone from distracting but not over-whelming to literally life-threatening in 72 hours. I began self-mutilating (a habit I had managed to break myself of during my pill-less years) and became incredibly paranoid, agitated, angry, depressed, and I isolated myself from everyone and everything. Again, all within 72 hours! I am not saying this medication is horrible and should never be used by anyone, I just want to share my story so everyone knows that yes it can work (like for my mother), but it might not and might actually be dangerous (like it was for me). So always be sure to discuss any concerns you have with your doctor, beginning or continuing a medication is a big decision and it could have serious effects on your health and your life both positive or negative. Be careful, and good luck!

I have also been diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar Disorder so I thought that this might be something to try. well after takeing it for about a week I had a severe allergic reaction. I personally caution all of you that are considering taking this drug for something like quitting smokeing please talk with your doctor about some of the severe side affects to this drug. For me it went well for the first week until i started feeling anxious and a feeling of impending doom. Next came the chest pain and pounding heart. The next day I awoke to find my hands and feet swollen to the point i couldn't wear my gloves or boots. I also had a rash over my entire body and hives. I have stopped taking the medication but 5 days later I am still having trouble breathing a rash and hives. I have been forced to take large doses of several drugs in order to try to combat this reaction to include Epenephrine Benedryl and Prednisone. To let you all know i was the guy that never worried about side affects. I work in the medical field and i was able to monitor my condition and take the right steps in order to treat my condition. If you have any of these side affects don't do like i did go to the ER IMMEDIATELY these are symptoms of what can be a deadly allergic reaction. but pleas don't blow off you doctor when he tells you about side affects listen to them. I will say this though I quit smoking and it works well for that and i felt great most of the time i was on it.

Lowering the dosage helped. BUT... I still didn't have any motivation to actually get up and do anything. So my psychiatrist suggested this. Can I say wow?? The first day, I got the jitters, like when you've had too much coffee, that lasted a couple of hours, then I never had them again. It also has made me slightly nauseous, which increases with dosage increase. I'm currently taking half of a 75mg pill, because taking a whole one made extremely nauseous. Now, after a month on a half, the nausea is almost completely gone. It also does control my appetite. I eat way less and my usual ""grazing"" doesn't happen anymore. yay! I'm very happy on this medication. If you're  having the extreme side effects, talk to your doctor. coudl be the dosage is too high. "

I tried psychotherapy for 3 months without much help.  Reluctently, I told my physician about my state of mind during a routine visit and she recommened Wellbutrin.  After about 2 weeks on the med the fog lifted from my head and once again I feel joy.  Though I do experience a slight dry mouth side effect, I am also experiencing a decrease in appetite which is actually a benefit as I have always had to closely watch my calories in order to maintain my slender figure.  I plan on remaining on the drug until springtime (I live in the PacNW and the nonstop winter rain is enought to make anyone depressed!) and will slowly wean myself off.

It's been 10-years since my last smoke. I still use Wellbutrin 150mgx2, which seems like a pretty light dose. Still, if I don't take it I feel many of the symptoms reported on this blog. Times are getting tougher for me now (and the rest of the world too) and I'm thinking 150mg may need to be increased. I hope I can cope with dosage and not by changing to another drug...this one really works for me.   In fact, I think if I had something like Wellbutrin when I was (much) younger, I would have had fewer problems. I've only found one thing better than Wellbutrin....membership in a gym.

Hadn't felt that good since I was a kid! Was told it'd take about 3-4 wks to take effect-only took 3-4 DAYS! Then, it beagn to wane-unfortunately. It was by far the BEST antidepressant/a.d.d. drug I've ever taken. I'm on NOTHING now,tried 'em all-they work pretty o.k. for awhile, and then--nothing. (thats just MY experience though) My point is to just give Wellbutrin a TRY. Even if you get ONLY 3 months-thats 3 GREAT months that you'd have.

After that, it slowly began to go back to my old ""normal"" (abnormal)? self. I was heartbroken! My Dr. explained that this sometimes happens and that believe it or not the drug was still working. No-it wasn't. ALL of the old symptoms re-appeared. If they could only find a way to make the effects of this drug last, SO many people with the same problems could be helped. I should add that I also had (still do)chronic fatigue(it's a.d.d.-NOT a.d.h.d.)chronic pain & fibro. Wellbutrin was amazing! I should also add that I took it BEFORE it was used as a smoking cessasion drug and it DID help me to cut WAY back on cigarette consumption!(Who knew)?

People: take the medication exactly as prescribed. If the side effects are too strong, tell the dr., but just because you get certain side effects at certain dosages, doesn't mean it doesn't work. This has been great for me! I was taking prozac before for YEARS. I have been taking Wellbutrin now for about 1-1/2 years. Don't review it if it's been 2 days or 2 weeks!! I've never known an anti-depressant that works that soon. Obviously, the major things you should report to your dr and maybe the dose needs to be decreased. I know, been there, done that. This decreased my apetite (I gained with prozac) and improved the sex drive (great for my marriage). I felt mental clarity and I felt like ""me"" which I hadn't felt in years. One of my first reactions was, ""Man! I missed myself."" I have so much more energy (which as you know with depression is horrible). My dr initially recommended that I work my way up to 4 a day (2 am, 2pm), but that was too much and I felt some of the things others have described (suicidal thoughts-never felt that before this). I didn't like the two doses a day. I'm only taking one and it's okay. My drs told me what symptoms I may feel and were great about following up. Yes dry mouth and funny taste, but I didn't jet the ""jitteriness"" that they said I might. Do a ""google"" search for it, there's a website where people review this after more than 2 days of taking it...lol :)"

It really did not do anything for the condition for which I was taking it.  The doctor took me off of it and shortly thereafter, I experienced anxiety, a problem that I had not had previously.

One of those areas was starting Wellbutrin for ADD and mild depression. My angel of a marriage counselor suggested I look into it. The side effects I experienced were dry mouth and a little trouble sleeping. I have also lost about 10 lbs which may not be a good thing since I was already very thin. I very rarely feel hungry. Wellbutrin has worked great for the ADD. It is very subtle but I just feel so much more competent and on top of things. I used to forget something important on a daily basis. I am no longer depressed, but it's hard to say whether it's the meds or the life changes. I wasn't sure if I was depressed until I started taking this drug. Now I know I was. I am really glad my Dr gave me this instead of a more comman ADD med. Again, it could be the life changes, but I just feel very ""at home"" in my life."

I was stoked at first to have no side effects, but last night, I noticed what I thought was some dry mouth and when I was trying to sleep, my restless leg syndrome (which is mild) was worse, and I felt sort of like I had a mild electric current running thru my entire body. Today, the dry mouth is definitely there (bummer), and I seem to be developing a slight tremor. Also feel slightly nauseated and am having anxiety issues.  I get headaches a lot, so it's hard to tell if the headache I've got today is from the drug or just me. If this is as bad as it gets, I'll keep taking it, but the seizure thing is making me nervous, what with the feeling of an electric current running through me. I'm gonna tough it out and see if it gets better; I realize there's a period of adjustment, and I really want this drug to work, since it doesn't cause problems with weight & sex drive.  I am perimenopausal, and it might be making the hot flashes worse, though. That SUCKS.

483$Condition: Depression$8/13/2009 10:33:30 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$4$Taking 300 mg for three months now and have felt much better. My Dr. would like to up this dosage to 450, however I'm not comfortable with this dosage - have tried this higher does for a few days and could not handle it. With the 300 mg/ first few weeks my fingers twitched but this passed. My sex drive has improved , started going to yoga and pilates classes on a reg. bases. Stopped sneaking back to bed after dropping the kids off at school and smile more. Infact I sleep less and feel okay. Need to eat prior to taking and if I take the medication in the afternoon sleep is difficult that night. Have tried paxol - 3yrs ago for postpardom depression- symptoms - fell asleep while sitting up on the couch, that's more than just tired and lost my sex drive completely. Different people metabolize medication differently. My Dr. now wants to add Lexapro to the mix - not to sure about this which is why I'm doing my research. Also was prescribed clonazepam, however I have only taken three pills in the three months and only a half pill each time. They make me feel high; a little to good.

Once I started to feel like it wasn't working for me so my MD told me to take 200mg twice a day; but found it to cause dizziness and  a feeling like I was going to pass out, had difficulty driving.  So I cut back to 100mg bid, and those sx immediately went away.  Funny thing was, though, my MD didn't think the Wellbutrin had anything to do with it; but I had just increased the dosage about 2 weeks prior and it went away immediately when I cut back.  I made sure my MD knew this.  Then after talking to a friend, I tried 200mg at bedtime.    This works best for me. I even lost 20 lbs. I would recommend it; just make sure you are advocating for you.  If you don't agree with your dr, tell them!!

However, I was eventually prescribed 300mg bid and ended up having a grand mal seizure (1st seizure) at work.  This medication's seizure threshold lowering properties likely had a role in inducing this seizure, so I am no longer taking it.  It does significantly increase sex drive (which can lead to poor decisions by some...), but this wasn't too much of an issue for me.  Great medication, except for the seizure.

Not with Wellbutrin.  I love it.  My head is clear and I feel so much better.  There are two things that I have discovered.  One thing that I have noticed about it is that I really need to take it at the same time everyday.  I take 450mg, two pills in the morning and one in the evening.  If I'm an hour or so late on one of my doses, I get a little cranky, but it goes away shortly after I take my dose.  I also have noticed that I don't sleep as long.  But I seem to still be well rested most of the time, even when I only get 4 hours of sleep.  It beats the drowsiness I felt with the other meds.

In the past, I have been on Prozac and Paxil. Wellbutrin (incl. generics) has vastly exceeded the other drugs in effectivness for me. Tho there were side effects at one time, off and on for awhile, including some mild agitation and slight anxiety, and moderate or substantial agitation and irritation at higher dosages, they have gone away almost 100%. Currently, after re-engaging at the higher dose (150 mg SR 2x a day, previously was on 150mg SR 1x/day) I have had almost no side effects, certainly none that are substantially disturbing. And for probably the first time in 40 years I find my depressive symptoms dramatically reduced, well below what I had previously thought of as 'normal' or 'complete symptom elimination.' I now feel that I was not aware of what normal is. For me, I believe my body needed some time to acclimate to the drug. However I am so happy with current status I wished I had tried the higher dose again sooner.

I had gastric bypass surgery so it is very important the meds I take are not known for causing weight gain.

I have also found that taking Wellbutrin in conjunction with Provigil helped me more than any other combination of medications.  Unfortunately I am unable to continue with Provigil because of the cost associated with it and not having insurance to assist with the cost."

I take it in the morning and it really does feel like it gives me a burst of energy. I was pretty depressed before and I had issues controlling my anger sometimes, and that is pretty much gone away now. I really like Wellbutrin.

After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

The side effects i've had is dry mouth, sore throat, and a weird taste in the morning and late at night.  I have also had insomnia but i suffered from that long before and my doctor has prescribed me a sleeping pill that works hand in hand with wellbutrin.  I have noticed that i have been feeling a little more jittery today since i have increased it but i will moniter and see if my amount is too much.  I believe that this will go away after a while though.  lastly i just wanted to add that i ate my feeling when i was depressed and while i am not horribly overweight i am a little and that was one of my biggest reasons for being depressed.  and slowly i am noticing my appitite and cravings going down and i think i am losing a little weight.  thank god!  but i recommend doing your homework and not settling but finding the right drug for you. before i took lexapro and it killed my sex life and i took cymbalta and it made me very dizzy and nauscious.  so i have finally found something that works FOR ME.

Didn't know people could ever feel this good, or be this focused & clear-minded.  DX over the past decade with PMDD, ADHD, Depression & SADD.  Also have Hashimoto's, and arthritis causing chronic pain & disturbed sleep.  

On Wellbutrin, I didn't implode from stress over the holidays, I'm not dwelling on things or blowing them out of proportion, anxiety is down, and my self-attitude is more positive.  I feel far more connected to people & interested in things, and I'm not procrastinating so much.

The combo of careful monitoring & tweaking my thyroid hormones, a daily progestin-only mini-pill to counter-balance high estrogen levels, a using a SADD lite box a few times a week, plus Wellbutrin, seems to be the answer for me.
  
I started on Wellbutrin @75 mg daily for 4 weeks, moved to 100 mg of XL daily 2 weeks ago.  Only side effect is getting a bit overheated while sleeping.  Normally I wear sweats, a nite cap & blanket set on High, so this is a good thing.  

Tried SSRIs - Zoloft, Prozac & Lexapro, plus Atenolol for anxiety/stress symproms, & Strattera for ADHD, but cardiovascular side effects were extreme, or left me feeling ""flat"" and apathetic, and had a major allergic reaction to Strattera."

My MD prescribed Wellbutrin last week at my request to help me quit smoking. Since taking Wellbutrin for about a week, it has overridden my anti-anxiety medication. I have experienced pounding heart-beat, agitation, frequent urination, inability to concentrate, and change in mood(irritable hypo-mania of my bipolar). I am calling my doctor in the morning to discuss these negative side-effects with him, and am quitting taking this Wellbutrin. I will try other methods of quitting smoking. The reason I asked for Wellbutrin is because when a person has a mood disorder like bipolar or depression, quitting smoking cold-turkey can cause severe depression and crying-spells. Just a note: this is my own personal experience with Wellbutrin. If you have an anxiety disorder and you want to quit smoking, please discuss with your MD the side-effects I have experienced. Please note that everyone reacts to meds differently, so this review I am giving is just an FYI.

The good effect I've had so far is a clarity in dealing with depressive thoughts and the appearance of optimistic thoughts- it has given me moreso the capacity to choose among them. The side effects, though, are infuriating. I feel constantly in a haze, dizzy, and less aware. My vision is a little blurred. I have mild headaches, but not near as bad as ones I got from SSRIs (prozac, lexapro, celexa). I feel somewhat nauseous. Reading takes a little more effort and I'm having a hard time spelling, which is really strange- not being able to pull the words forward, maybe because I have blurry vision and feel hazed over. Do the side effects normally go away with time? I hope so. I want badly for this drug to work.

I really didn't want to think I had something I couldn't take care of myself.  I started taking a low dosage of Wellbutrin (actually the generic) once a day about 2 months ago and it has worked very well for me.  The first couple of weeks I felt a little dazed and loopy and I have mild headaches every now and then but those seem to be the only side effects.  I actually lost a little weight when I started but now have come to a stand still in the weight area.  My overall mood has benefited greatly and I find myself enjoying life more and I take things in stride much better. My Dr. has suggested that I only stay on it for a few more months and then go off it which I think I will try as I hate being on a medication every day.  I do think I'll wait until Spring as I live in Upstate New York and our winters always depress me!  I found this sight because I'm looking for a cold medicine with a decongestant that I can take with Wellbutrin.  I don't like having to worry about drug interactions when I just want to take a simple cold tablet.  I would recommend this medicine to anybody that is looking for some releif from depression.

I was switched off of Paxil and Zoloft after SERIOUS weight gain was making me depressed (LOL).  Anyway, I take it for anxiety/OCD.  I am extremely satisfied with the effects of this drug.  I have none of the side effects that people mention.  To be honest, I have none of the side effects at ALL.  The only thing that I notice about this medication verses the others is that I have a little more energy, I don't feel like I am in a fog, and I have lost 4 pounds!  I am certainly not going to complain over THOSE side effects.  I can see where some people feel that they can't sleep.  With that in mind, I started taking my medication FIRST THING IN THE MORNING!  By evening, I have no problem sleeping at all.
My biggest word of advise to everyone is to remember that statistically, when people are complaining about something, they tell 10 people, but when they are satisfied with something, they tell one or two.  Don't allow the reviews to deter you from trying this medication, or any other medication that may help you live a normal life.  Try...and try again...until you find the one that works for you.  Wellbutrin is certainly the one that works for me.  I wish you the best of health!"

It was the one and only anti-depressant I was even willing to try based on the possible side-effects. Thankfully, it worked for me because I know many people have to try several different types of meds before they find the right one (or combination) that will work for them. I do recall that it took about six weeks for many of the initial side effects to go away; tingling sensation, bad taste in mouth, mild nausea, insomnia, etc. At the time, I was severely depressed/suicidal and suffered from PTSD as well. The initial bothersome side effects were minor compared to my critical emotional state, so I didn't focus on them too much. I'm glad for that now, because I could've easily decided that the drug wasn't working and found myself getting on the medication roller coaster that many people suffer through. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't taken this drug. The other thing that helped is that I didn't rely on medication alone. At my worst, I was seeing a counselor 2-3 times per week. Eventually, I was able to go on a very light dose (100mg 1xday), just as a preventative measure. That was 6 years ago. No recurrence of depression and I couldn't identify any side effects that are problematic if I tried. Severe, chronic depression runs in my familly and my first onset of this level of clinical depression was when I was just 9 years old, (I'm 45 now). One of my brothers was even younger. The only family members that are not struggling with severe depression are the ones that are on Wellbutrin. One family member changed meds (from Well to many others) because he couldn't deal with the insomnia and he spent the next 4 years spiraling down to the pits of hell. He went back on it 6 months ago and he's doing well. Yeah, I'm a big fan of Wellbutrin and a fortunate one at that. Good luck to those of you just embarking on recovery. My heart really goes out to you.

610$Condition: Depression$11/24/2008 11:31:25 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$I started with Wellbutrin XL, 150 mg/day. For the first two days it did help with the depression, but by day 3 I was totally wired: jittery, super anxious, unable to eat or sleep, felt like electricity was flowing to my finger tips, etc. I stopped and took an anti-anxiety med for a couple of days, just to be able to relax and sleep. Then switched to regular Wellbutrin: 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the afternoon. I think it does help with the depression but I still have ups and downs all the time. Overall feeling less gloomy and hopeless. However, it completely killed my appetite. I am never hungry. I try to eat more or less regularly, but have lost weight. The other side effect is almost constant, low grade nausea. My doc suggested increasing to 200 mg/day, but that just made the nausea worse. For now, I will stick with 150 mg/day. I also continue to take an anti-anxiety med (Clonazopan) at bedtime. I don't get more that 4 or 5 hours of sleep, but at least when I do wake up at 5 am, I feel calm and sometimes can even go back to sleep for a bit. I feel a bit tired during the day, but am not sure if it is because of lack of sleep or the Wellbutrin.

But if your insurance will only pay for a generic, make sure you ask for BUPROPRION, not BUDAPRION. The latter does not work! During my time on it, I started hurting myself again.

I have only been on it for about a month, and I am already seeing results. HOWEVER, this drug is making me lose my hair. Im a female by the way, and in most people's opinions losing your hair is worse when youre a woman. My hair started to thin at the top of my head. My whole life I have had very thick hair. My hair is completely thin now. I have a bald spot at the top of my hair. Im on the younger side for taking this drug, and i feel that by staying on this I will lose more and more. I have talked to other people who lost their hair also. So it's not just a weird side effect for me. I really do not understand why it is not listed as a side effect. I would personally most likely not prescribe this to someone for that reason.

The last 5 of these 14 years I've used the generic which seems erratic or not quite as good.  I take much less now, 100 mg/day, NEVER within 6 hours of bedtime.   Also, if you have any manic state of mind consult your doctor and read the package  info.  Tapering off of it is important if you want to stop it and a very gradual build-up is important if you are starting it.  This helps avoid headache. 
Also, I feel that it's often hard to concentrate, comparable to a little too much caffeine and would like to know more about others' experience."

Along with the shortness of breath and numb left arm.  The tightness in my chest is still there.  If it doesn't go away in the next hour, I am going to the ER. Obviously, this is not the drug for me.

I started this drug a month ago for anxiety and anger issues rolled into a little depression. The first week was heaven! I had more energy than I've had in a long time. As a matter of fact, I couldn't stop talking and was talking really fast as if my brain couldn't keep up with my mouth. I mean it was to the point where my mother thought I had been drinking because I am not usually much of a talker. Then the side effects got worse. I couldn't sleep and went 4 nights straight without sleeping. Benadryl, Tylenol PMC and Sominex didn't help. Finally called my MD and got a prescription for some Lunesta to help me sleep. On top of that, my hands shake like crazy and people are always asking me if I'm nervous, had dry mouth, headaches, slight nausea and the WORST of it is the acne. My face, chest, neck and back are broken out worse than it ever was when I was a teen (I'm 31.) I'm going to continue taking it but me and my doc are going to have a serious talk at my next appointment. If anyone else has had problems with the acne and talking nonstop, please email me at [email protected] and let me know if it gets better or worse.
650$Condition: Depression$8/8/2008 7:59:34 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$2$After being on Zoloft for about 4 years, I found it was no longer working. So my doctor had me titrate down on the Zoloft from 150mg to 50mg and add Wellbutrin, 150mg twice a day. Starte at just one dose (150mg) in the morning with no bad physical symptoms, although emotionally I was going through hell. Ever since bumping up to the second dose of 150mg, I have constant shortness of breath. Mood is a little better, but not enough to justify this shortness of breath. Also constantly yawning, sleeping poorly (waking up too many times, extremely vivid dreams, waking up too early). Going to talk to my doctor about it. I've read that this drug works better with people who only have depression. Never knew I was overly anxious before Wellbutrin, but beginning to think it is causing me to be so.

I wanted to eat and sleep way too much on zoloft, and gained several pounds over the last 3-4 yrs .  I also have an underactive thyroid, which may have caused me to gain a lot of the weight, but I felt STARVED all the time on zoloft..don't have the starved feeling anymore, which is nice and surely will help to drop a few pounds at least. Am concerned about the comments about seizures! anyone have any insight on my concerns or questions, please email me @ [email protected]  please put wellbutrin in the subject line or I most likely will delete as junk mail.

My heart raced and pounded, headaches were bad, had muscle twitching all the time, couldn't sleep at night, and felt nauseas at times. However, it helped me to stop being a smoker of ten years, increased my libido better than ever, and completely changed my outlook on life. I used to get agitated easily, be ""blue"" frequently, critical of others, and very insecure. It made me live for today, feel beautiful as I am and not care about other's judgements, including my own of myself and other people. The pounding heart and increased heart rate at the age of 23 scared me though, would I have my first heart attack by the age of 25? So after 8 weeks I dropped to 200 mg SR about a month ago, and already I am more agitated and have less of a libido. NEVER again will I pick up a cigarette, but I don't know how to make this drug effective without messing up my heart. I can deal with the muscle twitching and jitters, but I want to be good to my heart! Any suggestions?"

Zero panic attacks though (after having them about 20 times a day).  About two weeks ago, I began to feel ""down"" again, as school came to a close, and life was about to change.  I consulted my doctor, and he placed me on Welbutrin.  150mg for a week, and then up to 300mg.

I was DESPERATE to keep my marriage intact and to be a better mother. I walked around sad all the time with no desire or motivation for no reason at all. I also seemed angry all the time. 
At first, I was a little nauseus and a tiny bit dizzy, but the thing that I noticed most was that I was restless at night and my mind RACED and I could NOT shut it down! I didn't sleep much the 1st few nights so the pharamcist reduced my dosage to 150mg per day instead of 300mg (SR, not XL) and I could sleep again, felt less dizzy and less nauseus as the days went by until eventually I felt normal except for the dry mouth that I have 24/7.
 Recently I noticed after 2 months that it seemed to wane just a little and I felt some anxiety again. I asked the pharmacist about increasing my dosage. He put me on 200 mg per day about 3 days ago and WHAM! The nuaseusness hit full force today and I threw up and felt so dizzy that the room continued to spin and I could not function. I have been drinking a lot of water to flush it out of my system and I feel better now. He is now going to let me try 200mg per day in 2 doses 12 hours apart instead of just one big 200 mg dose all at one time.(I weigh less than 120 lbs so it was a bit much for me) Be patient, if you are taking it for less than a month, stay with it for a little longer, the side effects went away for me. 
My family members do not know that I am trying this. I noticed that I am much more relaxed and less obsessive about stupid little things and I think more clearly, have more energy, and am a bit more patient with my kids. It helped me to realize how today is important and to enjoy what I have now because  life is too short! I still feel anxious at times, but not like I used to be! Also, I am not so negative all the time and critical about others. 
I hope that it continues to work for me!
I wrote a lot in hopes of helping others.

Taking Wellbutrin together with Imipramine, the Wellbutrin has some kind of a reaction that does not allow the Liver to properly metabolize the Imipramine.  This happend to me.  I presented with all kinds of Neurological symptoms, but actually had VERY HIGH BLOOD LEVELS of imipramine even though my dosage had remained unchanged for over a year.  There is some actual medical research available to back this up, however, until recently this has not been a problem because these two drugs are not often prescribed together.

Mostly inattentive. Jittery for about 4 months. It buys me that extra second I need to keep from putting my foot in my mouth. 
  I wanted to try this as I detest the crash of the mainline ADD drugs. DR. also tells me there should be less of the dosage creep of adderal, etc.
  On 300 MG and happy as a clam. It also cured my cold sleeping. Went from 5"" of covers in July (GA) to sheet and single blanket. A very unexpected bonus and worth the price of admission alone.
  It does not do a lot for racing thoughts. It seems to give me the patience to put up with them. It does allow me to stop and remember where I put things. As a result, I can function much better out in my shop. (Less time looking for tools.) As a teacher it helps me handle the paperwork. 
  It won't solve all the ADD issues, but it is buying me time to ge back on track. ADD diagnosed age 8, 53 now. No drugs for last 32 years. Only script I take. Death of wife/ADD Coach knocked me out of sync. I am quite happy with things for now."

So far I do notice a loss of appetite, and nice as that is, I have to make sure at the end of each day that i have had enough to eat. This may have to do with taking concerta which also lowers appetite. I really don't feel jittery or anything. It defainetly gets my oversleeping under control and is great so far. I got sick during this time so it  is possible that some symptoms i had were related or lexapro withdrawal. These were headache, loss of consciousness (but i have low blood pressure), nausea, and ears popping. I don't know much else yet but so far it is working. It also has made me not need to smoke (which is great because i really shouldn't). It could be depression but i also feel like i am either over or under emotional. Don't know but it is better than oversleeping. I would take pretty much anything over that.

734$Condition: Depression$12/9/2007 8:20:06 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have struggled with depression my whole life and I am not 34. I have been one-and-off meds since 2000. In April 2007 I went back on the meds again. This time it was Zoloft, which made me feel terrific when it kicked in, but I gradually needed more and more until I (at 110 lbs) was at the maximum dosage of 200mg generic Zoloft (sertraline) by September 2007. So my psychiatrist added Wellbutrin, which seemed to help. Honestly, as someone who actually works as a license adolescent therapist and has a lot of experience with my own and treating depression.... the cycle never ends. You spend your whole life switching meds, gradually going off the meds, changing meds, and starting meds over. The best thing you can do is read a lot of books about depression and figure out what contributes to your depression. For me, I grew up with an alcoholic parents and basically walked on egg shells. You never knew if you'd be yanked out of bed by your hair in the middle of the night to wash dishes, you could never have a friend over and no matter what you did it was wrong. Research shows this actually interferes with your brain development and contributes to depression. Today, I have a busy career and I have to monitor how much I take on or I get angry and obsessive along with the depression. I can also say you need to marry someone who understands depression and is NOT depressed themselves. The spouse needs to be supportive and you need to have rules. One of our rules is that my husband will never walk away from me (because it sends me into a depressive rage). My husband also realizes that sometimes I say mean and nasty things to him that I would never say if I weren't having a depressive angry moment. It's hard. We have a toddler and my husband is an at home dad. We love our daughter and want her to have a parents at home, but it can't be me with my depression. My husband being at home help lessen my depression because it's less home-management for me. [email protected]

747$Condition: Depression$11/8/2007 2:39:23 PM$Reviewer: goofy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$3$I am taking Wellbutrin 300mg XL for depression. I tried Celexa and Paxil, but the sexual side effects were awful.  I tired Effexor and it created severe nausea and vomiting.  The problem I have with Wellbutrin is the feeling like throwing up, nauseau, and sometimes throwing up.  This only occurs in the evening.  It feels like morning sickness in the evening without being pregnant.  Does anyone have any suggestions of how to deal with the unpleasant side effects or how to minimze/eliminate them?

I've been taking 300mg of Wellbutrin XL daily and couldn’t be more satisfied with the results. I am less depressed, my obsessive thoughts have dramatically subsided and I have a better outlook on life. My wife is also ecstatic about the changes this drug has brought about in my mood and demeanor.

750$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/5/2007 10:54:08 PM$Reviewer: tycat17,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$This medication was an absolute nightmare for after the first month I was having suicidal thoughts, severe agitation, horrifying nightmares of being stabbed by knives, it was so awfull that I hardly slept at night and I could hardly concentrate and nothing seemed to work when I tried to focus on other things to block the horrifying nightmares and images that plagued my mind even in daytime hours. I complained to my physchiatrist about my symptoms seeming much worse on this med but she'd just smile and tell me to challenge these things and it was not the wellbutrin. I complained for 2 months. then one day I flipped out at work and began screaming like a lunatic at a co worker and then I pushed her. Needless to say 3 weeks later I was Fired! My glorious career and hard earned respect as a top assistant manager went down in a huge firey blaze. the night I was fired from work, I was considering suicide fortunately I called a friend for help. when I went to the Dr. the next day and told her what happened she refused to take me off the medication. so my mother and I told her off and I refused to take the stuff anymore. I was much better a week after I went off the med. I'd like to sue the makers of wellbutrin!!! Any side effects MAKE YOUR DOCTOR LISTEN!!!!

I was very anxious, irrational, agitated, had audio and visual hallucinations, irritable, hostile, impulsive and was severely fidgety.  This medication runs this risk, but as said, the benefits outweigh the side effects.  However, in a case like mine, this medication just is not an option for me.

After several months of trying it, my physician switched me to Zoloft, which worked better with my body chemistry. However, I do know of others who have been helped a great deal by Wellbutrin.

I have had side effects such as dry mouth which has been pretty severe.  I have also had an aweful taste in my mouth - like a metallic taste.  The dry mouth has been the most inconvenient because by the end of the day, I have little voice left.  I get canker sores on my tongue because of the dry mouth as well."

779$Condition: Depression$9/19/2007 7:21:03 AM$Reviewer: SweetLatina30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Wellbutrin gave me my life back. I had been seeing a therapist for months before I told my real doctor about my depression and he gave me a prescription. I just found myself more confused by therapy, but Wellbutrin allowed me to think clear again. I never needed therapy again. Just make sure you withdraw from it slowly. Itried to just stop and it was hard. When I slowly reduced the dose I was able to get off it okay. My sister took Paxil and stayed hooked on it. It also killed her sex drive and caused her divorce. Her husband cheated on her. I didn't have any problems like that with Wellbutrin and I lost 18 pounds! God bless the people who invented this stuff.
