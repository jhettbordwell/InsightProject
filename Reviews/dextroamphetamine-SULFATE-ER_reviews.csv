4$Condition: Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day$8/29/2016 12:55:08 PM$Reviewer: JJ, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$My doctor told me that I have OSA (Obstructed Sleep Apnea) and I already use a CPAP.  However, I was falling asleep at work and on way home and even on way to work while driving.  Since I've been using this drug for approx. 5 weeks, it has been wonderful!  I am not only staying awake at work and on the road, but I am able to do more at work and my focus is MUCH better in meetings and otherwise.  I couldn't be more happy, so far, I hope it doesn't cause any long-term issues.  And even better; on the weekends, I'm more active with my daughters.  This drug has fixed a problem I've had for a very long time.

14$Condition: Other$4/19/2013 5:21:15 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$I have very mild asperger's syndrome and have been taking Dextro for well over 12 years. I used to never be in control of my actions and I was always waaaaaaay to hyper to take anything serious. Now that I take it, I have become focused and able to achieve the goals that I have set for myself and get to college, something my doctor said I would never be able to do. The only downside that I have from Dextro is that it makes me somewhat introverted and it takes me a while to open up to people, but the side effect has slowly decreased. I would HIGHLY recommend this drug for those with asperger's and those with ADHD (similar to my asperger's symptoms.) The medicine is not expensive and it REALLY works.

  I have also been an addict since I was in my early teen's. Alcohol/weed/LSD/XtC/and on and on..... 
 I graduated into Harder drugs. Opiates Eg.Heroin, oxycontin,Morphine.
But stimulant drugs have been my #1 worst of all my addictions.I Have been a Hardcore cocaine/Crack addict now for 15years.
I was Diagnosed with ADD at the age of 8. I was put on many alternatives with no help until trying Ritalin. 
Ritalin (XR) helped with many symptoms and behaviour issues. But within two years  began to fail because of my tolerance. & again back to old behaviours.
 I lived in small town southern Ontario Growing up.Even though my family life was fairly normal with 2 sisters & both loving parents.  My life was a wreck. In and out of jail. I flopped out of school and into drugs. 
By 25 I was in Jail for two counts of robbery because of a crack addiction. 
 I ended up in North America's worst place for any person with drug addiction to Move to. 
Vancouver's notorious (DTES) Downtown East Side. 
The point to this is now I have been almost 3 years off Crack/coke.  And it's because that 3 years  ago I went on Dexedrine and was able to get my life back with therapy
and medication so for me it saved my life. It does have addictive properties but when on the right dose it can be very affective.After reaching a dose both My doctor and I were both comfortable with. As tolerance is concerned it has not become a problem.  I've been on the same dose for all that time.

I have ADD, tried adderall and the XR,the reg. Adderall caused unexplained anger/frustration type symptoms, mood swings,and only worked for about 4 hrs.  I then tried the Adderall XR and it worked well for about 6 months which is when  my Insurance didn't want to cover it anymore. With no Generic Adderall XR available at the time, I was started on the dexidrine XR. I have had no bad side effects so far(3years) and it works very well for me with the focus, concentration, and motivation issues associated with ADD. My 18yr old daughter that was diagnosed with ADHD about 4 years ago is on the dexadrine, and seems to have issues with misuse by taking more then prescribed(loses effictiveness/build a tolerance), and/or staying up for 2-3 days in a row, not eating, mood swings, etc. Similar experiences with older daughter(23) and son(21), both with ADD and had some similar issues, but with the Adderall. Parents, Please be well informed, educated, and attentive to your children and teens on stimulant medications. In the event that medication is absolutly nessesary for your minor child to be able to function, Please try alternatives that are not amphetamines first such as Stratera or Concerta. Just a suggestion from an experienced mom. "

From my school days til I was 55, when I started, my life was lousy, I was overweight, quick tempered, and blew through 2 marriages, messed up 4 kids who had it,also. My wife saw a program on ADHD, called me in to see it. That was me! I was tested, and tried all the popular drugs until I got Dextrostat. Wow, what a cheange! My wife could tell if I forgot my meds inanhour. I am trying to find a replacement, as Barr says they are having trouble with supplies. The whole shortage is due to the Adderall users getting dextrostst(Now a generic)and staying on it. I was given Adderall, and ended up with headaches and a spike in my BP, almost 190/90. I am experiencing some headaches and increase in BP, but cannot feel any addition withdrawal. I started out with 5 mg/day and have increased it in 3-4 year intervals to the 35 mg I take today. I can tell when it is not working well when I can't sleep. I refuse to take the popular sleep drugs, as the side effects scare me. Come on Barr labs, A/K/A Tela labs from Israel, get busy!

Have had to work a little to adjust dosage. This trial at 10 Mg Sustained Action capsules 4 times a day.  I am a Vietnam Era Veteran with a long history of indicated Rx medications combined with a natural high tolerance. I am also well educated and a responsible VA patient.  About 6 weeks into this regimen I realized I needed to talk with my prescriber. I was not realizing prescribed bioavailability. (Rx not working as MD intended.) A once a day 10 Mg tablet, not sustained release, prescribed as an intended balancing effort.  We found my comfort zone.  Now my diagnosed condition is treated and regular medical attention to monitor ongoing progress is documented. Perhaps as with any Rx I do have some issues, one of which gets me a confused look from my regular MD prescriber.  With the SA Caps I will sometimes not be able to take them at the same time every day. I have enough experience now to point definitively to this medication. Dextroamphetamine is a CNS stimulant and as such should elevate sensory functions.  The SA Caps are designed to have a lesser degree of quick release with a leveling off action.  I take them as prescribed and within 40 to 50 minutes I can hardly keep my eyes open.  My research shows a similar reaction young people experience with Ritalin.  It is ""Speed"", yet it calms the hyper child down.  I have no empirical evidence and have not found anyone who has like experiences. Perhaps this post will help.  This medication in no way diminishes my appetite or waistline. MD/patient discussion on this is in accord. While I do get therapeutic value, I am actually well below my own tolerance level.  The medication loses the battle big time at the fridge. I do experience expected though very unwanted side effects. Elevated but well monitored BP. Tenderness in male reproductive area. Mild systemic nerve parasthesia if I forget to dose and I do. No overwhelming desire to mow the lawn at 4 am. My grade for my diagnosis, 90. "

The only thing that I complained about with the Adderall XR was that I sometimes would get nervous and the fact that I smoked a lot more on the Adderall XR. She (my doctor) then asked about Vyvanse, but my parents insurance did not cover. So she then said that Extended Release Dexedrine was the way she wanted to go, to make it easier on my wallet. I find it is pretty much the same as the Adderall XR. I am able to focus, my mind doesn't wander into the blue, I can concentrate in all my classes at college, etc. I am not trying to tell everyone that is on Adderall XR to switch over to this, I just think it is a better treatment option for people that tend to get the nervousness and side effects of the Adderall. Two thumbs up from me!

This final additon alllowed me to focus, think clearly, and not let depresssion overwhelm me. It can be habit-forming (I have experienced it, withn some very unpleasant withdrawal when I ran out), but overall if taken as directed it is pretty amazing. I never had experienced amphetamines before and was surprised that I became calmer, focuses, productive, and proactive about my life. I use it as a maintenance drug now but plan on weaning off it when things calm down.

They say that my behavior is improved, and even I have noticed that my concentration is alot better. My insurance gave me generic amphetamine salts, in which EVERYTHING went bad, my concentration was poor, my grades went down, and my attitude was rotten, not to mention my appetite came back in full force (blast these ten pounds), so now I am back on the medication, and even after 4 hours being on it, I can see the difference. I also take an anti-biotic for my acne, and im not finding any effects of taking the two at the same time. Its a great medicine. My only complaint is a slight dependency, not to mention my train of thought tends to go into the gutter sometimes. Also, it seems as though I have started caring less about the opposite sex, but I think it may just be me.

Prior to that, I took Provigil [really liked it, but it is no longer available on my pharmcy formulary], Ritalin [hated the side effects-mostly shakiness and it didn't seem to work well].  When I first started taking it, the results were great! No bad side effects, either.  The loss of appetite is NOT a negative one for me :).  Howwever, the past 6 months or so, I've found I can wake in the morning, eat breakfast and take my meds - then, fall sound asleep for another few hours - unless I somehow force myself to get up and stay up.  My job was ""down-sized"" about 8 months ago, so most days I don't HAVE to get up at any particular time.  I went so far as to check my pills to be sure somehow I wasn't getting a placebo.  As far as I can tell.. and, from what my doctor and the pharmacy tells me - I am taking the same drug and same strength.  They are baffled... I'm really concerned about this.  There are time periods of up to a week that I've taken a break from the drug without any problems stopping or re-starting it.  I wonder if anyone else has had anything similar going on.  Since this isn't an interactive forum, just a ""yes"" or ""no"" vote will, at least let me know if I'm not the only one having this problem..."

I originally tried Ritalin, but eventually the strongest dose was not enough. Have been on Dexedrine for about 15 years and even though it has become ineffective by about 90%, there is nothing that can replace it. Our government saw fit to remove Biphetamine from the market, so this is all that is left. Tried the new type of drugs, Provigil etc.  but they were totally ineffective. This is a good drug if you can keep yourself from developing a tolerance to it by taking a break from it, but with Narcolepsy, you can't really afford to do that.

I am now in college and it helps me to focus in on whatever the professor is teaching like when you zoom in with binoculars or something. Bad thing is I worry it could be addictive especially if a person is predisposed to addiction which I am. Sometimes this seems to give me an insatiable appetite which I think is due to the fact that amphetamines make your body use up its glucose faster which is energy for your cells I believe. But if you have been suffering with add this has been the number 1 best medication I have used for it and I tried concerta, adderal, ritalin transdermal patches, and vyvanse.

79$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/5/2008 4:21:30 AM$Reviewer: mike,  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"With Dexedrine, I am taking a med I self-medicated in the '60s! In 9th grade in '62, I could not stay awake in the AM. My Mom's best friend was a drug salesman and she got Dexamyl for weight. I snitched a few dex 15 mg spansule there and at my corner drugstore job. From teacher and parents, I got the usual ""lazy, no motivation"". Scorn from father who laughed that I would be lawyer. But on Dex, I was honorable mention Merit Scholar.  In college, I remembered ""speed"" and took it to study, carrying virtually an ""A"" average--I was admitted to and graduated a top 10 law school in 1973.I did not take it in Law School, for fear of getting caught and not wanting to use a crutch. My grades were unremarkable. For the next 30 years, I struggled through terrible life events, witn no medication for my horrific AD/HD. During my second divorce,2002, my X demanded I be tested and I was. I got meds and the Dex is like putting eyeglasses on my brain. I take 15 mg 4 times a day--not out of the usual range--I am 200 pound athletic type. I also take bupoprion aka Wellbutrin for my HD--150 SR twice daily. both work just great for me, since 2002. I tried ritalin, and the other one--I forget its name--but they were ineffective. I have not tried the new ones and do not plan to do so.I am extremely happy with Dexedrine, having taken it on and off for nigh 45 years--and totally on for the last 6 years.
I get cotton mouth occasionally, or a bad taste. But my side effects are nothing, zero, compared to the benefits. You folks should try the drugs available--don't be shy, since dosage for a person is trial and error for both stimulants and anti depressives. We AD/HD victims are actually a hell of a lot smarter than the Lilliputians insulting us through life. I love the look on their faces when I tell them my legal career has been in DC as counsel to the Senate, House and the White House and various Federal agencies. You will be amazed at what you can do when you can count on yourself--awake!"

My family and teachers thought my failures in school were because I was lazy.

School was hard for me.  I would get bored because nothing made any sense, I could try with every fiber of my being to pay attention and understand what my teachers told me (sometimes only out of respect of my friends around me trying to listen and work) but I just couldn't do it!  

I remember often telling myself 'okay, this is the day that it's all going to make sense, and you're gonna get it' but much to my disappointment I'd find myself totally confused and embarassed to ask questions, mostly because I didn't even always know which part I was confused about!

This happened with all subjects too!  I could be VERY interested and engaged in the class and would still walk away learning only a fraction of what my peers did!  I thought I was mentally retarded and worked very hard at seeming smarter than I really was so that people/teachers wouldn't learn my 'secret' and send me to 'special', now I sometimes they had!

I ended up dropping out and getting my GED.
And it wasn't until I went to college and started having the same old troubles again, only this time I was paying for my classes and wasn't ABOUT to flake them off!  I tried everything.  I'd read material over and over and still not understand.  It wasn't until a professor recommended I see my doctor about the having adult ADD.

I explained my problem and told my Dr if it wasn't this I was 'slow' and requested testing.  He found me cognitively sound and agreed w/the possibility of ADD and sent me to be evaluated by a psychologist, who indeed diagnosed me w/ADD.

I'm 29,and I've been taking the med now for five years and have since graduated college and work doing Medical Billing.  A job that requires constant focus and is based on productivity.  

I've done my homework, and I honestly believe that I would not be able to do the work I love doing w/o Dexidrine!"

I would have to read a paragraph 10 times to get the same information that an average person got with only reading it one time.

Took a couple of day to adjust to it, but had my parents not been so #[email protected]%^&+ ignorant, I may have had a better chance in my earlier years to have been more focused and believe more in myself. Now at 36, I have a family and am trying to put myself through nursing school.. Not an easy task, but the medication for my slow brain function is a miracle, it has improved my focus, my memory, the visualization of project completion rather than the overwhelming feeling of it.
