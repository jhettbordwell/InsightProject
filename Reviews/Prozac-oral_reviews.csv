He explained the benefits of prozac. It took me a month to see the positive results. I am so glad I did. I feel wonderful. No more anxiety/panic attacks.

On the good side, i was neutral emotionally. On the bad side I got pssd and also rage symptoms (that i never had) that may remain or may not for the rest of my life.
2$Condition: Depression$12/8/2018 3:36:15 PM$Reviewer: Pdee, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$3$3$I have been taking this daily for 19 years. I do not like taking it or the stigma attached. But if I do not take this there is a rapid decline into my behaviour before starting it. Paranoia, ocd and massive depression returns. Tried to reduce dose to come off it, I can't ever according to doctor. I believe taking this has saved me, without it I would be dead. 
3$Condition: Depression$8/28/2018 4:17:48 AM$Reviewer: StaySafe, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month$1$1$1$I see from reviews here a lot of people had good results, I am not one of those people.. Everyone reacts differently..  I took one pill a long time ago and I actually had side-effects that lasted for 10 years. It gave me panic attacks and the taste of burning plastic in my mouth... My first day on Prozac I ended up calling 911, cause I thought I was having a heart attack, but it ended up being my first panic attack along with the taste of burning plastic in my mouth and strange thoughts (disturbing thoughts).. After that ordeal I ended up throwing away that bottle of Prozac.. I find it strange they wont list all the side-effects on this page.. They ask you to talk to your doctor about additional side-effects.. Thats crazy.. I recall the side-effects list being a lot longer back in the day.. And they aren't pretty.. I highly recommend keeping a close eye on a family member that is taking this medication and make sure to ask them if they are having strange thoughts.. You just dont know what someone is capable on this medication.. It can be very dangerous if someone has as severe reaction as myself.. I originaly requested a perscription of prozac from my doctor due to depression from my business going Bankrupt.. I regret ever taking this drug.. I will never take another prescription drug ever again.. So make sure to monitor your loved ones if they must take this drug, cause anything is possible..

5$Condition: Depression$5/21/2017 1:14:30 PM$Reviewer: KR, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$3$Side effects outweighed the benefits for me. Terrible night sweats (soaking the sheets!) and jaw clenching, but the kicker was the irrational bruising. If I so much as knicked my shin on anything I'd bruise like a peach and healing time was 3x longer than usual for any cuts etc. 
6$Condition: Depression$5/9/2017 2:11:15 PM$Reviewer: BeMaRe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was previously on Paxil, which was ok. After 5 years, it wore off. I switched to Prozac, and the 'foginess' is gone. My mind is clear. I stopped over eating. I've stopped napping. I had no side effects. For me, this works.

Saved my life, honestly. 80 mg a day. I'm a college student so this helps me keep up with the hectic pace of the ten week quarter system as well as the tragedies that occur in life.
9$Condition: Depression$12/29/2016 12:45:10 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$3$On it for just over a month. It did away with my suicidal thoughts and overall improved my mood but the side effects were too much for me. It caused me to be almost constantly drowsy and unable to focus as I had no energy and was often on the verge of falling asleep. I would constantly pass out midday for an hour or so at a time, and then would struggle to stay asleep at night. I would wake up in the middle of night and had more intense nightmares. These were all daily occurrences. I also experienced dizziness and lightheadedness every few days. Sometimes I'm not sure if Prozac actually helped my mood, or if it just made me too tired to feel anything. I felt fine emotionally but had no motivation to do anything but sleep the entire day.

Unfortunately after a month, not only no improvement, but feeling worse than ever.  Doctor is starting me on Lexapro.  I'm really disappointed that it did not help me.  The side effects were not terrible, the worse thing is that is upsets your stomach, but I did not have the ""fogginess"" and brain zaps that I experienced with Zoloft. "

The one I took for years had become ineffective.  Prozac gave a definite lift but the side effects were too hard to live with: weight gain (which is not helping my sleep apnea), and excessive loose bowels (difficult to plan anything away from the house), followed by constipation.  One to the next drug which was even worse.

It helped a little while (2 months) but then It quit working and got way worse. I had suicidal thoughts and just ""didn't care"" about anything anymore. I also had horrible insomnia while taking this and could only sleep with Ambien. After I stopped the Prozac, I was addicted to Ambien. But that's for another review. Try another drug for mild depression first."

Albeit the depression greatly improved it did not help with the weight gain, and this one is one of the few anti-depressants that claim ""may cause weight loss"".  I could not be so lucky.  I've gained 20 lbs in a year.  Since my depression has greatly improved my doctor is weening me off.  Hopefully I will lose this weight.  But overall, I have to rate it as GREAT because it has helped with my depression and that after all is why it was prescribed."

29$Condition: Depression$1/22/2015 12:03:59 PM$Reviewer: TigerShan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more$5$5$5$I have been taking Prozac since about 1995 for depression.  We (my doctor and I) have experimented with other medications, but this is the only one that is effective for me.  We have tried modifying the dosage to up it to 60 mg.  At first the brain fog lifted and I felt wonderful...but after a week or so, my body adjusted and the fog was back.  We then tried going the other direction, lowering the dosage to the minimum  effective dosage. Now I take 10 mg a day and have for the last four or five years.  I take it in the morning so I can get through a day of work without arguing with anyone.  The dosage could probably be a touch higher so I didn't argue with family at night, but I am happy to keep my job at this point.  Prozac has made that possible and I highly recommend it at a very low dose.  It doesn't take much to effect your chemical imbalances.

I ended up tying my hands together with bondage cuffs to prevent swinging my arms around during the night.
32$Condition: Depression$1/16/2015 2:52:55 AM$Reviewer: Megan, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$2$5$I started on Prozac when I was ten and have continued using it for 6 years. The dose was increased when my therapist discovered I was still self harming and since then I've had a lot of memory loss, abnormal sweating, dizziness, and a few times in school my legs have given out. Two weeks ago I overdosed on ibuprofen in an attempt to take my life and was in a mental hospital. The increased suicidal thoughts and other side effects only appeared when my dose went from 20 to 40 milligrams. I've also had a huge decrease in appetite and lost almost 20 lbs by now. I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow for the first time since I got out of the hospital and I'm going to ask her about my dosage and if any changes could be made to it. My ocd and anxiety issues have probably increased since I started taking it. It does help with depression and lack of motivation, but honestly, I'm not really sure if it's worth it.
33$Condition: Depression$1/6/2015 4:26:12 PM$Reviewer: Sweetdeja, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I have been on Prozac for about 6 weeks and have had many of the side affects like nausea, headaches, backache,itching all over. weight loss, diarrehea, loss of libido, sleeplessness, tiredness, restless. legs and my dr still wants me to stay on the medication for a little longer.  I feel very little relief from depression/anxiety. I also take trazadone to sleep every night and Ativan for anxiety.  I tried Prozac 25 years ago and it worked great for about a year until I had a family tragedy and had to be put on Wellbrutrin which worked for over 10 years.  Then my new dr added lamictal, cymbalta and abilify which worked very well until my insurance changed and I could no longer afford the cymbalta or abilify.  I was put on Zoloft, Effexor that did not help at all. That is when the Prozac was added.  I have not felt like myself since.  I want to stay in the house and in bed all day and night, can't eat due to nausea, have lost 25 pounds (which I don't mind). I have asked my dr to give me something else on several occasions only to have to say yo give it more time. I am going into treatment in a week and will have another psychiatrist work with me and my meds and maybe we can work this out.  I am not saying Prozac is bad, it just doesn't work for everyone. If your dr doesn't work with you get a second opinion. This disease is nothing to play with.
34$Condition: Depression$9/25/2014 10:39:29 PM$Reviewer: lea, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$"Prozac has worked very well for me, and I've been on it since 1996 when I was diagnosed with clinical depression.  Not wanting to take RX in general, I've tried with my Dr's help to stop taking it 3 times over the years.  Each time, in a few months, I'd notice profound depressive symptoms returning with a vengeance, so I've stayed on it.  In the first year, we altered the dosage to get it right, and I've cut back once (didn't work) and upped the dosage once (weird side effects.) So now I'm at 40 mg on which I feel ""normal"" with minimal depressive episodes.  On doctor's suggestion I tried adding Wellbutrin to see if my libido would return, and it did.....BUT, after a few weeks Wellbutrin stopped helping my libido at all, so I just stayed with Prozac alone.  Though I have concerns about staying on it this long, I don't function well at all without it, AND it works so well, I feel so well, that I plan to keep taking it.  Healthy diet (gluten-free) has also helped with the overall effectiveness of Prozac for me.   "

I am also very sensitive to medicines. After two days of taking Prozac (20mg) I could immediately notice a change, along with terrible side effects. The positive things I noticed was I did not have these re-occurring thoughts as often as I usually do. I would wake up feeling ""okay"". Those are both two huge things that made me very happy about taking this drug...but the side effects were just not worth it for me. The worst side effect I faced was LOW SEX DRIVE. Actually, there was no sex drive. Not even a feeling ""down there"". It sucked. I felt my stomach tighten up after I took the pill and for the whole day I was nauseous and tired. Surely the nausea was something I could push through but the no sex drive was not a fair toss up...just gonna have to keep looking for the right drug. "

I have been told I had TMD in the last 10 years give or take. I am now 54 and have TMD so bad that I can only eat soft food. I have constant shooting pain through my left ear. I go for PT, use warm and cold compresses and wear a splint. I have significant weight loss due to pain and not eating. I went to see specialists for head and face pain.  I was just informed by a rather new psychiatrist that Prozac can cause bruxism. I do believe that Prozac is the cause of my joint damage. I have worn my teeth down and have had to have crowns replaced. I have a hard time eating beacause I have worn my chewing teeth down to nothing, This may sound petty but every night I cry because the pain is so severe. I don't know what to do. I don't want anyone else to suffer like I am. It even hurts to talk. Please make people aware that this side effect may happen.
45$Condition: Depression$5/1/2014 8:04:30 PM$Reviewer: DrDo001, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$4$"Seemed to help somewhat initially. Have felt my total apathetic approach and response to life was perhaps linked to Prozac @ 60mg. per day in AM for over a year now. No energy nor interest in anything, good or bad! Do not want to socialize, communicate with anyone. No interest in previous hobbies, passions, career, projects, friends, travel, etc. Could just stay in bed all day every day. Accomplish only simple daily activities at home. Feel like brain is in a fog, fuzzy thinking, disorganized, distracted. Believe this is a result of the drug and its effects. Asked mental health nurse to consider changing the Rx. She wanted to increase dosage even higher, and I refused. My rationale for causation from Prozac as follows: Since it ended my road rage, only logical that it would also end energy level, interest level in life, avoidance of humans, shopping, exercising, reading, gardening. Do not believe it has improved depression at all.    

After reading these reviews of negative side effects of Prozac, I am convinced I have been accurate that behaviors have been intensified by the drug. I will change physicians, and do not think the current situation is a result of ADHD, as proposed by health care professional."

So my current doctor gave me prozac which acts differently than Wellbutrin. I've been seeing family and friends more often, which helps, but even they have noticed an obvious mood lift. I'm going through huge, sad life changes right now but despite that, my depression is lifting. I can't fall asleep easily without the TV on, but am attributing this more to the fact that I start thinking about all of my problems when I try to sleep, instead of relaxing. The TV allows me to relax and fall asleep. So am thinking that the prozac is not the causing me to not fall asleep quickly like I used to.

I never got help for it even after attempting suicide and being harmful to myself. The next two years were okay, my depression and such came in spurts and never as bad as before. I decided to get myself of medication just to see if I could hopefully feel better or somehow cure my illness. Doctor told me take fluoxetine once every night but the next day when I picked up my bottle it said ""once every other night"" and I assumed that's what I should do. Well it caused my depression to extremely spike up, no motivation what so ever, sleepy during the day but dealt with insomnia at night, grades to fall, panic attacks, everything you could ever imagine your lowest point would be. All this happened in the span of a month. Went back to the doctor, told him everything, and he lowered my dosage and told me to take it in the morning. Well, after 3 weeks nothing is happening, things are getting worse, and I feel as if I have no control anymore. I took myself off of it and I've been off it for about a month and it still feelings like I haven't stopped taking it except now I'm suicidal and dealing with psychotic thoughts.

It was very ineffective! However, when combined with Lamictal, it greatly improved my condition, so for that reason I will say it works.

My depression isn't completely gone (therapy is the other half of the treatment), but it helps me simply get out of bed and be able to do anything.

The way I take it is tedious because I'm on a wonky dosage, at 50 mg. I have to take it in 5 10 mg pills, which is unfortunate. If you're on a regular dose like 40 mg, it's a breeze to take (just one pill)."

The best part about it: while taking the drug, I am a ""better"" version of myself.  Things that happen to me when I'm not taking the drug will send me into a spiral downward; on the drug, I deal with those little setbacks like everyone else does (I believe) - the events might bother me, but I can let them go.  Downside of the drug:  Although it doesn't take away all my sexual desire, it makes it REALLY hard to have an orgasm.

Several times over the past 15 years I thought I was ""cured"" of my depression so I stopped taking the Prozac.  Like clockwork, within 5 weeks I'd be crying in a public bathroom somewhere over something silly or angry at everyone, everywhere.  For whatever reason, this stuff works great for me."

I had been living this life since I was only 8 years old.  Last week, I was talking to my girlfriend about how miserable I was.  My sex drive was going away.  I couldn't even look her in the eyes because of my lack of confidence.  I literally was a walking, ticking time bomb full of anger.  I would wake up in the morning and not even want to shower.  My girlfriend is on prozac and we were sitting in her car and she said, ""here take a pill"" jokingly.  I said, ""let me try it.""  ""It can't hurt.""  THAT VERY SAME DAY, I started to feel normal.  The first thing that I noticed was that my anger was hugely diminished.  I noticed that my worrying was far less too.  One week later, I can honestly say that I feel so much better.  I can now see a light at the end of the tunnel.  I can actually feel feelings again other than anger.  I don't feel manic.  I feel normal again and I thank God for this medicine.

If you don't feel like yourself on a medication then it's not a good sign.

I'm def willing to find something else when I go back to see my PCP on Monday, trial and error.
What works for one person may not work for another. But I'm still hopeful that it will work"

155$Condition: Depression$4/11/2012 1:16:49 PM$Reviewer: TeeLady, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have used this med for over 20 years. I was at a point of being suicidal at the time but I recommend counseling along with any antidepressnt drug if your situation is serious.  Mine was. I was so depressed for so long that it was hard for my body to let go and be less depressed, but after a few weeks along with conseling I realized I was beginning to do better. Over the years, circumstances got better, so I began taking 10 mg every other day because its half life is longer than most of the other meds.  I now take none and am maintaining pretty good at present because life circumstances got better.  I've looked at other antidepressants but I will probably use Prozac again should I need it. I still suggest seeing a pshycologist or pshychiatrist for evaluation before starting any antidepressant.  Depression is caused by a lot of different things and one pill by itself may not fix the problem. You must peel the layers off of depression like the layers of an onion to heal. Good luck.

I wouldn´t wish this stuff on my worst enemy.  At first it made me feel good but that didn´t last after about four years I was nervous all the time, witdrawn and began to have severe anxiety.  I have tried to stop many times but am so adicted to the drug that I have to take some form of S.S.R.I.  Prozac completely ruined my life.  I use to be able to function.  I use to have confidence in myself and be fairly normal.  Now I question everything.  My advice is don´t touch this stuff.  It is psychologically addictive and physically addictive and if you ever decide you want to get off it can be too late as it has made your anxiety go through the roof, your depression worsen, and you are now completely physically addicted.  Taking drugs to cope with life is not natural and just because a doctor perscribes it and they say it is meant to treat a certain condition doesn´t mean you are not taking a drug and falling into the escapism and perils of taking any other drug.  Once cocaine was considered the miracle drug until it became clear what it did to people.  I think Doctors who perscribe anti depressants are incompetant and I think the pharmaseutical industry is a billion dollar industry focused on making billions no matter what the human cost.  I hate Prozac and know that is is very bad news.  Don´t even think of taking anti depressants.

Every time I noticed a correlation between the depression and anxiety and the changing seasons and also noticed the symptoms started the day of ovulation and ceased the day menstruation began. These are concerns I discussed with my doctor and each time I was ignored and these ""coincidences"" were brushed off. Each time I was diagnosed I was given a prescription for an anti depressant without discussion of alternatives. On my most recent visit two months ago I was prescribed Prozac and took it out of desperation for about a month and a half with no results. I was still having horrible premenstrual depression. After doing research on PMS and depression I realized my symptoms may be due to low progesterone levels. After reading a few books I started using natural progesterone cream from the day of ovulation until menses and got relief from my symptoms immediately. If you are a woman who suffers from depression PLEASE do yourself a favor and read books by Dr. John Lee, including ""Hormone Balance Made Simple"", & ""What Your Dr. May Not Tell You About Premenopause"". It will change your life and help you return to your natural happy self. I also suggest reading into alternative treatments for depression such as 5HTP & Sam-e, which are two supplements that are as effective if not more so than pharmaceutical anti depressant medication. Please read WebMD reviews on 5HTP from the link below, it will give those of you with mild to severe depression hope http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredi entreview-794-5-HTP.aspx?drugid=794&drugname= 5-HTP&pageIndex=8&sortby=3&conditionF ilter=-500"

With all I had side effects. I am very sensitive to medications. On prozac just under a month. I have only had the side effect of tiredness.Do not judge a medication or read to much into others. You are likely to have things happen because you read about it. The mind is our most powerful tool. Remembering even Asprin has side effects. I am on 20mg a day in the am, and Xanax .25mg 2 X a day. This is good for me. I know many who have had success with some of the drugs I couldn't use. Don't give up you will find the one too. Also there are some people who will bash a medication 50+ times, as someone has done for Prozac. One more thing I find no difference from brand to generic, possible another mind issue for others.

I still feel sad a lot, I still have suicidal thoughts (no intentions though), and I still suffer from my generalized anxiety disorder. But on a scale of 1-10 10 being the worst, I was a 10. This has brought it down to a 6. I took Prozac before and it didn't seem to do much so then I switched to Effexor 75mg per day, then I switched to 50mg of Zoloft, then I went to a combo of 20mg of Lexapro and 150mg of Wellbutrin. I wanted to try Prozac again and instead of starting at 10mg for the first week then going to 20, I started at 20 and went to 40. Effexor, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin were prescribed from a psychiatrist as well was the first run with Prozac. So after 2 months being off the Lexapro and Wellbutrin combo, I talked to my regular doctor and she gladly prescribed Prozac and just increased the dose. It's ridiculous how the psychiatrist had my brain switching from med to med when all I needed was a simple increase in my Prozac. And another thing, you hear so much negative, but there is positive to Prozac. For some it can destroy a family, and for others it may rebuild one.

190$Condition: Depression$11/23/2011 1:26:39 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$"This medication has been life-changing for me. I am currently taking 40mg. It was prescribed for my anxiety, depression, and obsessive thoughts. It took me awhile to figure out that I needed to take the Brand name because I got bad side effects/less effective when I switched to Generic, but now I've been back on the brand name and its a dramatic difference. My depression is so much better and I feel like a cloud has lifted. Everything is pretty much better, but I still have my ups and downs. No pill is a ""miracle."" I may need to up my dose when I see my psychiatrist next week because I've recently been having a more difficult time coping w/my life. However, overall, this med is a great choice for me. Only side effects: stomach discomfort/indigestion intermittently, and hyperactivity (but that is much preferred to my anxiety & depression). Thank you Prozac! I do believe antidepressants are overprescribed, but for me it is a necessity. I've learned the hard way that I decompensate without an antidepressant. Prozac is the one that has really worked for me. Oh, and in case you are wondering, it actually has NOT badly impacted my sex drive! I am still very much active w/my fiance;) So SSRIs don't always have a bad effect on your libido. Give it a try! It may work for you!"

212$Condition: Depression$8/5/2011 12:28:29 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"First, I would like to say that it is crucial to find the right medicine for you by working with a doctor you trust. Prozac works for me, but may not work for you. Don't give up, and most importantly, don't wait to get help. Make an appointment as soon as you have questions or concerns about your mind and/or body.

For me, personally, Prozac has been great. I suffered from depression during most of my twenties, but was resistant to taking medicine. I was worried about side effects. I tried Zoloft, which did not work for me - made me jittery (which might have been the dosage, or just the med). I've also taken ADD meds for ADD and had symptoms of paranoia with the two that I tried on separate occasions. I find that the Prozac helps a little with ADD. I've come to just accept my ADD also - I felt like a different person when I was medicated for it.

Prozac has helped my depression significantly. I don't have major side effects. I have had weight gain, but I don't know if I can blame the medicine. It is harder to achieve an orgasm (I'm a woman) but I can still get there. The sexual side effects have been frustrating sometimes, but I wouldn't trade the feelings of well being I have when I take my 20 mg day as prescribed(I went off of it once cold turkey and the depression came back).

Again, hang in there, best wishes, and find a doctor who listens to you and is knowledgeable in their field.

Effectiveness has been good, I do not bear the same depressive mood swings I had become accustomed to. My reasons for the 3 star Satisfaction rating are: 1)I do not get enough sleep. Was resting 8 hours per day, now lucky to get 4. And 2) I find myself clammy and sometimes even sweaty in normal temperatures and overall conditions.

When my son was born he suffered from seizures, frequent (unexplained) crying episodes & has respiratory issues. I discovered 2-3 yrs later that it was NOT recommended to use during pregnancy & that what my son experienced was withdrawal symptoms. It only worked for a period of just over a year & then I developed side effects of increased irritability & it was not longer effective at treating my depression. If I could go back & try something else, I would. I am now on something different that works much better.

If you are planning on having a baby, I would NOT recommend this anti-depressant if it can be helped. (depression, especially during/afer pregnancy is not to be ignored & can be extremely serious .. in some cases, the benefits outweigh the risks, so the decision of which medication to take can only be decided by you & your dr)"

What a relief...

After about 3 weeks I really noticed a difference and I really liked the results. I didn't care about what anyone thought of me. I lost my appetite but I was still healthy. Before I hated talking to people and I had suicidal thoughts. My mom took me off them right away because she thought I was ""addicted"" (the pills weren't magically disappearing.) now I have extreme head aches and dizzyness. So careful when you stop! Cut your pill in half and start decreasing slowly"

In conjunction with weekly therapy, Prozac has made such a difference in my life. I am very sensitive to new medications, and did not experience the typical rough transition the first few weeks. The only side effects I can complain about are frequent nightmares and an increased appetite, but I will gladly deal with those for the peace of mind I've finally achieved.
364$Condition: Depression$5/20/2010 3:54:28 PM$Reviewer: Marybelle23, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I took Prozac (Fluoxetine) for Depression/Bipolar and bulimia for 2 years. At first it worked like a miracle. It was like I drove out of a hurricane into a clear, beautiful day and all I could see in my rearview mirror was a storm I never wanted to go back to. Had a strong craving for sweets, I practically only ate Twizzlers, and lost a significant amount of weight. I had no more racing thoughts, I was reasonable and clear-headed, etc. But after about a year and a half, the honeymoon ended and I guess my body got used to it and all of a sudden all of my old symptoms came back, EXCEPT for my binge eating. If Prozac did one thing it stopped my Bulimia altogether. Prozac was great for me, while it lasted.

I was living in an extremely abusive environment with my mom and i honestly believe that if it hadn't been for this medication, I would have given up on life. The good thing is this medicine made me not be able to really ""feel"" my emotions. This was great for when I was sad. People could yell at me and it wouldnt even phase me. On the other hand it also 'numbed' out the good in life so I could never really ENJOY a fun/great moment. It was almost like I was a robot. It also messes with your sex life. It makes it very difficult to get in the mood. This medicine has been around a long time so all the side effects are known which was great. If I had to take this again, I would."

now I'm going for a 4th time.  The drugs helps me quite a bit, but the side effects become the next problem.  It takes about 6 weeks to work and I need to go up to 40mgs. As you feel better you focus on the negative effects of the drug.  The better mood you take for granted.  For me the sexual side effect cause me great fustration and then I just can't sleep.  This time around I'm gong to take just 20mgs with remeron and see how that goes. Oh, and don't give up on God.  Be well.  "

Went thru 1 yr. w/ a terrible Dr. I was completely disabled. Most days I could only lay in bed and sob uncontrolably. I slept about 16 hrs a day. Felt worthless, guilty, hopeless. Thought about suicide alot. Cut myself frequently. Had social anxiety. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Had trouble making even the smallest decisions. Got confused easily. Had anxiety for no reason. Didn't bathe, brush my teeth, or get dressed every day. Stopped going food shopping, did nothing. Had to force myself to do even the smallest tasks. Lost my job over all this. Finally, my husband made me go to a new Dr. and she put me on Prozac. It took about 6 to 8 wks to work for me. Once it did I started feeling better. Eventually I got up to 80mg per day. Then I felt like I was at about 80%, which was great compared to the way I had felt. Had to go off the prozac b/c my husband wanted a baby. I'm in my 7th month now n I'm kind of ok. I'm coping. Can't wait to get back on the prozac though.

Isn't helping the depression or anxiety plus I'm laughing hysterically one min. and very angry the next for no reason.  Anger isn't my normal personality.  My whole body feels strange like it's somewhere else & my head & face feel like slight electrical charges with a swishing sound, which is driving me crazy.  I've been on Zoloft, Paxil, strattera, buspirone & visteral, none have worked & most made me feel worse, not to mention soooooo tired all the time.  Can't they come up with something that actually works right?  Oh yeah, can't seem to stop eating either & I'm already way overweight, not good for my health, that's for sure.

Started Prozac - 8 days of 20 mg was all I could take. I felt like I had horrible jetlag 24/7!  I'm now 2 weeks off it and still feel horrible - my sleep patterns are terrible. I wake up sometimes at 3am and can't fall back asleep but I'm too tired to get up.  I'm tired all the time it seems, which is odd because this is the best shape I've been in for years (I go to the gym 5 times a week and love it - except for not going recently because of prozac).  So I hate this drug with a passion. It's been horrible and I just pray these side effects stop soon!

429$Condition: Depression$2/19/2010 11:56:40 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$This medication takes at least a month to take full effect. The first week I would wake up with nausea during the night. By the second week, I felt numb to most emotions. Both of these symptoms suck, but they go away. Without this medication, I don't think I would be able to function. It really worked for me while I was on it for about 7 months, I came off of it for a couple months, and the depression and anxiety came back, so I'm going back on it. The medication alone will most likely not cure anything, as I have learned, but combined with counseling, I'm hoping to heal myself.

When on the 40mg Prozac, combined with the others, I was unable to do much and stare at a Monitor. Xanax and Prozac cancelled the Dexedrine (even at 15mg ER). I am currently taking generic Prozac 20mg (one daily), generic Dexedrine 10mg ER (3x daily), and generic Xanax (No more than 1.25 mg 2-3x daily)and it has made a WORLD of diffrence. I am focused, anxiety well under control, barely notice Prozac, and the Dexedrine is for ADHD, and also fits this mix well at the 10mg ER dose rather than the 15mg dose. I feel alive, aware, normal, active and can focus. Be careful about taking ANY of these in high doses! I plan on weaning to lower dosage on all 3 within 2 months. My aim is to be chemical free sometime next year, or the BARE MINIMUM of what I need. I managed 45 years without Prozac or Dex, and have moved up the ranks in almost all jobs I had. The brain adapts, and should not be a chem lab for psychiatrists! Raed adverse reactions or discuss with your doctor before taking ONE Prozac! Hope this helps."

Prozac , zoloft, celexa, cymbalta, etc. doesnt work for me. Prozac AND Abilify together have been wonderful! Take my advice and dont quit using Prozac...just ask your doctor to prescribe Abilify to take along with it!

I felt so bad that I felt like I was literally going to loose my mind.  Saw the Dr. and he prescribed Prozac in conjunction with Xanax for sleep and the panic attacks.  After a couple of days, I no longer needed the Xanax; the Prozac put me back in a mood I could handle.  It may not work for everyone but I do highly recommend it!

My doctor upped it to 40, but still no effect.  I still have depression and ptsd pretty bad.  I hope to go off this medication and try celexa or pristiq asap with my doctor's approval.  This medication was good in that it also did not make me tired as others had and it reduced my appetite enough that I lost 15 lbs which was good for me.  I can't say I had any bad effects, I just don't feel it is helping anymore.

Sleeping, has been a big issue too, not sleeping too well, but I am not feeling tired during the day.   I am hoping these side effects will pass.

I stopped eating for comfort and felt confident.  I did notice side effects, loss of sex drive, jitters, sleepiness.  The longer I took it the more normal I felt.  My sex drive did return, the weight did not.  I do notice that my response to alcohol has changed since taking prozac.  I blackout from drinking very easily and feel worse mentally after drinking.  The doctor said that is common because prozac and alcohol work against each other.  Prozac is the best drug I have ever taken.  My dose was increased to 40mg this summer.  I haven't noticed a big difference but still feel great.

I take 20mg every other day. It has worked but I have not felt like my formal self since I got ill. It has made it so I can function and have some good times. So what I'm saying is it is not a cure all for me but I don't know what I would do without it. ONE QUESTION. It I take the brand name I'm ok. But the generic's don't seem to work for me or thats the way I see it. One generic by a certain manufacturer seems to work fairly well but I get mixed up if it is working or not. Of course the prices between the main brand and generic's is quite a bit. Has anyone else had this problem?? Thanks.

It helped to level my mood and lesson anxiety as well which was a nice bonus.  There were two side effects that bothered me however.  One was a racing heart, the other was more sexual related.  Either way, I'd like to find a med with the positive attributes without the side effects.

I was curled up in a ball in my house and couldn't move. It worked for a good few years and then it didn't. Just stopped. I also noticed then that I was having the ""shock"" sensations. Then when I 1st tried to get off of it, the shock sensations really increased. It took several attempts and about a year to ween off of it. The shocks lasted for several years after that. I have been diagnosed with ""essential trmors"" and I am convinced that the years of Paxil use caused it. I say if you do take this drug to only take it short term.  "

I stopped crying 24/7,& realized how I had abandoned housekeeping & personal hygeine totally. If I'm I miss taking my Prozac on schedule and under under severe stress, I still have some suicidal thougts, but NO actual plans or preparations for suicide, which I've done with other medications. The important thing for me is to remember to take the Prozac in the morning because it does lift my mood & if I take it at night, I don't sleep at all. You must NOT exceed your doctor's prescribed dosage or instructions for any reason. Make a chart or use a calendar & mark off each day after, not before, you take your Prozac. Don't be shy about telling your doctor everything you feel or think while you're taking Prozac. He can't regulate your dosage properly or know if it's the right medication for you, or if you need tests...if you don't give him the full facts and the truth. Besides Prozac, find someone, anyone, to tell your problems to. Don't hide from the world and think things will magically get better. They won't. Been there, tried that. Good luck to you. Spot

When I first started taking Prozac and had fantastic results --- depression symptoms decreased, no more suicidal thoughts, could actually get out of bed.  I started out at 20 mg and my doctor eventually increased my dosage to 40 mg.  This dosage worked fine for about two years.  Then I started to have signficant worsening of my depression symptoms.  The doctor then added Elavil in addition to Prozac.  Also tried Pamelor with the Prozac - both worked very well, but fatigue was extreme (and side effects were horrible). I don't mind mild side effects if it means the depression is gone.  I tried Remeron, Wellbutrin, and Celexa before returning to Prozac.  None of these worked as well as Prozac had initially.  I went back to 40 mg Prozac and did well.  My dosage was eventually decreased to 20 mg which I have been on for about 8 years.  My depression symptoms have been well-controlled with this ""maintenance dose"".  I have been having more symptoms the past few months.  My doctor wants me to try Pristiq (which I will start tomorrow).  Overall, Prozac worked wonders when is was working.  I definitely developed a tolerance to this medication over time.  Side effects were pretty mild.  I definitely sweat more than most people and I have experienced some sexual side effects.  Overall, this drug saved my life but lost its effectiveness over time.  I wish it still worked as well for me as it did initially.  Definitely worth a try.    "

Doctors seem to find this the treatment of choice for those of us who suffer from chronic pain. Chronic pain is enough to trigger severe depression in anyone. I planed to go out this weekend and have a few drinks because you can’t mix Prozac or the other medication I need to take for pain with alcohol, alcohol is a depressant so that’s done and my plan was to start Prozac on Monday but I took my first does at 2:30 a.m., Sunday because I can’t sleep (anxiety) I would like to go to bed. Prozac will make you sleepy; once your body is fully adjusted that sleepy feeling will pass. Take it at the same time every day; if the sleepy feeling is a problem take it at night before bed. I’m taking my second dose at 8:00 p.m. tonight so I can sleep and I will stay on that schedule. I don’t know why some people report weight gain and others loss, I think it’s the difference in how depression effects different people. In my case I warned my friends and family that I was starting this medication and that I will drop about 10 lbs in the first month. That’s what happened the first time I took it; I didn’t want anyone to worry. I am already small and it’ll be quite noticeable. I never had side effects before but still told my friends and family what could happen. I have a great support system and they will watch me closely for red flag side effects while I get adjusted. Prozac takes a few weeks before the full effects are felt even if you start feeling the benefits right away. If you can’t stay on this medication for the first month then you haven’t given it a chance. If you are having problems, talk with your doctor, they may need to adjust the dosage; if you can’t talk with your doctor about your concerns then you have the wrong doctor, find one you can talk to. And what ever you do don’t just stop taking it; you have to wean yourself off of it. I’ll be back in a month

In fact, I was still depressed, and gained 35 pounds. I was in a terrible fog, and felt even more depressed, just less motivated. I felt like a tranquilized animal. Which now, years later I discovered the doctor had medicated me very wrongly, and treated me falsely all along. He did not answer my questions about the drug and would just increase the dosage when I begged for answers. I left his 'care' after 3 years of being prescribed a crap drug. Thank God for second opinions, otherwise I would have been stuck in depression longer. She adjusted my care. I don't know if THAT is effective in a review, but I will report that any extreme exercise regiment or diet I was put on did nothing. Prozac keeps the 35 lbs. of extra weight on you until you are weaned off of it. Then, like magic I lost all that weight.

Even after finding a new job the low feelings continued. After speaking with my doctor he suggested a 20 mg daily dose of Prozac. Since my insurance only covers generic prescriptions I was put on a generic Prozac. Before starting the scripts I read some of the reviews of different anti-depressants and was a little hesitant to try them. I've been on this for about a month now and couldn't be happier. Little things no longer upset me, I have more energy and am actually happy to wake up in the mornings just to get things done, no more sleeping until noon. The only thing that worries me is the fact that nothing really upsets me anymore, and that can be good and bad. Another thing is my sex drive is the same but it takes a lot longer for me to have an orgasm, which my girlfriend loves. So I guess it's good all around, happy woman=happy me!

He correctly diagnosed me with Chronic General Anxiety Disorder w/ Depression. He put me on 1mg of Klonopin 3x's a day and 20mg of Prozac in the morning. I can't say I am 100%..but I feel better than I have ever felt before. The prozac instantly took that blah feeling away and the suicidal thoughts. I do have more energy now due to the prozac as well. The Klonopin helps to ease my anxiety and makes me a little drowsy..but I will take drowsy over anxiety any day..lol I have just started these meds a week ago.

I started with 10mg & am now on 80mg. Plus I'm on 300mg generic Welbutrin & low thyroid meds. I have learned to take my Prozac at night, before bed & sleep very well. I don't think it is working as well as it did in the past, I am tired all the time, but that is probably due to my lack of exercise, bad eating habits over the winter & huge amount of stress over the past 8 months. Thanks for the reviews, it's great to be able to see what others are experiencing in my age group. I know now I'm not alone. I'm going to push myself to exercise more often & be more alert to the foods I'm eating.

I had a headache everyday, sweats and my head felt like it was under water.  I could not think straight.  I was afraid to drive.  I went off for two days and I had rapid heartrate and anxiety.

Later, I was going through a very rough patch and began using Nortriptyline with the intent to use Prozac along with it for my fibromyalgia and migraines. Side effects(heart palpitations) caused me to discontinue the Nortriptyline before starting the Prozac. Then I tried Doxepin. Great stuff for depression and anxiety, but causes lots of sleepiness and heart palpitations. I was finally ready to start the Prozac 10mg. It has been 6 months now and I have had very good results. I am still on the same dose with very few side effects.I take only the Prozac now, since the Doxepin had many undesirable effects on me.I am sleepy at times and my appetite is good, but no weight gain like with the Doxepin. No sexual problems either like the latter drug gave me. I will be increasing to 20 mg soon. My only problem is that I am scared to take my migraine meds(Imitrex) due to sertonin syndrome.

I ended up blurting out every thought I had, to the point where it was embarrassing. Looking back, I think my dosage was way too high. I've been on a dozen different SSRIs, and Lexapro is the best, but you do build up an immunity over time, so combining with another drug like Wellbutrin provides a good balance (plus, it helps with the sexual side effects of all the SSRIs). Low doses of Prozac have helped my friends who suffer from PMS and post-partum depression.

668$Condition: Depression$1/8/2009 3:14:33 PM$Reviewer: Mom of two, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$5$I began taking Prozac after 4 other SSRT meds failed.  This med is in the SSRI category as well.  I have had the SAME side effects with this med as with all other SSRIs (zoloft, paxil, lexapro, etc). My side effects include: severe insomnia, headache, mood swings, fatigue, lack of interest & irritability. Though tolerable, I would be okay with the side effects if the Prozac actually worked.  I still have slight depression and anxiety, so, along with the side effects I have decided to ask my Doc for a SNRI med instead.  Do your research on these anti-depressants to find what is right for you.

Prozac certainly stopped the depression - in less than 2wks I was completely homicidal! If I'd had the means I would have been a clock-tower sniper!  PROZAC IS DANGEROUS!!!! Needless to say, I was taken off the drug immediately - put into respite and lost my son until 'I' could prove that I was sane.  Thanks Prozac.  
673$Condition: Depression$12/31/2008 6:46:44 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$My doctor put me on Prozac 20mg. after being on Wellbutrin for a couple years. The Wellbutrin just wasn't cutting it anymore. I felt angry all the time and felt like all I did was yell at my kids, and the anger was intense. My doctor said I could just stop the Wellbutrin and start the Prozac. Not a good idea! I started having flu-like symptoms and realized it was from stopping the Wellbutrin (flu-like symptoms are part of Wellbutrin withdrawal). It lasted about two weeks. Now I'm feeling fine, and the Prozac has helped me immensely. The major side effect, for me, is the inability to have an orgasm. It sucks, but I'd rather deal with that than have my children remember me as a raging lunatic! Sometimes you have to take the bad with the good.

Family history of Depression/bi-polar disease.I had lumbar back surgury that failed and 2 Yrs ago I broke my leg and my significant other died. I went into major depession and anxiety. My Psyciatrist put me on several different meds. I took Cymbalta 60mg for 2 years and it stopped working. It did help my pain alot. Then I started getting major side effects, went thru all medical testing for the symptoms, gastric,suicicidal,weight gain without changing eating habits,self esteem lowered, and concluded it was the Cymbalta! I tried to get off and after 3 days had bad withdrawal symptoms. I am on Prozac 20mg for 2 weeks and lowered my Cymbalta to 30mg. It is definetly better. I don't feel suicidal. Prozac is working great! I do think you need to be on it for wks before you see any change,side effects go away. Great for PMS, I am feeling like myself!!Thank god!! Sex drive has come back.

Because he was never asked about his depression or saw a doctor the day he was handed the script or was followed up on for any of the warnings signs on this drug.

I take 10mg of the liquid generic fluoxetine in the morning every day. I have experienced a great deal of drowsiness and hypersomnia, which was honestly pretty nice at first, as I wasn't sleeping much before due to the depression, but after a few days it became a huge inconvenience. By the second week of treatment I was constipated. At the moment I haven't had a complete bowel movement for five days and I feel bloated, crampy, and miserable. My IBS hasn't been this bad in a long time. There has been no effect on mood, although, to be fair, the medication isn't supposed to take effect for a few weeks yet. I'm planning to go off this medication and try something else.

When taking Prozac, or any medication for depression, it goes hand in hand with exercise. I have found this drug to be amazing after two short months.  I feel absolutely great, like I never have before, love my life and my children/family and have done a complete life turnaround.  However, for those of you who enjoy a few cocktails, with the holidays approaching, BEWARE!!!! Three glasses of wine used to be nothing for me before the medication, and now after 3-4 drinks, you can have blackout instances without even realizing it.  It is really scary.  Please take control and caution on the alcoholic intake come the holiday season.  It can be very dangerous for those who are new to the drug.....

I feel sweaty then I'm shaking. I figured all the side effects would just go away, my doctor told me to stick with it and they'll fade. But I can't get in touch with him for 2 more weeks (I go to a free un insured place for working people). So I decided to stop taking it. I slept! For for two days. I had major withdraw symptoms.

Once I had to stop taking it (about a year ago) because I realized it had stopped working; the Lexapro wasn't good, but it got me off Prozac for a bit (1-3 months? can't remember), and the Prozac was just great after that. Unfortunately, my dr. told me to try Cymbalta; after 2 weeks of constipation, extreme dry mouth, worsening of an OCD symptom, and depression, I just can't wait for my new prescription of Prozac (generic) to be filled.

People accused me of being on drugs...yes, it was that bad..also, my grandfather killed himself(which was really unexpected & out of character) while on Prozac.

Both of the other times, I felt edgy and antsy in the beginning, and then the anti-depressant aspect kicked in and I felt pretty good.  This time, I've been on it 4 weeks. It has helped with anxiety, but the depression is still here, and still pretty bad in the mornings.  I've never felt this erratic with it before, so I don't know if this is typical, or maybe related to the fact that I've gone on and off it a few times, or am not up to the dosage I last took or what. But overall, the last two times I felt it was my miracle drug, so I'm going to give it more time this time and hope it works again.

I have been on MANY medications for Treatment Refractory Depression and, this has been my life saver. I tried it many years ago, and became very agitated / akathesiastic at only 10 mg., so, when it was suggested to me in replacement of Imipramine during a recent life crises I was hesitant, but figured I had nothing to lose at that point. I am so happy that I did. I have my life back.

I also take 70 mg. of Vyvanse for A.D.D. in the morning, and have noticed that Prozac really helps to even out the stimulant mood variations (I used to take Adderall which made me go up and down alot), and I have noticed that Prozac along with a stimulant makes the stimulant effect noticeably less mood-altering. I feel less ""Up"" from the stimlant, but also don't feel it can bring me as ""down"". To the point where the only difference I can see is that, when the Vyvanse isn't in me, I am just much less organized but my emotional world is not much different. 

I also take Trazadone, 50 mg. per night for bed as Prozac makes me noticeably prone to fatigue during the days and insomnia often. This is a great medication for regulating circadian rythems.

It helped, and I was later able to taper off and then quit. I resumed Prozac during a painful divorce and again got better and felt able to discontinue the drug after a time. Each time I remained off the drug for an extended period, however, my depression reoccured regardless of my current life circumstances. Currently, I have been on Prozac for about three years. I am perimenopausal and believe it is the only thing that keeps me from feeling the severe mood swings that are so common with the hormone fluctuations associated with menopause. I also attribute Prozac with saving my life as it has allowed me to function more normally than when I have not been taking it. There were many times I felt like giving up prior to taking this drug. Now, I can't imagine not living every day to the fullest. This is my experience but I would encourage people who try this drug to stick with it for awhile if the side effects are not too severe. For I believe, it is the long-term effects of the medicine that are so beneficial. I also take a small dosage of Trazadone at night as a sleep aid and take it and the Prozac only before bedtime.

It helped at first.I have been on prozac for several years now. I am now expeiencing mild memory loss, and my mind seems to wander aimlessly. Aftersome research, I discovered prozac contains fluoride, the same stuff as in toothpaste. Fluoride is an extremely toxic poison, which is even added to our drinking water. Fluoride has been proven to cause dementia, and can lead to alzheimers. Prozac is also been known to cause suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I have since stopped taking prozac, but am still feeling the effects of this toxic drug. I would never recommend prozac to anybody I cared about. Research all your medications...thoroughly before you take it. You will be very surprised at some of the ingredients they add to medicine. It is pretty scary stuff!! An informed patient, is a healthier patient!!

I didn't realize how deep into depression I was until the Prozac started working for me.  My mood swings were eliminated, I liked my husband again, and I was happy...which was something I hadn't felt for years!  I really wish I would have been brave enough years before to admit that I needed some help...it saddens me to think of the ""living"" that I lost out on in my youth.  
I took it religiously for the first year, and then developed some sort of itchy body rash.  Two biopsies could not determine the cause.  After 6 months the rash went away.  Near the end of the first year of 20-30mg I was frustrated that I even had to take anything, and felt like it wasn't doing anything for me anymore.  I quit cold turkey with no side effects, but noticed after several months that I was reverting back to my mean self.  Finally, June of this year I got back on at 40mg.  It started helping right away, but now my body is once again consumed with this rash.  My skin constantly feels like it is crawling, and I wake myself at night scratching, that is when I am fortunate enough to fall asleep.  I haven't seen where anyone else has reported this side effect, but I can't trace it to anything but the Prozac.  I haven't taken a pill in 3 days, and the swelling in the bumps is going down, and while there is still an itch, it isn't as extreme as it was.  My doctor is going to switch me to Celexa, which I know nothing about.  If it works the same, but without the itch, it will be a God send!"

While I was on it, I do remember thinking more clearly and acting more decisively. It has also had a good effect on my sister, who just started it recently. I recommend trying it because the side effects may or may not bother everyone."

Sometimes I get ""too much music"" repeating in my head, so I'll take it every other day until the music lessens.

After awhile, I got a kind of a tolerance, and I realized when my family doctor described it, I wasn't sufficiently treating my depression--which I have had for over 30 years, because Prozac is just a SSRI and I needed the SSNRI, the neuropinephrine part of treatment. I started to have ""breakthrough symptoms"" of crying and low energy. But it really helped with my premenopausal rough periods, unlike the Effexor I am on (which helps more for depression but not my periods.) Oh, perfection and the quest for it! I am just glad I met Prozac and I read Prozac Nation and all the other literature, Listening to Prozac. We will look back on this time in mental health and realize we had development of a good thing for a true brain illness. I am just grateful to have better meds. Now I need to accept my illness and stay on medication. And I am grateful for sites like this, psychiatric researchers and providers that care, pharm companies that do work on meds because they want to improve care for mentally ill people."

I had many (too many)conditions for which it prescribed...Bulimia, depression,Bipolar and panic attacks. (fun, huh?) I eventually stopped my Bulimia, but that was due to a wonderful treatment center and MUCH needed bathroom supervision. I don't credit Prozac with my 'cure'. Three months ago I was realizing that the Prozac was doing nothing for my depression-actually at a point, I felt as if was making me MORE depressed.  I would yawn all day at work and immediately would pass out on the coach while watching TV...always. Along with the help of my Dr., we decided that Prozac wasn't for me. We decided to switch to (can I say this?) another form of antidression...W&*lb&^rin.

Now the constant sense of dread and sadness that I lived with for so long is gone, which is just fantastic!!!  I still have to deal with small bouts of depression/anxiety, which I would consider to be at normal levels of every day living.  The only draw back is that I find that I am a little drowsy at times (and I only take 10mg/day), but for the sense of peace that I have, the trade off is worth it!

Read the reviews and side effects before I started taking the med & they scared me to death! Thought I would @ least give the med a try.  Have had NO adverse side effects.  I go to sleep better @ night & do not take any OTC sleep meds.  (Took OTC sleep meds for @ least 2 yrs or more). Before starting this med, I cried alot over the least little thing and got very anxious during the day especially if there was the least little unsettling news. I also have a Rx for Xanax 1mg, but seldom use it. I have used this before in the past (because of my divorce and a VERY difficult daughter) and liked it, but I am very cautious not to take it unless I think I need it, I do not want to become dependent. My doctor told me that my family & friends would most likely notice a change before I would and he's right!

808$Condition: Depression$5/20/2008 7:23:39 PM$Reviewer: anonymous, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking 20mg of Fluoxetine about a month and a half ago to try to get a hold of my depression. I have had depression on and off for probably 6-8 years or so (I am now 24). I've tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and another anti-depression medicine, but Fluoxetine seems to be helping me the best. Some of the other medications actually made things worse for me. I have been dealing with a lot of stressful things in my life over the past few years (and even more here recently), but this has definitely helped me tremendously. The only negative side effect I have experienced thus far with Fluoxetine is losing some sexual desire. This was/is a problem for me because my wife and I are currently trying to conceive. I have never had a problem in this department and actually I would say I had more desire when it comes to sex than most others. Just here recently I think I am starting to get back to normal a little bit in that department. I feel like my sexual desire may be coming back to me like it was before getting on this medication. Overall, I really like Fluoxetine and I think it's worth a shot if you are experiencing depression.

I never noticed a dramtic difference in how I felt BUT my family did. They swear it worked wonders. Looking back now it did. I am just starting on it again now. A thing to keep in mind with anti depresants is that it takes time (sometime 6 months) to work. I know I have taken many of them but prozac worked best. I have noticed through my experience and reading up on it that some work well for people but not others, so even though this worked well for me it might not for you.  DON'T expect a miracle from anti depressants they work gradually and you might not know it. Others will notice a difference in you more than you do.

Our life has been a living hell since then. Many Chemo. tratments, hospital stays, a stem cell transplant and nothing has helped. I did some research on the medications my wife was taking prior to the cancer. I went to Eli Lilly's web site and researched the side effects of Prozac. One of the side effects of a high dose is the inflamation of the lympnodes which can lead to Lymphoma cancer. I lowered the dose my wife now takes to 40 MG a day. We can not stop the Prozac now because of this horrible cancer and the depression involved. We are a young retired couple living a life of hell, I feel because of Prozac.

I also thought I had anxiety which was severe enough to cause shaking and most of the time just felt like constant static. I've been taking 20 mg generic Prozac for 10 months now and friends & family & I have noticed a very positive difference. For a time, I thought it was becoming less effective but my Psychiatrist suggested a Cognitive Therapy class. The combination of Prozac, 1-on-1 Therapy, group therapy, and the Cognitive Therapy class have each contributed to a significant reduction in my symptoms. I think it is normal to have positive and negative feelings when reacting to normal events in my life and that continues to happen ALTHOUGH the times when I get down about something do not last for extended periods of time like they used to and I don't get as severely depressed as before. I can still feel sadness about things but it's not the unreasonable ""crying for no reason"" that I used to experience. I consider Prozac one of many tools that my Psychiatrist has given me. I feel that it's the combination of the Prozac and the different forms of therapy that have eased my symptoms. Additionally, maintaining my weight and health and energy levels are important to me and none of these have been affected by taking Prozac. Now, instead of feeling depressed or anxious, I feel more positive,  clear-headed, and static-free. "

Not only did it increase my depression and anxiety but,it also created irrational thoughts which seriously made me think and feel - as if I was going crazy, almost if I had totally ""lost it"" mentally. Actually thought about checking myself into the hospital, but feared if they admitted me, they would lock me up and throw away the key. Wow, it's simply frightening how   20 mg of Prozac can make a person think that they are truly going crazy and insane!
I acknowledge that I do struggle with depression, but I also make a conscious effort to keep things in proper perspective. When I contacted my physician, she wanted me to increase my dosage. Obviously, I refused to continue on the same course - I would rather take nothing at all and ""suffer from the blues"", than suffer from extreme irritability,agitation, and irrational thinking. Thank goodness she switched me to Paxil - atleast now, I have no adverse side effects"
834$Condition: Depression$3/18/2008 8:19:02 PM$Reviewer: $2$1$4$This medicine worked horribly for me. I didn't feel any better and it made me gain tons of weight. My doctor didn't believe me when I told her that I gained between 10 - 15 pounds in 2 months because of this medicine she told me that it was my eating habits. As soon as I started seeing another doctor and switched medications (which I was then told that this medication is mainly used for anxiety which I don't have), I literally droped 10 pounds in 3 days. If you have issues with this medication, trust me there are alternatives out there that work a lot better without the side effects.

I could not concentrate at all and it was very disturbing. Interestingly, I had no side effects for the first week.  It was the second week when the dizziness started, and it just would not stop. I think it hit me once the drug built up in my system. I thought side effects would occur as soon as I started taking the drug; no one told me and nothing I read indicated that the problems could be delayed. I wonder if others have had this same experience. I was determined to be patient with this drug, but the dizziness was just too extreme. I know this drug has been great for many, but it just wasn't for me. I am going to try something else. Hope this is helpful to someone.

(The first 1-2 weeks on it made me feel awful...but I hung in there and now I'm fine.)I was very reluctant to take it at first (it took an unprompted crying fit in my doctor's office for him to ask me to consider it.) I was afraid it would turn me into someone I'm not, but actually, I feel more like myself (minus the excessive anxiety). I used to cry most days and worry to the point of having anxiety attacks. I no longer cry unless there's actually a reason. I do experience pretty serious fatigue (to the point where I fall asleep watching movies quite often). I've started consuming more caffeine and that has helped. (I would love any suggestions for what to do about the fatigue besides caffeine...)

I told them how horrible it made me feel.  They said someone should never just stop and start a new drug within a day like that.  The dose should've been monitored.  Never ever take prozac.

911$Condition: Depression$11/3/2007 12:22:36 AM$Reviewer: Kristy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$3$5$I feel much better than not being on it, but it does cause extreme drowsiness; to the point of not being able to get out of bed for hours. I am less motivated to do anything and haven't been out of the house in weeks. My doctor just increased it so we will see the outcome.

But over time it made me very tired to the point where I couldn't get anything done because I was so unmotivated, didn't care, and was TIRED! I was on it two times in a row for a year each time. 
914$Condition: Depression$10/26/2007 11:38:41 AM$Reviewer: Abby, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Prozac has given me back my life.  The doctor tried other medications and none of them were right for me.  However, Generic Prozac was terrible.  When I went on that it was as if I went cold turkey off regular prozac and started taking sugar pills.  I went into a severe depression on the generic and it took many months to get my life back on track.  Name Brand Prozac is wonderful -- Generic Prozac should be taken of the market.

I stopped using it after about four years and the b_tchiness came back big time.  I also had a lot of vasovagal syncopy (passing out) episodes using prozac (which doctors told me was anxiety/panic attacks).  I didn't feel anxious and I certainly wasn't panicking about anything.

The drug helps others, so it probably just didn't mesh well with my body chemistry. After trying different dosages for over 2 years, the doctor finally switched me to another drug.
