I have been dealing with this for over 20 years and Prozac has been a God send. If you've tried everything and nothing has worked I'd give Prozac a try, it's worth it!!!

3$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$4/28/2019 7:44:18 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$5$4$I have been taking this medication for 5 years at 30mg, when I was first diagnosed with MDD and GAD. It made my life a lot easier to live, once it kicked in. Only negative thing is that in my personal experience, it became less effective over time. I recently relapsed (in the mental health sense) I now have to take several other medications in addition to this to get back on my feet again. 
4$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/31/2019 10:58:06 AM$Reviewer: awesome , 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$awesome medicine, I suffer from anxiety, i took 20mg and after a month my anxiety disappear completely, I'm  on this from 2.5 years, but it makes me eat alot, I was 60kg and now I'm 85kg, it makes me enjoy eating and crave for sugar, but I'm okay :) my life become so bright and shiny..
5$Condition: Depression$3/25/2019 11:59:33 PM$Reviewer: Rebecca, 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$When my doctor mentioned Prozac to treat my depression eight months ago, I hesitated to take it. He explained the benefits of prozac. It took me a month to see the positive results. I am so glad I did. I feel wonderful. No more anxiety/panic attacks. 
6$Condition: Depression$3/23/2019 10:17:09 AM$Reviewer: rosan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$5$It definitely helped me through hard times. On the good side, i was neutral emotionally. On the bad side I got pssd and also rage symptoms (that i never had) that may remain or may not for the rest of my life.
7$Condition: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder$1/12/2019 7:27:57 PM$Reviewer: MrsH, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$5$4$I started taking this medication a year ago. The first three weeks I was on a very low dosage of 20 mgs but it didnÃ¢Â?Â?t worked. I was still having a lot of anxiety and a lot of ocd symptoms. I was then prescribed 40 mg which helped a lot to stabilize my mood and feel normal again. Side effects while being on 40 mg were no desire to sex or delayed to organ. My dr said to lower it to 30 mg and it has worked wonders! This is just my experience and it may work different in other people but IÃ¢Â?Â?m thankful that it was a good one.

9$Condition: Depression$12/8/2018 3:36:15 PM$Reviewer: Pdee, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$3$3$I have been taking this daily for 19 years. I do not like taking it or the stigma attached. But if I do not take this there is a rapid decline into my behaviour before starting it. Paranoia, ocd and massive depression returns. Tried to reduce dose to come off it, I can't ever according to doctor. I believe taking this has saved me, without it I would be dead. 
10$Condition: Depression$8/28/2018 4:17:48 AM$Reviewer: StaySafe, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month$1$1$1$I see from reviews here a lot of people had good results, I am not one of those people.. Everyone reacts differently..  I took one pill a long time ago and I actually had side-effects that lasted for 10 years. It gave me panic attacks and the taste of burning plastic in my mouth... My first day on Prozac I ended up calling 911, cause I thought I was having a heart attack, but it ended up being my first panic attack along with the taste of burning plastic in my mouth and strange thoughts (disturbing thoughts).. After that ordeal I ended up throwing away that bottle of Prozac.. I find it strange they wont list all the side-effects on this page.. They ask you to talk to your doctor about additional side-effects.. Thats crazy.. I recall the side-effects list being a lot longer back in the day.. And they aren't pretty.. I highly recommend keeping a close eye on a family member that is taking this medication and make sure to ask them if they are having strange thoughts.. You just dont know what someone is capable on this medication.. It can be very dangerous if someone has as severe reaction as myself.. I originaly requested a perscription of prozac from my doctor due to depression from my business going Bankrupt.. I regret ever taking this drug.. I will never take another prescription drug ever again.. So make sure to monitor your loved ones if they must take this drug, cause anything is possible.. 
11$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/28/2018 3:00:55 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $2$2$2$I was an original Prozac case study decades ago. Prozac is excellent! This generic poison is nothing like the real thing. Of course it's to save money. I understand that one is a right handle molecule and the other is a left handle molecule. I have over 20 years of taking this. I was off for short term, trying every single antidepressant and chose to go back to this, and accepted that I'm going to be depressed. Extreme weight gain with generic, weight loss with name brand.

Decided along with my Physician to stop the use of Paxil by reducing dosage which was extremely difficult. Experienced brain fog, memory and confusion issues along with fatigue and overall lethargy. Replaced Paxil with Prozac and after a couple of months started to feel like my old self. It takes time to work because the transition is a slow process you may gradually feel better each day.
14$Condition: Other$3/17/2018 5:21:15 PM$Reviewer: birdlady2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$Horrible experience. I was having waking dreams and could not tell reality from dream. Some quack told me it was for chronic pain and after a month on it I went insane and drove my car into my house thinking I was dreaming. 
15$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$3/8/2018 3:26:28 PM$Reviewer: Dawna, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Living situation created anxiety in me and therapist said I was depressed (I didnt think so) so prescribed Prozac. I went into some manic zone spending money I didnt have, nothing bothered me, even my situation of living with a full blown alcoholic. Credit card bills started rolling in and I freaked out. Stopped the meds immediately after one month of use.  Within a few days I felt normal again. Never would try it again. My daughter just had the same reaction to it and has now quit taking it. She was dealing with very serious problems, (relationships,health,etc)and suddenly didn't care about anything unless it was fun! After a month, she quit Prozac and is now dealing with life's issues, even when it is hard.
16$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$1/23/2018 2:58:58 PM$Reviewer: NotAFan, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$3$"This medication also caused suicidal thoughts, though not as bad as Zoloft.  As a result, I was shamefully ""Baker Acted"" (they really need to do something about that stupid ""law"") a few times.  The precautions state that the side effect is only prevalent among younger people, but I am in my mid-50s.  I now refuse to take ANY SSRIs or ""anti-depressants"" prescribed to me and instead rely on other non-medicated techniques to get through depression.  I say PROCEED WITH CAUTION unless you want huge medical bills...(guess who they charge for Baker-Acts....YOU...only ADDING to the depression!!!)"

I was VERY depressed and didn’t see an end in sight when I started this drug and now I feel like a different person. My dr said it’s amazing with women, so maybe that’s why it helped me so much. But either way I am very thankful for this. It also gives me a little bit of energy, it doesn’t make me tired like others I’ve tried.

I have no sex drive and have gained quite a bit of weight as well as being tired all the time and needing an increased amount of sleep. I have been dealing with the side effects because the benefits have been outweighing but it's time for a change. 
However, this drug really did change my life- I no longer had a very short fuse and was able to deal with my anxiety."

I'm going on to week 5 of using so I know I have another 1-3 weeks before fully in effect. The only downside I've experienced is the complete obliteration of my sex drive and ability to climax.

24$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/11/2017 5:33:45 AM$Reviewer: Beto , 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$3$I have been taking this medication for three months now. I suffered from severe depression and was on Zoloft. Wellbutrin, then Prozac. All of these medications had a side effects on me. I am still taking Prozac and the first to weeks I experience headaches, nausea and loss of appetite. My doctor told me this would be normal for the first two weeks. After week two side effects went away, then I lost sex drive and appetite has picked up. I went from having sex 4 times a week to twice a month, such a huge difference. These medications I just feel you need to sacrifice something like Zoloft (no energy), Wellbutrin (high sex drive, weight gain), and Prozac (no sex drive, big appetite). 
25$Condition: Depression$5/21/2017 1:14:30 PM$Reviewer: KR, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$3$Side effects outweighed the benefits for me. Terrible night sweats (soaking the sheets!) and jaw clenching, but the kicker was the irrational bruising. If I so much as knicked my shin on anything I'd bruise like a peach and healing time was 3x longer than usual for any cuts etc.

I switched to Prozac, and the 'foginess' is gone. My mind is clear. I stopped over eating. I've stopped napping. I had no side effects. For me, this works.
27$Condition: Panic Disorder$4/20/2017 3:32:57 PM$Reviewer: Tiamani, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$"Hello all,
It is April 20th 2017. I am 20 yrs old female. I started taking prozac in january 2017. I hated prozac. I was never depressed in the first place to begin with. My paychiatrist (Dr Shanique Cartwright- on allentown rd in camp springs, maryland) prescribed me the pills. They did not work for me. I have not been taking the pills since april 17th. So its been 3 days and i feel better and beginning to be back to my normal ways and more alert and less depressed. I have read online that people who stopped taking it feels good at first then it starts to kick in like emotions and stuff trying to get it out of ur system. I guess withdrawal? But I couldnt do prozac anymore. Made me VERY depressed and annoyed all the time. Didnt work for me. Made me nautious all day every day and felt sick all the time. I also became hypochondriac. Neck and back pains and sore muscles as well all the time. Im so glad to be off of it. I am going to try to work on my anxiety with lorazepam (ativan) whenever I feel the need to take it. My ativan medication is only 0.5mg. "
28$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$4/6/2017 10:22:52 AM$Reviewer: Macmissy, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$My first few weeks were somewhat challenging. Dizziness and total lack of motivation. I would come home from work and would easily go to bed.  This has continued a little over 6 weeks. I have found having some green tea in the afternoon helps me be more motivated in the late afternoon. I'm able to get home and go for a workout.  I have had on and off night sweats but nothing too alarming.  Prozac for me has been a life saver. The bad thoughts have gone away. My OCD isn't nearly as bad and I genuinely feel better.  I am on a very low dose. I would recommend this for anyone with PTSD, Depression and Anxiety. The overall benefits truly outweigh the side effects for me.

Saved my life, honestly. 80 mg a day. I'm a college student so this helps me keep up with the hectic pace of the ten week quarter system as well as the tragedies that occur in life.

35$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/8/2017 8:08:07 PM$Reviewer: $4$4$4$So I started with the 10mg and worked up to the 40mg, and It's worked wonders for me.

The only complaint I'd have is I'm constantly exhausted, but honestly that just might be my mental health lmao.
36$Condition: Depression$12/29/2016 12:45:10 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$3$On it for just over a month. It did away with my suicidal thoughts and overall improved my mood but the side effects were too much for me. It caused me to be almost constantly drowsy and unable to focus as I had no energy and was often on the verge of falling asleep. I would constantly pass out midday for an hour or so at a time, and then would struggle to stay asleep at night. I would wake up in the middle of night and had more intense nightmares. These were all daily occurrences. I also experienced dizziness and lightheadedness every few days. Sometimes I'm not sure if Prozac actually helped my mood, or if it just made me too tired to feel anything. I felt fine emotionally but had no motivation to do anything but sleep the entire day.

I've had a serve concussion and it's changed my whole life. I'm don't react good with most medications. I haven't had any problems so far expect for when I forgot to take it one day and when I ate it without eating first. So both times my fault. I started with super low doses. I'm going up to 60 mg, but I'm at 30 mg right now. I've already noticed a difference and so has my mom. I have more energy and I've been keeping my room organized (which never happened before). I used to have sesures if I even thought something bad or saw something bad. They were from my emotions. Im positive about getting up to my full dose to start seeing some huge differences. Just remember everyone's body is different so if it works for me it might not work for you or some medication will work for you and not work for me.

Nausea, high anxiety, nightmares, bad headaches, dizziness to the point of falling, restless, reage increase, constipation,guilty feelings worsened, pounding heartbeat.

My parents had to take her for a few weeks until I could get on the right medication and get my mental health straightened out.

I did not react well to any of them or they did nothing.  After several years of going without medications and trying to manage on my own, I broke down and saw a new dr.  She said Prozac is an oldie but a goodie so I gave it a shot.  The first 2 months where awful.  I was lethargic and foggy headed.  But being persistent, I stayed on.  This started in June 2015.  Today I am a happier person.  I do not stress like I used to or blow up over nothing.  I used to also have headaches almost daily, I have had maybe 1 in 3 months.  My emotions are more in check and anytime I run into a situation that adds extra anxiety, I have Klonopin to back me up.  But that's for another review.  Prozac is definitely worth the trial.

The only side effects that I am seeing is gas, nausea, diarrhea, and some jitteriness. But if this will help with my depression then I am just fine with that. I am worried about weight gain since it is an SSRI, but who knows, maybe I'll be able to lose a few pounds. :) "

I stopped taking it abruptly due to circumstance even though I knew I shouldn't have done it that way, but I felt awesome for about two months, better than ever, started losing the weight, had energy, but then after that I just crashed and burned and I've ended up worse than before, possibly from taking SSRIs on and off since childhood, possibly because of circumstance or other variables, but it definitely didn't help me in the long run.

My mother told me i was talking about killing myself the second day i was on it, and i cant recall doing such a thing at all. I suffer from bipolar disorder, and coping with depression on a mood stabilizer is better than being on this drug in my opinion, which i will never consume again. I was only on 20 mg. for a week so I knew what i was experiencing was from Prozac. I had the same experience while taking Celexa. I will never take an SSRI again. I cant wait for this stuff to be completely out of my system. This drug might work for some, but it was a nightmare for me.

After going on the higher doses, my life has changed completely. I went from having intrusive thoughts so bad I could not leave my room to being able to go on vacations and have relationships. It never made all of the symptoms go away, that's where the therapist helped. But, the thoughts that do end up popping up so not last nearly as long and I don't have the obsession for it. I also have Anorexia and when I was in treatment they lowered it back down and my symptoms came back with a vengeance. So, I know that Prozac has been a life saver for me. It has not worked for treating the eating disorder, which is to be expected.

Albeit the depression greatly improved it did not help with the weight gain, and this one is one of the few anti-depressants that claim ""may cause weight loss"".  I could not be so lucky.  I've gained 20 lbs in a year.  Since my depression has greatly improved my doctor is weening me off.  Hopefully I will lose this weight.  But overall, I have to rate it as GREAT because it has helped with my depression and that after all is why it was prescribed."

We (my doctor and I) have experimented with other medications, but this is the only one that is effective for me.  We have tried modifying the dosage to up it to 60 mg.  At first the brain fog lifted and I felt wonderful...but after a week or so, my body adjusted and the fog was back.  We then tried going the other direction, lowering the dosage to the minimum  effective dosage. Now I take 10 mg a day and have for the last four or five years.  I take it in the morning so I can get through a day of work without arguing with anyone.  The dosage could probably be a touch higher so I didn't argue with family at night, but I am happy to keep my job at this point.  Prozac has made that possible and I highly recommend it at a very low dose.  It doesn't take much to effect your chemical imbalances.

The dose was increased when my therapist discovered I was still self harming and since then I've had a lot of memory loss, abnormal sweating, dizziness, and a few times in school my legs have given out. Two weeks ago I overdosed on ibuprofen in an attempt to take my life and was in a mental hospital. The increased suicidal thoughts and other side effects only appeared when my dose went from 20 to 40 milligrams. I've also had a huge decrease in appetite and lost almost 20 lbs by now. I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow for the first time since I got out of the hospital and I'm going to ask her about my dosage and if any changes could be made to it. My ocd and anxiety issues have probably increased since I started taking it. It does help with depression and lack of motivation, but honestly, I'm not really sure if it's worth it.

It has been a life saver.  I am also on 300mg of Wellbutrin XL & 20mg of Adderall.  Iv been on those two for over a year now, but within the past few months I started to get really depressed again & was fixing to commit suicide.  Once I started taking the Prozac it was a complete turn around.  My thoughts of suicide went away.  Side effects I've been experiencing are sweating, yawning, loss of appetite & trouble sleeping at night.  But these side effects are slowly fading except for the loss of appetite, which doesn't bother me.  :)  Prozac has done wonders for my depression. I'm more social now & my fear of public places has gone down a lot. It's also helping me not obsess about food or my diet & OCD.  Hope it continues to help.
101$Condition: Depression$1/6/2015 4:26:12 PM$Reviewer: Sweetdeja, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I have been on Prozac for about 6 weeks and have had many of the side affects like nausea, headaches, backache,itching all over. weight loss, diarrehea, loss of libido, sleeplessness, tiredness, restless. legs and my dr still wants me to stay on the medication for a little longer.  I feel very little relief from depression/anxiety. I also take trazadone to sleep every night and Ativan for anxiety.  I tried Prozac 25 years ago and it worked great for about a year until I had a family tragedy and had to be put on Wellbrutrin which worked for over 10 years.  Then my new dr added lamictal, cymbalta and abilify which worked very well until my insurance changed and I could no longer afford the cymbalta or abilify.  I was put on Zoloft, Effexor that did not help at all. That is when the Prozac was added.  I have not felt like myself since.  I want to stay in the house and in bed all day and night, can't eat due to nausea, have lost 25 pounds (which I don't mind). I have asked my dr to give me something else on several occasions only to have to say yo give it more time. I am going into treatment in a week and will have another psychiatrist work with me and my meds and maybe we can work this out.  I am not saying Prozac is bad, it just doesn't work for everyone. If your dr doesn't work with you get a second opinion. This disease is nothing to play with.

History included multiple brain trauma (football), leading to major depressive episodes and suicide attempts in early 20's. I experienced relief of primary symptoms within 30min of administering the med, which everyone says is impossible (similar reaction in other family members). Increased concentration, alleviation of depressive symptoms etc. was amazing.  Remember not every drug in this family is the same nor are off label meds. Fluoxitine (Prozac) gave me great help until it just gave out on me after ~5 yrs (apparently the MDs call this pooping out) Other SSRIs were not the same (as of course they have different shapes) and I am certain their neurological function is not the same and remains very poorly understood (no matter what your MD pretends - this is a very imprecise practice) Bottom line, Prozac for me was amazing, other SSRIs I have taken I would say range from ineffective to VERY DANGEROUS.  Be careful what MDs perscribe, stick to brand names, and don't be afraid to talk to your DR about discontinuing meds that make you sick (side effects happen, but finding a good Dr is much much harder than finding a Dr. who will use shotgun Tx trying each one of of these medications hoping to get it right).  Try to Find an MD who has seen lots of people like you, the chance their experience will transform your care is much much higher. Many of these SSRIs are being promoted to General Practitioners who have no business treating psychiatric patients with strong and potentially dangerous meds. Get a Shrink, This Will be a fight, but a good psychiatrist is worth his weight in gold. Good luck.

I've been on it for about 6 or 7 weeks now. The medication I was taking for my Depression stopped being effective awhile ago. I had thoughts of suicide daily, no motivation or energy to even shower. I wouldn't even leave my home for as long as a month. 

My doctor never put me on Prozac before, there was a reason. But, I was sent to the hospital and the psychiatrist there slowly started me on Prozac. I haven't felt this good in a long time! I don't think of suicide and I have so much motivation to get out and do things. 

I had planned to take my life on or near my next birthday. I didn't want to live the miserable life I was living. Now, I see just how much I have to live for! Also, I'm not as emotional as I was before. Certain things don't bother me anymore. I have a new outlook on life!

109$Condition: Other$9/28/2014 10:58:37 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$I took Prozac for generalized anxiety (an off label use, but I'd heard of it working for others) and it was the worst thing I ever did. Not only did it not touch my anxiety, it also triggered a depressive episode after I hadn't had one for several years. And as far as side effects go, I had headaches and nausea that didn't fade over time, bouts of dizziness, heat rashes, sweating, tiredness, sleep problems, strange body spasms when I'd lie down (which still persist now, 1.5 years later), anorgasmia and reduced sensitivity (which took a year to fully recover from), hallucinations, and 10 kilos of weight gain. It was a nightmare, and I only took it for about four months. Weaning off it also wasn't as easy as everyone else seemed to say it was. All of that said though, I don't think others should avoid it because of this - everyone has a unique reaction to each SSRI. But it was definitely a terrible, terrible drug for me and I won't be going anywhere near it again.

Not wanting to take RX in general, I've tried with my Dr's help to stop taking it 3 times over the years.  Each time, in a few months, I'd notice profound depressive symptoms returning with a vengeance, so I've stayed on it.  In the first year, we altered the dosage to get it right, and I've cut back once (didn't work) and upped the dosage once (weird side effects.) So now I'm at 40 mg on which I feel ""normal"" with minimal depressive episodes.  On doctor's suggestion I tried adding Wellbutrin to see if my libido would return, and it did.....BUT, after a few weeks Wellbutrin stopped helping my libido at all, so I just stayed with Prozac alone.  Though I have concerns about staying on it this long, I don't function well at all without it, AND it works so well, I feel so well, that I plan to keep taking it.  Healthy diet (gluten-free) has also helped with the overall effectiveness of Prozac for me.   "

At first, it worked fine alone.  Then several years ago, I was put on Symbyax (prozac plus zyprexa) and my mood switched for the better very quickly.  The downside was weight gain, so I had to get off it.  Later that year I needed something added to it, another antipsychotic (I've never been psychotic, but these meds are often used for mood stabilization).  So Abilify was added and my mood drastically changed, almost overnight.  When I lost health benefits this year recently, Risperdal was prescibed with Prozac.   Again, worked absolute wonders.  The only side effects I;ve had are slightly fatigued,  and heartburn soon after I take my morning dose.  This is curtailed by taking Prilosec along with my morning meds.  Anyway, I;ve tried a zillion antidepressants which necer worked.  Prozac along with other meds has been a lifesacer.  I'm on 40 mg.

Those are both two huge things that made me very happy about taking this drug...but the side effects were just not worth it for me. The worst side effect I faced was LOW SEX DRIVE. Actually, there was no sex drive. Not even a feeling ""down there"". It sucked. I felt my stomach tighten up after I took the pill and for the whole day I was nauseous and tired.

132$Condition: Depression$5/1/2014 8:04:30 PM$Reviewer: DrDo001, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$4$"Seemed to help somewhat initially. Have felt my total apathetic approach and response to life was perhaps linked to Prozac @ 60mg. per day in AM for over a year now. No energy nor interest in anything, good or bad! Do not want to socialize, communicate with anyone. No interest in previous hobbies, passions, career, projects, friends, travel, etc. Could just stay in bed all day every day. Accomplish only simple daily activities at home. Feel like brain is in a fog, fuzzy thinking, disorganized, distracted. Believe this is a result of the drug and its effects. Asked mental health nurse to consider changing the Rx. She wanted to increase dosage even higher, and I refused. My rationale for causation from Prozac as follows: Since it ended my road rage, only logical that it would also end energy level, interest level in life, avoidance of humans, shopping, exercising, reading, gardening. Do not believe it has improved depression at all.    

After reading these reviews of negative side effects of Prozac, I am convinced I have been accurate that behaviors have been intensified by the drug. I will change physicians, and do not think the current situation is a result of ADHD, as proposed by health care professional."

All of the other designer drugs were tried; all I got was side effects and no relief.  I had heard bad things about Prozac, but after two years I was desperate and tired of the drugs not working.  My doctor put me on Prozac, and within 2 weeks my family noticed a major change. At 3 weeks I felt hopeful and happy for the first time in two years.  I have remained on this drug, and in spite of the bad rap it gets, it has been a miracle for me. The trick is having a regular psychiatrist that monitors your dose and takes blood samples to verify therapeutic dose.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Prozac.  You gave me my life back, and hope I never thought I'd have. Been on this medication for about 15 years; each time they have tried to take me off of it and put me on something else, I have descended into the abyss.  You can trust this drug unless you are bipolar and misdiagnosed as depressed.

I can't fall asleep easily without the TV on, but am attributing this more to the fact that I start thinking about all of my problems when I try to sleep, instead of relaxing. The TV allows me to relax and fall asleep. So am thinking that the prozac is not the causing me to not fall asleep quickly like I used to.

I began to have trouble breathing and went to the hospital. I was given an IV with an anti-inflammatory drug and some antihistamines. I was told that I had serum sickness and I was allergic to fluoxetine. I have had serum sickness once before in my life from penicillin antibiotics. Anybody who has ever had serum sickness (even to a drug totally unrelated) should never take a drug that has caused serum sickness before. Doctors need to become more aware of this before prescribing Prozac or any other drug that can cause a severe allergic reaction. Although it is very unlikely to be allergic to Prozac (as my psychiatrist said), it can happen.

Within two weeks, I noticed a slowing of my rushing thoughts and I stopped having nightmares. I've been sleeping better and my social anxiety is gone as well. I'm able to function and not panic when I know there's going to be people- of course, I still don't like to be in groups but my anxiety doesn't act up.

  The only quips I have with it are that I don't have an appetite. Which is fine, I never had much of one anyway. And very slight nausea as my body adjusted to the medication. 

With the type of drug this is, of course, you'll have a bit of apathy. It made me a little quieter and sometimes I'm content to just stare at things, but it's by no means my constant feeling on this medicine. I've got nothing but really good things to say about this insofar.

I have been taking it for over 20 years, mostly of 60mg but I was given 80 mg for several years.  It helps the binge eating and ocd and depression but much less effective over time.  
When I weaned off it my eating became out of control, my ocd and tics became very severe again, and I was desperately depressed and panicky.  I was going crazy.  It was a nightmare so I had to return to the drug.  
On the drug I have no libido and my sleep is never satisfying or deep.  I cannot cry whilst on it, and cannot grieve when I go through pain or trauma.   
While off the drug I noticed all my suppressed and undealt with trauma surfaced, and I was finally able to grieve and cry which was a relief.  I have had an incredible six years of hardship in my life but the prozac suppressed my ability to deal with it.  It internalised instead and has made my psoiasis and athritis and general immune system worse.
I gained an enormous amount of weight very quickly when off the drug due to uncontrollable binge eating, and if I had continued I would have died of ruptured stomach or coma.  I know this for a fact as in my youth, before prozac, I went to A&E a few times to evacuate my stomach or else I would have died.
I cannot have a sex life because of the prozac; it makes my vagina dry and cannot orgasm or enjoy anything, so I am very lonely and unfulfilled and have no partner.  This is the price I have to pay for not eating myself into a coma or going insane with ocd and tics.  I guess you could say it is an effective drug in that sense."

I thought I was treatment resistant for 7-9 years for PMDD and seasonal depression.  I found the Prozac to work for 22-26 hrs.  Now that I am through menopause, it pretty much is 24 hour effective.  In winter, it can shorten to 22 hours, but I just watch it. I also take it for OCD which can run in my family and I figure I had plenty of that and PTSD from my husband's drinking....and a strange encounter with a Vietnam veteran.  For the OCD part, I need quite a high dose....a dose that was decided on by me.  I have had to fight to where I am today.  PMS or PMDD can stay with you 3-4 yrs. after your last cycle.  (They do not tell you that!) I also have a better grip on living with seasonal depression after menopause.  Know yourself better than the psychiatrists, etc.  Be your own advocate.  The only way it worked for me.  I became involved in dbsalliance.org  as a leader. I had expensive food allergy testing done which was beneficial to my immune system.  I started with PMS at age 32.  I am now 58.  I hung in there and fought.
Prozac is my base medication.  And added in is Gabapentin.  Another for anxiety as needed.  I have the right combination of meds.
 (I take name brand Prozac; was very, very allergic to the generic!  Scary!  The generic did not work much at all.)  This has been my experience as female through all hormonal roller coasters.  At some point, I became Type II diabetic that they missed until I insisted on Glucose Tolerance test.  Also insisted on a female caseworker."

I also noticed that it was easier to address my panic before it became a full-blown panic attack.

My depression isn't completely gone (therapy is the other half of the treatment), but it helps me simply get out of bed and be able to do anything.

The way I take it is tedious because I'm on a wonky dosage, at 50 mg. I have to take it in 5 10 mg pills, which is unfortunate. If you're on a regular dose like 40 mg, it's a breeze to take (just one pill)."

Things that happen to me when I'm not taking the drug will send me into a spiral downward; on the drug, I deal with those little setbacks like everyone else does (I believe) - the events might bother me, but I can let them go.  Downside of the drug:  Although it doesn't take away all my sexual desire, it makes it REALLY hard to have an orgasm.

Several times over the past 15 years I thought I was ""cured"" of my depression so I stopped taking the Prozac.  Like clockwork, within 5 weeks I'd be crying in a public bathroom somewhere over something silly or angry at everyone, everywhere.  For whatever reason, this stuff works great for me."

I had been living this life since I was only 8 years old.  Last week, I was talking to my girlfriend about how miserable I was.  My sex drive was going away.  I couldn't even look her in the eyes because of my lack of confidence.  I literally was a walking, ticking time bomb full of anger.  I would wake up in the morning and not even want to shower.  My girlfriend is on prozac and we were sitting in her car and she said, ""here take a pill"" jokingly.  I said, ""let me try it.""  ""It can't hurt.""  THAT VERY SAME DAY, I started to feel normal.  The first thing that I noticed was that my anger was hugely diminished.  I noticed that my worrying was far less too.  One week later, I can honestly say that I feel so much better.  I can now see a light at the end of the tunnel.  I can actually feel feelings again other than anger.  I don't feel manic.  I feel normal again and I thank God for this medicine.

Parenthetically, Prozac (5 mg.) worked VERY quickly (I know that it usually takes about three weeks for the effects to be seen,) but I generally have a very fast reaction to drugs.

Some side effects I've had include slight worsening of vision and decreased appetite and some weight loss. (I'm not complaining at all about the latter.) Unlike Lexapro, which I had tried, Prozac has not (yet?) caused me to have hand tremors, which Lexapro did after about six months."

One doctor at that time, told the family, our mother should not have been on Prozac in her condition and with her sucicidal thoughts. Our family did not know what to do, followed doctors instructions. Knowing what we know now, we would have done things alot different. We were approached at that time to go after the doctors that treated my mom or the makers of Prozac (Lily). We feel my mom and dad may be alive today had my mother been treated properly, prescribed the correct medication. If one anti-depressant did not work, they would have her try another one. Like a guinea pig. I know in my heart, things would have turned out differently had we had the knowledge and help in treating my mom.  More needs to be done in treating Mental Illness.

I would only have breathing difficulty lying down, therefore, I woke up 3 to 4 time nightly to use inhaler.  I ran out of the prozac and have not been able to pick uup from pharmacy since I fell and in a lot  of pain.  Suddenly, the breathing difficult disappeared, had no asthma, and for first time in last couple mornings did not wake up with headache and shivering or quivering all over.  I could not figure why suddenly the asthma went away and I have been sleeping all night......It was then I realized the only change I made was not getting my prozac refilled.

I attribute it to being peri-menopausal.

My Doctor tried to put me on Welbutrin but I sincerely didn't feel like I was depressed.  In fact, I'm happy 99% of the time - I was just crying so easily!  I tried Welbutrin once (literally, one tablet) and felt like a zombie.  I told my Doctor ""never again!""  After another year of crying, I finally agreed to try Prozac.  I could tell the difference the first day.   What a relief!  I'm back to my old normal self and don't feel any side effects.  

The first 2 weeks she had me on 10 mg / day, then raised me up to 20 mg / day.  I had mild side effects the first two weeks (a little jittery, diarrhea, feeling like I needed a nap in the middle of the day) so I was worried about taking the higher dosage - but strange thing was, as soon as I started the higher dose, I stopped having the side effects.  

So stick with it, give it at least a month and if it's not doing what you need it to do, try another type of medication. "

348$Condition: Depression$4/11/2012 1:16:49 PM$Reviewer: TeeLady, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have used this med for over 20 years. I was at a point of being suicidal at the time but I recommend counseling along with any antidepressnt drug if your situation is serious.  Mine was. I was so depressed for so long that it was hard for my body to let go and be less depressed, but after a few weeks along with conseling I realized I was beginning to do better. Over the years, circumstances got better, so I began taking 10 mg every other day because its half life is longer than most of the other meds.  I now take none and am maintaining pretty good at present because life circumstances got better.  I've looked at other antidepressants but I will probably use Prozac again should I need it. I still suggest seeing a pshycologist or pshychiatrist for evaluation before starting any antidepressant.  Depression is caused by a lot of different things and one pill by itself may not fix the problem. You must peel the layers off of depression like the layers of an onion to heal. Good luck.

356$Condition: Depression$3/28/2012 6:48:15 PM$Reviewer: Przacsucks, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $1$1$1$I wouldn´t touch this stuff with a ten foot pole if I had to do it over again.  I wouldn´t wish this stuff on my worst enemy.  At first it made me feel good but that didn´t last after about four years I was nervous all the time, witdrawn and began to have severe anxiety.  I have tried to stop many times but am so adicted to the drug that I have to take some form of S.S.R.I.  Prozac completely ruined my life.  I use to be able to function.  I use to have confidence in myself and be fairly normal.  Now I question everything.  My advice is don´t touch this stuff.  It is psychologically addictive and physically addictive and if you ever decide you want to get off it can be too late as it has made your anxiety go through the roof, your depression worsen, and you are now completely physically addicted.  Taking drugs to cope with life is not natural and just because a doctor perscribes it and they say it is meant to treat a certain condition doesn´t mean you are not taking a drug and falling into the escapism and perils of taking any other drug.  Once cocaine was considered the miracle drug until it became clear what it did to people.  I think Doctors who perscribe anti depressants are incompetant and I think the pharmaseutical industry is a billion dollar industry focused on making billions no matter what the human cost.  I hate Prozac and know that is is very bad news.  Don´t even think of taking anti depressants.

Every time I noticed a correlation between the depression and anxiety and the changing seasons and also noticed the symptoms started the day of ovulation and ceased the day menstruation began. These are concerns I discussed with my doctor and each time I was ignored and these ""coincidences"" were brushed off. Each time I was diagnosed I was given a prescription for an anti depressant without discussion of alternatives. On my most recent visit two months ago I was prescribed Prozac and took it out of desperation for about a month and a half with no results. I was still having horrible premenstrual depression. After doing research on PMS and depression I realized my symptoms may be due to low progesterone levels. After reading a few books I started using natural progesterone cream from the day of ovulation until menses and got relief from my symptoms immediately. If you are a woman who suffers from depression PLEASE do yourself a favor and read books by Dr. John Lee, including ""Hormone Balance Made Simple"", & ""What Your Dr. May Not Tell You About Premenopause"". It will change your life and help you return to your natural happy self. I also suggest reading into alternative treatments for depression such as 5HTP & Sam-e, which are two supplements that are as effective if not more so than pharmaceutical anti depressant medication. Please read WebMD reviews on 5HTP from the link below, it will give those of you with mild to severe depression hope http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredi entreview-794-5-HTP.aspx?drugid=794&drugname= 5-HTP&pageIndex=8&sortby=3&conditionF ilter=-500"

I was diagnosed with depression in 2008 and recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the winter of 2011. I have struggled with depression and finding the right medications for close to 4 years and I can honestly say that I feel a difference. Since taking the medication, I feel like I can get out of bed, am not overwhelmed by life, overtly depressed, and don't feel dead inside anymore. I don't know if I'm experiencing a hypomania, but I feel amazing. Even if it is hypomania, it feels a lot better than severe depression.  I would highly recommend this medication to everyone for depression. I don't know if the other medications I'm on have a hand in me feel better, but I'm also taking a anti-psychotic as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder.

I have been taking this medicine since july 6th 2011. This medicine has helped me so much along with cognative behavioral therapy. I would recommend this medicine to EVERYONE. I still have somedays were I relapse a bit, but NEVER like I used to before. I am confinent in saying that Prozac saved my life. If I would have never have taken it, I might not be here today. At only 14, this was very stressful, and still is. Taking this medicine is the easiest thing you'll ever do. My side effects were, sleepy about 4 hours after taking it (I take it in the morning with breakfast), being wide awake at night, and feeling nausous sometimes. But these symptoms went away after about 3 weeks. I, my mom, and my doctor decided that the 10 mg I was taking was not enough, so we uped it to 20mg. I only had reoccuring side effects for about 3 days after changing the dose. If you are reading this, I seriously think you should talk to your doctor about Prozac, it saved me life, and can save yours too. I hope this review was helpful! Best of luck to you! <3

With all I had side effects. I am very sensitive to medications. On prozac just under a month. I have only had the side effect of tiredness.Do not judge a medication or read to much into others. You are likely to have things happen because you read about it. The mind is our most powerful tool. Remembering even Asprin has side effects. I am on 20mg a day in the am, and Xanax .25mg 2 X a day. This is good for me. I know many who have had success with some of the drugs I couldn't use. Don't give up you will find the one too. Also there are some people who will bash a medication 50+ times, as someone has done for Prozac. One more thing I find no difference from brand to generic, possible another mind issue for others.

Okay, it's not a cure, I still have anxiety and symptoms of depression. But after about a month of taking Prozac (and hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety) I have the urge to get off my lazy you know what and actually do something instead of sleeping every day away. I still feel sad a lot, I still have suicidal thoughts (no intentions though), and I still suffer from my generalized anxiety disorder. But on a scale of 1-10 10 being the worst, I was a 10. This has brought it down to a 6. I took Prozac before and it didn't seem to do much so then I switched to Effexor 75mg per day, then I switched to 50mg of Zoloft, then I went to a combo of 20mg of Lexapro and 150mg of Wellbutrin. I wanted to try Prozac again and instead of starting at 10mg for the first week then going to 20, I started at 20 and went to 40. Effexor, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin were prescribed from a psychiatrist as well was the first run with Prozac. So after 2 months being off the Lexapro and Wellbutrin combo, I talked to my regular doctor and she gladly prescribed Prozac and just increased the dose. It's ridiculous how the psychiatrist had my brain switching from med to med when all I needed was a simple increase in my Prozac. And another thing, you hear so much negative, but there is positive to Prozac. For some it can destroy a family, and for others it may rebuild one.

However, I still had them regardless. So, we bumped up Prozac to 30 mg, added on Klonopin (0-2 mg) as needed for days I feel keyed up. I tried the combo of Adderall XR, Prozac, and Klonopin. It worked great. I still have the occasional breakthrough panic attack but she prescribed 0-2 mg Xanax depending on severity.

Overall the combo for ADHD, anxiety, and panic disorder has worked well. Plus tablet splitting saves money with the Xanax and Klonopin.

**NOTE: A work on Xanax and Klonopin, I do NOT take these every single day. Xanax is for the panic that breaks through suddenly and I usually take 1 mg. The Klonopin is if I am feeling a bit too ""keyed-up"" or anxious in the morning, noon, or evening. Klonopin comes on more subtlety than Xanax, which is like a wipe-out of total panic.

This combination works great!"

413$Condition: Depression$11/23/2011 1:26:39 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$"This medication has been life-changing for me. I am currently taking 40mg. It was prescribed for my anxiety, depression, and obsessive thoughts. It took me awhile to figure out that I needed to take the Brand name because I got bad side effects/less effective when I switched to Generic, but now I've been back on the brand name and its a dramatic difference. My depression is so much better and I feel like a cloud has lifted. Everything is pretty much better, but I still have my ups and downs. No pill is a ""miracle."" I may need to up my dose when I see my psychiatrist next week because I've recently been having a more difficult time coping w/my life. However, overall, this med is a great choice for me. Only side effects: stomach discomfort/indigestion intermittently, and hyperactivity (but that is much preferred to my anxiety & depression). Thank you Prozac! I do believe antidepressants are overprescribed, but for me it is a necessity. I've learned the hard way that I decompensate without an antidepressant. Prozac is the one that has really worked for me. Oh, and in case you are wondering, it actually has NOT badly impacted my sex drive! I am still very much active w/my fiance;) So SSRIs don't always have a bad effect on your libido. Give it a try! It may work for you!"

First two days i had no side effects then on the 3rd day i started to feel extremely anxious. Dr gave me ativan 1mg every 4-6 hours to help with the anxiety. that helped. dr said that a side effect of prozac is anxiety and that it would eventually go away once the body is used to the medication. i cannot wait until that happens. i do notice that when i take prozac i get drowsy, probably going to switch to taking at night. also, i am having light sensitivity problems.

Previously I took Zoloft, which made my associated depression significantly worse. This medicine does a great job of reducing obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges. I would say overall that my OCD is at about 25% of the untreated (freaking out constantly) level. Even when I am faced with obsessions or anxiety, they are much easier to deal with. Overall, I would say that it doesn't have some of the typical anti-depressant side-effects, like weight gain, sleepiness, or emotional indifference. There are some side-effects, however. At 60 mg it can cause hyperactivity and sleep disturbances, like waking up at inconvenient times and very vivid dreams. For these reasons, I am thinking about going back down to 40 mg later.

460$Condition: Depression$8/5/2011 12:28:29 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"First, I would like to say that it is crucial to find the right medicine for you by working with a doctor you trust. Prozac works for me, but may not work for you. Don't give up, and most importantly, don't wait to get help. Make an appointment as soon as you have questions or concerns about your mind and/or body.

For me, personally, Prozac has been great. I suffered from depression during most of my twenties, but was resistant to taking medicine. I was worried about side effects. I tried Zoloft, which did not work for me - made me jittery (which might have been the dosage, or just the med). I've also taken ADD meds for ADD and had symptoms of paranoia with the two that I tried on separate occasions. I find that the Prozac helps a little with ADD. I've come to just accept my ADD also - I felt like a different person when I was medicated for it.

Prozac has helped my depression significantly. I don't have major side effects. I have had weight gain, but I don't know if I can blame the medicine. It is harder to achieve an orgasm (I'm a woman) but I can still get there. The sexual side effects have been frustrating sometimes, but I wouldn't trade the feelings of well being I have when I take my 20 mg day as prescribed(I went off of it once cold turkey and the depression came back).

Again, hang in there, best wishes, and find a doctor who listens to you and is knowledgeable in their field.

Have been on it fofr 2 years now.  It absolutely works for PMDD & I have been symptom free for 2 years.  When I first started for the 1st two weeks I had an unusually high amount of energy & was extremely happy.  Then things went back to normal with out the PMDD.  I once went through a small depression with a personal relationship & asked my doctor to higher it from the minimal dose of 20 mil.  He upped it to 40 mil & after a few weeks I kept feeling weird all the time with 'zaps'.  If you don't know what zaps are it's hard to explain- but it feels like your brain is being electrified by tiny little electrical circuits & is really annoying & a little painful but most of all distracting to everyday functions & life.  So I went back down to my 20 mil & have been there ever since.  I can honestly say that it changed my life because PMDD no longer controls my emotions and life- I do.  I still have emotions like every one else, a sex drive, orgasms, happiness & sadness.  I just don't have PMDD what so ever anymore & that alone has changed & saved my life!  I strongly recommend for PMDD!

Her sleep patterns were erratic. Her mental status started getting so bad to the point where she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 3 weeks in may-june. I would not recommend this medication for teens. Everyone's body responds differently to prozac and she is no longer going to take this medication. Her psychiatrist put her on a couple of mood stab. and one antipsychotic. She is more calm now, and the doc plans to when her off to a lower dose of all the meds.

I've been on it for about a year not. It isn't my miracle drug, but it does help more than than the other newer, fancier, way more expensive drugs. Remember, newer isn't always better.

On day seven I began to have severe hot flashes that lasted almost all day and night.  I was unable to get any sleep.  I went to an OB/GYN thinking I was in menopause, but she checked my hormone levels and said I was not, it was the Prozac!  I tried to get off of it and my Dr. was out of town so the doctors on call, told me to reduce the dose, skip days etc. Nothing helped.  When my Dr. returned, I promptly had her switch me to Zoloft.  Why would I want to go through menopause twice?

None are perfect, all have something good and bad, some worse or better than others.  Just have to be patient and try till you find one that works.  Have to stay on them long enough to work.

I will be switching over to 20mg of Prozac within the next week. I have been taking 20-40mg of Celexa for 7 months for severe generalized anxiety disorder. The Celexa worked wonders for me as far as curing my physical and mental anxiety symptoms. The only reason I am switching is because Celexa caused me to gain 35lbs. My doctor told me that it was very unusual and excessive weight gain considering I exercise 6-7 days a week and consume less than 1600 calories a day. My doctor hopes that this drug will work for my anxiety and also aid me to lose 20-25lbs. I would really like to know if anyone thinks this will work for me...???

Went to my shrink and was put on prozac. Within 3 days of starting I was feeling level. All thoughts of suicide were gone and I felt more energetic. Can't thank the makers of this drug enough. Doctors say prozac works very rapidly with bipolar disorder. It sure did for me.
My doctor said that the depression was an easily treatable condition. Coming from the depths of despair it was hard to believe, but the little ray of hope was something to hold on to. If you're reading this you are curious about prozac or are already taking it. Whatever you do, just keep on your meds and don't miss a dose. Either this is going to work for you or you'll have to try another med. There is hope, your brain chemistry is just a little off...but manageable on the right meds.
People have also suggested group therepy so that you can discuss you disease with like
minded people. You might even find some new friends. GOOD LUCK, HANG IN THERE, AND TRUST IN YOUR HIGHER POWER. LOTS  OF LOVE."

For the 1st time in 17 years I feel happy and don't want to die any more. However I still have the tremor. I am not suggesting people stop taking prozac just that they are monitored while on the drug, it is a very good drug for some people but not so great for others like most medication. Don't think that just because you have been on it for a long time you will not be affected by the side effects. Have your Dr monitor you on a regular basis.

599$Condition: Depression$10/11/2010 8:48:44 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$5$"10.5 yrs ago I was told by MotheRisk at Sick Kids in Toronto that this was safe to take during pregnancy. When my son was born he suffered from seizures, frequent (unexplained) crying episodes & has respiratory issues. I discovered 2-3 yrs later that it was NOT recommended to use during pregnancy & that what my son experienced was withdrawal symptoms. It only worked for a period of just over a year & then I developed side effects of increased irritability & it was not longer effective at treating my depression. If I could go back & try something else, I would. I am now on something different that works much better.

If you are planning on having a baby, I would NOT recommend this anti-depressant if it can be helped. (depression, especially during/afer pregnancy is not to be ignored & can be extremely serious .. in some cases, the benefits outweigh the risks, so the decision of which medication to take can only be decided by you & your dr)"

I was being treated for panic attachs, insominia, anxiety, along with depression. Prozac worked fast for me and I would feel happy for hours afterwards. This enabled me to get things done that would take me forever. I became the energizer bunny, unfortunatly when I changed medical insurance my new doctor told me that Prozac was an old drug and would only give me Wellbutrin after that. Now I am back to being in the middle, no ups or downs now. But I still have problems with anxiety and sleeplessness.

Finally, at age 40, I gave up trying to ""be macho"" about it and went to see a psychiatrist.  This was very difficult for me because I always related ""psychiatrist"" with ""inability to cope"" and I've always prided myself on being able to deal with anything (even managing my panic attacks for 30+ years).  The reality is, I wasn't really dealing with panic as much as I would just avoid putting myself in situations that might cause panic.  (Those of us that suffer from general panic disorder know that's not easy--sometimes it comes out of nowhere!)  I finally got sick and tired of always having ""will this cause a panic attack?"" in the back of my mind.  I've been on 20mg for three years now.  WOW!  What a difference!  It absolutely has changed my life!  It's so nice to feel normal (i.e. ""panic free"") even in stressful situations.  I'm so thankful for this drug!  I'm just mad that I spent many years equating ""seeking help"" with ""weakness"" or ""going crazy/can't deal with things"".  I'm perfectly sane and rational--my body just chemically did strange things.  Not anymore!  Prozac made a world of difference for me."

Had a strong craving for sweets, I practically only ate Twizzlers, and lost a significant amount of weight. I had no more racing thoughts, I was reasonable and clear-headed, etc. But after about a year and a half, the honeymoon ended and I guess my body got used to it and all of a sudden all of my old symptoms came back, EXCEPT for my binge eating. If Prozac did one thing it stopped my Bulimia altogether. Prozac was great for me, while it lasted.

I was living in an extremely abusive environment with my mom and i honestly believe that if it hadn't been for this medication, I would have given up on life. The good thing is this medicine made me not be able to really ""feel"" my emotions. This was great for when I was sad. People could yell at me and it wouldnt even phase me. On the other hand it also 'numbed' out the good in life so I could never really ENJOY a fun/great moment. It was almost like I was a robot. It also messes with your sex life. It makes it very difficult to get in the mood. This medicine has been around a long time so all the side effects are known which was great. If I had to take this again, I would."

I have tried most of the others with very bad reactions. The most well known antidepressants caused severe mood swings, weight gain, loss of sex drive, loss of hair, fatigue, anxiousnes...I could go on. The prozac really helped level me out. I finally feel like me again. My skin doesnt crawl. I have more energy. I get out of bed with a spring in my step. I have started excercising again. And my sex life has made a dramatic improvement. Overall, this is the one for me.

now I'm going for a 4th time.  The drugs helps me quite a bit, but the side effects become the next problem.  It takes about 6 weeks to work and I need to go up to 40mgs. As you feel better you focus on the negative effects of the drug.  The better mood you take for granted.  For me the sexual side effect cause me great fustration and then I just can't sleep.  This time around I'm gong to take just 20mgs with remeron and see how that goes. Oh, and don't give up on God.  Be well.  "

Still taking Wellbutrin w/Prozac. Have experienced extremely stressful events in last year.  Found myself sleeping away the day, not wanted to do anything. Had to force myself to do the basics each day.  Unable to work due to all this emotional trauma.  The side effects I have are: extreme nasuated, more depressed and more anxious.  I have lost 10 lbs in 2 wks. because I have no appetite. (only positive, though not healthy) Started today with horrible acid reflux and pain in my stomach. Should have contacted my Dr. today, but figured I would give it a few more days--don't think this is the one for me.  Unable to do anything and really don't care about anything.

It stopped working so I weaned myself off of it.  In about 6 months I became VERY ill...Constant panic..felt like my adrenaline was constantly going through my body...couldn't sleep..afraid, could not eat, lost 40 pounds in a period of 3 weeks.  Went back to Dr. and she put me on Generic Prozac tablets. It took me awhile to increase to 20 mg because I have a ""pill phobia"", which goes along with my panic/depression symptoms.  It took at least 6-8 weeks to start feeling at least to 75% better.  I have noticed I feel tired more now and my sex drive is good, but it is difficult to orgasm.  I will never go off of this medication again, because I truly feel that if I had not started back on it I would have died...I could not eat at all or sleep.     I have never been so sick in my life and afraid.  I was offered other medications to try but I will stick with the Prozac.  Keep in mind that it may not work the same with all people, my dad and my sister can not take it.  It made them worse because they were bipolar.  "

Went thru 1 yr. w/ a terrible Dr. I was completely disabled. Most days I could only lay in bed and sob uncontrolably. I slept about 16 hrs a day. Felt worthless, guilty, hopeless. Thought about suicide alot. Cut myself frequently. Had social anxiety. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Had trouble making even the smallest decisions. Got confused easily. Had anxiety for no reason. Didn't bathe, brush my teeth, or get dressed every day. Stopped going food shopping, did nothing. Had to force myself to do even the smallest tasks. Lost my job over all this. Finally, my husband made me go to a new Dr. and she put me on Prozac. It took about 6 to 8 wks to work for me. Once it did I started feeling better. Eventually I got up to 80mg per day. Then I felt like I was at about 80%, which was great compared to the way I had felt. Had to go off the prozac b/c my husband wanted a baby. I'm in my 7th month now n I'm kind of ok. I'm coping. Can't wait to get back on the prozac though.

Before starting the med, I was suicidal at times, but became more suicidal once I started Prozac.  It made me think more clearly about my plan to kill myself.  If my husband had not intervened and called the cops, I would have killed myself.  I was not myself - angry, swearing, and insisting the world would be better without me.  Luckily, I was hospitalized before I could harm myself and am now on Pristiq.

Prior to taking the med, I had severe hot flashes daily, and at night, the sweats, keeping me awake. I was tired all the time as a result. Could only wear sleeveless tops to school (teacher). Suffered with these premenopausal symptoms for nearly two years before asking for help. DR could not prescribe hormone therapy due to family history of heart disease. She asked if I would like to try this med, and I was ready to try anything at that point! I was only 54 years old, feeling like 65. Took a couple of weeks, but noticed reduced hot flashes immediately. No more sweats at night. Sleeping better as a result. Hot flashes occur, but not as frequent nor as intense. Much more manageable. I can even wear a sweater from time to time! I'd recommend this drug to any woman experiencing premenopausal hot flashes. Don't know how it works, but it does! Energy level increased! Feel like a 35 year old instead of a 56 year old now!!

Isn't helping the depression or anxiety plus I'm laughing hysterically one min. and very angry the next for no reason.  Anger isn't my normal personality.  My whole body feels strange like it's somewhere else & my head & face feel like slight electrical charges with a swishing sound, which is driving me crazy.  I've been on Zoloft, Paxil, strattera, buspirone & visteral, none have worked & most made me feel worse, not to mention soooooo tired all the time.  Can't they come up with something that actually works right?  Oh yeah, can't seem to stop eating either & I'm already way overweight, not good for my health, that's for sure.

I was crying all the time and I could not stop. Prozac helped me stop crying and I could actually feel the difference in my brain. When the dose was increased I noticed that my senses where hightened and then I started to have funny thoughts that I have never had before. I wanted to cut myself and I was thinking of a way to kill myself and I was actually making plans. I wanted to hang myself and then I thought of bleeding myself out. I caught that in time and just in time. I was taken of the Prozac immediately and unfortunately that drug did work for the depression. I wonder if the dose had not been increased would that have been a safe drug for me. I do not think that I would be willing to take that risk.

I wake up sometimes at 3am and can't fall back asleep but I'm too tired to get up.  I'm tired all the time it seems, which is odd because this is the best shape I've been in for years (I go to the gym 5 times a week and love it - except for not going recently because of prozac).  So I hate this drug with a passion. It's been horrible and I just pray these side effects stop soon!

801$Condition: Depression$2/19/2010 11:56:40 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$This medication takes at least a month to take full effect. The first week I would wake up with nausea during the night. By the second week, I felt numb to most emotions. Both of these symptoms suck, but they go away. Without this medication, I don't think I would be able to function. It really worked for me while I was on it for about 7 months, I came off of it for a couple months, and the depression and anxiety came back, so I'm going back on it. The medication alone will most likely not cure anything, as I have learned, but combined with counseling, I'm hoping to heal myself.

On 20mg daily, generic and my OCD symptoms are almost non- existent anymore.  I also no longer long live each day with the anxiety from repetitive thoughts worrying about mistakes I've made, what I said, etc.  No problems with my sex drive, I sleep well (because I'm not always worrying or doing 'routines') and I have actually lost weight.  It's like I have more control over real life and not the pretend life I was leading.  I also attend therapy with a psychologist.  The combination of Prozac and therapy is working really well for me.

I was very skeptical that Prozac could help me. After 2 weeks, I began to notice a difference. I've now been on it for 2 months and I now have my life back!!!!!

Prescribed to my wife after her mothers death she started to get more distant and now we are separated and everything seems fine to her, I would say emotionless now. She says she is very happy to be by herself, family and friends are shocked as I. As I learned about the drug on my own I find she has been having severe reactions. I wrote the prescribing doctor a letter outlining the problems and they are going to at least taking her off this drug. Her bizarre behaviour I thought was just me but now find other family members wondering what is wrong with her. My only goal now is to get her off this stuff and in time, maybe, just maybe we can save our marriage. I do not want this woman back but maybe in time my wife will return.Please beware if you or any family members are on or starting this drug. Understand the possible severe side effects that go along with it.

All was ok until they uppped th 20mg to 40mg. I am also on Dextroamphetamine 10mg ER 3x daily, and Alprazolam 2 mg 3x daily.
When on the 40mg Prozac, combined with the others, I was unable to do much and stare at a Monitor. Xanax and Prozac cancelled the Dexedrine (even at 15mg ER). I am currently taking generic Prozac 20mg (one daily), generic Dexedrine 10mg ER (3x daily), and generic Xanax (No more than 1.25 mg 2-3x daily)and it has made a WORLD of diffrence. I am focused, anxiety well under control, barely notice Prozac, and the Dexedrine is for ADHD, and also fits this mix well at the 10mg ER dose rather than the 15mg dose. I feel alive, aware, normal, active and can focus. Be careful about taking ANY of these in high doses! I plan on weaning to lower dosage on all 3 within 2 months. My aim is to be chemical free sometime next year, or the BARE MINIMUM of what I need. I managed 45 years without Prozac or Dex, and have moved up the ranks in almost all jobs I had. The brain adapts, and should not be a chem lab for psychiatrists! Raed adverse reactions or discuss with your doctor before taking ONE Prozac! Hope this helps."

It works effectively for my depression with a minimum of side effects. My ususal dose was 20mg, which I would take either day or night.

I hate the idea of having to possibly switch to something else.

My sex drive did return, the weight did not.  I do notice that my response to alcohol has changed since taking prozac.  I blackout from drinking very easily and feel worse mentally after drinking.  The doctor said that is common because prozac and alcohol work against each other.  Prozac is the best drug I have ever taken.  My dose was increased to 40mg this summer.

I did have some insomnia, but not a big deal. Didn't really effect my sex drive which is a huge plus. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it because for some reason I was breaking out with a red rash all over my face. It looked like first to second degree burns. Really weird. And I'm one that can't be away from the sun, I love it too much. So forget that. When I stopped taking it, my face healed fine.

But the generic's don't seem to work for me or thats the way I see it. One generic by a certain manufacturer seems to work fairly well but I get mixed up if it is working or not. Of course the prices between the main brand and generic's is quite a bit. Has anyone else had this problem?? Thanks.

I had terrible yawning episodes and felt tired (and literally would blackout for 10 minutes at a stretch while I was in class) all of the time. I could barely read a page without falling asleep and would forget what I read within five minutes.  Do not take if you have vision problems  as it causes them to get worse!  In short.....taking this drug can be disasterous for a college student!
967$Condition: Depression$8/30/2009 10:01:17 PM$Reviewer: Spot, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$Prozac worked for me, the first time I tried it, in only a few days. I stopped crying 24/7,& realized how I had abandoned housekeeping & personal hygeine totally. If I'm I miss taking my Prozac on schedule and under under severe stress, I still have some suicidal thougts, but NO actual plans or preparations for suicide, which I've done with other medications. The important thing for me is to remember to take the Prozac in the morning because it does lift my mood & if I take it at night, I don't sleep at all. You must NOT exceed your doctor's prescribed dosage or instructions for any reason. Make a chart or use a calendar & mark off each day after, not before, you take your Prozac. Don't be shy about telling your doctor everything you feel or think while you're taking Prozac. He can't regulate your dosage properly or know if it's the right medication for you, or if you need tests...if you don't give him the full facts and the truth. Besides Prozac, find someone, anyone, to tell your problems to. Don't hide from the world and think things will magically get better. They won't. Been there, tried that. Good luck to you. Spot

I noticed that many things that used to make me crazy no longer do so or not as much as they used to. However, in the past week I've noticed that I am unable to reach orgasm and climax and am also completely uninterested in having sex nor do I miss it. I do NOT want to be this way and it's causing me a lot of frustration. I don't know what to do. I don't want to stop taking the Prozac, NOR do I never want to have sex again or feel arousal, etc.

When I first started taking Prozac and had fantastic results --- depression symptoms decreased, no more suicidal thoughts, could actually get out of bed.  I started out at 20 mg and my doctor eventually increased my dosage to 40 mg.  This dosage worked fine for about two years.  Then I started to have signficant worsening of my depression symptoms.  The doctor then added Elavil in addition to Prozac.  Also tried Pamelor with the Prozac - both worked very well, but fatigue was extreme (and side effects were horrible). I don't mind mild side effects if it means the depression is gone.  I tried Remeron, Wellbutrin, and Celexa before returning to Prozac.  None of these worked as well as Prozac had initially.  I went back to 40 mg Prozac and did well.  My dosage was eventually decreased to 20 mg which I have been on for about 8 years.  My depression symptoms have been well-controlled with this ""maintenance dose"".  I have been having more symptoms the past few months.  My doctor wants me to try Pristiq (which I will start tomorrow).  Overall, Prozac worked wonders when is was working.  I definitely developed a tolerance to this medication over time.  Side effects were pretty mild.  I definitely sweat more than most people and I have experienced some sexual side effects.  Overall, this drug saved my life but lost its effectiveness over time.  I wish it still worked as well for me as it did initially.  Definitely worth a try.    "

1012$Condition: Depression$8/2/2009 4:43:50 PM$Reviewer: six, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed 10mg once a day at my appointment last week, the same does I was on when I took several years ago. Doctors seem to find this the treatment of choice for those of us who suffer from chronic pain. Chronic pain is enough to trigger severe depression in anyone. I planed to go out this weekend and have a few drinks because you can’t mix Prozac or the other medication I need to take for pain with alcohol, alcohol is a depressant so that’s done and my plan was to start Prozac on Monday but I took my first does at 2:30 a.m., Sunday because I can’t sleep (anxiety) I would like to go to bed. Prozac will make you sleepy; once your body is fully adjusted that sleepy feeling will pass. Take it at the same time every day; if the sleepy feeling is a problem take it at night before bed. I’m taking my second dose at 8:00 p.m. tonight so I can sleep and I will stay on that schedule. I don’t know why some people report weight gain and others loss, I think it’s the difference in how depression effects different people. In my case I warned my friends and family that I was starting this medication and that I will drop about 10 lbs in the first month. That’s what happened the first time I took it; I didn’t want anyone to worry. I am already small and it’ll be quite noticeable. I never had side effects before but still told my friends and family what could happen. I have a great support system and they will watch me closely for red flag side effects while I get adjusted. Prozac takes a few weeks before the full effects are felt even if you start feeling the benefits right away. If you can’t stay on this medication for the first month then you haven’t given it a chance. If you are having problems, talk with your doctor, they may need to adjust the dosage; if you can’t talk with your doctor about your concerns then you have the wrong doctor, find one you can talk to. And what ever you do don’t just stop taking it; you have to wean yourself off of it. I’ll be back in a month

I have found relief from the Panic attacks, but I believe that I am experiencing severe reactions to the increased dosage such as, muscle twitching, nausea, tiredness, inability to sleep, and tremors. I am in the process of seeing a neurologist to make sure that there is nothing else going on and if not then I will have to try a different medicene. Not having the attacks anymore has been great but the side effects are miserable. I recommend to try a diffrent medication before trying Prozac, it may save you alot of trouble and money!
1019$Condition: Depression$7/29/2009 1:40:35 AM$Reviewer: lt999, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$4$I was suicidal and depressed, and this did nothing but take away my energy to do any harm to myself. In fact, I was still depressed, and gained 35 pounds. I was in a terrible fog, and felt even more depressed, just less motivated. I felt like a tranquilized animal. Which now, years later I discovered the doctor had medicated me very wrongly, and treated me falsely all along. He did not answer my questions about the drug and would just increase the dosage when I begged for answers. I left his 'care' after 3 years of being prescribed a crap drug. Thank God for second opinions, otherwise I would have been stuck in depression longer. She adjusted my care. I don't know if THAT is effective in a review, but I will report that any extreme exercise regiment or diet I was put on did nothing. Prozac keeps the 35 lbs. of extra weight on you until you are weaned off of it. Then, like magic I lost all that weight.

1037$Condition: Depression$7/12/2009 11:04:15 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$After losing my job in 2007 I started showing signs of depression. Even after finding a new job the low feelings continued. After speaking with my doctor he suggested a 20 mg daily dose of Prozac. Since my insurance only covers generic prescriptions I was put on a generic Prozac. Before starting the scripts I read some of the reviews of different anti-depressants and was a little hesitant to try them. I've been on this for about a month now and couldn't be happier. Little things no longer upset me, I have more energy and am actually happy to wake up in the mornings just to get things done, no more sleeping until noon. The only thing that worries me is the fact that nothing really upsets me anymore, and that can be good and bad. Another thing is my sex drive is the same but it takes a lot longer for me to have an orgasm, which my girlfriend loves. So I guess it's good all around, happy woman=happy me!

He correctly diagnosed me with Chronic General Anxiety Disorder w/ Depression. He put me on 1mg of Klonopin 3x's a day and 20mg of Prozac in the morning. I can't say I am 100%..but I feel better than I have ever felt before. The prozac instantly took that blah feeling away and the suicidal thoughts. I do have more energy now due to the prozac as well. The Klonopin helps to ease my anxiety and makes me a little drowsy..but I will take drowsy over anxiety any day..lol I have just started these meds a week ago.

For the first time in over 40 years I have been able to live without the emotional turmoil I endured on a monthly and more recently daily basis. Anyway, so far it works for me. The only side effects I have experienced are nausea, problems sleeping and having very weird dreams during the first week of use.

Started at 20mg and am still there couple of months later.  Effective for me; the fatigue is lessened but I am not sure whether other factors are involved w/that. Side effects are an occasional unexplained red itchy rash on my right forearm (goes away), and VERY VIVID dreams, not always nightmares but a LOT of recurrent dreams.  But I always had vivid dreaming anyway. Celexa had deadened my dreams so maybe they have just come back. Overall I am satisfied so far; oh, the PMDD is virtually gone and that is why my dr. originally Rx'd me antidepressants! I would actually think (in an abstract way) of ending my life during the depths of some of the months w/PMDD.  It DOES affect your sex drive like they say though, and when I see my dr. again I am going to mention this first off b/c it really bothers me the lack of desire I have now.

Prozac did help my depression for the most part. It also made me become angry more easily about things than normal.

That was a good switch for me, I have been on that for over six months now. I do like to share medication stories, and offer advice to others where I can. I am a big believer in herbal remedies.

I had a smile on my face constantly but want to kill everyone who spoke to me. I became very homicidle and forgot about how depressed I was. I took it for about 6 weeks and then tried to overdose on over 600mg of it along with a bottle of tylenol and a bottle of nodoz. This may work for others, but it did not work for me. Be careful!

I have been on it for almost 17yrs only stopping (with Dr.s direction) during my 2 pregnancies and quickly starting back on them after their births. Both of my kids are beautiful,smart and healthy.(TIPS) Do not stop taking the med abruptly, try not to miss doses/or take more than prescribed, and inform your Dr. if you have any unusual side effects...I have had only positive experiences with Prozac by following the direction by my Dr. and on the bottle...but I will add...over the 17yrs I have broke one of the ""No's"" and had alcoholic beverages on occasion without experiencing any side effects (but every one's body is different) I have not had any of the sexual dysfunctions reported with SSRI's either. I hope this helps.

1142$Condition: Depression following Delivery of Baby$4/10/2009 1:02:06 AM$Reviewer: Hope, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Prozac saved my life. Really. The postpartum depression 17 years ago never lifted. I was on 20-40 mg for nine years from 1992 to 2001. I could function minimally but I was so grateful for that. I could at least go to work and do a few things around the house. Before I couldn't even get out of bed, or take care of myself. It eventually stopped working, but nothing since that has even come close. I was not completely without any depression--people have to understand that no drug in the world will alleviate all depression--but I was able to go on living. It was a struggle and still is a struggle everyday, but this drug worked the best. It's now 8 years later, I've tried every med/combo, some would not work at all or maybe work for a year or two. I tried Prozac again during those years but it was not effective. Finally last year I was diagnosed correctly with bipolar 1. The only other drug which has kept me alive has been the patch Emsam. I have been hospitalized 3 times and in desperation finally agreed to ECT last fall. Even that only relieved the depression a bit for only 2 months. I am grateful the Prozac worked as long as it did. I never had any of the side effects listed (not even the sexual ones.) It also helped greatly with anxiety. No other med has relieved the anxiety as well. I hope you find something that works for you...I will try, try, try again! Never give up!

Risperdal worked well short term but gave him dystonia and so was discontinued. The Prozac gave him his life back and he is functioning pretty well on 40 mg/day. His anxiety is presently increasing and we're investigating supplementing with another med...maybe Abilify but it looks as scary as the Risperdal.

Later, I was going through a very rough patch and began using Nortriptyline with the intent to use Prozac along with it for my fibromyalgia and migraines. Side effects(heart palpitations) caused me to discontinue the Nortriptyline before starting the Prozac. Then I tried Doxepin. Great stuff for depression and anxiety, but causes lots of sleepiness and heart palpitations. I was finally ready to start the Prozac 10mg. It has been 6 months now and I have had very good results. I am still on the same dose with very few side effects.I take only the Prozac now, since the Doxepin had many undesirable effects on me.I am sleepy at times and my appetite is good, but no weight gain like with the Doxepin. No sexual problems either like the latter drug gave me. I will be increasing to 20 mg soon. My only problem is that I am scared to take my migraine meds(Imitrex) due to sertonin syndrome.

I ended up blurting out every thought I had, to the point where it was embarrassing. Looking back, I think my dosage was way too high. I've been on a dozen different SSRIs, and Lexapro is the best, but you do build up an immunity over time, so combining with another drug like Wellbutrin provides a good balance (plus, it helps with the sexual side effects of all the SSRIs). Low doses of Prozac have helped my friends who suffer from PMS and post-partum depression.

I was always thinking I was having heart atacks or just the overall feeling something was physically wrong with me or I was going to die. My doctor put on 40mg prozac. Made me jittery. He added .5mg xanax time release that helped the jitters. After 6 months I was still having the same thoughts but could calm myself down by breathing techniques which helped me relax. Told my doctor and he bumped me up to 60mg prozac and 1mg xanax time release. I am doing great. I have also discovered that I am more open to people even strangers I talk alot more and not afraid of what people think. I used to be very quiet and not outspoken but that has changed and I love it. I am 51 and seemed to have lost my sex drive. Hard to get an erection (no pun intended). Don't know if it is the drugs or old age.(LOL)

I told my then psychologist who brushed it off.  I wish I had read up on the drug and its side effect (most of which I have personally experienced) My new Dr. is presently weaning me off; it is a difficult and tedious process for me.  I am experiencing daily, lingering headaches as a result and sever mood swings.  Personally, whilst being on Prozac the reasons for doing so did not reduce in any significant/satisfactoral amount to either of us.  My tendency to shop did not decrease which was the main cause did not decrease to any great percentage to my chagrin, I wish it had so at least being on it would be worth coming off it.

I started having flu-like symptoms and realized it was from stopping the Wellbutrin (flu-like symptoms are part of Wellbutrin withdrawal). It lasted about two weeks. Now I'm feeling fine, and the Prozac has helped me immensely. The major side effect, for me, is the inability to have an orgasm.

I am withdrawing from it ASAP! I think that this drug should only be used if EXTREME need be, and even then, only temporarily! It really does give me great grief. Today, I had a panic attack after months of not having any. I guess it totally depends on the person, but as I mentioned before, I am terminating my ""relationship"" with Prozac ASAP!"

Then I started getting major side effects, went thru all medical testing for the symptoms, gastric,suicicidal,weight gain without changing eating habits,self esteem lowered, and concluded it was the Cymbalta! I tried to get off and after 3 days had bad withdrawal symptoms. I am on Prozac 20mg for 2 weeks and lowered my Cymbalta to 30mg. It is definetly better. I don't feel suicidal.

First of all-everyone has different reactions due to their chemical makeup. This medication has to build gradually in your system.You can build a tolerence to it, so you may have to start and stop a few times. It takes at least 3-4 weeks to have an effect. I've have taken this medication for over ten years. I recently tried several others because my migraines were getting worse. I will be going back on this medication because it is wonderful. If you are having any difficulties talk to your doctor right away, and if you are taking multiple medications. Its perfect for some so do not let these reviews scare you. What should scare you is going through issues alone when you should talk to a professional.

The depression and irritability resurfaced. I've been on Prozac for 3 weeks and I think it is causing the mucus/phlem problem that I seen to be experiencing.

I have been taking this med for 3 months. The first day I took it I felt incredible. I was in a great mood and this med also helped with my anger issues.  Prozac did make me sleepy for the first two weeks, but it only made me sleepy when I was not busy doing something else.  About a week into taking my meds I realized I was having incredibly weird dreams, but not normal weird dreams; really off the wall; who dreams this kind of stuff, dreams. My dreams are more vivid and they are so out of this world that I actually remember them enough to be able to tell someone about them in detail! Even the normal nightmarish dreams are not really scary, my dreams are pretty comical! I am in my 3rd month and I don’t really feel a change so my doctor prescribed me 40mg. I was very scared to take this medication for the first time, my doctor told me not to go to WebMd and read the reviews of this drug. As soon as I got home I went to this website, but the reviews proved my doctor right. He told me everyone reacts differently to this medication and to not scare myself into a panic attack. Sometimes it can be hard to find someone who understands what you are going thru unless they are going thru the same thing. I find it comforting to talk to people who have my condition because we are all able to relate to one another and the biggest thing is that we have sympathy for one another and not empathy. Our doctors and psychiatrists can only tell us what to take and listen, but they truly do not know how it feels to have your heart beat so fast that you can actually feel it, or when your body begins to shake uncontrollably; when your throat feels like it is closing up, you just want to get out of your own skin because you truly do not know what to do! This is an awful feeling, and to have someone to tell you to just calm down and breathe makes it even worse because your mind is so powerful it won’t let you. I hope this med works for you, Good Luck!

After taking the medications for approxiametely three weeks now, my uneasiness has gone up slightly.  I definetely reccomend this product, especially because many of the sideeffects listed are not prevalent in ,y life.

I can be very irritable. The slightest thing can put me in a rage.This has effected my job and relationships.  I've tried all the drugs but Prozac eased the  monster in me. The side effects, rare but I coughed none stop, I  was exhausted -worse in the morning  trying to get up. Due to the exhaustion I stoped going to  the gym and gained 40 lbs. I had itching, but not all the time and that's also a symptom of menopause.  I  was on the gen and stopped because I couldn't take the fatigue any longer. But my anger and mood swings worsened.  So i'm going back on prozac but i'm going to try the real drug, not gen. Doc is going to give me a small sleeping pill see if that helps with waking up all night, hence the exhaustion. I'm going to force myself to hit the gym.  The side effects are not as bad as the rage and mood swings I experience without it.
Hope this helps.

1345$Condition: Depression$11/10/2008 11:50:06 AM$Reviewer: HappyMom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$5$5$5$First of all, for anyone struggling with depression, we have all been told that exercise is also a key element in fighting depression.  When taking Prozac, or any medication for depression, it goes hand in hand with exercise. I have found this drug to be amazing after two short months.  I feel absolutely great, like I never have before, love my life and my children/family and have done a complete life turnaround.  However, for those of you who enjoy a few cocktails, with the holidays approaching, BEWARE!!!! Three glasses of wine used to be nothing for me before the medication, and now after 3-4 drinks, you can have blackout instances without even realizing it.  It is really scary.  Please take control and caution on the alcoholic intake come the holiday season.  It can be very dangerous for those who are new to the drug.....

The first time I was being treated for what they thought was depression, so I was only put on Prozac, which sent me into mania. I guess for that I'm slightly greatful for the drug because it clued my doctor's in to my bi-polar disorder. The second time I actually was taking Prozac with a mood stabalizer, and that time I actually ended up being hospitalized because of the Prozac. Needless to say, I'm not taking it, and won't touch it with a ten foot pole anymore. Even if it made me feel really really good at first.

Both of the other times, I felt edgy and antsy in the beginning, and then the anti-depressant aspect kicked in and I felt pretty good.  This time, I've been on it 4 weeks. It has helped with anxiety, but the depression is still here, and still pretty bad in the mornings.  I've never felt this erratic with it before, so I don't know if this is typical, or maybe related to the fact that I've gone on and off it a few times, or am not up to the dosage I last took or what. But overall, the last two times I felt it was my miracle drug, so I'm going to give it more time this time and hope it works again.

I have been on MANY medications for Treatment Refractory Depression and, this has been my life saver. I tried it many years ago, and became very agitated / akathesiastic at only 10 mg., so, when it was suggested to me in replacement of Imipramine during a recent life crises I was hesitant, but figured I had nothing to lose at that point. I am so happy that I did. I have my life back.

I also take 70 mg. of Vyvanse for A.D.D. in the morning, and have noticed that Prozac really helps to even out the stimulant mood variations (I used to take Adderall which made me go up and down alot), and I have noticed that Prozac along with a stimulant makes the stimulant effect noticeably less mood-altering. I feel less ""Up"" from the stimlant, but also don't feel it can bring me as ""down"". To the point where the only difference I can see is that, when the Vyvanse isn't in me, I am just much less organized but my emotional world is not much different. 

I also take Trazadone, 50 mg. per night for bed as Prozac makes me noticeably prone to fatigue during the days and insomnia often. This is a great medication for regulating circadian rythems.

It helped, and I was later able to taper off and then quit. I resumed Prozac during a painful divorce and again got better and felt able to discontinue the drug after a time. Each time I remained off the drug for an extended period, however, my depression reoccured regardless of my current life circumstances. Currently, I have been on Prozac for about three years. I am perimenopausal and believe it is the only thing that keeps me from feeling the severe mood swings that are so common with the hormone fluctuations associated with menopause. I also attribute Prozac with saving my life as it has allowed me to function more normally than when I have not been taking it. There were many times I felt like giving up prior to taking this drug. Now, I can't imagine not living every day to the fullest. This is my experience but I would encourage people who try this drug to stick with it for awhile if the side effects are not too severe. For I believe, it is the long-term effects of the medicine that are so beneficial. I also take a small dosage of Trazadone at night as a sleep aid and take it and the Prozac only before bedtime.

It helped at first.I have been on prozac for several years now. I am now expeiencing mild memory loss, and my mind seems to wander aimlessly. Aftersome research, I discovered prozac contains fluoride, the same stuff as in toothpaste. Fluoride is an extremely toxic poison, which is even added to our drinking water. Fluoride has been proven to cause dementia, and can lead to alzheimers. Prozac is also been known to cause suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I have since stopped taking prozac, but am still feeling the effects of this toxic drug. I would never recommend prozac to anybody I cared about. Research all your medications...thoroughly before you take it. You will be very surprised at some of the ingredients they add to medicine. It is pretty scary stuff!! An informed patient, is a healthier patient!!

Each time hoping for the famous results and instead, each time getting nothing except fatigue, complete loss of libido, weight gain, and only a slight change in mood for the better, on a few non PMDD days; one or two days of my two week PMDD. I have depression and it gets so bad before my period. My weight fluctuates 10-15 lbs before my period. My mood swings are scary. I have cramps for a week. So in a nut shell, I am a nut. In all seriousness, I have depression worsened by PMDD or PMDD worsened by depression. Either way, the Doctors always go back to ""Let's just try adding some Prozac again, one more time."" I think there are two or three days of the month, not during my PMDD time, I think I feel better. However, the rest of the month is not worth it. Tired and sexless? Those are the two best ways to make a married depressed and hormonal mother of two, in her 30's, give up all together! I did see a small difference in cramps too. If it did not wreck my libido, I would stay on it for longer than the three months I usually give it, to see if the effects would increase and perhaps I could see better overall longterm benefits."

I didn't realize how deep into depression I was until the Prozac started working for me.  My mood swings were eliminated, I liked my husband again, and I was happy...which was something I hadn't felt for years!  I really wish I would have been brave enough years before to admit that I needed some help...it saddens me to think of the ""living"" that I lost out on in my youth.  
I took it religiously for the first year, and then developed some sort of itchy body rash.  Two biopsies could not determine the cause.  After 6 months the rash went away.  Near the end of the first year of 20-30mg I was frustrated that I even had to take anything, and felt like it wasn't doing anything for me anymore.  I quit cold turkey with no side effects, but noticed after several months that I was reverting back to my mean self.  Finally, June of this year I got back on at 40mg.  It started helping right away, but now my body is once again consumed with this rash.  My skin constantly feels like it is crawling, and I wake myself at night scratching, that is when I am fortunate enough to fall asleep.  I haven't seen where anyone else has reported this side effect, but I can't trace it to anything but the Prozac.  I haven't taken a pill in 3 days, and the swelling in the bumps is going down, and while there is still an itch, it isn't as extreme as it was.  My doctor is going to switch me to Celexa, which I know nothing about.  If it works the same, but without the itch, it will be a God send!"

I have a history of anorexia, ADD/ADHD, and depression. I was taking adderall when I was taking prozac. I notice that I was getting panic attack everytime I took my medication. At first I thought it was the adderall so I stop taking it for a couple days, nothing change. Then I stop taking the prozac and started taking the adderall again. That's when I notice the panic attacks were coming from the prozac. Everytime I took it within an hour I would start getting paranoid. My doctor and I were surprise. 
1447$Condition: Depression$7/18/2008 1:17:24 PM$Reviewer: sammyed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$4$5$"I took Prozac for many years. After awhile, I got a kind of a tolerance, and I realized when my family doctor described it, I wasn't sufficiently treating my depression--which I have had for over 30 years, because Prozac is just a SSRI and I needed the SSNRI, the neuropinephrine part of treatment. I started to have ""breakthrough symptoms"" of crying and low energy. But it really helped with my premenopausal rough periods, unlike the Effexor I am on (which helps more for depression but not my periods.) Oh, perfection and the quest for it! I am just glad I met Prozac and I read Prozac Nation and all the other literature, Listening to Prozac. We will look back on this time in mental health and realize we had development of a good thing for a true brain illness. I am just grateful to have better meds. Now I need to accept my illness and stay on medication. And I am grateful for sites like this, psychiatric researchers and providers that care, pharm companies that do work on meds because they want to improve care for mentally ill people."

I had many (too many)conditions for which it prescribed...Bulimia, depression,Bipolar and panic attacks. (fun, huh?) I eventually stopped my Bulimia, but that was due to a wonderful treatment center and MUCH needed bathroom supervision. I don't credit Prozac with my 'cure'. Three months ago I was realizing that the Prozac was doing nothing for my depression-actually at a point, I felt as if was making me MORE depressed.  I would yawn all day at work and immediately would pass out on the coach while watching TV...always. Along with the help of my Dr., we decided that Prozac wasn't for me. We decided to switch to (can I say this?) another form of antidression...W&*lb&^rin.
I have my energy back, I don't pass out at 7pm anymore, gone are the days of yawning all day. I am SO glad that I am off of Prozac. "

Even that small amount makes me drowsy, nauseous, dizzy, headaches, and bouts of laziness, so my doc told me to take it every other day until my brain gets used to it.

Now the constant sense of dread and sadness that I lived with for so long is gone, which is just fantastic!!!  I still have to deal with small bouts of depression/anxiety, which I would consider to be at normal levels of every day living.  The only draw back is that I find that I am a little drowsy at times (and I only take 10mg/day), but for the sense of peace that I have, the trade off is worth it!

I dont cry at everything and stupid little things don't get to me anymore. I dont stress out over stupid things like traffic and bills. I even sleep better at night.

Read the reviews and side effects before I started taking the med & they scared me to death! Thought I would @ least give the med a try.  Have had NO adverse side effects.  I go to sleep better @ night & do not take any OTC sleep meds.  (Took OTC sleep meds for @ least 2 yrs or more). Before starting this med, I cried alot over the least little thing and got very anxious during the day especially if there was the least little unsettling news. I also have a Rx for Xanax 1mg, but seldom use it. I have used this before in the past (because of my divorce and a VERY difficult daughter) and liked it, but I am very cautious not to take it unless I think I need it, I do not want to become dependent. My doctor told me that my family & friends would most likely notice a change before I would and he's right!

1489$Condition: Depression$5/20/2008 7:23:39 PM$Reviewer: anonymous, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking 20mg of Fluoxetine about a month and a half ago to try to get a hold of my depression. I have had depression on and off for probably 6-8 years or so (I am now 24). I've tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and another anti-depression medicine, but Fluoxetine seems to be helping me the best. Some of the other medications actually made things worse for me. I have been dealing with a lot of stressful things in my life over the past few years (and even more here recently), but this has definitely helped me tremendously. The only negative side effect I have experienced thus far with Fluoxetine is losing some sexual desire. This was/is a problem for me because my wife and I are currently trying to conceive. I have never had a problem in this department and actually I would say I had more desire when it comes to sex than most others. Just here recently I think I am starting to get back to normal a little bit in that department. I feel like my sexual desire may be coming back to me like it was before getting on this medication. Overall, I really like Fluoxetine and I think it's worth a shot if you are experiencing depression.

I never noticed a dramtic difference in how I felt BUT my family did. They swear it worked wonders. Looking back now it did. I am just starting on it again now. A thing to keep in mind with anti depresants is that it takes time (sometime 6 months) to work. I know I have taken many of them but prozac worked best. I have noticed through my experience and reading up on it that some work well for people but not others, so even though this worked well for me it might not for you.  DON'T expect a miracle from anti depressants they work gradually and you might not know it. Others will notice a difference in you more than you do.

Our life has been a living hell since then. Many Chemo. tratments, hospital stays, a stem cell transplant and nothing has helped. I did some research on the medications my wife was taking prior to the cancer. I went to Eli Lilly's web site and researched the side effects of Prozac. One of the side effects of a high dose is the inflamation of the lympnodes which can lead to Lymphoma cancer. I lowered the dose my wife now takes to 40 MG a day. We can not stop the Prozac now because of this horrible cancer and the depression involved. We are a young retired couple living a life of hell, I feel because of Prozac. Thank you for reading this and remember the most important thing in life is your Health and the Health of the ones you love.

The first 2 weeks were filled with horribly increased anxiety but my doctor had warned me of that possibility and gave me 0.25 mg  Xanax to get me through.  I'm on week 3 and doing much better.  I sometimes wake up in the middle of sleep with an anxiety attack but those moments are decreasing.  The only side effect I'm currently experiencing is the increased heart rate but it isn't enough to cause dizziness or shortness of breath.  The anxiety is getting much better.

I also thought I had anxiety which was severe enough to cause shaking and most of the time just felt like constant static. I've been taking 20 mg generic Prozac for 10 months now and friends & family & I have noticed a very positive difference. For a time, I thought it was becoming less effective but my Psychiatrist suggested a Cognitive Therapy class. The combination of Prozac, 1-on-1 Therapy, group therapy, and the Cognitive Therapy class have each contributed to a significant reduction in my symptoms. I think it is normal to have positive and negative feelings when reacting to normal events in my life and that continues to happen ALTHOUGH the times when I get down about something do not last for extended periods of time like they used to and I don't get as severely depressed as before. I can still feel sadness about things but it's not the unreasonable ""crying for no reason"" that I used to experience. I consider Prozac one of many tools that my Psychiatrist has given me. I feel that it's the combination of the Prozac and the different forms of therapy that have eased my symptoms. Additionally, maintaining my weight and health and energy levels are important to me and none of these have been affected by taking Prozac. Now, instead of feeling depressed or anxious, I feel more positive,  clear-headed, and static-free. "

I love to eat but I have to eat very little to maintain my weight.  My calorie intake is less than 1000 a day.  I treadmill 40 min. at least 3-4 x a week.  I want to be able to eat normally.

After taking Prozac for a week I've never looked back!  All those symptoms are gone and life is great again.  I don't worry constantly, stay in bed under the covers and cry because of depression and I don't obcess or things, like mistakes I've made, or that my kids are grown or tramatic events in my life.  I've lost 30 pounds, have lots of energy and am happy 99% of the time.  I am alive once again instead of struggling to get through everyday, not leaving my house because I was afraid of people, and the only real relief I got was sleeping, when I didn't have terribly traumatic night terrors.  I can't tell you how prozac, the generic, has saved my life.  Suicidal thoughts are gone too.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Thank God for my Doctor!

Not only did it increase my depression and anxiety but,it also created irrational thoughts which seriously made me think and feel - as if I was going crazy, almost if I had totally ""lost it"" mentally. Actually thought about checking myself into the hospital, but feared if they admitted me, they would lock me up and throw away the key. Wow, it's simply frightening how   20 mg of Prozac can make a person think that they are truly going crazy and insane!
I acknowledge that I do struggle with depression, but I also make a conscious effort to keep things in proper perspective. When I contacted my physician, she wanted me to increase my dosage. Obviously, I refused to continue on the same course - I would rather take nothing at all and ""suffer from the blues"", than suffer from extreme irritability,agitation, and irrational thinking. Thank goodness she switched me to Paxil - atleast now, I have no adverse side effects"
1531$Condition: Depression$3/18/2008 8:19:02 PM$Reviewer: $2$1$4$This medicine worked horribly for me. I didn't feel any better and it made me gain tons of weight.

As soon as I started seeing another doctor and switched medications (which I was then told that this medication is mainly used for anxiety which I don't have), I literally droped 10 pounds in 3 days. If you have issues with this medication, trust me there are alternatives out there that work a lot better without the side effects.

Doc says there is nothing that can be done for the sweating.  I just cant believe that.  Does ANYONE have this issue?? or know of anything I can ask my doc about that might be able to help?

With two kids at home and one with ADHD, OCD, ODD, and GAD it was a nightmare.  I didn't think my paxil was working so I made an appt to get on something else.  Turned out they put me on Prozac.  I took it for 4 days and felt like I wanted to vomit and die.  It was worse.  I went back to the dr and said I'd rather up the dose of my paxil then try something new like prozac.  I told them how horrible it made me feel.  They said someone should never just stop and start a new drug within a day like that.  The dose should've been monitored.  Never ever take prozac.

I couldn't tell the difference it made at first but trusted the doctor and I was discharged a week later. I started feeling a ""fake"" sort of happy and didn't realize that I wasn't getting better. I attempted suicide on this drug 3 months after starting it. Being hospitalized again at a different facility they upped the dose. I noticed the same feelings weren't getting better and my doctor didn't understand that it wasn't helping me so I just decided to stop using it.

1709$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/22/2007 5:58:48 AM$Reviewer: lollielox, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$Out of all the 33 different psychiatric meds I have been on, (SSRI'S,mood stabilizers,anti-psychotics, SNRI'S) this medication has yeilded me the best overall results. I had very little side effects to this drug, and the only one I had was a lack of appetite and weight loss, which I was very pleased with. This has also been the longest drug I have been on. The only reason I stopped taking it, was due to my BPD/Bipolar 2, making it difficult to find a drug that either works at all, or for an extended period of time. In the end, I had to keep upping the doses of Prozac until I maxed out, because my symptoms wouldn't stay stable.
