We have increased to 27mg per day (due to growth). We definitely notice a difference if she hasnt taken them for a day (lack of impulse control, fidgety, high energy). The tablets are small enough for her to swallow with minimal effort, which is a plus! She has had a significant growth spurt as she nears puberty, so difficult to tell if weight gain is due to the meds (I think mostly not). She does complain of headaches occasionally. Overall, we have been satisfied with this medication.

However, the one benefit I see to this med over the others is that his appetite has increased.  On the other meds, he barely ate and he was under-weight for his age.  Now he has gained a few pounds and has grown a few inches in the last 6 months. I think we'll stick with this one for a while.

I have taken Dexedrine, Adderall, and finally Vyvanse.  So far Methylin ER is the least ""edgy"".  Seems mild while still helping me focus at work. I haven't had wierd thoughts so far like on the other meds. Feel more ""normal""."

i have two children diagnosed with ADHD, and both of their schoolwork has improved over this last school year... thanks to this medication and other therapy. my older son could not focus before, and my second son (who was also diagnosed with aspergers disorder)has begun to warm up to people."
8$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/3/2008 6:54:05 AM$Reviewer: onetogo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$Once my son started high school I knew he needed to be assessed for ADHD. In the first 5 weeks of the school year he was failing 3 classes. As soon as he started taking just 10mg of Methylin ER he could focus and made the honor roll. The effects last the entire school day. He struggles a bit to concentrate on homework, but so far it's  manageable. He has put on 10 pound in 6 weeks though. He isn't hungry all day, but pigs out in the evenings.

worked well for him, but we have had 
to adjust the medication at least twice
a year, due to growth.  Over all it works
well for him"

However, I experience chest pains and faintness perhaps once a month.  My doctor suggested it wasn't a concern, though it seems to be a drawback from the medicine's benefits.

I didn't think I would ever medicate my child in this way but I'm glad that I have because he is more focused and less aggressive (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS MEDICATION).  In the short time since his diagnoses, we have tried about 4 different medications and this particular drug has been the least effective. He acts as if he's not currently taking any medication.  In the 1 month that he's been on this drug he has shown severe aggression towards his 2 yr old brother and has been very whiny.  The medication that has been the most effective is Metadate CD.  He was doing great in school and wonderful with his little brother.  Starting tomorrow morning we're going to try Conterta but if this fails we'll go back to Metadate CD in a heartbeat.
