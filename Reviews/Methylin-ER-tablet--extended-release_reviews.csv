1$Condition: Other$4/28/2012 2:53:57 AM$Reviewer: Why Not? BP aTX, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have ADD not ADHD.  This medication works much better than adderall or ritalin. I've taken the non ER type and it is not as effective.  I take the ER in the morning and it lasts all day.  I can take one at lunch if I want/need to.  I do not feel speeded up anxious.  I concentrate and focus rather than start six things and only finish one.  It does not make me feel high either.  My ADD is intensified by Bipolar 1 late onset.  Some days before I got on Methylin ER I was a total mess. I got nothing done for days. And I tried. I got overwhelmed by the simplest tasks which added up to a mountain that went volcano and erupted on me. Even if the tasks were simply daily living. I was/am a professional (lawyer) this drug has allowed me to do pro bono legal work again and work part time in a non legal setting. I keep my home and life in much better order. All the while I don't feel high or amped. It has been a lifesaver.

We have increased to 27mg per day (due to growth). We definitely notice a difference if she hasnt taken them for a day (lack of impulse control, fidgety, high energy). The tablets are small enough for her to swallow with minimal effort, which is a plus! She has had a significant growth spurt as she nears puberty, so difficult to tell if weight gain is due to the meds (I think mostly not). She does complain of headaches occasionally. Overall, we have been satisfied with this medication. 
5$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/2/2010 8:04:05 AM$Reviewer: suzette, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) $4$4$5$My son is 13 now and he has been on other meds for his ADHD and they worked just as well as the Methylin ER so the switch to this medication was mostly for economical reasons (the co-pay for the other meds was too high).It keeps my son focused and less hyperactive throughout most of the day. However, the one benefit I see to this med over the others is that his appetite has increased.  On the other meds, he barely ate and he was under-weight for his age.  Now he has gained a few pounds and has grown a few inches in the last 6 months. I think we'll stick with this one for a while.

I feel more energetic and optomistic after one month of 40 mg per day. My Dr. monitors my reaction, blood pressure and heart rate every month before another dose.

I have taken Dexedrine, Adderall, and finally Vyvanse.  So far Methylin ER is the least ""edgy"".  Seems mild while still helping me focus at work. I haven't had wierd thoughts so far like on the other meds. Feel more ""normal""."

Also I was told to take it 3xs a day and it's difficult to remember to stop what I'm doing to take it all 3xs.  I am tired all day no matter how much sleep I get and my focusing is only slightly better.

I take this to boost the Pristiq and the Geodon.  It lifts my mood and helps me to focus on life rather tham my depression. I thank-God for this medication.  It saved my life, literally.  It makes me feel like life is worth living again.

12$Condition: Other$7/21/2009 11:19:41 AM$Reviewer: caboose313, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"i am prescribed to 20mg methylin ER twice a day, but the dr told me i could take 2 at once or something like that just dont go over 40mg a day, this is a great drug for people that need it, but it is also addicting, and a person should know what theyre doing before they get a script to it, i became dependant after a month of straight use, but after i realized that it was getting to be that way i stopped taking them for a few weeks and only take them when i am going to need to do something, work school ect., that day. but since they are the backbone chemical to methamphetamines they shouldnt be given to young children, but my story.. i have suffered from severe social anxiety and depression along with a case of ADD, i used to take zoloft to try to combat the depression and anxiety and have experimented with xanax, colonzopam, ect.. and all those pills just turned me into a different person, the zoloft turned me into a heavy drinker, and the benzos turned me into a zombie. the methylin is different it is a upper for me and i have so much energy, motovation, confidence. i feel like i can do anything i set my mind to so to speak. but there are some downfalls to it, you get a hell of a cotton mouth, the comedown is horrible and you just want to sleep, and for me there was a couple sexual problems but it only happened once when i hadnt taken the script in about 3 weeks so there was no tolerance, but if there isnt the difficulty in bed with it, it makes sex a million times better, you have so much energy and just never runs out for a few hours which is longer than id like to be there haha, there is also a drop in appetite, which for some ppl is a good thing but i'm 5""10 and 120lbs and was 135lbs before i started taking it, it would be good to pair it with a THC pill. but overall it is a wonderful drug for people who need it and is not to be abused. theres no point in getting tweaked out on rittalin. when u take too many you feel like ur alive and moving but out of ur head."

i have two children diagnosed with ADHD, and both of their schoolwork has improved over this last school year... thanks to this medication and other therapy. my older son could not focus before, and my second son (who was also diagnosed with aspergers disorder)has begun to warm up to people."

In the first 5 weeks of the school year he was failing 3 classes. As soon as he started taking just 10mg of Methylin ER he could focus and made the honor roll. The effects last the entire school day. He struggles a bit to concentrate on homework, but so far it's  manageable. He has put on 10 pound in 6 weeks though. He isn't hungry all day, but pigs out in the evenings.

However, I experience chest pains and faintness perhaps once a month.  My doctor suggested it wasn't a concern, though it seems to be a drawback from the medicine's benefits.

I didn't think I would ever medicate my child in this way but I'm glad that I have because he is more focused and less aggressive (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS MEDICATION).  In the short time since his diagnoses, we have tried about 4 different medications and this particular drug has been the least effective. He acts as if he's not currently taking any medication.  In the 1 month that he's been on this drug he has shown severe aggression towards his 2 yr old brother and has been very whiny.  The medication that has been the most effective is Metadate CD.  He was doing great in school and wonderful with his little brother.  Starting tomorrow morning we're going to try Conterta but if this fails we'll go back to Metadate CD in a heartbeat.
