I had recently taken myself of Amytripaline as my eye sight was getting very bad. The Clonidine is more effective than Amytripiline. I was surprised. It's been almost 11 years since I've experienced this little pain. I recommend for neuro pain.

Are there any males using the same or at least one of these?  I have a question that only a male could answer.
