0$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$9/25/2019 9:21:36 PM$Reviewer: Asiah , 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I had took this medication for a year, for bipolar, and psychosis I have gained 50lbs from this medicine and now Iâ??m 194lbs. It helped my anxiety , and manic issues but didnâ??t help my thoughts because now Iâ??m fat. I had no motivation, as well as no confidence . My thoughts would be racing non stop. I was on 2mg twice a day. Moved it to 1 and I was still experiencing bad symptoms; such as being very hungry, and very lazy. Iâ??d take it and get so relaxed I wouldnâ??t get up from my bed. Since I am off of it now, Iâ??ve gained all my motivation back, working out , walking, and able to control my eating . If anyone is experiencing these problems or trying to find out about this medicine , I recommend you to not take it . Unless you like being over weight. I am still taking something else for anxiety btw . Everything else is fine BUT this medication. Donâ??t take it .

Just came off Seroquel because of the nasty side effects!!! Then I see all these reviews of 30-150 lbs of weight gain, oh no way! I am so short, and have severe crippling back, I can't support 20 more pounds! I told my doctor that. But I have been on Latuda in the past as well. All three of these are Anti-psychotic drugs, women....you are lactating because the increase in prolactin in the pituitary gland (brain). My ob-gyn had me tested back in 2017. It wasn't the side effect ""missed periods"" it is more like, if you stay on this medication ladies, it STOPS ovulation. I know, I didn't have a menstrual cycle the entire time I took Latuda, and Risperidone is pretty much the same. I'm going to see how much weight I gain after a week, and I will weigh the pros and cons then."
4$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$3/6/2019 5:55:27 PM$Reviewer: Michelle, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$2$I just started taking this medication and I'm coming off Abilify. I've been taking it for 3 days and so far, I had a very deep sleep last night but the first night I had insomnia. I'm starting to feel a little sedated. Will come back to review it when I've taken it for a longer period of time. I'm so scared I'm going to gain weight on this medicine because that's what I read like everywhere!
5$Condition: Schizophrenia$8/17/2017 6:21:51 PM$Reviewer: xxvxx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$1$1$I do see improvements in function. I can usually lose weight with a regular workout routine and just about any food. However, about 3-4 after taking this medicine if I eat some food from Denny's my metabolism is screwed. Maybe I should follow a low carb diet on this medication (50 g).

This med has completely eradicated the outbursts, but his affect and personality are totally flat.  He has no emotional reaction to ANYTHING, which is preferable, but not ideal.  We sometimes have to make these choices, I guess.

7$Condition: Psychosis caused by a Disease$3/20/2017 8:03:19 PM$Reviewer: NightChild, 13-18 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$3$"I am on 3mg of Riperidone. So far, I have gained 40  pounds because I have been off and on it. On days off, I sleep 12 or more hours a night, not including occasional 2 hour naps. When I don't sleep this much, I am tired beyond compare. I do not know if it affects my period since I am also on the Evra Patch Birth Control, but I do get tender leaky breasts. For me, this symptoms are livable. The only I don't care for is the weight gain, but I also don't exercise. Although I stayed in the mental ward for a week, it doesn't mean the medication didn't help. Without it, I wouldn't be the happy, fairly-stable person I am today. I have been on risperidone for 2 years and it helped me keep the psychosis reasonably quiet enough to let me learn how to cope with it on my own. At times, it'll seem like the medication isn't working it all. It will feel like you're on them for no reason. This is because there may be other causes (stress, etc.) that will make you have some ""mishaps"". It would of been a lot harder to handle my psychosis if I never took this medication. For me, it was worth it. However, it seems to have given me liver problems (waiting for diagnosis) and I may have to discontinue the meds. I think I am ready to take on my psychosis one-on-one."

This helped with his psychosis but this has damaged him more than did him any good. He stopped taking it but the after effects break my heart.

While it did ease my hallucinations as it was designed to do, it made me gain an unbelievable amount of weight & seemed to turn me into an emotionless zombie. I am obviously glad it helped with my hallucinations, but it did more hurt than help in my opinion.

It also gives them higher cholesterol. The older girl was taken off it for a little while by their doctor, and the had less appetite and lost weight, she's now a healthy weight. When she was on it the first time her cholesterol was high too. Strange thing was the doctor that gave her the medication sent her for the blood work and didn't even mention the results. It changed her mood, but it is not worth jeapordizing her arteries or her getting over weight again. The younger one is irratable, and tired when she's on it.
15$Condition: Other$8/1/2015 10:35:38 AM$Reviewer: kmac, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$3$My son has autism/asperger's syndrome and was having a difficult time staying on task and focusing in school. His psych doctor suggested this med in conjuction with fluoxetine for depression. The drug has worked, it took @4 weeks to become effective but he has gained 35lbs since. I am very concerned about the weight gain and he is taking the lowest dosage 1 mg. From one parent to another, definitely read the side effects and have a back up plan for the weight gain. Otherwise, the drug is very effective. Notice the difference and he is much better. I hope this helps for parents with teenagers.

19$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$7/8/2014 3:43:45 PM$Reviewer: Happy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed risperidone 13 years ago, however by denying my diagnosis I didn't commit to the medication until two years ago. I have now been to taking risperidone daily for the past two years. I feel normal again! It took about one year to achieve total wellness. Now my life is back on track. I love this medication.

I had been having rage and irritability and it had gotten to the point where I was afraid I might hurt my kids or myself.  I called the pdoc and she added the Risperidone and the next day all the rage and irritability was gone, along with the residual depression.   It is a lifesaver.  I'm just worried about weight gain.  I;ve actually lost 2 lbs on it but I;m still worried.  I packed on 60 lbs in 2010 due to psych meds and I still haven;t lost it.

22$Condition: Other$5/27/2014 2:47:48 AM$Reviewer: jerems82, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$2$"I first began taking Risperdal(name brand) in 2007, when I was having very serious psychological problems that involved terrible disorganized thinking, delusional thoughts, OCD, and Tourette's. I never heard any voices. It was just so bad, my disorganized thinking process, that I decided to get help in 2007, when I turned 25. In my late teens, I had tiny precursors but then at about 21, in 2003, I became so very sick. I lost my mind, literally. I could no longer pay attention, and was agitated, and had anxiety so bad. All of this plus terrible concentration problems. In 2007, the psychiatrist prescribed me Paxil, Klonopin, and Risperdal. It was just so amazing how much ""junk"" was cleared out of my head. It was like a really humid day, and then a cold front sweeps through and takes all of the moisture with it, and it becomes cool, dry, with no humidity. That's how I would describe these meds as feeling for about the 1st 3 to 3.5 years. Then I switched to a generic Risperidone, and began having some problems again. My Tourette's came back, in full force. My thoughts were once again scattered. Not as bad, but this was junk compared to Janssen's brand name ""Risperdal."" So I give the Risperidone up all together, and became nuts in the head again with thoughts and garbage flying everywhere in my head. So back on the generic I went. Since I switched to generic, the combo of Risperidone and Clonazepam has caused me much trouble with wetting the bed. I've tried to go off the Risperidone numerous times, but always got back on it due to the craziness in my head. The only complaint I have about Risperidone, is that the Generic isn't as good. Also, it makes me go crazy upon taking it. So I take it right before bedtime, literally. It is a wonderful drug because I have most of my mind and life back. Even though I've gained 150 lbs and have unpleasant side effects. It's great knowing I can have myself back, not all, but most of my old self with the amazing help of Risperidone. 9/10"

Now I have Pituitary Gland Tumor, Pineal Gland tumor, diabetes, hiper insulinism. I had urinary incontinence as fecal one (that stopped).

Just in case, after one month taking it, I had a super extraa menstrual bleeding and bothe hands slept with tingling. Since then hands problem had never stopped.

Before I started this, my other medication was Zyprexa, then Seroquel. I have a mild dose, it lowers my anxiety, stress, stops any hallucinations (which I forget about), and helps me feel good throughout the day. Zyprexa nearly killed me with a rare side-effect, and Seroquel ruined my health drastically causing my gall-bladder to be affected (removed). I don't recommend this for everyone, but for schizophrenia, it's a breakthrough.

Doctor than lowered anti-depressant to lower dosage. Did gain some weight but I don't mind I'm so much happier.

No complaints, no side effects I'm aware of. Again I have been taking 1MG of Risperidone once a day at bedtime for years.

I'm more stable. Great product.

The anti-depressant is Effexor XR. I did try the generic version of Effexor XR released a few months ago.

Within 2 weeks I was back in the toliet with Depression.

And NO I don't have anything against using generics some of the other drugs I take are generic and they work fine.

Something must be different in the generic Effexor XR and the Namebrand. I was very surprized how quickly I slide back into depression.

Since being on this med he is moving slowly, experiencing muscle stiffness, feeling ""flat"" (emotionless), and having nervousness/restlessness, and mood swings.

She heard voices telling her terrible things. Once place on this medication she rarely hears voices. She does appear to be medicated. She's slowed down quite a bit but has continued her daily functions. It's a relief to know she doesn't hear the bad voices anymore. Although for myself and family members it was hard to adjust to seeing her in a medicated state. I would recommend this drug highly if one is hearing voices....
