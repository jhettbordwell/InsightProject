0$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/30/2019 10:57:43 AM$Reviewer: Anonymous, 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$Very powerful for fixing attention problems. It makes it much easier to work, however the side effects are strange and concerning. There is a significant loss of appetite and dry mouth, but these are not terribly strange. While the medicine wears off (which takes hours), paranoia and confusion can set in. While these happen, there is a feeling of freezing despite the actual temperature, possibly due to a lack of food? Either way, very good for what it is meant to do but unfortunate side effects.

I'm hoping it continues to work, hes only complained of slight dizziness and some nausea but other than that he says he feels fine:) I'm only upset I didn't take him to the dr sooner! 
3$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/14/2019 9:03:08 AM$Reviewer: Kmennis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I am an adult with ADHD since childhood. My psychiatrist and I tried several medications including Adderall which gave me mild anxiety. I take Vyvanse during the day and methylphenidate in evenings when I have school work. The methylphenidate helps keep me focused with no side effects. Only issue is that it only lasts a couple hours. Most ADHD medications do not last as long as they are supposed to. Vyvanse is a 12 hr med and I am doing good if I get eight hrs with it. Would prefer to take Vyvanse twice a day, but insurance would never pay for that, so methylphenidate is a great option.

5$Condition: Depression$12/22/2018 7:22:44 PM$Reviewer: Tbk , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"The only issue wity methylphenidate is increased anxiety. Despite having depression related to anxiety, I still advocate 100% for this drug. It saved my life. I just wish doctors would see it for what it is - my PCP views it as a dangerous drug that is only for recreational use when not used for ADHD. However my psychiatrist prescribed me Concerta 36mg (switched to methylphenidate SR due to financial reasons) and I haven't been happier. My anxiety is only worse when I'm not productive. But this medication allows me to be. It allows me to get out of bed in the morning. It allows me to shower and get dressed and clean my house. Of the 7 antidepressants I have been on in the past 2 years none have had such a profound effect. 

I truly hope more research is done so that people like myself are able to access the medication they need, despite it being off-label. I have no desire to abuse this drug when it has given me my life back. "

The side effects are not too bad. I do notice that I tend to yawn quite a bit when I'm taking it, but oddly, I'm not tired. It also gives me sweaty palms. Otherwise, I feel it is working well.

And occasionally muscle  twitching, body temperature decreased, numbness in my fingers and toes which made it hard for me to write/ type. I always took prescribed amount. The medicine did not help much with my condition but gave me all these side effects inside. Would not recommend.

I've heard that you can build up a tolerance to the medication; however, I never felt like that happened to me over the 5 years I took it.  I was prescribed 60 mg a day, which was the best, but usually found that I could take less by breaking the pill in half.  I felt like it was too much sometimes, and it was time to take a pill, so I'd break it in half and save the remainder for another day.  It had always helped me achieve better grades without feeling like i had to try.  I watched other students struggle and I felt like the drug in a way kind of cheated out better grades.  I definitely recommend the plain methylphenidate tablets.  It seemed like the long acting capsules were not manageable.  We can't take less than the prescription and the three hour tablets allow this.

16$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/1/2014 8:41:36 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$"I started taking ADHD meds in 2009. I started with Vyvanse.  I had terrible side-effects: constipation, inability to urinate (I would have an extreme desire to pee like if I didn't immediately go to the bathroom I was going to pee my pants. Then, I would stand there for 20 to 30 seconds before beginning an it would be a squirt, then another 10 sec's with another squirt and when I couldn't go anymore it felt like I hadn't emptied my bladder.) I would get terrible acid-indigestion, my back would hurt, headaches, and the worse of all the side-effects was the numbness in my hands and feet. The numbness at night got to a point that my fingers felt like they were on fire(literally burning).  I actually had to wear wrist bands, like people who have carpel tunnel syndrome, and that would alleviate the burning enuf to go to sleep.
The doctor changed my medication to Adderall and I had identical side-effects; no worse, but no less. He suggested that I continue the medication and eventually the side effects will dissipate.  I took the Adderall for a year and 1/2 and the side effects never lessened.(by the way, I'm not a masochist). I just enjoyed the psychological benefits so much that I continued to soldier-on with the terrible side effects so I could have focus, have conversations, organize my thoughts, have less depression, be calm etc.,etc.
The misery finally won over and I quit taking the medication.  Nearly a year later I was so upset that I couldn't have the good without the bad. I nearly begged my doctor for something else that could help.  This is 2014 and I first started ADHD medication in 2009 with horrible results.  It took me badgering my doctor to get him to give me Ritalin.  His first response was: ""Ritalin is for children"" but he finally gave me a prescription and all I can say is WOW! All the ADHD problems addressed and no side-effects.  It's only been 2 months on Ritalin but when I took the other drugs I experienced the side-effects within 2 days."
17$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/15/2014 1:51:28 AM$Reviewer: ecstaticmom, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$4$4$My son has been taking this for 4 months, starting just after he turned 6. He has done a total 180. He went from almost being expelled in kindergarten to a star student. His handwriting is now legible and he can sit and read me a book with no problem. I went from not wanting to medicate my child to grateful that I did. It didn't make him a zombie and he still has plenty of personality. This drug won't work for everyone, and can have some horrible effects on some people. All ADHD drugs are trial and error. He does metabolize it faster than he should so we only get about 10 hours out of a 12 hour dose but on the plus side of that, he sleeps fine. He did stop asking to eat throughout the day, and lost weight as a result but his Dr talked to HIM about eating and eating high protein foods so he wouldn't lose anymore. A month later, he had gained all but 2 oz of it back. We still have to remind him to eat but he will if he's asked to. I've known since he was 2 that he had ADHD and I'm glad that I finally decided to address medicating him. He's now the delightful little boy I knew was always in him somewhere. My family and friends have noticed the huge change and now ask him to have sleepovers and playdates, which almost never happened before Concerta. He'll start going to Boys & Girls Club in the fall after school and he's super excited, which would have never been possible without this medication.

Virtually eliminated insomnia, impacted cholesterol numbers and stabilizd my blood pressure at great levels. After a lifetime of adhd coping mechanisms in place along with this relatively mild drug has worked wonders for me. In the years since restarting this drug as an adult I have made incredible professional and personal progress. I think too much unrealistic expectations are placed on this drug but it is not a magic pill. It works great for me used in conjunction with coping habits I have developed throughout my life. 
23$Condition: Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day$1/12/2014 7:43:58 PM$Reviewer: SleepyinChicago, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$4$5$"I have been on methylphenidate for almost a year now, and I believe it does what it is supposed to. I've been taking lexapro for 4 years now, and it did not interact negatively, which is a plus. I was prescribed methylphenidate because I would feel tired 24/7. And not just a little tired. I felt like I'd swam the English channel - after taking a 12 hour ""nap."" The issue for me is that my doctors prescribed it without stopping to consider why I had narcoleptic patterns. When I first started methylphenidate, the results were immediate and helpful. Unfortunately, methylphenidate can affect heart rate, as all stimulants can. Now the drug is of little use to me. I could take 50 mg and feel absolutely nothing. Besides building a tolerance, I think that methylphenidate is ineffective when the root of one's sleeping disorder lies within the cardiovascular system. I had an echocardiogram done and it turns out I have bradycardia, the symptoms of which were worsened by methylphenidate. For ADD, ADHD, and things of that nature, this medication seems effective. However, if I were a physician, I would think twice before prescribing it to someone just for the symptoms of sleeping spells and inability to concentrate. Needless to say, I won't be taking methylphenidate any longer and I'm going to see a new doctor. Make sure your doctor has ruled out heart and other cardio problems before starting you on methylphenidate. I feel more sleepy and unable to concentrate after taking it now, which is incredibly inconvenient seeing as how it's finals week. Also, as with any medication, be wary of dosage and how long you have to be on methylphenidate. I've heard some unfortunate stories from parents whose children were on it long-term and had some dependency and neurological issues. My experience was so-so, but I don't think it's the drug's fault. I say it's worth a try, since for the first month or so I did see a lovely improvement in my ability to stay conscious and focused. "

I started on 54mg and it wasn't enough so then I moved up to 72mg. That was way too much for me and I started freaking out. My heart was racing, I was running around in circles trying to get my energy out and it just hurt really bad. So then I took 63mg, and I have been fine on it, although I feel that it could help me focus more. But the worst thing about it is it makes me depressed. I was already sorta depressed before but when I take this, it makes it so much worse.

I was able to focus on tasks much better on either dose but I don't feel a come down from the 5mg pill. However, after taking this med once or twice a day for 3 or 4 days I had become easily agitated and somewhat agressive and I'm a pretty mellow guy. I only take it now if I have a task that requires my attention for long periods of time because I do have a problem staying focused but I'm not hyperactive and never have been.

The last 3 years I have gotten feedback from the teachers indicating minor behavioral problems with him such as, he has a hard time focusing, he cant sit still, he speaks very loud, and now in 2nd grade, his comprehension in reading was starting to reflect a problem. I never realized this at home because at home he read and comprehended his books just fine, however, these were books of his preference. I took him to the doctor who recommended this medication. Although it has only been a week, I have notice a change with focus and patience. I watched my son who never sat still, draw detailed pictures for an hour(He has never sat more than 10 min on anything other than video games). As far as school goes, he has been paying more attention in class and finishing his homework independently. My only complaint is that when this medication wears off, it really wears off and it seems like all of the controlled hyper was bottled throughout the day, then released at once but only lasts for a little while and doesn't interfere with bedtime. Overall this medication has helped and I now see a side of my child that I have never seen before and I am really pleased.

I started taking it in 5th grade and I'm now in my first year of college. Concerta has helped me to actually do homework instead of getting bored 5 minutes into homework and class. I have become an actual student and avid learner thanks to concerta. I think the new generic has made me break out because I used to have great skin but I can fix that. I would get used to the medication or I would realize it was too low of a dosage so my dosage is up to 54. Although through out the years the one bad side effect is that I would have upset stomach or weight loss but I was fine with that but the extreme side effect that I still fight when I don't take my medication is my overwhelming and complete ravenous hunger I get. I will literally eat everything in sight. So I feel a necessity to take my concerta everyday. But besides that I would recommend this to anyone wanting an ADHD medication.

What I can say is it has had several pro's along with some con's. Here is a list of Pro's and Con's of Generic Ritalin IR that I've experienced. 

Pros:
- Better Concentration (my ability to focus has moved to having 25% focus to 60% focus)
- Helps me be more awake and focused in class at school. 
- Grades have slightly improved in school.
- Doesn't last too long so I can take it around 6pm and still be in bed no later than 1am. 
- It's Cheap

Cons: 
- I sometimes crash and get really tired when the effects wear off.
- I sometimes have an empty feeling while on it, it's similar to depression but not a bad (it still sucks though)
- Hard to take since it doesn't last long, sometimes it lasts 2 hours other times 4-6. 
- I feel bored on it when doing things I normally enjoy.

Apparently concerta is no longer covered due to this cheaper pill. My 10 year old has been making strides since going from adderall (too much weight loss) straterra (ineffective) to concerta (working the best so far). Now with this new generic, he has a daily scowl on his face, simple arguments turn to serious tantrums and none of these things were present when on concerta. If this is just a generic version then why such serious side effects that the other didn't have. School is starting soon and playing with medications for my son is completely unacceptable. I will be meeting with my doctor to correct this week, but the fact that insurance can just change on a dime is pretty ridiculous.

I have been taking Lexapro 5mg for almost a year now as well. The first week or so I was slightly satisfied, but when the medicine kicked in I felt very jittery and motivated for about 30-45 minutes, and then that feeling wore off almost immediately and slumped into a depression until I took the next pill. When I took it in the afternoon I felt pretty good but only for 30 minutes at the most, and then the same depression set in. 

I do have a slightly hyperactive thyroid, which I think might have been affecting the medicine's results with me. I had to go off of it after 2 weeks, though. The down feeling after was too much to put up with, and my fatigue actually increased on it."

I have increased the dosage a bit over the years, but as my life got more complicated the medicine became more of an issue. I am a serious athlete and have struggle with balancing this medicine, training, school, and my health. I find that there are several very serious problems  with this medicine.  Concerta dramatically decreases appetite to the point were i had to force-feed myself because my body was hypoglycemic and i felt faint after hard workouts. While the medz realyl helped at school, it is not long enough lasting so that i can effectively do homework at 9pm, but if i was to take a larger dose, i would never sleep.  some other side effects that have really hurt me are abdominal cramping, dramatically increased sweating and intense nausea, all of which are serious issues when you are a cyclist and training/racing in 90*F.  This medicine is fine if you arent an athlete, but if you are, you will find that its is helpful only if you can master/ work around its (potentially) serious side effects.  For me, this has been a deciding factor in my life, even though as of now im still a teenager. i hope that this review has been helpful, and that more reviews like this may motivate the company Concerta to develop a more athlete friendly medication

I was totally freaked out, I stopped it immediately and was terrified to try anything else. I also got very moody, I would space out on the way to work and get angry for no reason. Other than that, it worked well, I was focusing on housework and arriving to work on time. I just didn't like those side effects.

I was taking therapy, and my therapist told me that I had ADHD. THAT was a surprise. (Not really.) I had known for years prior. So, I went to my PCP, (Primary Care Physician) and told her what was up. I told her that the night before it had taken me three hours to only read a few pages out of my book, and that I needed to do SOMETHING. So, she prescribed me with Ritalin. The WONDER drug. It takes about 30 minutes to set in, and lasts about 4 hours. I could read and understand what I was reading, and also, I could sit STILL! Yes, COMPLETELY still! I love it so much, because if you only have to sit still for a couple of hours, just take half the dosage! It is amazing, non-addictive, and helps you to keep focused. I love it, and if you think you have ADHD, or ADD, ask your PCP about Ritalin. =)

Having been on it for so long (17 years) the way it affects me and how well it works for my condition and what side effects I get has changed over the years. When I was a teenager I experienced amphetamine psychosis, severe paranoia, panic attacks, although I was pretty screwed and depressed anyway so that may have fuelled those side effects too.
In 2003 I began taking this drug with Modafinil as I wanted to cut down my daily MFD intake, The MFD only lasts a few hours, sometimes less depending on what I am doing, I have to take a lot more when I dance, presumably to do with metabolic increase. At it's best it gives me a relatively semi-normal life (as much as is possible for a severe narcoleptic) at it's worst it's side effects caused me to have fits of rage, extreme mood swings and paranoia, memory loss and feeling spaced out, escalated existing problems with depression and damaged my metabolism beyond repair, but unfortunately until the FDA approve Orexin A as a treatment for narcolepsy I am forced to take tonns of speed every day. This drug is basically strong amphetamine, please don't give it to your kids unless you absolutely have to!!!! 
This drug is all I have to help me have a few hours awake each day, without it I may as well be in a coma!"

The side effects I've experienced have been the ability to brake away from something I'm working on and over explaining things to my kids at times, but they have adapted to letting me know that I'm overdoing it. The only real down side with it is having to get a prescription every month for a refill. My new Doctor told me that he has done a lot of research on Ritalin and the newer drugs on the market. He said that other than price (Ritalin being the cheapest) the newer drugs have little difference/benefit from Ritalin for the condition I have. Well, it is working for me and I hope this might help someone.

He would worry excessively and he is only 3 yrs. old. I have seen dramatic improvement and am very happy. Anyone having problems needs to remember that everyone is different and what works for one may not work for another. however for my situation it is nice to not be pulling my hair out everyday.

I have found that it takes 2 hours for the dose to ""kick in"" and help me to stay awake. First dose in a.m. 20mg time release + 10 mg short-acting. Once I am awake, I am AWAKE, but lasts only about 5 hours. Must take addn'l 5 to 10 mg to make it through the day.  Have gained weight (10lbs.)in 5 mo. Not hungry during the day, but ravenous once the drug wears off in evening.  Exp. side effects: Severe dry mouth w irritated gums, nausea, ringing in ears, at times, have blurred vision. Easily jumpy and perspires profusely which can be embarrassing, get the feeling people who do not know me think I am a drug addict or a junkie because of the sweating.  They give me odd looks in the grocery store and post office when I am dripping sweat like a race horse after running a Derby.  Seems like a lot to pay for in order to stay awake for a few hours, but it beats the alternative of sleeping 18 to 20 out of 24 hours a day, falling asleep while eating a meal, being unable to drive or even have a conversation with my husband without nodding off.  There just aren't many safe drugs that are effective for this problem.  Had a severe reaction to the newest and most promising, non-narcotic drug for this disorder and there isn't much for my MD to choose from to prescribe for me.  The remaining drugs have similar side effects and will be harder on my system. "

Her Dr. notice that stress and pressure from her teachers and consecuently classmates were making her potential ADD worst. It was never clear to me how serious her ADD really was because she responded perfectly to any learning ""therapy"" she took. Later in life and with out Ritalin she became a competive swimmer making the national team. She took ritalin for 3.6 years starting when she was
6 years old. She only took it during school days and in a very small dosage (1/4 of a pill in the morning with her breakfast during the first year and 1/2 of a pill during the next 2.6 years) During this time she was able to sleep a full night sleep and although very thin she never stopped growing. Her Dr.(a pediatric neurologist) closely supervise her every 4 months during this time and he decided when she should stop taking this medication. At first her concentration suffered a slight relapse but she was afraid of not getting the same grades at school. (Again the stress factor was present) Eventually she was able to manage an 8.6 scool average learned 2 languajes and win medals in the national and international swimming events. She is a wonderful 17 year old teenager today. I still wonder if the problem really falls into the educational system and it´s inability to solve the need of educating massively forgetting individuality. My question is ¿Is there only one type of inteligent process to problem solving? ¿Were her tears necesarly? My final conclusion is that:
Ritalin did help her against school and social tagging. In a different world of circunstances it might have not been needed.  "

I presently take the immediate acting pills at 180 mg/day,i.e.,40mg tid. I took Concerta 36mg/day for 3 years and it stopped working well so I was changed to Adderall, then to Dextroamphetamine. The Dextroamphetamine worked well, but it made my skin break out badly. If we can get the dose of Methylphenidate optimized I will stay with it. I am studying for the GRE so that I can go to graduate school. The medicine helps me to stay on task and keeps my mind from wandering. My ADHD manifests mostly as the inattentive type with comorbid depression, anxiety disorder and slight shizoaffective disorder. It has taken many years, various doctors, and many trials of different medications to get the correct mix and dosages. Thank God I am stable enough to go back to school and almost get the education that I had originally attempted. I  attended 3 years of medical school before I had to withdraw due to symptoms of my then undiagnosed ADHD. I am now 54 years old and until fairly recently have missed a diagnosis of ADHD all these years. It is only extremely evident that I have ADHD when I take the medications for it. I go from a good student to my normal excellent student status. The attendant symptoms of ADHD have crippled my chances for the lifestyle I had planned, but I can't gripe much because the pain they caused me drove me into the loving arms of my dear Lord and Savior and I am now one of His ordained and grateful ministers, a path I would not have taken without the pain from ADHD.

He never had a problem learning - the ultimate multi-tasker - but most children did not enjoy his company.  But now,he is invited to all the birthday parties and even has been star student!  This otherwise would not have been possible without this medicine.  The only issue, but is relatively insignificant, is the pills are in 10 mg and he has to take 15.  I have to be very careful in seperating the medicine and splitting pills.  But this is hardly a problem considering the success it has given my son.

IT HELPS ME GET GOING IN THE MORNING AND HELPS GIVE ME THE ABILITY TO COMPLETE TASKS AND TRY TO PRIORITIZE.  WHEN I FILLED MY SCRIPT THIS MONTH I RECIEVED THESE DIFFERENT ""GENERIC"" PURPLE PILLS.  THEY ARE HORRIBLE, THEY MAKE ME LIKE A DRONE.  THE ONLY THING I CAN DO SUCCESSFULLY IS CROSSWORD PUZZLES. THESE PILLS AFFECTED ME MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE ""METHYLIN."" THEY MAKE ME NERVOUS, NOT WANT TO BE AROUND PEOPLE AND TO ""BLAH"" TO THINK STRAIGHT NEVERMIND MANAGING LIFE AND BEING PRODUCTIVE.  I THINK THESE ARE MORE DRAINING ON ME THAN NOT TAKING ANYTHING. MAYBE BETTER FOR A HYPERACTIVE PERSON OR ONE WHO DOES NOT CARE ABOUT HAVING EMOTIONS. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ""VERSION"" OF ""GENERICS"" WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE MANY MORE AND MORE INTENSE SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDING SWEATING, ZOMBIE-LIKE STATE, HEADACHES, UNEMOTIONAL (DON'T CARE), UNMOTIVATED AND FEAR OF SOCIAL/CROWDED SITUATIONS (EVEN GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE). I WILL REFUSE THE FILLING OF MY PRESCRIPTION WITH THESE PURPLE PILLS FROM HERE ON OUT."

I've been using this medicine for almost 6 years now because ritalin stopped working for me. At 54 mg, it lasts for about 8-10 hours. I have noticed that I do not experience hunger while on the medication, and also feel a minor absence of emotion(not as lively or active as normal).
Overall, it helps me concentrate and focus in on things, which is what it is ment to do."
