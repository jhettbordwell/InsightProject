0$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/30/2019 10:57:43 AM$Reviewer: Anonymous, 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$Very powerful for fixing attention problems. It makes it much easier to work, however the side effects are strange and concerning. There is a significant loss of appetite and dry mouth, but these are not terribly strange. While the medicine wears off (which takes hours), paranoia and confusion can set in. While these happen, there is a feeling of freezing despite the actual temperature, possibly due to a lack of food? Either way, very good for what it is meant to do but unfortunate side effects.

I'm hoping it continues to work, hes only complained of slight dizziness and some nausea but other than that he says he feels fine:) I'm only upset I didn't take him to the dr sooner! 
3$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/14/2019 9:03:08 AM$Reviewer: Kmennis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I am an adult with ADHD since childhood. My psychiatrist and I tried several medications including Adderall which gave me mild anxiety. I take Vyvanse during the day and methylphenidate in evenings when I have school work. The methylphenidate helps keep me focused with no side effects. Only issue is that it only lasts a couple hours. Most ADHD medications do not last as long as they are supposed to. Vyvanse is a 12 hr med and I am doing good if I get eight hrs with it. Would prefer to take Vyvanse twice a day, but insurance would never pay for that, so methylphenidate is a great option.

I feel that 54mg would be a much more effective treatment.

The side effects are not too bad. I do notice that I tend to yawn quite a bit when I'm taking it, but oddly, I'm not tired. It also gives me sweaty palms. Otherwise, I feel it is working well.
9$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/7/2016 3:17:41 PM$Reviewer: Leah, 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$3$Every time I took this medicine I had a rapid heart beat, excess sweating, agitation, mood swings, decreased appetite. And occasionally muscle  twitching, body temperature decreased, numbness in my fingers and toes which made it hard for me to write/ type. I always took prescribed amount. The medicine did not help much with my condition but gave me all these side effects inside. Would not recommend.

I've heard that you can build up a tolerance to the medication; however, I never felt like that happened to me over the 5 years I took it.  I was prescribed 60 mg a day, which was the best, but usually found that I could take less by breaking the pill in half.  I felt like it was too much sometimes, and it was time to take a pill, so I'd break it in half and save the remainder for another day.  It had always helped me achieve better grades without feeling like i had to try.  I watched other students struggle and I felt like the drug in a way kind of cheated out better grades.  I definitely recommend the plain methylphenidate tablets.  It seemed like the long acting capsules were not manageable.  We can't take less than the prescription and the three hour tablets allow this.

I have been taking ""Concerta"" for 11 years. "
14$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/1/2014 8:41:36 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$"I started taking ADHD meds in 2009. I started with Vyvanse.  I had terrible side-effects: constipation, inability to urinate (I would have an extreme desire to pee like if I didn't immediately go to the bathroom I was going to pee my pants. Then, I would stand there for 20 to 30 seconds before beginning an it would be a squirt, then another 10 sec's with another squirt and when I couldn't go anymore it felt like I hadn't emptied my bladder.) I would get terrible acid-indigestion, my back would hurt, headaches, and the worse of all the side-effects was the numbness in my hands and feet. The numbness at night got to a point that my fingers felt like they were on fire(literally burning).  I actually had to wear wrist bands, like people who have carpel tunnel syndrome, and that would alleviate the burning enuf to go to sleep.
The doctor changed my medication to Adderall and I had identical side-effects; no worse, but no less. He suggested that I continue the medication and eventually the side effects will dissipate.  I took the Adderall for a year and 1/2 and the side effects never lessened.(by the way, I'm not a masochist). I just enjoyed the psychological benefits so much that I continued to soldier-on with the terrible side effects so I could have focus, have conversations, organize my thoughts, have less depression, be calm etc.,etc.
The misery finally won over and I quit taking the medication.  Nearly a year later I was so upset that I couldn't have the good without the bad. I nearly begged my doctor for something else that could help.  This is 2014 and I first started ADHD medication in 2009 with horrible results.  It took me badgering my doctor to get him to give me Ritalin.  His first response was: ""Ritalin is for children"" but he finally gave me a prescription and all I can say is WOW! All the ADHD problems addressed and no side-effects.  It's only been 2 months on Ritalin but when I took the other drugs I experienced the side-effects within 2 days."
15$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/15/2014 1:51:28 AM$Reviewer: ecstaticmom, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$4$4$My son has been taking this for 4 months, starting just after he turned 6. He has done a total 180. He went from almost being expelled in kindergarten to a star student. His handwriting is now legible and he can sit and read me a book with no problem. I went from not wanting to medicate my child to grateful that I did. It didn't make him a zombie and he still has plenty of personality. This drug won't work for everyone, and can have some horrible effects on some people. All ADHD drugs are trial and error. He does metabolize it faster than he should so we only get about 10 hours out of a 12 hour dose but on the plus side of that, he sleeps fine. He did stop asking to eat throughout the day, and lost weight as a result but his Dr talked to HIM about eating and eating high protein foods so he wouldn't lose anymore. A month later, he had gained all but 2 oz of it back. We still have to remind him to eat but he will if he's asked to. I've known since he was 2 that he had ADHD and I'm glad that I finally decided to address medicating him. He's now the delightful little boy I knew was always in him somewhere. My family and friends have noticed the huge change and now ask him to have sleepovers and playdates, which almost never happened before Concerta. He'll start going to Boys & Girls Club in the fall after school and he's super excited, which would have never been possible without this medication.

Virtually eliminated insomnia, impacted cholesterol numbers and stabilizd my blood pressure at great levels. After a lifetime of adhd coping mechanisms in place along with this relatively mild drug has worked wonders for me. In the years since restarting this drug as an adult I have made incredible professional and personal progress. I think too much unrealistic expectations are placed on this drug but it is not a magic pill. It works great for me used in conjunction with coping habits I have developed throughout my life. 
20$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/8/2014 8:11:35 PM$Reviewer: Jonothon, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$"I have taken this drug before and for me it did not work very well, i do not have ADHD that bad and honestly people don't know unless I tell them my biggest problem is I am easily distracted. When i took this drug the first month everything was going good my penmanship improved greatly along with vocabulary but about 2 months in I was very irritable and I just feld so much anger and hatred towards everyone. By the 3rd    month my mother had me seeing a psychologist because I beat my brother up pretty badly and was extremely aggressive, we later found out it was not me it was the medication. This drug can work but talk to your doctor if you notice some of the side affects listed on this site and I wouldn't pay attention to the ""Sever"", ""Less Severe"" part because it may affect you differently than it has others in the past."

My conversations I would keep repeating myself. My friends are amazed at the difference it has made since I started taking it. The Psych wanted me on the 40er but I dint like them at all. I take 10mg in am and 10mg at noon. Perfect dose for me. I think sometimes doctors want to give you a stronger dosage then you need. Kids on the 40mg seems to me like an awful lot. My BP is lower my pulse has slowed down, I can sleep better at night. It works great for me.

I started on 54mg and it wasn't enough so then I moved up to 72mg. That was way too much for me and I started freaking out. My heart was racing, I was running around in circles trying to get my energy out and it just hurt really bad. So then I took 63mg, and I have been fine on it, although I feel that it could help me focus more. But the worst thing about it is it makes me depressed. I was already sorta depressed before but when I take this, it makes it so much worse.

I was able to focus on tasks much better on either dose but I don't feel a come down from the 5mg pill. However, after taking this med once or twice a day for 3 or 4 days I had become easily agitated and somewhat agressive and I'm a pretty mellow guy. I only take it now if I have a task that requires my attention for long periods of time because I do have a problem staying focused but I'm not hyperactive and never have been.

The last 3 years I have gotten feedback from the teachers indicating minor behavioral problems with him such as, he has a hard time focusing, he cant sit still, he speaks very loud, and now in 2nd grade, his comprehension in reading was starting to reflect a problem. I never realized this at home because at home he read and comprehended his books just fine, however, these were books of his preference. I took him to the doctor who recommended this medication. Although it has only been a week, I have notice a change with focus and patience. I watched my son who never sat still, draw detailed pictures for an hour(He has never sat more than 10 min on anything other than video games). As far as school goes, he has been paying more attention in class and finishing his homework independently. My only complaint is that when this medication wears off, it really wears off and it seems like all of the controlled hyper was bottled throughout the day, then released at once but only lasts for a little while and doesn't interfere with bedtime. Overall this medication has helped and I now see a side of my child that I have never seen before and I am really pleased.

I started taking it in 5th grade and I'm now in my first year of college. Concerta has helped me to actually do homework instead of getting bored 5 minutes into homework and class. I have become an actual student and avid learner thanks to concerta. I think the new generic has made me break out because I used to have great skin but I can fix that. I would get used to the medication or I would realize it was too low of a dosage so my dosage is up to 54. Although through out the years the one bad side effect is that I would have upset stomach or weight loss but I was fine with that but the extreme side effect that I still fight when I don't take my medication is my overwhelming and complete ravenous hunger I get. I will literally eat everything in sight. So I feel a necessity to take my concerta everyday. But besides that I would recommend this to anyone wanting an ADHD medication.

What I can say is it has had several pro's along with some con's. Here is a list of Pro's and Con's of Generic Ritalin IR that I've experienced. 

Pros:
- Better Concentration (my ability to focus has moved to having 25% focus to 60% focus)
- Helps me be more awake and focused in class at school. 
- Grades have slightly improved in school.
- Doesn't last too long so I can take it around 6pm and still be in bed no later than 1am. 
- It's Cheap

Cons: 
- I sometimes crash and get really tired when the effects wear off.
- I sometimes have an empty feeling while on it, it's similar to depression but not a bad (it still sucks though)
- Hard to take since it doesn't last long, sometimes it lasts 2 hours other times 4-6. 
- I feel bored on it when doing things I normally enjoy.

Apparently concerta is no longer covered due to this cheaper pill. My 10 year old has been making strides since going from adderall (too much weight loss) straterra (ineffective) to concerta (working the best so far). Now with this new generic, he has a daily scowl on his face, simple arguments turn to serious tantrums and none of these things were present when on concerta. If this is just a generic version then why such serious side effects that the other didn't have. School is starting soon and playing with medications for my son is completely unacceptable. I will be meeting with my doctor to correct this week, but the fact that insurance can just change on a dime is pretty ridiculous.

Over the years I have switched medications back and forth until Methylin ER came out. It is an extended dose of methylphenidate and lasts 8 hrs. When taking this medicine, it does not affect my sleep even when the medicine is still active (in my system). The only downside is the overall effectiveness. It does not keep me as alert as MPH immediate release but there are alot of upsides. I am not moody or cranky on this medicine and I only have to take it twice a day instead of 4 times

I have increased the dosage a bit over the years, but as my life got more complicated the medicine became more of an issue. I am a serious athlete and have struggle with balancing this medicine, training, school, and my health. I find that there are several very serious problems  with this medicine.  Concerta dramatically decreases appetite to the point were i had to force-feed myself because my body was hypoglycemic and i felt faint after hard workouts. While the medz realyl helped at school, it is not long enough lasting so that i can effectively do homework at 9pm, but if i was to take a larger dose, i would never sleep.  some other side effects that have really hurt me are abdominal cramping, dramatically increased sweating and intense nausea, all of which are serious issues when you are a cyclist and training/racing in 90*F.  This medicine is fine if you arent an athlete, but if you are, you will find that its is helpful only if you can master/ work around its (potentially) serious side effects.  For me, this has been a deciding factor in my life, even though as of now im still a teenager. i hope that this review has been helpful, and that more reviews like this may motivate the company Concerta to develop a more athlete friendly medication

I ended up going to the ER thinking I was having a stroke.  The doctors said that was not a side effect of Ritalin, however, I see on WebMD that it is.  I was totally freaked out, I stopped it immediately and was terrified to try anything else. I also got very moody, I would space out on the way to work and get angry for no reason. Other than that, it worked well, I was focusing on housework and arriving to work on time. I just didn't like those side effects.

I couldn't sit still in class, I was always looking around, I was impatient, and I was SO bored; furthermore, three hour classes aren't easy to sit through. I was taking therapy, and my therapist told me that I had ADHD. THAT was a surprise. (Not really.) I had known for years prior. So, I went to my PCP, (Primary Care Physician) and told her what was up. I told her that the night before it had taken me three hours to only read a few pages out of my book, and that I needed to do SOMETHING. So, she prescribed me with Ritalin. The WONDER drug. It takes about 30 minutes to set in, and lasts about 4 hours. I could read and understand what I was reading, and also, I could sit STILL! Yes, COMPLETELY still! I love it so much, because if you only have to sit still for a couple of hours, just take half the dosage! It is amazing, non-addictive, and helps you to keep focused. I love it, and if you think you have ADHD, or ADD, ask your PCP about Ritalin. =)

Toward the last 6 motnhs that we had him on it, he became a very angry and violent young man.

I presently take the immediate acting pills at 180 mg/day,i.e.,40mg tid. I took Concerta 36mg/day for 3 years and it stopped working well so I was changed to Adderall, then to Dextroamphetamine. The Dextroamphetamine worked well, but it made my skin break out badly. If we can get the dose of Methylphenidate optimized I will stay with it. I am studying for the GRE so that I can go to graduate school. The medicine helps me to stay on task and keeps my mind from wandering. My ADHD manifests mostly as the inattentive type with comorbid depression, anxiety disorder and slight shizoaffective disorder. It has taken many years, various doctors, and many trials of different medications to get the correct mix and dosages. Thank God I am stable enough to go back to school and almost get the education that I had originally attempted. I  attended 3 years of medical school before I had to withdraw due to symptoms of my then undiagnosed ADHD. I am now 54 years old and until fairly recently have missed a diagnosis of ADHD all these years. It is only extremely evident that I have ADHD when I take the medications for it. I go from a good student to my normal excellent student status. The attendant symptoms of ADHD have crippled my chances for the lifestyle I had planned, but I can't gripe much because the pain they caused me drove me into the loving arms of my dear Lord and Savior and I am now one of His ordained and grateful ministers, a path I would not have taken without the pain from ADHD.

I was very torn about the decision to medicate my child.  I decided to try it to see if I saw any improvement.  The improvement was apparent immediately.  We have had to change his dosage (15mg 2x's daily), however now I am not the only one who sees how sweet and caring and wonderful my son is.  Before medicine, most people were aggravated with him and did not understand.  Now, he is very successful socially.  He never had a problem learning - the ultimate multi-tasker - but most children did not enjoy his company.  But now,he is invited to all the birthday parties and even has been star student!  This otherwise would not have been possible without this medicine.  The only issue, but is relatively insignificant, is the pills are in 10 mg and he has to take 15.  I have to be very careful in seperating the medicine and splitting pills.  But this is hardly a problem considering the success it has given my son.

I've been using this medicine for almost 6 years now because ritalin stopped working for me. At 54 mg, it lasts for about 8-10 hours. I have noticed that I do not experience hunger while on the medication, and also feel a minor absence of emotion(not as lively or active as normal).
Overall, it helps me concentrate and focus in on things, which is what it is ment to do."

It has really helped me over the years, and I highly recommend it! I tired a different drug at one point, and it didn't work at all - infact it seriously affected my memory, and after a couple of months I switched back to the Methylphenidate/Ritalin.

We have found that he has to take it with food or else it makes him sick to his stomach.  He seems to be doing just fine and he is taking 10 mg in the morning before school and 10mg at lunch.  I am very happy with how this is working for him.

For example I am not going to have the ability to ""take an afternoon nap""  --do I need to be more active at night, or start with a ""get up early, or a more difficult evening."" ---all in all, once you take it, you do not have controll af adaptation to work out a spacific schedule of that day.  However I am shure this form of long or sustained action would be of great benifit for children so they would not be embarresed by the fact ""report to the nurse"" every day, whitch could cause severe social problems with thier peers."
