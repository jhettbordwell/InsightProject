Started with 5mg back in 6th grade and has slowly increases dosage over the years.  She just recently went to 30 mg.  She gets good grades in school and is able to focus, but she notices that she is quieter in school while on it. The days she forgets to take it the ""real"" her comes out and she is talkative and fun to be around. She does, however, get ""C"" grades on those days.  Since switching to 30mg she has been moodier, more irritable, and she cries more easily.  These are heightened on the weekends when she usually sleeps too late to take it.  Her boyfriend says she has less emotion and doesn't have an interest in things.  She also has a lot of headaches.  I think    we may have to switch her medication.  It's unfortunate that in order to focus and do well in school she has to take something that keeps her true personality from showing.  Have others experienced any of these symptoms? I do have to say that children as young as 5/6 shouldn't be on this medication unless they are completely out of control in school.  And they should never need medication at that age just to get through homework. and it shouldn't be needed in order for them to do homework. Homework at that age isn't necessary. "

Although I give it great reviews, its more for what its not prescribed for than what it is.  I got A's and B's in Calculus 1,2,3, Physics 1,2, and Chemistry 1,2 sequence plus Diff EQ.  But, this drug will make you want to have sex all day and it is a distraction. Its almost painful how the mind will not deviate from this topic.  Also, when the drug wears off many people feel ""nervous"" but in my opinion this is when you can get the most work done because whatever you focus on will be worked on, you just have to ignore the depression or jitters.  Do not take this drug everyday!  I took 30mg capsule about once a week and the mind really doesn't stop racing for about a week.  You can sleep about 24 hours after taking a 30mg capsule, but the mind seems to remember how to function correctly well after that.
One final note is that when the drug does wear off, waking up is very very difficult, but sleeping is very enjoyable."

9$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/12/2010 10:09:53 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I started this medication three days ago.  Although it works just as well as shorter dose, I find that when it wears off, I have a drop off ... sadness is the best way to describe it.  The information that came with it did not mention this issue, but things I have read since mention the possibility.
10$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$3/3/2010 3:48:05 PM$Reviewer: GoGoSarah, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Love It! It is the miracle drug that I have always needed but when younger refused, if only I knew!  I can focus now more then ever. I once was not able to study with ANY noise around and now the TV can be on no problem.  I was on 10 mg twice a day and now I'm at 20mg.  I do not have any side effects other than great energy and the ability to focus on homework and work.  Its great it has improved every aspect of my life. I am careful of not taking it 3 hours before bed because it does take me about 5 minutes longer to fall asleep.  Drink a pop around the peek of my medicine working has helped an nervous feeling that I have.  With that in mind this helps me have all the positives and none of the negatives of the drug.  If your thinking about taking this drug, just do it becuase you will never regret this.

I am on 30miligrams a day and it seems that my body has been reacting different towards it.I think I'm getting immune to the drug, I find myself emotionally unstable,and lately I have really bad ticks,prickling and my thumbs and my focus has been off as well. It's scary because I really want to get off of it before things get worse, the only thing stopping me is school, I worry that I will be completely off focus and I wont be able to finish school. Today I didn't take it and i was in a great mood, normally when I'm on it I am depressed and guarded. I really don't know what to do from here.

But I think as parents we know them better then anyone else does and we know when they need a little help controlling themselves.Belieive me giving my son meds was the last thing I wanted to do. This medication helps him get through school and have good evenings at home. I have no complaints. He eats, he sleeps, and he isn't a zomby like the other medication vyvanse made him. He gets a good 7-8hrs out of it and slowly comes down in the evening. he's on 30mg and thats what seems to work for him.

It alters your personality as well as helping you focus and stay on track with your activities. It does not substitute for a good work ethic or diligence however, those skills must be trained not drugged.

This medicine does give an extreme drop off after approximately 6 hours after the dosage and is rather rough on one mentally.

Almost as if you were watching one channel of tv and suddenly someone else grabs the remote and switches channels without your control. 

I felt I needed to post because I read of so many VERY young children being given this powerful drug and I believe that discipline must first be attempted before jumping into giving your 5 year old drugs."

She started on Ritalin LA as her first medication attempt a few months later when school started.  She did good on it for a while.  We got up to 30mg daily but instead of the 6-8hrs promised, she usually got a good 5 usable hours prior to coming down.  She was arguementative about homework at night unless it was done right after school (which we started doing w/my mom).  She developed a very loud, annoying and very  disruptive verbal tic.  (Think throat clearing loud enough to hurt your ears within 3 feet of her).  So we are switching to Strattera to try it and we'll see.  The Ritalin was pretty good though, she complained of stomach pain sometimes and I think that was the medicine.  But overall, no weight loss (just smaller gains than prior on the growth chart but it remained consistant) normal growth rate, appetite was less so for lunch but good the rest of the day.  She did SO much better in school and her ability to concentrate when it was working was great.  An overall good improvement, but the tic thing was an overwhelming side effect that was detrimental to school and social situations.  I think the tic was brought out from stress, but, am not sure.  I'm hoping she will do good on the Strattera, but it bothers me there is no other way to treat this that doesn't involve potentially mood altering drugs.....
25$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/20/2007 3:39:20 PM$Reviewer: 3-6 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$4$4$5$My daughter has been taking this medication for about 6 weeks. The difference in her school performance is amazing. She can stay on task much better and her socialization has improved greatly. The only side effect so far is she gets very emotional in the late afternoon(crying/whinning), but this seems to be improving somewhat. We are pleased with this medication as our first ADHD med.
