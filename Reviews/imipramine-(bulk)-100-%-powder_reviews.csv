2$Condition: Other$8/14/2011 1:18:54 PM$Reviewer: BUTCHIE, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $2$2$2$"I am a single male 74 yrs (today) and have been taking imipramine 25mg, twice a day to help with a slight incontinence condition after the removal of my prostate about 7 years ago.
I was having a ringing condition in both ears recently, and ran out of this drug, and needed a new prescription from the original doctor.  I discovered, by accident, that when I was not taking this drug, my ringing in the ears ceased.
When I started in again with, the ringing returned.  I have since stopped the drug & will contact my primary dr. for further assistance.
This drug was really not as effective as I had hoped it would be.
