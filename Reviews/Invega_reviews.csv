In 2 1/2 years I was never told about my blood work nor was I refered to my primary care physician until I was at ""very high risk of a stroke or heart attack at any moment"". I filed a complaint with Janssen, the manufacturer, and the FDA for a bad and dangerous drug."

Non the less I hope not to take it any longer. I really dislike most side effects related to prolactin (even if it is what it makes it effective?).

I feel slight weight gain with Invaga 3mg and am experiencing suffocation feelings as I sleep.  Not sure I'll continue this medication much longer.

I'd stopped taking the pill before and lost 40 pounds before, so I know it is the Invega. I look forward to trying something else. Bad knees/back I can hardly walk...but great for the mood besides that!
5$Condition: Schizophrenia$9/12/2016 3:50:59 AM$Reviewer: wowinvega, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I wouldn't wish this drug on my worst nightmare. Pretty sure it destroyed my ability to have orgasms and gave me severe anxiety -uncontrolled movements, etc. Only when I stopped taking the drug and it had a chance to exit my system did this TERRIBLE anxiety subside! I feel like my brain has been re-wired, having zero interest in sex, or possibly even being able to reach climax impossible. Yes it did help with hallucinations, but NOT WORTH IT IN MY BOOK!

12$Condition: Schizophrenia$4/1/2014 10:20:28 AM$Reviewer: Micky Lagoski, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I was diagnosed with ""schizophrenia"" at the age of 35, so quite late. Invega (6mg) makes the voices in my head completely disappear or preventing them. Besides, bizarre delusions, like equipment that can read your mind, are eliminated. Taking Invega gives you a calm mind, thoughts don't ramble. Furthermore angry feelings  are decreased. Because of the gradually and continuous release of the medicine (new release system), one doesn't feel a drug boost - drugged. Now the side-effects : I need more sleep, sleep longer. I feel tired, less fit. Taking Invega for the first time might give you nightmares. And you might drool when you get higher doses. Sometimes a light headache can occur more frequently. When you stop with Invega (or Risperdal) I experienced a little bit of strange movements with tongue/mouth/jaws. This stopped after a few months. And I think I got heartburn (reflux problems) from it. Invega is very effective diminishing the positive symptoms. But I'm not sure about it, when it comes to negative symptoms. Invega makes me lazy, and less motivated - indifferent. I'm not sure about the following fact, but I think it's true : Risperdal gave me a bit of depersonalized feeling (increased it) - like there was a (virtual glass) barrier between me and the outside world (""cloud"" in my head). Invega, resembles Risperdal, but didn't gave me that depersonalization / derealization feeling at all!! I don't feel completely OK yet, but for now Invega provides me with the means to manage my life quite well, without help from other people. 3 mg Invega as maintenance dose is still quite effective. I still long for a complete recovery, although extremely rare when one has schizophrenia. "

She put me on welbutrin, but I was still terribly sick. I was really ready to give up, and go to a hospital. Then she started me on Invega 3 mg every night and I have NEVER felt this good, and I am 57, have had bp all of my life. I quit smoking several months ago, and have had two months of acute bursitis in both hips, so no exercise. So I have gained about 5 lbs, and think it's the combo of those three things. At this point, with the way I feel now, I can tolerate a little chubbiness!

In all the years I have had to deal with my Bi-Polar I have never felt more like myself then I do now (just without all the bad stuff!).  Oh, and a nice side effect is that I have lost 17 pounds which I put much more then that on when I was on the Risperdall.  This is a wonderful medication in so many ways!!

number of weeks, furthermore I don't get an unreal sense (depersonalization) which was the case with Risperdal. Unfortenately I got the following side-effects (discussed with my physician):

- weight gain (8 kilo's)
- sometimes strange expression around 
  mouth, stiffness
- tiredness/weakness, need more sleep
- intense dreaming, sometimes nightmares
- harder to breath through nose
- increase of ALAT blood values (80)
- dizziness after sudden activity

They are extreme fatigue, feeling anxious,very worried,depressed, numbness in hands and feet, sore muscles, blurry vision and frequent urination. I am not sure why this has occured. I am going through a really hard time also. My father is not feeling good at times and I get so upset cause he is very important to me. Also my hus band says he will be leaving me to go home to his country which will leave me in charge of finances and a new place to live. They say stress can cause depression. I am seeking the help of my psychologist and my aunts,Dad,cousins,Uncle and my sister.  I think also my sleep schedule is off. I don't go to bed until real late and sleep in alot. The weight gain from the invega worries me the most its about 40 pounds. My doctor told me Invega is not a weight gaining drug and that is not true bcause I WAS VERY THIN IN THE BEGINNING. My husband puts me down cause of my weight and that makes me depressed. I really was doing better when I was fourty pounds less. I had more energy then. But that was also before I got the news of my Dads serious condition and my husband saying hes leaving in the future. Im going to review the effectiveness of Invega and side effects with my Pschiatrist as soon as possible. I have appointment on June  6.

I am currently on 9 mg and am doing fantastic. I am very pleased with the effects of this medication and would recommend it to anyone suffering from bipolar disorder.

I've gone through about 7 doctors and even more medications.  The dosage that has finally been successful the past 2 years has been lithium, lamictal, and invega.  I used to take geodon, but my personal feelings of distress (more physical than anything else) made me beg for something else.  And then, whala!  A new drug called invega.  I soon was able to study for school better, my relationship with my then girlfriend now wife went to new heights; I even have been able to sustain a job for the past two years, all while buying my first home at 25 and a new car.  I truly attribute invega for giving me the stability to be myself again.

I'm not paranoid and my thoughts are not racing at all. I was on abilify, and I went out of the range of abilify and fell into a manic phase for several months. To say the least it was horrible. My current doctor put me on invega and I like the fact that I seem to be more sound and not manic or paranoid. However, now I am very sluggish and lazy. I feel depressed and I have gained a lot of weight.  My body just seems to me weighed down all the time. I also easily get indigestion now. I am also lacking focus and have a terrible time doing basic tasks like getting dressed of doing the laundry. I take it in the morning along with an anti-anxiety medication. I'm going to talk to my doctor about all of the side effects that I am experiencing to see if there is another medicine out there for me. It would be great if I could find a drug that gave me the balance and clarity of invega and the pep that I got from abilify. I had no weight gain when I was on abilify.

I have yet to experience any side effects with this medication.  I do, at times, suffer from insomnia, but still manage to sleep even if at odd times of the day or night.  The control-release substance makes it easy to take the pill if one cannot stick to a regulated daily time schedule for taking medication.  I always feel better, more alert and more focussed within one hour after taking this medication.  I have not experienced any additional side effects and am not certain if the insomnia is caused by Invega or if it is simply caused by life itself.

I was put on a drug called Serentil and was on it for over 25 years. I took 50mg per day. I was fine all my adult life then they stopped making the drug.  I tried everything-Geodon-Seroquel-Resperdal-Melleril and others.  Nothing worked.  Finally I changed docs and he put me on Invega-3mg-didn't work then 6mg-better but still not the best then 9mg-great.  No more voices and I don't have any side effects.  Only problem is over the 3 years of trying different meds I developed constant anxiety. My doc put me on Xanax ER.  Which may not be the best for someone who used to use drugs but, I haven't used since age 20 and I'm 47 now.  No side effects with Xanax ER either. And I still have slight anxiety but, I live with it.  As for the weight gain  on Invega I don't have it but, I have a very physical job so that may have something to do with it.  I also tried Depakote and gained 25# in 2 months.  The most important thing is no voices and I can live a ""normal"" life.  After 3 years of trying Thank God for Invega."

I noticed a twitching in my toes and fingers. This minor twitching has continued for the 6 months I have been on it.  I could not sleep when I first started taking it, but was hospitalized for 5 days because I couldn't sleep. I had a tough time trying to get to sleep and when I finally did sleep I sweated greatly!  The sleep problems went away and my behavior was fine for about 5 1/2 months. Now the sleep problems are startng again.  It seems I have slight problems breating and the tingling /twithching in my toes and feet are more severe.  I get real thirsty and drink lots of water.  It as if the systems in my body are shutting down and adrenalin is being pumped into my blood to keep my systems going which in turn keeps me awake.  The drug seems to calm me down but only for a short period of time after taking it. They just uped me from 6 mg to 9mg two days ago.  We will see how it goes.

I felt somewhat more manic than balanced,but, at least I was more positive in my thoughts/emotions. Than, because our society tends to think in terms of ""more is better,"" my therapist increased from 3 mg to the next level of 6 mg and, subsequently, I crashed and burned almost as immediately into the negatives as I had during initially taking the meds. After about 2-3 weeks of decreasing mood, depressions that I had not felt in a long time, I got word to him about the change and he told me to go back to the 3 mg. I did, but the negatives remained so I did the drastic and stopped altogether. However, I have been off them just 2 days, again with no change, but just retook my dose this second after reading all the rad success stories on here. I know meds act differently for each person, but I also know I am obnoxiously impatient and it is soooo difficult to wait out the meds before feeling better."
