This has been the best by far for the longest too. Still have to be diligent in eating big breakfast bc no Appetite during day n blood sugar can drop but dnt have the crash after its worn off which many others can. Feels like it stays working steadily as it should from about 630am to 330-4pm. Does make ya have to #2 some mrngs when it first starts to kick in but nothing crazy. Important to take as prescribed or your sleep and eating will go downhill quick

It almost quit working altogether over the course of the next couple weeks. The following month my doc put me on the 20mg XR twice daily and now I've not had any negative side effects except for occasional insomnia. I definitely recommend the XR over IR.

I found it useful to reduce the dosage every few days or not take one at all. My biggest disappoint is that the XR doesn't extend the release that much slower than the standard pill.

I'm not Hyperactive, but that was the only choice I was given. I am so glad that I was diagnosed and I was able to start this medication The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars for effectiveness is because I think that I should be on the next higher dose! Taking this medication has turned my life around. Before my ADD caused so many problems in my home life that my wife and I almost split up. I had a lot of problems finishing things that I started or remembering to do something because my mind would wander. Now I am able to stay on task and finish what I start. I only wish that I would have been diagnosed with this problem about 40 years ago. I wonder how it would have changed my working career?

I have tried Many drugs over the years. The only thing that would help me before Adderall was Cylert. But Cylert is no longer a choice. When I first took Adderall I couldn't believe it. How I felt, how I communicated, how my attention span increased along with my focus. I just wish this drug was available to me growing up, would have made my life much easier. I take 20 mills. most days. There are some days I will not take any. Other than a little restless at night, I have had no side affects. I take no other medication and feel good now while understanding things more clearly.

This medication has been a life savor. I don't take it often bc I don't need it all the time but my husband has pointed out that I am a different person when I'm taking it. I started reading and i think it helped with some depression I didn't realize I had. But I also up and downs of being tired and awake. I do notice the effects wear off quick. So I just take it a little later in the day.
11$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/2/2016 3:43:44 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$3$It works for me, my mood is more regulated, I can pay attention and I don't interrupt as much. However, I think it's important to realize that this drug won't make you a super student - It allows me the capacity to develop the habits of a good student that ADHD had prevented me from creating. I do find the XR doesn't last as long as promised, (currently on 20mg) so I take 5mg IR mid morning and 5mg in the afternoon. I rated it a lower usability scale, because getting a refill is a hassel. I have to pick up a physical paper prescription from my doctor's office to give to the pharmecy, then the pharmacy has to fill it and it takes longer because it is a controlled substance. It's a 2-3 hour ordeal sometimes. 
12$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/28/2016 3:22:38 PM$Reviewer: DanielleS, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$3$There is a honemoon phase with these. First effective. But once your body adjusts, there is an up and down feeling through the day. Tired, awake, tired,awake. The second issue is that they dont last as long as it supposed to. If you have an early start to your work week, dont bother taking them until late morning. Even after diet changes,exercise,supplements, and restful night sleep, It is still a luck of the draw how effect the XR will work that day.

I don't find that the 25 mg is ""enough"" because I am still having trouble focusing, getting organized, etc.  I see that the ""maximum"" dose is 30 mg of the XR.  I am scared that if I go to the 30 mg, and it isn't enough, where do I go from there?  I need to have a conversation with my doctor to troubleshoot this.  I would recommend the Adderall if you need it, but be mindful of the ""mood swings.""  I do find it to help significantly with anger, and I am not sleepy during the day. "

My Father is a phycologist specializing in children with learning disabilities so as a child i tried several different drug (names of which i do not remember) that failed to work for me or caused too many side effects. i had been taking a 30mg dose daily for about 5 years before i decided i wanted to wain off of it so no im on a lower dose. Although i have read that there are a rather large number of side effects i have only experienced a lack in hunger and occasion difficulty to sleep (only on days when ive been late taking it). overall this drug has helped me significantly in school and general day to day life although i am concerned about the lack of knowledge in the long term use of this drug.

There are naysayers who will question my post but, I am 55 yrs old and take two Adderall 25mg caps daily. No significant increase in BP ( it went up a bit only by 3 pts ) and no heart issues except I am a couch potato ! This is a "" wonder drug "" for me since being diagnosed by 2 psychologists and a doctor on 2002. The main reason for all the professional people was my doctor making sure I was not faking Adult ADHD just to get "" speed "" for no good reason. My doctor told me there is almost a steady stream of junkies trying to hustle him for dope ( meds that are not needed ). I had to work close with my doctor to get the right dose. Look at it like a lone window on one side a garage. You want to get "" inside "" the window, not before it or after it. ADHD meds no good if either or. That may explain why many parents "" freak out "" when their kid gets actually worse. Adderall may not be right for all persons. With my 49 yr old brother, Ritalin works best. Hope this helps."

For me it made it much easier to pay attention and complete tasks.. it makes everything seem so ""interesting."" I made much better grades in school. I was organized and well behaved. AS far as ADHD symptom, it pretty much eliminated them. However, Adderall has some side effects. I experienced rapid heart rate, higher blood pressure, extreme ""states of concentration"" (to the point where I could sit and do 500 math problems without stopping, without even wanting too), weight loss, and extreme mood swings. It made it impossible for me to sleep. It changes your personality and makes you extremely quiet. IT is VERY VERY addictive. If you miss a day, its hell.. I would be very tired, moody, and eat a lot. Its almost impossible to stop taking. Your brain learns to rely on it to function. Overall, for me, Adderall is effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD, however, you need to be aware of the side before you start taking it. Also as a child who was raised on the drug (my parents thought they were helping) I would never in a million years put my own children on Adderall. \"

He has ADHD and Ausperger's. WITH IT he can focus in school, his behavior is more age-appropriate, he is more successful in completing tasks, and in general is much more in control of his own actions.  WITHOUT IT the change is remarkable - he is hyper, impulsive, and spirals out of control. He knows how he wants to be, but gets frustrated as he is unable to help himself. I would reccommend this medication to anyone who's child  has ADHD, as I see no reason for the patient to struggle with the disorder and feelings of failure, shame, low self-esteem, etc. that go with it.  It's an appropriate treatment for ligitimate medical condition!  We monitor his dose very carefully, and don't give it after 10:30AM, so he has no trouble sleeping at night. Others have mentioned addiction issues. That won't happen unless one abuses their meds and starts down that slope.  I suggest that if it weren't Adderall they abused, it would be another substance, so please DON'T BLAME THE MEDICINE - blame the addictive behavior.(and I mean no disrespect, I truly empathize with those people and what they endured)

My parents didn't believe in this disorder nor treating it when I was young. Within the past year my wonderful physician and I have been trying many different adhd medications and finally found that Adderall XR works for me. It is an amazing medication making it possible for me to function normally finishing tasks which is huge for me because I have 3 small children with many many school and extracurricular activities. I no longer feel like I'm losing my mind thinking I was going crazy forgetting things starting many tasks at once and never finishing them not sleeping due to my mind never ""turning off""! I now know what it's like to be productive and have the ability to actually fall asleep without taking sleep aides! Strongly encourage this medication to anyone with this horrible disorder!  :o ) "

He is going to Wellbutrin and Tenex, and his entire demeaner has changed in a matter of days.

I have liked it a lot, but have suffered with skin side effects for years that are only now being attributed to this drug on the internet (i checked in late '06 for something else but found little info then, on skin rashes or what I was looking for. then.  I checked with my therapist just tonight, to see if he was hearing from other patients about picking at nails and skin on fingers, or about rashes on my arms, skin separation and bleeding under my skin. He has been hearing more lately about the picking of nails and skin on fingers.  If my skin issues end up being a bad side effect to adderall XR I'm going to be so angry at the medical profession for negligence because all of them have seen my skin.  I've even been sent by one, to an oncologist for cancer screening!  No doubt stimulant meds work for me and I'm grateful to have had access to them these past 12 years but doctors can no longer afford the time to learn/know what they should, in order to catch my ""severe allergic reactions""!

It worked really well, my grades were outstanding then the grade I had in the past & my conduct was super. But now I started to rely on it too much, I started thinking that the adderall was the only reason I've past highschool & that it wasn't me. I think that the adderall does all the work for me, I lost total confidence on myself if I dont have adderall to read or study or go to school. I feel dumb if I read, study, or go to school without adderall, this has affected me alot. My psychologist told me I'll would grow out of it & that I put the effort in my school work not the adderall. Well the thought of the adderall doing everything for me is still in my head, it grew powerful to think it's really true. Hopefully soon I will overcome that thought but now I just rely on adderall to basically do anything educational

I was just recently diagnosed with severe ADHD, moderate depression, and mild anxiety. I have known that something wasn't right with me since I was very little but I have parents who were in denial and too afraid of stigmas and what other ppl think about them to have had any help until now. With Adderall so far I have noticed that altho it definitely helps my concentration/focus/motivation it causes me to hyperfocus (act OCD) about certain things, my anxiety is worse, and I get mean and brutally/cruelly honest with those around me at times. I've also noticed that I talk to myself more often (which I've always done to a certain extent; like when I'm frustrated, doing math, or figuring something out)but now is more noticeable. I also have very bad dry mouth, an unquenchable thirst, and chapped lips. I can't go anywhere without a bottle of water and chapstick now. Otherwise, the sleep problems and loss of appetite went away after the first 3 days. Right now I'm in the 'deciding' phase trying to figure out if the benefits outweigh the side effects. I know that I have to continue some sort of medication along with my cognitive behavioural therapy because I can't function at normal expectations at this point otherwise but I'm uncomfortable with some of the possible side effects and the idea of becoming dependant. I have a history of street drug use(I self-medicated as a teen/young adult) and altho I have been clean for years I am always very careful and afraid of becoming that person again. Up until recently, I had only heard positive things about Adderall but now I'm not so sure. I guess I will finish off this month, talk to my psych more about it, and then go from there...

I was on Vyvanese for a little bit, but I really didn't like the side effects and felt it didn't do very much. I'm currently a sophomore in college and Take 30mg of adderallXR once a day. It really has been a godsend. My brain is not scrambled and I can actually organize and accomplish tasks at the correct due date! Something I could never do before, no matter how hard i tried. Yes i've lost around 20 pounds since starting Adderall my Senior year of high school (i've been on it around 2 years now) but I'm still at a healthy weight and I'm so much happier with who I am now. I know adderall is desired by many college students and therefor gives it a bad reputation, but Adderall really is a great drug for those of us that ACTUALLY have the disorder!

My ADHD is mostly impulsivity, but hyperactivity was also sometime problematic. Concentration was never really a problem for me. In school I often got in trouble for shouting out answers without being called on. Also before I started Adderall I almost always reacted before I thought, and said and did a lot things that I regretted later. Now I usually think out actions before I act, so I get in a less fights now. The only drawbacks to the medication are because it is extended release you HAVE to remember to take it early in the day or else you will be up like all night. Also  probably the only real side effect that bothers me is the apetite reduction. But I have found the best way to get around that is eat a good breakfast before you take it, and have some healthy snacks around the house for when the medicine wears off night so you can have something to eat. Overall I am very satisfied with Adderall xr and a pleasant surprise was if I woke up too late and didn't take it  I didn't experience any major negative consequences, but I did have to try a little bit harder to make sure I was thinking before I spoke.

I have been taking meds for ADHD for 28 yrs now.  I like Adderall XR because it lasted longer than the Ritalin, therefore I didn't have the up down up down feeling.  Adderall is a smoother transition too.  Of course it is not a cure all.  I still watch what I eat, work on time management, and do the occasional talk therapy.  I have also been the subject of multiple studies on ADHD since I was ""raised on Ritalin"" here it what I learned.  I am more prone to Alcoholism, I am more prone to ""falling in love"", I am more prone to acting out my anger.  Actions and feelings are easy impulses but my ADHD is not an excuse.  My mind understands, what has been so hard is to delay the impulse whether I am on medication or on a medication vacation.  I take 30mg of Adderall XR in the morning, 30 mg of ritalin in the afternoon, 80 mg of Straterra, and 300mg of Wellbutrin.  All this Medication in one day so I take med vacations in order to lower my tolerance.  Funny thing is I am only diagnosed with ADHD.  Believe me Doctors have tried to find some other condition bc ADHD usually is combined with ""something else"" but I am a classic ADHD case.  Getting meds for ADHD is easy now adays what is hard is taking responsibility for your treatment after your diagnosis.  I quit drinking, have taken the anger and time management classes, and married a man I respected.  I also don't use my ADHD as an excuse in my professional life, my employeers don't need to know my personal life.  Finally Yoga has had a great affect on my ability to focus, HUGE.  I hope the people who are ADHD make it clear to their Doctors that the H means hyperactive NOT manic.  I have experienced too many non ADHD doctors who are ready to label and prescribe the newest ""condition"".  I don't have much respect for the medical communities understanding of ADHD.  All I know is that the medication is only one part of the equation, its the easy part.  Good luck i hope i helped."

93$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$6/29/2011 11:28:10 AM$Reviewer: trailrider, 45-54 Male  (Patient) $4$4$5$I've probably lived my entire 49 yrs with undiagnosed ADD, but over years of building defense mechanisms to compensate, it evolves into issues that don't fit the traditionally accepted symptoms. I was never hyperactive, don't currently have difficulty reading or focusing on specific tasks. I do however, tend to hyperfocus, don't like interruption and don't transition very easily. I also don't like a lot of activity and noise as that affects my ability to focus. At times, my mind is being barraged with a bunch of external and internal stimuli. It becomes too much and I will get irritable and react negatively to my family. It's not the way I feel inside, but it's all right on the surface trying to defend my focus. It has evolved into a degree of anxiety and depression about the inability to soften the impact of stimuli. I was starting to get more and more down, more withdrawn, and dark. I tried some of the anxiety/depression medication like Zoloft (a year and a half), but I felt more anxiety from them. I am not sure the Zoloft ever worked for me at all. I finally decided one day to try my daughter's Adderal (she also has ADD). The difference was significant. 80% of the negative stimuli dissipated and was replaced with positive feelings... confidence, patience, peace. Everything became more manageable and I felt a lot more normal. So after a couple months on Adderal XR25, it is working pretty well... not perfect, but a lot better. I also tried Focalin and was initially prescribed Vyvanse. The Vyvanse laid too heavy on me and I felt out-of-body. The Focalin was better, but the Adderal XR25 seemed the best fit. For adults, symptoms and issues around ADHD don't fit the traditional. The psych said adult ADHD is in the process of being redefined by the medical community.

I hated it. This drug has changed my life. I never thought I had anything wrong with me medically despite my crippling inattention and mild bipolar depression. Then a friend gave me an adderall, and I wanted to get a scrip for it because it was such an improvement over my regular life. But my doctor wanted me to get tested for ADD... I really didn't think I'd turn up positive, but I did, as well as the previously mentioned bipolar. So instead of giving me adderall IR right off the bat, he wanted me to try XR. It's been perfect. I never feel drugged at all, it feels totally natural, and it defeats my regular daily depressive feelings and gives me energy. I can now follow my dreams and passions with an un-stifled hope and confidence.

I am so focused and awake, it has saved my full time job and has allowed me to work a second job and be successful at both. I can concentrate so much better! The only problem is that I've learned I can't take the second adderall after noon or I won't sleep at night. I also learned that I can't take 2 every day like the doctor prescribed. I have to either take 1 a day and skip the weekend, or 2 every other day or I will get agitated easily and the withdrawls from coming off of it for a couple of days is horrendous! It makes me feel like I have the flu or something. It is very addictive because of the effectiveness-concentration and being wide awake. Overall, I would recommend this drug to anyone with ADD, but would also recommend being closly monitored by your doctor, as this drug can be very addictive.

I had adult ADHD so my mind would try to focus on multiple things at once and it would overload. For the first few months the medication was great.

The last year and half has gone from good times to a living hell. I upped my dose from 20 mg to 20 mg and 15 mg in the afternoon. That is when the living hell began.

It made me feel like the world around me didn't matter. The only two things I cared about were my grades and my girlfriend. Everything else was non existent in my mind. I started losing friends left and right, I became a lot less sociable, and my parents knew something was up. When my only other friends I had told me what they noticed, the medication made me not believe them and I then became very paranoid.

I thought everyone around me was an enemy looking to make my life miserable someway or another. My anxiety levels skyrocketed and I always had my head on a swivel. It was a terrible way to live life. I even started thinking my girlfriend was up to no good when she wasn't around me so I started becoming clingy to her.

Thank God I stopped taking this medication. I found self worth in myself again and I my ex friends became friends with me again. Everyone in my life noticed a great difference and that's when I realized I needed to stop taking this medication.

My advice, ""DON'T TAKE THIS MEDICATION UNLESS YOUR ADD/ADHD IS RUINING YOUR LIFE."" And if you have to use this medication, make sure you use it only on the days you need to concentrate. Your life can spin out of control if you take this medication for an extended amount of time in my experience."

I was on Adderall XR for about 3 years. It did help me focus but the side effects were awful. I really found out after I went off of the drug, which wasn't hard at all for me. I was off medication completely for 3 years and went back on Ritalin this time. I now only take 15mg of Ritalin as opposed to 25mg of Adderall and I can focus enough to do my work and still go to sleep at night. For those of you who have ADD I (not hybrid or hyperactive) and are experiencing side effects I definitely recommend trying other forms of stimulants. It might take some time to find the right match (like finding the right girlfriend or wife) but it is so worth the effort.

I am a bit more serious through the day, but it doesn't bother me because I'm at work anyways. If you are on a too high dosage you will get ticks, shakes, or difficulty breathing. DO NOT TAKE THE GENERIC! The salts are different in the medication and cause it to release differently. When I took the generic I had every negative side effect, as if i was taking a dosage too high for me.

He is now taking 10mg of Adderall XR every morning.  His focus and concentration both at home and at school has improved dramatically.  Only side effects are occasional nightmares...but only if he's overtired.  He'll wake up a few hours after going to bed and with about 30 minutes of random crying.  This has subsided the longer he's on the meds.  It was happening at least once a week, to now only once every 6 weeks or so.  His appetite is still good, although he looks very thin.  
Since watching my son's improvements on Adderall XR, I am now currently going through an ADHD evaluation to take care of it for myself.  I've had it my whole life, runs in my family...but was never treated.  Due to that, I could never keep a job or even finish school (no matter how many times I tried to go back).

The negative is, trouble falling asleep, then trouble getting up in the morning.  For a teenager, he doesn't get enough sleep.  On weekends, he'll sleep till 11 easily.  He's missed school because he can't get out of bed.  Its almost like his body crashes every 10-15 days.  I don't know how to fix that.  He likes how he feels when he's not on the medicine (he has more energy).  He knows how much it helps him concentrate.  It definitely makes him moody and intollerant at times.  But without it - that's just exaggerated too.  Adderal XR is a necessary evil i'm afraid.  Tried many others before sticking with Adderal XR.

It has helped me lose 80lbs in 18 months which I am fine with! It makes me very irritable and short tempered, and if I do not take it for 2 days I feel worthless. If I miss one day, it's not terrible because I still feel it from the day before. I have never gotten the greatest sleep on it, but have learned to deal with it. I've found it to be extremely addictive and I would NOT recommend it. I have a complete love-hate relationship with this medicine. Without it though, I'm not sure I would've graduated high school on time, and am now currently about to graduate college in may. I have an 18 month old son and I did NOT take it during pregnancy, and I did start taking it immediately after he was born, due to lack of milk anyway. I was not able to breastfeed. It has helped tremendously with the ability to keep up on the demands of a toddler, school full time, and recovering from major back surgery. Downsides for me based on personal experience are: dry mouth, excessive sweating, dizziness, sleepless nights on occasion, COST if not covered by insurance, heart palpitations, extremely tight back muscles in the evening, teeth gritting, and anger/frusteration. It has helped me in so many ways, but also has many side effects, and due to the fact that it is so addicting, I wouldn't recommend it to people under 21.

I believe it is a wonderful drug, It has helped me and my son. Thank you

I've been taking it for 3 years now & it has changed my life. I am not addicted to it, I don't take it when its unnecessary (i.e. no work/school/studying). The only thing that bothers me is that people who don't take it & dont understand just assume its bad for me, which makes me feel like im taking speed (which I guess it kind of is), not to mention the movie ""requiem for a dream"" (dont watch that lol sometimes I feel like the old lady). Anyways, does anyone think they should be worried that its a legal version of speed? Or do most think it is truly for medical purposes & unlike illegal drugs, there is a positive reason for it?"

It has changed my life, although I understand that everyone is different and reacts to everything very differently. You have to take that into consideration when reading these reviews. 

I always felt like there was something not right with me until my Phyc. suggested the Adderall. First I was put on a  Regular Dose of 10mg in the morning and a 10mg in the afternoon (which I hated cus I'm terrible at taking my pills), so we switched to 20mgXR. Things has changed drasticly. I can focus, Im not chronicly late anymore, which then disposes of my road rage. My work is off the charts (Im a hairstylist), because I can really focus and listen to my clients. Before I always had a million things running through my head and couldnt get my shit together. I obvioulsy have more energy, and I do have to say that my anxiety and depression have lessened. I think eveyone gets anxious, its just a part of life, it doesnt mean you have something wrong with you.

So side effects, signifigant weight loss, 12lbs since November, Im not complaining. I do have loss of appitite during the day and def am hungry when I get home. I notice my mouth is always dry. But I have no problem getting to bed. And I really don't have dependency issues, some times on Sundays I don't even take it.

So that's that, It works for me, may not work for you. But you have to try things to know how you'll react!"

The effect is steady throughout the day rather that having the ups and downs of regular Adderall.  I have no side effects with XR whereas with the regular version I felt like I was on speed.  It really helps that I only have to take one XR in the morning.  Like many an ADDer I have problems remembering things.  More often than not, I would forget to take my afternoon dose of regular Adderall, or if I did remember I would find that I had forgotten to bring the meds me.  My prescription drug provider used to charge $10 per month for both versions of Adderall.  Now they charge $10 for the regular and $260 for XR.  My doctor is filing an appeal, but if it does not work it may be worth it to me to bite the bullet and pay through the nose so that I can stay on the XR."

Before that, I took Dexedrine.  With the exception of ages 18-21, I took some form of stimulant since age 13.  

Adderall is highly addictive.  I feel it has ruined my life.  I loved the euphoric feeling and weight loss side effects, but it was so addictive I broke down and took it during my last trimester of pregnancy and now I fret it has caused a disproportionately small head size in my11-week-old daughter.  (weight and length are off the charts but head is only 50th percentile, and was only 25th percentile at birth)

It was also so addictive I quit breastfeeding at 5 weeks to go back on the meds.

Now it's causing dry mouth to the point of receding gums and ruining my teeth, and I'm still considering going back on it.  (when I realized the affect it was having on my dental health -- I quit taking it, and that was 2 days ago.  The fatigue from the withdrawal is crushing.)

I wish my parents had never started me on these meds.  

Please, parents, do not start your kids on these meds.  Their ADD can be an asset -- there are different perceptions of this 'disorder'.  They are better at multitasking and can hyperfocus when they are truly passionate about something...

The drugs are a gateway to a nightmare.

I probably do have ADHD but I am convinced that my use of Add over 2 years contributed to my life spinning out of control. I became impulsive, sometimes agressive, etc; started drinking excessively to ""come down"", mind was moving too fast to deal with life issues. Be wary of statement on this website that benefits should outweigh side effects! For me, it was great for a while but wow, did it help me mask life and land in a ditch (literally as during one episode I totalled my vehicle). Remember that the generic name is ""amphetamine"" and this is, for me, just a nicely packaged pharmaceutical called ""speed"". I'm now dealing with life on life's terms; not perfect, but drug free and I pray I never go back!  Again, rigorous honesty!"

When she comes ""down"" from the meds, she really cycles out of control.  We just had our last and final episode of the med...she totaly ""wigged out""....worse than the previous hysteria...all about cleaning her room.  It took my husband and me 45 min to calm her down.  She was mentally and physically exhausted.  We were terrified by what we witnessed.  She's only been off the med since Sat., but so far she's feeling better.  I'm scard to try something else, afraid of what those side effects might be.  We also read about Adderall being taken off the Canadian market because of severe side effects, including death.  Unfortunately, this didn't warrant its removal from the US market and I only learned about this AFTER the troubles my daughter went through."

I have been taking Adderall XR for over 3 years.  I am now considering changing to a different ADHD med.  Here's why:

When I filled my prescription for DAW (dispense as written) name brand Adderall XR, the pharmacist showed me that all the pills in the name brand bottle were all imprinted with M. Amphet. Salts - just like the generic. She even opened a new bottle, to show me that Walgreens wasn't trying to screw me over.

I called Shire and they said that the FDA approved Shire imprinting the name brand capsules with either ADERALL XR or M. Amphet. Salts and that as long as my prescription came from a name brand bottle that said ""Shire"" that I was taking the same name brand drug I've been taking all along.

I HIGHLY doubt what I've been taking for the past few days is regular name brand Aderall XR. I have been experiencing headaches, as well as, tight/clenched upper back muscles, tingling/numbness in my face and pressure behind my eyes. I also feel like I'm on something - I never felt like I was on something when I took name brand Adderall XR before!

I called Shire again and again they told me that as long as my prescription came from a bottle that said ""Shire"" that I was taking the same name brand drug.  Shire is lying."

I have severe ADHD that runs in my family. My brother has ADD and my sister has hyperactivity without the inattentiveness that she finds highly adaptive. My nephew (brother's son) took Adderall with great results for many years. Although I have had a lifelong history of ADHD (and was in special ed) I had always been misdiagnosed. I won't even go into the crazy things I was labelled with. Despite such a grim prognosis I was able to complete grad school with a 4.0 average at USC and obtain a professional license in health care. When I tried to obtain meds for ADHD this was used against me and I was told that I could not be this successful with severe ADHD and was even labelled bi-polar by the chief of neurology due to my hyperactivity which has become worse when I turned 50. Finally a colleague prescribed Strattera which not only made my sick it also gave me nightmares. Next was Concerta which worked great but gave me such severe dry mouth that it destroyed my mucous membranes. Recently I switched to Adderal. By this time I was saying my prayers. It works great! I had mild dry mouth that was self-limiting and am on top of my game. The best thing is the improve social skills due to < impulsivity and the improved concentration. I am a new woman! Thank you shire. I take 20 mg QAM and 10 mg in the afternoon. It also decreases my PTSD symptoms. From reading the posts my experience appears unusual and I hope it encourages adults.

Adderall XR is the best hands down.  Strattera didn't work at all and the concerta was ok but didn't last 12 hours like it's supposed to, plus my liver enzymes tested high on it.  Vyvanse gave the worse sides.  My eyes were always bloodshot and I was always paranoid.  I feel at ease and can focus and concentrate for long periods of time at school and work.  For people that legitmitally have ADD/ADHD like me, this drug works wonders, provided that you take it properly and DO NOT crush the beads and snort it or inject it.  It is meant to be taken orally and create and acheive a steady baseline level so there aren't as many highs and lows throughout the day.  One side effect I have found out to be negative is that it takes me 2 hours to fall asleep at night.  Aside from that, I now live a normal life and excel in both school and work.

Adderall has worked very well for me. Some of the benefits for me are increased focus, ability to effectively process information and form and express coherent thoughts more effectively. When I am on my medicine, I find it easier to complete tasks, whereas without the medication, completing even the easiest of tasks (like unpacking groceries) is difficult because I get sidetracked. When I am not on my medicine I tend to exhibit a lot of impulsive behaviors, but on my medicine, I am better able to think before I act, so to speak. Another benefit is that I am not bored as frequently. One obvious negative side effect is loss of appetite. I lost a lot of weight in the first year or so of being on Adderall. I could easily go for a day without eating. I just didn't look healthy. Some of my family members and teachers thought I had become anorexic and were getting worried. After I graduated college, I went off Adderall for about a year and hated it. I gained back the weight I had lost plus more because of nervous/bored eating, and I struggled in school (in my masters program), at work, and some of my relationships with others suffered. I have been back on Adderall XR for about 3 months now and am much happier with life in general. I just feel more balanced and in control of myself, which is nice. I have noticed decreased appetite, but to a MUCH lesser extent than in high school and college. Some of the negative side effects I have always experienced while on the drug are decreased sex drive (although that has improved), dry mouth, and what I call ""hyper-focus"" - the inability to switch from one task to another. The effectiveness of AdderallXR obviously varies from person to person, as do the positive and negative side effects. THough I have had some negative side effects, my overall experience with AdderallXR has been VERY positive."

Take a nap or a walk.  There are actually real medical reasons to use it.  If your not eating then make a note to remind your self to eat, if you have dry mouth drink more fluids.  If you can't sleep try a snack before bed or a warm bath or maybe you're dose is too high.  You shouldn't go OCD from it. I've been misdiagnosed for over 3 years and this is year 4 and I've started a new dr and the generic form of Adderall XR and since I've never taken anything else I can't compare it with the label or any other type stimulant.  I've started on 10mg and will be on 20mg next week.  I can sleep, eat and have been slowly teaching myself to slow down and pay attention to what I'm doing and to listen better.  It also has been on the market for years and the side effects are small compared to some you may not even know exist until later. :)

208$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/17/2009 8:41:45 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$"Have been on this medication only a month, but the difference is VERY noticeable. Have narcolepsy in addition to ADHD, and as an adult who has never been treated or diagnosed until recently, didn't know my issues were so severe. My psychiatrist recommended it and I take 10mg per day. Since beginning it, I have less distractability, more focus, more concentration, easier time remembering tasks, not losing things anymore or misplacing things.
The few things that have slipped away are the racing thoughts, the negative outlook on all things in life, and my inability to sleep through the night. I am glad they have. I can concentrate more. However, it has also taken muscle spasms away and now I can feel every bit of my fibromyalgia pain. So in conjunction with Adderall XR, I take Lagnasil (Lamotrygiene) and have a muscle relaxer (Xanax) which helps with the pain at night. Overall, my cognitive reasoning and function has VASTLY improved. If you suffer from ADHD, I hope you give this a try and see if it works as well for you."

I have no side effects. I sleep better than before, have a regular appetite, no dry mouth, no mood swings. I take only 10 or 15 mg per day. I'm sure I could take more for better concentration and to stay on task easier, but I take the minimal amount of medication I need to enable me to use the other coping skills I have developed. This drug should be used to help ADD symptoms, it's not a cure. We need to learn skills to deal with our ""handicap"". Taking medication can take away enough of the noise and chaos to allow us to learn coping skills. For some who have described negative symptoms, try cutting back a little at a time, it may be a little harder to concentrate but it may eliminate the negative effects and still give some positive relief for ADD.

At first it worked amazing. I was up nice and early in the morning and it kept me going throughout the day. At first I noticed I had to eat. After a few months on the drug, I starting getting headaches when (I realized) the drug was wearing off. I started on the regular release tablets at 10mg, started taking 15 mg XR, now I am on 30mg XR twice a day. I have built up an incredible resistance to the drug...but even if I don't take it I am a total wreck. The last few months I've been very depressed, anxious and just plain old down in the dumps. I don't even want to leave the house. I am thinking about switching to a new drug, but I am nervous it will not initially help me like adderall once did. Very, very addictive drug. I would not recommend it to anyone who couldn't deal with the jitters, loss of appetite and difficulty getting to sleep. But it does eventually go away. I just don't recommend it for long-term use.

At first it was good especially the whole weight loss thing. But then I just started feeling like I was on crack. (even though I know, it pretty much is crack) I became so immune to the positive effects like being able to concentrate. But the bad side effects always stayed. I was nauseous all the time, I couldn't eat and became very underweight, my mouth always felt dry no matter how much water I drank. Eventually I would dread taking the medicine when I woke up because I knew what I was in for. My doc recently switched me to Vyvanse which works just the same, but without the extreme crash and extreme bad side effects. I will never get back on Adderall, ever!

When I take 20mg before class or before I go to work, I feel like a completely different person--in a good way. I do not take it everyday, unlike some people. I take it when I know I'll need it-like at school. One day, I forgot to take the medicine before classes and I could not focus one bit. I never realized how bad my focus is until that day. People all around were talking and I could not get my mind out of all the conversations. When I take the medicine and people are talking around me-I can block them out and focus like nothing else. My side effects include dry mouth, canker sores from dry mouth, little appetite.

I do know that some people truly do need it though. If you do want to come off of it I would suggest your Dr. slowly taper you off of it. And ask for a rx of Provigil or Nuvigil to help you stay awake and alert during the day. These two drugs are intended for alertness and narcolepsy. They just aren't an amphetamine. Hope this helps if you do wish to stop adderall. Happy health. - B. Anonymous

As far as my ADD is concerned, it works wonders. However, I get extremely fixated while doing things (such as browsing the web and cleaning) and will often do them for over 5 hours without stopping. It has caused me anxiety, a misdiagnosis of a heart mutation due to my high heart-rate (caused by the medication), teeth grinding, and frequent sleep problems. Also, the withdrawal symptoms are very severe and I often can not even stay awake during the day if I do not take it. Overall, the benefits do outweigh the side effects and I feel that I will be continuing to take this medication for a very long time.

I started with Ritalin and that didn't help all. I was switched to 20mg twice a day. That worked well but it hit quick and wore off quick. Especially, I have a 20 month old and sit at a desk working on a computer all day. So, for the last 2 months I am taking 30mg XR twice a day. It's working great. I was on unorganized, missing dead lines and just would daydream and go on the internet. Taking the Addreall really helped with that but I was still having a little anxiety, worries and a little tense. Not a lot but I still felt it. The Dr. gave me Cybalta 60mg once day or instead the Cybalta, try 1mg of xanax. The 2 combine has given me energy, focus and I am in a good mood with basically no worries went I get home and can enjoy my time with my son. Everybody has to try to find their own combo of prescriptions, since everybody's body's make up is different. It took me abbot 6 months before I found this combo and the right dosage.

I didn't notice any improvement for attention and had side effects such as increased depression and feelings of hopelessness, lack of sexual desire,and tiredness. The depression issues are what helped me to see that Adderall wasn't working for me. I am already taking 200mgs of Zoloft and was doing well on that, so at first I thought maybe I needed to  increase the Zoloft. After another day of falling asleep after taking the Adderall and having had a full nights sleep, I decided it had to be the Adderall. Stopped taking it for 3 days and felt more energetic and depression lifted. Will keep communicating with the Dr. until I get it straight--or me straight!! :)

I began taking the 30mg pills but suggested being lowered to the 20mg pills because I had many of the symptoms listed. I lost a lot of weight, as well as my appitite, and became very irritable. I also developed annoying little habits like tapping my foot and clicking my tounge uncontrolably. But overall, this drug has done wonders for me. My first year of 8th grade I failed miserably. I was written up over thirty times that year as well. I could not concentrate no matter how hard I tried, and I got in trouble so much because I was so hyper and bored. I was prescribed Adderall XR the next year and I did a complete turn around. I made honor roll and maintained an A average throughout the whole year. My behavior also change. I had a better attitude and did'nt get in any trouble at all. I have just graduated high school, and thanks to Adderall, I continued to make great grades and control my behavior throughout my high school years as well. I was even accepted into a great university and given a scholarship. Adderall changed my life. I am convinced that I would not be where I am now without it. It does have some negative effects, but the advantages were much more visible(in my case at least).

I've had trouble with listening, paying attention to detail, getting things done, anxiety, stress, eating disorders etc etc the list goes on. I come from a family who cares for me tremendously so it has nothing to do with them..So, before I started taking this it was hard for me to even get out of bed in the morning & carryout my day. I was diagnosed with bulimia/nervosa & depression so I take a combination of Prozac & Adderall and it has changed my life 100% and for the better. I wake up with energy, take on the day, I dont binge eat nor vommit because with the adderall suppressing my apetite I do not get the urge to eat when im bored. However, it is easy to maintain a healthy diet and eating regularly. For the first time I am making A's in my classes, which NEVER happened in highschool & I enjoy life so much more. The thing I really had to get used to was harnessing my energy. I would start a ""project"" and not want to finish it until I was done but i would really need to do homework or something of greater importance. I had to train myself to prioritize and make schedules, something that comes so easily to others. But, once I re-trained my brain how to function to be successful it really helped me get through life. Like I said, I'm finally making good grades AND getting to class (and everywhere else) on time. I'm not sure if I reccommend adderall to kids under the age of 15 unless theyre morally responsible but I definitely recommend it to young-adults & so on."

It helps concentration all day.  In my experience, it should not be taken after 11:00 am because it may cause insomnia.  This medicine also decreases appetite, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on the patient.  I am not overweight, so the appetite supression became a slight problem for a while, but the positive effects outweighed the negative effects by far.  Once I had been taking it for a while, I was able to eat normally again, but people who are under-weight should be monitored in order to make sure they are eating enough.  Another thing about this medication is that it is very addictive.  It has been effective for me for the past 4 years, but I am unable to function normally without it.  People who are prescribed Adderall XR should be aware that they may become dependent, and if they are to discontinue taking it, they should definitely taper their dosage down fairly slowly.  Overall, Adderall XR has been an incredible improvement for my concentration.  I believe, however, that it should not be administered to young children because of it's strong effects.  If it is needed for a child, they should take the lowest effective dose.

I managed to get through highschool and 2 years of college despite the trouble and chaos i got myself into. about a year ago i started taking adderall for my ADHD again. the first 8 months were great. my racing thoughts became more organized and i was able to prioritize my tasks in order to complete them. If you look at other posts listed here the users of 1-6 mo will have more positive feedback than those of long term. its been about a year and im trying to get myself off of this. i have started to experience withdrawal symptoms in the morning and evening. theyre terrible. i could avoid these symptoms by upping my dose but ultimatly that would be masking rather than solving. which is what so many people do. the drug is seriously effective for adhd but i would warn on dose amounts to be sure your not masking harmful dependency signs or the outcome in the longrun will be way worse than any adhd symptoms you thought were bad."

In the begining we tried a different medcation that was not lasting long enough for him. So we tried Adderal and over night we saw a big differance in him. He was about to concentrate through the whole day. I noticed that he would get emotional in the afternoon.  The way we fixed this was to make sure he had a snack in the afternoon to re-boost the medication.  The medication is time released right? so the reason for mood swings in the afternoon is because lack of protein in the body.  Try this and you should see a differance.

I was keeping my room clean and doing everything I was supposed to do because of the medication. I was more focused and serious about things, but I lost friends. I was no longer myself anymore. It took everything people loved about me away. I recomend to think before you use this drug and to be careful if you have important things coming up. The side effects totally changed who I was and what I could do. The friends I told about this were the ones that helped me when they started to notice things and that helped. When I finally stopped it took awhile for me to fully lose the side effects. Keep up with your side effects and make sure you think is it better for me to stop or keep going. In my case the bad totally wiped out the good.

I was started on 20mg of Adderall xr, then went to 25 mg xr, and now I take 25mg xr in the morning around 6am, and then an Adderall IR, 10mg, around noon to one p.m. I think Adderall works great, the problem I had was that even though it is an XR formulation it seemed to wear off around noonish everyday. I was never able to get ""all day coverage"". In February my doctor added the 10mg IR ""booster"" and it has worked great ever since. He told me that every one's body metabolism is different and some get longer coverage than others. This is what worked for me. I was worried about sleep issues being on this dose, the amazing thing is I actually feel like I sleep better since being on this medication. When I lay down to go to sleep I don't have a million and one things floating through my head like I use to. It's like the background ""white noise"" is gone. My thoughts are so much clearer now and I can actually get things accomplished instead of 20 things half accomplished. It's too bad people abuse this drug, it's makes it more difficult for people who use it for legitimate medical purposes to get it. All of my other medications I can get a 90 day supply in the mail. With Adderall I have to go to my doctors office every month and pick up my prescription in person. Other than that absolutely no complaints. Good luck to all."

Just a totally different child. I thought Omg, why did I waite so long to take him in to be treated!! Then, gradually it got horrible! He started having what I called ""These Fit's"" He would get so upset at the drop of a dime.On the way to the psychologist one day, we were leavin well he wanted a cheese sandwich and we were out of bread.The only bread was end pieces. Well he went CRAZY! Kicking, screaming, hollaring, ""I hate you! I wish you were dead! Nobody likes me anymore!"" It was as if the exordist had entered my little angles body. We got to psych. and it was only once I told him, that he was able to settle him down(after a 2 hour drive there)and he also got him a cheese sandwich. I later found out from his pediatrician that this was a really bad side effect of the meds.Except for the mood swings, outburst the medicine was great. But we had to switch to Concerta 18mg. cause the mood swings got worst and worst. Now, he is my little angle again. That just goes to show you, it is trial and error. Some meds work better for some people than other's. Hang in there, cause somewhere down the line, one will work the best!!!

As for the loss of apatite I just decided to get more carbs protein all the calories etc, more in just a 1-2 meal's a day instead of having 3-4 ( yes i love to eat and I am a cook) But for the most part the loss of apatite will dissapate once i get myself, used to the medicine.

Now as for how it helps me out has been great, I have alot more focus, I don't feel that my mind is running around at 1000mps in 800 different directions. I also get that euphoric feeling of happiness, and sometimes catch myself spacing out to the clouds sometimes, or just good enjoyable moments that i prolly couldn't stop myself to see.

Overall I enjoy this medication, sometimes yes i get mad that i only get 4-6 hours of sleep but I am learning to manage my sleeping times to were it cycles just right, and now that i have been on it for about 10 days i am starting to actually sleep 1-2 hours more a night as long as knowbody calls me or etc. (before i was a heavy sleeper now I can't even take naps :( i will miss you naps.) but now i dont have to string my alarm clock across the room to force me out of bed and to turn it off etc cause before i would just sleep through it"

I personally refer to it as Theta World.  Just east of Narcolepsy and due south of ADHD type 1.
Adderall XR has worked well to fill a void that was missing in my quest for balance.  It provides a ""kick"", of sorts, to the mind and body.  I find it spurs mental motivation, which in turn, the body responds to quite well.  I take 1 in the a.m and 1 in the mid afternoon.  This seems to get me through to the early evening. Note:  There is some irrability experienced, in my case, as the dosage fades.  Foretunately,I discovered Strattera long before adding Adderall XL, which actually works very well as a counter measure.(Read my review on Strattera).  Although, I should add that Adderall XL does not have the crash that I experienced on some of the more popular ""stimulated"" drugs.  Nor do I feel a ""pull"" of dependency.
That being said, I did inadvertently take a short ""Holiday"" from the drug, and noted  a definite drop in mood towards depression accompanied by an increased lethargic feeling. A withdrawl effect. Not dire, but to be noted, nonetheless.

Increased my ability to focus on important details, caused a 25lbs weight loss in 6 weeks..I looked anorexic because I'm tall and slender as it is.  If I drink coffee during the day I'm like a crackhead - very antisocial, nervous, won't answer the door phone etc, lose track of time, and crazy OCD.  So I cut down on the coffee and that's working.  I also take ""drug holidays""  just to make sure I don't ""need it"".  When I want energy and need to focus I take it..otherwise, I leave it. I also experience mood swings and my muscles tighten up, so I get buns of steele without the exercise.  I have the best career in the world and taking adderall makes me even better at it.  Be smart, take it properly and pay attention to the side effects and you'll be alright.  I worry about children taking it because they need to be social and be accepted by their peers, and it's tough if you lack personality.  So three years for me and I'm in control of it and happy.  Oh..and when I take the drug holiday, I don't get withdrawals..just more tired than usual for the first several days.  Take Vitamin B for that."

I never had the hyper part it was more scattered, procrastination. I would start a task and start something else however nothing got done correctly. I barley made it through college due to my lack of attention and followthrough. I tried Strattera and I was a walking zombie. I hated it. Then my Dr. put me on Adderall xr and it has been fabulous. I only take 20mg a day and should talk to my Dr. about bumping up my  dose, however, I am very consiencious due to the fact that I am a recovering alcoholic for 14 years. Adderall xr has changed my life. I used to dread going to work and very busy days and now I know I can get through it. I respect Adderall and never take more than the Dr. prescribes (trust me I have been tempted to). I do have problems sleeping at times so often if I have an early morning I don't take my second dose later in the afternoon the day before. This drug has saved me so much anxiety before I was on it and how I was going to get through the day. I do get irritable and cranky at times but the payoff of focus and energy out weigh the unfocused, lethargic piece of crap I was before this. Bad News. I have not lost any weight. Good news I have not gained any either. Good luck. Stay moderate

I have to say I've had a pleasent experience with this. I am in Nursing school, so the Adderall gives me that extra push I need. I feel like I constantly need to be studying, I listen & take better notes in class, and my grades have got better. I am also able to study for longer periods of time because I have more energy & can stay up later. However, I have had some pretty drastic side effects. I occasionally have dry mouth, but my anxiety & stress seems to be 10000 times worse, I seem to make situations alot worse than they actually are. I am ALOT more irratible & don't have much patience. It has made me very blunt, so I hope noone makes me mad. & my finger has got to where it twitches but other than that.... & on the days I don't take it, i'm so tired, I can hardly keep my eyes open but i'm in a happier mood, just too tired to do anything. So for the most part, my exp. with Adderall has been good. ALOTTT better than Methyphenidate (wayyyy ti many SE!) which I was taking prior to the Adderall XR.

Another worry, my five year old (I have four kids under seven) seems to be just like his old man.  I would be devastated to have to put him on this during his physical development.

I have had every negative side effect, as well has had a lot less trouble with school. Some of the negative things the medicine cause for me are Nausea, Headaches, Dizziness, Dry Mouth, nearly Fainting when standing, General fatigue/weakness, Muscle Tension, Muscle Spasms (Sometimes EXTREMELY painful, most pain I've experienced ever), Lack of sleep, restlessness, jiteriness, Some OCD-like symptoms (Obsessing over little annoyances), and that's not all. Even though this drug has brought me so many bad things, it has also been the only thing that allowed me to be successful in school, and not be so hyper-social. I honestly wouldn't recomend this drug for some one who hasn't tried other ADHD medicines without success, as they would probably be less troublesome, but for me, this is what worked. This drug is also NOT for some one who doesn't want negative side effects, as they seem abundant. The only problem really, is the consistency of negative side effects. For some they don't appear at all. I have found that this drug makes it so that when I stay up late, I don't get tired easily, and the next day it barely feels like I stayed up late. This can be a blessing and the opposite. For instance, I stayed up late once, and forgot to take my pills the next morning, and what resulted felt like being drunk, half dead, and like I hadn't slept for at least a couple days. All I could do is sleep, and I ended up so weak that I got sick. So, the moral of the story really is, Try Adderall, and if you get negative side effects, make sure there isn't an alternative medicine for you.

I started taking this b/c i realized i had ahdh.  I was 24yrs old when i was diagnosed.  After i started Adderall, my mom saw a big difference in me.  i would actually listen when someone was speaking and not automatically thinking of a response.  my mom stated when she thought back on my childhood it made since that i had adhd.  i was never had the classic symptoms (acting out, bad in school, ...).  They never thought to test me.  i wish i would have been diagnosed as a child, i feel i was cheated out of of life.  maybe i would have completed college and not switched majors multi times.  instead, i am now working to support a child and i have 6 years or so of school i have completed but no degree.  if any parent is unsure, let their child try it.  trying it wont hurt anything, you can always take them off.  i wish i would have known or had the opportunity to decide on medicating, i may have made the wrong choice but at least i would have had a choice.  Adderall has helped me w/a lot of things.  i have better friendships b/c i am a clamer person.  at work i can actually sit still and get tasks done.  i have always got work/homework done but now i do it without thinking how much i dislike whatever i am doing, i can focus and get it done before i even think about how i feel about it.  i love adderall and never go without it!

I am 41 years old. I am currently working on my Degree in College. I had taken other ADHD medications which was like taking nothing. After speaking to my Doctor about other medications for ADHD, we decided to give this one a try. It is easy to use, It works for me, and I am completely satisfied. Some will say this is an evil drug and don't start it at all. Of those who say it is evil, I say talk to your Doctor and try something else until the right one is found for you. I no longer have a foogy brain, I can sit in class and not fidget..I understand and now retain what is said..and while yes I still get tired because I also have MS & Fibromyalgia just to name a couple of things, it works for me and I no longer need to sleep for 16 hours a day. So I say to everyone, young and old always discuss the way your ADHD, & ADD medicines are working and if you find something is not working well, then try another medication to find the one that works. Never give up. No one is alone.

Without the help of Adderall XR, it would be much more difficult for me to concentrate in school and at my full time job.
This medicine has helped me yet I can see how it can be habit forming.  For this reason I choose to only take the medication when and if I need it.
It doesn't necessarily bring about moodiness for me, though it does help me from getting distracted easily.  The way I would describe it in Layman's terms is; It gets me in the zone.
Be careful with this medication."

I'm 6'2"" tall and weigh 200lbs.  I can easily sum up Adderall xr by saying WOW!!  I used to be very very anti anything ADD/ADHD, I use to think it was a way for the pharmaceutical companies to ""push more drugs"" on us.  What changed my thinking was when my son was having a lot of trouble with school work and was diagnosed with ADHD.  I saw the exact same symptoms in him that I had when I was young.  I have always had trouble in school.  It wasn't that I wasn't interested I just couldn't stay focused long enough to get into the material.  I went and spoke with my family doctor, told him the situation, the symptoms I was having, my past school performance, current job performance, etc... and he decided to prescribe me Adderall xr 25mg.  Another thing he told me to do was to cut out ALL caffeine, which I did.  The first three days I popped Ibuprofen all the time because of caffeine withdrawal headaches but after that the transformation has been wonderful.  I have had anxiety problems with mild depression for as long as I can remember, actually anxiety runs on my side of the family.  Starting the first day with Adderall I could tell a big difference.  I had that euphoria that everyone writes about but my thinking, concentration, my ability to prioritize, and get things done has been AMAZING.  Now that I have been on the med for a little over 3 months the euphoria feeling is gone, that was gone in the first few days of use, but my ability to stay focused, concentrate, prioritize, and basically ""get er done"" has been excellent, actually after a month of being on the med it seemed like it improved somewhat again, I actually find myself speaking slower and more methodically.  I couldn't be happier.  I actually think that A LOT of my anxiety and mild depression have been related to my NOT being diagnosed with ADD sooner in my life.  Since starting this med I actually feel like a different person. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

I finally took a proactive approach to my life and decided to get tested (observed). Come to find out i have ADHD. Most of my friends said they knew i already had it but it was not that apparent to me. The diagnosing doctor told me my life would improve drastically to the medication and what it has to offer. Well, within months of starting the medication my employer created a new position for me as i was finally able to focus. My finances are getting back on track (paying stuff off instead of frivolous spending). Relationship i am working on but i am finally more focused on taking my career even further. I wish i would have taken this approach earlier in my life. I am now 33 and finally living my life the way i want. I used to sleep terrible, now i actually have no issues falling asleep (most of the time anyway). My dreams arent random and dont wake me up anymore and i dont feel that everyday should not end cause i didnt get everything done. If you feel the same and are wondering why you are like you are go to a behavioral therapist. You life WILL improve just as my therapist told me it would. Now to find Mrs. Right ;)

Let me start off by saying, yes, my grades improved dramatically--moreso than they have in years.  However, I noticed that my anxiety has gotten worse. I will get paranoid about stupid things that aren't worth getting paranoid about.  Does anyone know why this is? Plus, when I first started taking it, I could tell that my heart rate was moving much faster. That was annoying.  AND it really freaks me out that the one of the warnings on the label says, ""May cause sudden death.""  WHHAAATTT???!!!  I guess it all depends on how many mg's you're taking, right?  I don't know how some people are taking over 100 mgs of this stuff!!! Maybe they just have really bad symptoms of ADHD. I don't think I could ever let myself take more than 10-15 mgs of this stuff. The label does warn consumers of heart problems and things like that, so I'll just stay at my current dosage.  It has helped me dramatically in school, though! YAY!!!"

My ADHD diagnosis at the age of 35 was liberating. I saw the 'top' doctor in NYC who charged $750 and saw me for 15 minutes to make the diagnosis - promptly prescribing Adderall RX. Each subsequent $250 session lasted less than 5 minutes to monitor my progress on the Adderall RX. Initially things were great. I was able to focus on tasks, I did not get drowsy driving and my appetite was manageable. I actually lost 12 pounds! I saw that as a positive side-effect. At the time I started, I read that Adderall RX was the new Hollywood diet drug, so I felt tres chic! Anyway, it took me a while to realize that Adderall RX was making me less tolerant with more feelings of rage. At one point, I broke a full length mirror in my wife's office by impulsively putting my shoe through it during a heated argument. I MUST NOTE THAT I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE!!! I also felt what I could only describe as a pain in my liver after several months of taking the drug. If I stopped temporarily, the pain went away. As soon as I resumed, the pain came back. Another leading NYC expert consulted with a top expert at Mt. Sinai, who had never heard of this side effect. Whether it was recorded or not, I had it and don't since stopping the med. My course on Adderall RX lasted about 9 months. I also was in a n ADHD group therapy class. In the end, I deceided that this is who I am, that drugs are not a miracle cure and that the pain in my liver and feeling enraged was not something that was worth the extra focus and appetite suppression. I do keep a stash for long driving trips, because it absolutely keeps me alert and I don't feel like I have to pull off the road to nap. Hope this helps. WOuld love to know if others felt this pain in their right side or, as I describe, my liver."

I am now 41. I started on 20mg and noticed an immediate differance in my focus and energy. But soon the effectivness wore off and I went up to 40mg... then 60... then 80... then 100... then 120mg. I began to experience psychotic-like symptoms and my doctor pulled me back to 40mg. I dont feel like its doing anything for me anymore and I often find myself staring... just zoned out. You will always need more of this drug over time for it to actually work. It is highly addictive. I cant get out of the bed without it. It used to be my ""wonder drug"" in the beginning. I felt better and worked harder and smarter than I'd ever dreamed possible. Now I suffer with severe anxiety and cant focus on anything for very long. It causes irritability and keeps me from eating regular meals. But I am addicted to the energy it gives me and just today I told my psychiatrist not to take me off of it even though I have such bad anxiety. He isn't the same doctor that once prescribed 120mg. He really thinks I should come off of it. Deep down, I believe I should too. Sometimes, even on just 40mg I feel so wired. My eyes dilate, my hands are always cold and I shake. I have to take Lunesta 3mg to go to sleep at every night. I will say that Adderall XR was only a short-lived fix for me. I have never been hyperactive... just attention deficit. If you are taking it, maybe you will have better results than I have."

The only side affects I've noticed are it seems like it takes me longer to fall asleep at night.  I think the drug has helped me immensely, I have been taking 20mg of Lexapro for about 4 years now and it has helped with my anxiety but my head always felt clouded, I always felt like ""my get up and go got up and went"".  I was always just sluggish and wanting to nap all the time.  My attention span was always very short and I became bored with things very fast, I was constantly punishing myself for daydreaming and trying to make myself focus.  The second day of being on Adderall XR was when I noticed the biggest differance, and it has been the same since starting.  My thinking is SO MUCH clearer.  The constant ""background noise"" of continuous thoughts is gone.  I was afraid when I started the drug I would feel like I was on a caffeine overdose, but it's not like that at all.  Your thoughts just clear, I even speak slower, I'm more focused on what is going on, I don't even think about taking a nap anymore, don't have a need to.  Things that I used to constantly procrastinate on just get finished.  Not only are you doing the things you didn't do before you have an enjoyment in doing them.  I have always felt that I was an anxious child growing up and I think that A LOT of my anxiety problems as an adult were definitely related to my ADHD.  So far I can't say anything bad about Adderall XR.  I take one 25mg capsule in the morning, eat breakfast and go about my day.  The only other medications I take are a multivitamin and a fish oil supplement at lunch and Lexapro 20mg before bed.  I would highly recommend Adderall XR especially if you have anxiety and depression.  Good luck to all. "

That about sums it up. Too much of a good thing. It was typical. It made me feel great. It made me feel as though life was worth living. I wrote, I focused, I read, then before I knew it, the crash would hit. And I would pop another one. At one point, I was up for FIVE DAYS with NO FOOD. Things start to go down hill on day 2. You can't focus as well, your nerves are shot. You are weak. But man, when that exhaustion hits, it's so scary. I did this off and on for months until one day my doctor said, ""No more."" This was because I finally told him, ""Im out and I feel like I'm dying!"" I was taken off large doses 60-80mg a day for 4 months COLD TURKEY. I was out early. And this time I told him. I could not take it. I hard trouble just moving from the bed to to bathroom.I was SEVERELY depressed to the point of suicidal thoughts. I slept 23 hours a day for five days. My tolerance was though the roof. I could take 80 mg in the morning just to feel ""normal."" Finally a doctor took mercy on me and cut my dose down to 20 mg a day with the explicit understanding my mother would be doling them out to me. I weaned off them gradually. Finally down to 5 mg a day. The withdrawals from this drug when it abused is nothing short of the definition of hell. Exhaustion is complete and total. You are NON FUNCTIONAL.  It's hard to give it a rating because my addictive mind abused the hell out of it. If you have any history of substance abuse STAY CLEAR! WORST DRUG I EVER ABUSED AND I DID JUST ABOTU ALL OF THEM!"

I was off meds for quite a while, but in my senior year of college, decided to try adderall.  Heard good things, and have noticed that it wakes me up almost like drinking a cup of coffee.  Definitely pay attention better, but I may up my dosage, as I am only on 25, where I was on 40 when i took ritalin.  The biggest thing i noticed though, was my lack of appetite.  I don't even think about food until at least midnight, depending on when i take the pill.  As of now I have only been on it for a couple weeks, and have lost 6lbs.  For me, that is an added bonus, but could pose problems later on and possibly malnutrition if I keep forgetting to eat.  Overall though, very satisfied.

Adderall was a miracle pill.....at first. My mood was much better, I could think crystal clear, and energy!!!  My house stayed SPOTLESS. But, after about a year of using it, the effects began to wear off. It became a typical narcotic.  The ""high"" would not last but a couple of hours and as I could feel the effects starting, I'd begin a bad mood because I knew it wouldn't last long.  Then, when I would ""crash"" it was Katie bar the door! I dared anyone to give me a reason to go postal. I suffered thru until this past February when they came out with Vyvanse.

The worst side effect would be prolonged use and then when i would jsut stop for the weekend or summer etc. i would have terrible mood swings, and a loss of appetite all the time it seemed.

The trick is getting the dosage correct.  Too low of a dose kept me up for 24 hours, too high of a dose had me sleepy before noon.  With the correct dosage I sleep better than I have in years and can actually accomplish the things I need to get done.  As an adult I think it is great, but I can see how it could be difficult for a child to handle this medication.  I am not saying that I would not give it to a child, but I would be careful.  I am a 165lb, 38 yr old male and a 20mg xr dose is perfect for me. The medication works differently on everyone, but I could not imagine 60-90 mg daily. I am sure there are some that need it, but I would never give a child that kind of dose. Best of luck to you

I first started w/ ritilan and then to dexadrine and then to adderall and then to adderall xr when it came out. The majority of the yrs I was on adderall/adderall xr though. It helped me focus and get things done like it was supposed to but it made me not feel like myself. I was really quiet and reserved and just not myself when I would take it, so much that people would ask me if there was something wrong. I didn't realize that it made me feel that way so much until I graduated high school and stopped taking it all the time unless I needed it. I guess b/c I was constantly on it for so long that it didn't effect me as much, or it wasn;t as obvious til I stopped taking it.  I've taken it on and off when I needed it for 5yrs now until about 2 weeks ago I started on Focalin which seems to be working better.  In addition to lacking personality, adderall made me feel very depressed when I would come off of it.

Then I had to have spine surgery and everything went down hill. If there is a place called rock bottom, I can get you there without a map. I was very athletic, and an all-state goalie for our local ice hockey team and had scholarships poaring in the mail for college. I got so depressed I would not want to wish that, the way I felt, on my worst enemy. About the only good thing was I picked up the guitar a friend bought me and it pretty much saved my life. That was almost 10yrs ago. I have been on Adderall for about 6 months now. I was always energetic but when my wife and I had our daughter I noticed a big change in my sleeping habbits, emotions, and ability to stay alert. When I was given Adderall, the first day, I just couldn't believe the difference. I'm sharper probubly more so then when I wasn't on it. I'm so energetic, positive, and just all together alot better off. The only side effect I have is sometimes I wish I had been put on it a long time ago. I'm due for another spine surgery, this time will be the third. I have Scoliosis, a sever case too. I have 3 curves in my spine. So, with the help of god, this time when they go in and take the rods that were put in on the second surgery and somehow snapped in half out. On top of all of this though I can still remain positive and focussed. I have to be, for my family. But if not for Adderall I don't even want to know where I'd be. "

Any side effects i have had haven't bothered me and I never formed any habit or addictions to it. by tis I mean i very rarely take it during the summer or during weekends. I only take it when i need it. I cant recall ever feeling strande diffrent because of the medication either. Honestly i only realise how much i need it when i forget it. again i cant imagine id forget if i were addicted. I was never extremely hyper so i couldnt say how well it calms. I am also a sucsuessful artist and allways have been, i never have felt like it hinders my creativity or make me a zombie as it were. I have ADD, without the H but the squished the two together more recently i guess.  Seritonan is a chemical in your brain that is used among other things to block stimuli you don't need. this is why you don't feel your clothes after putting them on. I have a deficiency of it so it not inattention as much as, we try to pay attention to everything at once. witch is why during conversations my eyes dart around the room looking at everything, like the shiny stuff. I have been very happy with the medication, to the point where i may postpone increases in dosage in fear that they may decide i have too strong a tolerance and change it on me. I have been taking it long enough to have built confidence in the brand. I'm not sure if i will need it in college, only time will tell. the goal of course it to eventually no longer need the medication. I would recommend aderall but also have no experience with other medications.

He was started on adderall xr 5mg  for 1 mo. then increased to 10mg.  It's been a total of 3mo. I think this is a perfect dose for him. We saw a difference the first day. He no longer ""daydreams""or have trouble understanding what people say to him (we had his hearing tested, EEG's etc..).  Homework went from 3-4 hrs. to 1-2hrs. and it's done correctly! Most of the time he's done it all before he gets home. His grades went from C's and D's to A's and B's in one marking period. The side effects I've noticed are dry mouth and sometimes he's irritable with his 6 year old sister and he used to be extremely tolerant (it actually seems more normal now). He's lost 4lbs but he can afford it because he was 77lbs. I was worried about the slow growth side effect, but he grew 1 in. since he started. I'm just not sure if I want him to take it during summer months or maybe I won't give it to him on the weekends.  This is something I'll discuss with his doctor.

I am now 22 and just recently started taking the drug again. I stopped taking adderall for about 2 years,.... when I was on Adderall before, I only took it monday through friday, and on the weekends i didnt take it because i didnt need it. I had no problem with that when i was younger,... but when i recently went back on adderall i notice that i go through withdrawls and have to take it everyday. I work in a dental office and ive noticed it has helped so much! I learned that in the years i went off adderall i developed coping skills with the condition, like id write lists of what i needed to do. When your covered with blood, you cant always refer back to your lists as easily as you'd like. It has deffinalty helped my responce time, i deffinalty feel like im on top of things more and ready for anything that comes my way.

He was having problems concentrating at school.  He is in a dual language class in which half of his day is science and math in spanish.  Even though he didn't know spanish, he is doing great.  He started on 5 mg and when we moved him to 10 mg he was agitated for about 3 days.  It went away though.  I was concerned about growth, but for him he has grown 2 inches in the last 7 months.  The only down side was due to medicine and sports activities 5 days a week he hasn't gained a pound in those 7 months, but atleast he has grown taller.  I have to make him eat 3 times a day.  It's definately worth the results though as far as school goes!  I am very satisfied.

At the time he started he was looking at repeating kindergarten and this medication helped eliminate that. By second grade (a year and half later) he was increased to 15mg but it didn't work out well for him. I believe he became immune to it and I had to change medications. Overall it was a great medication, no side effects with him at all and he was able to take it easily (either taking it apart and sprinkling on applesauce or oatmeal or swallowing whole pill). The only down-side was that it wasn't long acting.

I am a pharmacy technician, so i have resources at work to take a look at, but I still browse webmd.

My mom was afraid to put me on anything. She has since passed away from cancer and I decided to take charge and go to a doctor.

My doctor has been very, very friendly with me. He is a general practitioner and he always asks me how I am doing on it. When I began going to him, the dr asked me what I would recommend for the medicine for me to be on.

The first choice was Daytrana. I noticed nothing from that medicine.

Next was Ritalin SR 20. It worked..but gave me headaches.

Next try was adderall 10mg BID (Twice daily). It seemed to work, but my schedule didn't really allow me to keep taking it. I also didn't like bringing a C-2 drug to work.

So he asked me about adderall XR. I told him that it was worth a try, and since 10mg twice daily wasn't working, let's up it even more.

What a great decision!! Adderall XR 30mg once daily is working! I am now accepted more by my peers.

The only thing I don't like is the fact that I'm not as hungry anymore."

My son was paranoid all day, aggitated, crying, hullisinating, anxiety, couldn't make decisions or stop talking.  It was the worst.  We took him to the emergency room and they couldn't do anything for him.  Just had to give him plenty of fluids.  It didn't wear off till 10:00 that night.

I went thru lots of tests and many trips to the psychiatrist. (Can be very terrifying for a 6 year old)I started taking Ritalin for about 8 years. When I entered high school I started taking Adderall XR 20 mg. I love this medication. It’s very easy to take. I feel satisfied with my work ethic and I constantly have my eye on the ball. The only thing I find hard is, I have a problem with socializing while on the medication. It’s hard for me to have conversations that aren’t related to work. Guess you can say that I'm in the ZONE. (Not trying to freak any one out but is basically legal “speed”) I don't eat much either. I only take Adderall Monday-Friday. I used to take it everyday but I felt as if I were in a ""coma"" like state. Sometimes I'll forget to take my med. before work and what a HUGE difference I'm very sensitive, and I feel like I can eat a horse. My family, friends and co-workers know about my disorder. I don't feel embarrassed about it; it’s a part of me that I can’t control."

Hearing this, my Dr. decided to begin with one 30mg dose of AdderallXR first thing in the morning and 30mg at noon.  As I attempted to perform the boring tasks of my ""new"" job--anxiety increased so high it seemed I would snap in two--thus, I resigned.  

At this, my Dr. switched me to one 30mg XR and one generic non-extended release of 10mg at noon.  The anxiety lessened and I found I could focus on things like never before (the bad side is, sometimes I focus on things I DON'T NEED to do and hours pass as I search the web as I was doing just now).  

While on the 60mg XR, even though I experienced a heightened level of anxiety, I did an experiment and for the first time in my LIFE, I was actually able to make an outline, a REAL outline for a speech!  As a public speaker, this is pretty important.  

One strange side effect--before Adderall, I had stopped biting my nails and now I can't keep from chewing and ripping at them.  I have to glue on plastic nails to stop.  Also, I can't seem to fall asleep before about 1:30 AM, even if I take it at 7AM. But OFF of this drug, I used to feel lethargic almost all day and perk up at night, and on this dose, I have no more lethargy and I never nap at all during the day--I actually feel like a normal, thinking human being.  I wonder, what could be wrong with that, even if it IS addictive?  I'm not sure.  

Honestly, It's as if it connected those pieces of my 52 year-old brain that were never connected before...Adderall is not perfect--sometimes I have menopausal episodes of angst that are exacerbated by taking this stimulant, but even my husband noticed a marked change.  I am more ""real"" on this mind-assisting additive than not. 

Angst and nail-biting aside,  it's as if it has helped me find who I really am--helped my frontal lobe behave normally.  I don't want to go backward in processing information. It's so much better now... "

Cut out coffee so as to not interact with Adderall and SEVERE caffeine withdrawals that I initially attributed to the adderall. I was getting extremely fatigued in the afternoon. Crashing completely. One cup of coffee or about 100mg of caffeine fixed the problem. If you've been self-medicating you ADD with caffeine, be careful of withdrawals if you go of it while on adderall. withdrawals symptoms may or may not be headaches, might be fatigue, fuzziheadedness, inability to concentrate, sleepiness. As little as one 8oz cup of coffee or 25mg of caffeine can alleviate withdrawals. Adderall works great and lasts about 12 hours. I've been on it for 8 days.

We started out with Concerta which worked for a month, but we never saw a great improvement with his symptoms. He has been on Adderall for over a year and fianally last month we reached peak satisfaction. This drug is great, but ADHD is a disease that you constantly have to monitor and keep in close contact with your health care provider. His dosage over a year has increased from 10-25 milligrams. So, if you are like me and expect that a miracle will occur and symtoms resolve after a short period of time, do not give up, things will gradually improve and then one day you look at your child and realize that he no longer has significant symptoms of ADHD. My son no longer gets in trouble at school and has been on the A honor roll for quite some time. Adderall has been a wonderful choice for my child.

A positive side effect: I would take it as soon as I got up in the morning and it made it easy for me to make it to early classes. I did experience dry mouth but it wasnt intolerable. Once in a while I would have trouble sleeping but some people say they sleep better on this because their thoughts dont race before bed. As for mood swings I didnt experience any. Some people might have said I wasn't as cheery but it was because I was so focused on getting something done I didnt have time to be distracted. I consider this a good thing.

The oldest takes 30mg and went from taking 3-4 hours a night to do homework in 3rd.grade undiagnosed to 1-2 hrs.a night. He has either been on Honor Roll or High Honor Roll throughout 6-8grade and doing very well in High School. He is in 10th grade and can tell me when he needs to have an increase in medication.  My other son is in 5th grade and is doing very well also.  He was also diagnosed in 3rd grade.  He takes a 15 mg dose.  I can honestly say is has been a god send to have this medication. There is no longer the hours and hours spent on homework every night.  Or the constant yelling to ""Go do your homework!"""

This drug ,though very helpful for my ADHD has caused me to have serious side effects from the past 3 years of use. I have now some little tics every now and then. There are little manic episodes associated with the drug. I even have depressive anxiety disorder because of this drug. Though this drug is great to solve a short term problem it should not be allowed to be used for longer terms. I am almost afraid to take it sometimes because I don't know what will happen. Also the mood swings because of the addictiveness of this drug are terrible. As I come off of it I become angry at almost everything. There is a reason it was banned in Canada.

In addition to ADHD-combination type, adult form, I also have depression and anxiety. I have tried numerous anti-depressants, with no lasting positive effects. Started AXR in Oct. 2006, and have since stopped all anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds. I can focus at work, and at school, and have far fewer problems with racing thoughts/random thoughts. I am able to function now. I did try Strattera, but found it only put me to sleep (up to 14 hours a day!), so I went back on the Adderall and will not switch again. It has definitely changed my life-- for the better."

507$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$9/23/2007 2:44:18 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have ADD, not ADHD.  I noticed a difference in my cognitive abilities almost immediately after using Adderall XR.  The 30 mg capsule made my heart race, so my dosage was reduced to 25 mg. The ideal dose for me would probably be somewhere in between 25 mg and 30 mg. My symptoms gradually worsened over a period of 30+ years and resulted in multiple job losses, divorces and financial difficulties.  I was not accurately diagnosed until age 45, although I had virtually all of the classic ADD symptoms dating back to childhood.  About 5 or 6 years ago I actually wondered if I had some type of learning disability because I could not process a complete thought, could not retain spoken information or instructions, was unable to concentrate on any task, etc. Although I discussed this concern with my psychiatrist at the time, there was no mention of the possibility of ADD.  I was given additional medication to treat my existing anxiety & depression, which did nothing to improve my ADD symptoms. However, on my first visit with a new psychiatrist several years later, I was given the diagnosis of ADD.  Of course, it would have been great to have been accurately diagnosed and treated years ago, but I am grateful to have found help at all.  I could have spent the rest of my life suffering if not for someone new taking a fresh look at my case.

I thought I grew out of it and wanted off the medication.  I am now in my mid 20's, just started a new job, which requires alot of concentration.  I was messing up all the time, and then decided to talk to my doctor about it.  She then prescribed me this medication, which after adjusting the dose, my boss and I have noticed a huge improvement.  The only things I don't like about it are, I love food and to eat.  I am underweight to begin with, and since being on addrell, I have lost about 10 more pounds.  I think I have gotten used to it, because I eat way better than the first few weeks of being on the meds. And the second thing is that I have had incressed mood swings in the mornings and evenings.  My husband and I fight like crazy now.  It doesn't matter how nice he is being, I take every thing the wrong way.  And since we both work the same hours, he never really sees me on them.
