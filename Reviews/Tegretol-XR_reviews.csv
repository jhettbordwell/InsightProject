1$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$9/26/2014 10:10:45 AM$Reviewer: Joan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"My Dr. ,a sleep neurologist prescribed this drug for ""Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy"". She started me on a dose of 800mg, but she forgot to titrate the dose.  I took the drug for 2 days (AM & PM). I experienced extreme dizziness,  severe nausea and a loud buzzing in my head. I ended up dehydrated and went to the ER.  I changed Dr. and switched to lamictal.  I am now much more cautious  about drugs and I use the old adage        "" trust  but verify"" for any medication prescribed by a DR. or dispensed by a pharmacist. "
2$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$3/28/2014 2:35:35 PM$Reviewer: Phyllis, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Trigeminal neuralgia since 2008. This is my 4th anticonvulsant. Had good results almost immediately. Controlled the stabbing pain in my head. Still have medium flare ups where it hurts to brush my teeth and eat and swallow but in so much better shape than I have been in last 3 yrs. Does make you tired and a little slower thinking but I will take that over awful pain that controlled my life.

4$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$9/20/2013 2:20:09 PM$Reviewer: VAgirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"Trigeminal neuralgia - first arose 2005 and took Tegretol which worked very well & win minimal side effects (except for dry mouth)but needed to gradually titrate up to 1200 mg/day to be completely pain free (taken in 4 doses of 300 mg every 8 hrs).  After 2 1/2 years developed leukopenia so had to change to other meds, but fortunately it turned out that TN was in remission.  But in spring 2013 TN flared up with a vengeance - worse pain than before, constant pain 24 hrs per day (couldn't even blink my eye).  Ended up having to take 60 mg Cymbalta 2xday, 100 mg Topamax 4xday, and 100 mg Lamictal 2xday.  Side effects extremely dry mouth, dry eyes and dry all mucous membranes; feel extremely confused with word loss, loss of short term and long term memory, loss of ability to think logically (bad for me as a business person), loss of creative ability (bad for me as an artist), in short unable to function - everything takes twice as long to do.  BUT the advice that I have for every body being treated here and that no MD ever told me before my recent desparate trip to the Mayo Clinic:  since you are being treated with meds that work by suppressing the Central Nervous System, anything you consume that stimulates the CNS works against your meds.  So quit drinking all colas (Coke, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, etc), coffee, tea, chocolate, etc. and sugar.  Also, as is noted on your meds, unless you want to go to sleep and perhaps never wake up again, don't consume alcohol.
Cutting out caffeine really DOES make a difference in the effectiveness of your meds - I discovered this the hard way."

Although, I have permanent damage and I've lived another 17 years since the doc. told me I only had 10, I work and am off disability, remarried, walk, go biking, dancing, hiking, etc. Take an active roll in your health care, ask questions and keep a journal of you new meds. and any and all symptoms.

7$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$5/17/2013 8:53:09 PM$Reviewer: jenbayly17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$4$This medicine worked for me for 14 years as long as I paired it with nuerontin. When I started to have trouble was when I had a large weight loss. I wanted to lose the weight because I had struggled with being overweight since childhood and decided that I didn't want to be left in the dust all the time because I was fat. So I lost 120 pounds and had asked my neurologist if I needed to change anything with the dose and he told me no. Well I ended up in the  hospital twice do to low sodium levels. I found a different neurologist that now is getting my dose correct for a different medicine and I have not had sodium problems since I was taken off the tegretol xr. I hope this is helpful to someone. Don't be afraid to get a second opinion.

I have been seizure free for 12 years using Tegretol (brand only).  Currently using a maintenance level of 400 mg per day.  Tegretol has left me with no side effects.

I have been on all doses & types of Tregretol. I have had a microvascular decomprssion and gamma knife and other smaller proceedures. Everything worked for awhile, but the trigeminal nerves are very nervy & keep coming back worse. Tegretol is now causing severe sodium loss and low blood pressure problems. Doc has lowered dose to 100mg 2x day, but wants me off all meds. Sure easy for him to say he has never felt like he was being electrocuted in the face.

I am now worried about the sodium & blood pressure issues (I keep fainting, last time in the hosp for 5 days because of injuries). Anyone have a miracle cure??

Regular teg before that.  Since my brain surgery for complex partial leading to grand mal seizures, I am fully under control.  A reason some, including myself, may have seizures while on it is becoming dehydrated and causing electrolytes to become unbalanced.  Just make sure you stay hydrated and drink something like gatorade to fix that and you'll be fine.

I swear by it.     In the beginning it was hard to say the least. Not going to lie....  Those side effect were AWFUL.  I had every last side effect, you name it I had it.. except it has never made me tired. The dry mouth was by FAR THE WORST.  If you can get through those side effects which don't last forever. Mine pretty much disapeared within a month or so...the worst ones disapearing first I must add.  I would highly recomend it for the treatment of someone trying to cope with bipolar at the end of a short rope.  I have tried ALL the bipolar meds out there in every combo you can dream up except lithium and depakote...so I've circled the block a few times and this is deff worth a try.

I had a break in use due to a switch in Ins. companies (I was off this drug for about 3 months) and I have been back on it for about 2.5 months now and I am having severe headaches, as well as the typical loss of interest in sex and lack of orgasm intensity.  I am not sure this med is working this time around? I often have dbl vision or blurred vision or I have to ""re-focus"" whenever I am trying to read things. I may have to switch meds?"

After taking Tegretol (general) for about 2 years, I still have blank stare sometimes, so Doc. switched me to Tegretol XR(extended release). I am taking 200mg X3 per day. It is more effective in controlling the blank starring and gradually the zombie, lost of words and out of reality feeling were all gone by now (it's been more than 2 year now on extended release). It's well tolerable without nauseous feeling or dizziness for me. Thank God for this!
62$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$2/6/2009 4:11:12 PM$Reviewer: Gwen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been on tegretol 200mg, once in the morning and later at suppertime with my other meds, since June 2007.  Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis since Nov. 2002, 30 lesions presently in my brain.  Trigeminal Neuralgia attack last June 2007, holding onto the front and back of my head and being rushed to the hospital with 200 over 156 blood pressure when I got there. There is no way to describe the pain, except to say a gun would have been the only relief.  In olden days called the suicide syndrome, I personally know why having experienced trigeminal neuralgia first hand.  Since taking tegretol no more attacks, thank you Lord.  I was taking every night copaxone shot, for multiple sclerosis then found out its the weakest of meds!!!  Now, I am on Tysabri once a month infusion, and no relapses since I have been on it for multiple sclerosis.

Never have had a problem. Needless to say, no more seizures either- knock on wood. I have went through pregnancy and birth while taking this drug and my son is perfect, no birth defects; although we planned the pregnancy, talked to all my doctors before hand, and started prenatal vitamins way before I even got pregnant. I have been very happy taking this medication, the ones I was on before hand didn't stop my seizures.

Tegretol did a great job of taking away the pain, but it made me stupid. I couldn't remember anything that I read, even if I read something seconds ago.  Within 4 months, I had to bump up my dossage from 200 mg twice a day to 600 mg twice a day.  I couldn't afford to be stupid and choose to have Microvascular Decompression surgery.  It's worked and I'm drug free.

I hate it. I was diagnosed with an abnormal EEG and Tegretol XL was prescribed to prevent seizures after a bowl dropped on my head in CA from a seagull (?) we think on the 3rd floor balcony. My EEG was abnormal so dr. put me on this drug. I cannot take it anymore. It makes me sick (vomiting) and really weird. I am done with it. I would rather wait till the brain injury has healed and take the chance of a seizure until then. Yes, I am scared of it, but it outweighs the side effects. I have to ""live"" my life. This drug definitely altered my brain; not in a positive way at all. That was more scary than a possible seizure. Just research this drug first, please! JMHO:)"

Because, I needed so much of that medicine to get my levels right, I was totally worthless.  Beyond tired - absolutely exhausted.  It was as if I were drugged.  A year ago, my Dr. switched me to this drug (700 mils a day, taken twice a day - morning and night).  At the beginning, the medicine altered my moods and I was extremly happy.  Also, no more exhaustion.  HOWEVER, the adverse affect I experienced was a sore throat.  I had an ultrasound of my throat and lymphnodes taken and all was normal.  I'm still on this med and the sore throat has calmed down to almost extinction.  I've researched other meds and find this one (w/the exception of the sore throat) to be fitting for me because it doesn't make me sleepy, confused, etc. - I do not experience any other adverse reactions as I've read in other reviews on this matter.

In the begining this drug was very effective I belive. But as time went by we have misscaried five babies. Found out that I have autoimune disorder. ANA, and Antipospholipits. My head is in a fog alot of the time now. I now have middle nerve left and right arm damage along with a second nerve in the left arm. Nero dr doesn't knw why. tingling the whole right side of my head both palms of my hands and pads of both my feet, radiating up both legs. Ended up in the ER latly and they thought It was all im head (crazy woman)I presented with forced speach and numbness and tingling on the whole right side. My Ochsner doctors now think I am a psych case because I am telling them my signs and sysmpoms. I am going to have to get a second opinion. Nobody wants to look at my meds as the poss. problem. After what I read today doing simple reseach I think the doctors have completly missed the boat.
