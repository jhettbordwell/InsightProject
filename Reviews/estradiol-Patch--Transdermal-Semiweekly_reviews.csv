It has regulated my sleep and emotions.  To easily remove the adhesive, use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol.  
1$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$3/25/2015 11:55:21 AM$Reviewer: katydid, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been using this .5 mg patch for the past 11 days- changing it every 3 days- and I feel significantly better as far as mood and I sleep very well.  That is a miracle. I did not know poor sleep was a side effect of low estrogen.  So happy I did not have to resort to sleeping pills. I am worried about developing a rash from the patch but so far so good.  
2$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$11/24/2014 1:06:59 PM$Reviewer: estrodiolneeded, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more$5$5$5$Another 70 year old on estradiol and doctors want to take away, this is the result of the doctors not understanding the difference between estrogen and estradiol.

6$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$2/2/2013 3:15:25 PM$Reviewer: Feeling&#39; Fantastic, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I began using a very low dose patch due to hot flashes, extreme perspiration, facial flushing, mood swings and difficulty concentrating. All of these irritating symptoms are either gone or so mild that I can ignore them.  Please note, I also take an antidepressant (escitalopram), which also helps prevent mood swings and difficulty concentrating, but I don't experience the foggy thinking which usually accompanies the use of antidepressants. I have no skin irritation from the patch's adhesive. It adheres well to my skin; no premature peeling. If one dose of the patch is too strong and the next lower dose is too weak, the patch with the stronger dose may be trimmed before application, which is what I do, without worry of it peeling off prematurely. I love using the patch. It has greatly improved my quality of life.

Never any problem--now Dr says I can't have it anymore--senior citizens shouldn't enjoy sex.  I will find another way.  Miserable without this med.

9$Condition: Low Estrogen After Operation to Remove Ovaries$10/18/2009 1:30:55 AM$Reviewer: Jessica, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Starting using the patch after Hysterectomy at 31, went two weeks without it and after mood swings and hot flashes starting urgently went and got it filled! Thank God, I feel good,the only real problem is the rash circles from the patch, moved it to my back-side and hoping it wont be so tender there! It itches when it doesnt get any air to that spot where it has been on my stomach even though I have moved it many times and almost every 3-4 days reapplying it to another spot on my tummy! But it is a whole lot better than how I felt before my surgery and post op without any hormones to keep me sane.....being ill all the time is awful!!  I have been having mild migraines but they usually go away after a long hot bath and some pain medication!!  I never thought I would be going through this at my age but I know I'm not the only one!  Hope this helps!  Read up on some of the drug interactions on this site...didnt know anything about those...good to know in advance what may interact, my pharmacist never said anything nor did my OBGYN!! -Good Luck- Jessica of AL
10$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$3/9/2009 1:14:28 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$This was great - it stopped the night sweats, depression/mood swings and hot flashes at a dosage of 14 mcg.  I stopped taking it after 2.5 years due to concern over long term usage and my hot flashes and night sweats are back in full force but my moods are fine.

12$Condition: Other$1/31/2009 1:16:09 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$2$Started taking this med 1 month ago after stopping premarin.  Applying the gel requires waiting until  it dries before putting on your clothes.  I am taking a low dose, may need to try higher since it has not relieved my symptoms.

Drawbacks are my skin gets irritated wherever I put it so I have to find new spots and thats the second problem. Finding unexposed skin wher it won't rub off.
14$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$7/2/2008 9:27:20 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $2$1$3$"I found the medication did help slightly with vaginal dryness , but it was not worth the little bit of benifit. I was left with discoloration on my skin for weeks on each spot that I placed the patch. I began to feel like a dalmation. I have stopped using the patch and I feel the same as prior to use. I prefer the use of vaginal cream to treat the dryness I experience rather than use the patch again for the small amunt of benifit I received. It may work well for other women with ""hot flashes"" and other symptoms, so talk to your doctor about the risks and benifits and do research. This product may work for you. Good luck!"

Not effective for these symptoms after 4 months of treatment, though seems to have greatly reduced mood swings. Unexplained rash on torso and back of neck resulted within 2 weeks of starting use.

It has helped with my sweats and my moodiness.
