0$Condition: High Blood Pressure$5/31/2016 6:01:52 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$2$Was prescribed  0.2 mg. 2x daily. Taken for over 2 yrs. I hate feeling tired, no libido, wt. gain and overall feeling of lethargy. Dr. trying to wean me off with 0.1mg am and added 2.5 mg Norvasc am. Not too bad, some withdrawal symptoms but tolerable. DCEd am catapres and added 2.5 more Novasc. Someone SHOOT ME. The withdrawal symptoms are horrific! Dizzy, headaches, pounding heart, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. My Dr. states that they will go away hopefully within a few weeks, if I stay sane through this process. Hate to think what will happen when I go off the pm catapres. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD EVEN RECOMMEND THIS HORRIBLE DRUG!
1$Condition: High Blood Pressure$2/8/2016 12:39:39 PM$Reviewer: chris, 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$Works, but side effects take getting used to. I can't take diuretics or beta-blockers, and this is the most effective at controlling blood pressure of everything I've tried. Dry mouth and eyes are the worst side effects, but these are easily mitigated. If you're not used to it, though, that first pill will hit you like three martinis.

I was on 8 other BP meds but when the Doc added this one My BP remained high but I was afraid to go down the stairs I was so unsteady.

I was always terribly tired, dizzy, nauseated, I felt like I was in a continual narcotic withdrawal.

I read for some it works but for me it was a nightmare and the first drug I have ever refused. "

4$Condition: High Blood Pressure$10/20/2014 3:52:14 PM$Reviewer: Sheryl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$2$5$I went into the Emergency Room with a BP of 170/131.  Yes, this drug dropped my BP very quickly, but I feel like a zombie.  I wish there was another drug that works as well without this side effect.  I tried to quit alcohol but found cold turkey is actually the worst thing to go through (in my opinion).  I was honest with the emergency Dr and Nurses and they were very understanding.  But they said my BP was way too high.  There are sooo many actual risks of going cold turkey that people do not realize.  Strokes, Seisures, heart attackes, so DONT try it alone.  Seek help if you want to come off any drug.  This is day 2 of me taking this drug Catapres, and it might have just saved my life.  I will put up with being drowsy.  My BP came down and has stayed down for 2 days.  I welcome the pills, the hell with the alcohol!

6$Condition: High Blood Pressure$1/27/2013 8:27:05 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$My high blood BP readings started one day just over a year ago.  After trying 9 medications with side effects to severe for me to handle, I was prescribed clonidine. I started out with one 0.1 mg per day which was then increased to 2 pills per day (0.1 mg) and am now taking 3 pills per day (0.1 mg).  This new dosage is working well but I hate to be on this medication after reading that it can cause glaucoma.  The problem for me is that I'm one of those patients who is allergic to many medications and clonidine is the only one I can handle.  My side effects are dry mouth and chest discomfort with pain down my left arm from time to time but compared to the severe migraines, diarrhea and dizziness while on 9 other BP meds, this one is fantastic.  I would just caution people to research the glaucoma side effect.  Glaucoma leads to blindness.  Is there anyone out there who has found a similar anti-hypertensive high BP medicine with fewer side effects?  Most high BP meds have terrible side effects including eventual kidney damage and diabetes.  Surely there must be something safer out there for us to use!!

8$Condition: High Blood Pressure$6/4/2011 8:48:25 AM$Reviewer: Sterling, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$5$"I was prescribed to supplement other med for high blood pressure. I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I was put on oral Meds and began using meter to check my levels. Was already restricting carbs and exercising. Discovered my levels were consistently normal 2 hrs after lunch, dinner and at bedtime, but upon rising and 2 hours after breakfast were extremely high. I only took Clonidine at bed time. Googled and found several articles suggesting this adverse result. Did not find it in most posts. Eliminated dose one night and following morning blood sugar normal. As Clonidine was not controlling bp well I will seek other solutions. I'll continue testing blood sugar for a while but looks like I wasted $$$ on dietitians, Meds and testing supplies. "
9$Condition: High Blood Pressure$5/21/2011 8:08:13 PM$Reviewer: bbgirl, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$2$5$"Have been on the drug for several yrs,  ( .1  at 2 times a day).   Within an hr. after taking I am either asleep or fighting to stay awake!  Voice hoarse, constantly clearing throat, dry mouth, weakness, lethargic, nightmares.  BP sometimes drops too low.  Was in hospital for arrythmia, DR. stopped my Catapres suddenly and after two days my BP spiked dangerously high...had to go back on it immediately.   Am sensitive to meds & this does control my BP but side affects are troublesome.   Effectiveness appears to be wearing off the last few months for BP control. Muscle cramps and nightmares are increasing. I also take Norvasc and took Cordorone for about 6 years (have been taken off this one for arrythmia but is taking months to get it out of my system....been off 8 months).  Cordorone affected my thyroid, teeth & gums, hair, muscle tone, stomach, reflux..... bad drug over time..wish I had known. I ask more questions now and am more persistent with DR. concerning my own observations concerning meds and side effects.  I keep a brief diary and it has been SO helpful to recognize  a pattern developing while taking meds and/or symptoms.

10$Condition: High Blood Pressure$5/11/2011 9:01:34 PM$Reviewer: diamondgirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$4$started conidine for emergency HBP after reaction to steriod and discovered that a very low dose 1/2 of.1 mg. pill twice a day controlled my fluctuating BP (from underlying anxiety)and rapid pulse. after 5 mo. I am very tired of putting up with side effects, mainly tiredness and drowsiness(I take other meds that cause sleepiness). Being menopausal, I actually get MORE hot flashes and a stinging feeling around my head. I also think it makes my fibromyalgia worse or at least adds joint pain to it. and then there is the itching (which is a transient symptom of FMS but seems more often especially if I throw a new or different drug in the equation.) It just has many side effects. I intend to try to ween off it but all antihypertensives have their side effects and often don't work. just bang my head against a wall! I am hypersensitive to drugs and very discouraged as I sit here itching!   
11$Condition: High Blood Pressure$1/10/2011 3:07:31 PM$Reviewer: zemia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was diagnosed with high blood pressure some 20 yrd ago and started on Catapres. Since then I've changed PCP's and they have tried to change me from Catapres to the ""new"" drugs only to have my BP get out of control. The generic seems to work, though not as well as the original name brand. If anyone is having with feeling tired, I suggest talking with your dr about adjusting your dosage to maybe twice a day instead of once as Catapres lowers your BP quickly. Since I've taken it for such a long time, I monitor my BP and adjust the dosage when necessary."

I take 40 mg.  Lisinopril and a diuretic daily. I am tired of having emergencies and was finally given the patch. I thought this would be the end of these daily episodes but my blood pressure is as high as ever. I have the patch 0.2 mg., I had to take two more 0.2 tablets throughout the day, plus a Lisinopril and a diuretic and my BP is now 240/110. I am at the end of my rope.
19$Condition: High Blood Pressure$9/3/2009 12:20:37 PM$Reviewer: efittery, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$4$"On and off over the years I have taken this drug.  I have taken it in its patch form and as a pill.

My results were:

When I first use the patch or take the pill it effectively drops my blood pressure.  The side effects are so bad that I can't do my work.  Falling asleep while trying to write computer code doesn't exactly make my boss happy.

After I have been taking the medication a few weeks, it has less of an effect on my blood pressure.  I remember one instance when at the doctors they took my blood pressure.  They said 175/110 was too high, put me in a dark room and started feeding me 0.1 mg clonadine tablets.  They did this on the hour for 4 hours.  At the end of that time, they let me go and my BP was 165/115.  I guess I just built up a resistance to it.

By the way, there is a machine by the name of BioZ that can and is used to diagnose WHY you have high blood pressure.  Just do a internet search for ""BioZ hypertension"" and you will find it.  I like wikipedia myself."
