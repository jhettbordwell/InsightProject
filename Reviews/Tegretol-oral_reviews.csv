1$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$8/31/2014 5:37:10 AM$Reviewer: Olivia , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I was given Tegretol after having several mild seizures and after just one week of taking the drug I had my first grand mal seizure. In the space of the 2 months I was on the drug I had 4 grand mal seizures, 15 fitting seizures, 8 stiffness seizures and my absences increased to multiple times an hour. After this my neurologist changed my prescription to Keppra and after some experimenting with dosage, in the space of two years my seizures have become almost completely controlled by my medication. Tegretol was the worst drug I have ever had the misfortune of being prescribed, my experience has been nothing but distress and increased seizures. 
2$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$6/23/2014 5:27:31 PM$Reviewer: akaReba, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on this drug since I was 7 or 8, about 24 years. I've never had any side effects (that I know of). I take 600mg XR in the morning and in the evening. I can go a few extra hours without it being a problem, but after about 3-4 hours I'll start having seizures. Can't say anything bad about it.

When I take my Tegretol consistently on the same daily schedule I can never worry about a seizure.  If I mix up my my set time I will have a problem with having a seizure occasionally.  I have my iphone alarm set to remind me daily.

5$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$9/21/2013 12:26:21 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$This was the first drug I was given after being diagnosed epileptic. Right away, I suffered a lot of side effects. Felt sick to my stomach, twitchy eyes, shaky, unstable. About 3 weeks in to the treatment, I had an allergic reaction. My body broke out in an aweful rash, head to toe. I suffered extreme burning and itching, redness, swelling, and some of my skin was covered in blisters. After a week of being treated for said reaction, I am still not completely better.

Have to use them along with the 200 mg (they are still making 200 mg, so far) to get my dose of 300,350,300,350. I don't know what I'm going to do. Taking too little is dangerous, taking too much makes me so dizzy I can't walk. I know 100 mg was not a money maker for them. My pharmacy said I was their only customer. I called Novartis today and confirmed what Walgreens told me. I have family all over the country who can get it for me, out of pocket. But that will only last so long. I'm young and have alot of years left. Means I will have to find another drug---AGAIN! This happened to me when I was 18 and on a different drug that was removed. I take it to controlseizures--Im so scared. The life I have been leading since 1968 at age 11.

At first i was taking 23 pills a day to find out what works best. Finally i am taking 1600mg of  tegretol daily. I only suffered one grand mal seizure in 1981 but continue to have a handful of petit mals daily,which last seconds.Having an understanding Dr. and family also helps.Only bad side effect at first was double vision. Everyone reacts differently to each medicine,good or bad. Stay active in your life, find something interesting to make you look forward to getting up each morning. Stop sitting in front of the tv all day long and feeling sorry for yourself.Go volunteer at your local cancer clinic (childrens)if you feel depressed.Also  i have put on weight over the years but mostly due to natural body changes and bad eating habbits.Am just happy to get up every morning with no noticable seizure disorder.Keep your mind and schedule full at all times. Exercise if your schedule is light,build your body""s endurance up slowly. Good luck to all"

40$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$7/9/2009 9:32:21 AM$Reviewer: Joe, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$4$I have been on tegretol for about 15 years. It has worked great for controlling my seizures (I have had no seizures while on it in 15 years). However, I am not a fan of taking any medications on a daily basis. Recently I had a dr. appointment and had to get a bone density scan because tegretol is now linked to osteoporosis (have not received my results yet). I haven't noticed any major side effects but I have seen a slight decrease in my passion/excitement/energy for things in everyday life. It also seems to have slowed my metabolism. I work out vigorously 6 days a week and eat pretty healthy as I am trying to lose about 10-15 pounds but am only losing about 1 pound per week (I am sure there are other factors that play into this but feel the tegretol plays a role as well). My personal thoughts, if you have a serious seizure disorder; take the medication it has worked great for me. If it is a mild disorder; try to find some other non-medicated remedy (this is my situation and I wish I would have found an alternative remedy to medication but I was 15 when I started and didn't know any better). I fear it is too late for me to stop now. Good luck to whomever reads this and I hope it helps!

They diagnosed me with a seizure disorder and prescribed this medication to me.  As of this point, I haven't been able to go back to work and I'm terrified to drive!  Next week my dosage will go up 100 milligrams, so I know it will be a few weeks before I'm used to it.  I just don't feel like myself right now, and I got my period in the middle of a pack of birth control pills!  It's a weird feeling to describe though...now I have cramps on top of it, but I'm lethargic yet silly at the same time.  Sometimes I feel like if I turn around too fast I'm gonna fall over or drop something.  I was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 26 (had my first seizure when I was 23) so I know things take time..I'm gonna give it a few weeks before I go back to my neurologist to try something else.

All of these drugs can't be good for you.

before the drug i would get the partial-seizures (can't talk right or move to well or think straight) about once every 3-4 months.  I'm still having them.  Havent' had any gran-mal's though, so not sure if it's truly helping or not."

64$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$2/17/2008 3:07:23 PM$Reviewer: PAUL BURKE, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$3$I have been prescribed Tegretol as in Retard since a child for Epilpsy, Teenage yrs depression mental disorder etc..  It has long controlled my condition of vits vomit when child, but Psy DR now keeps increaing the doses to over 400 mg 200 each used to be 100, I always believe it caused Tiredness Fatigue in my late teens still in adult yrs now I'm 30 addicted to it or would collopes not taking it.  I reduce the dose to 100 taken only at night to sleep can't sleep without it taken with Kalms herbs.  For those of you suffering Fatigue hard to wake up I could not survive if I never found Supplement in big red writting FRelieves Tiredness Naturally called YARIBA Red Box 50 tabs wakens me up right away fully I recommend it to anyone who's drugs causes sleepyiness.  1st came ot in 1990 when I was 17 to Superdrug no longer sell it nor Boots, only least Holland & Barretts & other main town Health food shops stock it.  Diomed hebal contains Kola Nut relieves fatigue works well with all medicines.  Yet I have weak bones, Bowel trouble, feet sometimes other users of Tegretol mentioned but easy controlled by Natural Medicines to relieve pains, like Calcuim, vit D, Chamomile for stress etc..

To the person who posted ""I actually passed the pill in my stool after 12 hours for a 24 hr extended release"": What you passed in your stool after 12 hours was the shell/casing, not the pill itself. And each pill lasts 12 hours, not 24. That is why you take it twice a day instead of once. Hope this helps someone with the same concerns. :-)"

The past few years things have been getting worse for me. I'm required to have a bone density test done every year due to me getting close to Osteoporsis. It eats Calicum which causes a big effect on my bones. I'm in my late twenties and my doctor says I have bones of a much older person. My doctors were stunned when they saw this. I went to two doctors to review it and get a second opinion.

I was on a sweltering holiday in Tenerife and bloated up-like a blow fish all over my body in 24 hrs with a terrible thirst. After only one anti-histamine I made a full recovery in 12 hrs. Tenerife was very hot that holiday and the average British summer has never caused me any trouble. Now I just take a precautionary anti-histamine should the temp on holiday rise above 85. My GP told me this is a reaction to taking Tegretol. Overall, my Epilepsy is well controlled and I lead a wonderful and full life!
