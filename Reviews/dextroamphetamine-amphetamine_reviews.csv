I promise..I DO MY RESEARCH
Allow me to retort
Most africans arent running from lions...you backwards jackass. Not that it doesnt seem close to hell... gang rape is a sport, female circumcision is the standard and aids is rampant( fyi .. check out the testing for the polio vaccine.... )
And i dont disagree with your ....um...spirit. 
But you make actual research and actual ,factual info look as ridiculous as you. 
2nd Hitler did not put amphetamines in public water...he put FLUORIDE.. u might look that one up yourself. Fluoride is an accumulative toxin. Makes for a more docile and somewhat less fertile public. 
Next..
 I have the great displeasure of living in middle america where meth has destroyed so many people. Its the most disgusting drug i e ever seen and its not even fun. 
Notice the teeth... what do they think is happening to that soft gray matter in their heads. Its made with lye ... and many other household poisons.
Look above u... at your plate ...water 
.
Its everywhere. Geoengineering is happening .billions of pounds of aluminium on our heads and they admit this ... if you actually look for yourself...while telling yhe masses its con trails.... like breath on a cold day. Well how do they start and stop at different times .... why does our breath not turn to haze and linger all day when its  cold?
Wake the hell up. Government:from the latin 
Gubenara.... control and mente..... mind
Look that one up ... the etymology of the word government... is mind control. 
Good luck and thank u for making us all a little happier we are being medicated.
You let me know if you need me to iron out those twisted ..yet VERY IMPORTANT FACTS ..for u again. 
Pls keep your trap shut if your not 100% sure with the facts... 
Cognitive dissonance is something we all deal with in the average person. And u are not helping our cause. Almost like a misinformation agent would...

I was put on this medication and the difference in my quality of life is like night and day. Mt bills have been paid ON TIME for 4 years now, I've stayed in the same home, I am organized. If I do not take this medication for a number of days then my house starts to look like the drawers and closets exploded. I have no ability to focus on taking care of individual tasks. It's just a difference of night and day.

I have more energy and focus that is the plus side. The negatives are stomach cramping but it is tolerable. The positive out weights the negatives.

6$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/6/2016 11:55:52 AM$Reviewer: MuskieUguy, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"This generic, in my opinion works the best for me. However it has a ""all or none"" effect, meaning one minute it could be in full force, the next, it's not. 
It is however extremely effective and puts all the other generics to shame. I would compare this generic and its effects to that of Shires Adderall XR (name brand), really I would. 

The ""crash"" from this is no tap on the shoulder, but rather a punch to the face. Lasting anywhere between 1-4 hours. (The crash seems to lessen if a blueberries are consumed at the first signs. Be sure they're USDA organic blueberries, I've noticed conventional blueberries will only make it worse! But that's all just my opinion)

The mood swings and irritability come randomly but not as bad with this drug.

Over all, top notch!"
7$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/2/2015 3:24:17 PM$Reviewer: phill, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $2$2$3$I have taken adderall xr 20 for 10 years and it has always worked well for me. My prescription coverage through blue cross blue shield recently changed and they will not cover name brand anymore. The pharmacy will tell you dextroamphetimine is the same but if you compare the two on this website you will see they are not. So I will have to find another alternative because this med makes me loose focus and concentration
8$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/4/2014 3:47:39 PM$Reviewer: Tifs Mommy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$Been taking 10+ YEARS and it has worked very well for me. I use the ER Spansule Caps (time release) for Adult Onset ADD due to other medical problems. When I worked I also used the 5mg tabs in the afternoons if I needed the extra boost, but only if I had a meeting or something that required my full attention. Now that I am retired I only use the extended release spansule/capsule. I've not experienced any problems but WATCH THE GENERICS, some release quicker than the brand, while others release slower than the brand. For me I found a specific generic manufacturer and my doctor specifies that manufacturer ONLY on the scripts. Overall, I've been very satisfied.

I feel it has helped me focus on tasks and I have more patients. I can have a conversation with someone without my mind wondering off. I actually wait for the person to finish what they are telling then respond. I do find that I am not hungry and have had a little bit of a hard time sleeping but I have to say that the good out weights the bad. SO  far, so good.

It is wonderful.  I wake up worried, scattered, no ambition to start the day, negative thoughts, etc.  I/2 hour after taking the tablets, I feel great and start my day an get things done.  My thoughts are positive, creative, enthusiastic and focused.  I love what it does to me.  I have ADD.  It gets me active and positive.  I take the 5 mg tablets because they are the cheapest, and I can take 15mg or 25 mg depending on how I feel usually 20mg.  If I have a big day I take 25 or 30 mg if it is early, like before 10am.  (I'm a night owl sometimes).  If I wake late in the day like 2pm, I take 10 or 15 mg. so I will sleep.  I have a problem with my appetite and lost weight and muscle and I think was anorexic.  I lost 25% of my body weight and was thin to begin with.  It was scary.  I started eating 2 slices of Oregon trail cinnamon raisin with vanilla toast and peanut  butter butter sandwiches. 175 Cal. per slice and alltogether about 600 cal per sandwich.  I had cold potatoes to dip in sour cream, and tried to force myself to eat throughout the day.  That is my main complaint.  I have to stop taking it because the price just went up from $25 co-pay per month to $125 copay per month.  I'm retired on medicare with a RX plan with Humana.  Right RX used to give me three months supply for $50.  Now it's $350!  I can't afford it.  I am thinking of switching to focalun, my nephew used it and the generic is cheap as dirt. "

I have 20mg 1 tablet Lexapro a day with food, and 2 5mg of dexys 4 times a day daily so 40mg total... I hate taking them every day and frequently, Overall it's stopped me from wanting to kill myself, but it can cause sleep problems when I take the last lot by evening so I have run down a bit and felt grumpy but lexapro balances my lows and I haven't laughed and enjoyed myself socially like I have of recent for a long time. I am going to cut out the evening for I already was a night out LOL. I have a sore arm like in side muscle pain i feel and sensitive even when stretching out arm, loss of appetite but trained myself to eat. I'm alot better, but need to check why my arms sore :(  it has helped me career wise and set goals, with drive, I am looking into more natural options down track.

Hardly any side effects other than decreased appetite but instead of not eating, it seemed to help me make better food choices, so I've lost weight (and needed to) but it was healthy. In the last couple months I seem to be getting a bit more aggitated. Not sure if it's the meds or just the issues going on in my life. The being aggitated isn't new for me anyway, so I can't say it's this medication that is the cause. I will speak with my dr about it, however. It seems to be not working as well as it used to. Something else I'll be speaking to the dr about. I like this medication, but am starting to get scared of it since reading the bad things about it. I use this for adult ADD.

I have had to increase 2x.  I take 20mg in the am and 10mg in the evening.  I have a lot of trouble sleeping but that works to my advantage since I am back in school full time.  I have almost no appetite but I do not let it bother me.  I notice when I don't take it (like on the weekends) I seem to be a bit more anxious and paranoid.  I also feel depressed as it is wearing of.  This is the 4th medication I have tried to combat the problems I have with ADHD.  I have only been diagnosed for a little over 3 years.  Does anyone have any advice on behavior modification to wean myself off the meds once and for all?  I don't want to have to be on these meds for the rest of my life.

I was in college at the time and it helped me tremendously stay focused on my academics.  I also discovered I had hep c and the use of drug helped combat the side affects of fatigue.  I have to admit though be wary of how much you are taking or you will find yourself not eating and no sleeping very often and the regular use of this drug can make the side affects of these symptoms oblivious.
