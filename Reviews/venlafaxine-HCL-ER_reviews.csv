At the age of 20 i went to seek help for my condition. Been taking diffrent types of SSRI for one yearand Due to many side effects i was put on venlafaxine 150 mg.
After a while my life became wonderful. 
I was flourishing and most of my bad feelings just went away. My self esteem went up. I felt normal, woke up every morning with good energies. First time for years i was happy.actually happy. Thats been the best days at my life. 
And then everything deteriorated as i decided to stop. First i was put on 75 mg, after that 37.5 mg. It was very hard quitting this drug. My dysthymia came back.
Been feeling bad for 1 year after i quit, so i decided to take this drug, that changed my life, again. 
But it didn't work. I guess im thankful for this drug for breaking my illness. This drug actually stopped my dysthymia for a while. After seeing it didnt work,Been trying diffrent types of snri,ssri, vitamins, b12 supplys but none of them worked. Im desperate.

3$Condition: Depression$11/14/2018 6:08:56 PM$Reviewer: me again, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more$5$5$5$"Life-changing, life-saving. I was prescribed 150 mg a day of the regular (not XR) form 18 years ago. I started feeling much better right away -- far less anxious and sad. The only downside is I can space out just enjoying my random happy thoughts so I need to remind myself to get back to getting things done -- but that's not too hard and way better than being sad and scared all the time. Once when I was sick (for other reasons) I couldn't keep the venlafaxine pills down which made me unintentionally go off it cold turkey, which gave me nightmares until I could get it to stay down again. That scared me so I weaned myself -- VERY SLOWLY! IMPORTANT! -- down to 75 mg a day, so now if I forget to take them I only get really sad and anxious ( no nightmares) until I get back on it. I also went off it on purpose -- VERY SLOWLY -- and stayed off for a year to see if maybe I didn't need it anymore. It was a horribly anxious year. I felt a million percent better when I went back on it. Because I take the regular form, I have never had the ""brain zaps"" or other weirdness associated with the XR form. A relative takes venlafaxine with results like mine; I think we have a genetic brain wiring issue that it mends. I am infinitely grateful this medicine exists and sad for all the people with this condition who were sad and scared every day before this was invented -- or who still are because they can't afford it. It is not for every depressed or anxious person -- I read that each medication only helps a small percent (but a different group usually) of all patients, but at least this helps some of us."
4$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$11/13/2018 9:35:19 AM$Reviewer: Raven88, 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$3$3$I started out with a dose of 37.5 mg for my severe peripheral neuropathy in my toes and upper feet. When that didn't make much of a difference - my Gabapentin/Neurontin had basically become ineffective - they raised my dose to 75 mg. I couldn't tolerate it, and both the higher and lower doses gave me chronic constipation and nausea, along with undesired weight loss. So every couple of days I take 37.5 mg, along with 600 mg of Gabapentin in the morning and 6-900 mg at night. I am about to try a formula made up of several ingredients, including Gabapentin, that I have to have made at a compounding pharmacy that will be topical. Hopefully that gives more relief, because currently I can hardly drive a car due to the extreme pain.

I do experience sweating more than I would like but I can live with it.  Overall it has helped stabilize my mood.  What I am experiencing more recently which is concerning and I'm trying to figure out if it's related to this RX is complete loss of bladder control.  I'm 38 and literally cannot hold my urge to urinate longer than a minute or two.  Has anyone had this same experience?  Over the last 6 months it went from moderate to severe.  I have a follow up to discuss but curious what others know.     
7$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$8/1/2018 5:25:55 PM$Reviewer: EmmyJay8, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$4$I was on this drug for almost 5 years and over the last 6 months or so I decided to switch. I realized I was extremely fatigued, would get random dizzy spells, more frequent anxiety (crazy right), and just didn't feel like myself. Maybe the drug just stopped working, who knows. I was on only 75 mg but not willing to increase my dose!!! Also transitioning off the drug was NOT fun... pretty much two weeks of hell. However I am off the drug now and would not recommend it to anyone else. Also if you miss a dose - brain zaps!!!! Gross.
8$Condition: Depression$7/7/2018 2:17:39 PM$Reviewer: Texas girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$3$Venlafaxine helped my depression at first. But when I lost my job, it actually made my depression worse. I couldnâ??t do anything but sleep all day. I had brain fog and increased negative self-talk. I became suicidal a couple of times. Thankfully I reported this to my doctor and she is now in the process of weaning me off. OMG itâ??s like night and day. The fog has lifted, I can think clearly, I have a much more positive outlook, I have way more energy. My recommendation is that if this drug works for you, great. But the minute it stops working, tell your doctor immediately because it could make it worse to the point of suicide. 
9$Condition: Depression$7/1/2018 12:36:41 AM$Reviewer: Erin, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"Horrible experience for me. I took ONE PILL, the 37.5 mg dose as prescribed, for depression. Through the day I felt ok, maybe a little loopy, with some tension in the neck, slight headache, grinding of teeth. Went to sleep, then woke up in the middle of the night sweating profusely, extremely nauseas and hallucinating!! I had horrible, vivid thoughts, felt completely out of body and ""compelled"" to kill myself. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced. I was not suicidal before taking this drug. The little sane part left in me stashed all sharp objects into a drawer and flushed the meds. I crawled into bed, shaking all over, sweating buckets and terrified. I won't even speak to my doctor again after this experience. Lifestyle changes and eastern herbal supplements have been far more effective. It was my first experience with antidepressants and hopefully my last."

11$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/5/2018 8:31:06 PM$Reviewer: Cici, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been depressed for about 10 years trying several different types of antidepressants. One night I got so low I tried to commit suicide and was then placed in a mental health facility for about 2 weeks. They took me off my Zoloft and put me on this. After everything I just have to say you can't wait expecting it to not work. I looked forward to it and I finally feel happy!
12$Condition: Depression$3/29/2018 10:44:17 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$I asked my doctor to prescribe me antidepressants and he prescribed me venlafaxine. I did experience insomnia, headaches, and small appetite in the beginning when taking this medicine. I started off with the minimum 37.5mg dose and increased it to 75mg after a month. The sudden increase led to suicidal thoughts and intense physical side effects. Though my doctor insisted that I take the drug for longer, I decided to get off the drug after 2 months after reading some reviews online. I just felt so tired and washed out all the time. The withdrawal was terrible. I couldn't go to school for a week. Constant migraines, nausea, dizziness, and no willpower. I was fortunate enough to only be taking the medicine for 2 months before I got off. I don't know how the withdrawals are for those who have been taking the drug for over a year. Now that I'm off, I feel like my mood has soared in the opposite direction and I'm a lot more awake/aware of my surroundings. REALLY don't recommend taking venlafaxine. It is not worth the side effects.
13$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/21/2018 1:59:48 PM$Reviewer: bw499, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$"I have been taking this for 4 months.  My issues were constant anxiety that resulted in insomnia, anger and frustration, and often confusion and disorientation.  It has helped the most with anxiety stemming from social situations, and calming the constant anxious thoughts that were causing a lot of my confusion and stress.  It has not helped as much as I had hoped with anger and frustration during stressful situations.  The first 2 weeks were awful, I was exhausted all day but had brain ""zaps"" and restless legs at night that kept me awake.  Thankfully that went away.  "
14$Condition: Other$3/1/2018 11:16:44 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"I can stress enough that this drug should be a LAST RESORT. The withdrawals are horrible, and the multitude of people stating such are not lying. I was warned about the withdrawals by my psychologist, so I asked my Dr that was prescribing this med. She said the withdrawal horror stories were not true - WRONG. She has never taken this drug - the stories are true. I was only on it for 2 months (it made me much much worse, not better) and am currently going through the withdrawal (day 4). It's absolutely awful, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, wanting to cry for no reason out of nowhere (I'm a 6'1"" 215lb man!). Some people may have no other choice but I would exhaust ALL OTHER OPTIONS before allowing yourself to be put on this stuff. Eventually you will need to get off, and the longer your on it the harder that gets. I am only posting this to hopefully save a few other people from what I am going through. Everyone is different, but scour the internet, you pretty much can't find ANYONE that stopped this stuff and didn't have issues. And you can always find someone that says they didn't have a problem coming off a med, I have yet to find one with Venlafaxine (Effexor)."

The Psychiatrist switched my depression drug I had been taking from a Prozac derivative to Venlafaxine (Efexor} because she had had such positive results in patients than any other depression medication. Within a week I could tell a huge difference in relief from depression and anxiety. I truly feel great now and highly recommend this drug. It has renewed my joy in life!!!

I was on sertraline before and was having trouble getting out of bed, and the venlafaxine gives me more energy and motivation to do things and live life. 
Easy to take, I take a 150mg extended release capsule, so I only have to take it once a day. It has worked for me! I had some unusual sweating at night and teeth clenching for the first several weeks to a month, but those have mostly gone away now. "
19$Condition: Panic Disorder$12/1/2017 1:07:29 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"I began this med because my panic attacks/panic disorder was getting worse, and I needed a change.  I certainly got that.  Within the first week, I basically lost my appetite.  By the fourth week, I was constantly nauseated, had started hearing/seeing things that weren't there, talking full volume in my sleep all night long, kicking and twitching legs in my sleep, and was in a foul mood pretty much all the time.  By the fifth week I decided to stop taking this after a two-day marathon of vomiting every hour.  Legs jumping/shaking uncontrollably.  I went two days without being able to keep food or liquids down at all.  Which meant I couldn't keep any pills down...which lead to starting withdrawal.

With panic attacks I'm pretty used to feeling crummy, but this drug...felt like poison.  I'm thrilled for people that it worked for but that wasn't me, not by a long shot.  I know I'm probably an outlier but wow.  Never been that sick in my life.

If you DO decide to take this medication, make sure if you're feeling lousy you're keeping in touch with your doctor.  I probably should have gone to the ER, in retrospect.

Make sure you start this drug sloooowly and if you come off it, come off it the same way.  Be careful out there, kids.  Good luck to you all and God Bless."
20$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$11/5/2017 12:24:53 PM$Reviewer: Kathleen M., 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$This is one of the few anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medications I have been able to tolerate after 30 years of feeling like a guinea pig and mostly not taking medications due to side effects.  A genetic test revealed I should not be taking SSRIs or many other medications.  Everybody is different, but this has been the most effective I have ever tried, with no obvious side effects.
21$Condition: Depression$10/6/2017 9:33:38 PM$Reviewer: Mytiggertiger, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$"Four years ago I injured my hamstring and pretty much every near-by body part on my left middle quadrant (hip, ALL my glute muscles, IT band, hamstring, etc) and fell into what my Doctor referred to as ""pain induced depression"".  He explained that if I were not in pain, I would not be depressed.

My injury caused permanent nerve and muscle damage, so I had to make drastic life-style changes that I was not use to.  (I went from overly active, to just getting by.)

I tried Cymbalta and after just one pill, it was a no-go for me (bad reactions.)  I was hesitant to try another brand, but thought I had nothing to loose.

My Doc put me on the lowest possible does of Venlafaxine (25mg 3xday) and after just 1 week, I started to notice a difference.  He wanted to increase me after 3 months, but I have never asked for it, as the minimal dose is just enough to get me wanting to live life again.  It also helped reduce my pain just enough that I have not had to go from my regular Tramadol to the dreaded Percocet.

I know this is not for everyone, but if you have nerve pain AND are depressed, this just may work for you.

NEVER GIVE UP, sometimes you have to be your own advocate.  (I saw 15 docs, had 9 MRIs, 7 various injections, 2CTs, 2 surgeries, 1 ultra sound, 1 PRP injection all in 4 years before I found something that works for me."

I no longer fly off the handle.  I have energy and have even lost 5 lbs. Can't beat that. I take it in the morning, tried the afternoon but had problems getting to sleep come night time.
24$Condition: Depression$6/6/2017 6:58:17 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$"After getting this prescribed and not noticing any positive effects on my mood or energy levels, the psychiatrist suggested taking a higher dose and I have done so over the months up to 225mg. Even at that dosage I did not notice anything positive. 
The negative effects were less energy and a slight reduction in getting stuff done (which was already at a low level). Also lost my sex drive completely and I started eating a lot less and lost 10kg quite quickly. These were things that were all managable. 

The real problem started when I wanted to stop taking this, the withdrawal effects are horrible and make me feel physically sick. The brainzaps I am familiar with from withdrawing from citalopram and escitalopram and I can deal with fine. Bad nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, total exhaustion and flue like symptoms I am not familiar with and wish I knew about before even considering this drug. I have hot and cold flashes, I can't sleep for more than 2 hours at a time and wake up sweating, I am extremely irritated and restless. Taking the medication again gets rids of these symptoms quite quickly. Building down by halving the dosage all the way down to 37.5mg was not hard for me personally, but going down from that will require other drugs or me cutting open the pills and managing a lower dose through that. 

All in all this is not a drug that I could recommend without people being made aware very clearly that it has severe withdrawal effects. "

I have also been on vyvanse for 4 years, so maybe there is an interaction there. I tried this after 3 different SSRIs didn't work. I woke up incredibly anxious, sweating, had chills and then hot flashes, and then threw up and couldn't eat or drink for hours. I got so dehydrated I had 2 IVs of saline put it me. So yeah, it is possible to get serotonin syndrome after taking one pill. I stopped throwing up after the effexor wore off and I got some zofran at the hospital.

DO NOT TAKE THE 225mg SINGLE-PILL GENERIC. IT SUCKS. The time-release mechanism is wonky. Take 150mg+75mg generics, THE CAPSULES!!! I can't stress this enough!

Anyway,

Used to take 150mg, it worked, but not well enough. After a psychiatric hospital visit I upped my dose to 225mg and it's working wonders. I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (w/ mild OCD), and ADHD. It has done wonders for the first two, I can actually go out and be a normal human without anxiety attacks. I no longer fear being in public places or doing things that were hellish for my anxiety before like the simple act of making phone calls. I'm no longer actively suicidal and I can't be grateful enough. I do experience the side effects mentioned of excessive/weird sweating but I'm used to it because when I took Wellbutrin it was the same if not worse and I'm a little chubby anyway. The yawning is a little weird but nothing too major. I do have unusually high earwax build-up but I think it's more blood pressure related. Sex drive is fine though, it didn't obliterate it like Zoloft did, which didn't work for me anyway. I can't comment on the supposedly hellish withdrawal symptoms since I'm not withdrawing from it anytime soon but do always refill your prescription before you run out and don't skip doses!! No bueno when you skip a dose!

Good luck to everyone!"

I rarely had hot flashes when on Estradiol and my mood swings were pretty much under control. Since I couldnt take my Estradiol anymore, my PCP prescribed venlafaxine because other patients had success with it. After about 2.5 months, I started to have bad hot flashes, but the worst was the mood swings and depression. I thought maybe the lowest dose should be increased, so PCP told me to double. Awful decision. I had to stop after about 5 days. I was extremely anxious, very depressed, crying, mood swings all over the place (not a nice a person to be around). I was annoyed with EVERYONE, I couldn't fall asleep at night, and was tired all the time and had to takes naps in the daytime. Just a really bad experience for me; not a good choice of medications. I can't even stand myself. Dr prescribed a new med that I hope will help me feel normal again. I'd rather take my chances of getting of cancer (the reason I had to come off Estradiol) than live the rest of my life as this horrible person I have become.

I allowed my doctor to put me on this because it was easier to believe he knew what he was doing, not realizing what would happen in the long run.  1. There is a difference in the generic and the original...don't be fooled into thinking otherwise. 2.  You will become addicted to this drug as they will keep upping your dosage until it is hell with withdrawals that are incredibly hard to go through if you have anything else wrong with you.  3.  This drug effects more than just your mood...you lose your drive to do most anything over time.  Forget your sexual drive, you will become almost zombie as far as your emotions are concerned or you will experience worsening of your symptoms.  4.  Oh yes it can ""help"" you, but in the long run it hurts you more  This drug is just an almost automatic for some healthcare systems (do they get a ""kickback"" for using this drug to treat their patients?).

My doctor is trying to switch this one to another dangerous drug so I am going off this drug slowly and this is my second week in hell.  Nausea, dizzy, dis-orientation, sleeplessness and memory lapses not to mention finally I am starting to mourn my husband's death.  

This drug simply makes you complacent so your doctor doesn't have to think about you and your healthcare provider certainly never did!

DON'T GET HOOKED ON THIS DRUG!  DON'T ALLOW YOUR DOCTOR TO GET YOU HOOKED TO A DRUG SIMPLY FOR HIS CONVENIENCE AND OBAMACARE'S COMPLACENCY TO BIG GOVERNMENT PHARMACEUTICAL!  If you value loving and caring about your life and the others in it, than never allow your doctor to become your ""pusher""!"

Now on Medicare (disabled), back to Venlafaxine for 7 years. My current dose is 450 mg per day.  That's right. One 150mg pill in the morning, two at night. Upped to 450 after depression got bad again. Now I rarely sleep, but would give up my right arm if I could. Still depressed, but lack the energy to kill myself. If I screw up taking it on time, then you can mark 1 or 2 days off the calendar, bc I'm so tired I'm incoherent. Not sleeping tho. Just sitting around like a bowl of jello. Sounds terrible, but it is the lesser evil. See PCP next month and am going to make some changes. IF I remember, that is. Other daily meds-(3)15mg morphine for back/hip pain, levothyroxine for thyroid, pravastatin for cholesterol and nabumetone.

I started taking because of seasonal depression and am the heaviest I have ever been in my life.   I have picked up 35 lbs while taking this drug.   When I initially starting taking this, I took it in the morning and it made me VERY tired.   I switched to taking it right before bed and that worked out well for me.  I have experience a serious increase in sweating and hot flashes.   When I miss a dose, get out of my way.   Serious dizziness and I have a hairpin trigger for getting pissed off.  I have been trying for three weeks to get off of this drug (by a gradual reduction in dosage) during the summer and the only thing I can say is the physical withdrawal I am experiencing is beyond severe.  Short temper, episodes of increased anger, dizziness and nausea, sleeplessness,   I am contemplating staying on the drug to avoid the withdrawal symptoms.    You have to decide which is worse, the depression or the side effects of the drug, if they apply to you.

It did not work as well as Cymbalta.  He increased mg. it made everything worse as I was as taking nortripline and clonazepam. It was also getting to expensive to go to him. So I started removing myself off venfaxine. Reducing dosage very slowly.  I did nave some withdrawals but nothing with depression.  I have been off for a month now. I am a lot happier, and not as tired and sleeping all the time.  I know the nortripline is still there but the cost of it is not as bad as the other.  I think the cost was also adding to my problem and anxiety.  I am going to keep in touch with my GP as he knows what I been taking.  I hope I did not make a mistake taking myself off it but I don't feel like I did.

I have very severe pain with Idiopathic Neuropathy, especially on my toes and end of both feet. On the other hand toes are very numb, but extremely sensitive to touch. Things I can no longer feel with my feet- if bath water is too hot, could not feel pain from five fire ant bites!, if wet on floor or carpet, I can't tell. Cut foot or bump- don't know it. But that little corn between my little toe and next one still hurts bad if not padded. The Venlafaxine works only a little, and I am religious to take it twice daily at same time. Doc finally gave me Lidocaine patches for severe pain days...that helps some too. I do not understand if so many people have this condition, why don't they have a good effective treatment for it. The pain has really effected my lifestyle. Can't go to the store anymore cause walking around is just too painful. Vacation to stroll around and look, no way. Entertaining clients in my work, doesn't happen any more. I hate this and my neurologist seems to not hear my complaints. Do I really have to use the wheelchair I recently bought to be able to go grocery shopping for the rest of my life? More research is needed to find an effective drug for this very painful and dangerous condition. Help!

Overall, the benefits completely outweigh the negatives. Regarding all the negative reviews, I think that this drug works very well for very specific people - if you think it might work for you at least try it out (with assistance from your doctor, in case you need to ween yourself back off) because it has been a god send for me.

That's when the problems started!! First I was exhausted all day so I started taking it at night. Then after 2 weeks I woke up with slight facial swelling in my chin. By the end of the day my chin and bottom lip were huge and I had massive hives all over my body! Not knowing I went to a allergist who didn't think it was a drug allergy so we did blood work and put me on prednisone for 5 day. Well at day 5 the hives were gone but I had started taking my mess again so of course the hives came right back. I since saw my counselor and he switched my meds to wellbutrine 200 mg. I can't say it's working as well but I thankfully don't have hives!!!

It takes about 24 to 36 hours to start feeling something like jolts or shocks through my body. I was on 75mg now down to the 37mg now i'm going off of it. I'm sure many people could benefit from this drug unfortunately I am not one of you. I truly hate thinking/believing a pill can solve my problems without me having to get my hands dirty so to speak. Thats what counseling is for. I have never hoped for a miracle pill I just want something that can kick me out of that funk. So i'm not upset that this drug didn't change my life. This drug didn't give me a dulled or baseline feeling (no high highs or deep lows) which was what kept me on it for so long. Sometimes it hard to tell whats working and you don't want to stop taking it and find out it was doing the lion's share of the work. I would also caution everyone to take any review of (5 star or 1 star) from people within a week of treatment the placebo/expectation effect can be very misleading. I am only sharing this because I have been on it for a long period to explain its effects on me. extra info I'm 30 on lisinopril/hctz for high blood pressure. Ritalin 20mg. Bupropion 200mg. Hope someone finds this helpful. And I hope everyone finds something that helps you make it through the day.

This is the 4th pill I have tried to eliminate my anxiety. I will say as far as my anxiety goes this pill has been very effective at removing my anxiety but it has made me less effective as a person. One of the first things I noticed when starting it was the constant hot flashes and sweating. After 4 months I noticed my thoughts were foggy but as long as I really focused I could get by at work. I also had my blood pressure increas so much I had to star taking pills for that as well. I also have frequent migraines, weight gain and tiredness. As I said it has been 1 year now and my mind has gotten so foggy and I have become so irritable that I am going to request my doc take me off it and we try something else before I lose my job or my family.

I often jolted awake from my sleep while taking it, and those spasms got worse as the early morning progressed.  I often felt tired even if I slept okay.  It increased my appetite and gave me flashes of lightheadedness.  It didn’t help my depression much.  I felt kinda anxious, and at most I felt emotionless, not happy.  So I didn’t stay on it long.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

125$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$8/17/2013 11:40:09 AM$Reviewer: Henry2010, 65-74 Male  (Patient) $5$5$5$I had been with a psychiatrist for nine years.  I suffered from severe depression and anxiety.  He tried a variety of anti-depressants all from the same family.  The last medication was Lexapro.  He kept me on this medication for six months even though adjusting the dosage had no effect on relieving my depression.  He did not keep up with research and was disorganized.  In May 2012, I decided to change psychiatrists.  Two people referred me to a new psychiatrist.  I contacted her office in May 2012 and was put on a waiting list.  I finally began seeing her in early June 2012.  She told me there were a variety of medications that we could try.  She adjusted my medications, but the most important change she made was to put me on the generic for Effexor ER which she told me was from a different family of anti-depressants.  Within three months, I began to feel better.  Now 13 months later, I feel very well and glad to be alive.  I no longer to to bed early and stay in bed in the morning.  I get up early (I was an early riser for most of my life.)  I am happily engaged in many activities and look forward to each new day.  I know that life presents problems for all of us but that I have the skills and new confidence to tackle them.  I know that I must not stop taking Effexor ER and that I must remain on medications for the rest of my life.  I will continue to see this excellent psychiatrist.  She is very organized.  She has a computer on her desk which she uses to keep up with research, detail her patients' records, submit claims to Medicare or insurance companies, and order electronically most of my medications from my pharmacy.  Effexor XR has been effective for me.

I can miss a dose by about 24hrs and have migraine headaches, dizziness, nausea, and irritability, and sometimes I feel like my brain is shaking.  As long as I take the medication as directed and on time the only bothersome side effects I have are increased sweating/hot flashes and random muscle twitch mostly occurring at bed time. Overall, I love how this medication works for my depression and anxiety issues. That completely out weighs the side effects of a missed dose.

This worked very well for suppressing most of my conditions, but not 100% like I would like it to.
I started out on 50 mg, move up over 6 months to 150 mg I am currently at now and have noticed the side effects are drastically effecting my everyday life.

It has reduced the overall amount of panic attacks, and my depression to a manageable point. But has worsening my anxiety levels, I get daily hot flashes/sweats, impulsive actions, severe restlessness, and very rapid speech to name a few.

I have sever Sleep Apnea and since starting this, my overall amount of sleep has decreased from 6.75 hrs. a night to 4 hrs. or less a night. Even with taking Ambient CR 12.5 mg it doesn't help.

As with any medication, it effects everyone differently, I'm only posting this info so it might help someone else.

I'm currently researching if I should lower my current 150 mg dose and add BuSpar. Hopefully I can figure out a balance.

166$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/5/2012 10:07:40 PM$Reviewer: Linnea, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I started taking Venlafaxine 2 weeks ago. The last 3 days I have been able to tell the difference in a great, great way.

I had been suffering insomnia, OCD habits, and extreme anxiety attacks every other week on average.  After a 12 hour anxiety attack I cut off my hair with a crayola brand scissors and went to the doctor the next day. I'm giving this information to characterize how extreme my anxiety attacks were getting. I didn't feel like I was in my own body anymore. I felt out of my mind, out of control. This had been happening since June 2011. I went to the doctor finally September 2012. I am now falling asleep when I want to fall asleep, I haven't had an anxiety attack and I don't feel anxious at all, and I feel like I can control my OCD habits. The last is still strugglesome but I believe that I can do it now. I have coherent thoughts. I tell myself ""just one thing at a time"" and I can do it. I have comlete control over my actions and behavior. I'm getting my online schooling done early, not last minute. Everything is going great. 

As for side effects - the first 4 days I was sicker than hell. (stomach wise) So, if you are ready to start taking Venlafaxine, I recommend not to do so on the beginning of a work week. Instead, try starting on a saturday or a day off of work. Take it in the morning. Drink a full tall glass of water with each dose and something else in your stomach for it to absorb. 

I hope that this medication works for anyone reading this as much as it has for me. I am so happy that I decided to go to the doctor. I have control over my life now and I am very optimistic about my future. I plan to stay on this medication until I finish my bachelors degree. "

I was prescribed a low dose of Venlafaxine which was supposed to gradually increase to replace the Bupropion I am taking.  I took my medications around 8 - 9 AM.  Around 10 - 10:30 AM I started feeling so sick and dizzy I actually started crying.  I felt like I was going to die and I didn't know if I was going to be able to drive to work.

PRO's: i'm calm, no more anxiety and panic attaches. i can go out to the malls, big cities, large building without feeling anxious.i can be myself like everyone else. the drug has given my LIFE back. I LUV this drug. I'll be taking it the rest of my life, but thats OK with me. CON's: Blurred Vision and low sexual desires. These are the two main and worse symptoms that i don't like. but it looks like all the depession meds have these symptoms too. you can't miss or don't try to skip a dose. you'll get brain zaps that i can't stand. and don't try to wain yourself off unless your doctor knows and can assist you. try it you'll love it.

It worked fairly well but I was tired all the time and gained a little weight.  The weight gain could have been due to the gabapentin that I was on at the same time.  When I went off the gabapentin and stayed on this med I did start loosing weight.  I just wasn't happy with this med because I was ""dulled"" and did feel happy.

I always masked and avoided well and did my suffering in private. I have held very responsible jobs but fought myself all the way. Menopause, two deaths in the family, my husband in surgery and a new job that didn't fit triggered a major deppressive episode and I began treatment. Effexor XR and then the generic venlafaxine has enabled me to lead a great life on the inside as well as the out.
I take 225 mg in the morning. If I forget I am in trouble by 2 - 3 o'clock with the withdrawal symptoms we all know and hate. So, I don't forget and I always carry spares with me.
I do have other side effects, my sex drive is reduced to almost zero, I sleep very poorly, I don't have as much energy as I would like BUT none of those things is anywhere near as devastating as the black hole of depression. I exercise, eat well, associate with positive, active people and now retired indulge myself in things I enjoy. 
I no longer see a psychiatrist, my family doctor manages my meds. I did wean off the med about 5 years ago. It took about 6 months. My psychiatrist handled it by reducing 37.5 mg every month and then when we reached 37.5 mg he had a pharmasist make 18.75 capsules and I got off. Three months later I had a major episode and I will never fool myself into thinking that my depression is cured again. 
I am on Venlafaxine for life and while I don't like it I would be dead by suicide if I were not.

My doctor prescribed this for me because I lack any energy or ambition and all I want to do is sleep! Basically I've suddenly become lazy which I have NEVER been! In the last 4 days the only irritating side effect I've noticed is dry mouth but this is also a side affect of Suboxone which I have been on for 2 years. It's gotten a bit worse so probably a little of both. The only other side affect that I have noticed (and am certainly not complaining about) is the loss of appetite. I literally have eaten 3 meals in the last 4 days and have no hunger or urge to snack!! For me this is a blessing! I usually eat and get hungry all the time! I weigh 225lbs and am told that I am morbidly obese! So perhaps this will work as a weight loss alternative? We'll see! I will repost when it kicks in and let you know how it works for me!

I have social anxiety disorder, depression, and extreme anxiety. I found that this medication has been the best out of all other the many meds I have been on for 12 years. My only complaints are the headachs and the sleeping problems it causes at first. I currently don't take it because I am pregnant and I can really tell the difference in my attitude and mood (not caused by the pregnancy). I really wish I could take it so I can feel normal again.

I can only take it on Friday afternoons and usually sleep late Saturday morning.  During Saturdays, I nap if I don't go outside to work or am up moving around.  I can't sit and do any work (search the web, read, play a board game with the kids)or I'll fall asleep.  I'm back to normal by Sunday.  The depression is under control so I tolerate the sleepiness.

It helped to relieve me from severe anxiety and depression.  Recently I had eye surgery for a cataract.  The operation was a disaster and I lost my lens, the bag the lens fits in, and it damaged my retina.  I became so depressed I could hardly get out of bed.  I resumed taking Venlafaxine and the depression and anxiety begin to diminish.  Corrective surgery is scheduled for September 14, 2011.  After that, I will probably wean myself of this medication.

I was diagnosed in 1995 and have tried many different meds.  To me they all have side effects. Is it worth tolerating for the overall benefit?  I have experienced most of the stated side effects, but will tolerate them until I can afford the effexor xr again.  My depression is much worst than even the brain zap side effects.  My main frustration is the insurance company's manipulation of our health care.  They should want to help us get better--not pricing us into cheap ineffective care!  I recommend effexor, it really helps me.

My doctor explained that fybromyalgia symptons could be a result of lack of sleep or vise versa.  Well, the meds work great for helping me sleep better, therefore I am better rested and the pain symptoms disappear.  Some advice that I have found to be helpful:  always take it after a good breakfast or lunch to prevent the sick feeling.  DOn't take in the evening as it will lead to sleep issues.  Don't try to take a nap after you have takeen it, or you won't be able to get up! As long as I keep busy I am fine.  I have gained 25lbs, so have decided to reduce my dosage slowly and go off the meds again. I originally was on it for about 1.5 yrs, I was doing great so went off it.  They withdrawels are hard, but if you do it slowly its not unbearable.  It was nearly 2 yrs before my symptoms returned, and I went back on it.

I was unproductive and severely depressed for several days and it took several weeks to become stable.  I was scared and very ill.  If you are needing help with your depression please know that the withdrawl procedure is very important and very difficult.  I also had decreased sex drive, weight gain and it really didn't do the trick for me overall.  Wellbutrin is far easier and more effective for me.

I was previously on the Effexor XR when switched to the product by TEVA I had severe side effects, headaches, crying, deepened depression, suicidal thoughts etc.  
Due to insurance changes I have been changed to 50 mg 3 times a day rather then the extended release.  This new product is manfactured by a different company and seems to be working well.  
I did report both to TEVA and the FDA my reactions to their medication. Although the active ingredient is the same, there is something in the xr pill by TEva that I could not metabolize therefore it was just as if I was on no medication at all.

After using the brand name Effexor XR capsules for 5 years without any problems and with good results in terms of alleviating depression, my pharmacy decided to switch me to this oblong orange capsule generic (even though it was the same price as brand name).  After using this generic for 3 weeks, I noticed that it was not working well in controlling depression and I heard/felt that ""whooshing/brain zap"" in my brain that others have described. Worst of all, I experienced a horrible serontin syndrome the 4th week, so I immediately called my dr. and he switched me back to the brand name, red Effexor XR capsules. My neurologist and my friend who works at a pharmaceutical company told me to beware of generics, because they are NOT the same as the brand name; their manufacturers are not held to the same stringent regulations in order to produce their drugs, the manufacturers are not required to use the full percentage of active ingredients, formulations and potency can vary, etc. You truly get what you pay for!"

When taking this med you should take it at the same time every day, and never let the med run out because the withdrawal side effects are not nice. Vertigo, dizziness, and what I like to call brain zaps a very unpleasant feeling in your head. It is very difficult for me to be weaned off so now I take a very low dose every day. When I say weaned off, your doc. has to subscribe a lower dose, that you take less and less of for 1 to 2 weeks. You cannot quit cold turkey because it will mess you up.
275$Condition: Depression$2/1/2011 10:27:20 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$2$5$"It has taken me a very long time to realize that my night sweats, hyperhidrosis, agitation, constant yawning and other problems are all due to the Effexor XR/Venlafaxine. I have complained to my doctors about these things and all I get is a blood work up and then nothing. My tests always come out fine, but not one single doctor has made the connection between this drug and those severe side effects. My psychiatrist didn't even know what ""brain zaps"" were. I am becoming very discrouraged with the medical community and the lack of proper help. I recently switched to the generic because of my insurance change and the side effects are the same. I get these side effects constantly, but especially if I am a little late on my dosage. I cannot stand that fact that I am a prisoner to this drug and I may never get off of it. It made a difference 13 years ago when I was a teenager, with my depression and anxiety, but had I known then all that I know now, I would never have gotten on this drug. I have read that people like me who eventually wean down to 25mg or so have the ""discontinuation syndrome"" for years, that's if it ever goes away. And please be aware- their new drug ""Pristiq"" is the same thing!! It is call DEvenlafaxine, and has the same side effects....I want to get this out there so other don't go through this hell!!!"

On the first day of the medicine, not only was I dizzy, but I forgot how to read for 5 seconds. Not that good of a thing to happen on the highway.  Earlier that day, I tried to set my digital alarm clock to wake me up, and granted I couldn't fall asleep, when I looked over at my desired 'wake up' time, i noticed why the thing didn't go off--I was still in the settings! There was many incidences that lead to 'moments' tied to this medicine, because I had even asked my brother what batteries a printer took to receive remote access functions. Sadly this is one medicine that won;t so much fix your (problem) as it would make you forget everything else and turn it into unbearable frustration. Here, normally, people come to me for help, and this medicine made me forget the names of the people I live with---even my own husband! I think you should consult your doctor on a trial before taking this medicine, because i'm certainly going to... if I remember to call him tomorrow, since I forgot to today.

I spoke with my pharmacist re this reaction and she has heard of no other reactions like mine with the use of this generic. She said some people just don;t feel that a generic works as well.  I am not one of those people, believe me.  I would much rather pay a $3.00 co-pay than a $30.00 one. She said that my BCBS may not be willing to pay for me to get Effexor now that a proven generic is out. I have to call my Dr. tomorrow as I do not feel that I can continue to take this med.

Also if I'm even a couple hours late taking it in the morning I feel nauseous, dizzy and anxious. I tried to go off it once and it was horrible. I'm sort of worried about the long term effects of my high dosage. As for drinking, the only weird reaction I have is that i don't feel the alcohol as much.

I continue to feel very depressed on the inside, but outwardly I think I pull of a pretty good cover.   It's as if there are no other options.   I suffer from epilepsy (controlled with meds for 18 yrs.) and migraine headaches.   I do believe that there is a huge difference in some of the name brand drugs and generic drugs with regard to effectiveness, but pharmacists, my doctors and insurance company continually state that all these drugs have the same active ingredients and one is just as effective as the other, but at lower costs; I disagree.  I think it has more to do with money than my actual well being.   I've complained for years of low libido and increased weight (about 75 lbs. over the last 10 years) and no one seems interested in assisting me with these problems.   Yet, if I complained of chest pain, you can bet, I'd get all kinds of tests to get to the bottom of that problem.

I sweat like crazy at night. It says to take with food but it takes away your appetite so you go 2 days not eating only to lay in bed naseaus with diareaha. Xanax is the only thing that helps though I was told it's only a crutch and won't help with my panic attacks long term. After this pill my doctor gave up on me and told me to see a phyciatrist.

This is the single worst medication I have ever been on. It causes severe vertigo which prevents me from even leaving the house which is the reason I started taking it in the first place. Otherwise, it has given me night sweats, horrific dreams (think about the movie saw only being able to experience the pain associated with it).

It works but there are many side effects.  About 2 years after starting it, I had to start taking high blood pressure medication. My heart has developed a murmur. And now, after over 10 years, my hands shake. I suppose there will be more along the way.
My depression is there but it no longer takes over my life. I have had to learn good coping techniques. If I stay up past midnight, some hyper something happens and I am up all night. I can tell when I have missed a dose but take a pill right away when that happens and the symtoms go away. The worst side effect has been a slowly worsening loss of memory and that started day one. 
I will probably take this the rest of my life. I hate it but it makes me able to live a life. "

I broke out in hives head to toe and I never had an allergy prior. I had to stop taking it immediately and the withdrawal symptoms were horrific. For the last 10 months I have been on several drug combinations in an attempt to get rid of the hives. I've been on a immune-suppressant drug called cyclosporine for the last six. This is also a dangerous medication, but the only thing that would control the hives. Unfortunately, many people suffer from chronic hives/edema after taking this medication. See here for more stories: http://depression.about.com/b/2009/07/31/forum-ef fexor-xr-and-hives.htm#gB3 I strongly recommend not EVER taking this medication as the lasting effects have destroyed any normalcy in my life for the last 10 months. Although it is not listed as a common side-effect, my allergist said that 3-4% of people do have some sort of reaction and that he sees several each year with hives. Also, it can take 1-3 years for your immune system to recover so the hives go away. I will regret the day I began taking this medication for the rest of my life.

I am very terrified about the withdrawl effects of me just abruptly stopping this medication, because I didn't sleep a wink last night, I was covered in sweat and had to change clothes twice during the night, along with having crazy nightmares, but that is what my Dr. said to do, so I have no clue what else I can do, I need the itching and red bumps and swelling and misery to go away!

Other than dry throat and some loss of appetite, no side effects for me. Within 5 days I was feeling better—no longer waking up early in the morning with my heart beating out of my chest and terrified, as I have been on and off for years. I feel calmer and don't worry as much. I would like to stay at this low dosage as the results have been great and I don't like taking medications for anything anyway. I still haven't regained my full appetite, which sucks, as I am a real 'foodie', but the tradeoff is worth it. I see many comments on here regarding the expense of Effexor vs. the generic. Just to let you know that in my province in Canada, with an employers medical program, 2 weeks of Venlafaxine cost me less than $4."

The XR made me less sleepy and was easier to take (one each evening with a little snack). I went on the generic because of the cost. It's helped me greatly with panic disorder and depression. I've been able to deal with stress and residual depressive symptoms with exercise, relationships and eating better. I get a little more nauseous with the generic, too, but I just have to eat something when I take my meds to make that manageable. I would go back to the XR in a minute if I could afford it, but at least I can live my life with minimal side effects and no panic attacks.

Whether it was psychosomatic or not, I felt relief immediately on taking the first 25 mg tab.

Then, also with rapid onset, it began to give me hot flashes (which I left behind several years ago). I realize that Venlafaxine is sometimes prescribed to relieve hot flashes, but it had the opposite effect on me.

Scrip said to increase dose by 25 mg every 5 days to max of 50 mg in AM and 50 mg in PM.

I decided to stick with the extremely low 25 mg dose once/day for just over two weeks, and then increase by a half tab.

I felt myself slip back into depression, and of course, the hot flashes remained.

I called the doctor to report on this, and he prescribed Trazodone instead.

I was on Venlafaxine for about one month.

We'll see how Trazodone works..."

I have noticed an improvement in mood and energy level.  It makes me a little nauscious and light-headed when I take it so I take it with a meal to reduce those symptoms.  At this point I would say the benefits outweigh those mild side effects.  One other weird thing: Huge loss of appetite.  I still eat healthfully, but I'm just not as obsessed with food as I used to be.  I've lost a lot of weight.  So far I would recommend it  :)

( at night mostly ) My mood has def. improved. I don't feel annoyed like I did with Prozac. I'm not snapping at people like I was. 
I was reluctant to use Effexor due to some of the negative reviews I read but since I had success last year using Cymbalta 
( which is similiar to Effexor but more expensive ) I figured it was worth trying.

When I missed one dose I went into a withdrawal-like (""discontinuation"") syndrome.  Brain zaps. anxiety, nausea, and more.  I was able to reduce the dose over a long period of time, then switched to the generic immediate release.  I am stuck at 50 mg am and 25 mg pm.  Every time I try to cut back I go into the ""discontinuation syndrome"".  I hate to think I'm going to be stuck on this all my life!  Occasionally I do forget to take my meds, especially if I'm away from home.  When I forget to take the morning meds, I'm in the discontinuation syndrome state by that evening. Than it's too late to do anything about it.

Miserable.  

I have contacted the FDA and the manufacturer.  I still haven't heard anything back.

Also, my Medicare Part D provider has decided to raise the GENERIC venlafaxine to tier 2, which means I will pay full price from now until the end of the year.  Yet I can't get off the med.  What to do?

I could tell a difference within a week of having started even the lowest dose.  Missed two doses due to a stomach virus at one point and the effects of withdrawal were immediate and severe.  I'm very careful to take it at exactly the same time every day, and with food.  It has helped me regain focus and experience less stress at work and at home.

I felt panicked at school like I was going to do/say something wrong & get in trouble.  At 38,although I had made it to a supervising position, I still doubted everything I did. I overworked because I never thought I was doing good enough until I finally became so exhausted and lost contact with reality. Hospitalized for 3 weeks I was tried on several things with different side effects.
Now I have been on Effexor for 13 yrs (as Venlafaxine for the last year).
1 yr my dr chgd me to XR but realized it cost lots more then regular release so I switched back.
Generic seems no different to me.
I get nauseous only if I don't eat within 15 min of taking a dose.
Memory & concentration are better since I don't worry all the time except when I am having my period, then both are flighty.
I have noticed repeatedly that if I take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol, it seems to block my anti-depressant. Several days of Ibuprofen would cause the return of depression, sadness & anxiety. I stick with Tylenol & I am fine.
The first years I took 3x37.5mg a day, about 4 yrs ago I moved down to 2x37.5mg and then only 1x37.5mg a day.  Mainly because of $. For me, I found 1x3.75 good for 3 wks a mth but needed 2x37.5 during my period week. Or if something extra stressfull happened like a death, a car accident, or moving.
Taking this drug gave me relief from my depression so I could work through my problems. The drug can't fix me all by itself but I couldn't move on into improving myself without its help.
I am very gratefull for the greater enjoyment I can feel in life now.

I know it's this medication because if I go a day without it, I'm not sick. But of course I can't keep that up! I take 200mg a day so stopping now is not an option. I am switching back to the Brand name capsules regardless of the cost. The generic pills are so bitter, it's like swallowing gall and I think that has something to do with the horrible nausea.

My doctor switched me to the generic brand (Venlafaxine 75mg) It seemed to increase my libido, but I yawn all the time, concentration and memory is way out of wack, and night sweats are horrible. Doctor is now trying to wean me off this med., currently taking 37.5mg, every other day but hate the dizzinesss and gittery feeling, possibly due to withdrawl. Hopefully, that will soon pass. The venlafaxine also seemed to make me a little irritable.
433$Condition: Depression$6/23/2008 4:01:47 AM$Reviewer: ST, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$I have become totally dependant on 150gms per day. Tried to reduce dosage by lowest possible level (even by cutting 37.5gm tablets in half) numerous times but my brain reacts severely - within hours if alternate day reduction used or within a few days if reduction over longer than alternate days. Withdrawal is so bad that my entire body becomes unable to function at all and all I can do is sleep or move around slowly. Symptoms of depression seem to return but I am convinced this is due to drug dependency. Doctors advise to remain dependent on the drug. My feelings are: 1.The drug has been progressively reducing the ability of my brain to function. 2. Since taking the drug, while I am generally happy and generally functioning well, the level of my brain activity and ability has reduced dramatically. I am not always able to think clearly. 3. My memory has become totally unreliable, to the point that I can be convinced a conversation never took place or that I did not receive information that had infact been given to me. I have tried to change to a different antidepressant but this has caused the same effects as a dosage reduction.

Within first week, felt improved. After that side effects of dizziness, disassociation, lethargy, and extensive sleeping kicked in. I miss work all the time because I can't wake up and when I do, I feel disoriented. I cut back to 37.5mg once daily and noticed a very small improvement. Currently working with my doctor to find something else.
This is the first time I have had issues like these with a drug and it scares me. I really plan to research the next drug I am prescribed before I begin taking it!"
435$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$5/22/2008 4:15:52 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $3$3$4$"My husband has been taking the Venlafaxine for a few years.  In all the reviews I read I did not see anyone talk about long term.
I did notice that some of the review talked about nausea, my husband actually vomits at least once a day.  He was also on another med for muscle spasm that he stopped due to the awful side effects.  During this time he would vomit at least 3-4 times a day.  has anyone else experienced actual vomitting and not just the nausea feeling.
Concerned as his appetite is absolutely nill at this point."

I would not recommend it to anyone.
The side effects are wicked. It works for some people, but for me it was a total waste of money.

I don't notice the loss of extended release.This med along with buspirone allows me to keep a balance between depression and angst. They allow the calm middle ground for me. I am glad for that.HM>

444$Condition: Depression$2/16/2008 11:27:08 AM$Reviewer:  , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$1$3$I was taking 150ml for about 6 months, then in June started taking 300ml.  The side effects slowly crept up all at once. Could not stand being in my body, once I saw all the side effects...I had ALL of them.  Was seeing a psychristrist.  I stopped taking (cut back slowly) and I am fine.  I would recommend it, but watch the side effects, hard to explain a blinding headache, dizziness, very angry, while shaking and thinking something is wrong (anxiety).
