1$Condition: Depression$12/20/2019 10:44:07 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking Zoloft after I was diagnosed with depression. After experiencing the sexual side effects of that drug, trouble coming to climax, I was switched to Lexapro. The side effect mentioned wasn't nearly as severe and my mood and outlook improved dramatically. This medication has changed my life for the better. I have a better relationship with my wife and friends, my job performance has improved significantly as well.

4$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$10/15/2019 3:53:35 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My doctor prescribed this due to my concern over constantly crying over stressful situations (due to anxiety and major depression) and it was happening on a daily basis. It was so bad that I couldn't work. The Lexapro really helped rather quickly. I'd say within a week or two I started noticing changes. I still think the same but I can brush things off that normally would make me cry. I pretty much feel like I things don't bother me as severely as they did. Sure, I still get sad and feel down at times, but they don't make me feel like it's the end of the world and I don't cry whenever I feel stressed. 
5$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/11/2019 3:09:38 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$Don't let all the bad reviews scare you--Lexapro has given me my life back. I was having almost daily panic attacks in grad school, it was so bad I considered dropping out. But then I got prescribed Lexapro and saw an instant improvement. Even from day 1 my mood was better and more stable, and by the end of two weeks my panic attacks had completely vanished. My doctor had me start at a very low dose and slowly increase to my full dose over a two-week period. I noticed mild headaches on the days I upped the dosage, and I had increased daytime sleepiness for the first month, but I've had no other side effects aside from mild headaches if I accidentally miss a dose. Totally worth it for me, it's made me so much happier and healthier!
6$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/6/2019 10:07:28 AM$Reviewer: anonymous , 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$When i first started using the medication it didn’t help anything, but after about 2 weeks, i noticed an increase in motivation and overall happiness.  i didn’t have as much trouble wanting to get out of bed in the morning, and i didn’t cry or panic daily like i had previously.  however, i still get really angry just like previously.  it didn’t help the anger associated with my bipolar.  it just helped with the sadness.  i didn’t have any side effects, which is great because most medicines i react with in some way.
7$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/13/2019 1:36:15 PM$Reviewer: T561, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Iâ??ve never written a review on anything before but lexapro has changed my life. I used to not even be able to stay at work because my anxiety would be so bad that I would feel like passing out, get dizzy, my head would throb, heart wouldnâ??t stop racing, and constantly get hot flashes. When I first started taking lexapro the first week was kinda rough it made me really anxious a few times and was kinda hard to sleep/ I would wake up often in the night. But after about 2-3 weeks I started noticing how much better I was. I used to not even be able to go to the store because it was so bad and now I can go to the store when itâ??s busy, go to work perfectly fine, and I know everyone reacts different to these things but itâ??s the first thing Iâ??ve ever taken and it is working great for me. 
8$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/19/2019 1:31:46 PM$Reviewer: bradak, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$"I'm very satisfied with Lexapro.  I had a mental breakdown around the 4th of July due to two tragedies in the family, and heightened day to day stresses.  I kept going into the ER thinking I was having a heart attack or stroke and they kept calling it anxiety / panic attacks.  Got with my primary doctor and he prescribed me 10mg/day Lexapro.  I had severe issues my first week and a half of Lexapro including no appetite, constant nausea, fell asleep easy but would wake up through-out the night, sometimes awake for hours.  Very vivid dreams. Panic attacks continued, but they were less frequent and less severe.  This all passed by about day 21.  I haven't had any of these symptoms in about 3 weeks.  Doctor told me he likes to get people on Lexapro long before I started it.  So what i learned was open up with your doctor, be honest.

I had a diary I started which had paragraphs each day documented when I had bad days, but after the 3 week mark they are few and far between, due mostly to this pill."

I had been on Celexa before but it didn't seen ""strong"" enough for my level of anxiety. I have been on 10mg of Lexapro for a few months now and it's been amazing. I have even been able to taper down on my benzodiazepine with Lexapro (and all natural supplements/vitamins). I highly recommend giving Lexapro a try. BUT remember, not all meds work for all people. It may just take you a while to find one that works best for you. Don't give up!!! "

11$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/21/2019 11:11:59 PM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$I'm writing this review on every site I can find in hopes that it will help somebody going through what I went through on this drug. I was prescribed lexapro for some moderate anxiety I was having caused by a physical injury. I took the first 10mg pill in the morning and that night had a full blown panic attack. I had never experienced anything like that prior. I took one more pill the next morning and it led to the 4 worst days of my life. I couldn't eat or sleep and certainly couldn't work. My mind was racing non stop and the anxiety was ceaseless and I broke down crying several times. I spent all day pacing around my living room terrified that this change was somehow permanent, I was going to lose my job and my life was over. I took four days for the medication to leave my system and I was myself again. If you are experiencing this, just hang in there! It will get better again!
12$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$5/23/2019 7:26:52 AM$Reviewer: KamJ, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$3$The initial sensation feels like a chemical is working against the natural order of things.. not working against depression per say.. although, it definitely will start to give a very warm and fuzzy feeling.. which is so needed for those who are hugely depressed. My greatest complaint is that.. even alongside mirtazapine..and just taken during the day.. it completely wiped out the effects of the very effective mirtazapine for sleep.. and I could not sleep all night. Had to discontinue right away. Might effect tonight also. Some people it might not do this to them.. just did it to me. Thanks!

My doctor prescribed Lexapro 5mg. I was taking at night before bed which did help with falling asleep. After about 1 week of taking it I started having strange thoughts, that made me nervous.

By the 25th day I couldn't handle it any longer and I called my doctor and stopped the medication.

About 4 months into taking it, I became even more depressed then I have ever been. I would cry every single day and nothing in my life at the time was a result of my overwhelming emotions. Once I realized this wasnâ??t normally me, I went back to the doctor. They changed my dosage. I was feeling good for a while but now Iâ??m just as anxious as I was before the medication and having panic attacks again, and I donâ??t feel like myself. This medication has made me even more depressed then Iâ??ve ever been in my life, and itâ??s almost like Iâ??ve adjusted and am feeling just as anxious. Iâ??ve talked with many others that have taken lexapro and they also werenâ??t satisfied with the effects of the drug. They didnâ??t have my exact experience but similar ones. If you take this drug, I suggest really checking in with yourself to make sure youâ??re feeling better and not worse.

26$Condition: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder$12/17/2018 3:33:54 AM$Reviewer: Ahmed, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have always suffered with Severe Pure O OCD, it had severely impacted almost every single aspect of my life which lead me to severe crippling Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Panic Disorder and Mild Depression. I tried numerous types of Medication, even the BIG ONE - Anafranil, I remained on this medication for several months on a high dosage, it assisted with the OCD (not so much with Anxiety) however the side effects were utterly terrible so decided to give it up. My psychiatrist suggested Lexapro, began on 5mg and slowly work my way up to 30mg (currently on this dosage for the last three months). Pros: Anxiety has greatly reduced, very few panic attacks, hasn't stopped the thoughts however they have become much easier to brush off, I am able to think more rationally, and I feel somewhat more hopeful and optimistic. Cons: Constantly tired, extremely sleepy (I could sleep all day if I wanted to) and at times I feel somewhat emotionally numb.

Felt like I had the flu for the first week and on the 3rd night, did not sleep a wink. Lost 3 pounds in a week because I had no appetite. Never felt like I was in a deep sleep, more like twilight sleep. Finally stopped because I have a demanding job, and could not be be half asleep during the day. 
Maybe this works for some, but decided my anexirty is not severe enough to be on a potent mind altering drug with terrible side effects. "
28$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/13/2018 5:42:02 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have had anxiety off and on for years, but it was always controllable. However, it became more and more progressive over the past few months where my anxiety would trigger full blown panic attacks. One day, I woke up feeling extremely anxious and it did not go away all day. The anxiety progressed so fast where I had episodes of trembling throughout the day, completely lost my appetite, and would even wake up in the middle of the night with extreme anxiety. the anxiety took over and It was all I could think about. It became so debilitating, just trying to go to the store was the hardest task in the world and I was terrified to do so. My anxiety triggered deep depression. I am usually very full of energy, work out, and happy. I have a full time job, and two young kids so I knew I had to see a doctor and get things figured out. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression. I am not one to take medicine and am usually scared to do so, but anything was worth a try at this point. I was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro and within a week, felt a difference. It has been 2.5 weeks now, and I feel like myself again and like I have my life back. The medicine helped with my anxiety first, so I still felt my depression until about the second week. I personally haven't experienced any crazy side effects yet, and feel a headache or a little weight gain (if that does happen) is way better than the extreme anxiety and depression I was battling. My Dr.'s goal is to slowly lower my dose after a few months until I am good to be completely off it, as she believes my diagnosis is situational. This medicine truly saved me and gave me my life back. You just have to stick with it!   
29$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/11/2018 1:09:15 AM$Reviewer: Angie, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I took Lexapro once, and I still have not gotten myself to take another dose. I was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro by my NP for anxiety and depression. I haven't taken any psychiatric medication since high school for my conditions. After I filled my prescription, I took my dose at 1pm. By 4pm, I was feeling elated, lightheaded, and had some stomach pains. By 6pm, I experienced severe dry mouth, excessive sweating, and remained lightheaded and hazy feeling. My heart was also beginning to race. By 9pm, along with the previous symptoms, my blood pressure was very high, my jaw was clenching, and leg muscles were cramping, and I was feeling short of breath. I felt wired. I felt like I had taken a small dose of ecstacy (speaking from personal experience). I was extremely uncomfortable and just wanted to sleep for work. By 11:30pm, I had my mother take me to the ER, and I was given IV saline and an Ativan. My blood pressure while in the ER was around 180/110, and my heart rate was 135. Around 2am, all of my adverse signs and symptoms subsided, I was discharged, and I was finally able to sleep. Be careful of Lexapro, as it is not meant for everyone. Because Lexapro is an SSRI, it can potentially cause something called ""SEROTONIN SYNDROME,"" which is what I experienced. It can also cause this syndrome from interactions with other medication, even as simple as Nyquil. I was told to just try to tough it out and keep taking the Lexapro because ""it will get better when my body adjusts to it,"" but I really do not want to risk going through that again. Make sure you talk with your doctor so that you are well-informed before starting this medication."

I realized that I was no longer obsessing over thoughts and that I could function very good. I didn't gain any weight over the last 3 years.

Usually, that amount of cigarettes would have caused me to pause the rythm a bit as I should have had headaches or other. Did not under this medication. I did stop since then though...

It took about 5-6 weeks of taking it before I felt the full effects, but I knew that going in, so I just had to be patient and wait it out. In the beginning I did experience weird side effects like yawning, but those went away early on.  I have not experienced weight gain, thankfully.  Basically I just feel better, and more like the happy person I was before I began having anxiety. As I stated, this is the third time I've been on Lexapro, so I know the difficulties with waiting for it to take effect, and the challenges with transitioning off the medication.  All that being said, I still feel it is a life saver as I was crippled with constant anxiety attacks and wasn't really functioning in my own life. This medication literally gave me my life back.

41$Condition: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder$6/20/2018 1:43:53 AM$Reviewer: xbrando7, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$4$As someone who has experienced anxiety, OCD, and depression since the 10th grade, I can say honestly that this is a great medicine. It doesn't get rid of my issues completely, but it allows me to get on with my day and enjoy life. It calms and regulates me enough to focus and make adjustments that I otherwise couldn't make. In terms of side-effects, I have taken similar medicines such as Zoloft, Luvox, and Prozac, and found this one to be the most tolerable, with the only complaint being headaches (which are treatable by other means). Among these, it has also been the most effective. While everyone responds differently, for someone who hasn't tried it or is looking for a different treatment I would recommend it.

When I moved schools the start of this year when I was sixteen I started getting panic attacks and was just not functioning at all. I just hated myself and was so angry with how I was. I got put on Lexapro 10mg and it has been the best decision I've ever made. Within the first half an hour of taking it I felt so much better. I got a bit of a high off it which apparently some people get. Also felt so calm like there was nothing in my head. After the first week it felt more normal. Now I love it life is just so much easier and I'm happier. I will probably be on it for a few years and to be honest I don't really want to get off it because it helps so much. Also though I don't want to be on it my whole life. Side effects I get are headaches and shaking/ jumpyness.

The old saying of ""why trade a headache for an upset stomach"" comes to mind. I think I'll have to settle for the tears of the mild depression, and take the advice of one commentor who said to take a natural route. I am hypothyroid, and live in an increasingly stressful environment, but with courage and fortitude, I can press on. And I say good luck to you all, too."

Walking across the floor and having my bladder open up with no warning. I felt zombie like. Couldnâ??t cry. Felt dead inside. In a way, that was acceptable to me, until my Mom died and I felt nothing. Got off after a long withdrawal period. Whoever said this isnâ??t addictive is crazy.

Sexually side effects have benefited me and can now get my partner off multiple times and really concentrate on the act of pleasing rather than trying to last lol. Hope this helps some I just recently switched to 20mg tablet once at night.

I was always in a bad mood & everything set me off. I started with 10mg & saw a slight improvement the first week. It wasn't until the Dr put me on 15mg about a month in that i really saw considerable improvement. Two months later i can honestly say I am am so happy to be on this medication. Everything just seems better. I am happy. I find joy in the things i used to. I look forward to social events. My mood is so much better. I did not gain weight. No sexual side affects.

I have noticed over the years I have gained a lot of belly fat. Did a little research to find out that weight gain is possible. I would say over the course of taking Lexapro I have gained 25 pounds and that got me thinking of stopping plus NO sex drive at all... I have been completely off for a week now and today is the first day of starting to feel better from coming off the med. The last 3 days have been hard due to the overwhelming feeling of being dizzy and tired. But all in all it was worth the side affects for helping me through the last 5 years..

When it became paralyzing, I started therapy. After 4 months of therapy & being against medication, I started to learn more about the illness, how it runs in my family & because the physical symptoms weren't going away I started Lexapro. 
For the first couple of months as I increased the dosage, I became extremely paranoid that I was going to become suicidal. The weird part was that I had never even thought about this before and never experienced symptoms of depression. I started to learn through therapy that it stemmed from my fear of losing control of my anxiety and myself and the worst case scenario of that would be killing myself. 
I then became extremely motivated to become the best version of myself that I could be. With more therapy, daily mental exercises, physical exercise and A LOT of hard work... I was able to shake the paranoid thoughts and have never appreciated life more than I do now. Lexapro helped with the physical symptoms but if you suffer from anxiety and panic disorder you still need therapy. The medication is just one part of the process. But with all of the hard work and a daily pep talk in the mirror, I am a completely different person than I was 1 year ago when I hit rock bottom. 
I see life different & I am so grateful for the little things because I once couldn't enjoy them because of my anxiety and physical sickness. For those who are suffering from anxiety, this is how I see it. Every day I may get a wave here & there but I can manage it and still be happy. If that is the worst thing I have to deal with that day, I will take it. Anxiety is 100% manageable and YOU HAVE CONTROL. It's all about really believing you have control and that YOU ARE NOT A VICTIM. I think it's really important we start more conversations about mental illness. We shouldn't be ashamed or afraid.I encourage all of you to keep preaching ways to overcome it"

This was the second drug I tried. This was also the worst drug I tried. It made my depression and anxiety so much worse. My panic attacks didn't get better. I kept taking it because my doctor thought it was some miracle drug and he said it would work and just to give it some time. I ended up in the hospital getting my stomach pumped because my depression/anxiety was so much worse I attempted suicide by overdose. People react to drugs differently to others and hopefully it's worked for some, but as for my experience, it made things much worse.

Everyone has to find what works for them, and changes meds is difficult and painstaking. Stick with it. You know yourself, and you'll know when you find the right meds. I really haven't had any side effects with Lexapro, but I would rather have some smaller issues (weight gain, IBS, etc.) than feel so upset all the time. "

However, immediately after my first child was born, I developed a perinatal mood disorder known as OCD.  I struggled for years and refused to take medication.  About 6 months ago, my doctor and I decided on Lexapro.  It has been a game changer for me.  I am a highly functional person and some would consider me an overachiever and workaholic.  But my OCD, anxiety and ADD were interfering significantly with my ability to function, focus and sleep.  A very good friend recommended Lexapro and my doctor agreed.  I am so happy and relieved every day to have this support.  I would recommend this drug to anyone who suffers from anxiety or OCD.  I will say that the first week is a huge adjustment.  I was very tired and had migraines every day.  I also suffer from migraines and the Lexapro has significantly reduced my migraines and headaches.  I highly recommend it.

When Paxil 1st came out after Prozac my Dr told me that my sexual dysfunction was not a side effect because it wasn't in the side effects in the pamphlet. I believe these pharma companies knew from the beginning that I'd never have an orgasm again. I dont believe that testing on a rat or any animal is going to say what this does to me. I was 30 years old when I was put on Paxil&now I'm 58 still no orgasms since Paxil. That means no more orgasms I'm now58& this stuff has caused permanent damage sexually&there is nothing I can do to get it back. What I should've done was get rid of the husband which was causing my depression&low self esteem.I've only known abuse from my parents so I had nothing to gauge an abuser with. My Dr later said I was right about the Paxil.Now it says that it causes sexual side effects.What is your orgasms worth to you? Orgasms lengthen your expectancy. Also whenever I hear about a teen shooting their parents or murdering their dermatologist over an acne medication. Why is it mostly after they go on Zoloft.Phil Hartman's wife who struggled w/addiction said that Zoloft made her feel abnormal.Like she was going to jump out of her skin. The family being wealthy sued the manufacturer of Zoloft & won. What about the rest of us who are permanently damaged by all the SSRI's which have been proven to release your seratonin to fast,your brain can only make so much.Dr Drew&your brain then uses all the spare serotonin like a pasta drainer. I didn't need anything that bad to give up my orgasms. What is that monetarily worth to you? These are terrible drugs&the psyc. DRS know it. I'd never take an SSRI again they never helped in the 1st place&they wear off. Big pharma wont release how many people lost their sex lives orlife after drug pushing drs who will sell you out 4 a free lunch. My pain Dr has a sign saying no reps,he does his own RESEARCH. We should b told about these B4 being prescribed it.

Couldn't sleep prior to taking this medication. Friends and my doctor told me to stay on it. Nausea every morning. Was taking this medication after dinner. Took only 5 mg . Week 2  things started to get better with anxiety. Although I would have to take a low dose zanax every now and then. Still had the nausea and sleeping insomnia, but sleeping started to improve. Started to develop more stomach issues . More frequent heartburn. Acid reflux seemed to get worse. Sex drive was ok but erections were harder to achieve . Overall the drug seems to work after a month . It definitely does the job. But the side effects some times for me are not tolerable. I don t get excited about doing things as much. Motivation is less . And I'm tired when I get up in the morning. Still wake up once or twice a night. But I'm sleeping better. Before taking this drug , like I said, I wasn't sleeping at all. And I was taking a few sleeping pills . Now I just take a half of a 5 mg melatonin . And a half of a 0,25 mg zanax . And sleep decent. If you can get through the nausea and headaches  you should be fine. Takes a good two weeks. Drinking alcohol with this med is not recommended at all. If you do , like I did after a couple glasses of wine . Headaches and hangover . Not a good feeling, throws you off for a day or two. Hope all this helps. Still having heartburn after a month

I made the mistake of taking this in the morning and it just made me feel worse the first day so I switched to 7 in the evening to counter the wakefulness. I noticed a difference within hours of taking the medication, I no longer had a heightened sense of sensitivity to the noise around me at work (call center). Although it has worked wonders for the anxiety I HATE that I am completely UNINTERESTED in sex. Like none at all. Zip Zero Zilch. There are many things I can put up with but that is not really one of them. I'm in the process of transitioning to welbutrin. I am hoping that it will still have the same affect without the side effect. I haven't had the weight gain that most people talk about. For about a week I did get really depressed. I really wish I could live with the side effect. I'm actually wanting to meet new people and grow my network of count on one hand friends. I'm reading up on the welbutrin to see if I will actually make the switch. So far I'm not sure if I want to risk the seizures that can happen with being on that medication.

It was horrible. The first night, I took the drug and went to sleep. About an hour later, I woke up and threw up violently then proceeded to have wave after wave of panic attacks for the next 5-6 hours. The next night, I took the drug and told myself that the first night was probably just my body adjusting to the new medication and that I would be fine and it wouldn't happen again. But it happened again. And again. And again. I had constant panic attacks for about 2 weeks before I just stopped taking the drug. I couldn't handle it. I wasn't sleeping at all. And my doctor had the nerve to tell me that I caused the panic attacks - but I wasn't causing them - I'm well versed in panic attacks and I know when I'm causing them and when they just happen. I don't recommend just stopping the drug like I did because that could REALLY MESS YOU UP but I made sure I was watched for a couple days after I stopped taking it in case something happened. The antidepressant part actually did work - I felt a lot better and that ""heavy cloud"" feeling was gone but I just couldn't handle the panic attacks so I decided to deal with the depression on my own and it took longer than I wanted but it's gone now and I didn't ever go back on a drug to do it.

The first time was something of a disaster.  I was on a full 10mg, and the sexual side effects were terrible.  It also made me feel like a zombie.  My doctor cut the dosage in half.  This time, this is the only reflief I've had from my depression on a medication.  The side effects are much less though it's exacerbated my insomnia.

I'd say for people with really, really bad major depressive disorder (i.e. thoughts of suicide) this would certainly be better than nothing.  But if you're having any of the other symptoms of depression, you might want to talk to your doctor about something with fewer side effects and something more effective.  I function maybe 20% better during the day, but I keep wondering if it's worth it."

I have been taking it at night from day 2 and it sure has helped take the edge off.  I cut out all caffeine also which definitely has helped too.  I am back driving again and can ride in elevators and be in crowds and not be bothered or panicked.  It has given me my life back!!!

I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Dysthymia causing stress induced hallucinations and panic attacks sometimes severe enough to cause suicidal thoughts. The drug started working slowly after the first week and took full effect about a 1.5 months of use. I was very tired on and off for the first 3 weeks of use. Now small things make me happy, I rarely have panic attacks and no hallucinations. I feel normal for the first time in my life. WARNING! When your doctor says to not quit cold turkey they MEAN IT. I went off my meds for a week after 3 months of use and after 3 days without had even worse severe sudden and suicidal panic attacks frequently. DO NOT SUDDENLY QUIT THIS ONCE ON IT. make sure your doctor gives you access to months of this drug as a precaution so you never run out all of a sudden. I have a 5 month at a time prescription now.

I was able to start doing things I hadn't done in years...standing in line in busy stores, concerts, etc.  I stayed on for a year.  During the last few months, I started having side-effects.  God-Awful sweats and wait gain.  Coming off of it was a process too.  If I hadn't had the side effects, I may have stayed on.

This med has given me my life back better than new and my husband has his wife back and my daughter her mom. I am now focused, busy and social again. Greatful and thankful to God for taking my worrys and bringing me Lexapro. Without God I wouldn't be here right now. Try Lexapro, but also give your worries to God. He can handle them.

Slight worry turned into full-blown panic attacks and daylong anxiety.  I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep (literally), couldn’t think about much else besides my health and why no one could figure out what was wrong with me.  With anxiety comes a bunch of physical symptoms and I was certain each one of those symptoms was more proof of me having some sort of undiscovered health condition, feeding into the anxiety.  After trying some relaxation techniques, exercising, reading a book about it, etc, I came to the tough decision that I was too far-gone and actually needed some medical help.  This was worst case scenario for me as I did not want to have to go on any medication.  I had never been on any in my life and didn’t want to start.  My Doctor prescribed me 5mg of Lexapro for 6 months.  Long story short, Lexapro saved my life.  It’s as simple as that.  The side effects I experienced the first 10-14 days were absolutely horrible: I basically experienced every reported side effect for at least a few days, and each day a new side effect would rear its ugly head.    I emailed my Doctor telling him I was going to give up as I was in too much misery with the side effects and my anxiety had gotten even worse.  He suggested I just give it another week and to my surprise, each side effect gradually started going away after a few days.   6 weeks into my first Lexapro tablet and I was completely back to normal.  Like the entire miserable 3 month anxiety episode I had just gone through was just a dream.  Had I bailed after 5-6 miserable days and not stuck with it, I don’t know what would have happened to me.  I finished my Doctor prescribed course of 6 months and its like the entire thing never happened. I'm back to myself 100% because of Lexapro.

Anxiety has lessened severely, panic attacks have been shut off completely. I'll get the odd strange feeling that I might be having one, again, but am able to subside it and distract myself. I'd go on trips with my friends and be a little more quiet than I normally am, but I'd honestly take that over feeling the way I did before.  Side effects have been sluggishness, lots of yawning & feeling like I just want to dive into bed and get the day over with... A bit of confusion & memory impairment at times when I wake up in the morning.  People need to understand you can't just take this and completely rely on it to fix you - You've got to get off your ass & introduce more fitness and healthy lifestyle to pair with it to achieve the best results.  I'm on a very low dose (5mg) as I don't enjoy taking pharmaceuticals. Hope to nip this in the bud and be able to understand how to cope with Anxiety & Panic attacks without the use of drugs! Feeling great now, though! No terrible side effects that some people seem to complain about!

I was me again, however briefly. Unfortunately, that didn't last long. Around the eight month mark, I started to feel completely numb. I had always relied on my anxiety to keep me in check, but the Lexapro had numbed that out too. I never left bed, failed classes during college, and let apathy take over. I didn't care about anything: eating, my grades, my friends, my family, showering, or taking care of myself. I got out of bed maybe once or twice a day to take care of my cat and that was it. I got off of it about two months ago and I feel like me again, but still riddled with anxiety and depression. Lexapro, you were my miracle drug for a few months, but I couldn't be apathetic forever.

I cried all of the time, had crazy mood swings and was just never happy.  Since taking Lexapro, all of that has gone away and I'm much more well balanced and happy.  The side effects I've experienced are weight gain (30# in 3 yrs), no sex drive, fatigue, yawning, and increased sweating.  While I would much prefer not have the side effects, I feel they're a fair trade for restoring my sanity and my life!
138$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$7/10/2015 12:23:29 PM$Reviewer: Redalgo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"Increase in dosage was initially needed but the only adverse effects I encountered were from forgetting to take it for up to three days. Used beside cognitive therapy for the first year, it is effective except for when experiencing major life changes or having a particularly bad day owing to an abnormally severe collection of stressors. When mired in a low or very anxious, recovery time is measured in hours instead of days or weeks like it used to be prior to treatment.

For context, I developed depression and social anxiety issues somewhat over a decade prior to seeking treatment. With the combination of escitalopram and cognitive therapy the amount of progress made in the management of these problems has, frankly, been surprising, exceeding my expectations."

The attacks came primarily while driving but when one hit me at home at 4 a.m. I checked myself into the ER. I had gone off Lexapro a year earlier after being on it for two years, prompted back then by another bad set of panic attacks. I'm back on Lexapro and feeling much better. Mindfulness meditation and acupuncture and regular exercise have also been key. But Lexapro has given me the space I need to accomplish those other activities.

148$Condition: Depression$5/9/2015 5:02:45 AM$Reviewer: JP, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've always had intense anxiety and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anorexia, EDNOS, anxiety disorder. 

A year ago, after a 20-year battle, I admitted myself into residential treatment for an eating disorder. The eating disorderwas my coping mechanism to self medicate, in a sense: starvation made my highs less intense and gave me purpose during my depressive lows.

Without my usual coping mechanisms, the depression didn’t lift. After two months wondering what the point of it all was, in nearly unbearable physical and mental pain, with NOTHING I could think of that would make me happy, I realized I needed help.

So I saw a psychiatrist who put me on 5 mg of Lexapro.

The very first day, I felt it. I know that’s rare, but I’m super sensitive. I entertained the possibility of it being a placebo effect, but I know it’s not. How?

Well, I’ve been a nervous sweater my whole life. I drench my clothes in tense situations, in freezing cold, in heat. The first day on Lexapro, the sweating went from excessive to normal. This is not something you can change with a placebo effect. 

The pain in my chest started to ease, I noticed colors and sounds and smells in a pleasant way rather than not noticing them at all, or being totally overwhelmed by them.

I could face the everyday tasks that had felt impossible before. I started feeling for the first time in my life, “This must be a bit what it feels like to be a normal person.”

It’s been two and a half weeks. I had a few side effects initially: dry mouth, clenching jaw, foggy head, loss of appetite, hot puffy hands and feet, and a surge of foggy exhaustion for about two hours after taking my morning 5 mg pill.

It subsided within a week. It’s completely even now.

I have a full range of emotions. I don’t feel the meds now. I just feel like I can breathe a little better. I have a little more strength to face the every day things. I even feel joy again now and then. "

It definitely controls my  depression/anxiety disorder. Two side effects are problematic: weight gain and trouble achieving orgasm. I have found the benefits outweigh the side effects. I wish a 15-mg. tablet was available. A 10-mg dose leaves me vulnerable to depression symptoms, while a 20-mg dose is too sedating. I take about 15 mg. per day by splitting a 20-mg. tablet into a 1/2 piece and a 1/4 piece. That dosage works well.

I thought that it might make me zombie-like and not able to experience emotion but it did not do that at all.  The only negative side effect that I have noticed is difficulty waking up to my alarm in the morning (late to work everyday now because I can't get up) and drowsy while at work.  I am a 44 yo female and take 10mg at bedtime.  I read that I might be able to take 5mg in the morning and 5mg with dinner and that might help with the drowsiness.  Other than that this medication has helped to ease the deep depression that I've been feeling and I am back to  smiling and feelings of general happiness.

As all antidepressants, nothing kicked in for a couple of weeks. By August, there was a week that I had an extreme manic episode. I basically acted how you would assume somebody on methamphetamine was on. The medication actually made me more paranoid, and I ended up overdosing on my medication (the first suicide attempt of two in the past six months). My doctor did not want me on an antidepressant, for I acted the same way on the last one. Be wary and don't be afraid of asking questions, especially if you've had episodes of hypo/mainia. Even if you are young(er), as me (14). If there is any history of Bipolar Disorder (even if it is only supposed), be wary as possible. I would've never expected a mental health disorder, especially one as dangerous as Bipolar Disorder. Make sure you are closely monitored, even if you act ""happy as can be"". If it's excessive, call your doctor; IMMDEIATLY. "

I'm talking euphoric/orgasmic almost.  Greatest f'ing yawns in the history of yawns, y'all can't even imagine.  They wore off after like 4 months though.  The medicine didn't really work for me, other than by giving me side-effects.  My head was always cloudy, I was unable to focus on my thoughts, and my jaw always was tense.  I had twitching and headaches, nervousness, restlessness, and all of those other ness's as well.  Thanks for prescribing this to me, my dear waste of a psychologist!  Don't even get me started on the uselessness of this type of profession.  The only revelation that was concluded from our sessions was that it was a waste of my time and money.  I could've gotten more insight from talking to my cat.  

Because of the horrible experience with Lexapro, I opted out of taking anymore Anti-D's for 3 miserable years due to fear of having to go through all of the side-effects again and coming to find out that it didn't work.  Three years is a long time to continuously contemplate the many different ways you could just end it all.  Anyways, I am now on Effexor, and I can no longer feel the emotion of sadness whatsoever.

I started taking it for depression and GAD, and about a month after I got up to 20mg/day, it finally kicked in and I feel amazing. I no longer feel utterly hopeless and useless; I don't dwell constantly on negatives or worry incessantly about everything (in fact, I can't even -force- myself to ruminate, which is a weird feeling); I'm actually cheerful 90% of the time and hardly ever have down days anymore; and I feel a lot more confident and outgoing and actually comfortable around people. Overall, lexapro has made me so much more positive and relaxed and, well, ""normal"". I can finally just get on with things and enjoy life instead of moping around and worrying. And I don't feel like it has blunted my emotions at all either, which is something I heard a lot about beforehand. Plus, apart from some heavy tiredness and constant yawning during the first couple of weeks. I haven't had any side effects (no weight gain, thankfully!), so that's a huge plus.

Starting Lexapro was tough.  Shivering with stomach cramps, for a week I constantly felt like I had taken some bad, terribly impure Ecstasy.  The nurse told me that this was normal.

Once I became acclimated to the drug, my anxiety disappeared.  That was such a relief!  However, I was incredibly fatigued during the day.  I felt like I was functioning at a bare minimum, day to day.

I also stopped caring about most things in general.  My house wasn't as clean and creative endeavors came to a halt.  My short term memory declined.  I was necessarily unhappy about any of this; I just felt dull.  It felt like my brain was muffled.

I experienced lucid, unnerving dreams/nightmares most nights while taking Lexapro.  My mind went to really dark places, leaving me both frightened and exhausted.  I often woke up in the morning with my upper back muscles frozen in tension, feeling as if I had not slept at all.

I am fairly thin to begin with, but I gained 8 pounds in the eight months I took it, all in my middle.  It took a long time to get this off afterward.

Getting off Lexapro was also tough, with back pain, insomnia, and 10 days of ""brain zaps"".

This was an effective med for me in terms of curbing the acute anxiety I was experiencing at the time, but the side effects were too difficult for me to manage over the long term."

I finally approached my physician and described my episodes to him.  He asked about depression but I felt that I did not have any symptoms.  He prescribed Lexapro 10mg, once daily.  He also gave me a small amount of Xanax 0.5mg for as needed use only.

The first day I had minor side effects, mostly a mild headache.  The second day the side effects became worse with nausea and headaches and increased anxiety.  It was bad enough I decreased my dose to 5mg the next two days.  On the 5th day, and every day since I have been taking 10mg once daily.  The side effects are nearly completely gone after just one week on the medication!!

I had almost immediate results from this medication.  I never felt I was depressed but I can tell you that my mood is greatly improved and I feel much better.  I have not noticed the anxiety levels I once experienced.  Lexapro has helped me immensely.

I'm writing this because I read so many reviews that indicated it took weeks or months for this drug to work for them.  I may be different, but it worked for me almost from day one!  I am very pleased."

Don't take any notice of people saying it 'works' for them - you're reading something written by someone who's severely altered by a drug. You'll find almost nobody who's taken this drug and gone off it, who thinks it was great.

My brain feels numb to pleasure.  I feel zoned out all the time.  I can no longer get an alcohol buzz.

I had tried some other medications and they made me quite sick. I started this medication at a very low dose and experienced nausea, lethargy and dizziness. My doctor told me this was a good sign that the medication was working. I then started to lose control over my thinking and could not focus. My doctor told me this was a symptom of depression and to up the dose of the medication. The nausea never went away and the doctor told me the nausea was anxiety and to up the dose of the medication. I was so sick and tired I was unable to be active or engaged. The doctor told me this was major depressive disorder and to consider taking another medication and to up the dose of the Lexapro. I refused the second medication but did up the dose of the Lexapro. I was so sick I could barely get out of bed. Finally, I told my doctor I was going off the Lexapro. He worked out how to safely lower my dose and warned me that I may have flu like symptoms and that if I did I was to slow the lowering. I did not have flu like symptoms, but I felt more desperately depressed and out of control than I had in a long long time. Extreme dizziness, nausea and hysterical crying lasted about a week through the tapering of the medication. Finally off the medication, I no longer feel sick. While I do continue to have symptoms of depression and PTSD, they are nothing compared to sickness I felt on this medication. The Lexapro and response to my symptoms by my doctor robbed me of 6 months of my life. The traumatic event that the doctor kept prescribing me drugs for was never as horrible as being on this medication. While it clearly does work for many people, it does not work for all. If you feel like you may benefit from this medication and want to give it a try, I would not discourage that; however, if it does not work, listen to yourself and trust yourself.

One was I felt like there was a wall up when I wanted to feel an emotion.  Kind of like, it would have appropriate to cry or feel sad, but I just felt numb.  The second was the price skyrocketed to where I was paying about $1200 a year for my prescription.  The first month was difficult as I had the ""lightning headaches"" I had heard about and some dizziness, difficulty sleeping, and stomach upset.  I am happy to say after 6 weeks, I feel great.

Sweating a lot at night. Increased the pitch of tinnitus I already had in my ear. Restless sleep the whole time on this. Could never fall into a deep sleep. Increased appetite; gained about 20 pounds. Made anxiety worse for the first few weeks before making it better.  Immediate relief of muscle tension. Improved mood immediately. Took for about 2-3 months. Stopped because I started getting an overall sick feeling from taking the medication long term.  My body just felt like it made me feel bad. Not lexapros fault, I get that feeling when I take an antibiotic long term too, so I recognized the feeling. Noticed nerve sensations in lower lip after long term use  and when I quit taking the medicine that sensation went away. Had no problem with slowly decreasing dosage and tapering off.  Definitely worth a try to see if it works for you.  Would consider taking again.  Took name brand, not generic.

I haven't had anxiety, I can deal with situations better and I feel like I have my life back. Side effect unable to reach climax. Sexual side effects are the worst but I am willing to deal with it if it means no anxiety.

I also gained weight, 100 pounds. I finally put it all together and started tapering, it took 14 months to taper off of 30mg of Lexapro. The month after I started to have normal periods and I have lost 90 pounds total in the first year that I was off lexapro. Don't lose hope you will lose the weight after you safely taper off of lexapro. Before lexapro I was on Zoloft which wore off. Anyhow since being off all SSRIs I have had no panic attacks or harmful anxiety. I think that having to deal with withdrawal, it made me deal with my stress and any anxiety easily.

I guess to go with withdrawal for me was way worse than any panic attack or anxiety attack I ever had. this June I will be two years SSRI free and no panic or anxiety since off the pills. This from over 15 years of SSRI use in total."

Same drug essentially. I also take 200mg of Lamictal - now THAT was the lifesaver. Before that, in the same day, I would swing between elated, uncontrollably social anxiety, extreme rage, irritability and paranoia and then finally the sobbing hopelessness, worthlessness, just kill me hoorah. We added Celexa to up my ""happiness"" because I still felt fairly depressed at times and switched to Lexapro for the same reason. Anyway, for the past 6 or so months my sex drive has been reduced to zero. I used to love sex! I love my boyfriend to death but I don't even want to have sex with him. And I barely do it myself anymore when I used to do it like 1 to 5 times a day! I have finally realized this is because of the Lexapro and I'm going to gradually stop taking it. Sex is a big part of being human and a part I really enjoy! Technically, it's our number one drive (to continue the species), biologically speaking. I am an alcoholic and started the Celexa when I was drinking. Now I've been sober a year and I'm sticking with the Lamictal but gonna give life a shot without the Lexapro and with a sex drive. It also kind of wires me right when take it, at other times I could fall asleep where I sit/stand and can definitely up my irritability, short fuse, and anxiety. Not worth it. And trust me, I don't have a mild case of Bipolar. But it's worth it to me to see what life is like sober, without all these crappy side effects. Oh, I'm also often totally indifferent to the world. I do not like that either. Good luck!"

Current side effects: Dry mouth, loss of appetite, restlessness, drowsiness, easily annoyed(but not as bad as before), altered interest in intercourse, and problems with ejaculation :( .  It seems like a lot, but the fact that it chills me out so much and I don't blow up on anyone anymore outweighs the side effects, well, maybe not the sexual ones(my poor wife she's been working extra hard...LOL).  So point is, is you have to weigh it for yourself and speak to your doctor when you do have side effects to ensure it's something not serious. Also, I'm on Adderall for ADHD, which also has similar side effects, with increased erections...ugh!

When generic Lexapro came out, but wife didn't tell me, but started me on generic lexapro.  Within 2 weeks, I wasn't feeling right, anxiety returned and wife could see it wasn't working at all.  She immediately called the pharmacy and doctor. By having my doctor say I needed the real Lexapro prescribed, life became good again. Yes, it is expensive now because insurance doesn't fully cover it if there is a generic.  You can appeal insurance decision, but you need to take several other lexapro family drugs and if they don't work, insurance will cover real lexapro.  I am on 10% dose and haven't experienced negative side effects, yet I still have emotions, but don't get as ugly about nothing. I wish they would pull generic lexapro from being prescribed as it does nothing and only give lexapro bad reviews.

I was taking 80mg each day and for the first time in my life felt good, although somewhat hyperactive. I was forced to switch to something less expensive after several years of it working so well. I was put on celexa and told that the 2 were interchangeable. Celexa hasn't worked as all and i have slipped back into depression and debilitating anxiety which causes me to have constant bouts of vomiting. I tried to go back on Lexapro at 20mg and half an hour after taking the dose i became violently ill. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my stomach in painful knots, my vision was blurry and my extremities cold, i vomited for the rest of the day. This happened twice after, i tried with 10mg and then again with 5mg, each time my symptoms decreasing with the dose, but still affecting me very much. I don't understand how a drug that worked so well for me for so long could make me so sick after not taking it for a matter of only a few months. Has anyone else ever had this sort of reaction?

I have had ongoing symptoms such as diarrhea, excessive sweating, especially on my hands and feet, dizziness, dry mouth and loss of appetite.  The symptoms seem to become worse around my minstrel cycle.  I often feel myself becoming depressed when I am having pre minstrel symptoms(PMS).  My anxiety and panic attacks have almost disappeared completely but some of the side effects from the medicine have made it difficult to function my life the way I need to function in order to get things done.  I am not sure I want to keep on this medicine even if my anxiety comes back after I stop taking it.

It is and has been hell. It has only been a week and I feel horrible physically and mentally. These drugs are so dangerous. If you plan on taking them the rest of your life, then it may not be an issue, at least not yet.

259$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$12/30/2013 7:39:14 PM$Reviewer: Lexa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$5$I was around 30 when I was prescribed Lexapro.  At the time I was a very successful Realtor and was quite stressed with work.  I noticed I was forgetting basic things like what I had for breakfast, did I have breakfast, did I feed the dog? My short term memory was crap and it was starting to affect my life.  I couldn't remember parts of conversations.  People were telling me things that I did or said and I honestly couldn't remember it.  I had to start trusting other people's memories more than mine which I didn't like.  This went on for under 2 yrs then my doctor figured it was anxiety and we gave this a try.  I wasn't on it for very long because even though it 'mellowed me out' and I did feel less stressed from my job it was the worst.  I didn't want to get confrontational with anyone and wanted to avoid people, I only wanted to be around friends/family.  I didn't want to take phone calls or answer emails.  It basically turned me from a tiger to a kitten... which was a problem when people hired the tiger.  It made me sheepish, which might work out for some people but I wouldn't recommended it for any professional that has to deal with confrontation or needs to be assertive for work.  I felt very much not like myself on it.

Constant anxiety, no sleep, mind did not stop running, felt like my body was flying away from me in all different directions.  Got close to a total mental break down.  Was given Lexapro, 10/mg daily, within a week I was sleeping & started to be able to cope again.  No side effects, no weight gain.  After 1st year, needed a refill & was terrified MD would not refill because I felt wonderful on it.  I took it for another year (2 years total).  Mom passed away & hubby in remission.  Felt I needed to try life again without it.  I weaned myself off over a 2 month period skipping days inbetween until my last bottle was gone.  Two months was not long enough for the 'weaning period', I had most of the withdrawal side effects already mentioned off & on for about 6-8 months after.  It wasn't fun, but my only regret is that I did not 'wean' long enough.  If I ever needed it again, it would be my drug of choice.  However, I would do a much longer weaning period & research how to do so correctly. It's a wonderful drug to get you through when life events are too much to handle.

It took about 6 weeks to be effective. I went from excessive compulsive thinking and crying daily to practically no symptoms. I have had almost no side effects. The only side effect was a 10lb weight gain which I am not thrilled about. I am switching to Welbutrin 150mg for this reason. I hear it is difficult to get off of Lexapro, but have cut down to almost nothing over the last week with dizziness being my only symptom. I have struggled my whole life with OCD and anxiety. It became unbearable. Everyone reacts differently to drugs depending on your genetics. I recommend giving Lexapro a chance. It saved me and never at any point while taking Lexapro have I felt ""numb"" or "" not myself"". Best of luck"

Complete lack of sex drive, which is in turn hurting my relationship with my partner. I've been drinking a lot more, just in an effort to feel something. Increased thoughts of self-harm. I don't know, this is the 3rd anti-depressant I've been on in the past 10 years & they've all made me feel ""zombiefied"" so maybe that's just how they react with me.

I finally decided that I wanted to feel what it was like to not be on a drug and a large reason for my decision was that I just wasn't feeling any type of feelings on it.  It was not the hardest thing in the world to get off this drug and in the end I feel so much better and am able to cry again, which is so good for you in my opinion.  I also quit smoking and drinking a year later and now my moods are so steady and normal, like they used to be when I was in my 20s.  I feel young again and happy.  I would have to say quitting smoking was harder than getting off Lexapro, so if you want to get off of this drug..you can do it!  It takes about six months to feel normal again but you must taper off.  I did it on my own that way because my Doctor actually told me I would be better off staying on it since it's difficult to stop taking it..can you believe it?  They are in it for the money...no doubt. Good luck!

The doctor originally prescribed 10 mg but the dry mouth symptom became so bad that I reduced the dosage to 5 mg.  Lexipro helped with the anxiety and anger episodes, but at times, I felt manic. After taking the drug 6 months, the dry mouth, weight gain of mostly belly fat of 20 lbs, tiredness, absolutely no libido and no orgasms, and trouble sleeping has forced me to stop the medicine as of a week ago.  I am feeling on edge now as a result of stopping the drug, but I am hoping the withdrawal symptoms will subside and I will eventually start dropping some of the weight. I am going to try dealing with the anxiety using natural methods including diet and more exercise when my overtime work hours finally slow down.

Lexapro has significantly improved my depression including the obsessive thoughts I was having.  The only side effect I have had is increased hunger and subsequent weight gain once I increased the dose from 5 mg to 10 mg.
294$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/7/2013 10:36:05 PM$Reviewer: J, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$3$"I started taking Lexapro after having repeated severe panic attacks and developed panic and anxiety disorder 2 years ago. 

Lexapro was VERY difficult to take for the first 2 months as it increased my panic attacks and anxiety levels drastically. I held out, though, and eventually, the initial symptoms faded and my anxiety and panic attacks were roughly 20% of what they were before I was taking Lexapro. So it did work. Mostly. 

After a year, I decided to drop from 10 mg/day to 5 mg/day and this was the most difficult part of being on the drug, hands down. I experienced severe dizziness, migraines, confusion, brain ""zaps"", exhaustion, repeated panic attacks(worse than before I was even taking Lexapro), insomnia, nausea, vomiting, and constant anxiety. Again, though, I held out, and it took about 8 weeks, but I leveled out and finally felt normal again. 

6 months later, I chose to drop from my 5 mg/day dosage to nothing, under my doctor's supervision. I was expecting the severe withdrawal symptoms again but have been very surprised that the symptoms this time have been minimal. Dizziness, brain ""zaps"", and some confusion the first week, but after that, not much else. 

I've been completely off of Lexapro for 4 weeks now and my anxiety has crept up somewhat...I'm at about 50% of the anxiety I was at 2 yrs ago. But I've also been in psychotherapy for 2 yrs and am continuing with therapy, as I know that Lexapro was more of a coping mechanism than anything. It won't fix you, but it will make life easier while you work on fixing yourself. 

I'm not sure I would have made it through the last 2 yrs of therapy without Lexapro and I'm grateful for that. But I would not recommend staying on the drug if you're at a point where you are able to wean yourself off. The withdrawal symptoms can be very intense and I would imagine that the longer you are on the drug, the more intense they may be."

I had medication resistant major depressive disorder. Had taken 30+ different psych meds, was barely functioning. The FIRST time I took Lexapro, the constant unbearable sadness that plagued me as a young child and all through my teens just disappeared. Gone. It never came back. It was like I was reborn or something. I never knew what it was to feel ""normal"" before taking lexapro. To NOT have that horrible, aching, sadness overwhelming me every minute was an indescribable feeling. I've been on it for almost 11 years. I does cause me to sweat horribly, all over my body, even sitting in the office at my desk. BUT I would rather be sweaty and happy then paralyzed by debilitating and relentless depression."

My daughter and niece are also taking it and have had tremendous improvement.  However, the side effects became intolerable.  First symptom, severe dried, chapped lips.  They are so bad that skin peels off in multiple layers a day and my mouth is now raw and red.  Second, after a few months, my hair started falling out in clumps.  Third, severe insomnia.  I was taking 15 mg once a day.  My daughter takes 7.5 mg and is doing ok but has the severe chapped lips problem also.  My niece is also taking it and is having severe chapped lips also.  They doing really well otherwise and this medication has made a huge improvement in their quality of life.  

I had to go off of the medication about 3 weeks ago and my lips have not improved yet nor has my hair stopped falling out.  It's such a shame because I did feel much better while taking it.

I would suggest you try a low dose of it and add a helper medication like buspar to minimize the extreme side effects at the higher doses."

I have gone on and off Lexapro as a way to combat the OCD flair-ups I would have.  After many years of on and off, I have chosen and will continue to remain, on the medication.  It significantly decreases repeated thoughts, ticks, and the depression associated with OCD.  Yes, the side effects exist.  I have a lower sex drive, much lower, but it is a price my husband and I are willing to pay for my sanity and happiness. Wellbutrin can be added to decrease the sexual side effects, but I am always afraid to mess with a good things.  I do take an additional medication to help with anxiety that is unrelated to the OCD.

Lexapro is a drug, the real one, just like the other depression medications. Just ask yourself, why MDs don’t take these drugs, because they know better. By the suggestion and encouragement of my MD friend I switched to natural remedies, diet, exercise, positive thinking, St. John’s, etc. and even though it was ong and hard road to recovery, it WORKED. I’ve been where you are and was able to turn the corner without drugs, just natural remedies. Good luck to all of you.
315$Condition: Depression$8/21/2013 10:10:58 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$3$"I was given Lexapro when I was 14 years old. I stopped taking it when I was 23. Coming off of this medication was one of the hardest things I ever did, but I am a much better person for it. Most people don't need to be on these types of pills, and some people do. You are strong enough to get off this medication and change the things in your life that are causing you to take it in the first place. I recently spent a month in the ICU of a hospital where I had a sudden perforated gastric ulcer which no doctors could figure out what caused. I never had problems with acid in my stomach or abdominal pain or any other symptom of an ulcer until it perforated and it was the most excruciating pain I have ever felt. After doing research, I found out that the cause of my perforated ulcer was most likely the Lexapro paired with NSAID pain relievers. These medications cause more harm than is worth making you ""happy"". I strongly advise not taking these types of anti-depressants unless it is your absolute last resort. Coming off Lexapro was a horrible experience, with all the withdrawal symptoms but putting those chemicals in my body was not worth it. It will take you a while to feel like a brand new person but in the end it is all worth it."

It's hard to get adjusted to and takes time.  Give yourself time and be patient. It did have some sexual sides effects but when my doctor put me on Wellbutrin it offset that side effect and I was back to having orgasms but I couldnt take the weight gain and tired feeling.

I'm holding out until the month is over but I have a horrible time sleeping which causes me to be exhausted and completely unmotivated during the day.  I literally have no desire to get out of bed.  I tend to sleep for 2-3 hours once I fall asleep, wake up for another 2-3 hours and then sleep so lightly, I feel like I'm still awake until I finally give up because the tossing and turning gets too much.

In addition to a reduced sex drive, I have a difficult time achieving an orgasm... even alone (which, as most ladies know, sometimes it is the only way).

Again, I'll give it the 4th and final week but I'm definitely looking to switch to a different medication.

Lexapro did help my depression but I felt it kind of brought me to a mellow happy medium. I wasn't back to being excited about everything and being full of life, but I could get through the normal day fine and was overall happy. It got my life back on track. I did notice the sexual side effects others have noted and the doctors mentioned. Its hard to kill a 20 year olds sex drive entirely, however I did notice while in a relationship that it would take some extra effort to be ready every night, if there was a day or two in between it was fine. Sex was more enjoyable once off it. I noticed that I lasted basically as long as I wanted to and had a hard time finishing quickly if needed.  This med has its ups and downs but did help somewhat. Currently back to battling depression even worse and trying a different drug."

370$Condition: Panic Disorder$4/18/2013 2:35:50 PM$Reviewer: stayhopeful, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$After dealing with generalized anxiety for most of my life, I suddenly began to have severe panic attacks. In the span of almost 2 years, I became a different person, scared to do anything I used to be able to do, traffic, severe weather, being alone, sleeping, traveling, crowded spaces, elevators, almost anything and everything would trigger a meltdown and a panic attack which in turn, made me start feeling depressed and wanted to avoid pretty much everything but my bed. I even went to the hospital twice and was given Xanax to help as needed. But finally after a beginning therapy recently, I decided to give in and try medication in conjunction with talk therapy, which even that produced heavy anxiety for me. My general dr. gave me Lexapro and I began with 5mg daily. I also decided to stop taking birth control (Loestrin Fe 24) when I began the Lexapro, which I felt like exacerbated my depression and hormone levels. The Lexapro medication side effects included drowsiness and frequent yawning which made me feel like I couldn't breathe producing more anxiety initially. BUT, finally after 2 - 3 weeks I felt like a “normal human” again and suffer from absolutely NO side effects. After 2+ months of taking this medication (I have stayed on 5mg/daily), I am back to my productive and excited self. I have been able to do almost everything again and have not suffered from any panic attacks since I began the medication. I do still have negative thoughts and cognitions of catastrophes happening randomly, but I am able to stop myself and think positive without any physical sensations of panic. I feel wonderful and I am sooo happy to be on this medication!! Don't give up, stay strong and you will and can conquer this!

Lexapro is the best of all the a/ds I've taken.  I've taken many.  I think Lexapro is the purest of the SSRIs. Its been clean and effective.  By clean, I mean the initial side effect was minor: stomach upset for 2 or 3 days.  I think that's a good start compared to the side effects of most a/ds.  I started feeling noticeably better in two weeks.  I'm now completing the first month and I don't think I'm done improving.  This medication allows me to function normally. No more black hole sadness, most anxiety gone, no feelings of baseless guilt, worthlessness, etc.  Little things don't freeze me into inaction. I'm starting to enjoy life again.  I even laugh now and then.  Lexapro has really helped-- but I still have to put my best foot forward each day to cognitively add to the chemical boost of Lexapro. Only concern now:  No ejaculation.  I can still get an erection with the help of an e.d. med. I'm holding out a slim hope that with time my body will adjust and I'll return somewhere close to normal.  For now, though, feeling better is the most important aspect of my life.  So far, so good.

414$Condition: Depression$2/7/2013 10:25:32 PM$Reviewer: Not blue sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I took this medication every night (10-15 mgs) for almost 10 years for prolonged low grade depression. In order to alleviate the lethagy, I was also taking bupropion in the morning (300 mg) in the morning.  This worked very well for me.  I recently decided it was time to try to live without the drugs.  I was struggling with mood swings but they were not long lasting and I thought I would level out.  However, when superstorm Sandy hit and my house was badly damaged, I found that I was in a depression.  When I went back on them, my prescription drug plan filled it with the generic version and this caused severe reflux (heartburn), headaches and was not as effective in lifting the depression.  I had it refilled with the original Lexapro and all my side effects disappeared and I felt much better emotionally.  Since I am no longer working full time, I do not need the bupropion anymore as I do not need to function at that pace anymore.

421$Condition: Depression$1/25/2013 7:58:51 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$Don't buy the line that only people under 25 suffer increased depression from this drug. It made me increasingly depressed to the point that I stayed in bed most of the day.  They then had to gradually decrease my dosage over a month's time to get me off it.  If I tried to reduce the dosage faster, the depression was multiplied.  I asked my pharmacist about it and he said that a lot of other people reported this problem.  Very bad joke to take a drug for depression which makes you 10 times more depressed.

I have tried to go off of this medication, only to find out that i still need it and withdraw is a bitch. Your depression and anxiety will only get worse. Brain Zaps are real. If you are considering stopping lexapro, do it gradually and under strict supervision. With Lexapro, it's difficult to understand how angry and depressed I used to be. I am a different person in a much better place. I have experianced sexual side effects, but never severe or very often.

Now I sweat less, my face flushes less, I can think clearer when under stress and I don't get in fits of rage as I used to w/o it. The down side of this drug is that while it eliminates the worst end of the spectrum of my mood it also takes away the tip top feeling of joy at the extreme other end of the spectrum of my mood. And lastly, when I have attempted to wean myself off of this drug the side effects are so overbearing and uncomfortable that I have just had to accept that I will be taking this drug for as long as I live as the side effects lingered as long as 4 weeks when I tried to get off of it. Brain zaps, disorientation, inability to think clearly, anxiety, irritability, rage, clumsiness & weight gain were all the symptoms I continuously experienced when I stopped taking this drug. But I LOVE it when I am take it. I only take 20mgs once daily.

After being on Zoloft for several years, when my depression and Anxiety spectrum returned we decided to try Lexapro. It just never felt 'right' from day 1. After several months, I noticed the feelings did not improve and I figured I would need to live with it. I tried varying doses, from 5 MG up to 20MG. Nothing worked. Now almost a year since starting, I've made the switch back to a low dose of Zoloft. Within weeks, I again feel 'normal' and I am not plauged by the overall unease I felt on Lexapro. 

More specifically, the negative: increased anxiety, developing agoraphobia, EXTREME laziness and no motivation, obssessive thoughts and headaches, jaw clenching/bruxism caused a bit of damaged to my TMJ, memory became an issue, cost (even the generic.) Withdrawal, even on a taper back over to Zoloft, is difficult. A lot of agitation, anger and headpains/aches that are beyond description.

The positive: hardly any sexual side effects. Upon first taking it one year ago, for a few weeks there was a bit of unexpected euphoria. For me, that was short lived and slowly the negative impacts crept in. 

Being mindfull now, everyone IS different. We all are wired uniquely and our chemistry varies--other conditions may add or detract from how a drug works for you. I know many people who love Lexapro and it has worked well for them (interestingly, the ones I know have all been female! Just coincidence, but interesting). It wasn't for me, though. Which is why I always suggest to keep trying until you find something that works."

It definitely took away the strong feelings of depression and suicide... but also took away feelings of happiness and enjoying everyday activities. Eventually I had to increase dosage to 20mg to stay effective. If I would miss a day, the effects were immediate - irritable, angry, short temper, etc. Always felt tired while on this drug... was changed eventually to Viibryd. No other side effects noted with Lexapro really.

I went from worrying about my teenagers grades to letting her stress out about it instead. I feel relaxed enough to enjoy the moment in these stressful times. I recently started up on it after I had lost 40 pounds without it. I notice that I am slowly eating more and my weight is increasing a little. With the added relaxation I am less pumped up to go exercise. I'm going to take a half dose for awhile (10 mg). Maybe switching to Wellbutrin will help.

It doesn't make me tired at all. I built up a resistance in about 2 months that caused the doctor to increase the dose from 10 to 20 mg daily. 

The first time I took Lexapro I was also depressed. I stopped taking it after 1 month and it was a small dose. It made me less depressed so I would consider it to have worked. 

I have never continued to take it once I started feeling ""normal"" again. 

This time I continued taking it way beyond the point of my ""Normal"". It had a Manic effect on me as best as I can tell. I have never felt like that before. 
I was feeling great! 
I was getting a solid 4 hours of sleep a night and was able to get up in the morning a few hours ahead of schedule. I even felt good about my work and home environment. 
BUT
I starting singing aloud for no reason. I couldn't stop talking to myself. I decided to make up some imaginary friends to entertain myself. I was unable to control my thougths without shutting down or giving it my full concentration. I got angry over nothing. I started thinking about killing myself. I became paranoid and stressed out over my living situation. I came very close to doing something that I really couldn't control. Very scary way to be, not in control of your brain when you really need to be. I took risks that I wouldn't normally take. I went to the doctor and we both agreed to stop taking it right away. 

Before this antidepressiant, I was taking prozac for depression. This works much better for me than Prozac and I didn't see any side effects other than going Manic. I think I should have stopped taking it once I hit my ""Normal"" like I did before."

My body reacted very badly and it got to a stage it could not function and was in fight or flight state ALL the time though I was not  depressed. She put me on 10mg of lexapro for the PTSD, initial side effects were jaw clenching (subsided after maybe 2 months) and yawning excessively.  I did get some headaches and occassional nausea.  I have not gained weight.  Take it morning time. My body has relaxed and I've been calmer then ever I can remember.  Just completed 6 months on it and have decided today to come off it (cold turkey as no more pills and will see what happens). If bad withdrawal will go back to GP for new perscription for same 10 mg dosage.  I have been very fatigued last couple of weeks and I'm not sure this is any way related to the lexapro.

I started taking Lexapro about 6 months ago for anxiety and depression.  It helped for that, but I had a lot of short-term memory problems while using it.  I would forget what I was going to do constantly.  I discovered a lot of other people on-line also had this problem, and many of them had long-term memory problems even after quitting the drug.  I have quit taking it, because it is just not worth losing my memory over.  I have started taking natural supplements called ""True Calm"" which contain GABA, Glycine, Taurine, Inositol, and Valerian.  It works like a charm.  I am so glad I found it.

Anxiety while driving, can't catch my breath, palpitations. My doctor prescribed lexapro 10mg once a day and xanax 0.25 when needed to get through the transition. I have been on Zoloft for several years but have beeen off since 2003. So I knew what to expect as far as starting and possible side effects. I took one dose of Lexapro and had a pretty much sleepless night, hot flashing, anxious. Felt like crap the next day and slept on and off for most of it. Needless to say, since I am not totally debilitated by the anxiety at this point, I decided to not continue with the lexapro and only take the xanax if the heart palpitations get out of control. I think I'll stick to the accupuncture I started, regular excercise and eating healthier and see if that works :)This is just my experience and maybe I didn't give it a fair shot but its hard to deaal with side effects of starting a med when you have a fulltime job and you're the bread and butter of the household.

He became extremely irratable, mean, aggressive and miserable towards everyone.  This drug was like a miracle drug at first within 2 weeks he seemed happy again. One of my big concerns is that 3 times he forgot to get the lexapro at the pharmacy for 1 day and his mood swings were so severe! He was so annoyed, aggrevated, miserable, nasty and mean all 3 times that he missed his dose for  1 night each.  3 nights ago he missed his dose and i actually stayed at a hotel yesterday thats how bad he was.  I cant believe that missing one dose can change his personality, mood and attitude so quickly but it did! Also he still dosnt want to leave the house, still sleeps excessivly but although his personality (when he takes it every day) is so much better along with his general mood he still has alot of symptoms of depression.  We are going to ask the Dr. to wein him off this, I cant be staying at a hotel everytime he forgets or misses 1 dose for 1 day...thats rediculous I dont think any medication should have that kind of severe effect if you miss it just one time.

After trying other medications, even if they helped somewhat it was never enough.
i got on Lexapro 5 mg then 10 mg
it was a rocky start because i got alot of side effects, such as panic attacks / insomnia / anxiety / etc.....
but i used Klonopin during the side effect symptoms and after about a week or two the side effects went away and i loved it, it was almost like a cure, i found myself not bringing my Klonopin bottle with me everywhere i went, i was able to leave my home, and the panic attacks i did get were less frequent and less intense then ever.

if you are able to Tough out the initial scary side effects, i highly recommend you at least give this drug a try.
(the brand name Lexapro, i did NOT try the generic form)

This medication if it is not covered by your health insurance is very expensive for the brand name. The generic is cheaper but i heard alot of reports that people didnt like the generic and went back to brand name."

I'm diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder/depressive type and psychotic depression. I was going to have ECT but decided to give the meds one more chance. Lexapro seems to work the best. However, being male, I'm have severe erectile dysfunction and no libido. The doctor said this was most likely caused by the med. So it simply was a decision I had to make. I'm single and I'm more concerned with my illness and its treatment than being sexually active. My depression if not treated often caused severe delusions that would place me in a dangerous situation. However, after all this time including a commitment to a state hospital for over two years, I was always taught by my treatment providers that depression doesn't have to be treated by a only a drug. Finding a type of therapy such as CBT, DBT, or finding a support group is very beneficial. After years of seeing only my failures and problems my therapist made look back and remember good things and write them down. Self affirmations are nice also, and a little ice cream is good too.

I will write more later, my ratings might change. I have had Generalized panic and anxiety for a long time, off and on. But somethings have happened to our family and financial problems had put me in a tailspin since Nov. Even tho, I have found some relief with Xanax (half tab of low dosage as needed) anxiety was still coming back. Shaking feeling, sick to stomach, aches and pains, headaches, heart beating fast. I did find out I have a gall bladder that is not working,so that was part of stomach problem. Anyway, I started on 5 mg. of generic to work way up to 10, which I will take tonight. I started taking pill in am. First day hour later, dizzy and thumb twitching (it did stop) and felt sick all day. Next couple of days, burst of engery then a let down feeling. Sick to stomach. Went to work, I cut hair, but felt off. Lots of leg and arm, shoulder pain. I walked a couple of days, felt ok. Then Sunday and Monday, sick, sick, stomach, pain in joints. Called Dr. We think I take Crestor for Chelstrol, that might be causing some joint pain that is making me worry and anxious, too. She said to stop Crestor, and pain is less. I took 5 mg. last night, slept ok, then this am, little light headed and sick, sick to stomach barely could eat. I take Zantac for stomach. Went to work, by afternoon, felt better. Some reason, on this pill I am sick in am, but better in pm. Tonight I am going to take the 10 mg. Wish me luck! I switch from Day to night, bc last few days, felt so tired and yawning. If the 10 mg. makes me jittery at first, will switch to am again. I am also trying to do relax techniques, reading postive things, trying to stay busy and rest also. No sleep problems on this pill. Mostly stomach acid and pain is biggest complaint. Also at times feeling more anxious. I am going to try and give this a months try to see if it helps. I do have slight muscle jerk in knees and finger. Just now and then. I pray it helps me

537$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$5/15/2012 7:14:05 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I went on Lexapro for depression and severe anxiety.  Effexor did not help the anxiety symptoms which I have had all my life.  It is a miracle for me to feel normal in the mornings, not anxious for the first three hours after waking, and my depression is great as well.  I literally wanted to kill myself as well as all the other symptoms of depression.

I would suggest giving this the full 6 weeks before deciding.  My symptoms got worse for the first 2-3 weeks and I had to increase the dose from 10mg to 15 to 20 and 20 is working so be willing to increase if necessary, as well as waiting the 6 weeks before making a judgment call.  And don't throw in the towel if symptoms appear worse before better because your brain has a lot of adjusting to do.

I cannot say enough about this.  It has literally saved my life and given me my life and myself back.  I love it so much.  I feel normal, not happier or high or anything, just normal and balanced.  Still feel happy and sad when I should which I'm glad about.  Having the serotonin and norepinephrine (sp?) balanced makes such a difference in my life and I hope it will in yours too.  Don't give up!!  And if this doesn't work for you there are plenty of others that may be the one you need, but this has more than worked for me!"

The drug was prescribed by my family doctor.I started at 10mg once per day for two months and increased to 20 mg per day for the remainder of the time.I stayed on the medication for 6 months and decided to come off of it because of the side effects. The side effects included low sex drive and an increase in appetite (weight gain of about 13 pounds). I did consult my doctor about ending the medication. I had to gradually decrease the dose and then stop all together. The withdrawal from the medication was really bad, I actually felt worse then before I took the medication. The withdrawal lasted about 2 weeks for me. I believe Lexipro worked well for me but the side effects were too much. I did switch to Wellbutrin XL and it seemed to work great and i had no side effects that i could identify. Just a little info for nursing mothers alway use caution while nursing and using medication. I had one doctor tell me Wellbutrin XL was ok and another told me not to use it. I did choose to come off of it altogether just recently. Also, be aware of what your doctor prescribes for you. I had a pharmacy give me the wrong dosage of medication, I did not know it was wrong because i never seen the actual prescription, it was called in for me. Hope this helps someone out there. Just remember medications will effect everyone in differant ways, so what happens to one person may not happen to another:)

I did stop using it for a few months and the withdrawals were not fun.. even when tapering. However the depression came back full force so I went back on the Lex. I did try the generic by Mylan for about a month and although it is effective it is not as strong for sure! I noticed the depression slowly creeping back. Also I've had bad diarhhea and nausea while on the generic. It costs about 10 bucks less than the name brand so in my opinion it's just not worth it. I might as well take Lexapro which helps more without the side effects.

I have also tried Zoloft and Prozac in the past and generally do not take medication between episodes. Lexapro worked quickly and well--I felt improvements within a week and completely recovered after about two months. It's clearly effective. I do have some complaints, however: 1. First and foremost, Lexapro has a nasty withdrawal. I have never had a problem coming off SSRIs in the past but had significant trouble with this one. Tons of ""brain zaps,"" irritability, mood swings, etc. It's a real pain to taper off. Make sure to do it very carefully, slowly, and under supervision. If you taper off too quickly, you could end up depressed all over again. 2. Sexual side effects were the worst of any SSRI I've taken. In my case, much lower libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Most SSRIs have these extremely unfortunate side effects, but this one gave me the most trouble. 3. Dosing is a bit awkward. 10mg didn't work quite well enough for me and 20mg worked but made me feel like a spaced-out zombie. I was too frustrated by the end to try 15, admittedly, but there isn't much room for finding an ideal dosage. 4. Extremely expensive if insurance doesn't cover it. It's set to go generic this year, although I don't have the latest news on this. Every medication works different for everybody, and this was only my experience. I would first and foremost say that if you feel depressed or anxious, make sure you see a therapist and make appropriate lifestyle changes. If you need an antidepressant, I would recommend Prozac--very cheap, works for me at the minimal dose (20mg) and no withdrawal. Maybe this will work for you, but I won't be taking it again."

I have never been depressed in my life but was prescribed primarily an antidepressant.  SSRI’s like Lexapro are like old phone cameras. Yes they can take pictures (treat anxiety), but their primary use is making phone calls (treating depression). Benzodiazepines on the other hand are your true high quality 5, 10, 15 megapixels dedicated digital cameras (only for anxiety).  For nearly 4 years I have taken Lexapro with little to no benefit.  I have gained 25lbs despite being healthy and active and my sex drive has diminished substantially.  About 3 weeks ago I decided to quit Lexapro and my doctor put me on .5mg of Clonazipam 2x per day.  WOW I have regained my sanity and nerves.  It really calms me down in just about 20-35 min and relaxes me for about 8hrs.  Oh yeah the sex is much better already too. I am still working on the extra weight. Bottom line is if your problem is anxiety, take the dedicated medication for it. Benzo’s will work in minutes, not like SSRI’s that work in weeks if at all. This with therapy and counseling should do the trick. Hope this helps and good luck to all!

I was told that this drug should just make me feel better in terms of missing energy. I was provided 10 boxes containing 10 (10)mg tablets by his office along with a prescription for 90 tablets.

Timeline:

1-	Visited Doctor on about 3rd week of February 2011 and began prescription of one 10mg tablet of Lexapro a day.
2-	Consumed the initial office provided tablets by which a prescription was filled for 90 tablets on May 26 2011
3-	59 tablets were consumed and prescription stopped (cold turkey) on or around July 24 2011
4-	 Unbeknown to us  due to the absence of any discussion, pamphlet, ect. I was launched into state of mania shortly after discontinuing Lexapro medication.
5-	On August 3rd I submitted my resignation to my employer after 21 year 6 months of service with a fictitious place of employment going forward as I was in a manic state.
6-	During the remainder of time I acted in words only (email) in a very hostile manner to many layers of upper management essentially black balling myself.
7-	Over the month of August I found myself reacting in a hostile manner with three individuals in public with no reason and only due to the manic state I incurred from Lexapro. None of these encounters turned physical.
8-	I entered into a sales agreement for 150k to acquire a new boat. Grandiose spending.
9-	After the surrender of my Company provided car on August 29th I proceeded to purchase a new BMW lease car (500.00 per month) without an income. Grandiose spending.
10-	This manic state persisted until end of October where a very deep depression ensued.


In trying to recollect this occurrence I have found the FDA issued materials in regard to consuming Lexapro. None of the items within this material were at any  point ever outlined of discussed with me. None of the screening questions for this medication were ever discus"

For me, it also numbed my other emmotions (including happiness and sexual response). When I had children the joy was lessened by about 50%. I could have felt more happy for myself but I was too numb (10mg per day).  At the same time, the trade off can be worth it for some people (20mg per day and the anxiety was blessedly gone).  Effectiveness was quick (within one or two weeks), however has decreased over time but is still effective (probably 60-70% as effective at 7 years compared to first few months).  Lexapro also helps with the times I am angry or impatient toward my children and husband.

Having developed MS in my mid 40's,this drug has helped me survive all the new situations and pain I have to live with now I am in my early 50's.

I am at 40 mg a day, the highest possible dose, and I'm just here to warn you all, the effects WEAR OFF. I was put on this antidepressant at age 11, due to my issue of dwelling on every little thing I heard (i.e. scary story told at summer camp) and a tendency to repeat phrases in my head. However, I was only 11 years old, and I have been dependent on the drug since. I got off of it for a year and was put back on it after trying several other antidepressants. This drug has helped my personality and thoughts remain stable and it is a nightmare when I forget to take it because I become very irritable and angry with everything, two symptoms I did not suffer from before taking this med. It has been a blessing but I know I would've been better off never taking it in the first place. I have mixed feelings for it because now it is my sanity pill. I am writing this as a warning to worried mothers looking to ""help"" their children, do not resort to prescription drugs. It has set me up for a life of dependency and seems to have caused more problems than not, as I am taking it for more reasons than I started with. If your child is suffering from weird thoughts or depression take him to a therapist, as putting him/her on meds may help temporarily but will undoubtedly interfere with their quality of life and the ability to live a fulfilled one without depending on a drug/drugs. Please take my advice. The only benefits I notice from this drug are when I haven't taken it for awhile and then resume to take it, because it helps with the side effects of withdrawal, i.e. anger, mood swings, etc."

If you've dealt with PPD (post pardum depression), you know what it does to you after having a baby. It's not a great feeling. Lexapro worked greated! I'm not sure if I will ever get off Lexapro.

Although it supposedly takes time to build in your system, I felt that I was more relaxed almost immediately.  I had been experiencing fighT or flight nightmares that stopped once I started lexapro and it helped me cope with annoying, anxiety-provoking coworkers.   My insurance company suggested I try a different ssri that caused me to have an angry emotional outburst so I immediately switched back with doctor's paperwork required.  We have to pay more and my insurance makes me get 20 mg pills that I have to cut in half, but all this and it is so worth it!

618$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/13/2012 11:50:01 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$5$"I took Lexapro for my anxiety disorder Feb. 2008-July 2010. The only noticable side effect was fatigue which was mitigated by taking it after dinner. Otherwise the anxiety became manageable.

Over time I noticed that my attention suffered, it became harder to feel emotions, and my sex drive was definitely lowered. All of this was a willing tradeoff to anxiety.

Keep in mind, this drug does not cure anxiety. Like it or not, it's something we will always live with. I used my time on Lexapro to learn coping mechanisms and better stress management. 

I decided myself to stop taking Lexapro summer 2010. If a doctor told you this medication is not habit forming (like mine did) then they weren't entirely honest. If I tried to quit cold-turkey I had moderate withdrawal symptoms. I had to gradually lower the dosage over two months, but even then I would have mild dizzy spells and developed a strange nervous tick for a month. 

After the withdrawal period I was fine. I then moved 1000 miles, started graduate school, and entered into one of the most stressful years of my life. The coping mechanisms work like a charm and I haven't had major anxiety issues since. However, the attention problems remain, though it's another thing I just learned to live with."

My doctor increased the dosage; it's been a week now, and the side effects are descreasing. I feel better about life; I'm laughing again and friends are noticing the difference in me. My advice for those experiencing side effects is to give the drug a chance. I hate what I call the ""psychotropic nightmare"" of changing anti-depressants, but it's unavoidable when you have acute, incurable depression. When it's time to change meds you just have to bear with it and give the med a chance to take effect completely, make any changes as needed, and stick with it. Good luck to you all. Depression is an ugly and frustrating disease to work with, but persevere and you will win. A good psychologist is a good idea as well. When you find a good one - talk! Get it out, get over it and go on with living your life as you never have before!"

This would include having hot flashes, blushing.. and headaches. The first two weeks of taking lexapro I was nauseated, dizzy, couldnt sleep and no appetite. I was constantly yawning.. it does something to that area of your brain.. I wasnt tired.. but still couldnt stop yawning all the time. The medication worked well for turning off the voices and the over analyzing I was doing. I decided to go off the med in December deciding it wasnt worth being on when I go to have a baby. I had a horrible experience: really nauseas, headaches.. really bad anxiety.. irritable. . then I ended up having a cronic migraine and went to the ER not beging able to talk or see. SCARY! If you plan on going off lexapro before any big event in your life.. i.e pregnancy.. give yourself a lot of time to wean off.. its AWFUL! I was at my wits end with the way I was feeling.. and contimplated going back on just to make it stop.. Im so glad I'm not off the drug and feeling back to normal.. anxiety free!  If you plan on taking this medication for a long period of time thats fine...but for the short-term.. think twice.. I would suggest seeking therapy instead!

I felt that I was able to let go of the negative voice in my head that was making me have feelings of unnecessary guilt, worry and sadness.  I smile more and am able to relax and not feel so irritable all the time.  I have had Hashimoto's thyroiditis for 5 years and have noticed that having this hypothyroid condition has made my moods more unstable.  I am so happy that I started Lexapro.  I haven't gained any weight or had any side effects on this medicine (besides nausea and feeling of fullness in ears in the first week. My whole outlook on life is positive now and I plan on staying on this medicine for at least a year.

It did work for treating my depression. I often wonder if I didn't go to the doctor when I did if I would even be alive today.  Geez, looking back it was that bad. 

It took me 2 attempts to quit taking the lexapro both within a 6 month period. The withdrawals were unpleasant. 

Today- 4-5 months later, my depression has left me, I sorted out my personal problems in my head and feel stable. Unfortunately, almost tooo stable minded, as if nothing even phases me anymore. Somewhat emotionless  lately. 

Also, I am experiencing sexual issues as well. Difficulty maintaining ejaculating during sex and difficulty sharing emotions with partners. This was one of the side effects that brought me to quit taking Lexapro, yet I still am experiencing the same side effects. Without a doubt it makes my relationships strange. 

Conclusion, I do believe lexapro treated my depression, but now I have side effects that are good reason to be depressed yet I feel nothing. Ha...how bout that!?

I'm not as angry when I take them. And it's been about 6 yrs or so now. But going threw withdrawls while you're pregnate has been a nightmare. I'm 35 and wasn't planning on getting pregnate. The hormone impalance and withdrawl from lexapro. OMG!! Working full time and having severe rushes from the lexapro withdrawl. I still get rushes and it's been two weeks since I took my last dose.

655$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/28/2011 2:46:02 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$2$5$I loved the way Lexapro made me feel. I felt like I had complete control of my emotions, and a far more extensive range than other antidepressants had allowed me, e.g. Zoloft and Paxil. However, I am five foot three and always weighed under one hundred and five pounds, and have been very active and proud of my toned stature. In the first year I started lexapro, went from less than one hundred and ten pounds to just under one hundred and sixty. Not only was the sudden, SIXTY POUND, weight gain  enormous (despite my seven day a week intensive martial arts exercise and healthy eating) a shock), but it  happened over six months, which caused serious pressure on my muscles, skin, and general energy level. I was an extremely fit, athletic person who suddenly lost all physical confidence despite feeling emotionally great. I switched to Wellbutrin XL three months ago and have already lost over thirty pounds without any exercise, so I am in no doubt that this horrible medicine ruined my confidence, relationship, and sex life. Lexapro made exercise and diet useless, and the mere switch, even eating whatever I wanted and exercising a minimal level, led to an extreme change.

Not long after taking it, my depression got worse. I turned to being suicidal. It also changed my sex drive to non existent. I was in my early 20's and I knew this wasn't normal. After the last and final time of attempting suicide, I finally talked to my doctor about it and she quickly took me off the lexapro. Since then, I have done better. I have personally decided to deal with my disorders without medication, which has been rough but lexapro has scared me into this decision. My 13 year old suffers from manic depression and ADHD. They are also considering that he may be bipolar. His doctor is switching him from zoloft and vyvance to lexapro and adderall. I am now afraid that this medicine will have the same affect on my child as it did me. The fact that he already has suicidal thoughts prier to lexapro make it worse. If any of you have a child like mine, I'd really love your feedback on these medications. my email is [email protected]

After stoping the lithium, due to it causing kidney insufficiency, I stopped everything for a few weeks.  Upon starting the lexapro again, after only one week I felt wonderful.  Optimistic, energetic, sleeping well,it is such a strange combination of good feelings for me because I've been bipolar with anxiety disorder and OCD for most of my 55 years of my life.  I pray this isn't just a coincidence, that it is a true and accurate depiction of what my life can be like now.  My two adult sons deserve a better  mother than I have been for all of their lives.  My husband deserves a sane wife and partner that he doesn't have to tiptoe around on egg shells wondering what is going to ""set me off"" the next time.  Will holidays with relatives turn into nightmares from bipolar world.  I sincerely hope and pray that the kidney disease that the lithium and hypertension caused will not change for the worse to keep me from being unable to take my lexapro.  It seems like finally, at 55 years of age I have a chance to actually be happy, and my wonderful family be able to enjoy being around.

I found that the Lexapro helped me to cope, HOWEVER, the Lexapro SIGNIFICANTLY increased my appetite.  (Note:  I did not have a problem with loss of appetite before taking Lexapro. I was at a healthy weight.)  I gained 25 lbs. in about 6 months which increased my pre-diabetic symptoms----The dry mouth was not a pleasant side effect....used Biotene products, small amount of relief.  Then, some months after the weight gain, I developed high blood pressure.  I tried coming off the Lexapro after taking it for 2 plus years per Dr.'s recommendations.  Did not do well. Felt like I was going to 'jump out of my skin'.  I very gradually came off the drug over a 3 month period which worked fairly well, but it was a pain.  The constipation was a very unpleasant side effect which led to hemorhoids (which I never had in my 50 plus years, not even pregnancy!) in spite of increasing fiber.  Almost NO libido, which my husband did not understand and had no empathy, but that was more his self-centered character. It definately had a negative impact on reconciling our marriage.  So, I should have tried another medication(s)...I had so much chaos at the time, I did was overwhelmed &/or did not care.

Started at 10mg, felt good for a week then anxiety hit me, went up to 15mg and I felt terribly sick, after another week my GP put me on 20mg,  I lasted 3 weeks at the 20mg and I just couldn't take it no more.  I was so sick.  I didn't eat for weeks, stomach upset, nausea,headaches, jitters, crying fits, more anxiety.  I was scared to be alone.  It was effecting my home life drastically. I ended up in emergency because of extreme dizzyness and throwing up.  The emerg doc said go back down to 10mg.  He thought it was to strong.  I got a couple shots in the arse.  One for nausea and other for stomach upset.  I was advised to see my regular GP.  The next day I seen my GP (Crying the whole time)  He basically said he didn't know what to do with me.  He put me back on a low dose of Paxil (12.5) and put a requisition in for me to see a psyciatrist (which will take 2 months to be able to see one)  So now I am dosing myself out with Clonozapam (1mg twice a day)..not driving...not working.  Keeping my child home from school to look after me (not fair!) and my husband gets home as soon as he can after work at each  night. I have never felt this bad/depressed and down right scared like this before.  Hoping the paxil cr will kick in quick so my family can stop worrying about me.  Never will I take Cipralex again!

It was very effective and I used it for about four years.  During that four years, I gained 110 pounds and did not even care--in fact, I cared about nothi8ng at all, or even doing anything at all.  Libdo went to absolutely zero.  Zombiefied.  Stopped taking the drug and developed severe anxiety attacks requiring another medication.  Additional negative side effects were slow but continual increasing nerve pain in feet and along the side of left leg.  Pain also began in right leg after experienceing it in left for several months. These pains totally disappeared in about two weeks after stopping Lexapro.  Evaluation is the drug does counteract depression but it can have severe side effects.  Be very careful and watch for adverse effects.  I would NOT recommend it to anyone.

I've been on 10mg of Lexapro for 2 years for anxiety due to loss of a very high income Wall Street job.  It took the edge off and allowed me to make very rational career, financial, and family decisions without unnecessary anxiety.  I have never been depressed.   Over two years, the side effects were 20-30 lbs of increased weight, and annoying decreased libido. 
Last week I've decided to transition to Wellbutrin XL and stop taking Lexapro.  The half-life of Lexapro is 27 hours, so I decided to taper Lexapro with the following schedule: Day0 10mg, Day1 5mg, Day2 5mg, Day3 2.5 mg, Day4 2.5mg, Day5 0mg, Day6 0mg.  Today is the end of Day6.  I’ve only had two withdrawal symptoms that are minor: slight dizziness and elevated tinnitus.  Tomorrow I will begin Wellbutrin XL 100mg.  I am hopeful that Wellbutrin will have the same calming effects  and completely reverse the weight gain and decreased libido.

Since Lexapro, I don't cry as much over small things, but big issues are still no use. I haven't had as many nightmares, but I did notice (since in the past i've missed taking it a few nights) I would get terrible nightmares, and feel so jittery  the next day that I almost had to leave school, since even though I have more of depression. Anxiety hyped me up to  an uncontrollable level. Be careful, guys. I not completely happy with Lexapro, but it does help a little more than halway so my opinion is that it is ""good"" but indeed no miracle drug."

It's simply been smooth sailing.  This drug is a good match for me :-)

I don't know about the rest of you, but I would get anxiety just from trying a new medication.  Which is why, since 200,7 I have been taking Ativan to keep my panic at bay. I was not happy with this at all because of it's addictive properties and it only worked for a period of time. I needed something that took the edge of the anxiety. I felt the Lexapro (10mg) work after about 7 days. I had an upset stomach for maybe the first 3 days. It has now been  1 1/2 months since I started Lexapro and I went from taking 3 mg of Ativan to .5 mg! In another few weeks I am going to STOP taking it all together! The only lingering side effect is a small amount of weight gain, maybe 5 lbs. It is totally worth it though to feel ""normal"". I can go a whole day with out feeling anxious! It really is a tremendous drug and can change your life if you give it the chance! "

I take 10 mg every morning. Initial symptoms (increased anxiety, irritability, sleepiness and sweating) have disappeared after a week. I can feel my anxiety subsiding after 5 days, and I feel ""normal"" after two weeks of being on the medication. 

The first time I took this was after the birth of my daughter (I was breastfeeding, and the doctor determined it was safe). I weaned off after four months (from 10 to 5 to 2.5) and had no issues. I am taking it again because of some stress in my life that triggered panic attacks.

The initial side effects are difficult to go through, and sometimes it feels like it's not working (or you want to give up) but I encourage you to stick it out. Once it starts to work, you will be so glad you did.

With that said, this medicine was to treat me for depression. But instead it made me have very vivid terrible dreams. It also made me have really messed up thoughts, it was like something had taken over my ability to think and had weird outlandish thoughts, creepy and psychotic as well. Dealing with depression was better than what this drug did to me. Needless to say I got off of it and am now taking generic Zoloft. Way better. I have had no side effects with gen. Zoloft. I know each drug effects different people differently..but wanted to post what I went through. Scary Stuff..hope no one ever goes through what I did on that drug.

It takes a few weeks to kick in but once you get your dosage figured out it really does help. It does not completely take away all of your symptoms but it comes pretty close to getting rid of them. I did not experience side affects except for when I did not take the medicine for a few days. I would get extremely nauseous and sometimes it resulted in vomiting. My doctor decided to change my medicine because after 6 years it seems that the medicine is no longer working which is to be expected after being on it for so long.

More recent, I was given this again by another healthcare provider to manage the strees and anxiety that I was experiencing which may be contributer to my recent high blood pressure.  

I took it for three days at first.  It was horrendous.  I couldn't sleep and awful dreams as well as irritable.  I left them alone for two months.  I believe that the formula has been changed drastically.  It is just different.  

Recently, I've felt like I needed something, so started back taking them again, this time everyday. 

I makes me feel better.  Heck I'm basically loopy for the first couple of hours after I take it and off and on for the rest of the night.  

I wouldn't advise taking this in the daytime.  I'd wait for bedtime or when you knew you weren't going out anywhere.  It will make you dizzy, loopy and sleepy.    

It helps me, but just be cautious as with any drug.   "

After 2 years of talk therapy and no improvement in my constant high anxiety, I agreed to see a psychiatrist. I thought he'd give me something like Xanax. He recommended Lexapro and I was initially extremely reluctant to get on a long-term drug. I finally agreed and am SO glad that I did. After only about 2 weeks, I already began to feel so much better. It's as if the background noise in my brain stopped and I could think clearly again. I took it for 9 months and was feeling so much better I decided to stop (without consulting my doc). Bad choice. Within 5 months I was an anxious, irritable mess again and went back on. Also upped my dosage from 20 mg to 30 mg. I've been back on for 4 months and am again feeling amazing, able to cope with daily life, keep things in perspective and I feel happy! I would highly recommend Lexapro to anyone who is suffering with anxiety that interferes with your daily life.

I was told it would help with symptoms of sudden menopause brought on by my cancer treatment. It didn’t. To my detriment, it enabled me to remain in a dangerous work environment for longer than I could have withstood it otherwise. I experienced many of the main complaints that others report including massive weight gain, total loss of libido, suicidal ideation, screaming nightmares, hypervigilance, and rages.  I also experienced severe withdrawal on two occasions. Once I could not get my medication on time through the mail order program I was forced to use. And once I left town without my medication. I became ill within hours of missing a dose and for three days was too ill to get myself back home. My symptoms included nausea, vomiting, the shakes, cold sweats, loss of coordination, and diminished cognition. I was given Lexapro in combination with other drugs, first one and then another, but Lexapro was the main one for an extended period. At one point, I was given dosing instructions for extended release capsules on a prescription of short acting tablets of Effexor. I had severe problems while on these drugs, ending up in the ER twice with symptoms of cardiomyopathy brought on by severe anxiety. It’s a wonder I lived through it. I’m not sure I will ever fully recover from it. My career ended as a result as did my sex life and my enjoyment of many activities I used to love. I am living a diminished life due to depression and anxiety and a new doctor wants me to try Lexapro again. I have decided not to risk revisiting that awful experience. For me, depression and anxiety are preferable to being driven stark raving mad due to having my brain chemistry altered, perhaps irreversibly, on drugs the effects of which are poorly understood at best and have the potential to cause irreversible harm at worst.

I've had good luck with prozac in the past. After months of severe anxiety (years without meds), I finally went to the doctor. I told him I wanted prozac though he recommended lexapro. I started with 10mg daily, in the evening. My anxiety level was higher than ever. 10 days later I went to 20mg with no positive results. After a month with lexapro, I have now switched to prozac. As soon as I weened myself off of lexapro (no prozac), my anxiety went away completely. I am also going through counseling, to rid myself of the anxiety for good. These drugs are like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. Therapy is the best way to learn to deal with things, hands down. The biggest reason I wanted to go with prozac is the price and how it worked for me in the past. A 30 day supply of lexapro is $35, while a 90 day supply of prozac is $10. Still, lexapro did nothing positive for me at all, even though my dosage was too low for anxiety. I also have a supply of xanax (.5mg)and use it sparingly. Get counseling!!!"

I tried and after a few months it did help with lots of syptoms (depression, anxiety, hot flashes, etc.). I decided I  needed to get off and start feeling life again. The drug just masks a lot of problems. Getting off after almost 7 years was HELL! I have been sick with flu-like symptoms for 9 weeks. I have to force myself to eat a little several times a day. The nausea has subsided but the anxiety, sweats, diareah, lightheadedness, and depression and wanting to end it all has not gone away. Thank God for my family and His help as I continue to reach full mental and physical health. I would never recommend this to anyone! It is just too hard to get off of as I am sure the company making it knows. It is also very expensive so they want us to be addicted to it. I am trying to gain knowledge of what foods and nutrients I need to overcome this. Oh, and I did gain about 40 pounds over the 7 years. Over 20 of it has gone in two months, but I feel like a starved animal that can't eat. I wonder if this is what anorexia feels like? 
899$Condition: Depression$4/5/2011 4:35:33 AM$Reviewer: Mello, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$The first week of lexapro was the hardest due to the side effects of nausea and dizziness.  But the results were immediate.  I have been taking it a few years now, and I have taken dosages from 10mg to 40mg.  I am back down to 20mg a day and holding.  I have gained weight while taking it.  I have come off lexapro twice for about a month each time only to recognize that life is better with it.  My doctor switched me to prozac in the beginning, but I quickly knew that wasn't a good fit, and he put me back on lexapro with a dose increase.  Life has been great after that.  To those who say that lexapro caused personality changes, I would say keep trying other meds.  I had that reaction to prozac.  Everyone's system is slightly different and will respond to a different med.  Keep trying meds until you can look back and say, yeah, life is definitely better with ---.  For me, life is better with lexapro.

He would constantly get angry about everything, randomly shun people. It was disturbing. His personality did a complete 180. This drug also cause him to start drinking later on to cope with the stress this drug made him feel. Overall it was a terrible experience.

I use this primarily for anxiety, and secondarily for depression. As I went off to college and began my life on my own, I realized how much anxiety I have and how difficult it makes life. I dropped out of college twice due to my anxiety. I had such terrible social anxiety that if I missed a class, I would be too afraid to even ask my teacher about what I missed. This would lead to an endless cycle of missing class and being to afraid to attend again. It also would lead to a helpless depression. I never went out or made new friends. It sounds stupid to be ""afraid"" of social situations, but it was ruining my life. Until I tried Lexapro, I had no idea how much anxiety I really had. I discovered that my life was being controlled by my anxiety. I couldn't even make phone calls to talk to people I didn't know or approach people, even in a professional setting. I couldn't get a job because I was to anxious to even go into a facility and ask for an application, let alone have a interview. I am now working full-time and going to college full-time, and have not had anxiety since I've been taking Lexapro. This medication has really been the best thing I have ever taken. The best way I can describe this medication is if you imagine having a light switch in your brain for anxiety/fear, and this just switches it off. I haven't had any negative side-effects from this, and only have good things to say."

When i was hospitalizedi was on zoloft (horribe drug) then they put me on lexapro 10 mg 1 time a day. I find that i need to take my medicine the exact same time everyday for it to be effective. I experienced nausea for the first week but it went away. Eating the medicine with food helped as well. I was taking 4 other medications and the hospital took me off of them and started lexapro a day after my admission. After being on lexapro for a month i feel that tired, i wanna sleep all day type of thing, i get upset very easily, but i have had a very tramatic 2010 so hopefully i can pull it together here and keep on truckin! I plan on asking my dr. if i should go up maybe to 15 or 20 mgs so i can get some energy. i sleep all day and stay up all night because of anxiety,and when i sleep during the day its always in and out, never a deep comfortable sleep. The medicine has kept my weight at a stand still which is beneficial because when i was on all of the other meds i was gaining between 5-7 lbs a month. Overall i plan to give the drug more time to work, and hopefully when i get some energy to get a job again and live that normal life that everyone with depression would give up their arm for. The winter blues don't help the depression situation either. Hope this was helpful to all of you.

I have experienced depression for over 20 years.  This is the only one that finally made me feel ""normal"".  I stopped getting angry over every little thing, I stopped worrying about minor things, I was very happy.  I have since weaned myself off of this drug, it has taken over 9 months.  It is VERY hard to get off and you need to be committed to weaning yourself very slowly.  It will make you crazy if you don't.  The reason I am weaning myself off of this medication is for two reasons.  The first being that I have gained over 10 pounds on the 5 years that I taken it.  I CANNOT lose weight no matter how I eat or exercise. It has affected my metabolism in some way.  The second reason is that it has affected my libido in a negative way.  I have very little interest in sex.  It has not affected my ability to climax, but just the ""getting going"" part.  I am now realizing that I still need medication, my irritability and anxieties have returned.  I need to find something that will help me without the negative side effects."

Around this time a year ago, I was in an ambulance on my way to the hospital for an overdose and alcohol poisoning. I had to leave college, and entered a period of several weeks during which I could not even bring myself to leave my bed. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, put on suicide watch, and prescribed Lexapro. Today, I am happy to report that I have found myself again. I work at a job several days a week, I go out with friends, and I am applying to transfer to a new college. I haven't felt the hopelessness that I used to feel in many months, and I consider myself a content person. This was by no means an easy or short road. Lexapro is not a magic pill that will have you waking up the next day smiling like Vanna White. It took several difficult months of adjustment, and it's not a pill that works for everyone. I still have sadness and depression occasionally, like any person will. It doesn't interfere with my ability to live a happy, successful life anymore, though. I know that I will also face difficult when weening off the medication, but I am prepared for that. The most important thing that I have learned from this is that there is never a reason to give up. Depression doesn't define you, and it isn't forever. Your life isn't blanketed in nighttime like you might think, it is actually just a cloud obscuring your sunlight, and it's ok if you need a little help moving out from behind that cloud.

I seem to have ADD also, but that could also be caused from the Anxiety. I hate to be on Lexparo for the rest of my life, but it seems that might be the case.

I started on 10mg and felt spacey so dropped to 5mg. I have been at this dose for 2.5 years. I have been pleasantly surprised at the result - I know I am ""on"" something but it does not get in the way of my daily activity. I am able to let go of hostile situations more easily. I am able to ""choose my battles"" easier. It gives me a bit of a pause button so I am not so quick to become overwhelmed, sad, upset, angry. I still do feel these emotions, just have more control of them. I once forgot my medication on a week long trip and the withdrawal was tolerable, but I would not recommend it! Several times throughout the day I would get some flashes behind my eyes and the world would seem to vibrate for a few seconds, then it would pass. As far as starting the drug or changing the dose, ""they"" say that the drug takes 2 weeks to take effect. Maybe in most patients but not this one! No kidding, I increase my dosage to 10mg and I feel it within hours. Now I increase my dose to 10mg for a few days around my cycle and it helps with the severe PMS/PMDD I experience. Maybe all in my head? I chart my cycle and there are many more PMS-induced arguments when I don't take the increased dose! The only bummer I can tell is low libido. Yeah, BUMMER. Well, the price of the drug is another bummer. As a cost savings I tried something similar - a generic called citalopram - it was AWFUL! It made me feel more than spacey - very messed up and more emotional. Good luck!"

I have noticed I have extremely low libido however (as in I have to be reminded bc I don't ever even think of it) and I'm only 24 so it shouldn't be a natural problem.

I probably shouldn't have taken it then, but my Dr wanted to try it and see if chest tightness, panic attacks, and thumpy heartbeat went away.  I did notice very vivid dreams during the first 2 weeks on it.  The dreams weren't scary, just very very vivid.
I stopped Lexapro in 2008 and experienced some withdrawl symptoms, the worst being the ""brain zaps"", feeling like electrical jolts were running through my brain.  That lasted about a week and then went away.

I recently went on Lexapro again in 2010 for anxiety and depression and the return of physical symptoms (thought I was having a heart attack, but it was anxiety).  Upon starting Lexapro again, I didn't have any vivid dreams but my physical symptoms went away.
Now I take 10 Mg/day and, while the physical symptoms are gone, my mood is rather neutral, rather than happy or sad.  Also, libido is very low.  Weight gain has occured, even though I don't really feel hungry most of the time.
However, while some of the side effects annoying and bothersome, not to mention the cost of the drug, Lexapro has been very helpful in getting me out of the hole I was stuck in."

However, my depression eventually relapsed, and despite continually upping the dose until it was past the range of tested clinical efficacy (40 mg), I was still depressed nearly every day for two months, characterized by low energy and motivation, as well as occasional, fleeting suicidal ideations. I was prescribed bupropion to take in conjunction with the lexapro, giving me substantial increases in energy and motivation which I felt that lexapro had sapped from me. However, bupropion did nothing to fix lexapro's sexual side effects, which had once been mild but were now approaching borderline-impotence. I decided that I'd enough of this; thus, I tapered off the lexapro over the course of a month, during which I experienced persistent ""brain zaps"", increased agitation, lowered energy, lowered concentration, suicidal ideations, and derealization.  However, once the influence of this horrible substance had completely left my system, I began feeling back on track with the bupropion. I still suffer from depression but I'm much more functional, focused, and motivated than before.  In conclusion, Lexapro did nothing but potentiate my depression.  I will never put another SSRI in my system again."

Never had a need to take any meds prior to 2 years ago, but ""mid-life"" brought with it an almost-debilitating level of anxiety. Lexapro worked quickly and efficaciously. I did gain about 25 pounds, but this might be related to my naturally-slowing metabolism at this stage of my life...hard to say. Have been watching my calories and getting moderate exercise, and have dropped 10 of the 25 pounds. Really great med for anxiety."

However within a week of trying this medication I noticed a significant increase in my appetite, which was unacceptable. It was actually difficult for me to feel full, even if I ate more than my body needed. If I stayed on Lexapro I would have been very upset by the weight gain, so although the drug might be helpful to others it was very unaffective for me. I also wasn't on it long enough to see any changes in my depression.

This has really helped keep my emotions in control and also not get upset at my husband and kids so easily. I was given 10mg but I take half of my pill since I am really sleepy on 10mg. Some people take it at night but I take mine in the morning. I turned 40 and it seems that without lexapro I am crying and/or upset all the time. I have gained maybe 5-10 lbs since being on this but I try to exercise and not eat huge meals in the evening. I recommend this for women who are crying a lot and are easily upset.

I noticed change in my mood right away but I'm still having some difficulty when my period is approaching. I am considering asking my doctor to increase the dose. I do have more energy, I have been sleeping better and I seem to handle every day tasks (and my 2 small children) much better. I have experienced very vivid and realistic dreams but that doesn't bother me. The only downside for me is difficulty having orgasm, however, I wouldn't consider discontinuing it.

You are crippled in random extreme crying, headaches/migraines and more. I started taking Lexapro in January 2010 at 5mg. after 4 months I had to move up to 10mg because 5mg wasn't enough. 5 months later I started taking 20mg and I've been on 20mg ever since and it's working very well. Next week I am moving up a dose to help me deal with my recent surgery pain and anxiety. The withdrawal symptoms are horrible. You get weird brain buzzes, and my hands and feet go numb, and I get dizzy. But that's if I miss 3 doses or more in a row. Overall Lexapro works very well if you remember to take it correctly and if you are honest with your doctor on how effective your dosage is. I hope I helped!

I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg two days ago and I was crying/angry/severely depressed within a few hours.  Nausea, too.  I'm used to this side effect because I felt the same increased anger/anxiety with both Zoloft and Wellbutrin after about 4-5 days, so I'm really going to try to stick with it to see if symptoms improve.  I'm frustrated that I don't seem to respond to these meds well.  I just need something to work.  I could barely leave the house the past few days.  I'll give it another 2 weeks (maybe) and if symptoms of anxiety and anger don't improve, I'm giving up on Lexapro, too.  I'm willing to put up with this very temporarily, but I was honestly doing better BEFORE starting Lex than I am now.  This med is still better than Zoloft, which was a nightmare for me.  The best drug I've been on so far (for me) was Pristiq.

I've resisted adding any further medications for quite sometime, but can no longer do that as I don't want s/s to manifest themselves when I am at work. I agreed to try Lexapro as it is 1 that I had not tried yet.  I have only been taking 5mg at bedtime for about 2 weeks now. I don't think that there has been any changes yet. I know that a true trial will require more time on the medication. So far, I have noticed no side effects. Why can a person not regain the seratonin that is reportedly lost with depression?? If your blood count is low or blood chemistry is off it can be replaced.  Why not seratonin?? I would like to not be taking any medications at some time in my life. What is on the horizon in the treatment of depression?? I want to get off medications.  I am otherwise healthy.  Technical and rock climb, back country backpack, hike, and other outdoor activities.  I do have phototherapy at times during the year.  "

This drug made it possible for me to carry on--no more shaking or uncontrollable crying.  The doctor says I need to be on it 9 months total then try to get off it.  Side effects like being tired all the time were bad in the first few weeks but then tapered off.  Once the very stressful times were gone, I was tired again and had short term memory loss.  The doctor says I could probably decrease my dosage now but he wants to leave things alone through the holidays.  To me the benefits of this med outweigh the costs.

I took it the first night and the next morning I had pins and needles.  I suspected I had a reaction to other medications.  However, I continued taking Lexapro for a week before stopping.  After another week, I returned to my doctor and reported the problems.  He told me there should be no problem with other medications and to start it again.  I did, but with the same results...pins and needles.  I stopped again but then started a month or so later only to have pins and needles again.  I stayed on Lexapro for about another 2-3 months.  I used Percocet to help control the pins and needles.  Those two drugs became my daily ritual.  However, I moved from Lexapro to Xanax and found a lot more relief while still using the Percocet.  Later, I also developed burning sensations.  I now have all three--pins, needles, and burning sensations (PNBS), a new acronym.  I have tried incessantly to get rid of these problems, but still have them.  I basically live on oxycodone (Percocet without the Tylenol) at least 3-5 times a week with an occasional Xanax.  I've tried every herbal known to man with little success.  I contacted the makers of Lexapro to ask for a solution, but their cop-out was that my doctor would have to treat me and that they could do nothing.  Now I see why people sue pharmaceutical companies.  Good luck on Lexapro.  But, if you experience PNBA right away, my advice is to stop it immediately and never return.  The PNBA is horrible!

Also an unexpected result, I suffer from chronic neck pain, but it's been completely gone since taking lexapro! I've read studies on antidepressants treating pain, and I guess that's what happened!

I am also an alcoholic. My Dr wanted me to start with 5 mg and after a few weeks move up to 10. At first it was great but when I went up to 10 mg I had the side effects of sweating at night, vivid dreams and heavy menstrual periods. I felt zoned out too. I even had a major panic attack so I stopped taking it. Well the feelings of anxiety and despair came creeping back and I started drinking again. A few months ago I decided to quit drinking for good and I started 5 mg of Lex again. No symptoms this time! After a month I went up to 10 mg and still no side effects! I feel great.. no social anxiety! I am finally able to live, for myself and my children. And I am proud to say that I am 3 months sober and I believe the Lexapro has helped. The only downside is that I have heard the withdrawals are terrible. Someday I hope to be able to wean off of the meds but for now I am enjoying life again!

Since being off the medicine totally she has not had one bleeding espisode not even a drop of blood in GI track/rectum. 

This drug is dangerous and should be given a better warning lable than is on there now.  I almost lost my mom in Nov 2009 and Jan 2010 before I took her off meds and told doctors I was 100% sure that was the problem.  I am not saying it is not going to help for some but not for seniors who have possible underlying conditions.  I would not want anyone to go through what I and my families have gone thru because of this. It also effected her brain function and now her memory and able to talk (slurring her words) and her gait is off really badly.  Pain mgmt dr presecribed it to her for pain not for depression.

I have moved on with my life and I am naturally happy and no longer wish for death so I went off the drug. I am having a serious withdrawl problem when I was told there were no side effects or dependency problems So I started the ""weaning"" steps. I fall over, I have shooting dizziness again and it makes me feel very ill. I hope that ""it"" will stop within 3 weeks. I also had to stop this medication as my ex took my insurance away from me and I am 100% uninsurable due to 2 declineable diseases and I cannot afford this drug. If there were a generic, I would stay on it only because of being so sick trying not to take it anymore. Great Pro's to this drug, but a huge price to pay coming off of the drug thus explaining the satisfaction rating."

It continues working just fine w/out pooping out nor needing a dosage increase. I started at 20mg because when Forrest introduced Celexa they said 20mg was the average dose-it was later proven that 40mg was the average effective dose. Over the years Lexapro has also shown that 20mg is the average effective dose. Sex drive can be an issue if your relationship is based on same. On the other hand, the love drive on this med increases significantly. If you were severely depressed and unable to eat/losing weight-you will regain your appetite-weight. If you were moderately depressed and over eating you may slow down and lose weight or not sometimes. Aerobic exercise will help w/the depression and the weight-but you have to ""Just do it!""

Now 53. Same Dr. for all this time. He tried everything. The ones that worked really well had side effects such aas too agressive, (Iwas very sensitive before), weight gain on another, prozac did not do much. Dr. put me on Lexepro and it has worked much faster and worked great. I only have problems when I go off of it due to thinking I am o.k. now, sometimes can't afford it, no insurance,ect. This drug has worked better than any without side effects. If I stop taking it I get weepy and anger easily. I would reccomend this to anyone who see's that it is helping them. It worked pretty much right away for me. I also have been on xanax for 25 years for panic disorder. If it works, don't try going off of it unless Dr. tells you to. I maake that mistake a lot, and it has caused problems. Cheemical imbalance runs in my family, and I will always be on meds. Before Lexepro I had 3 suicide aattempts, last one they brought me back twice. No probleems or even thoughts since Lexepro. Hope this will help someone.

I rarely ever take antibiotics and cant stand people that medicate every little problem they have.  But, after a devestating divorce I found myself severely depressed and for the first time asked my doctor for help for what he called ""situational depression.""  Initially, it made me feel horrible, panicky and unable to sleep, but was told to at least give my body a month to get used to it.  Within a couple of weeks, I felt calmer, happier and less stress.  As my body got used to the drug, I was able to sleep better and actually lost weight on this drug!  I would absolutely recommend trying it.  AFter about 8 mos., I decided to get off of it and found it very difficult!  Severe dizziness, crying spells and sadness.  I tapered slowly and side effects are gone, however I feel depressed again and debating about going back on this med."

Very low during pregnancy to very high after pregnancy to a moderate dosage during other times of life.  I have found very few side effects with this medicine.  One I think might be related to this medicine is low sexual libido and the inability to orgasm.  However, it might not be this medicine, it could be the anti-anxiety medicine I am currently taking.

I visited him for several days before he died.  I had to have a security officer standing behind me.  Because of the stress I developed severe heart attack symtoms.  Since I was in the hospital already I went to the ER to be checked out.  After every test available the doctors determined this was an anxiety attack.  I have been taking 10 mg of Lexapro and 10 years later I have worked as a hospice chaplain and addiction counselor and have not had another attack. I think it helps me feel more calm.  My daughter who is a social worker in child protective services also takes Lexapro and we feel it has helped us cope with our tough jobs and not feel anxious.

I got a check up a week ago and I told her that I wasn't feeling any better over all but she said I had to keep at it to feel any better. (she also added clonazapam...which doesn't do anything! they chould be sugar pills for all they do)...  About 45 min after I take the lexapro I feel really out of it ""trippy"". That is the best part to look forward to. I can just space out and not worry.  I take it at night before I go to bed so I don't have to worry about functioning. But the next day, 12 hours later I still get really nervous driving to work because I have a hard time paying attention to the road.  My anger, and anxiety are the same if not worse at times. I have noticed that sometimes I am more obsessed with organizing things and stressing if things aren't in there place which isn't normal. I have to wait another month and go back to the doc.  I hope it either starts working or I can switch to something that actually works. Maybe my expectations are unrealistic.  But feeling alittle better would be better than nothing. "

I don't feel the sense of panic in certain situations where I did before. I don't have as many negative thoughts & as strong as a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. I generally feel more positive. However, while I was having sex last night it was dramatically different. I have been very sexually active & usually enjoy it very much, but last night I felt nothing other than the tactile sensations. I felt like there was no way I would even come close to orgasming. & my boyfriend was doing the same things he has always been doing which previously had been very successful. Also, I have noticed that I've gained a couple pounds. I do kind of feel like a zombie but I'm not complaining because I function even better & it's a lot better than chronic panic & despair. I just feel a lot more apathetic about things.

After about two weeks I noticed a difference in anxiety and mood.  I have been on this medication for a year straight now and I have not gained any weight. Don't get off the medication if you gain weight, possibly the weigh gain is due to a change in metabolism or diet and/or exercise.  This drug may have saved my life.  I tried Effexor first and it made me aggressive and hostile.  Lexapro affects less neurotransmitters so I think people should try it for depression first before trying Effexor.

I was in a really bad place at that point and Lexapro was a last resort (never thought I'd ever need a pill). The initial symptoms of dizziness and increased anxiety were a real pain and it took almost a month before I started to feel better. To make matters worse, it hurt my libido too. But I stuck with it and it eventually did have a very positive effect on my life. The only easy part was actually when I stopped taking it cold turkey after a year and felt zero side effects. Score!

Once again I've been going through some moderate depression/anxiety and am starting to take it again. My overall depression and anxiety are milder this time and I'm noticing the benefits almost immediately with only mild dizziness right after I take it. i hate the idea of taking these pills but I'm getting over it because they definitely help."

It helped me control my depression and anxiety.  I knew that I had to ween off this medication slowly; I had taken other SSRIs in the past (Paxil, Zoloft) and it is NOT a good idea to stop all at once, you need a plan to ween off these meds.  I started to ween myself off and had terrible side affects - dizziness, a strange head zapping feeling and increased anxiety.  I decided to stay on Lexapro awhile longer as I was busy with work and travel for my job and couldn't deal with a dizzy head.  A few months ago, I slowly started to ween off again.  My doctor told me to cut the pill in half and take 5mg each day, then after 1 week take 5mg every other day, then every 2 days.  I took it even slower and took 5mg every other day for 1 month until I felt I was ready to stop completely.  I had the same side affects - dizzy head, zapping feeling in my brain, weird body aches.  I stuck with my plan and after 2 weeks, the side affects completely disappeared and I felt completely normal.  I have not had any issues since.  My advice is to ween off slowly and stick it out if you have some mild side affects from withdrawl, because they will go away.

I then stopped for another year and started taking Lexapro.  This drug was very effective.  The doctor prescribed 10mg but I did my research and decided to start with the lowest dose which is 5mg, and have been taking that dosage for 3yrs.  The first 2 weeks showed increased symptoms but it gradually lessened and now I'm fine.  Only side effect is a dramatic decrease in libido, I can ejaculate but it's not nearly powerful as it was.  Otherwise, the drug is good.  The initial 10mg is definitely not necessary (for me).  It was much healthier (and easier) to bump up the dosage when seems fit than to start off on a real high dosage.

It totally changed my life for the best. But, like an idiot I thought that I needed to come off it to prove that I could overcome the anxiety and did it right after I got laid off. Bad idea, because it rebounded hard and threw me back into a tailspin. Fortunately, the initial relief comes within a week or so for me and I had a leftover bottle from March that I started myself back on. It's a good thing too because I could definitely feel things starting to slip away again. I can honestly say I'm going to be on it and stay on it for a while now while I work on handling stress better and not worrying about the great unknown.

It was so bad I had to crawl to the bathroom to throw up. The entire next day I was sick to my stomach and unable to keep any food down, extreamly dizzy, and I had a horrible headache and could not take pain reliever due to drug interaction warning. I thought my body would get used to it by the next day, so again at 6pm I took the 10mg dose and tried to quickly go to bed. I had difficulty getting to sleep, staying asleep, and night sweats both nights. Woke up for work at 3am vomiting again, the same headache and inability to keep food down, but now I had developed shivers (teeth chattering) and excessive sweating. I feel like I have had the worst flu of my life for three days and am terrified to take another dose.

When being on the medication for two weeks I suddenly became very dizzy and went to ER vomiting.  ER doctor decided it was due to the medication and said to quit taking Lexapro and the dizziness should go away in a few days.  Medication for nausea and dizziness given but did no good.  The next day the vomiting stopped, but the dizziness continued and I had to stay in bed with my eyes closed to tolerate it.  On the third day I went to my regular doctor who agreed that it was from the Lexapro and I should be back to normal in a couple more days.  So far, not the case.  The dizziness is a little better and I am no longer vomiting, but I am unable to focus on things for very long.  I am too dizzy to drive and am not sure if I can work tomorrow.  This has been a terrible experience.  I have taken quite a few different anti-depressants with no reactions at all.  This is very scary.

1253$Condition: Depression$6/9/2010 3:07:13 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$Lexapro was the one that worked for me after trying Zoloft and Serafim. Side effects I initially experienced was shaky hands and a dullness to my short term memory. One of the unusual things that happened was when an anxiety would hit I could feel the release from my brain down my arms like a tingling sensation. Very trippy experience and definitely snapped me out of the anxiety. I have been on this drug for a year and a half. Just recently weened off of it and feel pretty good. Definitely recommended. Did gain a bit of weight and slight dip in my sexual apetite. but all manageable and worth it.

I had multiple fainting spells the first week I was on it. It makes me dehydrated to the point that my limbs tremble uncontrollably. I was drinking 4 liters of water a day and was constantly thirsty with a dry mouth. I went several weeks where I had INTENSE panic attacks, worse than I'd ever had before, upon waking up. I was constantly tired, often sleeping 18+ hours per day. My doctor was convinced I had mono, that it wasn't the Lexapro that was making me so exhausted, and refused to take me off until I had been on it for 6 months. Now I'm switching to Celexa, and I'm terrified of the side effects. My experience with Lexapro was the worst 6 months of my life.

Before that I was all stressed out and had high anxiety.  At first the doctor prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro.  While Lexapro didn't totally eliminate my anxeity it made it very manageable.  It allowed me to function well at work and school. I no longer had panic attacks, heart palpatations, eye twitching, insomnia or a general fear I was going to die.  After a few years I did up my dosage to 20 mg because of more stress.  The main thing was keeping my anxiety manageable, which Lexapro does for me.

I found out thru counseling that I have minor A/D/D issues also. Although I don't anyone claiming Lexapro helps with it, I feel it helped me.  I took the medication until my counselor and I agreed that I ""may not need it any longer"". Gradual weening off of it was recommended but we misplaced the refill right before I deployed and had no choice but to go cold-turkey.  I was ok, with minor, if any, adverse side effects.  I would recommend giving this one a try if your Dr and/or counselor says so... "

For three years my mother suffered from a fever of unknown origin. Tylenol,ibuprofin nothing could brak the fever. i took her to multiple doctors specialists. and talked her into several procedures including bone marrow biopsies and polyp removal in her sinuses to try and get rid of this debilitating fever,malaise, fatigue and weakness.she lost 30 punds and nearly died of dehydration.After the 20th dr said he coulnt help and she told me she was ready to pass and couldnt live like this anymore i looked lexapro up in a drug book and the symptoms she had were listed. she stopped taking lexapro and the fevers and other symptoms went away. no dr bothered to look up side effects of this med and my mother almost left us. this is not a common side effect. lexapro was the miracle drug for my own depression,i wouldnt be here now without it. just please be aware of what you are taking and possible side effects. we cant leave it all to the drs we must be our own advocates in our healthcare.  Lexapro is an effective treatment for most people. This message is out there in case anyone is suffering like my mother did and is searching for answers because the drs have let them down.

1323$Condition: Depression$5/4/2010 11:14:27 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been suffering from Anxiety/Depression all my life. It was impossible for me to feel happy even when nothing was going 'badly' in my life. Finally, I sought help and was prescribed Lexapro. The first week I would wake up with dry mouth, migraines, and felt nauseous. I stuck it out though, and the side effects subsided within a week. Now, I have been able to function and reason through my problems without all the anxiety that I previously attached to them. Instead of going through the motions of being 'normal', I actually feel good. It's not a wonder drug in that it takes away your problems, but it gives you the boost you need to rationalize and work through issues. I can honestly say this is one of the best decisions I've made for myself, and I will continue my treatment.

I was first perscribed Zoloft and was experiencing some side effects (headache, upset stomach) and I didn't know if it was working to help with my anxiety and depressive sypmtoms. Maybe a little I thought, but I just really wanted to stop feeling down and hard on myself.  
   So I switched to 20mg of Lexapro and it was something completely different.  It is amazing to understand what happens when you find the right medication that works for you.  I am feeling so much better and am thankful to be a happy person again.  "

Lexapro has completly changed my life for the good!

I take 10mg each day. Upon starting the medication, I did vomit the first day and then felt nauseous each morning for about the first week. After that all nausea feelings went away.

The 2 major side effects that I suffer most from with this medication are increased persperation and problems ejaculating. I sometimes have twitches, but usually right after I wake up. Sometimes concentrating is hard, especially when multi-tasking. Occasionally, I experience forgetfullness like walking into a room to get something and not remembering what it was when I get there.

I have not experienced any issues with weiht gain, regular nausea, or night sweats. I actually feel that I get a better nights sleep since I have been using Lexapro. As mentioned, my persperation level has increased especially when I am active. (sports, exercising, etc.). Ejaculation has been prolonged and sometimes never, since I have started usage.
It does not seem that alcohol consumption  intensifies the effect, but I only drink socially. 

My doctor said this would be the best medication for a person in my age group with the least amount of side effects and referred to it as a ""chill pill"". Things that use to irritate me, seem to not bother me at all now. It just rolls right down my back.

Prior to taking my first dose I read the reviews here on Web Md, and was a little hesitant and even scared about taking it. After the nausea and sick feeling I wanted to stop after the first few days and stuck it out. Give it time to get into your system and start working. It only took a week for me. Everyone around me that knows I take it can see a differnce in my personality. I went for about 3 years before I spoke with my doctor about anxiety issues. I could not imagine living like I previously did. Lexapro is the best!!! Highly recommend!"

I used to go to a ""dark place"" very frequently during my adult life.  Whenever I was happy, I was the life of the party.  I could always be social and entertaining if alcohol was used.  Now I can have fun without it.  My days are so much more under control. My marriage was threatened because of my unpredictable behaviors.  I would be gleeful one day, and overspend, then be withdrawn and silent for the next week.  I really believe that there is a chemical reason for the behaviors that lexapro controls.  The only negative is that since I have been taking the drug, I have been drinking beer more heavily than ever--almost daily.  Once I get started I cannot stop until bedtime.  I have a bit of a sexual dysfunction as well.  Sometimes it is difficult to maintain an erection.  I'm not sure if it is from the medication or the drinking.  I wonder if the medication enhances the addictive behavior regarding the alcohol, and if so, would another SSRI possibly work as well with less side effects?  I know I should talk to my physician about this, but I am ashamed to talk about the addiction. Even so, my days are so much better, I feel contented. Little things that used to bother me, just don't now.  It's funny, but if I forget to take the lexapro, I can really feel a difference in my mood and interactions with others.  "

Anyways, they started me out taking 1/2, once everyother day for 4 days, then take 1 a day (to build it up in my system). Well, two days after i started taking a whole pill, i guess it built up enough in my system because i had a MAJOR reaction to it. My husband thought that i was high or something (and i felt it), i couldn't take care of my week old son, i felt terrible and just wanted to die. We couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, but luckily my mother-in-law was also on it and had kept the paper explaining the effects of an allergic reaction. I was shaking uncontrolably, felt as though i couldn't breath, wasn't able to hold myself up, it was bad. Anyways, my hasband took me to the hospital, they left me in the waiting room for 2 hours and i just got worse. We ended up leaving to go to another hospital, and on the way drop our son of to his sister. She called the ambulance to meet us at her house, and when we pulled up, i got out of the car and ended up falling on the ground (basically blacked out). The ambulance showed up right after and put me in and gave me that epie pen shot. It helped instantly. Anyways, i'm not writing this to say that it's a bad med (it worked wonders for my mother-in-law), I'm just writing this to warn people to watch out for a reaction and to get to the hospital immediatally if you feel off like that. I hope no one has to go thru that pain, but i do know that it happens, so be careful. I hope this helps at least one person.

I have been on it for 6 years. My doctor diagnosed me with a seratonin deficiency. She suggested that I take 1/2 a pill for the first week as it could cause nausea. That worked for me. I never have had sexual side effects either and I think it's because I take it at night. 10mg dose made me tired all the time, so I asked my doctor if I could just take 1/2 a pill. It controls my depression and I am not tired from it. The one thing I do notice is that I am not as motivated to do things as I used to be. I don't know if it's my age or the pills. All I know is I used to cry about everything and now I'm a much happier, easy-going person. It's a great medicine.

Wonderful at first!, I was way more easy-going. got along better with my husband, no longer got upset over all the little things or brooding over bullshit. The BEST part was I was no longer screaming at my 6 and 4 yr old kids(still hate myself about that), i stopped losing my temper over nothing, slowed down to enjoy them and stop demanding perfection   and precision  from my children. Then I also stopped having orgasms and no longer wanted sex at all really. Still loved the intimacy but could care less about intercourse. My husband said,""oh, come on, its a small price to pay to be happier"" (he wanted me to continue)""your so much easier to get along with, its been great!"" Yeah great for him, but it sucked for me to have my head in the clouds yet dead from the waist down at 40. I dont know I still wrestle with going back on to be a better mom, thats my real only goal. Yet my marriage was like living with a buddy cute, but NO interest in sex. Husband complained I was so ""asexual, its sad"" yet pushed me to stay on drug anyway to be ""happier"" Im disapointed it didnt seem a fair trade off, im too young to not want to feel sexual, but my kids are growing fast and I dont want them to only remember an uptight mean mommy. Still contemplating going back on. BTW had no bad side effects going off, I tapered well."

Obviously these kinds of medications work differently with each person, but I would strongly recommend it. Everyone who knows I am on can tell a huge difference, and I can too. Another great thing about it is that despite common rumors, it doesn't turn you into an emotionless zombie. It just returns you to how you would feel when you're happy and full of life. I'm really please with Lexapro and hope that everyone who tries it has similar results to mine. Good luck.

This stuff worked great until I couldn't orgasm (are you kidding me?), had severe short-term memory problems, vicious headaches related to any protein I ate, intense homicidal thoughts, GERD, hernia, osteoporosis and soft, mushy, girly skin. So I got off of it and then my head felt like it almost exploded. Literally I had this horrible, intense pressure inside my head and I got numerous dilated blood vessels and red dots all over my body but especially on my face and left side of my neck. I also got intense chest pains and burning skin (pure torture). My left leg wouldn’t stop shaking. My left eye muscles kept twitching continuously. I spoke rapidly. I couldn’t concentrate on the simplest things and make any healthy decisions. I had severe insomnia, paranoia, severe inner tension, severe restlessness, severe fatigue and my depression and anxiety were now 10 times worse than before I ever took this stuff. I have never had any of these symptoms before I took this drug. I followed exactly my doctor’s instructions about how to take it and how to get off of it but it didn’t make any difference. When I told him about all the withdrawal symptoms he gave me the usual stupid doctor CYA response, “it must be something else and I have never heard of this.” What a moron. I just got off this stuff and two days later my head explodes and his idiotic logic is that something else out of the blue descended on me to cause these problems. Is this the best doctors have? You can’t be serious!!! I am better off taking cocaine than this stuff.

I was prompted by a marriage counselor to go to my doctor and request drugs for my OCD symptoms (checking, intrusive sad thoughts, previous eating disorders as a teen and heavy drinking-probably perpetuated by my father’s suicide in 1981 while he was on imipramine and numerous other psych med’s)  I went to my husband’s pcp who never met me before.  He gave me a depression self-test and diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, and then prescribed me Lexapro and Rozerem since I had a terrible insomnia problem.  He also decided it was a good idea to start kissing me and grabbing me in his office.    The Lexapro did such a good job getting me up and doing things, lots of things, but unfortunately, I believe it also may have made me nervous because it raised my blood pressure from it’s usual 120/80 to 145/110.  I was really up, up, up.   I could drink twelve shots of straight liquor and still be walking around for hours.  This was the busiest year of my life.  I managed to get 2 DUI’s  4 drunk in publics and an involuntary commit for suicide, attend 2 rehab’s, a hypnotherapist, weekly ASAP programs, all while working full time.  During the course of my medical treatment,  I was seen by 3 psychiatrists, 4 doctors, and numerous counselors.  Most of the follow up treatment involved numerous more drugs, anti-buse, campral, and Buspar.  All of which I had to stop taking  due to side effects such as full body tremors and falling down.   Finally, after the second DUI which I was also charged with a felony for pinching a police officers butt, I decided maybe I should stop taking the Lexapro b/c I seemed to have developed some obsession with alcohol and I could see I was also becoming delusional.  So, while in jail, I requested no more medication for 1 week and was able to fully withdraw from Lexapro, although the depression side effects of the withdrawal lasted about three months.  I met

My son and daughter-in-law decided to never let me and my husband see our grandchild again.  I was unable to perform tasks, couldn't be around happy people, and I couldn't look or go anywhere my grandchild would like. The grief was unbelievable.  I was taking care of him 24/7. My daughter-in-law is a borderline personality. And my son did anything to make her happy.
Lexapro helped me function.  However, now I am experiencing inability to focus normaly and my memory scares me. I wake up in the middle of the night regularly.  Sex is history.  I can't wait to get off it now that I am coming back to life.

I was also told that it would make me a happy camper.  Instead, it reduced my nightly sleep from a solid 3 - 4 hour stretch to maybe 1 - 2 hours a night!  After a week, the total loss of appetite and inability to eat or drink ANYTHING (everything tasted like cardboard and the smell of food repulsed me), along with the hand tremor that developed, forced me to stop taking it!  My life had quickly become worse that I could have imagined.  I had NO ability to focus on ANYTHING.  I had no emotions.  The sleep deprivation was killing me.  It took over a week for my body to fully recover from the side effects.  Then I was told to try Celexa.  That produced increased insomnia, only now instead of feeling on a caffeine high, like I had with Lexapro, I felt like when you have a stomach flu.  I tossed and turned and was unable to even rest in bed.  Now the doctor wants me to try Zoloft.  I am losing patience!

I could not understand why it was not working until my doctor said that it was a long term side effect that impacts 25% of patients.  I wish I had known because for 4 years I have attributed my weight gain to laziness or lack of discipline (even though I maintained a healthy diet and exercised regularly).

The nausea and inability to get off the couch or out of bed was unbearable.  Had to even stuggle to force myself to complete a routine task, like brush my teeth.  I had a horrible chemical smell in my nose and down my throat.  Also had wierd vivid dreams and burning feeling on hands and feet.  I live in a prone position and was sleeping about 16 hours per day.  Let's don't forget to mention the diahrea. Dr. started me on 5 mgs. daily and then was to increase to 10 mgs. after one week.  The day I was to increase to the 10 mgs. I wanted to die, not due to depression, but due to being so sick and getting physically sicker every day.  I instead went to the emergency doctor on call (it was during the 2009 holiday season) and he placed me on Zoloft.  I did not continue to get sicker each day, but a tiny better.  It took over three weeks for all of the Laxapro side effects to subside.  Seems my body is allergic to it and taking it made me feel as if I was slowly poisioning myself.  Even when someone says the name of the medicine, I get nauseated.  Doing way way way better on the Zoloft for the present.

I took the first dose at night before going to bed and immediately felt calmness. The next morning I awoke refreshed and went through the entire day with extreme calmness. I forgot what it is like to feel this calm! Even went through my first career-oriented interview (I'm a soon-to-be college grad) and was EXTREMELY calm and content. My mood has gone from gloomy to neutral/happy in  just two days. Side effects for me were nausea and (embarrassing to admit) a tingly sensation in my penis. Other than that, thus far it is working and I am hoping it will continue to do so!

I had to do something and had a panic attack in front of everyone. I remember thinking ""How do you breath and speak at the same time."" Every time I had to do this task, I got scared. Three weeks ago, I thought I was dying. I went to doctor and told me it as panic disorder. They gave me Lexapro (5mg) and Xanax. I took it and fell asleep for 14 hours. I took Xanax (0.5mg) all weekend and the task was normal. I started taking Lexapro on a Friday and Tuesday realized could not climax. Frustrating. I stopped. Doctor gave me Paxil (10mg). I took it 3 days and stopped. It is now a week later and still can't climax. Is this normal? Hopefully this side effect will go away. I hope it is not permanent. Once I get rid of all side effects, I will try just the Xanax for the few times I need it and hopefully there will be no side effects on this. I can't believe taking a drug for such a short time frame could do this."

I was diagnosed and treated with Lexapro in 2003. It has changed my life. I was only able to hold down a job for the most three years...mood swings would effect my preformance at work relationships as well as my personal relationships. Lexapro helped me think clearer and with less emotion. My life would have been profoundly different if I had been given Lexapro earlier in my life. I feel calm level headed and never agonize over how I have acted. The only side effects that might be going on is that I am much quieter. I feel my short term memory could be effected as well as a slowed response to recalling information.

After taking this medicine for 1 week I noticed a complete change. I was not irritated by all life's little problems. My mood was much better also. My wife has noticed a great change in my demeanor also and doesn't want me to get off the medicine ever. The only side effect I have noticed was a decrease in libido. I have a difficult time reaching orgasm during sex and my sex drive seems to be way down, which my wife is enjoying. Overall, this has been a wonderful drug that has helped me cope with my job and life again. The side effects were worth the peace of mind I have now.

After my hip rebroke from the original battery in my middle years I became non-functioning. I have taken Wellbutrin, which killed my sex drive and made my heart pound. Prozac made me loopy. Wellbutrin began to help within days with a 10 mg dose. I now sustain on 30, and have a GOOD life! While I ended up partially handicapped from a botched hip replacement. my attitude is very good, I am happy and cheerful, and enjoy everything. I did not gain weight. It does make me sleepy and not quite as alert, but I take that over panicking any day. I am kind and play with my children, able to deliniate issues FAR more quickly instead of being floored by them and take a plan of action. My short term memory has taken a hit, so I work on that. I am 49 and a mother of 4, including a toddler. I can remain calm when things get stressful, and as a result can move myself into a healthier place mentally or physically if need be. I can quell the panic before it begins. If someone needs IMMEDIATE results, I recommend this med highly. I could work again, and enjoy life. Sex is affected some, but again - it's way better than panic attacks, and I can rein in my thoughts and feelings so that I don't over=react.

Told me it would be about 5-7 days to get the full benefits from Lexapro and my wife would probably notice its effects first. That was incorrect, after about 3 days my mood greatly lightened up, no detrimental side effects noticed.

ever since puberty, i became increasingly introverted, depressed and frustrated. because of my deep introversion and ambiguity to work friends and family i began to slip away from the world and i totally shut off. 
after being fed up with depression i got my parents to take me to my Dr. at first i was put on buspar which only exacerbated my depression. after 2 months of that, he put me on this miracle drug.
i have never felt better in my life. i am regaining all of my friends, i am regaining all of my confidence and most importantly my family.
lexapro saved my life."

No more anxiety or panic attacks and I sleep very well. I feel very calm. In the beginning I yawned a lot, felt tired,and had zero ability to have an orgasim. But after the first month I no longer have these side effects. It does take more effort to have an orgasim but it's worth it to have the peace in my life. I highly recommend this medicine

I am a firm believer in prayer and natural remedy's, but as the year's passed the depression worsened, so I contiued to seek help. I was told so many times, ""There is nothing wrong with you"".  I finally was diagnosed and started on Lexapro 10mg. It took 3 to 4 weeks before my depression started to subside. I have tried to go off of it on my own, and the emotional roller coaster would start again. I have my life back, and I am very greatful and thankful.

While I was on these types of meds; Like most Depression Meds. You should slowly come off of this med as it effects the chemical levels in the brain. This is probably the reason you are feeling the way you do. Each person is different and has different feelings of w/drwls. Talk with your Doctor."

After being on the drug for 8 months with no results, it took over 5 months to get off the stuff. It caused major veritgo when I would go without a dose. This made it really hard when I was trying to stop taking it. I had to gradually step down but the vertigo didn't stop until 3 weeks after my final dose.

I am not really a depressed person, just anxious, so I can't say if it does anything for depression or not. I will say that it caused me to have depression because of the side effects. I gained 40 lbs in less than 3 months, I lost all my sex drive and ability to climax and I was always tired....all the time. Not just sleepy, but exhausted feeling. 

I went off the Lexapro and it took nearly a year for my sex drive to return and it has returned, but not to what it was before I took it. I still have not been able to lose the weight even though I exercise an hour a day and jog 5 miles a day. It just will not come off and I do not eat that much. My shrink says it changed the make up of my motabolism and I may not get it back again. Great! I have gotten energy back again. I am not tired anymore and I require only about 5 hours of sleep a night now and I feel fine. One really good thing for me was that Lexapro had no ill effects coming off of it. I just weened myself off by taking a pill every other day, then one every few days then one a week and then none. I could not even tell a difference at all. 

I am on no medication now. I had gone on the generic brand of Wellbutrin and that was a horror story. Worse drug ever. So I am winging it alone now and doing fine. I do keep Xanax on hand in case of emergencies, but so far so good.

All in all, Lexapro is probably a good drug for a lot of people, just be aware that you may gain weight, you may experience loss of libido and you may feel tired all the time. But that was just what happen to me and we are all different."

The pain felt like someone was ringing out a towel (but my stomach was the towel). It would hurt for about 5-15 seconds, then it would completely stop for 10-15 minutes. Made worse by eating.

I've never felt anything like this before.

Felt ok most of the time over the first few months but it's been hell ever since. Constant feeling of being on edge, severe anxiety, brain fog, tremors 24/7, mood swings, zaps, fatigue, irritability, the works. Tried to taper off this summer but went way too quickly. The month I was off was like something I've never experienced in my life. Never before contemplated suicide before this drug experience. Unbearable anxiety and depressive spells came harder than ever. Felt absolutely poisened. Went back on 10mg and am currently taking a break from weaning which I plan on doing over a long period of time. 

This drug has at times totally stolen everything I ever knew about myself away from me. No emotion, no sense of humor, no personality. Absolutely hell. 

These drugs should only be used as a last resort, and even then, it's sketchy. There are FAAAAAAAR better ways to combat anxiety and depression that are side effect free and actually cure the problems. These drugs only mask, and they are handed out like candy.

Reconsider your approach to these pills guys! You're not solving anything and you're setting yourself for hell down the road. Societies ""pill popping"" approach to treating has to stop, because not only is it bankrupting this country, it's putting thousands and thousands of people through hell."

I went from 10mg to 15mg with 150mg of Wellbutrin - Lex makes me sleepy (I could sleep for 17 hrs at a time AND go back to bed an hr later & sleep for another 17hrs no problem!) so my Doc put me on the Wellbutrin which has counteracted the sleepiness. My sex drive is almost entirely gone, I have severe hoarseness but that is it - I haven't gained any weight - I also can't have even a sip of alcohol - beer, wine, vodka - nothing at all w/o throwing up. After not knowing what was wrong for almost half my life the almost total loss of my sex drive is a very small price to pay for happiness. I would recommend.

I turn out the light at 11:00 at lay awake until 1 or 2 - which is a distraction at work.  also have night sweats but that could be due to menopause.  I would recomment Lexapro above Zoloft and Paxil but i'm really not certain that it is helping be that much.  I feel okay - but still have anxiety at the thought of traveling, vacations or doing anything out of my routine.  I'm still not thrilled over anything in life and don't have any great highs - but no great lows either.  All and all - i don't know what i think.  I know before taking Lexapro i decided that once i started, i would not stop.  The withdrawls from Paxil and Zoloft were both very debilitating and i'm afraid to go through that again.   I will stay with Lexapro - and hope i continue to do better and feel more interested and excited about life.  Good luck to you too.

A couple of triggers later I spiraled into a major I DONT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING depression.  I felt I would rather die than deal with the holidays and my birthday.

I have been on it for 3 years due to anxiety disorder.  I didn't gain any weight from it and I went off of it with no side effects when I got pregnant.  I used to have a nervous tick in my right eye when I spoke to people I didn't know.  That was gone within a month. I don't get antsy and fidgety anymore and I can relax in a crowd. My subconscious yelling at me for what I did 10 years ago finally subsided. I was borderline anti-social.  I love this medication it has change my life for the best and I don't ever plan on going off of it unless my insurance makes me. My insurance would not cover this drug for about 6 months and I went off and changed to Zoloft and another drug that were totally ineffective. That time I had no real side effects either that I could blame on Lexapro.

I have what has only recently been categorized as Bipolar Depression. I am bipolar but my main symptoms are depression. I have brief bouts of mania but overall am mostly depressed. This medicine works rather well for the depression; however, my mania/rage is not very well contained. I have made diet/behavoiral/lifestyle changes to compensate for this and my life is now pretty well balanced. It does take some time before you are adjusted and see satisfactory results(6 months-1 year). After so many years on it, I am noticing that I have gotten ""ditzy"" and forgetful, but that is still better than constant suicide attempts and crying nonstop. I was an extremely detailed and almost ocd person before and now my standards of organization and scheduling are more lax. Still, better than the alternatives..."

He works with a doctor who treats women for breast cancer and she says the first thing patients do when they come into her office is to throw away their Premarin or any and all female hormones and start on Lexapro for their menopausal symptoms.  She says, ""female hormomes cause breast cancer"".  I tried 10 mg first and felt this was too much.  My doctor said, ""half it"" so I did and I am one happy camper.  I was flashing all day long before.   I mentioned this to my OB/GYN doc the other day and I could tell he thinks this is for depression but when I tried to explain, he cut me off.  So sad for those taking cancer causing female hormones because this is the greatest remedy for hot flashes that ever came down the pike!  Spread the word, save your girlfriends!"

The first week  I had pretty severe headaches, trouble sleeping, dry mouth and a 'loopy' feeling. A colleague of mine, who was also on this medication, told me to hang in. I listened and am now feeling  great. Lexipro has  taken the edge off. It has not changed my basic personality but I feel better able to cope and deal with tough situations. I have a significant family history of depression. My father committed suicide and my grandfather suffered from what they called back in the day a nervous breakdown. I was resistant in the past to taking medication but when I was hit recently with depression where all I wanted to do was sleep and had to drag myself to work, I knew I couldn't just snap out of it. So far so good.

We had tried Celexa and Prozac before this. I had no beginning side-effects with this medication and for the last two years it had helped calm me down and it helped greatly reduce my levels of anxiety, which were through the roof before I started taking medication. The only two things I hate about this medication are these: One, it is ridiculously expensive. $90.00 for a months supply. And two, I have been severely affected by the side-affect known as Anorgasma. I have had no interest in sex while I have been on this medication. It has  helped calm me down, but it has also calmed everything else, which is not something I can live with for the rest of my life. Especially since my husband and I have only been married for 1 1/2 years.  "

I have seen therapists and been on a couple medicines that made me sleepy when I was younger. I have also had a problem with concentration & mild depression. Recently I have had a string of really stressful situations come up and anxiety, panic,& depression combined with OCD & ADD & really bad mood swings (screaming, breaking & throwing anything I could get my hands on).  I was ready for something! I didn't feel like I needed to see a therapist, I kinda know whats wrong with me, so I saw a doctor that deals with depression & ADD/OCD. I just wanted try something! She explained that while medicine doesn't change who you are it changes how you react to things. I am on Lexapro 20 mg and the only side effect seems to be I wake up in the middle of the night dripping in sweat! I am generally happier, calmer, relaxed, donn't let the small things bother me. I have had a few bouts of depression here and there but it goes away & its nothing I'd consider abnormal. I can finally & my OCD is alot calmer. My advice to anyone just starting on it is the first week,you feel like your flying! I loved it, but some may have a stronger reaction, just give it some time and it should level out.

I was given a 4 week supply sample originally to help me with a sleeping problem (as the doctor had asked if i also felt anxiety or depression). In that time, my depression had diminished (and i had EXTREMELY difficult family situations that started 2 weeks after i took it...great timing...I would have been completely depressed and beside myself, but I felt great.)

I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, overweight/obesity, cholesterol issues) a few months earlier. Lexapro lowered my high blood pressure to a perfect score, acted as an appetite suppressant, and i lost weight because of it. 

obviously this wont be the case with everyone. the only side effects i experienced were moderate nausea and occasional headaches when first incorporating the drug into my system (first week or two).

I've had varying levels of depression since i was 13. I'm now going on 22 so i still have a while to go. i was off it for 2 months and i just bought my first prescription for it. 2nd day: nausea and headache. hopefully it will just go away like it did before."

Lexapro has saved my life. I was prescribed the drug for severe anxiety and mild depression. The first time I was on it, I took it for about 3 months in the morning and I had the sexual side effects, loss of libido and I could not have an orgasm to save my life!! I stopped taking it because I could not handle the sexual side effects. Then when my doctor prescribed it again he told me that it should ALWAYS be taken at night!!! It helps with the drowsiness, which was my 1st problem because I felt like a zombie in the morning when I took it. So when I started taking it at night, I noticed that I STARTED TO HAVE ORGASMS RIGHT AWAY!! Now I take it before bed every night, and I have orgasms all the time! I want everyone to know to talk to your doctor about taking Lexapro at night!! The side effects are non-existent! It saved my life, TAKE IT AT NIGHT!!

I went to see a therapist and my PCP for help because I was really scared for my mental health.  I felt like I was loosing my mind. Lexapro has been a miracle for me. I'm no longer angry all the time, I don't have days where I feel like doing nothing but crying or feel like I'm completely empty and it's a struggle to even get out of bed.  I haven't had any suicide thoughts since about the fifth week of being on it.  My mind is a lot more active but it's with positive thoughts instead of angry & sad ones. I feel normal and truly happy for the first time in my life.  Thank goodness for Lexapro.

I'm a person who never takes medication but found myself severely depressed after the death of my mother and needed something to bring me out of the black cloud I found myself in. I was first prescribed Wellbutrin and Effexor both increased my heart rate and blood pressure. I guess third times a charm because Lexapro worked great it was like someone turned a light switch on in my head, I noticed a change within the first week of taking this medicine. I now think more clearly, I have more energy, I don't get upset over the little things, my anger and mood has mellowed out, Co-workers have even commented that I'm friendlier now.
I find that lexapro works better for me when I take it around the same time every day after I've eaten usually around 9:30am after breakfast. Lexapro will make you nauseated if you do not eat before taking. But as for not sleeping or gaining weight as mentioned in other reviews I have actually lost weight because I do more in the day, I don't go home and just sit on the couch any more after work. This is the benefit of taking this medicine early in the morning I accomplish more during the day and when I go to bed I'm naturally tired and fall asleep. I don't plan on being on this medicine for very long but it is working for me when I'm needing it the most."

I tried Lexapro samples for four weeks and while it was effective in the beginning, I became more depressed to the point of crying and sleeping during the day which I never did before.  I immediately got off the drug and feel pretty much OK now.  I believe that I had a Serotonin Storm which is a common problem with taking these types of drugs.  If at all possible, when suffering from clinical depression, try other non-perscription alternatives first.  Try to get more active, exercise more and seek mental support from a mental health professional. Major depression may require this and other drugs for depression

Lexapro has worked very effectively but I've had side effects which have caused me to stop the drug twice. On Lexapro mood is very even with feelings  of just not being bothered about anything - this ""lack"" of emotion means sadness/anxiety is gone but I sometimes missed ""feeling"" things. Also found it difficult to motivate myself for work as the stress went.Worst side effect for me was weight gain (20-30lbs)- I probably started eating more but didn't really notice at the time. For me Lexapro becomes effective within a few days and the two times I've stopped sad and anxious feelings have come back within a few weeks. The drug has been most effective and if it wasn't for the weight gain I'd probably still be taking it."

You need to read over ALL the reviews and rule out a few that don't seem to jive with all the others.  There's always a few out there who are dissatisfied. That doesn't mean those same things will happen to you.  Do your research and remember, everyone is different and react to drugs differently.  

Don't be scared the first time you see a reviewer mention weight gain or decreased libido.  It's more important that you get to feeling better and you can deal with those things later. 

I've had depression for 30 years and Prozac 20mg worked for me up until I hit 50. Perhaps it was because I'm pre-menopausal or because I'd taken the same drug, at the same dose for so many years.  I went to the doctor and tried several other drugs. At first, I wasn't satisfied with any of them, so I got on Effexor XR.  Wow!  Please read about the withdrawl symptoms when going off of Effexor, because they are severe. Try all the other meds first. Something will work for you.

Bottom line, I'm going back on Lexapro.  I don't think I gave it enough of a chance and it was working pretty well for me. Be patient and don't try to change meds or get off of something without a doctor's advice.  Been there, done that, and it was terrible.  I believe that Lexapro is a wonderful drug. It is sure the best I've tried so far. I believe our bodies get used to something and it finally stops working. That's what happened to me with Prozac, although it was my wonder drug for 20+ years. I'm going to ask my doctor if perhaps I should rotate between Lexapro and Prozac every few years. That may be the answer for me.

DON'T GIVE UP. Antidepressants will help you get your life back, but you have to be patient. Also exercise, eat right, and talk to someone who cares. God bless you all and best wishes in your recovery.

There is light at the end of the tunnel, I promise.

I had been taking 20 Mg for almost 1 1/2 years and it worked great. Sex drive tanks but not as much as with other meds of this type. Very difficult to get an erection and very delayed orgasm (which helped in some cases). I stopped taking lexapro one week ago and just yesterday experienced light-headedness and dizziness after walking up stairs. I also experienced it this morning, which caused me to check out this site. This never occurred while on Lexapro- could be withdrawal symptom as I am finding out now. I am tired of the sexual side effect of decreased drive, orgasm, and erection. Otherwise this is a great med.

Then you mellow out. Helped me level out my moods. My endurance went down. Stopped running and became more thoughtful. In fact it helped me think more even. The arguements with myself ended. Yes, I was probably a little psycho when I started. I was just fired from my job and it was done by people who were malicious about it. Basically, Lexapro calmed me down and I'm getting on with my life. After extensive consultation with your doctor and therapist I would recommend trying it for three months.

I took it every day, in the morning, and after a few weeks I started feeling less irritable, angry, frustrated and upset; but I still didn't feel better. I felt less like me, and more like a shell of what I was. Instead of making me feel better, it made me feel nothing, which was depressing in itself, only I was incapable of feeling depressed. The drug worked, don't get me wrong, it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I just didn't like how it made me feel, I lost who I was and was happy to switch prescriptions.

I got a little nauseous as I increased the dosage.  I'm now taking 40mg in the morning and have been on this dosage for about 3 months.  Sexual sides lasted a few weeks.  Now sex is even better than before.  Complete control.  The reason I only gave it a 3 in effectiveness is that I still have intrusive thoughts that can bother me sometimes for a few days, before it was weeks.  I was able to quit checking my car/apt/and hand washing most of the time.  and i rarely apologize unless I am truely wrong. I still battle with fear of obsessing about a bad obsession.  lol.  but its never really that bad!!  The spike doesn't make me miserable.  Some of the other SSRI's gave me a burning sensation in my body/neck/shoulder. Lexapro gave me a milder burning sensation for the first week at 5mg.  I took it at night to cope.  After it got in my system the burning sensation went away.  This took about a week and was well worth it.  I feel it is a much cleaner SSRI.  I do eat healthy and work out a few times a week.  I also do CBT with my shrink every few weeks.  I was literally living in fear 80 percent of the day before Lexapro. Now i would say its around 20-30 percent.  I can concentrate and enjoy relationships again.  Sleep is better too!  I do find it makes me a little tired some days and manic others, but nothing extreme. Give lex a try if you are sensitive to other SSRI's.

I was VERY anxious for the first few weeks, probably more so than why I even got on it.  My pdoc wanted me to take ativan 2-3 times daily to get thru the early period of adjusting to this med, and I am really glad I weathered the storm.  I am more level headed, can handle the day-to-day more easily, do not jump the gun and start yelling at people for no reason, and no longer suffer from random anxiety attacks on a daily basis.  My PMS is almost non-existent, whereas before my husband would take cover for 7-10 days before my period.  I truly would have headed for the hills far away from this med had my doctor not warned me about the start-up side effects.  Some people may not have them, but if you are like me and notice EVERY LITTLE THING that changes in you body and mind, you may be more sensitive to these types of meds and it may just freak you out.  Nothing a little scheduled ativan can't handle.  Thankfully my doc trusted me to take this, as I know other docs won't prescribe it for their patients.  I don't know how else I would have made it through the first 2-3 weeks.  Now I almost never have to take the ativan, because when I do get anxiety it is mild and I can talk myself off the edge of insanity pretty easily unlike before when I would just freak out immediately.  I do have a decreased libido but Lexapro comes with a built-in ""I don't give a crap"" mentality for so many things, including your reaction to the minor side effects you may have to live with.  And it's not ""I don't care I'm a zombie"" it's ""I'm not going to take that too seriously"".  BTW I only take 7.5 mg because 10 mg made my muscles twitch for some reason, but it seems to still work great.  Good luck!"

When I switched to 10 mg I was fine all day a little hyper(I take it in the morning) but at night I woke up having a panic attack and tremors. I immediately went back to 5 mg. Another side effect I had was a terrible menstrual cycle. I bled heavily with large clots.. not sure if that is related to the medication or not. Don't think this is worth taking due to the side effects. But everyone's different.

The combination has kept me on this side of the asylum walls, and I'm grateful.  The depression was bad, but the manic rage was unbearable, both for me and those around me.  The support of an excellent therapist, a fantastic circle of friends, the most supportive family one could have, and being blessed with the kindest and most loving husband the Deity ever put on this earth are also reasons I'm certifiable yet still at large.  :-)

1712$Condition: Depression$11/13/2009 12:34:55 PM$Reviewer: Kaykev, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$I noticed a huge difference right away.  I was feeling more calm and able to handle things.  However, I started having the sexual side effects so I talked to my doctor.  He cut the dose in half and that took care of that problem.  Then I started having severe nausea and dizziness where I felt like the room was spinning.  It would last for about 4 hours every day.  After a few weeks I just couldn't take it anymore.  So I talked to my doctor again and changed meds completely.  I did not gain any weight on Lexapro but I wasn't able to lose any, either even when working out and cutting calories.  While Lexapro helped my depression/anxiety, the side effects were just not worth it.  For those of you having side effects be sure to talk to the doctor.  It may just be a matter of changing the dosage.

I didn't want to take any meds at all, I never have before.  But I was at the point where I couldn't function anymore; I could barely take care of my kids.  I was scared to start any anti-depressant b/c my sister had a bad reaction to one.  This one has been great, but now the positive changes are fizzling out.  My doctor and I may need to play with the dose.  When I take too much, I feel a little manic. But now I'm holding at 10 mg, and while I can get through the day without crying, I'm still sad and lack energy.  Overall I DO recommend this drug.  I've had very few bad side effects.

I never wanted to be one of those 'statistics'. I didnt want to be on medication every day. But i also couldnt live with the constant (what I call) heart dropping feeling. It was taking over my life. The first few weeks def. took some getting used to. But after being on Lexapro for over 4 months I feel like my old self (which has been soo long since i've seen).

The side effects were so extreme I couldn't even make it in to work today. How odd I've been counting down the minutes until the Lexapro gets out of my system and I can go back to my old, normal nervous wreck. Took dose one last night with dinner. Within an hour felt drugged and nauseous. Fell into a coma-like sleep for about 4 hours and woke up around 7am. Layed in bed in a for a while before I realized the side effects. Heart racing in my chest like it was about to burst, hot and sweaty. Got up out of bed to test the waters and the dizzyness and trembling hands began to set in. Basically it took my anxiety attacks, turned them up to full volume and added a myriad of other side effects. And I could feel the numb, zombielike state blanketing it all. No thanks. This drug made me realize I need to master this disorder through more natural methods. Today scared the shit out of me. I assume a lot of people posting here are young and in school by saying they sleep all day or take 3 naps a day. I have to work full time and couldn't do it taking this drug judging how I felt today.

I have trouble sleeping anyway and so this isn't helping me at all.  I woke up very confused after sleeping only about an hour.  Not very happy with this medication at all.  Will be talking to my doctor in the morning.
1720$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$11/9/2009 5:05:55 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$4$"When I started taking Lexipro, it was like night and day.  I was diagnosed with MDD when I was 10, and have struggled to find treatment that would work ever since.  The first day I took Lexipro, I felt like getting out and socalizing, something that has never happened to me before.  People around me noticed a difference (my grandpa commented that I had more sparkle).  The downside is if I don't take my pill at the same time every day, I get diarrhea.  I also have trouble sleeping, and as a result am tired all the time. Lexipro also does not manage my anxiety as well as my previous medication, and I have had a sharp increase in panic attacks. 

Overall, though, Lexipro does such a good job managing my mood, I'm willing to over-look the side effects (which do seem to be getting better as time goes on.)"

I haven't been able to work out of the home for the last 3 years because of my depression/anxiety/add/pmdd) so was able to take the time to adjust. The 1st couple of days I thought I was losing my mind. I'd be crying for ten minutes, then extremely agitated for ten, then ok for ten - press repeat.  Essentially, 1st two weeks didn't feel at all like myself & had severe nausea, sleep problems, you name it including suicidal thoughts (try not to be alone, although I had to). But after having tried no kidding EVERY other drug out there just about with no luck, I was desperate & hung in there, just hoping. 2-3 months into taking 10mg I WAS noticing some improvement but not enough with my anxiety, so my doctor upped me to 20mg. So I had a repeat of the two weeks of hell - after a couple of weeks it was bearable but still wasn't myself for a couple more. Now, while I do still have to fight the depression, at least I feel I can. I can actually usually choose my reactions to stress instead of my reactions choosing me, have spent more time out of bed and actually able to function when my PMDD isn't kicking my butt ten days a month around my period (any suggestions for this?), & have been able to cope MUCH better. BTW, just some of the other drugs I tried (and yes, did give them at least a month or two - didn't have the severe side effects as with the Lexapro, just zombied out): Paxil (never again!), Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor ... there were more I can't remember off-hand, including ones for anxiety/panic attacks.  It had gotten to where I didn't believe in the meds at all before trying the Lex.  Now I wish I'd hung in there before & kept trying until I found one that worked for me. Could have maybe saved me years of grief and a messed-up life. Anyway, REALLY grateful for this drug! Hang in there all & keep trying!

Although, my severe mood swings and anxiety had all but vanished, I was very unhappy with the weight gain. After almost a year of taking the drug, I wanted off. I quit taking it on my own. The first day was okay. The second day was a nightmare. I got a painful cramp in my upper back and arm. It felt like what I thought a heart attack might feel like, and then the shocks or the buzz. I had moments of staring and not being able to break my gaze. I was lucky I didn't throw them away. I started taking them again and all the withdrawal episodes went away. I had to have medical guidance from my Internal Medicine Doctor to get off the med. After all that, I still think using the Lexapro was worth it, because it did help me. I just couldn't live with the weight gain. I guess I would rather be moody and anxiety ridden then overweight.

For the first few weeks there was little positive about the medicine. I was very nauseated and had severe headaches. I talked to my doctor and he told me to keep at it. I did and got over the symptoms within a few weeks. After that I quickly noticed positive changes. However, I have gained over 20lbs and have a very tired feeling throughoit the day. Rarely do I have trouble sleeping. When I do not take my medicine for a few days, I become much more irritable and in a bad mood. I also feel quite nauseated, dizzy and these zap like pulses through my body that arent necessarily painful but uncomfortable and dissorienting. My Dad passed away a few months after i started taking this medication and that was quite a test. I felt like I was in control of myself and able to still properly grieve.  Overall, I am quite happy with the results thus far and it is important to keep with it and take it as prescribed.

I feel like I enjoy life again without stressing so much. I began taking Lexapro due to my father dying, then my cousin and then my husband being deployed all within a few months. It has helped me calm down and cope with life, rather than being so angry.

I found it to have little side-effects, but the two most bothersome to me were tinnitus and weight gain.  I gained 20 lbs in 2 yrs.  It really helped with both depression and anxiety.  It helped with focusing and concentration.  I am now trying to slowly decrease my dosage and gradually get off the drug.  However, I have found this to be difficult due to increasing tinnitus and sleepiness.  I would use this drug again for depression and anxiety.

Some symptoms have become worse and there is a corrolation to daily function & how severe symptoms may be on a given day.  Even with CBT (long-term) my overhwelming sadness is a prevailing, predominant symptom.  The fatigue, lack of interest, etc., I truly try to ""manage"" by just dealing with it trying to move on. Day-by-day, just attempting to get out of ""myself"" more & into the world & change the focus from my feelings to attempting to contribute to the world & others, as I can, day by day.

I absolutely hate Lexapro. I feel disconnected from the world, and have no emotions at all. The burning sensation associated with panic attacks has disappeared, but I still have great anxiety all the time. I feel worse than I did before I started. I feel depressed and don't care about anything, which I didn't feel before taking Lexapro. I also have headaches all the time and feel tired way more than I used to. I have strange and unpleasant dreams almost every night. It's negatively affecting my relationship with my boyfriend and my family. I understand this has worked wonders for some people, but it is definitely not the drug for me. I hope to get off of it soon.

I would recommend talking to your doctor about taking the lowest dose possible. 10mg & 5mg made me sleepy. 2.5mg worked well so did 1.25mg (cut 5mg pill in 1/4).
Absolute WORST part about this medication is when you stop taking it you will get horrible 'brain zaps'. They are not painful per-say but it is like your brain being electrocuted with the slightest stimuli (light, noise, moving your eyes, turning your head, etc.) Tapering-off lessens the severity of the 'brain zaps' but they will still occur.  I've been off for approx 1yr and will still get these 'brain zaps' once in a while if its really quiet, dark, and I'm tired.
With my husband deploying I've started to take them again but only 1.25mg, just enough to dull the extreme emotions without making me spacey."

None of the previous worked as immediately or as well for me as Lexapro. (My advice: DO NOT JUDGE THIS OR ANY MEDICINE BY SIDE EFFECTS IN FIRST FEW DAYS. If I had stopped any of these medicines based on first couple of days, I would never have taken any anti-depressants and life would not be good. Or really, I might not be here anymore.) BACK TO SUBJECT: On Lexapro, my anxiety was improved, as well as my depression. I used 10 mg for about a year, then upped to 20 mg when it seemed necessary. I will say that I have been more sleepy, less energetic and have an increased appetite (translation: I gained 30 lbs. and I am a skinny person). I also have had increased problems with memory and concentration, and have trouble finding words when I am speaking. I am not sure whether the focus/memory is due to the Lexapro or not. But it doesn't help those areas, so I added Wellbutrin to the Lexapro for a time in order to see if focus/appetite/energy could be improved. I may still do that again at some point. My dr. said that using an SSRI for a long time can lead to less dopamine, which you need for concentration, energy and other things. For now, I am switching to a drug that acts on more than one neurotransmitter (norepinephrine and serotinin) just like the combo of Wellbutrin and Lexapro to see if that helps with fatigue, focus and memory. But I would not change a thing about my experience with Lexapro. It was the right drug for me at the time. If you are anxious and depressed, it is an especially good option. Realize that you may have to revisit whether it's the best option from time to time.

The side effects at first were hard - stomach upset, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. After a few weeks it went away and my body adjusted. Best of all it helped me gain weight finally. Stress in my life the past few years made it impossible for me to want to eat or anything or gain weight. 

I am not sure what is normal bc everyone's bodies are different and will react to every drug different, but lately I have felt a bit more agitated more than usual since I started taking Lexapro. The doctor recommended me going up to 15mg but I am hesitant.

It helped me in a very profound way. I have not had a panic attack or any real anxiety related issues since about a week after starting. I expirenced very few side effects. Mainly just drowsiness (granted it was pretty difficult to stay away) for the first two weeks. I was on the fence about taking an SSRI but I am very glad that I did. I have suggested this medication to a friend of mine and they are having positive feelings about it too. My only real worry about Lexapro is I may be ""mentally"" addicted to it. I don't know if that is possible, but I do worry about how I will do if I ever do stop taking it."

I've been on lexapro for just over 1 yr.  It has certainly ""evened me out"" and I feel that I deal w/ stressful situations on a much more even kiel, but I am tired ALL THE TIME and still have an ""I don't give a crap"" attitude.  I could sleep everyday, all day if I didn't have to work.  I take naps whenever I can.  I definitely have to really pep talk myself to get out of bed everyday.  I'm not nearly as motivated as I used to be to get things done and I have trouble really focusing on things since taking lexapro.  I'm also constantly yawning and have gained at least 15 lbs.  I've also noticed that I have difficulty finding words when I'm talking to people, which never happened prior to taking this drug.  So, I decided to take myself off of it since I'm tired of being tired.  I guess it's withdrawl, but in the few days after I stopped taking it, I get these weird sensations in my head, like shocks or zaps and I find it hard for my eyes to focus when this occurs.  Also, my ears are ringing non-stop.  I really don't want to take this drug anymore, but am affraid the withdrawls are only going to get worse."

It started with St. John's Wart from just about birth, Prozac at 11, and then I went through Valium, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and probably a few others that I don't remember. With the exception of the Prozac, everything seemed to work for a time but then I would need to up the dosage or combine it with another drug. It always felt so ridiculous to watch the commercials for whatever I was taking and hear them say that, because I was under 18, I shouldn't be taking it. Lexapro has been great so far, though as I said everything worked in the beginning. I haven't had any noticeable side effects and though getting my insurance to pay for it has been hell I hope to continue seeing the same improvement in my mood.

The drug has worked tremendously to keep my anxiety under control.  However last week I started a new job for the first time in 28 years and my anxiety returned with a vengeance.  Lexapro is more of a preventitive medication and it did not control my increased anxiety because of the new job.  My doctor prescribed .5mg of Xanax to try and get the anxiety under control.  The Xanax seems to be working however my concern now is if the anxiety will continue to return when starting a new job.  I had to be let go from this recent new job because if was a computer programmin contractor's job and the client did not want to have to deal with my anxiety issues.  So now I will again be looking for a new job and my fear is that the anxiety will return in spite of now taking Xanax.  Has anyone out there experienced this same situation?

I'm a professional who has been able to ""hide"" my depression.  within 2 weeks, the suicidal thoughts almost disappeared, I was able to laugh, and didn't have the severe mood swings I have in the evening.  I have become a little ""lazy"" though.  I miss the anxiety that often motivates me to accommplish tasks.  Minimal weight gain which I've managed to control by giving up junk food.

As regards weight gain:  The Lexapro, in and of itself, does NOT cause weight gain.  It can, however, increase your appetite, and it lowers your basic resistance, so where once you might have said ""no""... you may very well say ""yes"".

I have not experienced a problem with weight gain from what I can tell, but I am pretty active, so maybe that counter acts it. I would recommend this product to a friend/family member in fact...I have.

I could not function afterwards but had to because I have a young daughter.  It worked great for the first 8 months, it relieved my anxiety, I was able to get through my day.  Around month 9 my appetite increased tremendously, I could not get myself away from the kitchen so I gained about 10 pounds which for my small frame is bad.  I immediately stopped taking it and my appetite returned to normal and I did loose some of the weight.  Also I noticed it was no longer doing anything to help, my system was used to it.  So moral of the story, good for short time use not for long term, at lease not for me.

I feel that it evens me out and I no longer worry about the small stuff.  You need to give this medicine at least 6 weeks to give your body time to adjust.  I felt a little weird at first.  I experienced several side effects the first month (mainly waking up in the middle of the night with a rapid heart rate), but it gradually became less frequent & disappeared.  It also makes you a little tired at times if you cut your sleep short.  If I get a good 7-8 hours of sleep each night, I feel energized most days.  I resisted the urge to stop taking this medicine during the first month with the support of my wife and lots of prayers and the payoff was well worthwhile to me.  I am very glad I stuck with it through the initial body adjustment, though it was tough at times.  I finally feel like my normal self again.

I've been taking Lexapro for over 4 years now, I originally started at 10mg, once per day, I shortened my dose to half a pill every other day due to severe anger problems while taking this medication. I can say it definitely helps with depression, however for me it was very ineffective at helping with OCD issues -- I still have my routines, merely in spurts now.
I do not recommend this medication to anyone unless all other medications for lighter symptoms fail. This drug is very powerful and should not be taken simply because you had a bad day at work, etc. I can vouch for anger issues associated with taking this medication daily, as well as bi-polar behavior and loss of mental focus, lack of feeling real/alive mentally & visually, etc.
I've tried kicking this medication and it is not difficult to get off of, very few withdrawals -- however I suggest cutting the dose gradually rather than going cold turkey.
This medication does not seem to conflict with Propranolol.
Side effects I have experienced are dry mouth, constipation, jittery eyes and erection problems but they are tolerable in comparison to depression.
It is also very expensive, at least $90 without insurance.
If you're on this medication, make sure it works for you and you feel it helps, otherwise find one that actually helps you and do not force yourself to adapt mentally to it."

1939$Condition: Depression$8/20/2009 11:09:31 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$"I was prescribed Lexapro to treat my depression, and was only on the drug for one week. During that week, my energy level dropped significantly, I could barely stay awake throughout the day and my brain was in a complete fog. I was spaced out and loopy and felt exhausted. It didn't matter whether I took it in the morning or at night, with our without food, the results were the same. I could barely function through a work day, and I probably shouldn't have been driving a car in this state. I didn't cry or feel depressed during the week, but I can't say that I felt much of anything, except strange. I have been off it for 24 hours now, and the difference is amazing. I have my energy back, I'm not loopy and I'm not physically exhausted. I can focus on work tasks again. My doctor has prescribed Cymbalta as the next drug for me to try for treating the depression, which I have not started yet.

I read many positive reviews about Lexapro, and I guess the point of me writing this review is so that people can see that in some cases, this drug is clearly not for everyone. And if you are immediately experiencing some of the less common side effects, talk to your doctor immediately."

I would say I am better on lexapro than on other antidepressants I have tried. Dr. then added Strattera 60mg to see if it would increase antidepressant effect of lexapro.  Staterra has helped in off-setting weight gain and shakiness I was experiencing on lexapro.

I tried at least 10 different meds before I found Lexapro and it was the ONLY medicine like this that has ever worked for me and many other people have told me the same thing. Side effects are very minimal, it's funny someone on here said their wrists hurt now-- I've noticed my arm (only when I try to get comfortable going to sleep at night) will NOT relax, it kind of aches... Only my left arm, never the right. I don't know if that has anything to do with the Lexapro but I have never hurt it and it didn't do that before, and it only bothers me for a minute. Otherwise I sleep great at night, I handle situations GREAT, I can prioritize things at work, I stay calm at all times, I don't feel like I did for years-- that feeling that I was just worthless... I actually feel important again, and I like who I am for the first time in many many years. I would definitely recommend it to others with anxiety and depression!

Lexapro has been the last drug of choice for the past 5 years or so. I have tried just about every antidepressant out there and they usually do what my doctor calls the ""poop out syndrume"" on me. Lexapro was fairly easy to trasition over to from my last drug, Prozac. However, I have never taken a medication that has taken me back to the way that I once felt years ago. Lexapro just helps me get by and there are times when it lags, such as when a sickness is coming on. In general, the side effects to this drug have been the same as any other antidepressant...fatigue, sleepiness, worsening of mood, when starting the medication. They went away for me in approximately a month. The one thing that I do like about this medicine is that it is easy to mix with other medications that may be prescribed by my other Doctors. Overall for me, it keeps me going, but still doesn't have the end results that I long to have."

It takes about 3-4 weeks to get over the side effects and my depression is improving daily.

I would suggest this product to anyone who has tried in vain with other nuances.  Usually 10mg is more than enough, you need to give it time. I was told 10mg of Lexapro is equal to 40mg of Celexa. Lexapro is a much better, cleaner solution with far less long-term side effects than other antipsychotics and SSRIs.

For the first two months I was taking 10 mg and found myself to be very lethargic.  The doctor reduced my scrip to half a pill, 5mg a day and soon got my energy back.  Since then 5 mg a day has worked for me. I am 4' 11 at 124 lbs and 35 years old.  I was told I wouldn't gain weight on this script and I find that to be true. I have no other side effects except for what it feels like, muscle spasm. Nothing severe and tollerable vs PMS issues I had.  I am happy to have found something that works for me! But, please be patient and tolerate the first 6 weeks of side effects, I found that to be the norm and subsides as soon as your body adjusts. Coming from my experience of course.

It worked extremely well for the first two years. Then I rapidly gained almost 20 pounds and could barely get out of bed, and I also started feeling depressed for the first time in my life. I don't know what happened--it's like my body just decided to stop tolerating it. I was slowly weened off of it and then went another 2 years without taking anything because this experience was so bad. Now I'm back in therapy due to more anxiety issues but am starting Prozac. Bottom line: everyone's body reacts differently to antidepressants, and this drug was effective for a while. I must admit having negative feelings about it due to a friend's brother that died while on it. If you are concerned about weight gain, try something else. My new doctor says people typically gain at least 5-8 pounds on Lexapro.

2068$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/15/2009 11:12:48 AM$Reviewer: muchhappiernow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I began taking 10mg per day in January 05 and have taken it daily since.  I was astounded at the improvement in my mental state within the first 10-14 days.  I realize now how much anxiety and depression was impacting my life.  I no longer feel 'bedeviled' by negative thoughts, anger, helplessness or other repetitive thoughts which really controlled my ability to function optimally.  During this time I also passed thru menopause; and either that or the lexapro may be to blame for decreased memory (short term) and slight weight gain.  Regardless, the improvement on Lexapro has been significant enough (as noted by my family as well) to be well worth memory loss or wt. gain; if indeed it is to blame.  I should also say the anxiety issues are genetic; my mothers family displaying the same type of behaviors I have personally experienced throughout my adolescence and adult life.  I am now 54 and retired from 32 years full time healthcare management (originally RN).

It didn't help the depression. My Dr raised the dose and it still didn't help. Soon later I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I never had a problem w/ it before and it was before stopping treatment w/ the lexapro so it wasn't just withdrawl. I have known other people as well who had the same side effects which aren't noted on the drug facts. Now after 7 months of no help I am going to have to remain on thyroid medications for the remainder of my life and continue having blood work done every 3 to 4 months to test my thyroid hormone levels thanks to this drug. I was diagnosed 5 years ago with hypothyroidism. As a teenager, to hear I'd have to be on medicine for the rest of my life because of a medication that didn't present all the facts, I was horrified.

I asked my dr to put me on the 20 mg so that i could maintain my great feeling.  After taking the 20 mg for a while, I never got that great feeling back.  I think my body started to get used to it.  I still take it and went back to the 10 mg dosage.  I am not as anxious as I once was, but I have not been able to get back to that great feeling that I had in the beginning.  Overall, I like it.

Then on top of everything I showed symptoms of Insomnia. I now take 100mg Trazidone nightly just to go to sleep. There has to be something better out there.

No side effects at all in my case and only hope it assists others and can make the same difference in their lives as it did in mine.

(Took 10mg daily.) I was having some moderate depression and anxiety associated with worry about kids and parents and getting older and did feel better after a month or two.  Was also working with a therapist.  I might have had some sexual side effects and mild weight gain but it's really hard to know whether those were from the drug or the mental condition.  I went off cold turkey four months later as I was feeling better and didn't have any withdrawal effects.  Was it the meds?  Therapy?  Onset of the cheery spring season?  Bad thoughts just coming and going?  Impossible to say.  Might need to go back on if symptoms return. Would rather just take Xanax as I know that works but can't be on that long term.

I followed my Dr's advice to go cold turkey, and I ended up in the ER with a BP of 190/124 and a horrible crawling sensation all over my body like I had to keep moving and couldn't hold still. I was stuck in the median on the freeway and it was all I could do to drive to the hospital. I threw up all over my car and was sweating profusely.  The only thing that made the symptoms subside was to go back on it.  I had to taper my dose for 2 weeks to get off it.  My Dr. thought I was full of it and didn't believe that I had an adverse reaction to quitting cold turkey. I would strongly advise against that, despite what your Dr. might tell you. "

I couldn't sleep but when I did, I never could make myself get up and around the next day. I would cry at the drop of a hat and my moods were insane. My doctor tried me on Celexa, which was the worst drug ever for me. I never had a problem with anxiety until I started that drug && once I did, it just added to my problem. She then decided to start me on Lexapro 10mg and I've been on it for a little over a month and I think it is amazing. I can deal with things so much easier than I used to, my whole outlook on everything is just so much better.

Lexapro has been know to unmask bipolar that would otherwise remain hidden. I was prescribed Lexapro 10MG after a move to a new city and promotion. At first it was great and I felt better than I every had before I started on the medication. After 3 or 4 months, I started to feel too good and started displaying signs of hypomania (high part of bipolar). This effected every relationship, both personal and professional in my life, but I didn't care at the time and I stayed on the medication. After I realized that Lexapro had uncovered a hidden hypomania activity, I weened off of it, taking 5MG a day for two weeks then 5MG everyother day. After I was off Lexapro for a month, I returned to major depression that was way worse than the original episode. The good feelings associated with Lexapro are artifical and it commonly will ""unmask"" bipolar activities. I was never aware of this risk and no doctor talked about it untill it was too late. Use with caution, Lexapro had large negative long term effects in my life."

It was the longest period I've had without a major depressive episode. 3 months ago I decided to go off it and see how i did. Unfortunately I did it on my own, with working with my doc, and went off cold turkey. Several weeks later I had a major crash and have been in a depression ever since. I went right back on the lexapro, but unfortunately it no longer works for my depression, even at a higher dose. I had heard that a small percentage of people experience this when going off and back on an anti depressant. So, now I'm going to try a different AD, pristiq and see how that goes.

My moods are much more stable now also. I am down to taking 5 mg every other day and I think its the perfect dose for me. But if I miss that dose, I get a terrible headache. Negatives- strange dreams, 15 lb weight gain that might have been due to my previous depression. I noticed that when I was taking Lexapro everyday, my resting heart rate was in the 40's!

So I weaned myself off, but the blues came back so back to the doctor to get on something else, which I am now on Effexor XR.  She did say something that I thought to be unprofessional which was ""Our grandmothers didn't seem to be having all these problems and just shook it off"".  I'm sorry, yes our grandmothers worked physically harder than we do today, but people in this day and time have a lot more social issues to deal with than our grandparents ever had to.

On the third week of taking it, I began to experience bizzare thoughts, memory loss (forgot how to use my windshield wipers), lightheaded out-of-body sensations, increased insomnia, compulsiveness and weight gain. By the fourth week, I became psychotic...I made crisis phone calls to strangers, ended friendships, became violent and broke neighbor's windows in addition to trashing my own house, and actually contemplated suicide.  These behaviors are/were totally out-of-character for me and I am absolutely certain the Lexapro caused the behaviors. I really 'lost my mind' on this drug.  It took almost three weeks to wean off this drug, and I was an emotional and mental mess throughout it all. It took a long time for my brain to recover from it, and it added to my depression....

2182$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/7/2009 7:20:00 PM$Reviewer: leary, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$"I have only taken Lexapro for one day and am very concerned about taking it any more based on the MANY reviews I've read on multiple websites.

I have been under sustained stress (i.e., sickness, death, post-menopause, having to care for disabled family members, finances, etc., etc.) and finally realize that I just can't do it all.  So, I went to my doctor who prescribed 10mg./day.

Took the first one yesterday - and while I was okay for the most part, I just felt strange -- probably a bit anxious.  I also take Xanax (particularly for headaches since it's the only thing that works), and the doctor said to take 2/day along with the lexapro.

Stress and increased post-menopausal symptoms are my primary issues right now.  Based on everything I've ready, I'm very leary about taking Lexapro.  In fact, I did not take it today.  Unfortunately, I transferred into a department where I thought opportunities would be better and a healthier work environment, but it's the total opposite.  So, it's multiple issues that have accumulated over time, and everyone has their limit.

I will call the doctor tomorrow and see if 5mg a day (or every other day) would be worth a try.  Maybe the 10mg is just too much for me.

I'm a very active person and must be able to function at work every day -- not so sure this stuff will improve my ability to do the things I need to do..."

Then I had the misfortune of stepping on a scale, boy was I surprised to find that I had gained 20 lbs on this medicine...which made no sense considering I walk a minimum of 4 miles each day.  I have since been switched to Zoloft & it is working great (without the weight gain).  I hope Lexapro works for some of you, just be careful not to let the weight get as out of control as I did.

For the 1st week I felt worse but stuck with it. The only adverse side effect now from Lexapro is the anorgasmia. My doctor has prescribed 150 MG of Wellbutrin XL (Eon Labs-Buproprion XL 150mg) to counter the anorgasmia but I have only been on it for 1 day so we will see if it helps. I am praying it helps without adverse side effects.

Been taking Lexapro for at least 6-7 years.  I have gained 50 lbs. but I am sane.  I cannot exist without medication.  I see in these blogs that people give up too easily.  What's more important to you?  A few side effects, weight gain, loss of sex drive OR death by suicide?  Life in a mental facility.  Some of you might not need these medications at all.  Some seem to be using it because you're unhappy.  Do any of you realize what it means to be truly mentally ill.  Lexapro is my lifesaver.  I take 40mg daily plus 150mg Wellbutrin, plusTrazodone at bedtime.  Please give the meds a chance to work no matter what you're on.  Sometimes it takes 3-4 weeks to have an affect.

The first day was easy going for never being on medication like this before. No side effects other then dry mouth and slightly lightened colors (that was confusing). Although, about a week or two later, I started to get very extreme dreams,something like being Ironman. Anyways, The first day was like a miracle compared to the day before ridden with full of anxiety, and nervous moments. 
I'm not 100% sure if I personally want to continue with this just because of the dreams,and inability to orgasm easily anymore. I do recommend that it is taken at night, it totally knocks me out, sleep fairly well till the dreams. But over all, after hearing things about other drugs of this type, This has been a very good experience for a first-timer such as myself  :) "

It worked ok, but the side effects can be horrible. Even after this long, I still have memory problems and sometimes pretty severe headaches, on top of other issues. It controlled my panic attacks pretty well, but the side effects are getting to me. The withdrawal from this medication isn't pleasant either with nausea, more headaches and the occassional crying fits, but worth it in my eyes to be free of this medication and easier to manage with behavior mod therapy. I know it's worked wonders for others, but it's just not for me.

Months later, I had moved in with my boyfriend, and would constantly find new girls he was talking to in his phone. I eventually got to the point where I wouldnt want to leave the house, doing fun things was like a chore I had to make myself do. I was contantly anxious and would think up any worse case scenerio I could. I eventually had a breakdown, and had gotten physical with loved ones. Which is extremely outside of my character. I broke down and decided I couldn't live with myself and push any more friends and family away from me anymore. The dr. diagnosed me with severe depression- with mild anxiety. I began on 10mg and three weeks later I was switched to 20mg (because I would still get a little irritated at nite when the meds when begin to ware off). I noticed right away I was beginning to feel better, I started talking to my friends more and just began ""loving"" everyone like I used to. I enjoy going out and being social again. A huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Which is good when you're only 22. I don't dwell on the past anymore and I'm not so in my head and not as angry. I'm more independent. This drug is very expensive and has made me very tired. I could sleep all day everyday if I wanted to. But anyway- I didnt realise how bad I used to be until now, it's no way to live."

I am hoping to have the same reaction to treatment as last time but I think I will be on it longer than the 8 months this time around.

I resisted meds until I became absolutely suicidal.  I felt an immediate change within three days of starting Lexapro.  I was very drowsy, nauseous, and my vision was impaired, but that gave way quickly.  However, two weeks later, the beneficial effects disappeared and I experienced a rough drop back into depression, sadness, and anxiety.  Another week later, everything was stabilized, and each month on Lexapro has given me a gradually better quality of mental health.  

It does, however, play havoc with your memory and sex drive.  I still feel unmotivated, but the initial sluggishness I felt at the beginning is slowly evaporating.  I made the proper choice. 

Skipping a dose isn't a problem for a day or two, but withdrawal is very unpleasant.  I recommend very gradual titration if you want to stop taking it for whatever reason."

Lexapro so I tried the 10mg dose.  It took a week or two to feel a change but it definitely works for me.  My wife tells me I'm a lot easier to live with and frankly I feel more comfortable most of the time.  I'm certainly much less depressed than before.  I recommend it for those that reap its benefits.  Like any drug, it's probably not for everyone.  However there are some negative considerations as well.  It's harder to wake up in the morning.  I take naps when I can.  Sometimes I fall asleep reading a book, where I never used to.  Sexual desire is down but not gone.  I don't feel it has inhibited an erection but sometimes reaching orgasm can be difficult.  I guess that's why they make Viagra.  Another thing to consider is, don't miss a dose.  I failed to take it one morning and noticed I was a bit more grouchy than usual that day.  I took it the following day and was so spaced out at work that I hope I never forget to take it again.  I was forgetting people's names I had known for a while.  Familiar things were unfamiliar.  It was scary.  The following days were fine as long as I stay on the drug.  I've heard it was hard discontinuing usage of Lexapro now I believe it.  The positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me."

I have taken just about every anti-depressant there is and hated the way they made me feel and LOOK. When I was on Paxil, I gained about 15-20 lbs and I am a slim, small-boned person. I was not eating more, so I could not figure out why this was happening. Anyway, I weaned off Paxil and was on nothing for a while. I was going through a very difficult time personally. Then the flu-like symptoms of fibro returned as well as depression and anxiety. I discussed this with a psychiatrist and asked to be put on Lexapro (recommended to me). She said that would be a good choice for me as it is ""weight neutral."" I have been on Lexapro 40mg for about 3 years and it has been a good choice for me. After reading some of the reviews, I wonder if I should be taking Lexapro at night instead of in the morning. My fatigue level is high most of the time. Now I am thinking it may be due, in part, to the Lexapro."

I started hormone treatment for those symptoms, but my mood swings were still there, and my IBS and acid reflux starting going through the roof. Taking lexapro has made my symptoms so much better. I have gained about 20 lbs but it can be taken care of. I have since lost 12 pounds so it just takes time to get used of. As a mother of 3 small children, lexapro helps me to deal with their yelling and fighting. IT just relaxes me more a lot more than without it.

I had constant thought of hurting people which it not me at all.  I am a very loving thoughtful person.  I went through a period of numbness where I didn't feel much once I started taking Lexapro which I did not like at all.  I couldn't feel love, happiness, or joy.....but I also could leave the house and not feel terrified.  After about 3 months of being on Lexapro I am very happy to say that I am a much happier person.  I am back to myself.  Like everyone I have my good days and my bad, but it is no where close to how I was before.  I have not had much weight gain.  A small amount but I chalk that up to the fact that I had lost almost 20lbs when I had my sever OCD.  I would rather have a few extra lbs than not be able to leave my house.  I highly recommend giving this drug a try if suggested.  Like every medication, different things work for different people. Oh and also.....you have got to exercise.  That is no lie when your doctor says that it will help and I imagine that it keeps the weight gain at bay as well.

My dr put me on lexapro, and it worked immediately! I had some tingling the first time I took it, which was weird, so I cut it in half and took 5mg instead of 10. It is May, and I started taking it November 5, and I have had 1 panic attack since. There is a downfall...in these 6 months I have gained 22lbs without changing any of my eating habits and I cannot get it off. I've been on a 1200 calorie low fat diet for about three weeks with exercise and NO CHEATING. I have gained 2 lbs. Now I am more miserable than I was before. I would definitely advise you to try something else first. Only use lexapro as your last resort. I am currently weaning off of it, and I have been dizzy, irritable, and had lots of headaches. This is from only taking 5mg!! Please be careful, and check out all these medications before you start taking them.

I no longer suffer form crippling depression or the manic mood swings that would keep me from sleeping for days on end. What used to be a slingshot rollercoaster ride of emotion has become a leisurely drive through the country. For the most part I average 8 hours of sleep a night now instead of 10-12. I can also get to sleep very easily compared to the nights of laying awake for 3-4 hours because my mind wouldn't shut off. I haven't noticed any side affects. I am an artist and haven't noted any lack of creativity or ""passion"" for my work. In fact quite the opposite. Now that I am for the most part in control of myself, I can tap into that creativity and passion whenever I want. No weight gain, lose or increase of appetite, loss of sex drive, or even any nausea. I control my emotions now, not the other way around. I have just recently moved back to the city where I went to college 10 years ago and reconnected with some old friends who noticed immediately the change in my demeanor and composure, commenting that I seemed to be much happier and in control."

This medication WILL work for you, but you have to give it time.  In the beginning, I experienced chills, increased anxiety, and nausia.  These side effects will go away after the first few weeks.  It is worth it to ride through the rough few weeks because this medication has especially helped me with anxiety.  I would say that after 3 months, you will really begin to see the full benefit of the medication.  I gained a few pounds, but with exercise and diet, you can maintain normal weight.  Having a good support system around is a very crucial part to feeling better as well.  Hope this helps you and, feel better!!

It make me extremely drowsy to were I couldn't keep my eyes open during the day and had to drink energy drinks to make it through work. Now I have been on Lexapro for a little over a month and I love it. I couldn't imagine going a day without it. It doesn't make me happy all the time but it certainly levels me out. I feel much more upbeat and positive then I have ever been before in my life. In the beginning, I started taking it at night before bed and I wasn't sleeping well at all. I seemed to have insomnia so I switched to taking it in the morning. It definitely works much better for me to take it in the morning and I sleep well at night now. Overall, it has worked wonders on me. It's not for everybody but it is a trial and error process. If it works for you, stick to it. If it doesn't work for you, try something different.

Well I can and its awful. My best friend was killed by a drunk driver when I was in 7th grade and my freshmen year of high school I was diagnosed with depression. I'm now a sophomore in college and life without lexapro is awful. My roomates, who I've only known for two years, can even see a difference in me when I miss my medication for more than a week. There has never been a downside for me taking this drug, I've never had any of side effect and it has greaty improved my life. I'm happier all the time and have more energy and want to get out and do things. I guess the only bad thing about it is when I miss for like over a week (which is rare but happens) there is a drastic swing in my mood and its clear to me and everyone around me. I am a totally different person when I dont take the drug. I'm afraid that I am dependant on it, and although I dont want to be on Lexapro my whole life, I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

2343$Condition: Depression$4/16/2009 6:06:40 PM$Reviewer: drtobe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on Lexapro for a year and have been very pleased with the results.  Take it for depression/anxiety combo.  Started out on Lorazepam for anxiety attacks, but quickly realized I needed a daily medication.  Had used Xanax for a short period a few years ago, but I like the Lexapro because it isn't habit forming (I'm sure there are withdrawal symptoms, but it isn't addictive).  Started at 10mg, which worked fine until I was laid-off earlier this year, so I switched to 20mg.  Doing fine on 20mg and plan to stay.  Lexapro has made a huge difference in my life - I used to have trouble sleeping, was disinterested in life in general, often wondered what the point of living was, and would constantly worry about EVERYTHING.  I felt improvement of my depression within 1 week of receiving the prescription.  A word on side effects:  I too felt EXTREME fatigue, nausea, terrible headaches, and lack of appetite in the first couple of days.  I was taking it in the morning before going to work and I honestly felt AWFUL within an hour of taking it - but the depression was getting better so I hung in there with the medication, figuring the side effects would go away once my body adjusted to the medication.  I also switched to taking the medication at night right before I went to bed instead of in the morning, so any side effects would occur while I was sleeping and I didn't feel them as much.  Thankfully making that switch did the trick and as far as I know the side effect went away after the first week or so.  Give it time if you're just starting or thinking about starting.

This has helped.

Before I was taking it I couldnt even get out of bed most days. Just a small dose a day helped. I had a few side effects like weight gain and I lost my sex drive. Sometimes I would feel like my head was in a fog but taking it before bed helped that problem. Would still be taking Lexapro if I could afford to take it.

I was having panic attacks and couldn't finish a thought yet would lay awake at night and stress all day about anything and everything. I was prescribed 10 mg at first and took that for about a month. After having another awful panic attack in my sleep I asked the doctor to up the dosage. Now I have been taking 20mg for over 2 years and it does wonders for me. I am more even-tempered and don't have the anxiety/panic attacks. Sometimes I still struggle with stressing about things but not like I did before. I can finish a thought and think clearly. It has improved my memory (I have a really bad memory-some short term and long term)and I am able to function much better daily. I did have sexual side effects for a long while but after so long those seemed to dissolve as well. I wish I could tell everyone who needs help about this and how it has helped me. There's nothing more relieving than to be able to function everyday on a normal basis. I would recomment atleast trying this medication.

I was given samples of lexapro by my dr. and he thought it would work great for me. After a few weeks, I started feeling better over all. Then I turned for the worst! I admitted myself to the ER twice and wanted nothing to do with life. The attacks got so severe that i demanded a change. I'm going to try a new med. that does help with bi-polar and depression. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it'll work. Remember though, this is your life, and if you need a change, speak up!

I don't care if the house work gets done, bills get paid, clothes get washed etc, I just don't care.  I went on a diet soon after starting the drug--I lost 75 pounds in 5 months.  It was not the drug that helped me lose the weight,  I believe the drug helped me stop obsessing about things--food included--and that was what finally helped me lose weight.  Did have sexual side effects, dry mouth (which improved after a few weeks) and some difficulty sleeping.  Unfortunately my insurance will no longer pay and doc wants to switch me to Celexa.  I am super paranoid about gaining weight on Celexa (although weight gain is often a side effect of Lexapro, too) and as I stated before, Lexapro did not make me gain weight.  I am hoping for the best as I switch to Celexa.  FYI--my doc said Lexapro is an improved version of Celexa.  Lexapro is escitalopram and Celexa is scitalopram, so again, I am hoping for the best in my experience with Celexa.

Had been taking Prozac for 10 years previously, but started having anxiety attacks and doctor prescribed Lexapro 10 mgs daily. Worked great the first month with minor side effects (tiredness, hunger), but then I noticed that I was feeling angry or irritable a lot of the time. When I cut the pill in half or skipped a day, the anger would simmer down. I started taking half a pill a day about two months ago and that seems to work okay. Frequent bouts of worry (but not full-blown anxiety) have started it up, but I'm trying out some stress reduction techniques to help alleviate angst.

However, I have noticed that the it has seemed to wear off and I have gradually been getting back those nasty old feelings (trouble sleeping,feel like I can't get enough air sometimes, nervousness, biting my nails all the time, short tempered with people, heart palpitations,headaches). I have also noticed that my libido has gone completely out the window, which is horrible. My Dr. has now prescribed me to Zoloft 50MG. I pray that works for me.

I would take less med and spread the days apart. I started experiencing a strange sensation in my head especially when turning my head quickly, I would take a small chip of the pill and the sensation would go away. This lasted for about 6 weeks and then the side effect started subsiding, be sure to wean yourself off this drug. Now that I'm not taking any meds, reality is not as easy to cope with and am debating about returning to Lexapro for the escape and to return to ""whatever."""

My husband and I are trying to have a baby and in order to do that, I safely weaned myself off of Lexapro.  Wow, gradual or not, the side effects were some of the worst I have ever experienced.  I have been on and off of several medications since I was 14 years old (I am 28 now) and I have never experienced withdrawal symptoms like those I did with Lexapro.  The dizziness and nausea was too much to handle. I was literally off balance for a month and my brain was constantly ""re-setting"" itself making my vision blurred, causing headaches, lack of balance and exhaustion.  I recommend to everyone to truly investigate teh side effects of this medication BEFORE you start taking it.  It is now six weeks later and most of the symptoms have subsided except an occassional dizzy spell.  Please talk to your doctor about teh side effects of this medication adn teh withdrawal sympoms which can last anywhere from 2 days to 3 months."

The sadness and worthlessness are gone. I can actually get up and do things, and I actually like myself for once. The panic and anxiety I usually feel happen a lot less. So in those areas, the drug works. However, the sadness and worthlessness have been replaced by what can only be described as, whatever. I just don't care anymore. And it's not like, oh nothing is worth it, I don't care anymore. It's simply not there emotion-wise. It's like everything is blank. Blank and a little foggy at times. On top of that, I started overeating. Full, or not, I'm constantly hungry and have to stop myself from eating all day long. I also have a slight ringing in my ears sometimes. So I have mixed feelings on this drug.

Ever since, I have been a basket case.  The insurance wants me to be a ""rat"" and try other drugs in the meantime, and right now (after several others) I am on Celexa-a similar version of Lexapro-but not close enough.  I was also on Topamax with the Lexapro, and dropped a signifigant amount of weight.  I NEVER felt better--not just because of the weight loss, but EVERYTHING.  And believe me, I was under a LOT of stress-backstabbed by a friend who ended up with my husband at the time, and of course my hub and I ended up going through a divorce; death of family members; a close friend; my dog; dang-there's a country song...the Lexapro worked.  And I can especially see it now.  Presently, I am on Lamictal and Celexa. I gained all my weight back and more, am more depressed, feel like kicking the crap out of my ex and his wife.

My chronic anxiety had started to manifest itself into irratibility.  This medicine has make a tremendous difference in my life.  My first two weeks on the medication I experienced side effects where I felt ""foggy"" headed, sleepy and I yawned a lot.  I also felt very relaxed and unconcerned which was a relief.  After that I started to wonder if the effects of the drug had worn off.  What I didn't realize is that I had stop ""blowing up"" at my family at the end of the day.  My level of anxiety and subsequent irratibility is the lowest it has been in many years.  The only side effect I experience now is a slightly reduced interest in sex.  For me, the benefits far outweigh this negative.  In my case, interest and performance are inter related.  I am 46 yo MWM.  My ability to perform is not diminished by the medicine, but my interest is.  However, when my interest is there, I can perform as any male my age can.  

I am much more relaxed and patient while taking this medication and my relationships have improved because of this.

Also, Lexapro works on BOTH sides of your brain, Celexa only on side at a time. I am so thankful for this medication, I have my life back!!! If it makes you sleepy,take it at nite. If it keeps you up,take it in the am. It is worth you time to really give this medication time to balance your panic attacks and anxiety. Work with your Dr. Best Wishes, God Bless!

I would rate it a C+, But I do believe I can be far off better then where I am now. As far as side effects, none that I can report of.

It made me feel ""normal"" again.  I felt like I was made whole again.  It allowed me to have emotions, but I was in control of them and could deal with them appropriatly.  The two very unfortunate side effects to this medicine were severe weight gain.  I was 118 and am now 147.  I gained this much weight in a matter of just seven months.  I finally requested to go off this medicine and have been off it now for two weeks with no weight loss yet.  The other very serious thing that occurred with me is that my sodium level dropped severly low and the doctors thought my addrenal gland was failing.  It was only after a great number of tests that they realized it was the Lexapro that was causing my low sodium levels.  I was so low, I was put on anti seizure medicine and was also at risk for stroke.  I would be cautious in recommending this medicine to people."

Immediately after her death I began Xanax but became immume to it within a week so my doctor put me on 10 mgs Lexapro. It has been excellent!

I dont cry all the time.  If you are going through the unexpected death of a loved one, this medicine will help you make it through each day sanely.  It may not be for all though, a few friends and a cousin could not take it for they gained weight and they felt ""medicine head"".  It was hard for them to think clearly.  My experience has not been that way, it keeps my appetite under control and I have not gained weight.  I plan on staying on Lexiprol for the next year.

My doc said it din't matter if I took it in the morning or at night.  I think I will switch to taking it at night to see if I am more awake during the day  - however, night sleeping has been good.  I specifically asked for a drug that would NOT put weight on  - too soon to tell about that, but I seem to be less hungry during the day  - maybe I'll be one of the lucky ones who actually lose!!  However, this is apparently a pretty powerful drug, efective or not, so I'd be careful with starting or stopping it.

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression & Panic/Anxiety attacks mainly related to death of my mom and overall loss of both parents. I started with celexa then was eventually changed to lexapro. Simply said, this medication saved me from serious issues.  Initially doctors ""played"" around with some other antidepressants that did not help and more often made issues worse or caused worse side effects.  That trial period of being a lab rat was not pleasant but ultimately a good doctor finally decided it was seratonin that needed and so I began taken the meds. Under doctors supervision I have been taken off or switched to other meds on three occasions over the last eleven years and ultimately go back to lexapro.  It's the one that works best for me.  The worst thing about this drug is the associated weight gain but I've decided I'd rather have a ""muffin top"" and be a positive, happy person than wallow in fear, anxiety and sadness each day.  Not to mention, the only person stopping me from exercising to lose the weight is me."

The side affects I experienced at the beginning were nausea, headache, dizziness, tiredness, etc - the usual. I stopped & started the Lexapro several times due to the side affects.  However, I found if I gave it more time (at least 2 weeks) it worked wonderfully with the Wellbutrin.  Especially for anxiety.  The only pitfall I experienced was a very decreased libido and lack of orgasm.  This placed stress on my marriage.  I weighed the cost & once again stopped taking it after a few weeks. It has now been about 3 months off the drug and I'm having anxiety almost everyday.  I know I need something to supplement the Wellbutrin & the Lexapro did wonders except for the libido.  It's quite possible I didn't hang on long enough to see if that symptom subsided as well.  I most likely will go back on it since the overall result was positive and helped me to feel more like my old self.  After all, it is about the one taking the medication - to ward off the anxiety and depression, right?  Therefore, in my opinion if you can get past the initial onset of side effects, Lexapro is a winner! Side note for another writer - Wellbutrin works when you don't even realize it.  Try going off it & see if others don't notice."

I lost my friends, I scared my family, and I had to drop out of school because I was put on stay of commitment.  While I was in the hospital watching TV I saw an ad urging people to sue the drug companies if they or someone they knew tried to kill themselves while on certain medications.  Lexapro was one of them.  I had been put on this drug to lower my depression, when in fact it just increased the probability that I would try to kill myself.

Zoloft worked for a while, but eventually I needed pretty  high daily doses.  Parnate (a MAOI) worked very well, but it comes with too many restrictions and adverse interactions with other drugs. Lexapro combined with Wellbutrin has worked extremely well for more than 2 years and this treatment has helped me find a real stable place with ups and downs, but no dramatic swings in either direction. With other drugs I found that after a while I was confident I could handle it myself, only to find a deeper depression when I stopped meds and resistence to the same meds for treating the new episode.

In the past, I have taken Zoloft and Prozac.  Since I have started taking all of these medicines for depression (15 years), I have gained 35 pounds. It doesn't make a difference if I exercise and watch my food intake (Which I do).  And the doctors I have had tell me I need to exercise more.  The medicine has nothing to do with it.  That alone is depressing for me.

Most doctors do not warn patients about SSRI DISCONTINUATION SYNDROME, so please research this before deciding that Lexapro is right for you.

Lexapro was fairly effective at easing my depression, but every time I missed a dose, I felt sick.  Because of this, and the sexual side effects (complete inability to orgasm, no arousal during sex, no interest in sex), I decided to switch to Wellbutrin, and let me tell you, DISCONTINUING LEXAPRO IS HELL.  PLEASE, please before taking Lexapro, look up SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome on Wikipedia. It has been over a month since I finally tapered off Lexapro, and I have felt sick the whole time.  It's like having the flu every day but it doesn't go away, and the feeling of being ""zapped"" every few minutes is VERY disconcerting.  I am only JUST starting to feel better, however I still get major headaches every day, I feel like I have a low-grade fever and my body still hurts most of the time.  
If you do take Lexapro, DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY. TAPER OFF VERY SLOWLY to lessen the very unpleasant effects of discontinuing it.  My doctor had me taking 50mg/day, which sounds like a lot, but it took that much to be effective for me. But nobody warned me that I would have to take it the rest of my life or suffer the misery of discontinuing it. 
Lexapro can be a very effective medication, and the benefits of taking it can outweigh the problems it may cause, so do the research and make an educated decision based upon your personal needs.
Keep in mind that WebMD is sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, so you probably won't find anything about SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome here unless you are reading what patients have submitted.  
Please research carefully and thoroughly so that you understand exactly what you are getting into if you do decide to take Lexapro.  "

I'm in love with this drug and can't say enough about it. My mood has calmed down completely. I woke up with anxiety the other night and realized that it was the first time in the entire time I've been on Lexapro that I had anxiety (as opposed to multiple times daily before being prescribed Lexapro). I haven't noticed many side effects other then hunger. It doesnt seem to last 24 hours, so my doctor put me on 50mg of Seroquel at night and that has completely alleviated the sleeping problems.

I have a more optimistic view, things don't seem so overwhelming and I have much less anger.  Others around me have noticed as well.  It has really changed my life.

2527$Condition: Depression$2/17/2009 2:52:41 PM$Reviewer: bigbill, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$4$"A lifelong sufferer of depression, I started taking Lexapro 10mg 18 months ago. The first 2-3 weeks I experienced nausea and stomach cramps, but these went away completely. My mood is much better and I am able to enjoy life again. The side-effects I've had are drowsiness, disruption in sleep patterns, weight gain, difficulty achieving orgasm. 

I take it in the morning and get very sleepy around 2-3PM. I tried taking it other times. When I took it in the evening, it was very difficult to wake up in the morning. Other times of day I had trouble remembering it. Sometimes I've had issues with insomnia; inability to sleep until 3-4AM but this was rare.

I've put on about 30 lbs. since I've been taking Lexapro. I was too skinny before, so this hasn't been a real problem.

The sexual side effects are a nuisance. An understanding (and creative) partner can help there."

It has helped with my irritability tremendously and I haven't experienced extreme mania or depression, but my mood is down a lot more than it is 'normal'.  I stopped taking it for 10 days and I noticed the mood swings coming back.  One minute I'd be so happy and carefree and a few hours later I'd feel myself getting depressed.  The depression I feel without it is scary, but I think I need something more to take away the 'down' feeling.  Also, I lose my train of thought in mid-sentence.

I have now been switched to another medication.  I have reached a point that it doesn't help me any longer and for the past year have been fatigued and rapidly gaining weight.  With any medication, your body just doesn't respond like it used to, so I have now switched to another medication. My suggestion is 1 to 1 1/2 years maximum on this medication."

Most docs don't tell you that you may need more than just one drug. The best combination for me is Lexapro 10mg at night + Wellbutrin XL 150mg in the morning. Initially, I was on too high a dose of each individually, and almost gave up. Luckily, it took awhile, but I feel like a new person. Docs don't tell you that you build up an immunity to most SRRIs (like Lexapro) over time. Wellbutrin helps fill in the gaps, helps improve libido, and increase energy. Worst side effect of Lexapro didn't turn up for two years...night sweats. They're horrible, yet they go away completely if I skip my dose for a few nights. Ob/gyn tested hormones for menopause and that's not the problem. Weird that the side effect listings don't describe that problem. It should be easier to report side effects to the government. The FDA website makes the process next to impossible unless someone has died as a result of the drug. Overall, Lexapro is worth trying for its milder side effects, but no generic is available just yet.

I am very pleased with the outcome of Lexapro! I can sleep all night without waking up 5-6 times a night. No side affects at all. Very effective and I would recommend for anyone going through menapausal symptoms. I was shocked when my Dr. said it could help my symptoms. I only take 5mg before bedtime.

I just wanted to curl up and hide under a rock. Lexapro got me out of the ""dark pit"" initially, but I wanted to just sleep to avoid thinking about the losses. Dr. gave me Provigil to help me get up and be awake to rejoin life. I no longer take the Provigil, but feel great. I still miss my loved ones, but I can deal with it and other situations (like recently having breast cancer) without crawling back into the ""pit"". The only drawback is that if I miss a couple of doses, I get a bad headache, and I understand that this is common.

Then I had my first panic attack.  I was sure I was going insane.  Dr. put me on Lexapro 20mg per day and Klonopin as needed if I felt an attack coming on.  The Klonopin also helped ease the transition onto the Lexapro.  I was able to stop taking the Klonopin after a couple of weeks when the Lexapro was fully effective.  In the time since the Dr. has bumped my Lexapro dose up to 30mg per day.  After nearly 2 years I have not had a single panic attack and my anxiety issues are gone.  I feel normal again.  I only take a Klonopin if I am going into a situation that I know will cause stress (like flying), and that is only a couple of times per year.  The rest of the time I am doing fine on the Lexapro, sleeping well, not worrying all the time, sweating less, etc.  I don't care if I have to stay on this for the rest of my life, I feel normal and happy again, and that's worth it. I take it at night just before bed because it does make me sleepy. This drug is not for everyone, so don't give up if it doesn't work well for you, try Effexor or Welbutrin.  You don't have to live with panic or anxiety, it is caused by a chemical issue that CAN be treated with the right drugs.  Best of luck to you, and get yourself well!

2641$Condition: Depression$1/14/2009 6:58:32 PM$Reviewer: Cinderella, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$2$4$I have read about 100 of the reviews posted for this and wish I could talk to some of these people.  I just took myself OFF of Lexapro because it has left me feeling like a zombie.  I can't get off the couch & my anxiety builds as I watch things around my home pile up because I'm not getting anything done.  The side effects from going off this medication are scary to say the least. I feel like 1 lady who posted w/one of my withdrawls from this med. Small brain seizures (as if someone is startling me), headache, shaky, super rapid heart beat and when I move my body I feel as though I tingle all over and that I am going to fall down. It's as though I cant control what my body is doing.  I used Lexapro for depression, migraines, extreme pain & panic attacks after my ex-husband tried to kill himself. The coward tried to kill himself when I caught him cheating 4 times in 6 months while he was out of town working. I had my beautiful 2 year old son with me when all of this happened & I just fell into such a deep depression because he didnt stop the damage to our family with the suicide attempt, he ruined us financially, tried to get full custody, let our truck get repoed while I had our son at the grocery store and the list goes on.  I went through several antidepressants and this one had the least amount of side effects.  I feel as though I built up a resistance to it because I just didn't want to do anything anymore.  Thus, I took myself off of it and the withdrawls are terrible.  I really want to try and change my diet & exercise to balance out my body and it's chemical makeup.  I hope the things I am feeling now go away within a couple of days because I am even afraid to drive my car.  I just feel like someone is shaking me and my body is tingling.  Best of luck to all of you that are trying to get healthy and I hope there comes a day when doctors stop pushing pills for everything.  ebaydeals07 at yahoo dot com.

The positives are a balance in mood and behavior.  The side effects are extreme somnolence, inability to achieve orgasm, low sex drive, mild confusion and forgetfulness, nausea, and indifference and lack of drive.
I stopped taking the medication for 1 month.  I experienced mild brain seizures(it feels like being startled continuously for 5-10 min). They began lessening as more time went by.  I started smelling odors that were not present, and I experienced extreme confusion and inability to focus and forgetfulness.  On top of that, my depression and inability to experience beauty and thoughts of suicide returned.  I'm going to see my doctor and go back on Lexapro or try a different medication.  I hope there is no negative long term or permanent changes that occur in my brain due to these medications.

My doc and I felt that I needed it for severe anxiety and major depression.  I am also taking Bupropion. My husband has terminal cancer and my mother is very ill, so the stress has been great.  After taking one pill yesterday morning, about two hours later, I had tention in my muscles, severe shaking, hightened anxiety with exhaustion, and inability to sleep past 5 hours. I had a friend come over because I was so scared. I also could not eat after I took the pill.  I cannot aford to lose any more weight.  I've already lost 25 over the last year, 15 in the last month do to stress.  I am going to take the pill again today, but not until I have a large breakfast.  I do for the first time in a year feel hungry this morning.  I will try Lexapro for one week.  If the side effects don't go away, I will stop and try something else. 
Am am really frustrated that I have to take medications, but I am also greatful that they are out there.  I guess I worry more about the long term effects more then short term.  Plus what is going into our water systems?  Two headed fish and frogs?  If it makes some of us have no labido, then what will it do to the whales?!?  We are all drinking the same water.  Maybe that is why so many people are having mental health issues in the first place!  Just thinking."

I took Lexapro for 11 years after the death of my son and husband.  Got tired of taking it and AMA, I weaned myself off it a little tiny bit at a time.  I actually shaved down the tablet over 4 months until there was nothing left.  Side effects were ""brain freeze"", delayed vision, nausea, headache, feeling like I was falling backwards, and other minor ones.  I put my friends and employer on notice and they helped out a lot.  If you decide to withdraw, do it very, very slowly and watch for the side effects.  They disappear over time.  I've been off 2 years now and I'm fine.  I cry but I prefer that to not feeling anything. On the other hand, Lexapro helped me get through the roughest thing I'll ever experience.

Not to scare anyone but I didn't take well to Lexapro. The side effects were overwhelming especially considering I am 29 and very healthy and in shape. It made me very depressed, when I have no history of depression, and the sexual side effects were   staggering. I took 10mg's for two weeks in combo with lorzepam and 20mg'f for the last two weeks. It simply wasn't worth it- I'd rather deal with the panic. I'm back to valium here and there for now and though I realize this drug can and has done great things for a lot of people, I really didn't take well to it and it was not the drug for me. The onset of the side effects took a few weeks and I gave it a try but, if you're at all like me, don't feel bad if this drug is not for you. Everyone is different and I can assure everyone I will never touch this stuff again. I had night terrors on it and depression I don't care to revisit.

I want it to work so bad, I've taken it religiously since I begun on it. I had some side effects in the first month or so, but really I haven't noticed anything major.

I started taking it early in the year and it took a while to work. The 1st 2 weeks were a little difficult because I would get frequent headaches, excessive sweating (all known side affects). Then once I adjusted it worked great. I felt so normal. Went off the drug on own and had terrible withdrawals. I would have really bad headaches that would last for days and frequent anxiety attacks. I even stressed out so bad that I got shingles. Dr put me back on it and its been almost 2 weeks and I am starting to feel great again. I recommend this drug to anyone who suffers from constant anxiety.

Before taking Lexapro I was taking Effexor XR.  After weaning off of Effexor XR (which I had been taking for about 6 years for anxiety and depression) I began having horrible panic attacks.  My doctor put me back on Effexor XR but it did not help at all, so I began taking Lexapro (15mg daily).  It was a wonder drug!  My panic attacks stopped and I have not had one since taking the drug.  I am now trying to wean off Lexapro and went from 15 mg to 10mg in March of 2008 and just went from 10mg to 5 mg last Friday.  I am experiencing intense night sweats, blurred vision and mood swings since going down to 5 mg.  I really hope this will stop after my body adjusts to the new levels in my system soon.  Has anyone else out there successfully gotten off of this drug???

I remember the day I started it.  A few hours after I took the first dose, I became very very ill. I was at work, sweating, throwing up, just a terrible feeling. I called the Dr. He said it will pass in about a week or two, and to just wait it out.  It did work very well for my panic attackes.  Before I would pass out from them, but after taking the medicine they almost stopped.  I would have a few every now and then.  The side effects were horrible. The throwing up stopped after the first week. I had sever dry mouth, and then got the wonder side effect of not being able to achieve orgasm. I didn't know it could effect females like that.  I evently had to stop taking it. It was very frustrating not being able to ""finish"" with my partner.  It made her feel like she was not good enough.  That was not the case.  But anyway my panic attacks have been coming back but not nearly as strong. If it didn't have that side effect then I would probably still be taking it. I now take Wellbutrin XL and Seroquel. They seem to be working okay other then the Seroquel has made me gain weight like crazy."

Don't take my word for it, go to their website and read about it. It is mostly amino-acids, herbs and Sam-e.  No St. Johns Wort. I have only been on it for 2 weeks and already feel much calmer, more hopeful, less anxious and actually in a good mood, feeling happy about Christmas coming.

I tried Zoloft for about a year, but it didn't help me much, and when I stopped taking it, my depression became more severe. Lexapro has proven itself much more effective, in my case. It's easy to use because you can take it anytime in the day, as long as you're somewhat consistent with at what time of day you take it. The only major problem that I have experienced is decreased energy. I become tired just a few hours after awakening and feel the need for sleep at a much earlier time. Other than that, I have felt more confident, less pessimistic, and much less anxious while being on Lexapro.

I would feel very lightheaded. I was taking it in the morning though. I switched to nighttime and after about a week or two the side effects went away. So to anyone out there experiencing side effects give the medication a try for about two weeks. I was on 10mg at first and I did notice a difference. I wasn't so high strung, was able to focus so much better, and was able to deal with life in general much better. This only lasted for a couple of weeks and then I was back where I started. I went back to the doctor and he doubled the dosage to 20mg. I must say I've been taking it now for about a year and half and it is WONDERFUL for me! I am able to handle situations that I never would have been able to handle before. It also helps me with my ""monthly"" bouts of depression. If you're a female you know what I mean. I've got to be honest this has been a wonder drug for me. I realize that medication effects people differently and what's good for one person may not be good for another. But, if offered Lexapro by your physician, give it a chance. As with most other drugs you will probably experience some sort of side effects the first week or two.

When i first stated it i felt very ""weird"", i was always dizzy, and my head hurt. This all went away after a while but the medicine never seemed to help really help me.  I was alwys tired and still sad only i no longer cared i was sad. Nothing bothered me, i was like a brick wall.  I decided to stop the medicine, but instead of talking to my doctor about it i just stopped taking the medicine.  DO NOT DO THIS!!! My emotions went out of control, i was dizzy, had nausea, a headache theat would not go away, and was shaky.  I know of people who have greatly benifited from this medicine, it just wasnt something that worked for me."

Weaning off of it was a nightmare. I felt like I had the flu for 4 months.  I had to wean VERY gradually to avoid severe headaches, feeling comatose.  Though it helped me through a tough era, I must admit if had I know about the withdrawal symptoms I would never have taken it.  I'm an active, busy person and I felt miserably sick during the weaning.  If you need to wean, get appropriate advice on doing it slowly.

The first side effect I began to notice was stiffening of muscles followed by joint pains.  I've now been off the drug for about 2 months and the joint pains haven't gotten any better.  I feel it prominently in the bones of my knees and elbows.  Beyond that, while on Lexapro, I had lowered sex drive, increased appetite, dizziness, and slight drowsiness, all of which discontinued upon stopping usage.  Withdrawal symptoms included vomiting, dizziness, confusion (at work), and a light head feeling.  The drug did alright while I was on it but the negative effects it caused in me didn't come close to outweighing the positive effects.

It does take away the anxiety, but I have a lot of side effects - my sex drive has decreased dramatically (not good for my marriage), I've gained about 15 pounds and am heavier than ever and I sweat a lot which is terribly embarrassing and annoying.  I have been going off the medicine gradually (tried going off cold turkey but that was painful - brain shocks and headaches that were scary).  Yaz has helped my mood swings and regular exercise has been great for my anxiety attacks.  I also know that eating healthy food helps me tremendously.

Prior to starting the med, I was very stressed and close to depression. The main symptom I was experiencing was extreme muscle pain in my neck and shoulders along with tension headaches that would make me nauseous. I would also sometimes have panic-like symptoms, such as fast heart rate and sweating in some circumstances. Taking Lexapro was like NIGHT AND DAY. It made me feel less irritable, calm, and care-free without that ""flat affect"" feel of some other meds. Most of all, it reduced my muscle pain dramatically. The heavy cost of the med is completely worth it. Substitutions like Celexa (Citalopram) have side effects like weight gain and are not as effective. Lexapro is a great option for those that are physically stressed and need a pill to feel normal again. I stopped taking Lexapro when I felt ready (approx. 2 years later) and do not feel dependent at all. Make sure you  follow doctor's orders and wean yourself off it slowly. "

My pychiatrist said lexapro works well for that.  when i first took, there were no real differences.  I was more outgoing so I guess the depression part worked. I woul still get anxious in social situations but I could handle it alot0  better. what was interester though was that I kept waking up at night. I got a sleep study done and they found i awoke 20 times during REM sleep, DR said it's not normal because at that stage the body is paralyzed, He thought the Lexapro was causing the disruptions....so if anyone has problems staying asleep at night, talk to your doctor because I would be fallin asleep at my desk since I would wake up at least 5 different times through out the night....

I gained about 21 pounds on it in about 4 months which is very disappointing. I quit taking it because my anxiety levels just were not chaning at all. I would not recommend quitting cold turkey because the withdrawl is not fun. Extreme dizziness and moments where I feel like I have absolutely no idea where I am or what I'm doing there- it's literally like stepping into yourself after leaving your body for a few moments. My skin has also broken out severly, I don't think I've had this many blemishes on my face at one time in my entire life.

I stuggled with anxiety related stomach issues and it has almost completely relieved those issues.  I am much happier and feel like I am in more control of myself.  I am not happy about the 20 lbs.

I have also notice some of the night sweats, very slight dizzy episodes and a slight decrease in my sex drive.  Overall I am glad I started taking the 10mg almost 5 months ago.

Everyone I know says ""Lexapro has changed my life - for the better!"" No sides effects to speak of for me nor my Mom. Oh, yeah - Lexapro took my Mom from Miss Negative (couldn't stand to be with her) to the Mother I had always dreamed about.

But because of other people that I have known to take this medication I kept taking it and letting it work into my system. I didn't notice any signs of inprovement until about 3 and a half weeks. The side effects were horrid for me too! But after that 3rd week I started to defenately notice the pressure being taken off. I would recommend that if you are perscribed this medication take it for at least a month unless you have a bad reaction to it! It really has given me my life back! Just deal with the short time side effects it's so worth it!

2878$Condition: Depression$10/30/2008 6:08:22 AM$Reviewer: killme, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$2$5$I've been taking this med for two weeks (10mg). My depression and anxiety have increased in that time apart from the first couple of days in which I felt great (placebo effect perhaps), but that may be due to occurances over the last couple of weeks which would probably affect anyone adversely. I'm hoping over the next few weeks, things will improve. It's too early to make a proper judgement on the med. My anger has increased also. These may not necessarily be caused by Lexapro.

Switched to 5 mg and have been on that for almost a month and I do feel it is helping me. I used to worry about everything and while I still worry about some things, it's not like it was. I don't feel overwhelmed and frustrated like I used to. And I'm also going thru a challenging time in my life and panic attacks were happening a lot more often and it's helped that immensley. I was scared of losing myself and becoming a zombie as some have mentioned can happen on antidepressants and since this is the first time I've ever taken anything for anxiety, I was really nervous. But overall I have to say, I am pleased with Lexapro. I'm glad a I switched to the lower dosage and it's true, give your body a couple weeks to adapt, and then some of the effects go away. My side effects were dialted pupils, yawning, no appetite and extreme tiredness. Because I was so tired at first I took it at night and it did help me sleep! Anyway, I am grateful for Lexapro. I feel much better and I feel like I have a handle on my emotions.

it is never too late to start.  i began taking this at 45 and feel like i have a new lease on life.  i wish it had been available earlier.  i've not had the side effects characteristic of other drugs that i've taken that treat mood disorders.  no dry mouth, the detached feelings, or the occassional 'bad' thoughts.  

from my perspective, it has been a wonder drug.

I was a knew person after I started Lexapro. You always feel happy and content nothing bothers you any more. I think it causes a little weight gain, not sure if it's the medicine or me but, I did gain a few. I'm trying to come off of it now because I feel like I may be doing better now, I will go back on it if I start doing bad again. I started having seizures this is the reason for the Lexapro
panic attacks etc. It has been about 1 week now and i'm feeing a little lite headed and emotional again.  If you decide to come off the Lexapro do it slowly and I think you'll be fine but, speak to a Doctor first. I was told you could start and stop any time no problem by a Doctor. 
Always talk to a Doctor first before any medicine, be sure it is right for you. Glad I know it's out there for me."

It took 3 weeks to completely get off of Lexapro and I still sometimes feel the side effects of stopping."

Ask your doctor to switch you to CITALOPRAM, which is a generic drug really similar to lexapro.

The dose ws increased to 20 mg.My suicidal and homicidal thoughts went away. Nothing bothered me. I literally became numb emotionally, just like my husband.I could not cry. After the dose was raised to 20mg,I had palpitations and chest pain, pressure. I went to the Dr. He said if these symptoms returned to call. These side effects subsided.  I experienced the fatigue, it passed. The worst side effect I've had is severe joint pain. I thought I could handle it, I was afraid of my depression returning. I decreased the dose  to 10mg. This didn't reduce the joint pain and swelling.My last dose was Sept. 18.I am 61 years old. My concern is that the drug has placed me into the possibility of having permanent arthralgia, arthritis. I am very healthy and work over 40hrs/wk as an RN. Will the pain diminish?

I finally realized about 2 months ago, after ending a mentally abusive relationship, that I couldnt do it on my own. I needed help. I started taking Lexapro. I first took the 10mg and noticed an immediate change in how I felt. I then had to be bumped up to the 20mg and never looked bakc after that. This is an amazing mediacation.

Since then, I have not had that problem.  Don't get me wrong, I still deal with being sad and upset sometimes, but that is life.  Overall, this drug worked miracles for me.

I've been on it about 3 months and it started working right away. I took St. John's Wort before this, which was not strong enough. Then I took 5HTP which worked better for me. But due to some bad life stress, I needed something even stronger. Prozac worked well for me years ago, but my body became tolerant to it. I wanted to try something different. Had a few side effects with Prozac, but no side effects with Lexapro. It balances out my  moods. It is expensive though because there is no generic available in the USA and my insurance won't cover it. So eventually I may try to just go back to using 5HTP, in addition to non-medical ways to reduce stress.

The combo worked great, and the klonopin worked to combat the drowsiness.  Things changed and my anxiety decided to become monogamous with mr. depression, so they upped my dose to 20mg a day (still with the klonopin).  So, it is working...but like everyone knows, these drugs take time to build up in your system, and it takes your body even longer to stop hating them and making you sick.  I am nauseous into week 3 of the increased dose, and still dizzy all the time.  But, just as I did when first prescribed, I know it will be worth it, so I will wait.

Sexual side effects- TRUE.  Zero sex drive.

Weight gain (aside from normal fluctuations or just eating like a piggy): 13 pounds in 2 and a half years total.

Note about anxiety/panic- I was suffering from 3-5 debilitating attacks a week.  Even on my cocktail of only 10 mg of Lexapro, I had ZERO.  "

3042$Condition: Depression$9/10/2008 4:29:02 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$3$"I have been taking Lexapro for about 5 weeks.  Overall, I would say that it has definitely helped me with depression.
The main reason I am writing this is that I experienced strong anxiety, bordering on panic attacks, for the first couple of days that I was taking the drug.  My doctor was skeptical that this was possible so quickly - one of the main reasons he prescribed Lexapro specifically was due to the relatively low incidence of major side effects.  
I just want to make sure that anyone else who experiences a similar reaction initially knows that it is not just them.  The major anxiety went away for me after a couple of days.  I have had some degree of a lot of the side effects listed (dry mouth, stomach issues, some decrease in sex drive, etc.) but they have dissipated over time.
With Lexapro, counseling, and some changes that I made in my life, I have been able to go from being pretty depressed most of the time (to the degree of having borderline suicidal thoughts) to feeling fairly close to normal.
So just some encouragement that though some people may have more difficulty getting started on the drug than they are led to expect, it has been worth it in my experience."

3. In 3 months I have gained over 20 pounds. 
If you are willing to possibly give up sex, be tired most of the time and gain weight- then this is a great anti-depressant.

It is very expensive and my insurance doesn't cover the cost, so I have my doctor write a perscription for 20 mg pills (same price as 10mg) and I just take half a pill (10mg). That has cut my monthly cost in half ($40 mo instead of $80). Very difficult to stop taking....it takes months to reduce the dosage and taper off of the medication, still unpleasant."

I also take a medication for mirgaines, so I must be careful what I use. My last migraine lasted 70 days and as a result my coping skills were depleted hence the lexapro. There is a side story here, but I shant go into it. I have not experienced weight gain just the opposite I have no appetite. I have been told no wheat gluten as it will increase the chances of a migraine and I also have just recently been told I have cysts on the left side of brain that need to be removed  hence the cause of the mirgaine. When it rains it pours does it not. I am sensitive to meds so my options are limited. 
But you all are so very strong and will get through this. I have read many of your comments and what I hear from all of you is there is strength in your voices. And you share your stories here with each other so people like me come along and read them and we do. We take strength from your words and your perserverence and admire your willingness to shre with strangers. Thank you all. I wll say a prayer that all of you find hope in the sharing. 
I never join these kinds of things but I do not know what is happening to me and I feel like I am standing on the outside of the world looking in on everyone else. I have never been sick broke my neck once but I came back from that with Gods help and my friends and family. I am the strong one for others, how do I be strong for myself? God bless all of you. Be well one day at a time, Chersih you life today and now. Devorah"

Most people with GAD doesn't know what that feels like.  I had VIVID dreams yelling out but asleep, trying to get away from someone and kicking my husband (hee hee) It was all funny in the end.  This stopped and the tiredness began.  I was EXHAUSTED all the time could sleep 24/7.  We ran every blood work we could think of and finally came to the Lexapro.  I was taking 20mg then cut it to 10mg and slowly quit taking it.  The Fatigue went away.  I was so unhappy because I knew I would have to switch and loved Lexapro.  But if I can't get out of bed to care for my children there isn't much benefit.  I have been switched to Cymbalta.  I hope it is Lexapro without the severe fatigue.

No instant fix but give hope that this will be what works for me. I Like the tiredness side effect because i have trouble falling & staying asleep. Weight gain is a major concern as I have worked hard to lose and keep it off, but will continue to eat right and excercise and watch the scale. No other side effects have been experienced. Its a trade off concerning meds, but sometimes what you need to make you feel better is your attitude and constant check in with yourself, There are no instant fix me drugs out there. It all must work together but feeling less overwhelming depression is the goal to effective decision making.Important to work with your Dr. be honest and do not follow your own advice as far as how much you need or dont.You need to work together on this, their medical knowledge is what you pay for. Have tried many different drugs for depression but this one is so far so good. Hang in there.

I took 10mg, once daily.  I felt better after just 2 doses, more energy, less depressed.  The first dose caused nausea, so I took it with some juice and yogurt the second time and had no nausea.  Then the next night I woke to shortness of breath and chest pains.  After a trip to the ER, they determined I had a rare (like affects less than 1% of population) side effect of a severe panic attack.  I had never experienced anxiety to that extreme or a panic attack, so it scared the living crap out of me.  I was advised to stop taking it immediately and after 24 hours, I had no more anxiety or jittery feelings.  I feel like Lexapro would have really helped my depression if it wasn't for that side effect.  I'm apprehensive about taking anything else right now and have been trying vitamins and supplements to help with my depression.  However, I think I'll be talking with my doctor to try a different antidepressant...

I had a trauma induced depression and was recommended this to treat the depression and for anxiety. It took away the axiety alright. It also took away my sex drive, my laughter, my sadness, my happiness, my concern for others and my concern for myself. I was a complete flat line stuck in purgatory. Two of my friends had a similar experience, plus weight gain. I had NO anxiety because all of my emotions were sucked out of me. I almost drove off the road and did not even flinch! This was no way to live. I was off of meds again for another 8 months until another tragedy happened. I went on welbutrin recently and have had significant improvement in my mood and overall well being. My goal is to cope. We are supposed to experience some level of disappointment in life, so I am not sure why anyone would want that kind of fix. I just started welbutrin 2 months ago. I am very satisfied with the results. I laugh and cry, like a normal human being. Lexapro was also difficult to come off of. I had problems with my equilibrium for nearly a week.

It's even worse when there's no insurance. They say you can't put a price on staying healthy; yes you can. It's a catch 22. I'm disappointed.

Its effects have changed over the years. I started off with very vivid dreams making sleeping an adventure! I didnt mind it actually.
I went up to a max 20mg per day dose and my partner said i was a little more spaced out then, but not really noticeably. 
Im now back down to 10mg and over the last year or so have started to experience severe night sweats, im absolutely drenched in sweat and wake up most mornings feeling very tired, drained and dehydrated. I thought it may be a relation between the drug and my hormonal cycle. There seems to be some correlation between it and the time of the month.
I hate the sweats but i dont want to stop the drug because im scared of how i will cope without it.
I also see the trouble people have with other drugs, Lexapro seems to be the best available at the moment.
What im curious about is...how does the drug make you sweat more? What is the chemistry behind it? Does anyone know?"

My doctor perscribed Lexapro and I have been taking it for about 5 months now.  It has definitely helped me to sleep better, although I am starting to wonder if I need to increase my dosage because I've had trouble falling asleep recently.  I experienced a decrease in sexual pleasure when I first started taking the drug, but that has diminished.  I think it has caused me to gain about 10 pounds as well.  Overall, however, I am very satisfied with the drug.

With this medicine you can become somewhat immune to its effectiveness after time. I also had issues falling asleep and was prescribed ambien to go along with it.  Lexapro and Celexa are best suited for younger individuals, and the side effects are less severe. I would recommend this product for younger individuals but with more severe cases I would not.

Before I would just doze and be up several times throughout the night.  I was also nauseated.  I continued to take it, thinking that it would go away.  On the 3rd day I began to feel flushed and hot.  The only way to describe it is as though my entire body was on fire on the inside.  I literally lay on the cold floor, nude, to get some relief (which didn't help).  I called the ER who put me through to poison control.  I was told basically that what I experienced was not a reaction and there was nothing to do but wait it out.  2 years later, a teacher in my school had the same experience with burning after taking this drug for about 1 week.

There are days, a few a week, i feel great before I take the lexapro (12:30 every day) but 20 minutes after I take it, the mind goes all over the place.  It feels like you have to hold on to a rope while the wild mind gets anxiety, depressed, horrible thoughts, then fine about 4-5 hours later settles down.  Lexapro can turn on you.  I was a very stable person, went through 4 situations of severe emotional turmoil and it is taken over 9 months for the mind to subside, but I think Lexapro has only made it worse, I am scared to stop taking, but very scared every day to take.  I am in a good state of mind and can actually feel now that Lexapro can make me worse. Therapy and exercise might be better than really depending on Lexapro.

I had to slowly stop taking it because my doctor was afraid of dependency. The only side effect I had was that it make me sleepy which was okay because I took it right before bed each night. Since stopping it my anxiety attacks have come back, but I am better able to deal with them because while on the medicine I realized the things I was worrying about were not worth the effort. I am glad I took Lexapro but do not think I need it any longer. I would recommend it for any one with anxiety that is at a lost at what to do to get through it.

On the first day of taking my medication, I noticed a slight beneficial difference in my mood and anxiety level. As of now, I have only had 3 side effects which are insomnia, a slight lump in my throat (which may be from the antibiotic I'm taking), and increased sweating. I believe the medication is working because I don't worry as much and I feel happier than I have in a long time. Anyone else that has experienced a lump in their throat please let me know. It does not effect my breathing or anything, but it just feels kinda strange. I haven't been able to sleep the past two nights, but I was able to take a good nap. I would also like to know if anyone had trouble sleeping like I did and how long it took for the insomnia to go away. So far I would say I'm fairly satisfied with this medication now that I'm not stressing about the little things.

It ended up I switched doctors and I stayed on both a while then stopped the Lexapro because the wellb. gave me more energy.  I didn't realize over time that I'd become less able to think clearly or calmly.  I was shaking, trembling at times.  Bursts of anger and panic attacks, mad at the world and going over and over bad things that happened and really everything got to me.  I just last week returned to using the Lexapro.  Starting on 10 mg and this doctor said to go to 20 mgs.  At first I was dizzy and sort of sleepy, but I also was calmer and got things done.  I was having trouble leaving the house.  Now I get ready and go!  I can concentrate better and I'm getting so much more accomplished.  I sleep better and feel like I'm in a good mood, actually a little perky and much more outgoing.  I was on lexapro for about a year before the wellbutrin was introduced and it really helped in quitting smoking, but I now see I should have stopped the wellbutrin and stayed on my Lexapro.  It's expensive on my RX plan $50 a month but I feel convinced it is well worth it.  If anyone know when the generic will come out, let me know!!!!!  Thank you for listening!"

I hesitate to go off as I can feel the anxiety if I forget to take it. Do I stay on it forever? How do I cope with the anxiety with out it? How much more weight will I gain?

I took my son to the movies over the weekend and though I felt a little of the anxiety kicking in, I breathed through it and told myself that I'd be alright. Between that and the medicine, my son and I had a great day together!!   I'm loving Lexapro!!!  "

You definately need to be ""weened"" off of it.  Otherwise, you'll experience withdrawl symptoms, which would explain your nausea, and if you have any ""brain zaps"".  It's strongly recommended that you stop taking it slowly, rather than just stop."

I bumped up to 20mg with no change in depression.  I also have gained about 10lbs since bumping up to 20mg.  Now mind you, I work out 6 days a week, and run 3 days a week.  I shouldn't be gaining weight.  An average person might gain alot more.  ( As a woman I know we research the weight gain part of meds.) Also, lexapro is a very mild medication, and only takes the edge of MDD.  I am supposed to take stronger meds but hate the zombie and weight gain effects.  In conclusion, I am not sure if their IS ANY help for this condition.  Side effects can further the depression.

My temper and outbursts have minimized as well as my axiety.  During the first two weeks I took 1mg of Lorazepam in the evening, and 1/2mg in the morning to ease the transition into this therapy which seems to be working well.  The Lorazepam helped me to sleep at night until this medication began to work.
The most difficult side effect for me has been the morning nausea (the urge to vomit).  I discontinued the use of Lorazepam after three weeks with some insomnia and night sweats. Sexual desire has waned slightly, and arousal takes a bit longer but engaging is still as good.  I am a large man but have not experienced any weight gain but the urge to eat more frequently is there.
This therapy does work but I am not certain if this is for a lifetime.

At first the racing heart, and being unable to sleep for two weeks was unsettling. I blew up at a technician at the hospital for no good reason the second week!  Anger was not my thing before taking this drug!  I was told by the pharamacist that Celexa would be so much cheaper since it just went to a $4.00 price, but I'm not sure of the change, and my doctor ignored me when I suggested the change.  Perhaps he makes more money when he orders Lexapro?  Although my stomach calmed down some, I experienced a huge appetite, the opposite of what I was told by the doctor!  I ignore my stomach now, and I'm not as moody as I was when my stomach was always painful.  I must say though, I also seem to have developed a void of emotions.  It's like I can't even cry when it would be appropriate.  I question whether this is a temporary thing.
I'm going to continue to research this drug before taking it long term.

(years of stress or hormonal imbalance, not sure) Either way I have tried to keep my mind stable.  I felt very stable before i crashed.  
I started Lexapro 10 and it was too strong, it made me scattered, hyper mentally (no physical side effects) and I couldnt complete a chore because I couldnt think straight.  Somewhere in the middle of all this I became OCD with horrible thoughts ( i think it was panic/depression setteling in) and i fought this away.  With doctors guidance, I lowered lexapro to 5 milligrams and most days seem ok, but like today, I woke up fine exersized mentally perfect.  I took lexapro same time every day and within 15 minutes It makes me feel weird, detached, cant focus, WEIRD and not a good weird.  feel horrible.  It takes a while to wear off and I take 1/2 a lorezepam to fix what the lexapro might be doing.  I am not 100% sure about lexapro or just going natural and taking a lorezepam or 1/2 a lorezepam when panic/mind racing starts to come on.

It was bad enough to make him change to a different drug. I have known a few other people who tried this med. Now, this is in no way a scientific survey, and comes from a very small sample, but from what I have gathered from other users, it seems like this drug may work much better for women the men."

Couldn't get out of bed, sad all the time. Finally put back on Lexapro 20mg.  AMAZING.  I feel in control, strong and independent.  No panic attacks, less obessive thoughts, only sad and depressed with situations(not ""just because"".)  This medication has been a real lifesave."

My alcoholism eventually drove me to the state of severe anxiety. I began taking Paxil while I was still drinking so it really didn't work. I switched to Lex and also went to rehab at about the same time. I am now 9mo sober and still taking Lex. I believe this drug helped me through this challenge. When I read the reviews it almost looks like the people with Anxiety benefit far greater than the people with depression or greater dis-orders.

However, the insomnia, weight gain, and negative effect on my libido are unacceptable side effects and are profound indeed.  In order to get regular sleep, I had to be prescribed a sleep medication and absolutely could NOT fall asleep without it (despite many attempts); I am quite proud of a major weight loss, but, after taking Lexapro, I gained quite a bit back--absolutely unacceptable; being quite vivacious and alive, I found that while taking Lexapro, my libido had drastically declined.

But, the general consensus of the three of us is that i have characteristic (in my blood & bone, born with it) depression and anxiety. So they said: ""Go with Lexapro"". I have been on it for a little more than a month now. I think it's working. My anxiety has subsided. I used to have these feelings of loneliness, despair quite often and easily triggered. I still get anxious and lonely but not as frequently and i do not  start feeling as hopeless. The first week on this pill i could not sleep, now i can barely get out of bed in the morning. But it is a kind of nice sleepy feeling, very relaxed and comfy. Strange. I have always sweated a lot, with wet stains underarms. Now it is even worse. But, i swear, it does not bother me as much, i kind of look at it more calmly, without panicking and running to change the shirt. Funny. So, Lexapro is working for me pretty decently, but i certainly do not want to be taking it forever, and i hope to not get bad withdrawal symptoms."

The first week was a little hard to sleep and I felt dizzy especially when I was standing in one place for a long time.  I have been taking Lexapro for almost 5 months and I feel like me again.  I cannot wait to not have to take it anymore, but since I have been thrown quite a few obstacles lately, it is definitely helping the anxiety.

3319$Condition: Other$4/26/2008 11:16:05 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$My number 1 complaint has been impulsive anger, sometimes to the point where I feel like I just want to rip my skin off.  My therapist has waivered in diagnosis from Panic Disorder to Depressive Disorder-NOS, and at this point I don't know what the diagnosis is, but Lexapro has helped a great deal!  It also was a pleasant surprise to find that it has helped my bug phobia and has helped me be a little more outgoing as well.  However, I have found that I am VERY sensitive to it.  Initially starting at 5 mg and then increasing to 10 mg, I had what I would describe as mild hypo-manic episodes and then when I tried to discontinue it due to sexual side effects (anorgasmic) I experienced SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome (withdrawl).  Within days I felt like I had been hit by a truck, my entire body ached so badly I could barely get out of bed, I experienced an electric shock sensation in my brain approx. every 30 seconds, and my temper was through the roof!  So, I ended up back on Lexapro to allieviate those symptoms and to wean off it more slowly.  Months later, I came off of Lexapro with just the electric brain shock sensation (that never seemed to really go away) and after finding Wellbuitrin SR and XL ineffective, requested to add back 2.5mg of Lexapro and I'm back to feeling pretty good again.  Not as great as 5 mg, but at 2.5 mg the sexual side effects are minimalized.

I was absolutely resistent to drug treatment, tryting months of alternative therapies.  After virtually no relief I finally ""caved"" and began Lexapro as part of a multi-pronged aspproach that seems to be working: I requested a role change at my job, committed to getting more sleep & eating better, started seeing a therapist, and began Lexapro @ 10mg.  It took 6 weeks for the med to work - the panic was less frequent and less intense but still needed xanax on occasion.  After 3 months, upped dose to 20mg and I am thankful at how I am WAY better than a year ago.  One noticeable side effect - I've gained 12 lbs in the last 2-3 months (hadn't gained weight in many years before), my Dr. told me virtually unavoidable with this class of meds.  I look at it as a necessary evil - I am functioning consistently almost like my old self again.

I was going through some life changes and had some anger issues, as well as mild anxiety and just a general lack of happiness.  I went from waking up in a bad mood and getting mad atleast several times a day to getting mad twice in 6 weeks!  I actually laughed afterwards b/c it was so amazing that I had changed so much.  I am generally a much happier person, though I am experiencing some side effects.  Difficulty sleeping at night (mild insomnia), and it is quite difficult to orgasm, though my girlfriend does not complain.  Overall my sex-drive is back, at first it went down, probably from frustration in not being able to orgasm, but I have control of that now.

I started taking 10mg, along with The Patch to help me quit smoking. After a couple of weeks, and the Lexapro began to take it's full effect... I soon discovered that the two of them did not interact very well together. I ended up passing out from it. 
My Dr took me off the patch, purged my system from everything, increased my dosage to 20mg/day...
Lexapro has helped me a great deal... I am back to work, with a better attitude, no thoughts of suicide, all is going well again.
If I forget to take my meds before I go to bed (once in a while), I definitely can feel it. Or if I forget to call in my perscription and I'm off of the meds for a couple of days, I start getting the chest pains, become very agitated, irritable, and I begin to feel depressed again. So I do recommend Lexapro, and I do recommend that you don't forget to fill your perscription. If it helps you and you see and feel that it has improved you... and made you feel better than what you were feeling before you started taking it... keep taking Lexapro as a maintenance. It really does work.

I hope this helped. "

It should be taken off the market. ANY drug that elevates your seratoin will also drop you hard. Ask ANYONE who's come off it. 
40+ years ago, My brother was unwittenly addicted. He kicked that habit after going to Hell and back, swearing never again to replay that part of his life. However, recently he was involved in a near Death experience (roll-over accident), because of his inability to get back behind a wheel of a car, his Dr. prescribed him Lex. to help with the anixeity. The first month he was great! The end of the second month, his greatest nightmare RETURNED and has been ever since. 
This stuff is worst then any narcotic. I am not lying. I am talking from experience. 
I am really mad at his Dr. for prescribing this to him, without informing him of it's severe addictive powers. He now gets to deal with the sleepless nights, twitching, night sweats, nightmares, no energy, etc.; because of his Dr's lack of knowledge of medicines. This is a repeat of 40 years ago, when Doctors got a very young boy addicted, after an accident. Then after his families insurance ran out-they deemed him cured. Although, they forgot all about to un-addict him, during the process.
Please, Please be ware!!! This stuff is like playing with Fire, you will get burned! "

Within 4 days I landed in the ER with a diagnosis of ""acute drug reaction Lexapro"" and they were peeling me off the ceiling.  Never before did I have such horrible thoughts... of homicide, suicide, insanity or unreality.  These neurologists should have had their licenses pulled, and this drug should never be prscribed unless by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist and only after proper testing and full evaluation for 'depression'.  I've never been depressed a day in my life, thank goodness, and I'll never again accept an anti-depressant from any so-called 'doctor'.  This drug caused me the scariest incident of my entire half-century of living..."

Before lexapro, out of nowhere I had a breakdown from stress or hormones, not sure, but I was a mess. Very severe anxiety, disorented, thoughts turned scary obsessive.  The beginning of lexapro at 5mg  ok, and then 10mg was too strong (taliing very,very fast etc. like severe caffine)  Lowered to 5 and I'm doing great.  I sometimes feel weird/not like myself, and feels due to the medication.  It can put you in a manic (fast) state of mind.  The anxiety has subsided, but I am afraid to travel far from my doctors because I worry that the drug will flip me out a little.  Exersize is excellent, Lorezepam is excellent just in case and deep breathing great as well.
SIDE EFFECT:  For the entire time, there is a low buzzing/like a radio frequency/ringing that I can hear in the am while waking up and middile of night when up from sleeping (can hear when its quiet)  Doctor not sure, pharmacist not sure.  Blood pressure and physically all tests fine.  "

Yes, it helped my anxiety and panic. I am a loving, sweet person and having a outgoing personality.  Lexapro made me have extreme mood swings and I became VERY hostile.  I actually, bought a book on ""Anger Management"".  I felt like I had no control over my actions and it was not a way to live.  My husband called me ""PITBULL"", because of my out of control aggression. It was a horrible six months!!  I finally came of Lexapro and I am back to being the sweet, kind, gentle individual, I use to be.  Now, I am on Cymbalta and it really works for the panic attacks.

Was doing 20mg, then 10mg after side effects became unbearable.  Lex does help even things out emotionally, and sometimes to excess, but oh the side effects!!  I had insomnia, weight gain, jaw clenching, excessive yawning and tiredness, almost no sex drive, and a jittery buzzy feeling.  I also enjoy a glass of wine or beer, but not with Lex.  More than 2 glasses and I get a head splitting migraine.  I don't know what's worse - feeling depressed and anxious or physically feeling like crap.  I was hoping the 10mg dose would help.  I stopped taking it and feel fine physically, but now I'm irritable and have the anxiety again.  Or maybe it's just I have too much stress right now?  I'm thinking of seeing how it goes for the next couple weeks after stressful stuff is over.  If I still feel anxiety, I may try 1/2 the 10mg pill to see if I can even out the feelings and not have the terrible side affects.

My ob-gyn decided that I need to try 10 mg, and it has made me feel so much better.  The first few weeks, I felt very dizzy and tired.  I also had some headaches.  These side effects subsided after a few weeks.  Now, 3 years later, I am still on 10mg and doing great.

After a couple of hours, I became very tense to the point where my lower back began aching. Near the end of the day, I was so awake I couldn't sleep ALL night, even after I took a sleeping pill.

I have been on 5 mg/day for 4 years to treat anxiety disorder. I had panic attacks since age 3, then anxiety disorder since 14. I had been entirely resistant to taking medication to treat my anxiety, but after being diagnosed with PTSS (after a near-fatal car accident in my family) my doctor said I really should give this new drug a try. It doesn't take away the consciousness of being anxious or worried for me, but does take away the physical symptoms of anxiety and allows me to deal with it so much better. I went from being afraid of leaving my house to moving alone to Scotland and traveling the U.S. for work. I suggest this drug as an option for anyone struggling with consistent anxiety (not just ""being stressed""). It's not for everyone, and I would suggest starting with a low dose first to see how that does, especially if you're as resistant to going on drug treatment as I was."

For Lexapro, my dr. started me on 10 mg, to be increased to 20 mg after 10 days. I took 10 mg for 10 days before stopping. I stopped because I had tremors throughout my body (face, tongue, hands, arms, legs) and mucous diarrhea from day 7-10, as well as increased overall anxiety and panic attacks that were worse than the original anxiety. It has been 5 weeks since I stopped Lexapro, and I now take half a .25 mg Xanax every 2-3 days as needed(at first it was every day). I also have been exercising at least 3 times a week.

3392$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/23/2008 3:24:29 AM$Reviewer: Birmingham, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$2$1$"I started taking Lexapro for General Anxiety Disorder, most recently manifested in roller coaster blood pressure (varying between 180/110 and 95/65 within the same day in spite of BP medication), and the fluctuations causing debiliting vertigo. In the past I have also suffered from panic attacks, migraines, irratible bowel syndrome, stomach ulcers, etc. -- thus the diagnosis of GAO. 

I was unable to tolerate the full dosage of 20 mg of Lexapro, due to continued feelings of anxiety, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, and a general feeling of ""weirdness"" or ""unrealness"", even though I was taking clonzipene to offset those symptoms.

After 4 months, my doctor finally decided I was too sensitive to Lexapro to take 20 mg and reduced me to 10 mg, as well as prescribing Ambien to help with sleep and nightmares/anxiety dreams.

After another 4 months at 10 mg, I finally feel like a normal person again.  Blood pressure is stabilized, allowing reduction in BP medication.  Feeling of ""weirdness"" has disappeared.  Still have some sleep problems, which I expect to continue as long as I take Lexapro (a decongestant or caffiene will keep me awake all night.)  "

Used to scream and yell a lot--I was miserable & others around, me, too! I've gained 20lbs--not good. Sleep a lot--that's o.k. I used to feel everything, like having my tentacles (octopus tentacles) stepped on. Now, they are retracted & I don't hurt near as much emotionally. I still get sad and want to cry, but I don't outwardly cry that much anymore. I still cry silently inside myself. But, overall, I do feel so much relief as compared to before taking Lexapro. I don't want to go back to being that old, mean, person.  I was irritable, aggressive, hateful, had no patience, and very talkative.  Couldn't sleep and always complaining.  Now, I'm an angel!  My boyfriend is very happy with me now.  So, the drug definitely has helped me. I'll be on it forever.

I started feeling a difference in days, and found a new balance in my life in just weeks.  Now I usually feel normal and have an occasional bad day in stead of the other way around.  The only side affect I've noticed is that it made me tired for the first couple weeks, but then my body adjusted and I don't have any noticable side affects.

It took about 5 full days for me to get used to the side effects of this drug but each day got better-less dizzy, less nauseous, less tired, etc.  The only lasting side effect is the loss of appetite.  Food sounds almost disgusting and I cant eat more than a couple bites a day, so Im surprised how many people gained weight on this one.  Ive lost it!  But Im weaker due to not eating.  I did start taking all the appropriate vitamins and suppliments after talking to several women who have been taking the same thing.  I take extra Vit D, fish oil, probiotics and a multi with iron.  I also have not had any alcohol since starting this drug.  So all in all I feel pretty great.  I have not had any panic attacks since starting this drug and I feel pretty mellow.  Im very happy with it.

AFter almost four months I put on 30lbs!  I weaned myslef off for month and a half, and during that time it caused dizziness and headaches.  I recommend for people who are depressed and have no appetite and are underweight, you will gain weight.  Panic attacks stopped, but I also quit my stressful job, so that helped as well.  Won't take any SSRIs again as Paxil put weight on me a few years back as well, I took that for 9 months and had a horrible time weaning off, I was so dizzy I could not work for a month. Now I've been off Lexapro since October 2007 and need to lose 30lbs that doesn't exactly make a person feel better.  Try something else.

The medication worked great for me in terms of easing my depression, panic attacks and irritability however it caused me to gain a tremendous amount of weight which began to cause me a great amount of frustration.  My MD added Wellbutrin to the mix which is said to help the food cravings but it did little to help me and I continued to eat uncontrollably and gain weight.   I decided to go off the medication.  At first I attempted to stop using Lexapro cold turkey.  Do not do this, the withdrawal effects are terrible and I had to go back on.  I then began a program of weaning myself off under the supervision of my MD which worked much better.

(My primary care doc says he 'doesn't understand why I'm not losing weight.') On the other hand, I don't cry at all, ever.  (I've been to two funerals for close family members and, while I certainly wanted to cry, I couldn't.) In that regard, I think that the drug has evened out the real ""lows"" of depression I used to experience, but I also think it has rather flattened my affect.  Parents and friends remark that before I started taking it, I seemed much livelier. I also have practically no sex drive since starting it.  (And I used to be a gal that really liked sex.) 

In short:
Pros: Flat affect (no mood swings) 
Cons: Weight gain, 'zombie' feeling, low libido"

So then I tried it at night and then suprizingly it made me wired. My doc told me to try a half of a 10 mg tab in the AM to taper onto this med. It worked better but then when I was to try the full 10 mg again it made me extreamly tired again, not to mention the weight gain and wanting to eat everything in sight. I started Zoloft tonight.

I was so anxious, I couldn't function. It took 4-6 days to get into my system. Some of the side effects I've had are hot flashes (similar to taking Niacin) and low libodo. I am emotionally flat most of the time, and I do get frustrated/angry easier. My patience is much lower than before, but considering the alternative, this is all acceptable. I have gone off this med 2-3 times. By myself, and with medical advice. It was very difficult each time. I had relapses every time. So I plan on taking it for the long run. I hope it will work for you as well.

I was on it 4yrs as I said it was great at first it just didn't last.
3441$Condition: Depression$3/4/2008 3:40:06 PM$Reviewer: Anonymous1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$1$This drug does have side effects that can be quite difficult for some.  I had frequent headaches and dizziness.  The side effects way out did any minor benefits of the drug. Coming off of the drug was even more problematic.  It was horrid.  I was disconnected and dizzy constantly.  I almost passed out on numerous occasions.  I felt sick constantly.  I couldn't focus on anything.  It was horrible.  Even more troubling was having two doctors tell me that they had never heard of such a thing from Lexapro while my pharmacist told me the opposite.  All the research I had done listed all of the symptoms I was having and then some in coming off of the medication. I know two additionall people taking the medication that have had nothing but problems while on it and coming off of it.  I have since switched to a much more effective remedy with no side effects-5-HTP.  I have never felt better and have had absolutely no problems with taking 5-HTP.

they just upped my dosage to 20mg instead of 10 but i believe its because my birth control is starting side effects that cause high blood pressure and heart palpitations bringing on my anxiety. 
i also take xanax when i feel like im going to have an anxiety attack but the lexapro has helped so much with everything. im really glad that i found it.

Notice an increase in wanting to eat, but, can't swear that's also not from my stress. Being aware it can put on weight, I'm trying to watch my junk intake. I do notice a little bit of a fuzzy head feeling in the morning, but, I'm assuming it's part of the first two weeks in acclimating to the medicine.  So far, I am happy with it.  Much, much, MUCH better then the side effects of the Cymbalta.  My hope is not to be on this long term, and I will definitely take my time weaning from this med, after reading the many posts.

Suicide was not one of the reasons for it. However,  I noticed a considerable increase in ideation. I have not gained any weight.  I sweat like I am in the Bahamas everyday weather it is freezing cold outside or not.  I seem to be more depressed, lazy and have more anxiety than ever before.  I now have changed my doc and will change meds too.  The sexual side effects really bother me, mostly because I can not achieve a full peak.  Sex is not normally a big issue for me but when I want to feel that release and can't that really effects my husband's manhood.  One last thing about this, I truly believe that I have been going through the change of life because of this medication and at 31 I should be at the best part of my life.

After that dosage didn't help much, my dosage was increased to 20 mgs.  I did notice it worked at first, but then I started getting worse.  The depression became more severe, so severe I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed or want to be around anyone and my anxiety turned into frequent panic attacks.

This has all happened in the span of a year and I go back to the doctor this week to change medications.  There wasn't many horrible side effects, but I did notice that after never suffering from acne in my 30 years of life, my face was constantly horribly broken out.  I also put on some weight that I couldn't lose, I found that I was angry & mean at some moments for no reason, and my sex drive decreased.

Overall, I don't recommend this medication because it didn't work for me, but others may have luck with it."

Spent 8 days in the hospital a few weeks ago due to sudden onset of severe depression.  While hospitalized, I had to work up to 50 mg of Lexapro to stabilize (highest dosage I've seen posted).  I've been in group therapy about 3 weeks now.  After about a week on the medication, I started having some nervous shaking, teeth chattering, and one MAJOR panic attack.  Doctor put me on some Klonopin and that took care of the anxiety effects.  Overall I am doing much better considering I was in the hospital 3 weeks ago and am now at home (though going to group therapy daily on short term disability).  One bad side effect of Lexapro for me (being a male) is sexual dysfunction.  But, from what I read online, that is a ""common and known"" issue.  To describe the problem in ""kind words""... let's just say the bomber can take off and fly the mission, but can't deliver the payload.  I know that may still be too graphic for some, but I tried to be polite about it.  I hope the doctor slowly tapers my dosage back and that issue gradually goes away.  But, for now, I will take it as an acceptable trade-off compared to being hospitalized with depression and feeling there was nothing to live for (though I have a great life going!).  Good luck to all you fellow Lexapro-ers out there.  Hang in there everyone.  Depression is what is bad, WE ARE ALL GOOD PEOPLE.  We will get better in time.  Take care!"

ANYWAY - the point is that Lexipro is a wonderful thing for some of us, and if your MD recommends it...give it a chance.  I don't feel ""different"", I just feel like the me that could not seem to make it out without a little help."

   i stopped taking it so much because even though i would take it everyday, i would still get those random moments of pi**ed off, i would get violently angry in split seconds. now that i'm off it i only have muscle ache, drowsiness, you know, the normal depression symtoms. as for my anxiety i only take lexapro when i'm nervous and i'm doing alright with that."

[he was fine.] they switched me to celexa (a cousin drug) and had nausea and vomiting every day for a month before i boycotted that stuff too.  Behavioral therapy helped me after that, plus being re-diagnosed with PreMentsrual Dysphoric Disorder which the psych docs didn't think to evaluate me for even tho it has coordinating symptoms. now take birth control to alleviate symptoms caused by hormone fluctuations, not serotonin problems like they had thought. i would not recommend lexapro to anyone. i think i almost died."

I took Lexapro for symptoms that were related to anger, lack of interest, depression related. I have taken a variety of different depression meds over the last 10 years but had stopped about 2 years ago as I felt that i had plateaued. I was given this med by my OBGYN. Started on 10mg, after about 3 weeks increased to 20. At first I felt an immediate response at 10mg, however I still felt very sad, so I asked for an increase in dosage. Again, almost instantly the med incease kicked in and although the depression was pretty much gone, so was everything else. such as, any energy, I was sleeping much to much, I was happy not to be so angry or sad, but well aware that I felt lethargic and very bla. At 8 weeks I saw my obgyn and explained my concerns and symptoms, it was agreed that having no energy, flat-line personality, and a weight gain of almost 10-15lbs was not worth this particular med. The weight gain flipped me out as I was already over my limit, having no energy kept me from wanting to get off the couch, having a ""who cares"" attitude didn't help either. My very big concern is on the flip side of all of the negatives is that I was very calm and mellow, making me a very easy person to be around, my family reacted to this part of the treatment with me so well. I am disapointed that I am not able to continue this med for that reason. My Dr. suggested that I take the med when I feel an episode of overwhelming sadness or anger related to my periods - mostly what took me to this in the first place...  I felt that there was no happy medium with Lexapro. I am off it completely now, I am clear headed, have not felt as depressed and have started to walk every day and work back into a healthy full excercise and diet regimine again, I am also being very mindful of my inner thoughts and moods more so that I can not be as reactive towards my family.  Lexapro was weight gain, sleepy, no interest in anything, inc sex."

Initially I was prescribed 10mg, then 20mg, and finally, 30mg.  I was on 30mg for almost a year, but I noticed no change in my anxiety/depression.  Despite the very high dose, it just didn't seem to work.  Perhaps that was because I didn't have much anxiety in the first place, or perhaps I wasn't that depressed, but nevertheless, it just did not work for me.  Getting off of it was easy; I would advise (to be on the safe side) decreasing the dosage by 5mg at a time (for maybe a week or two), then repeat until you hit 0.  Although I am not a psychiatrist, I have heard (anecdotally) that Zoloft is a superior anti-depressant/anxiolytic.  Zoloft also works for OCD, I believe.  I would talk to your physician (and do some research) before starting on Lexapro...you may find that Zoloft is superior for your symptoms.

Worked ok , but I lost my sex drive and I also couldn't orgasm anymore. So I got off of it and I was doing ok until stressful situations came up and I seemed to go back into depression but a much harder one, I got so bad that I had suicidal thoughts and am now back on lexapro , 10mg for now, it's the second day and I feel better. Not crying everyday and stress doesn't hurt so bad. But I don't like that my sex drive is totally gone. Not sure about weight gain as of yet, so I will be watching out for that.

Along with a prescription for Xanax, he gave me some sample packets of Lexapro to be taken once daily.  On the second day I began to experience moderate muscle pain and night sweats (no fever) ..   3 days was enough and I stopped taking.   Took two more days for my system to get back to normal.   In talking with other people about this, it seems that doctors now are pushing these antidepressant meds off on patients with anxiety problems (for whatever reason) and equating it with depression, giving you free samples of  powerful antidepressants from your friendly pharmaceutical company.   I feel like a guinea pig rather than a patient.
Rest assured my doctor is going to get an earful when I see him next.
My advice is to be very careful when taking these antidepressant meds.  They results are not always positive and they are powerful.  Be careful and use common sense about how you are feeling.  It is your health, and your body, and it seems pushing drugs for the pharmaceutical industry is getting more mainstream in patient treatment."

One mood swing too many and a thrown glass too many-two pets dying slow deaths three homes in two years,a military wife,daughter graduating and going from high school to college,proms,driving her everywher and teaching her to drive, knee surgery and septic infection from glass on a lake---------New home with sewage line break times three and broken custom tub flooding den and frying computer!  And dealing with it all???????? PRICELESS!  These are all stress ?  There is tons more but enough.  Lexapro has numned my anxiety and myself at times. I have vivid nightmares, significant memory loss moments, no appetite to ravenous appetite episodes,dizziness,sleepiness,sex suppression -----. However my overall mood is vastly improved. I can handle whatever comes next------I hope.  Cymbalta was the worst for me and Paxil did nothing.Xanax was temporary.  Lexapro  so far a mind saver.

For this, it has worked quite well for me.  Stressfull situations no longer cause any 'panic/anger' response.  Taken 3 years (I divide 20mg tablets to 10mg to save money - same price - double the pills).  No sexual side-effects noticed (not like under CELEXA which I previously took for 1 year).  Some weight gain noticed, but it coincides with me getting older, so it is hard to tell if it Lexapro or not).

I should of done some investigating.  I told my doctor I wasn't sleeping well and was somewhat unhappy with what happened to me time after having 2 kids close together.  It is called life....I should of listened to my instinct and waited to get more me time than letting my dr. put me on meds.  I specifically said I didn't want to gain weight and I enjoyed my sex life and didn't want any interference.  Unfortunately, I let him talk me into it and continued with it til now.  I have since gained at least 20 lbs. and have a harder time orgasming. The weight gain has not helped my self confidence either.  I started weening myself off the meds slowly and will try to deal with the side effects - dizziness, nausea, memory issues both on and getting off meds.  I have since been able to join a gym which my kids also enjoy going to.  That is how I used to be - very active.  I just had to be patient until my kids were a little older to allow more time for me.  Again, I should of listened to my instinct, not cover up everyday issues of a new mom with medication.  Some people need extra help with all kinds of issues.  I just think my doctor was quick with prescribing without understanding my background.  Too quick to line the pockets of drug companies.  There are way too many people on meds that might really not need it.  I am not discounting some real mental issues that need meds.  I used to work with a psychiatrist and do believe many do need meds.  I just would recommend investigating the meds and getting a couple of opinions if possible.  I just cannot wait to get off this med.  Good luck to those of you on it.

Gained just a little weight.  With lexapro I have absolutely no sex drive.  I want to go off of it because of that.  I'm afraid to go off because I'm think I'll have the same experience as I had going off paxil.  I felt dizzy, couldn't stand up, couldn't drive, etc.  I would love to go on something else, but I'm afraid they all have the same side effects as the paxil and lexapro.
3587$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/20/2008 7:52:58 AM$Reviewer: Aktta, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$Hi! I'm 16 and I have been on this medicine for a few months to treat my social anxiety and depression. The medicine helps a lot with depression and it has improved my depression by about 80%! However, this medicine barely helped with my anxiety. It helps specifically with being happier, more optimistic, and more calm in nervous situations. But overall, it has only improved my anxiety only by about 25%. The side effects are definitely noticeable too. I experienced trouble sleeping, weird dreams (especially nightmares), and low energy. I also had alittle nausea the first time I took it and yawn a lot. Please try to make sure you eat something when you take it, I think it helps. I think overall that I am going to discontinue my use, because the side effects are so great and it didn't help much w/ anxiety, which was the main reason I started taking it. But I still think if you are considering taking it, you should give it a try- results vary so it may work better for you then it did for me. I think you should definitely try it if your problem is depression, because I think it works best for depression- but most people have side effects so you should know although it alleviates depression symptoms, it will probably give you new ones from the side effects. I hope my review helps all of you! =)

I was started on lexapro to get me over the hump and it work amazingly.  Despite how amazing this drug is at treating symptoms, it also comes with a lot of baggage.  When I first started the medicine, I was manic for about 2 weeks, not sleeping, singing all the time, pacing  .. etc.  After all that goodness wore off, I had no sexual appetite and when I did couldn't finish.  After I self dc'd the med (as a sexual relationship is very important), I even tapered off (I know better then to just stop) I was so dizzy I couldn't stand, sit, drive do anything!!!

I felt like I could go up to any one and talk to them...and when I was around obviously mentally ill people...(homeless schizophernic people)  I felt like my mind would go where thier mind was...to a scary place, and felt unsafe...so I would avoid places like Venice Beach, where there are a lot of ""strange"" characters.

Trust me they all stop working sooner or later for those of us who need to always be on meds.  I have been taking Lexapro for about a year now in combination with three other drugs.  I has helped me tremendously up till now by giving me energy.  Yes energy.  I take Cymbalta, Seroquel, Triliptal and Lexapro.  I did have some side affects in the beginning but went away in weeks. My shrink has upped the dose once so far.  I believe I need it changed again and checked on here to find out what size of a dose people usually take and how well it works for them.  Hmm my suggestion to anyone reading this is to make sure you go to a shrink and not just a family doctor if you suffer from anything other than just a bout of situational depression.  These drugs all work so different on each of us.  I am an ""older"" person who lives alone and gee at times I wish it did slow down my sex drive but suppose I am fortunate that I have never experienced that with this or any of the other.  It is also the most expensive of all the drugs I take but so far it has been worth it.  I had terrible withdrawl symptoms from my Paxil but I do everything under my doctors advisement.  Never, never do I play with my meds.  "

Decided to give lexapro a try because it listed less side effects. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I couldn't sleep, my anxiety/panic attacks became more frequent, I became irritable, grouchy, nervous and on edge all the time. My appetite became non existent, I was staying so very sick to my stomach and could not eat. I also developed horrible heartburn that would not go away. I was dizzy and off balance. My doctor switched me back to paxil and ALL of these side effects have subsided. My attacks are now almost non existent, my nerves have calmed down, the heart burn is gone, I can eat and sleep very well now. I would suggest that anyone who is considering the use of this medication to be very careful.

My appetite was completely nonexistent, and I am thin.  I could only eat a few bites then I was full.  I suffered from hyperventilation and ultimately hypomania.  I have never had a good experience with an antidepressant and  Lexapro only confirmed their toxicity to my physical health.

Only the stable, happy, positive me--all of the time.

That made me very reluctant to try them. I have been in therapy for months,suffering from major depression and anxiety, was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, and still didn't want to take the drugs.  But I have three children who need me, and it reached the point I would try anything.  Thank Goddess I did. After a matter of days, I feel like I have my life back.  I can think, I can feel, I can simply be happy!
Lexapro hasn't made my problems go away; it has returned me to a state of mind where I can deal with them.  Very slight stomach upset the first night.  Some people have more severe reactions.  But I must say, don't be afraid of trying these types of medication. They can make the difference of a lifetime! "

Upon realizing that I was taking Serzone, the new doctor said, ""We have to get you off the serzone."" He started weaning me off gradually. Then prescribed Lexapro. After taking it for about 4 years, I still thank God daily for the Lexapro. Before Lexapro, I laid in bed with no will to live or sat in my recliner doing nothing. I had no interest in anything. About 3 or 4 months after starting Lexapro, my usually unobservant son-in-law remarked that I seemed to be a different person from when he was worried about me at Thanksgiving. I now have gotten on with living doing volunteer work with the elderly in nursing homes, having grandchildren over regularly with big celebrations on holidays with as many as 22 in my home. I highly recommend Lexapro. I never want to be without it."

It slowed it from 150 down to 79. However, I had a spell that appeared to be a heart problem and the er doctor, after he saw I was on lexapro refused to do the heart test my doctor had ordered and put me on a valium drip, saying all I had was an anxiety attack.  He sent me home with a pulse of 120, which I had for 3 days.  I went to a heart doctor who said the attack did not sound like anxiety to him.  He found I've had an electrical problem with my heart all of my life that causes my periodic rapid heartbeat and probably caused the attack that sent me to the er. I've stopped the lexapro and now am undergoing mild depression symptoms which are getting better each day. Prior to being on the lexapro I had no anxiety attacks, but while on it I had several of what appeared to be anxiety attacks and had to take valium to help the sypmtoms.  I also had a huge increase in migraine headaches and migraine auras.  My family doctor told me the new problems were imaginary, but they have improved since I stopped the lexapro.

And I have to admit that it helps me with my depression symptoms. For some people like me who was born with chemical disbalance and suffered from depression and anxiety since childhood it is a really powerfull drug. I see everything differently now than I used when I was depressed. But....there are some side effects that I connect with the drug. I always feel very tired and I can sleep up to 15 hours a day, which is not really helping my relationship with my boyfriend and my lifestyle. I still have some anxiety epizodes and experience a shortness of breath. Occasionaly I take Atarax for my panic attacks... But considering what this med has done for me these things are pretty minor.

I slept about 20 hours straight about once a week or I slept 14 hours every night. This also occured when my dose was moved up from 20 mL to 40mL.I was, before it, a self harmer. Probably once every other day, about a month after I was able to stop completely though this doesn't always happen. It sometimes made my head spin a little and I was often dizzy, though that is possibly just me. The other thing is I had severe withdrawal reactions. To be honest i felt like i had an axe in my head. My best advice with that is don't drive, don't take any of your thoughts seriously, and likely if you call a pharmacy they will give you two if you can't get through the weekend (i discovered this and it was a lifesaver). Most people apparently do not have this problem. It also works very very well along with concerta. It is a very good drug for what it does just doesn't match up with my body chemistry.  I suggest it and if you can't afford it's price Celexa works as well it just is missing an anti-anxiety affect.

I was hesitant to take a medication thinking that I shouldn't be depressed because things in life weren't so bad. However, I feel much more like myself than I have in some time. I'm resting better at night and feel more awake and engaged during the day. My only complaint with the Lexapro was the regular bouts of diarrhea I experienced. Were it not for this side effect, I would consider it a complete blessing.

I had slight balance and nausea issues and feeling as though I was dropping in a elevator at random events. My responsiblities have changed again and the stress has returned along w/ the old symptoms of being angry and edgy all the time. It is symtomatic of the position as my coworkers are all under the same stress and half of them are flipping out! The rest are burnt out... I can't flee or fight the changes as I need to keep my position and as the company is paying for it I will finish my education. I will be speaking w/ my Doctor next week to get put on a 10 mg dose as the stress level will be managable w/ this increment.

Also, be sure that no other family members have had problems with this drug before starting it.

3743$Condition: Depression$12/7/2007 10:59:47 PM$Reviewer: Akiko, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I couldn't achieve an orgasm with this medication.  I was ALWAYS tired, sometimes on the weekend, it would take me forever just to get out of bed. I was always yawning, I would take little nap breaks at work and I would never do that! Even though I had 8-10 hours of sleep, I always felt that wasn't good enough.    I was also bitchy...  It did nothing for my depression. For my social anxiety disorder, that helped, in that sense I felt more confident in talking to people but if you got on my bad side, then oh well... you know the rest, lol  I was also hostile to my therapist and accused her of not supporting me!  I told my doc who was doing med management for me what was happening to me and he says, okay we'll put you on Wellbutrin.  Mind you, before I was taking Lexapro, I was taking Paxil CR (now that was a totally different story).  With Wellbutrin, I can get up from my bed, clean the house and actually function as a normal human.  I find myself looking at life a little different. I'm currently on the 150 mg and later will be on the 350 (I think but too lazy to look at the bottle in the bathroom, lol)..  I will write later and let you know how the higher dosage works compared to the 150 - but see the Wellbutrin reviews.  It does make me thirsty, so thats a good thing, I also have my libido back as well as my earth shattering orgasm, yippee!  Depression is gone, I am always smiling and my eyes look alert.  Bottom line, Lexapro did jack for me. If you like sleeping, looking tired, sweat alot, bitchy and hostile, the inability not to have an orgasm, have a low libido, I say go for Lexapro.  If not, have your doc put you on Wellbutrin.

Normally optimistic, after suffering a bout of insomnia - he became withdrawn and zombie-like. He hid despairing thoughts, and wrote a suicide note 5 days after taking this drug. Three weeks later he killed himself at the age of 58. He had everything to live for and was the last personality type who would commit suicide. This drug can be a killer for certain individuals, especially if they are do not fall into a typical depressed category. His doctor gave him samples ""to help him sleep"". DO NOT LET ANYONE YOU KNOW TAKE THIS DRUG WITHOUT THE CLOSE ATTENTION OF A PSYCHIATRIST. OFTEN PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY MEN, WILL LIE OR HIDE SUICIDAL IMPULSES EVEN WHEN ASKED DIRECTLY (AS I DID). I watched my husband for any signs of suicidal ideation, and there were none. He hid it all. I disliked the zombie quality he was exhitibiting, but I knew that the medicine claims to need weeks to begin to work. THE FACT IS THIS MEDICINE CAN TAKE ONLY 3-5 DAYS TO TURN THE BRAIN CHEMISTRY AROUND TO SUICIDE....My advice: Don't let anyone you know take this drug - there are so many other antidepressants out there with less risk. Lexapro is being pushed as ""safe"" but hundreds of people have committed suicide out of the blue on it. History will record Lexapro as being one of the worst offenders in pandering this drug as safe, when it is clearly not. Sample packages are still being given out casually all over the country. BEWARE THIS DRUG."

Lexapro 15 mg per day. (Previously on Celexa.) Lexapro has lost a lot of efficacy with time. Weight gain, despite claims this is not an issue. Effectiveness as an anti-anxiety agent variable (I also take Xanax). Muscle pain has become a problem. Diminished libido from the start. Some blunting of affect. A big advantage for me, though, is that I am sensitive to meds, and Lexapro is one of the best-tolerated of the SSRIs. I'm hopeful that supplementation with another med, and/or tweaking the dose, will restore the beneficial effects for me.

I began lashing out physically and hit rock bottom one night and punched a hole in the wall.  That's when I went to see my doctor and told her about the symptoms I had been having.  She diagnosed me with depression and prescribed Lexapro.  It's really worked well for me.  My family no longer has to walk on eggshells around me, fearing that I'm going to either explode or break down at any moment.

My new Dr. Had been trying to get me to try Lexapro change is not something I like, however after not being able to handle the panic attaks and being sick and tired of them I was willing to give it a try, it has all but stopped them, I take 40 mgs everyday, and am ready to drop down to 20 mgs per day. I have still had some set backs with the Bi/polar area but being aware and and educated has had some benifits.I cannot do it all @ once but I am trying. If you suffer from panic attacks please give this a try and @ least 30 to 45 days of medication, you will be happy you did, and you wont have to suffer for as long as I let myself(seven and a half years is to long to be stupid and not take chances) Glad I did in Tn.

In the past I tried Paxil and Prozac and did terrible on both. Lexapro basically saved my life. I do remember when I started the medicine I would have extremely vivid dreams at night that didn't make sense and it took a few months for that to subside. One downside of the medicine is that I gained a TREMENDOUS amount of weight; I'm only 5'1"", used to always weigh around 115/118 lbs, and I ballooned up 144 lbs. The drug manufacturer doesn't state weight gain as a side effect, but everyone I know who has been on the medicine has stated the same thing. I religiously watched my diet and couldn't lose the weight; this is actually the reason I went off the medicine. I am in a much better place, both emotionally and mentally, than I was before starting Lexapro, but I found the weight gain to be something that made me more depressed and miserable. "

Went from 10 mg to 20 mg and have gained weight.  But I'm much better than I was.  Depression and anxiety runs in my family.

If you're stressed out, work out.  Don't let anxiety take over you!  You can change the way you think and the way you feel.  Change your situation.  It might take a couple of days before you feel ""excellent"" but believe me you will.  Talk yourself out of getting excited.  You have to say ""I feel fine"" and you will realize you do feel fine!  Pray to GOD and ask him to help you to think positive and pray about whatever is stressing you out and GOD will take that stress off of your shoulders and heal you but you have to believe.  Don't just say the words, but believe in him.  Have faith! Everything will work out, you don't have to take the medacine forever.  And when you do ween off, there is a tea not from safeway, but from a chinese shop (look it up online too) where you can go and these teas are for healing not for pleasure.  Working out has truly changed me physically and mentally.  If you don't have time to go to the gym theres so many things you can do from home, just stay encouraged and stress free.  peace and love."

I took Lexapro for a couple of years to deal with depression from a stressful job/condescending boss.  It did work, but when I stopped taking it I started getting brain jolts, zaps in my mouth, dizziness, vertigo type feeling when I would move my eyeballs, spinning when I would move my eyeballs, and I also had headaches.  It is very hard to explain the symptoms, but you know it when you are dealing with it.  I was absolutely miserable.  I didn't know what it was from and ended up at many doctor's offices thinking I had a brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, you name it.  They gave me an MRI of my brain, lots of tests, you name it.  Finally I did some of my own research on the internet and found that there a LOTS of other people that were going through the same thing.  I just had to type in the right thing in google and there it was.  There were so many people with the same problem, not only from Lexapro but other anti-depressants as well.  You would think doctors would know!These horrible things finally went away after about 6 months of torture.  I don't wish what I went through upon anybody.  I guess if you are never planning on getting off the meds then you are ok, but if it's just a temporary thing then I would recondisder.  The withdrawl symptoms are just too much.  I was also suicidal during the withdrawl.  It is out of my system now and I am clean of anything and feel much better.  If only one person reads this and listens to me it will be worth it to save them from something like this.

I have been off them now for many years until just recently when a family crisis brought me to go back on them.I've been on Lexapro for 5 weeks now and when I first started, I was really tired, could barely work, alot of yawning, jaw clinching, NEVER a problem with sex for me. Haven't seen the weight gain yet. I did notice though at about 5 weeks, on the way to work I felt very bad as if something horrible was going to happen to me. I don't know if I was trying to fight off a panic attack but I finally felt better late afternoon but it was the worst feeling in the world. Like my life was ending right before my eyes and there was nothing I could do to stop it. My girlfriend told me to call my doctor and tell him about it. Never did because the feeling subsided. The problem with me is that I get to feeling better and I get tired of the possible weight gain and ween myself off them. I'm staying on this one for now, seems to be working but is there an antidepressent out there that won't put the weight on?

Once, we discontinued the Lexapro, to see how I felt, and in a few days, my anxiety was right back, worse than ever! I started the Lexapro, again, and it was gone.
This combination works great for me...
And now that Wellbutrin comes in a once a day dose, and the Lexapro is also once a day, it's very convenient, to take, first thing in the morning, and I'm done! 
Some others I've tried in the past, had to be taken more often, and sometimes I would miss a dose... and that's scary!

Took about 6 weeks on 20mg to get relief, but still get occasional panic attack, but not obsessing about things as much.  As with all treatments, be patient for the drug to work and be sure to seek a therapist/psych-not your regular Dr.  And if the current therapist/psych does not seem to ""fit"", move on to another until you get the right one.  Again be patient and persistent.  Decreased libido, but worth it.  No weight gain.  Some lethargy.  Increased sweating.  Found out that increasing intensity of exercise helps with the anxiety.  Also helps with my minor OCD of excessive cleaning and organizing... now things are messy, but I can live with it. :-)"

Lexapro is the first antidepressant (others:elavil, norpramin, prozac, wellbutrin) which has effectively suppressed my anxiety.  I have not felt much, what I might call, joy.

However, right about the six week mark, I woke one morning to swelling in my hands and feet three times the normal size.  I could not fit into my shoes.  Also, my limbs ached terribly like I have never experienced before.  My feet hurt to walk on our hardwood floor, I could not hold a cup of coffee because my fingers ached so badly and I was bedridden for about 3 days because it was too painful to move.  Bloodwork from my doctor revealed a very rare side effect from this drug.  I was terribly disappointed since I really felt this was working for me.  My doctor has given me samples of Effexor to try instead so hopefully this will work.

It caused me to have a flat affect as noticed by a friend who didn't know I was taking anything.  Also, I had an incredible weight gain of 30 pounds in about 6 months. I experienced a lack of sex drive and also the inability to have an orgasm.  My husband was away for eight months and I wasn't interested in having sex at all.  Everything returned to normal after I stopped taking it. Lastly, coming off of this drug was shear hell.  I was so sick even though I was reducing extremely slowly.  I experienced what felt like electric shocks in my brain quite frequently.  All I wanted to do was sleep because when I slept, I didn't feel anything.  It was horrible.  I vowed never to take anything again, but recently I was convinced by another doctor to try Wellbutrin.  So far so good.

Doctors will tell you that you can come off of this med whenever you want, but they don't tell you about the hell of withdrawal effects that you'll have to suffer through in order to do so. I have been off of it for a month now and I'm going through exhausting ""electrical shock-like"" episodes almost nonstop. It's like being crually tortured! Along with the shocks, I have headaches, anxiety, and ""brain farts"". If you just want to go on something short term to get through whatever you're going through, I don't recommend this drug. It works very well and I had very few side effects, but plan on staying on it unless you want to see how tuff you really are! If you are a woman and think you might want to get pregnant within the next couple of years, think twice about going on this med or any other like it...doctors recommend coming off of them before conceiving. Look at all of your options, weigh out the good and the bad of each option before making a decision. Just do your research before going on any medication because the doctors won't tell you about how hard it is to come off of them. Good luck!"

I had been on many other anti-depressants and this is the one that has helped my depression the most.  I am on 30 mg as of just a few days ago.  I was on 20 mg.  I have had no side effects with the medication.  And they are easy to take and do what they are supposed to do.  I was put on them originally by a Psychiatrist and also recommended by my own personl Physician (Internist) who I have 100% trust and faith in.  I can't say the same for the Psyhiatrist as he only saw me for 5 minute intervals and I was out the door.  My own personal Internist can do the same prescribing and spends a lot more time with me.  I will soon be seeing a new Psychiatrist as my Doctor feels I may need a mood stabilizer.  So I don't know with that being thrown into the mix (depending on what the Psychiatrist puts me on) how it will mix with the Lexapro.  My Doctor feels I may be Bi-polar and need a certain medication like Lithium.  But that is up to the Psychiatrist.  When I was on Cymbalta 30 mg I was fine but when the original Psychiatrist prescribed the 60 mg I broke out in hives and a rash all over my body.  My lower lip swelled up and my face some.  I was in agony with that rash off and on for months.  So anyone on Cymbalta beware as this is what happened to me.  I never had one bad side effect from Lexapro.  I know a lot of others on it and they haven't either.  Lexapro is my anti-depressant choice.  And believe me I have been on at least 10 different ones.  Thank you.  Diane L.

I didn't realize how uptight I was til my husbands DR suggested I take it along with him. My husband stopped taking it due to it's sexual side effects.  I just stopped taking it due to less stress and the fact that I have gained 20 lbs in the last 5 months.  Going to see if stopping the lexapro helps me shed those pounds. If not I will definitely go back on it. Not sure if weight gain is a side effect or not.

After prompting from my family, I finally told my Dr. about my symptoms (irritability, insomnia, tension).  He prescribed Lexapro and after a week I noticed a HUGE difference.  If I had known that I would feel this good, I would have done this years ago.  It has changed my outlook, my way of thinking (I no longer worry things to death), my sleeping habits (I am able to fall asleep and stay asleep).  I highly recommend that if you are suffering from any anxiety related symptoms talk to your doctor and don't wait.

4092$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/27/2007 2:38:02 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$1$3$I would not take this medicine again. It worked pretty well for my anxiety and depression, but there were too many negative side effects. I lost interest in sex, gained weight, and got frequent headaches. I had to wean off of it when I found out I was pregnant and weaning caused me nausea, headaches, tiredness, dizziness, depression, and mood swings. Also, when I started the medicine I did not feel like myself for the first few weeks. I felt drugged up and out of it.
4093$Condition: Depression$9/27/2007 9:42:26 AM$Reviewer: fiero_lilly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$My psychiatrist diagnosed me with severe depression when I was 16 and prescribed me with 10 mg. Instantly I was experiencing severe weight loss due to a decreased appetite. I dropped to 90 lbs. My doctor stated this was normal but that the dose needed to be increased. So I took 20 mg. I still had no appetite, My body felt weightless when I walked and I experienced severe dizziness. I told my doctor and she did nothing, so I stop seeing her and stopped the medication. To me, that was certainly NOT normal!

4099$Condition: Depression$9/25/2007 3:51:34 PM$Reviewer: Dupree, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"Becoming acclimated to the ""side-effects"" occurring from use of this medication was easier with a long term mindset that it would do its job eventually.  It did.  Lexapro has been a terrific help for my feelings of depression and social anxiety.  I would have never believed it would give me the confidence to climb out of the black hole I often found myself.  The side effects are real - but they did subside for me.  The most frustrating side effect that I've had to accept is that it takes longer (sometimes frustratingly longer) to climax sexually.  Certainly I could see the beneficial aspects Lexapro would have on someone experiencing premature ejaculation issues."

4110$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/22/2007 9:46:33 PM$Reviewer:  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$I switched from paxil to lexapro due to a 20 lb weight gain.  Personally lexapro gave me severe panic attacks and changed my life for the worse.  I finally went to therapy for a year to reverse the panic which I felt was pretty ironic.  I have friends that take lexapro and love it but obviously this is not the right drug for me.

4129$Condition: Depression$9/18/2007 11:21:00 AM$Reviewer: Pocahontas, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$5$"Was on Lexapro prior to my 3rd pregnancy. Had to stop for that reason and switch to Zoloft for the gestational period. Zoloft didn't control my depression/anxiety. Following breastfeeding, psych tried me on Cymbalta which worked the first month but then made me feel suicidal (of which I have NEVER been suicidal in my life). Then, because of no insurance, psych tried Celexa trying to get a ""lexapro"" dose out of it. 

I finally gave up and demanded Lexapro back again. PostPregnancy, Lexapro is still NOT giving me the same relief of depression and anxiety as it did prior to my last pregnancy. I don't know why. I sure wish I could gain my happiness back again as before.

PrePreg: Lex was great
PostPreg: Lex is so-so"
