I got to school and was giggling with my then foster sister and all of a sudden i wasn't able to move. I had my then foster sister call my mother because the office lady didnt like me and wouldnt let us use her phone anyways my then foster sister set me in the office where i felt like i was drifting off... My mom showed up saw me first glance and rushed me to the emergency room. My heart stopped my mom was worried i was going to die. I was admitted to the hospital. I guess I had a allergic reaction and they told me if I had a stronger dosage i wouldn't have made it... Its sad that one pill can take a life. Anyways i know other people who have been on it and said they didn't like it. So 1000% wouldn't recommend.

The taste is not that bad, can't believe all the complaints. I have only been using one month but felt myself, alive, alert, happy, at day six. If this continues for me it will be my miracle drug after about 10 mishaps on other meds. Sleep is easy, dreams are amazing, not drowsy upon awakening.

My dr put me on a few different meds like risperidone, abilify, even zyprexa. The Zyprexa made me sleep 20 hours a day and I could barely function. Then we tried Saphris. Life changer! I am currently on 20mg at night and I can sleep well and wake alert and ready for the day. It puts me to sleep within an hour of taking it so definitely take it when planning to go to sleep. It has cleared my thinking, diminished the agitation and paranoia pretty well, and calmed my urges to hurt myself from the anxiety I was feeling. My dr recently changed my diagnosis to Schizoaffective because I was having some break through hallucinations even outside of a mood episode but upping the dose to 20mg has helped rid me of those for the most part. I haven't gained any weight and my appetite has remained normal. Now I have been at my current job for over a year when I was struggling to function daily before starting Saphris. I thank God that I have my life back and feel great on it along with 200mg Lamictal and 10mg Lexapro for depression. I wish the best to all who are trying this new med!

I rather like medications taken in this manner. Mine was flavored but it melts so quickly that the flavoring is a waste. I could handle the tingling but, as someone else said, waiting 10 minutes before drinking something is nearly impossible. I have noticed no difference in my non-sleep pattern; I was hoping for at least 4-5 hours of sleep but remain at my 2-3 hours. What I have noticed is that after taking Saphris I feel the way I think one must feel after going on an alcohol bender; totally drunk, bouncing off walls, and in a total mental fog that lasts for many hours.

I do this 10 minutes before I go to bed and it puts me to sleep right away and I always have a  peaceful nights sleep. It has worked very well for my bi-polar condition. I take it along with Pristiq and Vivanse. I also take Topamax. I take 5mg. of Saphris, 100mg. of Pristiq, 40mg. of Vivanse and 100mg. of Topamax. Its the perfect combination. I take 10 mg. of Saphris in the wintertime. I was suicidal years ago but no longer feel that way and no longer feel depressed or have bi-polar episodes taking these medications. I feel great. I have started walking everyday and I lost weight. I am back in the life game. I have came a very long way over the last 4 years.

Primary symptoms are depression and severe anxiety. Saphris is a wonder drug for me.  I take 20 mg at night, because it knocked me out to take it in the morning.  Anxiety is almost completely gone, and I feel like a normal person for the first time since I was diagnosed 12 years ago.
I hold the tablets under my tongue without moving and the taste isn't bad if you follow it up with a piece of chocolate.  Find I want to eat everything in sight once I take it, but since it puts me to sleep within 20 minutes, I don't stay up and eat.  During the day, it doesn't affect my appetite at all, and I've lost the weight I gained on Seroquel,"

All joy for life is gone, the way I look at everything is clouded, dark, constant thoughts of death, meaninglessness, hopelessness...going off this drug!!!

I was on Risperdal before and that made me gain 25 lbs but I have to say this medication has increased my appetite even more. It also numbs my mouth and tongue and messes with my taste buds. I've been kind of Hypo-manic since I've been taking it so my mood hasn't crashed yet, but I am going to stop taking it, a lot of the reviews on here say Saphris is great at stabilizing mood. I really wish I could stay on it to see that but I have to take care of my diabetes and blood sugars so need to find another anti-psychotic, have tried quite a few so far and haven't found a good match yet. Risperdal did work but it made me fat.

I felt good. I was sleeping and had a lot of energy that wasn't mania. I took it in the morning because I couldn't sleep after taking it; it made me feel nervous at first.  My symptoms gradually got worse until about 3 weeks after beginning Saphris I noticed that I would get restless and have trouble sitting still about 2 hours after taking the drug. Then after 5 weeks I noticed a ""fluttering"" feeling in my chest and sometimes my heart would pound and race so hard that it felt like it would jump right out of my chest.
This is a side effect that I've experienced with some other mood stabilizers (anti-pyschotics).

People complain that the bad taste Is a real drawback but I don't see why that should really matter, I don't mind the taste, I find the meds work which is what people should be talking about. This is the first stabilizer to actually work, Lamictal did nothing for me and I have suffered on it for years being uncontrolled, in terrible rapid mixed episodes. I have been on absolutely everything on the market and this is the first med I find to actually be helping me. It makes me really tired but it helps me sleep at night, a little bit of difficulty sometimes in the morning. I hope to be able to take it in the the morning in the future and I hope it doesn't knock me out.  Hopefully it keeps working and things get better and better

After 6 weeks I became depressed with anxiety. This continued and I continued to take the Saphris for ten more weeks then had an allergic reaction. (Gagging, pulling on throat, rapid heartbeat and uncontrolled shaking, all lasting 45 minutes.) So I stopped taking Saphris cold turkey. The withdrawal symptoms were very hard. Severe insomnia for 22 days. diarrhea for 7 days. Also, weeks of Cotton-dry mouth, no appetite, nervousness, nausea and rapid heartbeat. Finally, I am sleeping normal and have an appetite and feel normal after 24 days. Saphris didn't work out for me. I could not take it during the day, only 10mg at night as it made me too drowsy. I'd rather deal with my moods on my own than go through the adverse reactions of Saphris.

I was stuck in sort of a wordless prison for a second before I could make it to wherever words are kept. That went on for about an hour.

This combination works for me and it's great for sleep. I don't know how anybody could take it in the morning. I find it very sedating. The taste is yucky too. I dry the area under my tongue with a tissue before I take it and then I hold it there (no moving your tongue). This way there's less saliva coming up on the taste buds on the sides and top of my tongue.

Insist that your psych prescribe the black cherry flavored saphris.  It's still bad tasting, but is 100% better than the original. After removing the pill from the foil pack, place it in the middle area under your tongue. Avoid talking or moving your tongue for the required 10 min. This takes patience and practice. The pill will dissolve quickly causing a lot of saliva. After the 10 min., swallow the built-up saliva, immediately brush your teeth (and tongue if it bothers you), and go to bed soon after because saphris is very sedating, especially at first. If you can get past the taste, you may find it a very useful drug. I find it effective for sleep, keeping you awake during the day, depression, and stopping obsessive/suicidal thoughts. Good Luck.

For the first time in my life I feel my sleep/wake pattern has been corrected. I can get out of bed in the morning, stay awake all day and fall asleep in 15-30 min. It quiets my racing, obsessional thoughts and stops the suicidal thoughts. Now I can concentrate on talk therapy and having a life! I still have too strong of an appetite so it hasn't corrected that. I also still feel some depression, lack of drive and low energy. Psych has prescribed 10 mg. of Prozac to help me out, especially since I just lost a beloved pet. Saphris is not a magic bullet, but I find it effective with few side effects. I hope the effectiveness doesn't wear off! It works for me, but may not work for you. Don't give up and don't wait to get help. Be patient and find out what drug works for you and stay on it long enough to let it work.Good Luck!

35$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$10/19/2012 1:36:59 PM$Reviewer: jantuggy, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $3$1$3$"I began taking Saphris for mixed state bipolar disorder on 8/23/12 in order to gradually discontinue Seroquel which had lost its effectiveness in treating my depression and extreme fatigue.  I developed a euphoric renewed energy and decreased need for sleep, which I attributed to discontinuation of Seroquel, and effectiveness of Saphris, and thought my symptoms of prolonged dizziness and nausea were the result of physically adjusting to it.  After Seroquel was DC'd, the Saphris caused a increase in dizziness, pressure inside my head, nausea & fatigue, partly due to lack of sleep without Seroquel. On 10/15/12, continued usage caused an alarming pressure inside my head, which escalated to the degree that I felt like I was overdosing & was transported to my nearest E.R. I was unable to walk, make eye contact, or think clearly enough to give the medical team accurate and necessary information. 
After nearly 4 hours of unnecessary medical testing (thyroid, EKG, blood work), I was treated with an IV of Ativan for anxiety and Phenotil for nausea and released.  It was concluded that I had an allergic reaction to Saphris and was advised to discontinue it immediately. I regretted not having requested to be transported to the nearest psychiatric hospital because my symptom of pressure in the head as a result of taking Saphris would have been diagnosed much sooner.  Dizziness is a normal side effect of Saphris, and usually subsides after a few days. I strongly caution any user who develops any pressure in your head that continues to increase to reconsider or discontinue usage."

If you suffer from anxiety and/or Bi-Polar depression disorder, I recommend a combination of Saphris and Vistaril.

41$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$4/29/2012 10:46:41 PM$Reviewer: confused!!, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$5$Approx. 23 yrs ago I was diagnosed a Manic-Depressive/Bi-Polar2. I've been through the ringer as far as medications are concerned. After many years of different medications, I'm now taking Valium, Saphris & Buspar. I've only been on the Saphris for 11 days now, after months of Seroquel found to be ineffective for me. I can tolerate the numbness/tingling of my mouth as well as the nasty taste (wish that was the worst part of it). I realize that as with all meds they take time to take full affect. In the short time I've been on the 10mg dose, I'm finding that I have a very LOW tolerance for anything. I get rather irritated & have less of a tolerance for anything. I can't say for sure it's the meds but I can say I'm not usually agitated to the point of throwing things, screaming about what seems to be nothing & wanting to physically beat something or someone. This I find extremely disturbing and am unsure if it's normal & will pass or if I need to seek help. I have mixed feelings about this med. Hopefully my next visit to my Dr will help explain something. I would recommend asking about things of this nature before agreeing to take the medication.

I am also taking lexapro.  Taking this drug sublingually is a pain, mainly because it tastes horrible.  I am also convinced that this drug caused the severe panic attacks I was having, which seemed dose-dependent (I was on both 5 and 10 mg of Saphris).  Upon first taking the drug, I would get severe restless legs that would last for about 3 hours.  The drug makes me very drowsy, but it was hard to sleep with severely restless legs.  This side effect went away after about a week on the drug.  I am no longer taking this drug because I found it ineffective and could not tolerate the panic  attacks.  The attacks are pretty much gone now that I am off of the Saphris.

Started at 5mg at bedtime and after 4-days added 5mg in the morning.  While my emotional state has improved TREMEMDOUSLY, my sleep has worsened which I will discuss at my next Dr. appt.  I do, however, notice that after I take the tablet under my tongue and wait the 10-min before eating/drinking/teeth brushing, I feel physically awful.  Neasua but no vomiting, headach.  If I can sleep it off, I am ok which works for the PM dose, but the AM dose not so much as I have to work.  I've tried eating something before taking the pill as well as 15-min after with no improvement.

Has anyone else experienced this?  How did you handle it?

Thanks!"

Its slow going but I am sticking to the Atkins diet of 20 cars a days and exercising everyday 15 min. of cardio and 45 mins of yoga and i am drinking 64oz of water a day which in a large squirt bottle is quit easy. I am losing 1-2 lbs a week and my goal is one year to lose all the weight. Saphris makes me hungry but the more water i drink the more full I feel and it cleans out all of the toxins in my body so I would highly recommend my routine for anyone who is suffering with the weight gain. Best of luck

It does taste bad, but it is nothing compared to the agony/misery of this past year. Abilify worked great for me but i gained a lot of weight and i was just to whatever, so to speak. I laid around all the time.  I still feel like me on this med. I still have my passion, my sense of humor..etc. I hope it stays this way. So far so good. What a relief. I was very sedated the first few nights on 5mg. However, i am now on 10 at bedtime and it knocks me out. I might have to cut back on the trazodone i usually take for sleep. I am wondering if it will ever be possible to take one in the morning...whew..i would hate to be that messed up and try to function. I'm very happy with this med and i have renewed hope, again..!!! hang in there..never give up!

The second night I kept waking up due to restlessness...I absolutely hated the way it made me feel. I was so sleepy but could not rest. After 1 week, I'm at work crying ALL DAY and back and forth to the bathroom crying, crying and crying so much all day. Then comes the thoughts that death has to be better than living like this. My mom was livid and hated seeing me like that. I had to stay with her because she wouldn't let me go home by myself. I haven't felt a low like this in a veyr, very long time. I stopped taking it on my own. I'll never be in this again. But the black cherry flavor was better. If you ever feel like this call you're doctor immediately...I've been through the works with these meds and just ready to stop ALL of them...I am way too sensitive to these side effects. I'm tired of the up and downs with these. But I must say that the Saphris was the worst...Good luck if you're taking this...

After the first 2 days I noticed a tremendous difference in my mood. I felt great. I wasnt as depressed, I felt very calm, and actually had alot of energy. I seemed to have a peacefullness feeling.  I also have taken Depakote, Seroquel and others medications that did not work and had horrible side effects.  I was very hesitant about starting another new medication because I had taking everything and nothing seemed to work. This is like a miracle for me! I have noticed my hands and feet have swollen when I awake in the morning but it eventually goes away after a few hours once I start moving around. So far that is the only side effect.  I start on 10mg tonight. Hopefully it will still keep improving.  If everything else has failed I would definiely give this medication a try.  Within the first couple of days I could definitely tell a tremendous difference. It definitely puts me to sleep within an hour after taking it at night and I do sleep alot better.

Man was i wrong. It is officially the worst tasting medication! it even made my tounge numb for 30 min... other than that the medication is great. it has not completly taken my symptoms of bipolar away but has relieved a lot of issues i was having...

I have tried every possible anti-depressant marketed with the exception of a few. I had no choice but to retire from a 20 year career. After about a year with my new physc, trying basically all the new anti-depressants on the market, it would relieve some of the symptoms for a short period of time then nothing!! At last we thought we had found the right combination of meds to deal with my illness. I started taking Celexa, Lamactil, xanax and trazadone. That lasted for about 2 years then my symptoms came back with a vengance!! My doctor gave me samples of Saphris SL, discontinued the Celexa and cut my trazadone in half, they told me about the terrible taste so I was expecting that. I have been on the Saphris SL for about 4 weeks at bedtime and stopped the trazadone because the combination was so sedating. I would sleep for 2-3 hrs and wake up sometimes needing to go the the restroom and I couldn't even function, I could hardly hold my eyes open and my coordination was limited at best, much to my regret, I have turned into a monster! I have never been a violent person even with my illness. My family noticed the change in me after about 2 weeks of taking the medication and I am gaining weight rapidly and serious swelling all over. I did start to notice that pretty much anything anyone said to me made me angry. I blew it off as stress, but never have I experienced such aggitation before. I continued to take the medication for 2 more weeks trying to give it a fair shot. Last night to my horror I started throwing everything I could find at the wall!!!! I grabbed my car keys and off I went. Thankfully I arrived home safe., I knew it had to be the medication. Last night I quit taking it and will NEVER take it again.  I DO NOT recommend this. Please read ALL of the reviews on this medication. If it works,I wish you the best.

The taste however is terrible and is a rather unpleasant experience. Once you have been on it for 6mos-1yr you get used to it. I have been taking saphris for a while now and it has worked wonders for me. I have really bad insomnia and saphris allowed me to finally get some sleep. Before I began taking saphris I went with 20 hours sleep for a period of two week straight. 720 hours in one month. With two weeks at 20 v 336 hours you can only imagine how bad the first two months were. Saphris was a god send for my bipolar disorder I disorder.

I have been on so many combinations of meds that I can't even write them down. I have not gained weight, I lost weight. I  had episodes of psychosis and was put on saphris. Since then I feel great. The taste is horrible but I got used of it. I'd rather put up with the horrible taste than lose touch with reality again. You do get used of the taste. I have to only take it at night because it will knock me out. But that is a good thing for me. I go thru periods that I don't sleep or sleep only 2 or 3 hrs a night. I have had a great experience with saphris and love it. The best medication I have been on. I started taking it in April 2010. Its great because I'm not a huge combination of meds like in the past. I have narrowed it down to just taking saphris and topamax. Oh, I did have a period that I was really depressed but dr. put me on wellbutrin and felt a little better after that. No longer on wellbutrin. I feel great, no episodes of psychosis in 8 months, I feel stable. One thing I did notice is that if I did miss one or two doses it would effect my moods in a big way. Have to make sure you take everyday!!!

Give yourself a 6-8 hour time frame to rest. The taste is bad but so far the effects are going very well for me. I have been Bipolar for many many years and I have been on many different medications. I have trouble sleeping but when I take this before I lay down I wait the 10 minutes like I am suppose to and drink something with flavor to wash the taste away. Yes it does make my mouth under my tongue numb(where I put it) to dissolve. If you can keep it under your tongue do it. My normal reaction on first couple doses brought it above my tongue. Don't its worse tasting and makes your whole tongue numb. Then I lay down and that is all I remember for the next few hours. Don't try to do anything after taking it, Just rest. The side effects I do not have yet and may not have. I am in the time frame of my most possible manic state of the month, I do not feel that everything is 100 fold worse then it really is. I can say this is working for me. Please keep in mind when reading these reviews that most of us are in a state of saddness, moody, etc... it is why we are taking it to begin with. No medication has it full effect for at least 30-40 days. When trying this medication please give it 30-40 days before you decide on its full effect for you.

I was in a deep suicidal depression and my new psychiatrist decided to try Saphris on me. Within two days I could feel the depression lift. Just as others have reported the first three doses knock you off your feet, literally. When you wake up (especially without a full nights sleep) you almost feel like you are in a drunken state. The medication doesn't taste horrible, but it definitely is unpleasant. Your mouth goes numb, there is a lot of drool, and you can't eat or drink for 10 minutes. Definitely the worst part of my day. However, I have tried Seroquel, Depakote, Abilify, Cymbalta(made me go SUPER MANIC), Lexapro, and countless others. I'm a little over a month in and I've had to gradually increase my dose but it has worked well. The depression went away within days and hasn't came back and my rapid bursts of hypomanic/manic behavioral symptoms gradually have faded. Before Saphris I was coming off of a roller coaster that had given me 40 hours sleep in 20 days, a depression so deep I was giving up on life, and a lost faith in medication. No drug works the same for everyone but I do recommend that you at least give this one two weeks and see how it turns out. I haven't experienced any of the muscle twitches but I do have hand tremor. A little tremor is worth the sleep and stability I am getting, I just wish this drug was a little cheaper.

When I went to bed just a few minutes later I found my legs were ""jumpy"", constantly jerking keeeping me from being able to rest or sleep.

This drug has squashed the mania and psychosis, but has spurred on a depression so deeply, that I know I won't climb out unless I go off of it. I am flatlined with no emotion except overwhelming sadness. This is not me, it is the drug. As for the taste, if you're desperate enough like me, it's something you have to endure. Takes like you're sucking on codeine cough syrup, but I had high hopes and didn't care. I'm going to the doc this morning. It's that or a hospital, and that's not an option.

My spouse says I'm a grouch when I forget to take my pill by 7:30 PM.  So, far.  Taking the pill in the AM is problematic.  I and the Doctor are both waiting another month and then I will start taking the AM pill.  The initial druggyness worries me because I am a working professional and - well I do not need more problems than what I have now.  Reasoning - I was hospitialized and tried several meds.  I even took a month off from work.  With Saphris, life goes on.  Thoughts of taking my life are fading away.  The manic appears to be slowed but I need more time to adequately evaluate.  I am sorry others appear to be having problems.  A one or two time use doesn't give this drug a chance to really start working.  I am on for over two months.  Hey!  I am alive versus the alternative.

For me, the taste wasn't too bad, it did numb my mouth. But the worst was the jitteriness of my body (restless leg, & arm?). Made my body feel thick, but didn't put my brain to sleep. I've tried most of the older meds, most recently 800 mg of Seroquel XR; nothing seems to control my rapid cycling, mixed episodes for very long. But I do not recommend Saphris.

I had severe wrist pain in both wrists, headaches, neck pain, and sleep disturbances.  

I switched from Abilify to see if I could lose weight because I gained over 70 pounds on Abilify but was a normal, functioning adult.

After being diagnosed as a DIP (ha! and I have my papers), I switched back to Abilify.

I have lost countless hours and time and travel.  I was on Saphris for over six months and my pain steadily got worse.  It was excruciating.

The depakote worked, but three out of three dr's say it's causing breast milk. As if you don't feel sexy enough to gain weight and be psycho?  The saphris dissolves quickly, tastes like poo, and makes your mouth numb. However, my agitation is alot less, I have noticed some more anxiety, but that's what the xanax is for. I have noticed more joint pain than before, and the pain meds don't work as well on saprhis. How is this possible? All in all, I'm alive, and need less sleep than with depakote. I can actually wake up at a decent hour...but it's honestly more time for joint pain. BLECH

Kind of leary when Dr. prescribed this sublingual, but the difference is amazing! I HATE the taste and when it dissolves it fills my mouth with saliva as well as numbs my tongue.  I also hate having to wait ten minutes after to eat or drink. It's the worst part of my day.  However, prior to starting this medicine I was constantly thinking about suicide or attempting it, my moods were all over the place with rage, impatience, and lack of motivation and I hadn't written anything worthwhile in over a year.  I also was only getting about two hours of sleep a night.  This medication does make me drowsy so, I take it right before I go to bed and sleep like a baby, waking up pert and perky (something that's never happened until now).  No signs of depression or suicidal thoughts and I love the fact that I feel like a normal woman.  It's really been a miracle for me and even my husband has noticed. I've been on this about a week, so I hope Saphris is the one for me. So far I haven't had any negative side effects.

I would wake and remain useless and tire for an addition two hours. My behavior is far more irritable than ever before, and I find myself full of anger and wanting to pound my fists through the wall, or destroy sometime just because it was within arms reach. I find the taste of this medication absolutely repulsive. My appetite has spiraled out of control and I have gained 17 pounds in the last two months. My Diabetes is hyperglycemic with blood sugars above 200, thus requiring higher than normal insulin injections with greater CC's of insulin per injection. Finally, the copayment is prohibitive, even after insurance pays their pittance-share.

I do not reccommend this medication whatsoever. I will never try it for a third time.

I have been on saphris a little over 2 and a half months. I have continued gaining weight about 20 lbs I can account to this drug. My shrink said the norm is 4 lbs.

I guess a good number is around 100 or so. I came in at 280!!!!!!! Somehow this mixes in with the weight gain, I don't yet know all I need to know. I am being put on an aspirin regimen and also have to take a pill to help get that level down before I have a heart attack.

I switched over from Seroquel XR once a day.  To beat the bad taste use Listerine breath strip or mouth spray when you take it.  This is a Doctor approved method.  Brushing the tongue 10 min. after taking the tablet helps with the numbness of the tongue.     It gets the residual medication out of your mouth as well. 
I still get tired about 1 hour after I take it in the morning or night.  This is the same side effect I had taking Seroquel.  However Seroquel knocked me out for 10 hours at night and did not affect me during work hours.  Saphris only seems to make me really tired for about one hour.  However I seem to have difficulty keeping my mind awake from about 9:00AM to noon.  I take my pills at regular intervals: 8-9:00PM at night and 6-7:00AM in the morning."

Helps me sleep, but can't function until the dose wears off. Have taken it for two weeks and am not noticing much improvement in mania/mixed state. Side effects: (1.) after taking, tounge and throat are numb for up to an hour so I don't eat or drink because of possibility of choking, (2.) tastes terrible but the bad taste only lasts for a minute or two, (3.) Feet and ankles are swelling. My guess is this drug is probably more effective for schizophrenia than it is for bipolar.

It burns your mouth and made me want to vomit.  It better turn out to be a miracle drug for all that.
