I also maintained straight A's and graduated with honors.  It has been my miracle drug because it works for schizophrenia.  Please do not stop making it!

When I complained to my doctor and insisted I would not take it, he threw a fit! Then I learned Medicare pays $683 to the drug-maker for this poison. Apparently, my doctor needed me on this drug to pay for the mags on his Porsche. Do NOT take this poison!"

It made me think and do completely psychotic, out of character stuff. Every morning when I woke up I never knew where I was and every day I thought I was places that I cannot begin to explain. One day I didn't know where I was for about 20 minutes, but I was just sure that my ex-husband would be sitting in a chair just outside of my room. Actually there was no room outside of my door to begin with, which made that even weirder. And the fact no men lived at this facility, as it was a shelter for battered women. My ex wasn't even the one I was hiding from, as we had been divorced over a decade. Then one day I really snapped. Was paranoid and mad and scared the staff and so for the second time in 2 weeks they called in a squad of mental health professionals to deal with me. Tem minutes later I forgot the whole thing. Then approx. ten days later I did it again (whatever it was) so they called the cops and the squad people again. I was escorted by four people to the mental ward for observation and didn't know why they were acting so funny. Anyway after all the stories told to me about my behavior over the last month or so, I realized the abilify was the common denominator and stopped taking it that day I and I was fine the very next day. People who know me as a rule are never surprised at my unique behavior and roll with it. But I had become out there and was being 'socially unacceptable""   "

I stopped taking it, and continued with the lithium and saw/felt no difference at all. After I could no longer pay for the Rx, I was without meds, and to this day (this was over a year ago) I am worse than ever, I am very quick to get angry, and I say things to those I love without thinking prior to, and I think and mumble things to myself that are even worse. I am unclear if this is due to the meds, but I am leaning towards yes. Zyprexa worked well as a child, but I gained a ton og weight. I have been on more meds than I can count since I could remember, and thats the biggest issue, misdiagnosis, and the effects of the wrong Rx. Be careful when deciding."
