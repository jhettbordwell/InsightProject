I began taking it in the morning but by noon I got tired and had to take a nap. My Dr. perscribed citilopram to take in the am and instructed me to take the bupropoin at dinner. It helps me calm down from the citilopram and lets my mind relax and be able to sleep at night. It has helped my depression greatly. 
Oh, I don't know which medication did it but it helped me quit smoking. I have smoked for 11 years, heavy! but now im a non smoker. "

No side effects, yet, but I have to say I DO feel better than I did before I started taking the drug, and feel pretty optimistic. I really like feeling this way, and hope it continues.

It gave me nausea, dizziness, made my eyes feel ""weird"", and excessive cold-sweats. Anti nausea medication helped to calm these symptoms. It made me really sleepy the first day (yesterday). And today I was really weak. But don't just give up on the medication, I assure you, with patience you will acclimate to it."

New perscription for Welbutrin 300 was given to me as Budeprion 300. Just started taking it but based on all the info I am reading on Bupropion (see SPELLINGS) not sure what to think. I will speak with my Dr.
