0$Condition: Depression$1/7/2020 1:48:11 AM$Reviewer: Emroever, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$1$I felt like the depression was at bay, but it made my anxiety skyrocket. The side effects were extreme—either not enough sleep or I’d sleep the entire day, always felt unwell and nauseous, horrible headaches. I’m currently on week three of coming off of 20mg, and I keep forgetting simple words or use the wrong ones (completely out of my character)..!
1$Condition: Depression$12/16/2019 3:33:52 PM$Reviewer: Sam, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$4$Was switched to Celexa after Cipralex started not working for me. Celexa makes me sweat and cannot get a full nights sleep.
2$Condition: Depression$8/12/2019 9:29:33 AM$Reviewer: MGA, 65-74 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking Celexa since it was first available.  Previously, I had taken Zoloft for many years.  The Zoloft began giving me severe heartburn, so I had to stop taking it.  Celexa controls my clinical depression.  Without the medication, I am angry and unable to interact with others without being abrupt and hurtful.  I really like that it doesnâ??t take a great length of time to get back into your system if you are without it for a few days.  I am pleased with this medication as it allows me to function in my daily life.

5$Condition: Other$4/17/2019 9:37:35 PM$Reviewer: pepperjanuary219, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been taking Celexa for around 6 months after being diagnosed with agoraphobia. Before starting treatment with this medication I was riddled with anxiety and would pretty much only leave my house to go to work and worried constantly that I would have a panic attack in front of people or I would be inside a place like a grocery store and have to leave due to the stress of it all. Sometimes I couldn’t even get out of my car to go inside. Since I have been taking Celexa, my symptoms are definitely lessened. It’s a work in progress but Celexa is definitely helping. As far as side effects, I’ve only had one negative and that is a complete loss of interest in physical intimacy.
6$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/16/2019 3:26:22 PM$Reviewer: Katelyn163, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I started out with 10mg and it helped with my depression tremendously. The first week or so on it was horrible with all the side effects (dry mouth, night sweats, headache), but I stuck it out and am really glad I did. I recently increased to a 20mg dose because I was still experiencing quite a bit of anxiety w/the smaller dose. Some depression meds make you drowsy/spacey but Celexa hasnâ??t made me that way at all. I highly recommend giving it a try!

10$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/24/2019 4:05:54 AM$Reviewer: Happy heart. , 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I had a traumatic situation that send me spiralling out of control. I refused to take any SSRI despite my Doctors recommendation. It took her 6 months to get me to try one as I was petrified of any drugs that alter the mind. Eventually I had no choice , I became extremely mentally sick and because of this physically. I lost 30 pounds in 5 months. I tried celexa 10 mg along with clornazapan and never looked back. I had no side effects outside drowsiness which was fine I then took it before bed and finally I was able to sleep. I gained my appetite back and I never felt more clarity and happiness. This little pill saved my life. My only regret was I never took it sooner as my doctor adviced. Celexa is a life changer. I highly recommend it.

But a few months in (this is gonna sound odd) I had abnormal vaginal bleeding. I bled vaginally for literally 3 months straight. I consulted my doctor that gave me this medicine and he took me off it and put me on something different. As soon as I stopped the medicine the bleeding went away and I havenâ??t had bleeding like that since.

Then it stopped working. I have been crying 3-4 times a day for the past ten months. Initially, i would cry for no reason - just out of the blue. Now i get depressed when i cry and the past few months i have had flashes of anger when i cry. Generally, i'm not depressed anymore except for when i cry.

I felt pretty immediate results. For reasons I can't remember, I switched to different medications and tried 4 others before coming back to Celexa. Compared to Effexor (the last drug), I finally don't have the ""brain fog"" feeling anymore- and also feel more like myself!  Also the Effexor messed with my sex drive-- ugh! Thankfully Celexa is a much better drug for me overall. "

I took it for over 1 month and then stopped taking it for 2 months. Out of the blue for no reason at all I carried out an act of extreme violence and ended up in jail and then was found NCR. The police took my bottle of celexa away during the arrest. That was a very long time ago. Now im out I hired a lawyer and he got the legal system to purge my ncr records. My employment criminal background check has been clean every since. There is no record of it happening. It has been a very stressfull ordeal for me to deal with the system all these years.

My exsperiance with Celexa has been awesome.  It truly help me in so many areas.  I begin to like myself, what others thought wasn't so important.  I had problems my whole life till celexa.  I am very nervous about trying something new.  My only draw back with Celexa was the weight gain.  But I would rather be a little heavy as to not have the right balance mentally.

28$Condition: Depression$2/14/2017 12:54:34 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Out of all the depression medications I've taken, Celexa has been the best.  It helps with depression, and I lost weight when I started the medication.  The only bad thing is that you can't take this is you are trying to become pregnant or are pregnant, so I stopped taking it.  
29$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/1/2017 1:15:58 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$"Started taking Citalopram in 2006 after Paxil and then Lexapro- this was the most affordable. I have increased from 20 mg to 40 mg about 6 years ago. My pregnancy had no effects from this medication. It keeps me from panic attacks, anxiety & depression without making me feel ""fake"" happy-as I did with Lexapro. The only downside is when I forget to pick up my prescription. Stopping this med cold turkey is NOT something that should be done. I have had bouts of severe vomiting, and targeted shooting pains in my head, as well as prolonged nausea & heartburn after not taking it for 2+ days. Talk to your doctor before stopping this med!"

I would get so nervous while driving I would shake and my heart felt like it was going to explode, I would get really dizzy. I mostly stayed home and it turned into depression. I had taken Celexa before as a teenager when dealing with anxiety, at that time it worked well for me but I got pregnant and stopped taking it since, that was 8 years ago. My doctor prescribed me to Celexa again and after about a month I started noticing that I was feeling so much better. I could drive without much anxiety at all. I wasn't shaking or feeling I was on the verge of an attack. I never realized how much anxiety was taking over my life. The only side effect is pretty bad dry mouth.

I took this pill for Severe post-partum anxiety/OCD. I stayed on it for 17 months. And it was truly the worst 17 months of my life. The worst intrusive thoughts I have ever experienced, felt like I was in a constant panic attack 24/7 where I literally felt like I was going insane, my thoughts were constant loops of irrational fears and I would do anything to try and make them stop, I thought I had something spiritually wrong with me or I was going insane, horrible derealization, lost connection with almost every person except my boyfriend, no connection with my baby, couldn't feel any of my body whatsoever except barely my feet and the back of my back, lost all faith in God, wanted to commit suicide many times. I stayed on this medication for 17 months because I thought this was just how i had ""become"" from having a baby. The doctors said it was just anxiety and they didn't want to take me off of it to ""destabilize"" me. I was afraid I would only get worse without it. It finally became too much and I told them to take me off it and put me on Prozac for OCD. I am finally weaned off after a week, day 2 without it and day 2 of a full dose of Prozac. The intensity of my thoughts have lowered and I am starting to feel my head and legs again. I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy. Celexa was a living hell for me. I hope I keep getting better."

Because I am in recovery, I refuse to take anti-anxiety medication. I finally agreed to try this recently following a stressful family event that led to bouts of crying and worrying constantly.

Sometimes I was happy sometimes I was sad. Went to the doctor answered a few questions and viola...I was diagnosed as being depressed. The good doc prescribed 20mg 0f celexa. Never heard of it. did some research and was a little scared of the side effects. but started taking it anyway. over two months i didn't experience any of the side effects and didn't feel any less depressed either. Went back to the doctor and he upped my dose to 40mg. Well, the first few days after I began the 40mg I was throwing up and I slept all of the time. Now a few weeks later I have to admit, I feel great!!! Side note....in preperation for the nausea and vomiting I had my dr. prescribe zofran. worked like a charm.

I felt so good on Celexa that I continued to use it for 11 years.  I use it through two pregnancies.  Now, I have been off of it for about 45 days.  While on Celexa, I felt fine and things did not bother me much.  My babies, when born, did not cry.  They were the calmest children while breastfed.  Now I wonder what have I done.  I am physical sick every day.  I can not do simple tasks like go grocery shopping or listen to an automated recording on the phone. The migraines are intense and nausea excruciating, irritating, and my overall feeling miserable.  Do Not Take This Drug!  If you are on it, it is time to talk to your doctor about something different.  Take my advice, the shorter the half life of the drug, the better.

I'm not consumed with Depression.., Feeling sad, or hopeless. For the first time, in a long.., long time.. I feel content. I haven't lashed out or snapped at anyone.

44$Condition: Depression$5/8/2016 10:52:05 PM$Reviewer: ProfessorDepressed, 13-18 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$Celexa was the second SSRI I had ever taken, and during my time on it, I experienced some of the worst side effects I had/have had on medications. I gained 40 pounds, and my metabolism was essentially ruined. My anxiety worsened significantly, and my depression stayed about the same. I slept constantly, and felt like I was in a mental daze, which disappeared almost immediately after the drug had completely left my system. Once moved on to another SSRI, the bulk of my symptoms dissipated.   
45$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/6/2016 11:48:38 AM$Reviewer: Miller4, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I began taking the generic form of this medication about 2 1/2 months ago. I had began working a second job part-time in November of 2015. I had no other option as doctor bills began piling up, so when I started experiencing tightness in my chest and a slight feeling of breathlessness, I went to my doctor. High blood pressure runs in my family, as well as anxiety and this medication has helped me tremendously. For the first 3 weeks I felt more tired than normal, but afterwards that wore off and I have lost about 7 lbs. Things I use to stress about, I don't get so out of sorts about anymore. I feel balanced and in control. I don't intend on staying on this medication forever, but right now, it has been exactly what I needed.

I was in counseling and it was helping but I was tired of crying all the time and so much mood swings. My body couldn't handle all that I was going through and finally my ""little ball of sunshine"" outlook went with it. Now that I have been on them so long I feel happy and I can smile again. Time is the only thing that really can heal you but a little help isn't bad along the way. If you are thinking about taking the pill like I was. Do it. It will make you feel better. "

Anxiety attacks are very rare and I almost never cry (this used to be a big problem). Doesn't improve my mood much, and sometimes I still can't get out of bed, but I don't get sick from the stress nearly as much. I haven't gained any weight, but my sex drive has been affected much more than I would prefer.

I work full time and take 6-9 credit hours/semester while raising two children. Surprisingly I was diagnosed with depression. I started with 10 mg of Celexa. My mood improved tremendously within the first two weeks. I had zero side effects. I don't feel numb to emotion, in fact I feel like I have better control over my emotions. Everyday stresses bothered me less. Overall I am very pleased with this drug. The only downside for me is that it does not interact well with alcohol. I like to drink socially and can usually hold my liquor very well but, since being on this drug, I blackout easily which never happened to me before. I have be very careful not to overdo it.

51$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$3/28/2016 1:26:04 PM$Reviewer: Logan, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was experiencing long term problems with anxiety and depression that I finally realized required medical help. After discussing the problems I was dealing with, my doctor prescribed 10mg of citalopram for me with instructions for a return consult in a couple weeks. I felt a little sedated at first but also much more at ease and less depressed. Wife quickly noticed the difference in my demeanor as well and now makes sure that I take the medication on schedule. I had some minor GI upset initially which dissipated. The only other problem with taking the drug was when my doctor increased the dose to 20mg, which caused some sexual difficulties. After contacting my doctor, I was instructed to reduce the dose back to 10mg a day or two before sex might be expected and then back to the 20mg dosage afterwards. I know, this disrupts spontaneity but the overall tradeoff is well worth it for both me and my wife. We're both very happy with the results of the drug.
52$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$3/22/2016 4:32:41 PM$Reviewer: Gemma523, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$Before starting this medication I was very nervous about the potential side effects I read about online and other users negative reviews. I have now been on celexa (citalopram 20 mg) for a little over a month and I haven't experienced any negative side effects other than drowsiness after taking the medication. I take it before going to sleep at night so that it does not affect my daily routine. It wasn't until about the 4th week that I began to notice that my anxiety had decreased significantly. I used to become completely overcome with anxiety and worrying almost daily and I have now gone an entire week without becoming anxious at all. I do still experience anxious thoughts on occasion but I am now able to redirect my thinking and let them go rather than obsessively focusing on them and becoming depressed. I have never reviewed anything like this before but as there are so many bad reviews out there I thought it was important to let people know that my experience has been nothing but positive.

After increasing dosage a few times when it started fading in effects, I'm now on 30mg and will probably move up again in a few months. It's helped me have a good outlook and not be so depressed, but therapy is also necessary for most people with underlying issues. There were some side effects like dry mouth and feeling numb inside for a little while but I'm satisfied now.

I take 40 mg every night right before bed and it has helped control my anxiety and depression. I have had anxiety and depression and have been medicated for as long as I can remember. Celexa has been the best medicine for me so far and I have been on plenty of other anxiety and depression medicines. I notice when something begins to upset me or stresses me out, I become slightly dizzy and it feels a little like I'm having an out of body experience to the slightest degree. The feeling and dizziness fade quickly once I'm able to calm down. It's nothing horrible and it doesn't bother me much because the good effects from this medicine outweigh this side effect. I don't have the ""numb"" feeling that everybody talks about. I still feel happy, sad, and angry like I should. I'm just able to get through my days without the crippling effects of anxiety and depression. It was a little hard for me the first few weeks because I was convinced it wasn't working and I felt like my anxiety was actually increasing. But I stuck with it faithfully and at about 6 weeks, I started to feel pretty good. I stopped having so many anxiety episodes during the day and I noticed I was a slightly bit more optimistic about life. I knew it was FINALLY starting to help and it has continually helped me more and more the longer I have stuck with it. I know Celexa isn't for everybody but it's been a literal life saver for me and I'm pleased with the mental progress I've been able to make since being on it. "

My sex drive isn't as high as it used to be, I have almost no appetite (I only eat because I know I'm supposed to, and hypoglycemia contributes to panic episodes), and I have occasional nausea that goes away quickly, but these side effects are 100% worth it.

I was prescribed Celexa due to Obsessive thinking, social anxiety, and mild depression. I have previously taken Prozac and Lexapro but wasn't too happy with them due to feeling detached and more of a ""zombie"". Celexa was the first medication I have ever taken that made me feel ""normal"" in that I didn't think my personality was being altered to any significant degree. I started at 20mg and gradually worked up to 30mg over the course of 4 months due to persistent social anxiety. Now, roughly 6 months after starting Celexa, I think it's time for ween myself off. One of the biggest issue I had was sexual dysfunction. I literally had no desire to have sex, nor did it pop into my mind. I knew if someone was attractive and that I should be feeling some type of arousal, but that never happened. Another HUGE issue for me is that whenever I get anxious I sweat ALOT. Some research and speaking to my MD helped me understand that SSRI's can affect ones temperature sensitivity. So i was getting anxious about sweating when the very thing that was supposed to make me not anxious caused me to sweat in the first place...go figure. I recently forgot to take Celexa for roughly 3 days and felt so much better (even though I knew withdrawal was bound to happen). Now i'm just taking 20mg a day and so far I am experiencing some confusion/detachment from reality."

But due to a recent event that occurred about a month ago, my panic disorder and anxiety had become CRIPPLING. I could not get through my days without either worrying about a panic attack to the point where I cause one, or not even thinking about the panic attack and having it happen at any random time.It was getting to the point where I was living my days centered around trying to keep myself ""level,"" but also petrified that I was going to have another attack. I had constant racing thoughts. My doctor recommended an SSRI for me-Celexa (Citalopram). He prescribed 20mg pills. I would take 10mg at night for the first four days, and then after that I would take 20mg at night from then on. He also gave me a small  I MADE THE MISTAKE OF RESEARCHING ALL OF THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!!!! I completely understand researching a drug before you take it- but it is important to remember that a lot of people who have positive experiences most often do not write about it. It is the people who have negative experiences who will. I was PETRIFIED to take the drug b/c of the horror stories, until one day I realized that the side effects of the pill were worth it if it meant that I could have peaceful days. I took the first 10mg at night and had (and continue to have) a FANTASTIC sleep. I did not experience ANY nausea, no tightness of chest, no insomnia, no panic, no anxiety, NOTHING but a slight headache. It felt as though the pill gave me relief almost immediately. I have been on the pills for a little over two weeks. They have been a lifesaver for me!! I feel at peace. The racing, flooding thoughts have stopped. The panic attacks have been nonexistent. (My doctor gave me a prescription for Xanax just in case I have one) I feel like myself and I am happy again. I highly recommend trying them if you are suffering from anxiety, panic disorder, or depression."

The first two months I had a lot of nausea always about 1 hour after taking celexa, however, it worked amazing to relieve my anxiety and depression. For the first time in years, I was able to relax and was happy. After the second month though, I just began to feel numb. I didn't care about anything. Things that used to upset me no longer did, but things that used to make me smile didn't affect me either. But my depression prior was severe, so I stayed on it and focused on learning about myself and how unreasonable it is to feel unnecessary anxiety leading to depression. And things were better.

The reason I stopped taking celexa is because it caused SEVERE MEMORY LOSS. It started small. I couldn't remember what happened yesterday. Then, after month two, I couldn't remember conversations people would tell me I had with them. And at the end of month three, I was standing in front of a desk somewhere  (I don't even remember where I was) with a woman in front of me asking me what my name was. I stared blankly at her. I couldn't remember. I apologized and had to pull out my wallet and look at my drivers license to remember my middle name. I then began researching the drug and discovered that memory loss is a common side affect. I immediately stopped taking it, but it still took me about 3 months for my memory to return to normal. But on a positive note, it  feels back to normal now (about 1 year later) I apologized to my friends and let them know what I was going through, and surprisingly, one of my friends who I've known to have memory problems told me that he was taking the same medication. He ended up cutting his dose in half afterwards and noticed an improvement in memory. I still recommend it as a relief from the pit of anxiety and depression, so you can understand how life should feel, but I would never recommend it long term.

I spent the first 6 years on 40 mg, then cut it down to 20mg, and now am on just 10mg.  I needed it years ago because I was living in a very chaotic situation and was having panic attacks, crying jags at work, not being able to tolerate any stress, etc.  This medication has really helped me.  It takes about a month for the body to adjust to this medication.  I've tried Zoloft and Paxil, but they made me gain weight and I had alot of tiredness.  I also tried amitryptalene which was awful - I gained weight immediately.  Celexa has been nothing short of a miracle.  One of the side effects I experienced were some night sweats - though, they could be due to my bad periods.  The other side effect that never went away was a very low sex drive and a feeling of being non-emotional - not really ever crying or feeling ecstatically  happy - just the same all the time.  This was totally fine, but eventually, as my job and living situation got more secure, I didn't need as much of the dose.  That is why I have slowly decreased my dose to 10mg.  Though a small amount of anxiety has come back, so has the sex drive so that is good.  The celexa helps me to feel in great spirits, calm and collected under stress, and peaceful. It also helped with severe PMS which is a bonus.  Everyone's body is different, but for me, this has been a great drug.

96$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/6/2015 6:51:39 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$4$"This medication works great for me. Sometimes there is a little anxiety that will come up but NOTHING like what I used to experience with constant panic attacks out of nowhere. No pill can help with all of it. Only reason it is 4/5 for ease of use is you need to remember to take it everyday, with any type of pill, which sucks sometimes. Overall it really helped and I have been on it almost 3 years now no side effects. Half the time people have low sex drive, weight gain, etc it really is other reasons but everyone is quick to blame a medication, and ""suddenly"" feels better when they stop (mind over matter... placebo effect). Give it a try, have good expectations, and give it at least a month to work. Just because you feel anxious the first day you have it and have a ""heart attack"" (panic attack) its because it hasnt started working yet and you are still experiencing your anxiety!! Give it a chance :)"

I'm taking it for social anxiety. I couldn't stand being around a lot of people without thinking there looking or Judi g me constantly. I always wanted to run away from social situation. 

Anyway I started at 10mg for first two weeks the first few days felt like I had a lot of energy and jitteriness. After that I had extreme anxiety sweating insomnia jaw clenching. After two weeks moved to 20 mg again extreme anxiety bad thoughts ect. This lasted right up to week 5 on the drug. Now let me tell you I feel amazing no more anxiety nothing I feel great. I will be sticking to 20 mg until I feel the need to higher the dose. There is one side effect that has stuck with me still, it is much harder to orgasm, I'm not saying it killed my sex drive because it hasn't it just takes awhile to orgasm. I've also lost weight so far as my appetite has decreased.

Please read do not go online looking up a ton of reviews it will scare you from taking it. If you need just try and stick it out the first month WHICH IS HORRIBLE but once it kicks in it is great. If you do decide to read reviews make sure it's reviews from people that took it atleast 2 months because again the first month is hell for me anyway. Put it this way I can see myself on this for the rest of my life and I'm not even 30 yet. Hope this helps someone out there by the way I'm on the generic citalopram much cheaper"

felt so much better after being on this med for a while I decided to wean myself off it..bad move as I experienced such a bad relapse of severe depression, I thought I would never feel better again.  I went back on this med and finally 6 mos later I am feeling better again.  Be careful about going off your meds without doc supervision, it was a lot harder for me to feel better after relapse.

I did have to increase dose from 20mg to 30 mg after 2 years because it seem to lose effectiveness.  Overall, it has vastly improved my well-being.  That constant ""under-current"" of negative and fearful energy completely went away after 10 days to 2 weeks of using it. My manic episodes lasts a few days, instead of a week and are less dramatic.  The side effects are still there... constant drowsiness and diminished ability to reach orgasm.  But the benefits well outweigh the negatives. "

Been in therapy through the years and tried many different medications. I have been taking 20mg Celexa for about 5 months now and I feel better than I can ever remember feeling. I did have constant yawning for the first month, and still do periodically. I take it at night and sleep better than I have in years. Yay for that! I have noticed that I don't feel deeply on this medication (like watching a sad movie where I would normally cry, I don't). It definitely takes the edge off and keeps my mood at a manageable level so I can deal with the difficulties life throws at me. Another thing I would suggest is something called Mindfullness Training. I am also doing that through the Veterans Administration and it is extremely helpful with interpersonal communications with family, friends, kids, and work relationships.

109$Condition: Depression$9/14/2014 11:44:42 AM$Reviewer: Sabrina J., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$"I have suffered from depression and anxiety (most especially the latter) for a good portion of my life, but the last few months has been the worst bout of depression I have ever experienced.  Some years ago, I took Paxil, and it gave me the worst stomach pain and temporary restless leg syndrome, which was the most bizarre experience.  I was afraid to try another anti-depressant after my past experience, but I couldn't get out of the hole I was in, which just kept getting deeper and deeper.  It was to the point where when Robin Williams ended his life, I kept wishing it were me instead.  I went to my doctor because I had been battling sickness after sickness (strep throat, cold, flu, etc.) for several months, and told her about the funk I was in.  She told me that depression actually suppresses one's immune system, which would explain why I kept getting sick, so she prescribed Celexa, stating it may help to bring me out of the depths I had been in for so long.  I was hesitant.  I resisted for a couple of weeks.  But after the worst bout of crying and suicidal thoughts I'd had since this started, I decided to take half a pill (5mg).  I had a headache the next day, but not terrible.  Took another 5mg the next day, then upped it to the prescribed dose of 10mg.  I've been taking it for two weeks, and let me tell you, I haven't felt this ""normal"" in months... maybe years.  I have the occasional bout of nausea, but not terrible, and a headache every so often, but save that, it's been a miracle.  I don't plan on being on them forever, just until I feel like I can handle life on my own again.  However, I would recommend them to anyone who is suffering from what feels like Hell on Earth.  They work.  They work fast.  I can smile.  I can laugh.  I don't feel nervous or terribly sad.  I feel like me.  And that feels so good.  "

I have to say that so far this drug has been very hard for me to use. The side effects really make my depression and anxiety feel worse. I've lost a lot of weight and I cannot sleep. Recently, I've been feeling very harsh pains with the muscles in my legs. Sex is no longer an option. I have taken a few medicines for my depression and none of them have given me side effects like this. However, I think I'm going to talk to my doctor very soon and ask him if the side effects are really worth it to continue this medicine. I hear it's very hard coming off of it and I believe that. I am 18 and started off with 20 mg and the side effects only got worse when he upped me to 40mg. The side effects sometimes scare me.

The doctor put me on it for anxiety and mood. I started out with 10mg a day and now take 40mg a day. Overall I am disappointed with it and the reasons are: Every so often the have to keep upping the dose because after a couple months it doesn't work too well. If you accidentally run out of this medication IT IS DANGEROUS! They claim it stays in your system for weeks  so there is supposed to be no worry if you run out but that is a crock. I ran out of it for 5 days and ended up having to go beg the   doctor to see me early. I did not feel like myself, my blood pressure was 147/103 (and I have never had high blood pressure). And I was flipping out. Not a good feeling. So all in all it does help, but only for a little while.

I began taking it for general anxiety/depression.  It is amazing.  I have never felt better.  It has quieted my mind, took away the anxiety and negative self-talk that owned me for so long, and has made me more confident and focused than ever before.

The first night I took it, I felt an immediate difference the next day.  I felt a sense of calm and my mind was quiet.  After about a week, my wife noticed a total difference in me.  After the next few months, it just got better and better.  

I have had no serious side effects as others have mentioned.  The only thing I have noticed is that I am a bit more sensitive to alcohol.  That's not a big deal to me though at all.  I had slightly more vivid dreams for a couple of months but that went away.  

I have always taken it at night based on the doctor's recommendation and have had no issues.

Give it time.  My doctor said it takes a few months to fully feel the full effects.  She is absolutely right based on my experience.  It's an awesome drug.  Give it a chance if you feel you may need it, it might change your life.  I am a better husband and father for it."

I knew that I had a problem and felt ""the black hole"" coming on but for several years I just dealt with it.  Recently, there have been a lot of changes in my life and my doctor felt like it was time to try something new.  I was put on Celexa 40 mg.  I read the side effects when I first got the medicine (something I don't normally do).  I laughed at the fact that this medication could cause constipation.  Not only have I been depressed, but I have been constipated for about half of my life.  Although I was unsure about this particular side effect, I decided that it was better to be out of my black hole.  This is my fifth day on Celexa.  I have experienced nausea, sleep deprivation and headaches.  The nausea subsided after a few days.  My only concern is that I woke up this morning and couldn't see clearly.  I felt a film over my vision and couldn't even spuint to see better.  I looked up side effects once again and did not see blurred vision as a side effect.  I am hoping that as the day goes on, things will become clearer.  Over all, this medication seems to be working.  We shall see.  "

My only question now is that the last 2 days I am having quick little flashes of headache---like just seconds, and I do not know if it is related to Celexa or not yet, could possibly be allergies, as everything is dusty outside right now. It happens a few times a day, often right behind one eye or over it. I do not usually get headaches. It has given me energy to do my work now, and I am sleeping great so far, so hope this headache thing is something that will do away in time. Good the headaches never lasts long.

173$Condition: Depression$1/16/2014 11:57:29 AM$Reviewer: Katherine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I have been taking Celexa for 7 years due to depression and anxiety. I started with 20 mg and eventually went to 60 mg which seemed to work for me. My doctor recently changed my dosage to 40 mg due to new studies that have found anything over 40 mg can cause heart issues and/or death (great). Celexa has helped me with my depression/anxiety and even OCD. I used to take it along with Wellbutin, and stopped Wellbutrin when I went up to 60 mg of Celexa. But now that I am back down to 40 mg, I am back on Wellbutrin. Only negtive side effect I had from Celexa the first couple of months I took it was extreme sleepiness to the point I would fall asleep at my desk at work even though I was getting 8 hours of sleep at night. After a few months, that side effect disappeared. Weight gain was about 10 lb total over the last 7 years, no big deal. I was anyway from the depression, so that was a good thing. Not even sure if the weight gain is due to Celexa. I would recommend Celexa as a way of taking the edge off depression and anxiety, you just need to make sure you find the right dosage amount for you. It has done a world of good for me!

It took a solid 6 weeks for it to kick in, and a few months for the worst of the side effects to wear off (sweats, vivid dreams, disconnected feelings, digestion issues). After that it just seemed to keep getting better. My everyday anxiety and occasional panic attacks became very muted, and much easier to manage. This helped me stop depending on benzos for anxious ""flare ups."" Everyone around me noticed and my relationships improved. I lack the extremes in emotions, for better or worse. In the beginning, I wasn't noticing the weight gain. I actually felt like I was making better dietary choices. But I was a little more tired and I now require at least 8 hours of sleep a night or I need a nap during the day (less energy/activity). I also didn't notice the gradual decline in my sex drive. So, now that I am at about a year of taking this RX, I realize that while my anxiety and panic are managed--staving off the depression that they caused--the 20-25lbs I've steadily gained, coupled with the low sex drive is negatively affecting me, and my partner! So, I'm looking to change meds at this point. Again. I've previously taken buspirone (Buspar), and paroxetine (Paxil). Neither were as effective as citalopram."

I wanted to comment my results so far for anyone in the same boat and will update monthly. The previous comments posted by users have been extremely helpful and appreciated. 

After this first month I have noticed no lessening of any of my depression symptoms. I had noticed a worsening if anything in the last two weeks but am unsure if this is related to the medication. What surprised me the most was for the last two weeks I have ended my sleep cycles on a horrible note. Vivid dreams of a negative sort forcing me to awake with a truly awful anxiety. I had no idea this could be caused by early use of this medication until reading here what other users had experienced, All cases I've read state this does not last so fingers crossed this side effect dissappears sooner rather than later. 

I have noticed no effect on my appetite or sex drive.

Will keep posted. I hope one finds this somewhat helpful. Cheers."

Nothing worked. Before Celexa I was on Lexapro, which is supposedly the newer, more 'refined' version of Celexa, and felt horrible. About 6 months ago, I decided to switch over to Celexa and have never felt better. I felt a difference right away (within a day or two). I am finally back to my happy, bubbly, chatty self. Other SSRIs that cut my anxiety made me feel 'flat'. Not Celexa. On Celexa I'm still able to feel my emotions-I can laugh and cry (when appropriate)-without feeling overwhelmed by them. I take it in the morning and have so much energy all day. I highly recommend this medication.

So I just started taking this drug (20mg every morning) about a week ago. My whole life I've never really felt something this bad... I've always noticed that when I get something in my head I have to get ""approval"" so I don't need to worry..but I also am a huge perfectionist. Any time I'm sick or think something may be wrong with me, straight to the doc for this guy gotta have that answer now! I just graduated college and just took on an awesome (very stressful) job. Someone at work mentioned that one of our workers who went out off on his own as a salesman killed himself because of stress... my OCD hit overload on that one. Since then, I had convinced my self I was crazy. Every little thing wrong in my life or that I have done in the past, if it comes in my head, I get hooked! Although this has been awful.. I have struggled with alcohol and some depression for a while and found this as a possible Godsend to change my life and let go of alcohol and my worrying. To sum things up.. just was wondering if anyone else has felt this way. Whenever I think of one bad thing about myself it becomes ""wow..that's whats really wrong with me huh?"" Only been a few days but praying for the best! Thanks in advance to anyone who replies. "

I was supposed to decrease the amount and I didn't do that -- I stopped taked it all at once.  NOT a good idea.  I acted weird, didn't know where I was, spent a night in a car, off the side of the road.  I saw things that were not there...I was taken to the hospital - put my loved ones though h---They didn't know where I was until the police notified them. At age 63, this was my first ""mental"" screw-up. I was taking Celexa to help me in the loss of my Mother. Listen to your doctor if and when you want to stop this medication.  "

The second day on it, I started having some very strange side effects. I first noticed that my pupils were incredibly dilated, as though I was on a heavy drug. I shrugged this off and began to watch television. I have some hearing issues, and typically turn on subtitles. I then noticed that I could hear perfectly fine! I was pretty excited about this... Until I started feeling like I was melting into the couch. Then I looked down at my phone and it was one giant blur. Everything was moving all over the screen. 

So, for me, this drug wasn't the right one. I either had an allergic reaction, or was sensitive to the already low dose. "

It makes you extremely hungry, but despite watching and eating healthy, it refuses to come off. And this was after I had lost 40 pounds on my own! 

Despite the increased appetite, I should mention that I have no libido with this as well. Nothing, I can't even get in the mood and when I manage to, it physically hurts. 

I also feel like a walking zombie, as I'm just ""here"" and that's it. I feel constantly tired and despite 30MG of adderall, it's still there. I don't feel like myself, even though the depression is better, but at the same time, it feels like I don't care and it's not worth it.

I can't even muster the energy to get angry, and I'm constantly tired or yawning.

I have already tried Wellbutrin and it made me all over the place with my moods. Doctor ended up switching me to Celexa, which hasn't been good for me either. Doctor sent me home with a trial of Viibryd and to see how that does after I wean myself off of Celexa. I am hoping for better results for sure."

Lexapro has 1  part to it and it comes from Celexa.  Celexa has 2 parts to it and I needed that extra part that Lexapro didn't have and that in which helps more with anxiety.  Lexapro made me soooo tired.  I gained weight and didn't want to do anything.  Lethargic.  At first it worked great but quickly went to laying around all the time and not feeling motivated.  It's hard to get adjusted to and takes time.  Give yourself time and be patient. It did have some sexual sides effects but when my doctor put me on Wellbutrin it offset that side effect and I was back to having orgasms but I couldnt take the weight gain and tired feeling.  I am on Celexa now and its works GREAT for anxiety and I've lost the weight! But I am having some sexual side effects.  I think it also hinders my sleep a little bit.  I notice sometimes more anxiety but not giving up. This stuff works great for day to day living.  I will be patient and give it some more time.  For now this is working.

My doctor told me it's in the same class as the Prozac, which my daughter takes and does fine, no side effects at all. It just goes to show that different drugs affect people differently. Just be careful if you decide to take this product. Make sure you are with someone that can monitor you.

Went from a healthy, active, full of energy human to best describe is a vegatative state. Slept 12 to 18 hours per day and was always exhausted. Didn't care about living, no hope of the future, absolutely zero energy. Major increase in the frequency of the panic attacks, so severe that I ended up in the hospital E/R. Had chest pains daily, tingling in both hands, muscle spasms in my legs and feet. B/P at the E/R was 212/100. My quality of living did not exist on the scale. I just wanted to die and get it over with. Even visited my children and was saying my good-bye's.  I decided to stop cold turkey against my Dr's advice.  I had nothing left to live for and confusion and lack of energy left me hopeless, I WANTED to DIE.  After being off the medication for a few days, I started feeling better. Now it has been a month and I have returned to being alive again. 8 hours of sleep and I am full of energy and excited to be active all day without getting tired and exhausted. Going to work now is refreshing compared to struggling on how to drive there safely without getting lost on the way.  I highly recommend the FDA reconsider the safety aspect of this drug.  I can't imagine how many people are taking this medicine and not able to think clearly or go into a very deep depression as I did.  I wish my Dr. would take this medication for a month and report their mental/mood changes and desire to live.  If they did, I believe they would reconsider prescribing this potentially life threatening drug. I will update this post after 6 months without Celexa, but for now I recommend that this drug be banned for human consumption.

Do wake up some - but daugher at age 8 still wakes up and calls for me.  Biggest side affect has been sex life.  Hard to get in the mood and can never ""get to where I want to be"".  Frustrating for myself and my husband.  Noticed this side effect immediately after using.  Still have not decided to continue taking it....feel as if I am on auto pilot...not really living some days."

Lost insurance benefits and had to switch.  Used Cetalopram for the past year and have had to stop it (on my own, cold turkey) because it caused me to become, basically, a vegetable.  Didn't care, didn't want to care, etc.  Now I can't get another prescription for anything until I see a shrink because my doc thinks I could be bipolar which I have never, ever been.  I've just been anxiety-ridden my entire life.  I am now going through withdrawal which is causing me even MORE anxiety than ever. I'm willing to ride it out and hope for the best since the earliest I'm able to get an appointment with a shrink at the clinic is October.  I'll hang in and hope people will bear with me.

Two weeks in I started having stomach pain and bleeding issues on 10 mg. Told my doctor, she couldn't believe it and brushed me off. When I ramped up to 20 mg it really got bad. Stomach pain, nausea, loss of appetite and major bleeding issues. After getting only five hours of sleep in a thirty hour period, I started to taper off to 10 mg. Bleeding issues aren't as bad, sleep issues are better but I still have nausea and I don't feel hungry. I have to use the clock to tell me it is time to eat. Today I start the 5 mg dose and see doctor tomorrow, (she mentioned something about trying Lexapro when I called in with issues.). I tried taking it with food, no help. So I take it in the evening with dinner. My sleep meds are now working again. Hope that the nausea goes away.

One of two Medications, the (Celexa and Xanax) that I have been on from 2004 for Aid in this. 

**(I won't speak any more about the Xanax)

The first 5-6 Years were just great upon this Medication in many ways. I felt like THIS Script was the first out of the many, MANY different SSRI's & such that I've been Prescribed was actually going to help Myself  out lots. Well, as I said..it did. But then came sometime in 2010. For whatever reason, (Notice, also about 4 Years in, My 40mg dose got knocked up to a daily 60mg dose) it just stopped having an effect on Me at all...You know, whatsoever. As I said, THAT was back in 2010, (Early 2010, maybe) when it lost its Potency, and I have STILL been taking it. Scared of the awful SSRI Discontinuation withdrawals that could possibly manifest You know...I've been taking it now basically 7 Years. But as I said, the other Medication that I have mentioned in this post, 100% definitely helps out, so I don't see the problem in continuing to take it, as other than the fact I feel its lost a lot of it's potency, there are also not a single Extrapyramidal symptom tht I get from it. So I'm Thankful for that. I WOULD recommend Celexa to first time SSRI users as I said, it worked great for Myself for many Years, and I never had Sexual Impotence, or any usual effects the the SS Reuptake Inhibitors are known to cause. I, Myself would say this is THE best SSRI, and I've taken at least 12 of them. "

Prior to hospitalization, I was taking Wellbutrin 150mg twice daily. The Celexa has helped immensely with my mood, and it took me only 4 days to start noticing a major difference in how I feel about myself. I am calm, and I feel like I finally have some control over my emotions. I no longer experience random crying episodes & I have a LOT more patience with with family. I used to not even get out of bed. I also seem to handle stressful situations with less anxiety. I have been able to enjoy a few of my old hobbies again. For the first time in over a year, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. The only side effect I'm experiencing IS LITTLE TO NO INTREST IN SEX. I also have an EXTREMELY hard time achieving orgasm now, and if I am lucky enough to have one, the intensity level is about 2/10, where as before I starting taking this medication, I had a very high sex drive, and no trouble having multiple orgasms with an intensity level of 8-9/10. I am a 37 year old female, in a stable and supportive relationship with a man, and this has been a MAJOR issue with me, since we used to enjoy sex at least twice a day. I know it seems silly to regard sex as being so important. I have a wonderful emotional connection with my partner, but now I am unable to connect with him physically. I plan to talk with my therapist about a possible med change if there is no way to fix the current situation. Other than this one single complaint,(which many people probably wouldn't object to) THIS MEDICATION HAS TRULY WORKED WONDERS, AND I FEEL HOPEFUL ABOUT LIFE AGAIN!!!

A caveat: the drug will lessen your libido but I still have a strong one so no complaints.

On 10mg day for about a month, so far so good. Side effects have been tolerable. Most noticeable was the nausea and loss of appetite for 1st 2 weeks. Have lost about 5 pounds, cravings for sugar and carbs are gone. Started taking at night a few hours before bed however, to try and deal with feeling unmotivated - that is about the only way I can describe it. I feel ""lazy"". The switch has been for a few days, and have noticed I feel more ambitious during the day, which is great. Issue now is headaches in the morning. My anxiety had been causing me chest pains and waking me up at night and the Celexa has completely helped that so it's been a godsend to have about 4 weeks of sleeping through the night, something I haven't had in about 4 years. So that in an of itself has helped with mood. In general, am happy with this, have noticed it does take more to climax, but hey, more nooky time isn't a bad thing :)"

I started taking it because I had extreme anxiety, racing thoughts.  It was tremendously helpful for me within 2 weeks.  It was a lifesaver.  I was taking 60.  My major complaint is I gained nearly 100 pounds within a year.  I have been able to get some of the weight off.  But, the benefit, mentally, outweighed the physical for me.

Problem is, now, I want to come off.  Any SSRI is a very slow, slow, SLOOOOOOOOOOOW process of coming off because of head zaps, feelings of spaciness, just feeling ""off"", but I have faith that little, by little, I will come off.  I would go back on it in a heartbeat if those symptoms returned.

I am and was almost completely homeopathic, natural medicine.  I had tried everything before Celexa.  Nothing worked as well. So, all in all, besides the weight gain (which not everyone gets), I recommend it."

402$Condition: Depression$9/16/2012 12:18:20 AM$Reviewer: Beth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I had been through months of chemo and then had surgery. My family and my surgeon felt I was not acting happy enough that the cancer was gone and were concerned that I was still sad over losing my breast and still needing pain meds (even though I was down to half doses). I was prescribed 10 mg. I was so nauseated I could not eat, couldn't stay awake during the day, and finally started being awakened multiple times at night with panic attacks, which was the end of my taking it. First day off had major headache, after that I was back to myself. I unfortunately learned to limit sharing my pain at my loss to my support group and my journal, but my family was convinced the antidepressant was working until they found out I hadn't taken it for a week. I am now hearing that the few days I was on it must have really helped me for over a week and am being pressured to go back on it or get a different one. Even if I hadn't had side effects, I think the real problem in my case was (and is) that there are people in my life who are not willing to give me time to heal emotionally, although they are very supportive of my need to heal physically. Perhaps the side effects even saved me from a worse problem of trying to get off it later. I think doctors are too quick to reach for the prescription pad, especially if depression is clearly situational. Counseling and acceptance (and maybe some hugs) would have been better.

I once tried to wean off of it with the help of my doctor when I was in college (I felt great and didn't think I needed it anymore) but the panic attacks returned so I've been consistently taking it and feel like a normal person! It originally took me about 2 weeks to fully adjust to the medication and help relieve my anxiety. Unlike what some people believe, I still have emotions! I cry, I get stressed, I feel joy, etc. I just feel like a normal person and that's all I could ask for. I did not gain weight either. The only side effect I have is occasionally I get ""brain farts"" which I like to call them when I have trouble remembering a fact or something! ha! (I've read this is a side effect of celexa) I can live with this because I feel like me and if you have had panic attacks you know how horrible they can be! My doctor says as long as I feel great I can take the drug as long as I want! :) Hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about celexa.  "

Thats great if you want to be a zombie and have no real feelings anymore. It felt sooo good to cry, I had missed it. I'm the type of guy that doesnt ever cry, and it was wonderful! I would not recommend this drug to anyone, unless you have been through some serious trama that you need to get through. Like I said you become like a zombie (no emotions)! You feel good all the time no matter what has happened in your life. If you want that, then this is the drug for you. Side effects were loss of sex drive totally!! My girl didnt like that at all!

Also taking during my pregnancy, my OB said it is safe for pregnant women. When I don't take Celexa, I become agoraphobic and cannot drive in the freeway or leave far from home. With Celexa I have no anxiet throughout the day like I used to. I do not know why I developed Panic Disorder, suspect I got it from my father. I made the mistake of weaning myself off Celexa last year, only to have my Panic and anxiety disorder come back. After I REstarted Celexa again in March, it took 2 and a half weeks to be able to come out of my home after being housebound for two weeks. When it starts to kick in, it takes about two to three weeks, and it didn't stop me from worrying about having a panic attack. I had to test the medication by forcing myself to drive alone around the neighborhood. After one week on it, I didn't get a racing heart, but could only drive 3 blocks. After two weeks on it I was  still hyperventilating a little bit when I drove 3 blocks. But after 2 and a half weeks on it, I was symptome free physically. It did not stop the mental thoughts of ""what if I get a panic atttack"". Those thoughts did not fade away until I drove around a farther and farther away from home a little everyday. Then after that, I didn't have worrisome thoughts after. Overall, I highly recommend it for Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Agoraphobia. I am taking 20 mg. But will like to raise it to 30 mg if I find a job where I have to communt ten miles each day.

After nearly 20 years of talk therapy --and a very toxic work environment --my new MD prescribed Celexa (I'm on generic form). It worked almost immediately for me --my anger, anxiety and apathy lessened, and my obsessive worries are nearly gone. Only side effect has been headaches and increased appetite (salty carbs and sugar). I can't drink any alcohol on it (that's fine). The benefits far outweigh the side effects! I wish that I had been less averse to taking medications; my anxiety & depression has been a constant battle since age 19.

She was started on 20 mgs then 40,then 50, then 60 and he wanted to take her to 80!  About 1 1/2 years ago I notice a change in her behavior.  My wife of 47 years was getting more distant and showed little or no affection.  Our relations are 0 now and we had always had a very affectionate and warm relationship, and that was gone.  The day it came to a head I put my arms around her in the kitchen one morning to give her a hug and she stood there like she was a robot with no feeling.  It hit me so hard for the rest of that day I though I would die of a broken heart.  This is when I started to to use Web MD to look into the meds that she was taking and found our what was going on because of the Celexa.  I talked to her Psychiatrist and he told me in so may words it wasn't any of my business and my wife was his patient.  ""What the heck about our marriage""?  I trusted these doctors and I feel they have made a bigger mess of my wife then when she started her treatment for depression.  I am glad after we had talked the doctor has changed her to Lexapro with Wellbutrin and the fog seems to be lifting, but she has a long way to go to get back to her normal self.  I feel that before our spouses are put on these medications the family members need to be brought in, and helped to understand what they need to do to be the support structure for the depressed member.  If the member getting the help loses the love and support of the spouse it will make things much worse for the for the marriage an relationship. I would like to see the family member have several sections together and maybe work through the depression if possible before the SSRI medications are prescribed,  I feel that the patient becomes addicted to these medications.  I love my wife very much after all of these years and I wish I would have been included with the therapy that she was being prescribed and not pushed on the side."

I was having a lot of anxiety problems which I could not control (started w/the death of my Dad). I was warned that I would gain weight and lose my sex drive and maybe have upset stomach. None has happened. This drug has been great for me. I do find that there are times it seems more affective than others. I have also heard that with women, anxiety can creap up on you based on changes in hormones. I am a 53 yr old female and post menopausal. This maybe is why there are times where I feel a little less under control - but this happens pretty rarely. I do not want to stay on this drug forever. I am a little nervous as to what happens when you get off of it. So far so good. It has helped a lot!

I am a male, 34, weigh 195lbs, with a very high metabolism. Diagnosed with GAD back in 2001 after a panic attack / excessive sweating (Hyperhidrosis) / general feeling that something bad was gonna happen (post 9/11?). Anxiety / Depression are in my family history. I have been taking .25mg of xanax as needed during this period of time with good results. After getting a new (and very stressful) job in May, it didn't take long for my anxiety disorder to intensify and lead to a higher level of depression, with the first ever suicidal thoughts coming over the holiday break. The stress of the ridiculous unrealistic expectations of my employer combined with the responsibility that if I mess up our soldiers lives are at risk was too much to bare. I began double dosing my xanax just to get thru the work day and drinking heavily after work almost daily. Mood swings were out of control and I would just cry. Decided to go on LOA and spoke with my PCP about my issues. She prescribed the Celexa and asked me to go back to taking the .25 xanax as needed instead of daily. I also began seeing a counselor who agreed with the PCP about trying Celexa. After my first dose yesterday I almost instantly felt some side effects. Nausea, stomach pains (mild), light-headed, excessive yawning, dry and bad taste in my mouth, shortness of breathe, and sweating of hands / feet / underarms is on a new level. Also feel lethargic and like a zombie. I will post again in a few weeks once I have more experience with the drug.

525$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/25/2012 7:20:21 PM$Reviewer: emmaemma, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$" I started taking Celexa about a week ago and so far I am just ""okay"". I suffer from a generally panicky and anxious mood(which is usually almost all day long) and low grade panic attacks when I have to do oral presentations(which is almost every other day). I've noticed that I do not feel as anxious as I used to; I can now eat breakfast and lunch which I was unable to do before because of my anxiety. I can say that it is a major improve over what I was experiencing before. 

 The first day I had really bad nausea(maybe or maybe not because I was anxious about taking the SSRI) and now I'm just exhausted. I yawn constantly and feel drowsy in my classes; I'm also sleeping more than I used to. But I'd rather be drowsy than hyped  up and nauseated on nervous energy. So overall - I'm hopeful about the drug. I also have had loss of libido. No depression. No suicidal thoughts.

553$Condition: Depression$12/5/2011 5:17:31 PM$Reviewer: Stephanie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I was taking Lexapro for a few years before switching to Celexa due to insurance.  I had some unforseen circumstances that had me getting really depressed, unmotivated, and lack of energy, so my Dr. had increased my Lexapro from 10 mg to 20 mg.  When insurance became an issue I switched to Celexa 40mg.  When I had increased my Lexapro dose I found I was almost emotionless, and I found myself being forgetfull.  I also was experiencing a decrease interest in sex.  When I switched to Celexa those side effects disappeared.  I found myself being more motivated, feeling happy emotions again, and my sexual desire went almost back to normal.  I did notice when switching to Celexa that I experienced frequent yawning, but this went away after a month or so.  I have noticed that I have gained a bit of weight since I switched to Celexa, but I have not been on it long enough or gained enough weight to know for sure if Celexa is the reason.  I haven't had any change in my diet or activity level (I eat very healthy and i'm pretty active).  Overall I am very satisfied with this drug.  Although I was doing great using the lower dose of Lexapro, the Celexa worked much better for me when increasing the dose.  As with all anti depressants you have to wait 6-8 weeks to see the full effects and really know if it's working for you.

My wife sent me back to the doctor and was prescribed Celexa 20mg.  It helped immediately.  I've taken it for the past year without any noticable side-effects.  I'm 58 and very active.  I do go to the local YMCA about 5 days a week and run about 15 miles a week on the treadmill as well as using other exercise equipment.  I am a big advocate of using exercise to treat anxiety and depression.  Celexa and exercise has been a good combination for me.  I had always been fit and trim before my son died.  I gained about 15 pounds and had trouble being focused to lose weight.  During the past year I have lost 15 pounds and feel much, much better.  I won't give Celexa all of the credit, but I think it has helped.  I would recommend it for mild/moderate depression and anxiety."

593$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/4/2011 8:18:44 AM$Reviewer: TheThing, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$"I was prescribed Celexa and Ativan for panic disorder and depression about 4 months ago.  The Celexa has been helpful for my depression, but has not done much for my anxiety/panic attacks.  Combined with the Ativan it reduces the panic attacks, but I still have a lot of anxiety just from anticipation of certain situations.  

I wanted to write a review to address the issue of weight gain.  Before taking Celexa I was very active, mostly with weight lifting and mountain biking.  I was in pretty good shape and had 13% bf at 195lbs. I don't think Celexa causes weight gain.  What happens, at least in my case, is that I got so tired that I lost the motivation to  go to the gym and after about 3 weeks I no longer went to the Gym at all.  So for 3 months I have not exercised at all and have gained some fat weight.  My weight on the scale is about the same, but my body composition is different.  I think after awhile your body gets used to the chemical and you are not so tired.  I have just recently started back at the gym, so maybe I can get back in shape while on Celexa. 

Another topic I wanted to hit on is anxiety.  Celexa does not do much for anxiety. I think that it can help you  break through some depression which might help you to get motivated to do something about your anxiety.  This is how it has worked in my cause.  Unfortunately I think anxiety is something  I will have to struggle with forever."

My mind worried constantly every day and I could not break the cycle.  Therapy helped control the worrying but it took me hours of soothing myself before my anxiety would start to decrease.  I was on blood pressure medication as well since my anxiety was so high.  This went on for 3 years.  Since taking Celexa, my mind no longer worries endlessly and my blood pressure is back to normal.  I have regained my life and it is a miracle.  I would highly recommend this drug.  Before I had no quality of life and now I feel very happy.  I was up to 40 mg. at one time early on but found that if I took a nap, I was down for hours.  I was sleeping very deeply.  Now that I have cut back to 20 mg. my sleep is better.  I do have some of the strange dreams, which is a side effect, but that is minimal compared to the tremendous relief that has come about in my life.

I was going through A LOT. I had panic attacks. suicidal thoughts. the whole nine yards. I finally went to the doctor, and he diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety. so he put me on 20mg of Celexa, and it has worked wonders. I have moments where i'm down, but they're not as severe as before. i don't cry as often. and i don't think about ways i could kill myself and make it look like an accident. i'm such a happy person now. it's great. everyone enjoys being around me. and i can actually carry on a converstion with someone. the side affects were crazy at first. i was so sick to my stomach, and i yawned so much. but those are long gone, and i would highly reccomend anyone to take this anti-depressant.

Side effects suck, caused more anxiety than it cured. Made me sleepy during the day and no sexual desire. Gave me tremors and weird brain freezes where I couldn't think straight.  I slowly filed the dosage down over several weeks and have finally stopped using it. I didn't experience withdrawal symptoms too bad.  New research found it caused heart problems at > 40 mg.  Never take it again.  I don't care what the doctors tell you.  These pills are poison, they may relieve your sypmtoms for a while, but when you try to get off them it's like a psychotic nightmare.  The doctors have no idea how horrible the withdrawal is from these medications.  Some people never return to normal after stopping.  Before taking any depression meds have your doctor give you several suggested ones to review before you select one. Try to find one that doesn't cause horrible withdrawal symptoms or have side effects worse than being depressed.  Good luck.

I ran into a jam & ended up running out of my Lexapro and was unable to pay the $85 co-pay for my 3 mo. supply so was put on 40 mg Celexa temporarily, as it's WAY cheaper.  

Other than feeling a bit zombiefied, it definitly keeps me calm, but I also take Xanax XR 1mg at bedtime so that may have something to do with it too.  

I've also noticed I dont have as much energy on this medicine and have a tendency to space out more than with the Lexapro. 

Had a dr. appt today and we both agreed I should get back on the Lexapro as soon as my finances permit.

Overall, the Celexa works...just makes me kinda feel like the lights are on, but nobody's home."

I talked to the psychiatrist and he prescribed Celexa. I was hypervigiliant, thought about suicide all the time, I ate constantly, and I was so anxious about everyday life I couldn't concentrate.

Started off with the half a pill for seven days. I woke up with gloom and doom thoughts, rapid heartbeat the first two days on the half pill. On the third day I woke up, calm, with a normal heartbeat. I finally felt like myself. Went on the full dose (40 mg) four days later, but I could tell it was too much. I felt dead inside, just like I did with the Paxil I took two years ago, so I went back to the 20 mg dose after two weeks. I feel a little anxiety, but nothing like it was before. I feel like I can handle life now. I do have to remind myself to drink a lot more water because dryness seems to be a minor side effect. My appetite has also decreased.

I was first placed on 5mg of Citalopram (twice a day)and 18 months later my dosage was increased to 10mg (d.i.d.) and I seriously doubt I would be alive today had it not been for Citalopram. I am now on a combination of drug therapies including Citalopram (10mg b.i.d), Buproprion XL (300 mg q.i.d.), Lorazepam (1mg q6h), and Trazedone (100mg at bedtime). I doubt I will ever return to what I consider a normal life, but I am at least able to leave my home now and go to the drug store and grocery store. I still have a great deal of trouble with social events, but that is also due to the fact that I have stage-4-COPD and am on oxygen 24-7 which has taken a huge psychological toll on me. This is not including the physical ravages that past HIV medications have had not only on my physical appearance, but my mental state as well. I was infected with HIV in July 1985, but not diagnosed until February 1986.

From day one I felt almost depressed but I read other peoples reviews and saw others experienced this aswell. After 4 weeks I went back to see him and by then I was in a worse mental state than I started with! I was completely deppressed and that isnt like me at all! I told my doc that the anxiety kinda went away but I was sweating soooo much, had a headache everytime I woke up and it messed up my sleep so much. He increased my does to 40mg and thats when I quit it cold turkey. Withdrawl was terrible for about 4-7 days(too many syptoms to even bother writing) and even after that initial 4-7 days went by, I was depressed far more than I EVER had been prior and this lasted about 2 months. This drug literally turned all my emotions off and I lost alot of time because of this drug. If this even helps one person then it was worth it. God bless

This has totally changed my life for the absolute better. I can control any mood swings I have, people notice I'm happier, I feel happier and more satisfied with life. I do get major headaches if I forget to take it more than 2 days in a row (I guess that is a good reminder to take it). I take it at bed as it makes me VERY sleepy and thus it helps me sleep. The only side effect I have is that I started talking in my sleep after I started to take this and the talking in the sleep has only gotten worse. I do not know I'm doing it but the ones who are around me notice that I'm doing it. It has killed my sex drive which I understand happens with a lot of anti-depressants but it totally took away my suicidal thoughts so I do not mind the loss of sex drive one bit. I'm happy that I found a doctor that put me on this and helped me find the right dosage so that I could return back to the land of the living.

678$Condition: Depression$7/7/2011 2:56:29 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  (Patient) $1$1$1$I was experiencing severe depression and my provider prescribed Celexa, with a beginning low dose. For several months, I had been limiting my food intake to lose weight and my protein levels were probably low.  I did not share this with my provider as I did not know that it could impact the effects of Celexa.  I took the medicine for 1.5 months, starting with a low dosage. I developed a severe skin rash that has been diagnosed as an rare skin disorder.  The rash is still present on my back, arms, legs, and in my hairline.  The itching is unbearable and predisone did not relieve it.  In reading these posts, I read one from the woman whose sister committed suicide while on Celexa and that Celexa had become toxic because she had been dieting and her protein levels were low.  I believe that the Celexa became toxic in my system. Tell your doctor if you are dieting prior to taking this drug and be careful.  Celexa also made me like a zombie.
679$Condition: Depression$7/7/2011 10:53:18 AM$Reviewer: Amylein17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$5$This is a follow up review from July 2010. I took generic Celexa for 9-10 months. I gained about 10 pounds and was sleeping excessively. I would sleep 8 hours each night and still felt like I needed a nap every day. I went off this medicine to try ibuprpion to help me quit smoking. That was a failure-felt like a witch and it wasn't very effective at helping me stop smoking. After I went off ibupropion, I tried not taking any medicine, but rather supplements. I took 5HTP (for depression) and valerian root for anxiety for about a month. It helped a little, but not like AD medication. So I told my doctor I wanted something that made me feel like Celexa (happy, no worries, emotionally awesome), but that wouldn't make me hungry and sleepy all the time. She prescribed generic prozac which I've been taking for a little over a month. I really like it so far-normal appetite, sleeping ok, and feel good emotionally. I have noticed a bit of vaginal tenderness/inflammation, but I presume that is happening due to decreased frequency of sex. Other reviewers of generic prozac have said they've noticed it as well. As with Celexa, my libido has decreased, but that has actually helped since my partner has a weaker than libido than I did before depression hit. Overall, I'm very satisfied with generic prozac. Will follow up in the future if anything changes.

I was tired all of the time.  It made me feel high while it made my body rot away and become really weak.  I was encompassed by an all powerful apathy.  When I finally came to enough to ween myself off of this crap-it was like awakening out of a coma only to find yourself in another person's body.  I never had a weight problem before taking celexa.  I did not eat a lot while I was taking celexa, in fact it made me lose my appetite.  Exercise did not keep the weight off-it was a nightmare.  It has taken 4 months after stopping usage to get to a point to where the weight is finally coming off.  I was a very active dancer before usage-it destroyed the last thing that made me happy, MY BODY and my PHYSICAL STRENGTH.  It was not worth it.

I no longer experienced mood swings and overall seemed happy about everything.  I have been off of it for 3 months due to the fact that it wasn't working anymore.  I started to become more irritable and mood swings were present once again and have since spoke to my doctor about switching me to something else....she prescribed Pristiq.  I am only one week in and feeling better so far.  As far as Celexa, if and when you want to ween yourself off, doing so cold turkey will not work.  You will have to cut the pill in half or in 4's and get off that way.  I tried cold turkey and experience the worst side effects ever.  Vivid nightmares, electrical brain shocks, severe headaches.  Its not worth it.  Go slowly when getting off this med and know that it may take you up to 8 months as it took 6 months to get off in my case.  Good luck!

I have been taking the medication for about two months and felt the drug working very early on. I can personally say that the drug has made me feel even more depressed at times. My anxiety has also worsened and have since developed a major fear of panic attacks (which have occured in the past). I have experienced feelings of hopelessness and the feeling that I will never have another happy experience again. 
   The drug has also seemed to have a negative affect on my sleeping patterns. I often wake up many times throughout the night and sometimes have trouble falling back asleep on account of sad or depressing thoughts and feelings.
    My experiences with this drug has proved to me that all antidepressants do not work for everyone. There is still a chance that the drug will worsen your depression. "

Finally went back to the doctor and insisted that she put me back on the Lexapro with a pre-authorization for the insurance company. I am gladly paying the $45/mo. co-pay...my sanity is worth it.

Terrible crying episodes, no appetite, very distant from my husband and friends.  Just didn't feel like myself.

I stopped on day 11 because I had a severe allergic reaction including facial swelling, hives everywhere, hands and fingers swelling.  It was horrible!  I'm still itchy despite being on 2 Rx and 2 OTC's for this reaction.  This combo cased me to gain 8 pounds in a week.  Also very groggy feeling.
Has anyone else had an allergic reaction like this?  I'd be interested to know if the Celexa/Welbutrin really caused this because you'd think it would show up sooner and not wait for 10 days.  I didn't eat any new foods, no new soaps or lotions, no new fibers in clothing, nothing out of my ordinary routine.  This has got me so puzzled!"

I was on it for about 5 weeks and if it weren't for all the bad side effects I would definitely still be on it because it worked better than Prozac, Paxil,and Lexapro.  But the nasty side effects included nausea, fatigue, nightsweats, muscle aches, no libido, itchy rashy skin and big red dry blotches all over my face.  It also caused me to have short term memory problems- I couldn't even remember what I had cooked for dinner the previous night.  I have never experienced so many side effects and stopped taking it three days ago.  Now I'm having withdrawal symptoms which are no fun either.  :(

817$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/19/2011 12:16:09 PM$Reviewer: Gary, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Depression and anxiety attacks gradually crept into my life. The last four years saw a random like up swing, first in anxiety attacks and then finally sudden and deep depression. I have been taking celexa for almost three weeks at the time of this writing. Day two I was on the treadmill watching tv and I caught myself laughing at the comedy show. My wife ran into the room and stood amazed it had been that long since she heard me laugh. My high school students even noticed that I was smiling and laughing in class. It is little things like this that show me how far I had slowly regressed over the years. I feel alive again. Social gatherings that used to be painful, due to fear of anxiety attacks, seem to have disappeared. It's like I keep waiting for the anxiety to take over, but it doesn't. So I am still adjusting to the new me. The first few days I had really bad headaches and dry mouth. Headaches are gone and I sip water, especially at night. I can't believe that little pill has changed my life in such a positive way. I thank God and my doctor every day. I don't know when the anxiety and resultant depression started. I had testicular cancer 30 years ago, maybe that was the trigger. All I know is that slowly over the last 30 years, I was ever so slowly changing for the worse. So I am learning to love life again. Take heart all of you who know what I am saying. I feel young again.

Was feeling hopeless, worthless and low self esteem. Celexa helped me begin to turn my life around. Began with 20mg, then 30mg, now on 40mg. This was just the start, I began to workout again, and enrolled in a variety of self help courses. I take multi vitamin supplements, 5-HTP, meletonin(sleep), DHEA(memory) and amino acids. Celexa is the most important part of my daily routine and the additional of supplements and self attention has increased it's effectiveness. IMHO. Only side effect is drousiness, so I take it 2 hours before bed. I still have bad days, don't we all, but I can snap out of them much faster than before celexa.
Good Luck."

It has taken away every single anxiety symptom I had! No more physical pain, stomach issues, migraines or racing thoughts. However, I have gained 35lbs. I exercise 6-7 days a week and eat less than 1600 calories a day so, this was excessive. The only other side effect I've had would be waking up in the middle of the night starving 1-3 times a week. I am currently in the process of switching to Prozac due to the excessive weight gain. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this drug for anxiety issues. Its a great drug to try first. My weight gain is just a freak thing so don't be scared off. Trying it won't hurt! Also, if this is your first drug, as it was mine, give it at least 1-3 months to fully kick in. It did ease my physical anxiety symptoms immediately, but the racing thoughts didn't cease for at least a month into it. Good luck!

The first week was in a fog and yawned alot, but could tell right away, the medicine was helping.  Basically I had the same 'lifes problems', but did not get near as upset about them.  One common side affect for men is cannot ejaculate as easy.  For a guy this is somewhat of a benefit.  I can last a lot longer than I used to, which makes it good for my wife, but tends to tire her out. I had ED before taking and continue to take Viagra, so am not sure how this RX affects erection quality.

It wasn't until my doctor told me what anxiety/depression can do to a person. I was against taking medication so I went a year without taking any form of medication, and what a mistake that was. Worst year of my life. I finally gave into my doctors recommendation and began taking Celexa and after about 5 months, I was feeling great again. My

I've had both ever since i remember, but my social phobia got significantly worse in 9th grade. I woke up in the morning dreading the day and thinking of any excuse to give my mother not to go. During the summer i didn't leave the house or shower for 2 months and rarely ate. I read 24/7 to get my mind off depression. My mother got worried and sent me to therpy. I was diagnosed with social phobia, but kept my depression to myself. I was put on prozac for about a month. I got really hyper and woke up energized. I could not stop talking. My anxiety got better, but unfortunately my depression did not. I started self injuring and had trouble falling asleep. I've had suicidal thoughts before but i've always had a little bit of hope. One night i coudn't sleep and felt totally hopeless and started planing how i would kill myself. So i told my mom my medicine had kept me up and i needed to change it. I told my theripist that i coudn't sleep and that i felt hopeless the whole time on prozac. He told me that was impossible. Yeah, alright. They put me on celexa first on 10mg but that did nothing. They put me on 20mg and i take it at night because it makes me tired. I had no side effects. It has helped with the general feelings of anxiety. Like when i wake up in the morning i don't have to make excuses not to go to school. I can go to parties with my parents and can handle being around adults better, but once someone talks to me the anxiety lasts all day. So i'm feeling kinda bittersweet about it. I might have to up my dose or something. It hasn't helped my depression at all. I hope someone finds this helpful, haha.

I tried reducing the dosage to 10mg a day but this did not stop the tinnitus.  One of the beneficial side effects has been increased stamina and endurance during sex.  My wife loves it. 

Before Celexa, I was on Zoloft.  There was no tinnitus with Zoloft, however, the constant diarrhea was awful.

Once you are on it for awhile, make sure you taper off slowly and dont miss doses - withdrawal can have some pretty hefty side effects.  I will have to agree with memememe down below - works great but forget about ever having another orgasm unless you and your partner are very athletic or have serious stamina. I prefer Lexapro but this drug has roughly the same benefits/side effects and is MUCH cheaper!!  Another unpleasant issue seems to be the feeling of being absent minded.  Over all the side effects are better than the disease itself and I have managed to cope for a few years now.  If you are very sexually active you better skip this one....
882$Condition: Depression$11/30/2010 12:35:47 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I only took the medication for about 4 weeks and was at the lowest dose since my doctor wanted to work me up to the effective dose to try and help reduce side effects. But even on the lowest dose I felt terrible on it. It didn't do anything for my depression, which the doctor said I wasn't at a high enough dose or had it in my system long enough. But I suffered from extreme nausea, had an extremely dry mouth all the time, and felt very tired on the medication. I had to switch from taking it in the morning to taking it at night. I'm now on Paroxetine which does not give me any side effects as it is an extended release so it's less harsh on your stomach. For me, this one was a no go. The side effects were just as horrible as my depression.

I take 40mg each night, because I feel like a zombie if it's taken durring the day. Celexa keeps my mood swings under contol. I am no longer having extreme highs and lows. However, the side effects are very hard for me to get use to. Some of which include, feelings of absent mind, sweating, blurred vision, and forget about ever having an orgasm again! I guess you should really read up on the side effects and weigh your option before taking.

I was consumed by anxiety which has been a lifelong problem since I was a child, resulting more and more in physical symptoms as I get older (frequent ""adrenaline rushes"", indigestion/IBS, chest tightness, prolonged pounding heartbeat and, recently, mild panic attacks that were interfering with my sleep and ability to function). 5 years ago at age 22, I first started taking Celexa 10mg. At the onset of my treatment I was very stressed out and nervous. I got a number of moderate side effects: heart palipatations, heart ""skipping a beat"", and one episode of very rapid heartbeat that was scary because I was not prepared for it. I stayed on the medication and within a week the side effects went away. 10mg was eventually reduced to 5mg because I found that 10mg resulted in too much of a relaxing effect (carelessness, lack of motivation). 5mg improved this considerably.  I stayed on 5mg for over a year and eventually went off the medication altogether at the direction of the doctor because my symptoms were under control. 2 yrs later, anxiety symptoms returned amidst new life changes and stress.  I went back on 5mg celexa to mitigate the physical symptoms I was having.  My latest bouts of anxiety prior to taking Celexa were very distracting and were affecting my body. I saw a cardiologist because my heart was constantly pounding, blood rushing in my head when I tried to sleep. They ruled out any physical cause so I started taking 5mg Celexa again. Have been very pleased with the results. This medication almost entirely eliminates the abnormal anxiety that I have experienced recently and at other points in my life. I am on a very low dose, which is enough for me to respond to, and I do not experience any negative side effects.  The medication does prolongue sexual performance even at this low dose (consider that to be a positive side effect not a negative one). "

Additionally, I didn't know not to drink and had two cocktails...that is something you definitely do *not* want to do.

Worked o.k. but can hardly climax during sex.  Recent stressors of ended relationship caused always slight problem with contamination osd to go off the charts.  Was increased to 80 mg/day for last 13 wks with no imporvement.  Problem is getting worse.  Not working for me and I am not willing to give more time.  Obsessions ruling my life and suicidal thought present regularally.  Sure it works for some but the continuing of the OCD is going to lead to loss of job(and possible life).  Probably going to try prozac.  Had been on prozac for 7 yrs prior to Celexa.  It seemed to work good but I stoped it myself for no good reason and ended up crashing and burnig and put in hospital in 99.  That's when they put me on Celexa.  I still remember a distinct shift in my attitude after about 3 wks when I  starting prozac.  I never did have that feeling with Celexa.  I think it may have never worked that well for me.  It may work for you.  Good luck to you all.

I was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I take it once a day at night (with food to diminish any possible gastrointestinal side effects). I am feeling 100% better than I did just a few months ago. I could not be more satisfied with the outcome. Before, I could not sleep or focus on anything. I was nauseas and exhausted all of the time and I even felt so dizzy I couldnt drive or go to class. I am now falling asleep without the help of sleep-aids. I have energy again; I no longer sleep 8 hours and wake up feeling more exhausted than I did the night before. FOR ME this was the correct medication. NO MEDICATION IS CORRECT FOR EVERYONE. There are several negative reviews from individuals; take them with a grain of salt. Yes, the first week can be miserable on a new anti-depressant (you have serotonin receptors all over your body, including your brain, blood vessels and stomach. While your body is adjusting to the new levels of serotonin, you will probably feel nauseas and have a headache). You have to be patient though! After a week I could feel a difference, and after a month I felt great. I feel like my old self again. The only downside I can find with the drug is that I cannot drink AT ALL on this drug. As with most SSRIs, alcohol renders the medication ineffective because Alcohol occupies the same receptors in your body. Massive panic attacks came for an entire week after drinking moderately. I would happily give up alcohol for the rest of my life to NEVER feel the depression and anxiety ever again though. There are also sexual side effects, but for me they have been positive. I can now maintain an erection and have a healthy sex life. I also have no problem with having orgasms. Do not rule out any drug because of the reviews on here. Eventually, you WILL find the right drug for you :). HANG IN THERE!!

Celexa is wonderful, though my dose is slightly higher than the recommended maximum dose, little to no side effects (some nightmare issues and sleeplessness).  It took me from sitting in a corner of my room for days on end, with heavy insomnia, to being a normal functional person again. I love it!

It took me about 6 mos to decide then I couldn't take feeling the way I did anymore.  I can tell you that I am on 10 mg for about 9 mos and after the initial couple of weeks I don't have any side affects. I also feel like a normal person for the first time in a long time! Now I tell close friends about it who may have similar symptoms and I rave about it.  I used to cry for no reason and now I don't anymore but I still feel like myself.

Very scared that I'm going to go backwards after putting up with the side effects of Celexa. I don't want to lose the quality of my life for a pill. Have to take Adavan to sleep and have decided it might be better to take that and the Arimidex at night and Celexa in the morning. Sometimes it seems the pills are scarier than the cancer.

My first week I felt wasted drunk the entire time but it tapered of and since then I have felt great so long as I remember to take it. When I forget to take it the withdrawal symptoms are cripling; headaches, out of body feelings, tremmors, etc. The constant negatives I have experienced are constant fatigue, loss of appetite (lost 25 lbs in the last few months) sometimes I get irritated for no reason but not frequently. I really have not had a loss of sex drive which is unfortunate mine could stand to go down a bit. Overall Im very happy with it I feel more level and on the ball. I did try to take myself off of it at one point but was unsuccessful the side effects from quitting are unbarable severe nausea and dizziness crippling depression suicidal thoughts I could not summon the will to do anything I was physically and mentally destroyed they were enough to make me want to take it for the rest of my life. Do your research do not start this lightly it is a commitment and can really hurt you if you arent careful. The risks are worth the rewards if it works for you though.

The side effects were bad, to say the least.  The second day especially.  I was in a state of panic all day long, I couldn't sleep and felt jittery and drugged, my jaw was sore from clenching my teeth so much.  After three months or so I felt substantial relief from my attacks and stupidly I discontinued use (other reason for stopping was the complete lack of emotion and libido during sex).  Then two months later I was in the process of getting a new job.  After a call from the new employer I had an intense attack which was so bad I had to leave work early at my current job.  I immediately filled the prescription and started the painful first week adaption process again. This time I'm staying on it no matter what, every side effect is much better than panic attacks.

I've actually been able to travel,shop & eat out without running to a bathroom. The only side effect I have is dry mouth & loss of appetite. I'll take that over an attack everyday.

The side effects were Very minimal because I had already went through them when starting the Paxil (and they weren't that bad anyways--)It has helped more then the Paxil did and has less side effects. I had dry mouth but drank lots of water and chewed gum-it only lasted about 4 days. Yawned alot for about a week but then  it was gone. Cloudy (Paxil) head was gone within 2 days and now I can really put things into perspective compared to before. I feel stronger emotionally and more in control of situations. I feel human again.Have ringing in my ears still(which Doc says is unrelated--BUT I disagree--it is dealable though if this pill is going to work then I can deal !! Have been on it for 3wks. I haven't been as depressed and so far my anxiety hasn't bothered me. If anything it has made me realize I needed the help and am glad and proud of myself for getting it and the will-power to get more help if needed. Will continue to update.It is important to know that most people do NOT have bad side effects to antidepressants..They can however talk themselves into it by being so nervous of a side effect..I tried to look at it differently..I kept looking for all the good the pill is doing and making me feel rather then any thing possibly bad,which like I said was very minimum and dealable. Give it 1 1/2 wks. and see if it works for you (after all if you have the FLU you are sick that long also so take the pill and wait a week to decided. "

I didn't find that 60mg was any more effective than 40mg so have stuck at 40 for most of the time I have been taking it. 

I was prescribed this drug after taking many other anti-depressants which failed to help my mood, and as anxiety and panic were becoming more prominent in my depression we decided to try Celexa (citalopram). It has helped but only very slightly if I'm honest. I think for people who have mild-moderate depression it would probably be much more effective.

As it turned out I was diagnosed with Bipolar early 2009 and this is probably the reason why it hasn't been so effective for me, but I can confidently say that I have had no bad side effects with Celexa, and have found it one of the easiest SSRI's to tolerate in terms of side effects. 

Even though I have said I haven't noticed a massive difference from it, I have noticed that when I have tried to withdraw from it than my anxiety has become pretty bad again so maybe it has helped slightly more than I give it credit for! Regardless, I plan to continue taking it for the foreseeable future."

1041$Condition: Depression$7/16/2010 11:51:11 AM$Reviewer: beth, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has been the only drug that has ever even touched me for the better. I used to think Paxil worked because I didnt know how much better it could be with celexa but almost immediately I felt like a new and improved girl. I never had a major depressive episode just an underlying dysthymia(low level depression)since high school. I always thought that I was just unhappy and that was that. About 6 years ago I started taking celexa after lexapro made me have zero improvement. The rest is history. The most wonderful drug in the world. Did gain about 10 pounds but that was the beginning and I would rather be 10 pounds heavier and happier then 10 pounds thinner and miserable. Now Im the thinnest I've ever been. I came to the conclusion that when you start taking the celexa you relax and arent as crazy about being a half a pound more. I always thought the other drugs I took(paxil, prozac, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, buspar were working because I used to talk myself into the fact that I felt better when I felt no change. Celexa changed my life and showed me that its ok to try different drug and treatment modalities until something works because this is your life. You are worth it. Being happy is something we all(or at least I)was willing to give-up because I thought something was wrong with me because I never had much of an effect from anything. Take care people and take the time to find something that will help you!

Over the years, this effect gradually waned until it had no effect and switched to other brands. No real effect. Ended up on Zoloft. No help. after being off Celexa a few years, I have started again, hoping for a return of the old magic. Started at 20mg for 2 weeks. Am now on 40mg and will increase to 6omg next week. So far, no noticeable improvement. Will keep it up for a few months. Don't know what I will do then.

1061$Condition: Depression$7/3/2010 11:33:38 AM$Reviewer: Piece of Work, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$3 yrs ago in the midst of an event-induced depression & anxiety, 1st tried Zoloft; no help. Then citalopram (generic) at 20mg.  Almost immediate relief (but event soon concluded, too).  That said, the spiraling, out-of-control despair, dread & nausea stopped.  With citalopram, it felt like I was blocked from obsessing about the recent unendurable concerns (I'll get cancer like my mother, the world is full of incomprehensible suffering, even if things are good for a time they won't last, there's no joy...)-- either I couldn't focus on them anymore or I was on a track where I could not derail into despair.  At the same time, sexual interest declined and even when aroused, I couldn't climax.    BTW, husband has urged me NOT to go off drug.  He said he'd rather give up sex than have to go through my being depressed again!  Dr suggested reducing amount to 5 mg/day.  Sex now is usually better but still infrequent.  Realize menopause could be responsible, too, not to mention boring old routines of a 25 year marriage!  Weight gain-- a little.  Could be menopause, too.   Then again, if the effect of citalopram is to prevent focus on the negative, it stands to reason that it would prevent focus on the positive (sex, getting things accomplished).  There are always trade-offs.

At first I thought it was helping. I had been depressed for so long I don't think I knew what not feeling that way felt like. When my depression is bad I kind of feel like I have blinders on and there is blackness surrounding me, so the fact that that feeling was better I thought the Celexa was working. The longer I took it though, the more I began to realize that was not enough. Plus I wanted to sleep ALL THE TIME.  I would literally sleep all day and still sleep at night. I have back problems and my doctor had prescribed Neurotin and Buspar. These meds made the sleepiness even worse and did little for my back. 
After yet another fight with my husband about the fact that I was never in the mood for sex I begged my doctor to change my meds. She told me to wait another month and see if the sun coming out more now would help. It didn't so I got her to put me on Welbutrin which has helped with my depression and sex drive, but the side effects are really bad, so the search continues for an anti depressant that works and won't hurt my sex drive and doesn't have terrible side effects."

She also taught me a few relaxation exercises to calm down before I lose total control of my anxiety and go into a full panic attack.  Celexa has made me sleepy however, that is not a bad thing; I was unable to get a full night of rest previously.  Now when I wake up during the night, I am able to fall back asleep quickly.  My Dr is going to slowly take me off of Celexa at the end of six months.  I feel so great, I'm kinda afraid to go off the medication.

I was prescribed at least 4 different antidepressants which all made me feel worse.  Than I was prescribed Celexa, I've been taking it for many years, 40mg day.  If I have to go without it while I'm waiting for my prescription by day 3 all of my symptoms are starting to come back.  However the generic Citalopram is useless for me.  I must have the brand.  My insurance pays $2 toward the brand and I end up paying about $220 for a 3 month supply.  Obviously if I could take the generic I certainly would.

I see a MAJOR change in him.  The only problem is the sexual side effect.  He cannot seem to reach orgasm.  Not really a problem for me, but I worry that it may be a lasting effect on him.

On 3rd day I had insomnia due to gastric pain, went to to work & had to leave because I has having weakness, gastritis, nausea, hyperactive bowel sounds, epigastricc pain & heartburn. I had black tarry stools for at least 10-12 hours.The only thing I could eat or drink was ginger ale & crackers. I had to take Maalox at least every 3 hrs due to the burning heartburn & gastric pain. On the fourth day I considered stopping celexa but the doctor was not in her office so I gave it one more chance. I ended up not going to work again due to diarrhea, gastric discomfort not as severe but I'm not eating nothing but crackers, taking maalox every 3 hrs & drinkink ginger ale.

1126$Condition: Depression$5/14/2010 3:36:23 PM$Reviewer: Ricardo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$3$5$This medication has been very effective in relieving my depression and anxiety symptoms. These symptoms became lighter and lighter within 10 days of use.  After 2 weeks, both my anxiety and depression symptoms were completely under control. The only notable side effect has also been the most difficult to deal with. This drug actually prevents me from reaching climax during sexual intercourse. As orgasm approaches, I can literally feel myself hitting an emotional ceiling which prevents me from ejaculating. The amount of direct stimulation required to achieve orgasm greatly exceeds the capabilities of the female vagina; therefore, intense masturbation is the only way for me to achieve orgasm. Even then, the process can take several minutes and often, up to an hour.  This problem started within 10 days of starting my Celexa regimen.  Even when I take only half of the tablet, the emotional barrier is not diminished, and still makes orgasm/ejaculation extremely difficult to achieve.

Took 10mg 2 weeks, then increased to 20 mg. Within a couple days irritability, crying, emotional eating, and mood swings went away. I no longer over-react to things and my constant worrying subsided. It helped my palpatations, but not enough, so now have been put on buspar for that. Had never taken any meds for anxiety/depression before. Only side effects I had was a warming sensation/hotflash for about 1 hr after taking. This only lasted 4 days. I feel citalopram has given me life back.

I take it at night before bed, I am also on Ativan for insomnia and Ibuprofen for joint pain. I can fall asleep fine with this medication but after a few hours I wake up and feel dizzy, it takes me about 2 hours to fall back asleep. Celexa has improved my OCD greatly even at such a low dose, but my anxiety and depression will need a higher dosage to treat. I have high hopes for this drug to work, I have taken wellbutrin and zoloft in the past with horrible side effects.

I'm feeling much better and those around me have noticed too.  I've been taking 20 mgs a day for almost 4 months now.  At first it made me very drowsy and I lost my appetite for about a week.  The side effects subsided after about 2 weeks and everything has been great since then.  I still have emotions, they just aren't so strong and all over the place.  It definitely doesn't make me feel ""doped"" up, just ""normal"".  I feel like I have my life back!!"

I really feel it made me want to drink alcohol and avoid my children.  It helped calm me and not snap at my kids but at the same time I could only deal with them in small spurts.  I would retreat outside to have a drink(alcohol) and a smoke and then come in feeling more able to deal.  I went from a drink during the weekend to everyday.  I'am so glad to be off it although I did it by going cold-turkey and it's made me feel a little lightheaded and I was a bit weepy at first.  I used Prozac 20 years ago for 2 years and that worked fine.  This citalopram makes me feel like I lost about a year of my life.  I did'nt feel present in my life as a wife and mother of 3.  It's been 10 days without it and my urge to drink and smoke cigarettes are gone.  Does anyone have any similiar experience?  I'm just really puzzled and without health insurance a sit down with a doctor is not a possibility.  Hope this helps.

In the 1st 2 wks i experienced nausea (i take it at night before bedtime) and in the morning dizziness upon arising. Both were gone after about two weeks. I also experienced loss of appetite which was gone after a month. Never had any feeling of being in a ""fog"" but it has made me ""not care"", so to speak, about things that were bothering me before. I no longer have a crying ""breakdown"" once a month & my mood swings are gone. My family reports that i seem much happier and less stressed. They like the fact that i no longer yell & am not sad or angry alot. I just like the fact that for the 1st time in years i feel like ""me"" again. I'd recommend the drug & i'd recommend taking it at night if you are worried about side effects.

I take it before bed and i am able to sleep,i can function in life without freaking out and snapping on people for no reason. My sex drive decreased for about six weeks but it has returned to normal, and i had sweating episodes for about a month and that has stopped all together. I did not experience any weight gain,in fact i am losing weight because i actually care enough about myself now to better my life. I had very few side effects and none that were bad. I knew that i had a problem with depression before i was never diagnosed and didn't want to rely on a drug to make me feel better but i had no other choice and i am glad i did. This drug has been an awesome addition to my life and well being! My sister in law is taking celexa as well at the same dosage as i am and had the same side effects and hers has stopped as well and is back to her normal self too. Stick with it the side effects can be annoying but once you get through them you feel alive again! Even if the effects were still present in me i would continue to take this medication. It really works!

Although it has accomplishment the same outcome, an overall better sense of well being, I will say that I believe it takes 2-3 months before you feel the full affect.  I think this time around, I will stay on it as long as I can because it makes a significant impact in the way I prioritize things and the way I assess the impact of things and keeping it in perspective.

Never do that!! Getting back on it feels awful, but taking it continuously really helped improve my mood & overall outlook on life. I fortunately did not gain weight since I was happier & more active. I Had a better self motivation to get out of the bed every morning & much easier time getting along with everyone, especially my co-workers since I work in a stressful environment, the ER. I had tried other antidepressants that just did not agree with me or made me feel as if I was walking around in a fog. But once I started taking celexa, I had no real side effects & I actually started to be able to live my life without the high stress levels, & my OCD accompanied with anxiety has been at an all-time low. I can say I am very satisfied :)

After a few weeks it got better and now i dont experiance the side effects anymore.  it has really helped my mood swings, and has allowed me to let the 'little' things go. Tho, at first that was hard for me because i wouldnt get upset over the things i used to get upset about and that would frusterate me. But eventually i learned that i was alright.

It certainly made my relationship with my wife, two young children, and my mother less than enjoyable, to put it mildly. I enjoy music again, and laugh a lot more. Gaining and maintaining a healthy looking weight has always been tough for me. I look better a little heavier and Celexa has increased my appetite and allowed me to gain 15 much needed pounds (I'm 170# now). I don't get NEARLY as upset at life's challenges. I started with 20 mg for about 3 months, but increased to 40mg and feel a lot better. I came off the meds for about 6 months and the old angry me came back. Oh well...whatever it takes for improve the LIFE experience. The only significant side effect I have is the ability to achieve orgasm. Erection is no prob but the O seems next to impossible. I tried wellbutrin for a few weeks to help with the O's but seemed to experience more aggression, so I quit that. Aside from that...this stuff is heaven sent.

I first started taking it in the morning and noticed that it caused blurry vision, constant yawning and overall exhaustion...I then began taking it at night which turned out to be ok. After 2 months I lost 20lbs and actually felt better...Major side effect would be loss of libido...my sex drive that was already low because of depression and anxiety became non existent because of celexa.

I went to a doctor about my insomnia & ended up at the campus psych clinic. The doc there put me on Celexa for a mood disorder. I still had insomnia, but Celexa seemed to help in other ways at first. Then came the apathy. I didn't care about anything. I stopped cleaning the house. I would forget to eat. I could have an orgasm, but didn't want to be bothered with sex. I had no concept of dates or deadlines. I almost failed out of grad school because I just didn't give a damn. Physically the worst thing were the jaw problems. Jaw clenching is a known side effect. Mine was so bad I ended up with TMJ. I was in constant pain and in the end I couldn't open my mouth over an inch wide. The pain lessened when I stopped Celexa. I still can't fully open my mouth, but it is slowly getting better. 
My 'whatever attitude' has also slowly improved. 
I still go to the same doctor & we are exploring other options. (Now if I could only get some sleep.)

Switched to Lexapro.  Felt better within a week and a half.  Much less anxiety, less depression, did not crave the caffeine to get my head out of the ""fog"".     "

1291$Condition: Depression$12/18/2009 1:40:59 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$I started taking celexa after a separation from my husband. After we seperated I was mildly depressed and I couldn't do much because I felt like I was in a fog. I couldn't concentrate on anything. Thinking was a major chore. It was horrible. I was put on celexa and felt better within a week or two because I was able to think clear. However I still felt depressed and unmotivated, but at least now I could think better. Another reason I didn't care for it is because it made me really anxious. I suffered from some anxiety before and this seemed to not help with anxiety. I was nervous alot of the time, my jaw was clenching, and the main thing I couldn't tolerate this drug was because of the major neck pain. It was hard for me to fall asleep because of my neck pain which started within a day of taking celexa. I say if you have anxiety, this might not work for you, but everyone is different. I read alot of the reviews and it seems it worked for alot of people, but not for me. I am trying Lexapro next.

My head is much more clear and feels so much better.  I also feel much less anxious and frazzled.  The dysthymia (low grade depression) has not lifted much.

At any rate, it got me through a very rough time and helped me get back in control of my life.

I have three wonderful children and an amazing husband. I NEVER thought people should take medication that ""took away"" from how they felt. After all, our emotions are what make us human, they are what determines who we are through how we act. I didn't feel comfortable addmitting I needed help, however, someone recomended I see a doctor for something just to ""take the edge off."" I do have a ""stress-related"" job, and was always either snappy or over-reacting to situations. This medicine has been a God-send. I am still me, I feel every emotion, and at the same time, I think more clearly therefore I process it better and more accurately. I have never tried any medication like this before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I know it works for me. I am SO thankful to my doctor who has helped improve my intire life with this medication. I started taking it for 2 weeks just a half of pill a day, then we increased the dosage to a full pill after the two weeks. I have been on it for a little over a month and not only did I notice a huge change, but so has everyone else-with all the feedback being positive. I can only tell the women thinking about this, or maybe you haven't thought about it but someone has mentioned it to you, you won't believe how entirely you can still feel like yourself, while at the same time your life has changed so dramatically! For the woman who has SO much going on, work, husband, children, home, errands, this just places things into focus, and allows you to prioritize without anxiety. Good luck and God Bless."

I was wound up very tight and feeling like I was going to explode. Simple pleasures were really non-existent. Immediately relaxed me and I began to feel more in control, and I could think more clear and rational. Side effects were insomnia, brief stomach cramps, nervousness ( better than panic attacks anyday), and tiredness, which is a bit frustrating being unable to sleep. Felt a little groggy the next morning, but again, better than wandering the halls all night with my mind racing. Got the sleep I needed though. Thankful my doctor prescribed.

Starting the fourth week I begin to become depress all over again but this time I was having suicidal thoughts.  The doctor wanted me to stay on the medication for another month at that dosage.  Before my next visit I was thinking about suicide and contacted my therapist to see if I could see a doctor.  She told me my doctor was out of the country and would not be back for 1 week. I saw my doctor on November 30, 2009 and he increased my dosage to 40mg at night. I am scared that the 40mg dose will do good for about 3 weeks then the depression will come back. Upon research I noticed there is 60mg dosages but right now I feel as I am going backwards instead of forwards. For your information I also take Geodon 80mg twice a day, Gabapentin 300mg twice a day and Ativan 1mg twice a day.

The last one is what I'd heard was the biggest problem, but not for me. My wife and I are very active and that hasn't changed. In fact my improved temperament has probably helped our intimacy overall. Very happy with this med.  It is the first I have ever tried.

Before Celexa, I had severe depression and extreme anxiety that would merge into full blown panic attacks. Celexa has been a life saver for me. The effectiveness has, of course, worn off some because I have taking it for so long but I refuse to taper off of it. I do not want to experience the severe depression and anxiety that I once experienced a long time ago. I do feel depressed at the moment and have anxiety as well (It has lost it's effectiveness), so my doctor has also prescribed me Xanax as needed and another anti-depressant called Pristiq. I have only tried Prestiq for 5 days but already do not like the extremely negative side effects I am experiencing so I plan to stop taking this. The Xanax has helped tremendously with my anxiety. I wished I could just keep increasing the MG of Celexa, but my doctor told me I am maxed out. I may research this and see how many MG is the max for this medication. Oh yeah, this medication has not caused any major side effects for me, even in the beginning. My sex drive is still as great as ever.

Before I started taking it, I wouldn't get out of bed unless I absolutely had to. As a matter of fact, I almost rescheduled the appointment I had to get on this because I was ""too tired to go"" I take it before bed, which helps me sleep. Sometimes Im a little nautious in the morning, but that goes away with food. My sex drive is GONE ( if someone sees it please return it) Ha ha. Overall I will continue to take it. My mood has greatly improved and im back to ""normal"" again. I feel fantastic. "

I do also know that depression runs in my family.  I have the type of nature that tries to deal with everything and was in denial that I needed any help of a medication.  People tell me that I have a calm demeanor and could not tell that I had been suffering inside.  I persistently dealt with it and now that I am on Celexa I definitely feel the difference.  I have been on it for about 3 years and started when I was experiencing extreme work related stress. On top of that I was experiencing menopause.  Then I lost my mother and have remained on it.  I was first put on Lexapro but it had an emotionally numbing effect on me. I have none of that with Celexa.  I am glad to find something without harsh side effects to my system.  I take it at night before I go to bed.  20 mg. Don't deny yourself the help you may need like I did for so many years.  Take care of yourself.  Talk to your doctor.  I hope this information helps someone. "

Scared me so badly that I quit taking the prescription for two months.  Just re-started two weeks ago, was cutting the 20mg dose into half and then half again!, and this made my side-effects less acute.  It will take me longer to get to where I am hoping to be with my depression, but the panic attacks aren't worth it. Just increased to 10mg two days ago and last night had an awful time trying to fall asleep - racing thoughts, anxiety...the scariest part was the feeling of heat through my chest, arms and face (like an acute hot flash or sunburn?).  It actually woke me up several times, this hot-flash symptom, and I would be drenched in sweat....wondering if anyone else had this side-effect too? I am hopeing that it goes away soon!  Had such good luck with my last anti-depressant but it's $90 more a month than Celexa.  Am looking foward to ""sunnier""-feeling days!"

Make sure that you have an understanding partner before you begin treatment. I have also run into another complication – anxiety. This is something new to me since I almost never experienced it, but as of right now it’s a daily occurrence.

I'm a male in my 20s, a hypochondriac with severe anxiety disorder. Before taking this drug I would drive myself to the ER consistently thinking I was having a heart attack. Also a major fear of vomiting - the slightest stomach ache or indigestion would send me over the edge, and I would be petrified, literally shaking and trembling all over. I began seeing a psychiatrist and he put me on Celexa. I have seen a major, major difference .. although, like I said, I'd give it a 90% overall.. I still get nervous every once in a while about vomiting, and I'll have to leave work or drive myself to my 'comfort zone' (aka - home).  But this happens maybe once every three months - as oppose to every day!!  I can live normally again thanks to this drug. I strongly suggest taking it consistently at the SAME TIME every day.  This will increase its effectiveness. I felt a little dizzy when I first starting taking it but that went away in about a week. Lost my sex drive for a few weeks but then it came back in full force (thankfully!)  Give it a chance, don't let the side effects scare you - they are very mild. Doesn't bother my stomach at all.  If I skip a day or two, and resume, I'll feel the effects about 2 or 3 days later, strangely enough - i'll get a dizzy spell and a mild panic attack, or get depressed (feel like crying and be fearful of losing my parents - very weird).  I might be a kook with all of my anxieties, etc, but celexa allows me to hide them in front of others.  Great drug overall.

I feel as antsy as ever, high levels of anxiety, even more intense fear of socializing, ocd, boredom etc..Basically exactly the way I felt right before I went on it lol. So, while Im not in worse shape, def. not feeling better. The most prominant side effect has been on my sleeping patterns. Been waking up waay earlier than normal/before totally wired. Only reason I get back to sleep is from generic Ambien (take 1/2 with the Celexa b4 bed, then the other 1/2 when I wake up in the very early a.m). If not for that extra 1/2 pill, 4get it lol! Strangely, my sex drive has NOT really been effected. Bottom line, very ineffective for me. I feel flat at best. Gonna decrease off it asap.

A littel advertised side effect is ""disinhibition"". This caused me to make inappropriate comments and swear more etc...very weird! Unfortunately I lost my job over it before I discovered the cause and stopped taking the drug. When I stopped I found I was not depressed as badly as when I was on it and the anxiety had gone as well... this drug can be useful for short term use prior to counselling to deal with rather than bury the issues. I was also suffering from what is quaintly called ""suicidal ideation"" as I was convinced my family would be better off without me...really bad shit I think you'll agree! The reason for the disinhibition is that serotonin (which this drug increases in the brain to make you happier allegedly) is involved in your internal behaviour regulation. Really look out for this and the suicidal thoughts if you are taking this stuff esp long term.. at least it didn'tmake me sweat as much as Prozac did! good luck out there everyone."

I began it in June 09 at 20mg because I was feeling sad and depressed out of the blue.. Have never had depression ever before. So De. says try this.. After a week, I felt nausea constantly-felt just ill. By week 2- I began having ear pain and headaches with the nausea/loss of appetite and most days felt unable to function- went to Dr to see if I had ear infection. No-- asked if it could be the meds. Again NO..By week 3- I had lost 24 pounds. I was then waking up with indigestion (mind you I was barely eating), constant nausea, fatigue, headaches, feeling of absolute illness- Went again to Dr. asking is this the meds doing this..Again NO.  Began getting freaked that I had some sort of disease that I was gonna die or something. Spent most days on couch, sick as hell. Finally week 4-more weight loss, feeling weird crazy thoughts, didnt trust myself, afraid- worried, felt like I was going insane and this with all the physical complaints. At end of Week 4, I said I quit this med.  I stopped it, went to see my hemotologist in tears begging him to see if I had cancer or something (brain tumor) because I have never had headaches like that ever. Told him about the Celexa  and that the day before I stopped taking them. He looked at me and said, IT IS the MEDS..Told me about the half life and give it time to get out of my system. Sure enough less than one week later, I felt 100 times better. He offered for me to try Wellbutrin but I was super afraid of the same thing happening. So I declined. However again about 2 weeks ago began feeling sad, depressed, weird gloomy out of the blue--all my blood hormone tests are normal- so called the  Hemotologist and saw him. began taking the Wellbutrin 150 about 4 days ago. The only thing I noticed I felt a little better, some energy,little irritable today..Will see how it goes. I am taking a half dose of .5mg of xanax as well, since I am nervous about the side effect

I am at work where we get internet access. My wife is 32 yo has been  diagnosed with PTSD, Bi-Polar, multi-personality disorder, anxiety, hypo thyroid disease, and depression. She is on abilify, clonazepam, levothyroxin. She was taking nerotriptilyn to help with sleep disorder but was removed from this and incresed the clonazepam at night. Been on Celexa for just over a week. At first she was tired all the time (was taking meds at night), then switched to mornings. That day she sleept all day long. Since that day, she has been not sleeping that long. She is smiling more and less talk about how she wants life to end or dwelling on the anxiety of life. She yawns a lot, but that is becoming less. The biggest problem she feels (and this is coming from her) is that she has a lack of sexual desire specifically decresed interest in sex and sexual ability. This fact is giving her a whole new and other reason for being depressed because sex is a part of our marriage that we both love. So has any married couples experienced this and have the sexual effects balanced out. Celexa works awesom for my wife, she has such a beautiful smile and laugh. I am falling in love with her all over again and it is great, just want the ""other"" effects to stop. "

Lexapro had really helped me with my depression, but it was too expensive ($93/month) and it raised my sex drive very high. My sex drive is normally good, but on Lexapro it felt like I was 15 again-which sounds great, but it was very distracting to say the least. 
So I switched to Celexa. The only effect I liked was a normal to at times, a reduced libido, which felt alright.
The other side effects were awful: headaches, very tired, irritable, and, worst of all, brain ""fog' all day. My memory was just shot, because of the fog- far worse than anything I'd experienced before I'd taken any anti-depressants. 
I'm switching to a different med today once I hear back from my doctor's office, for hopes of a better outcome. Just a note to consult your dr when you switch medications, I made the mistake of not letting them know what I was going through and stopped cold turkey a few days ago. Now I'm even more irritable and my wife's not too happy with me, to say the least.  "

Have tried Lexapro, Effexor and  Wellbutrin in the past for a very short time frame, all 3 gave me excrutiating headaches so I stopped taking them, not to mention severe anxiety and a general 
""weirded out"" feeling.
Have been taking Celexa 10mg for about 3 weeks now. I can tell you that I have not had headaches with the 10mg. My doctor wants to bump me up slowly to 20 or 40 mg, however, when I took 15mg, the headache was unbearable. My doctor suggested that I take it with two tylenols, which so far has been helpful. Haven't noticed a huge improvement in the depression, but I would say I am hopeful. Also, after reading some reviews, I started taking Celexa at night, so I am not groggy durig the day.
As a side note, I am also someone who eats very healthy, works out daily and has a lot of family support. Thus, I hope that I will be able to be on Celexa long enough to dig out of what I like to call my depression, ""the black hole"". 
Trust me, if you are sensitive to medications in general, especially AntiDepressants, Celexa may work for you. I pray that someone reads this and find it helpful!!"

This time it didn't seem to be working.  I also was hit with overwhelming anxiety because of my husband's job difficulties.  The doctor prescribed Celexa a couple of months ago.  After 3 weeks, I was ready to give up on this because it took longer to kick in than Zoloft. I also had terrible dry mouth and food just didn't taste good. But the Dr. bumped me up to 60 mg. and that really did the trick.  I only have dry mouth when I first wake up in the AM and food tastes good again.  My hubby said that on Zoloft I was more ""flat emotioned"" but on the Celexa, I have the normal ups and downs that everyone else has.  The only negative is that I am on the tired side, but not terribly bad.  It is a lot better than wanting to jump in front of a bus.  The best part is that a one month supply is only $4 at Walmart.  I urge everyone to give this a try and stick with it.  Good luck!"

It got to the point where I attempted suicide. I was having at least one big panic attack a day, couldn't handle crowds, all that junk. I couldn't take it anymore.
I was hospitalized and put on Wellbutrin and Ativan. These made things a ton worse - I couldn't handle anything. I would break down if I someone looked at me funny, and I went days at a time without sleep. I ended up taking every pill I had, trying to make it stop. Needless to say, I was hospitalized again and taken off those meds pretty quick.
Then I was given Celexa and oh my god, the panic and depression stopped. Not immediately, but it helped a lot. I could handle being inside again, with other people. Loud noises slowly stopped bothering me. Had it not been too late, I'd have fought my discharge (the paperwork had all gone through while I was in the hospital, and I left about a week later), because I was getting back to my normal self.
I haven't experienced any weight gain, except from the normal being home and not exercising and eating junk food. At first, the pills made me manic and jittery - I felt like I'd drunk about six cups of strong coffee in one go for the entire day, and couldn't wind down without taking a sedative. I normalized after a couple weeks. Celexa has worked out awesomely for me."

I had tried approx 6-7 other AD's, but to no avail. Some AD's did nothing to lessen the feelings of despair while some just seemed to worsen my condition. With this in mind, I resigned myself to the fact that I must continue to suffer the rest of my life,with this debilitating disease. Approx. 3 1/2 weeks ago, I relented and had asked my Dr. if I could try-(after 5 years of suffering w/o any meds), ""Celexa"". He agreed and put me on 20mg, 1x day. In the first week,I could feel a difference, a positive difference. 3 weeks later, Celexa has made a significant change with not only how I feel but also, my outlook on life.I can only conclude,that not only have I found ""the one""-(Celexa), but with the help of your ""readers reviews"" and their experiences while using this drug, I have a renewed outlook on life, and freedom for the first time from horrible and debilitating disease! I often would say, ""how much more can one endure""?! Well, no more. There is indeed, light at the end of the tunnel! Thank you readers and Good Luck to all!"

1455$Condition: Depression$8/4/2009 9:08:42 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$5$"My wife was hospitalized with jaundice/anemia. It was determined that she almost had kidney failure and was in the hospital for 2 weeks. The next step was rehab in nursing home environment. Prior to leaving the hospital she was placed on Celexa for depression. This was continued at the nursing home. Her mental state has deteriorated to the point that she can no longer walk or feed herself. A blood test indicted an extremely high level of ammonia and Lactulose has been prescribed and started. Hopefully this will help her situation.
Since she had history of both 
kidney and liver problems I don't believe that Celexa should ever have been prescribed. How can I protect my wife from this kind of obvious error?"

In the last year my panic was daily, buckled up and saw a psychiatrist who had me try this since I was NOT happy with the side effects of Paxil. Paxil made me feel like a zombie, but this did the exact opposite - made my panic so bad that even on 1mg (.5 xanax twice a day) I could not function. Had to quit after just 3 days of this. Don't want to have to pop xanax daily as it loses effectiveness, going to possibly try Zoloft next.

Had the yawning/drymouth/sleep issues the first 2 weeks, but since then, things have been great. No more paranoid feelings and anxiety at night. I don't wig out on my family anymore. I had to play around with they time of day to take it, because at first it would make me sleepy, so I took it at night, but then couldn't sleep, so I take it at lunch now. I highly recommend it for someone like me, mild depression and anxiety. I also have found that it's ok for me to have a few beers with friends. I even got drunk one night, but no bad side effects. This drug does help with working with difficult co-workers also, I have found myself much more pleasant with the people I can't stand at work.

For 4 of those months I continued to self-medicate with marijuana on and off (hoping that the meds would be enough to help me quit, after two weeks, I no longer was able to hold out). I took 20mg for one week and then upped to 40mg ever since. In the beginning it made me dizzy and very tired. The drowsiness never subsided which is why I switched to taking it at night and have been ever since. When I had finally been able to stop smoking marijuana 4 months later, my anxiety had subsided and my depression blew up big time. I had many crying spells. I could not concentrate. I was very lethargic, as I had been the entire time, and the celexa was not helping that. What I needed was energy. I stopped taking the pill today with instructions from my doctor to switch immediately to 150mg of Effexor (which I'm pretty nervous about...) and the withdrawal effects I had were: vertigo, sweating, crying, severe depression. Celexa works for many people. It helped me out in the beginning, as it was the first time I had ever been on an antidepressant. But it never was consistent for me, and in the end my depression became unacceptable and the Celexa was doing nothing to help.

Trouble breathing pressure in the eyes dream like state and every time i cough it makes me gag. THe side effects are not worth it for me, but meds work differently for different people.

1491$Condition: Depression$7/7/2009 1:32:18 PM$Reviewer: RogerBaran, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I like this drug much better than Paxil. I have been on Celexa now for over 2 years and noticed improvement right away: Time didn't seem so collapsed -- I had ""room to think"" and a lot less ""knee jerk"" reactions to situations. 

My only concern is when I forget to take it -- the pressure in my head builds substantially and I feel very fatigued. However, with that warning sign I remember to take it immediately and I am ok again within an hour or so. If I don't take it for some reason (away from the house) then I seem to release the ""Darth Vader"" in me and I can become pretty unpleasant -- to anyone who happens to be around me at the time.

I have remedied the above situation by setting a special ringtone to an alarm on my cellphone. It goes off every day at 7:00am. When I hear that special ring I know to check myself to see if I have taken my medications.

Overall, I really like the way Celexa helps me manage life; way better than before. I also benefit from the return of my sex drive; which was almost totally gone while using paxil. All of the other drugs that I sampled seemed to have side effects that were unpleasant in one way or another. Not Celexa. It comes on mild from the start and smooths out the path quite nicely. By the third week or so I knew that I would stick with this drug."

1511$Condition: Panic Disorder$6/20/2009 3:22:38 PM$Reviewer: WorldTraveler, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Over the past few years I developed a fear of falling, the phobia increased so that I was holding on to walls within our home, unable to walk to my car, even with 2 canes, petrified in parking lots, even with a shopping card.  A psychiatrist put me on 5 mg. 2x a day, but the AM dose left me too groggy, the 5 mg. PM dose gave me the kind of sleep I haven't had since I was a teenager (deep, wonderful dream-filled sleep).  After 3 weeks, my anxiety began to lesson, after 6 weeks I was walking around not holding onto walls.  It has changed me life.  I'm calmer & the little stuff doesn't bother me any more.  The 10 lb. I gained after breaking my back, I can't seem to lose, so weight loss is harder, my strong libido is nearly non-existent, but I don't care, I'm not filled with dread & anxiety.  I'm not worried all the time.  Close friends have noticed these changes.  After 9 months, I have no plans to discontinue it.  Some of the night sweats others are feeling are probably peri-menopause.  It is hard on the stomach, I took it with 2 75 mg. Zantac for the first 2 weeks, then 1 Zantac for another 2 weeks, now my stomach is used to it.  I take it before bedtime.  So the nausea others have experienced might be alleviated by taking it with a Zantac because Celexa is an acidic drug.  5 mg. works so well for me, I'm incredulous as to the high doses that others are on.  It does take 6 weeks for the full effect, so be paient.

I can't get up too quickly or even move my head too fast without feeling dizzy. Plus even if it was better for my depression my sex life with my husband sucked!! Over all I think that it worked only in my head because I so needed something to work at the time. The side effects are not worth it. The way I feel after only 2 days off of it are just nut's.

I have energy, feel happy, I actully want to do things. I haven't felt this good in years. I didn't reliaze how bad I was on the Paxil or how bad the side effect were until I was off of it. I feel like a new person. I have tried SO many script in the past 13 years and nothing has helped me feel like my self the way Celexa has. I know that I am still new on the medication, so far so great! It has really given me life back.

1516$Condition: Depression$6/17/2009 12:29:55 PM$Reviewer: KMartin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"4 years on Celexa.  It stopped the intense, uncontrolable, non-stop sobbing.  This drug tamed the excessive ruminating.  My angry, impatient, always-irritable personality was replaced with a sweet mellowness. My suicidal ideations ended. 
I took this medicine because of some very seriously painful life events. 
This drug saved my life.
The initial side effects: tense jaw, yawning, insomnia, and others, went away fairly quickly.  Celexa kicked in within a week.  This medicine numbed my horribly raw, painful, extremely depressed feelings. I could not stop crying, for literally a year before starting Celexa.  My ruminating was like torture.  I was wonderfully mellow and fairly happy once again.
Long term effects included being pretty much emotionless.  I could not cry even if I wanted to.  My passionate, creative characteristics faded away.  I loved to sleep. My ambitions waned. I was definitely sugar coated and in my own little content, semi-zombie world.  But, I really needed that at the time....really, really needed it.
I think I gained some weight too while on Celexa.  Hard to pinpoint exactly why.
I decided to stop Celexa just 2 1/2 weeks ago.  I am thinking that I might be able to, maybe, not need it anymore.  I am going to try anyway. I want to get some of my old ambition back...my creativity....I miss the good intense feelings of love for my family.  I was kind of flat when it came to that. I was on 40 mg...Took 20mg for a week...then 10 mg for 3 days...now, zero meds. It was easy at first. Now, the brain zaps, whooshes are plentiful.  I feel sad and teary at times.  But that is ok...I am not afraid to cry....I think I just need to get used to emotions again.  I was very nauseous the first 10 days.  That is gone now.  I do have to stomach cramps now.  I am irritable, very tired, and just don't feel so great, overall.  But I am hoping all this will ease away eventually.  I sure am going to give it a good shot!  Quiting smoking was much harder!! LOL!

Everyday I feel sad.  I watch commercials and start to cry.  I feel exhausted too AND I have gained at least 10LBS.  It wasn't this bad towards the end of using Paxil.  I am not sure what I may need, but I think I know that this isn't it.  It has been over a month now and up to a dosage of 40.  I don't think I want to stay on it.

I started on 20mg a day and after 3 weeks got upped to 40mg. I use to be very anxious and I guess depressed. I had intense mood changes as well. When i was on the 20mg my anxiety was more or less gone but my depression and mood was still the same. Ive been on 40mg for about a week and a half now and feel amazing! I havent felt this great in years. And I've lost 9 lbs! I know everyones experiences are different but I found it helpful to read reviews when I first started.

As for side effects for the first week i felt like absolute crap. Headache, sick, no appetite what so ever, shaky, kind of tippy on my feet...but those have faded. I do have a little bit of a metallic taste in my mouth at times but nothing unbearable...

Good luck and I hope this helps"

It caused horrendous side effects  and I ended up in the ER after taking it for 17 days (doc said it would all be better after two weeks). I was out sick from work for two week in an attemp to get adjusted to the med. It caused severe night sweeats, sleep disturbance, worsened the anxiety to the point of my brain being completely manic/aggitated and could not concentrate on the minor of things (TV!). It was explained to me by a psych doctor, after the fact, that the reason I had this reaction is because the med is for anxiety AND depression. Since I did not suffer from depression it simply added 'gasoline to the fire' by speeding up my brain - tenfold! Worse than any anxiety I have EVER experienced! I am now on Buspar and have not experienced any side effects.

1529$Condition: Depression$6/8/2009 11:19:40 AM$Reviewer: NeverAgain, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$2$5$After being diagnosed with a chronic illness I suffered from extreme depression and was prescribed 20mg of Celexa which seemed to work initially.  No sexual interest.  Unable to maintain erection.  Also made me unable to climax.  Eventually the medication seemed to stop working, so my Dr. prescribed 40mg.  Didn't notice much difference other than my abililty to climax returned but my interest in sex is NOT there.  I haven't been able to have sex in a year.  To aide the celexa, and after a suicide attempt, my Dr. also prescribed 150mg of wellbutrin.  This combo proved to be effective for a while with me taking the celexa at bedtime and the wellbutrin in the morning. Eventually that became less effective also so my wellbutrin dosage was increased to 300mg (2 150mg tablets) and I was advised to taper off of celexa by taking 1/2 a tablet at bedtime for a week, then 1/2 tablet every other day.  My withdrawls have been pretty bad...I experience muscle tremors, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, loss of appetite, headaches, and an inability to focus because of the symptoms.  I would recommed exhausting every possible avenue to treat depression without medication because eventually you're left over-medicated, and miserable because of side effects or withdrawls.  I plan to continue tapering off of celexa and then work at tapering off of wellbutrin.  I'm also planning to find a new therapist or some sort of support group, and start going back to church because I still don't feel like I'm living.  I seriously hope something I've said resonates, and helps someone to make an informed decision about their own treatment options.  Gotta go lie down because I just vomitted and my head is pounding.  BE WISE and BE WELL!!!

My md wants me to stay on it for at least 10 days to give it a fair trial; but I'm not so sure.    I don't like the way I am feeling and certainly don't want to get any worse.   I only wanted to feel better and be able to cope with stressful situation; that is the reason for starting this med.  (never been on this type of drug before -- only tranquilizer)

1532$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/4/2009 3:07:40 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$Status migrainosous was my original diagnosis with overwhelming stress as the primary factor. The Celexa was prescribed to help me get the repeated anxiety under control. As it was very effective, the Celexa really calmed me down to the point where I was to take every other night and now I'm not supposed to take it anymore. I took Celexa for 3 months and am now three days off the drug. I can feel the difference the Celexa made with the treatment of the debilitating migraines. I did suffer with low libido but all SSRI's have this side effect and that was something I could temporarily live with, as long as I didn't have to stay on the medication too long. The decreased dosage to every other day helped with this side effect only a little. Regardless, the Celexa was very effective in the treatment of my anxiety portion of status migrainosous. However when you come off Celexa (like it says), you will have headaches until your body re-adjusts to life without Celexa. I hope I re-adjust soon. Although the anxiety has been reduced with the help of Celexa and stress counseling, the migraines I took it for have come back in force. Not good! My doctor was trying to get me down to 8 migraines a month; I've taken my migraine medicine now 4 times in 3 days. To let you know, however, status migrainosous is very rare and most migraine sufferers will not have to use this product.

While on celexa I felt numb and very much unlike myself. I was on anti-anxiety meds for one year and decided to go off them due my complete lack of interest in sex and didn't want to deal with what I was experiencing for the rest of my life. I kept thinking there has to be a better way and I tapered off over a 4 week period. Getting off celexa was one of the worst exp. of my life. I had headaches, brain zaps, I was sick to my stomach, nauseous all the time and had horrible mood swings for two full months. About three months after I stopped I had a horrible emotional break down. I was at my wits end and hit the internet to research natural ways to calm me down. After trying 5-htp (which helped a little) my boyfriend mentioned magnesium deficiency. I did a little research on the symptoms and found that all my symptoms pointed towards this. Muscle tension, anxiety and horrible obsessive thoughts, insomnia, etc. After I did a little research on which brand of mag. to buy, I decided on ""Slow Mag"". I took 4 tabs a day, two in the morning on an empty stomach and two in the evening on an empty stomach. I felt more relaxed and calm within a few hours of taking my first dose; my muscle tension seemed to just melt away. I've been taking slow mag everyday for a few weeks now and I have not felt this good in years! All symtomps I mentioned above are GONE!!! I urge everyone to please, please try mag first before giving in to the drugs our doctors push on us. Magnesium test are rarely able to detect a deficiency, so just give it a try and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! There is a large majority of people with this deficiency and don't know it. If you decide to give mag a try, please research brands and make sure you buy a quality supplement that includes calcium. I want to help as many people as I can, you don’t have to be a zombie!

During the holidays in 2008 I had severe depression and felt utterly hopeless.  After a lot of trial and error, I am presently on 80mg of Celexa, 30mg of Cymbalta, all of which are taken in the morning.  I take Xanax at .25 for public speaking or for situations that I know will be stressful in advance.

Normally I do pretty well with this combination.  Lately though I have been so tired during the day that I have trouble getting out of bed and staying at work: I want to just sleep until I have had my fill.  Not as in the mood for sex as I used to be which is just fine with my wife.  Given being overly tired/feeling overly exhausted versus being severely depressed, I'll take the exhaustion.  As someone who is suffering from depression, it would be nice to have something without all the side effects."

Combined with CBT, celexa has brought me down to 10-20 panic attacks a year, as opposed to 10-20 a day. It sedates me a bit, and inspite of diet and exercise I have gained 50lbs on it. Like others have mentioned it has caused increased sweating, dry mouth, slightly decreased sex drive. On the upside,unless i tell them nobody would ever know i suffered from any mental illness. I also responded well for years to Desipramine, ok to lexapro, poorly to prozac, wellbutrin, topamax,and when unmedicated (by choice) found st. John's Wort to be slightly helpful (might help a person with less severe conditions). I would recommend Celexa in spite of some of the bothersome side effects, especially when the alternative in being so seriously ill as to be unable to work, eat, leave the house, socialize, sleep, drive, or even think ""clearly"". I would say it is one of the more tolerable medications."

Like so many of the strong people on here, I was fighting for my life with all of the anxiety I had encountered. My doctor prescribed Celexa and Ativan, and let me just say that it really helped me get back on my feet. I was really worried heading back to college that there was no way I'd be able to make it through, but after about a week and a half, closer to two weeks, the celexa began to take effect. For me, and I am the very like cautious and judgemental type, I noticed that the Celexa was helping in the little ways that made a huge difference in my daily lifestyle. In situations when I had normally broken down, I kept my cool and made it through. I would recommend this to anyone who is patient enough to let this drug take its effect in the body system. Since I got on Celexa, 20mg a day, my life has been manageable, something I would never have imagined possible after my rapid onset of panic attacks towards the end of my fall semester in college. A final note though to anyone who does decide to try this medication, it does prompt the ocassional bout of brain fog. You get used to it eventually, but it at times makes you a little ""too out of it."" Just avoid caffeine at all costs, its not a good component for someone using this medication- makes you ansy. Hope this helps someone."

So what is being treated now?  Not the depression, but anxiety attacks.  This drug was not a good fit for me, but everyone is different.

I feel normal.  My anxiety levels feel normal.  I experienced some trouble sleeping at the start but now I have not trouble.  Sweating is a little bit of a problem.  It is not all the time, but I will start to sweat a great deal with little effort such as sweeping the kicthen floor.  Willing to deal with it due to how much better I feel.  I experience some headachs at the start and blurred vision, only lasted a week or so.  Not serious.  Continue to get minor headachs, do not know if attribuated to medication or not.

I did feel tired at first also, but I now take the celexa at night and feel fine throughout the day. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has anxiety issues. Do not let the first day discourage you, stick to it and it should help.

I have been on this pill for about three weeks and have seen its benefits work right off the bat for me. My family repeatedly says to me about this ""glow"" they keep seeing on my face and how I seem to look more ""peaceful"" since my Celexa therapy began. Personally, I have more energy, am able to concentrate better at work and am more chipper than I used to be in the past. I have been researching this drug right after I started taking it and read about the many different ways people react to it. I have had some sexual side effects (that would be the only drawback), but they turned out to be not as bad as I initially thought. Furthermore, this drug has also helped me with overeating secondary to the anxiety. I am not sure there is such a thing as the ""perfect drug"", but I think Celexa comes pretty close to it. "

Over the last year I have had severe depression; sad, crying for no reason, just unhappy almost all of the time. I have tried everything. The doctor had me on Cymbalta for the depression and the Celexa for the overall anxiety. The doctor has been migrating me from Cymbalta to Wellbutrin. I am presently on 80mg of the Celexa. I take one pill in the morning and one in the evening.  I did this because I was having severe afternoon headaches by taking all 80mgs in the AM. I still have occasional headaches though.

I see a common thread in reading the reviews that insomnia is a side effect.
Amen to that. I have tried Lunesta, Advil PM, Tylenol PM, Benadryl and supplementing these with Melatonin and it is like I have taken nothing at all for sleep. I have mornings where I can't get up and I have to sleep in because of the insomnia. Anyone have any ideas?

The first day I was shaky (hadn't been on medication for 4 years, which could be the reason). I expressed my concern for horrible side effects and was given 10MG to start. Shaky and a little sick the first day, but the next couple days were fine! I get a little tired, but it could be all the energy, and everything i have been able to do! I haven't felt like myself in years, and i'm finally back to normal! Very happy with the results so far!

When I do feel depressed now (rarely) it seems to be a bit more intense than before I began celexa, then again It's the middle of winter in Maine so who wouldn't be violently depressed.

I was less stressed, didn't contemplate negative thoughts as often, and was overall a more ""happy"" person.  I quote happy because it has always been my belief that depression is cause by actual occurrences in life, and the only way to truly cure yourself of depressive thoughts is to face the things that are difficult to face and ""take care of them"" thoroughly.  I feel that the drug simply makes things ""easier to deal with"" than it actually makes you happy or less depressed.  However, after nearly 3 months of drug therapy, I crashed very hard.  No suicidal thoughts, but I was ready to quit my job and divorce my wife even though we have three small children.  This episode didn't last even 24 hours, but it was one of the worst I had experience in my life.  This drug also made me extremely tired.  I simply could not get enough sleep almost as if I were a teenager once again.  After my ""crash"", I went off of the drug completely cold turkey.  During the first week being off of the drug, I felt almost drunk or high with a fuzzy state of mental being and a constant woozy feeling in my head.  During the second week, I suffered what I will call ""brain zaps"", nothing painful but once every 1-2 minutes I would get a quick ""unbalanced"" feeling in my head that would last no more than a second.  It is now early in my third week of being off of the drug, and the brain zaps are waning, but my feeling of lack of good sleep is still very persistent."

I still experience drops in mental functioning and issues with sensory filters, as well as general anxiety and strong depression and lack of energy. During the first weeks, I experienced slight nausea, headaches, and tingling in my arms and face, which was not that bad.

He agreed that Celexa is very similar (chemically speaking) to Lexapro, and agreed to the switch. Like others who have posted reviews of Celexa, I feel that I have a little less energy than usual, I tire more easily, and my appetite has decreased. These are mild side effects and I do not forsee them causing me to stop taking Celexa. I enjoy the fact that I've lost weight, as it definitely makes me feel good to have people comment on how thin I look! As far as my sex drive, there has been a decrease on my part, but my husband and I did not have sex very often before I started this drug, so it really hasn't been as issue. Overall, I feel much more at ease with life in general. I recommend this drug to others who are dealing with depression.

When it wasn't covered by my insurance, I switched to Celexa (citalopram). Worked well for me, but made me feel like a ""drone"" sometimes - almost too leveled out. Also completely lost sex drive. Decided that I wanted to stop meds in preparation for another pregnancy and also b/c I really don't want to be on them. I stopped cold turkey (after taking 40 mg) and it is STUPID! Do not do it!

Finally after adding Celexa 20mg to my Wellbutrin 450mg I am starting to feel like the person I was beofore I had my daughter.  I makes me not sleep so well, so I take it in the morning when I get up.  I don't have many complaints except for not being able to have an orgasm during sex.  Which is a big problem.

I have suffered with serious anxiety issues since my childhood. The last few years I've had financial problems and extended family problems.  After giving birth, I suffered from severe anxiety, horrific dreams, and even worse panic attacks than I did previously.  I had the opposite of ""baby blues,"" because I didn't want to put my baby down even to have a meal.  I lost 20 lbs. due to depression.  Celexa has really helped with evening out my feelings and moods.  The biggest problem is I don't sleep well at night.  I take it before bedtime.  Sex life is a little better, because I feel better about myself.  Hope this helps someone out there."

I will never take myself off the medication again, and it is hard for me to admit that I may have to be on celexa for the rest of my life.

My doctor didn't believe it, but I'd read a lot online, and it was absolutely true.  I slowly weened myself off the medication for several months, and still, I got the odd jolting sensations, and otherwise felt very strange for a good several months.  Honestly, I don't think I felt completely normal for a good six months.  I think the drug helped me, but coming off of it was not fun. And honesty, anyone who thinks they're going to stop using it cold turkey is nuts.  Just do what people tell you, slowly ease off of it over a period of months, not weeks, and it will be weird, but eventually you'll be fine.

I have been on this tiny pill for a few years and I am so much better if I take it properly. Who cares if you gain 10 lbs? It is all about GETTING BETTER and that's the only reason to take and CONTINUE taking this medicine. If gaining a few pounds is the main thing you're worried about, you really have no major problems to medicate. I was clinically diagnosed with depression about 7 full years ago and I see a much better difference in my life while on this medication. I do not drink or even take Tylenol for minor pain; I was very scared about being on a ""pill."" If you are depressed, seriously depressed, don't hesitate on getting all the help you can get NOW. If you're reading this, that means you believe that something out there can help. Guess what? There is. "

I am on the generic version citalapram. I first was taking the generic version of Zoloft for about 4 months until I ended in the Psychriatric hospital for attmepting suicide. My doctor switched the medication to citalapram at that time and I have experienced the worst side effects, extreme hot flashes through out the day and night, nauseated during the night (severe feeling of vomiting), loss of appetite, food cravings for fast food, lost of interest in exercising ( I use to exercise 5 days per week), difficulty waking up in the morning for work, insomnia (unable to sleep), vivid dreams, nightmares, talking in my sleep (never use to do this before), anxious while at work, lost of interest in my career, depression has increased, and weight gain. Time to change medication and doctor because this is ridiculous. I rather just continue Therapy than take medication. About 4 years ago I had depression really bad and I never had to take medication, only Therapy, Therapy helped me a whole lot. My believes is medications is so overated, Therapy is the answer for me.  I am not happy with my current life on this medication. Good luck to all of you who swear by this medication, as for me I will be taking the Cognitive Behavioral approach to recovery for my depression,anxiety, and panic disorder.
1834$Condition: Depression$10/21/2008 4:18:20 PM$Reviewer: Suy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$5$"I've had (undiagnosed) chronic depression as an ongoing background for years. Then last year I landed in a terrible work environment and chose to leave it, in a way that ended rather traumatically. I went to consulting and the shrink freaked out saying I am so depressed I must go on meds now. I was hardly sleeping every night. 

I went to my M.D. who was also enthusiastic about the treatment. ""You will still be yourself"", he said. He chose Celexa and put me on a very low dose (10 mg).

Well, I bought a month's worth and took it... for six days. Yes, the pain and self-immolation inside my mind were numbed. BUT The last thing I can say is that I was myself. I was definitely NOT.

Where to begin?
- I am a morning person, off and running as soon as the alarm goes and sometimes a bit before that on most days; suddenly I would roll around in bed unable to switch my mind on for an hour.
- My sexual appetite is quite healthy and wide-ranging. Overnight it was simply gone. I had never felt anything like it.
- Perhaps worst of all: I am a researcher. I use my brain for a living. I write research articles. But suddenly, by brain became a fuzzball. I could not think for one minute straight. Not because I had other stuff on my mind; because it became a fuzzball.

This thing seems to work for other people, maybe they are less sensitive to drugs in general. I know I am, and with all the pain, anger and depression I prefer to be myself than the numb slob I became when on this thing.

The good thing about stopping after such a short while is that the ""chill-off"" period was much shorter. Yet, 3 days after getting off Celexa I had a day of worse depression than I had ever felt. But that was it.

Since then I exercise on a daily basis, put a lot of effort into my research, and try to move my life back on track. It will never be easy - but believing that ""you can take a pill and it will be better"" is in my view no different than becoming a drug addict."

1856$Condition: Other$10/4/2008 5:30:28 PM$Reviewer: mesuba, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$2$5$I have GAD and mild depression.  I took Celexa for over a year.  It was very helpful for treating both diseases.  My main issue with the drug were the side effects: restless leg syndrome, insomnia for hours after taking drug and hypersomnia around 8 hours after taking it.  I also noticed that it made me very fidgety, my feet would always be twitching and I could never just sit still.  The fidgeting did not bother me, I'd often not notice it because the movement itself made me feel good (lessened the anxiousness).  The RLS was horrific, I could not sleep at night!  I tried taking it in the morning, but by 6pm I couldn't possibly keep myself awake, so I tried taking it before bed, but even if I was extremely fatigued, taking the med would make me become wide awake and I'd lay in bed for hours trying to fall asleep.  Someone mentioned taking it at lunch which I never tried, but might have been the solution.  Also, if I'd skip more than 2 doses, I would become so depressed to the point of feeling suicidal, which IS NOT ME!  I also gained close to 30lbs while on this med, sometimes gaining 5lbs in one week when my dose was increased.  I also had a lot of muscle fatigue and stiffness.  All in all, if you need it, it works well, I just couldn't take the SE anymore!

Went to my family dr. who put me on Celexa.  Have had prozac in past with no side effects. Questioned why Celexa,   was told this is better for anxiety. Was on Celexa for 12 days and everyday I became increasingly sicker. Told my doctor and was told these were side effects. Went to a different doc & therapist and both told me I had Serotonin syndrome.(can be fatal)  BE CAREFUL of this drug. My Symptoms were: Increased anxiety, hot flash that started at my lower abdomin and went up to my chin, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure(never had high blood pressure b/4), severe nausea, loss of appetite(couldn't even look at food.(lost 12 lbs in 2 weeks) muscle spasms, couldn't sleep and when tried to sleep the slightest noise made me jump out of my skin. Low grade fever 99.7, massive headache. By day 12 extreme dizziness and couldn't stand up due to weakness and balance loss. It took my body 8 days after stopping Celexa to return to almost normal. After this experience I will try to make it through anxiety without any meds. 
*Please Note I have learned a lesson from this experience if you have been diagnoised with anxiety or panic disorder I feel we are labeled by some of the  medical profession.  So any complaints or symptoms you experience might not be taken as serious as someone who has not been diagnoised with these disorders.    Please if you feel something isn't right with what's going on in your body listen to yourself and get a second opinion. "

I feel like a different person since I started taking this drug. I don't have panic attacks when I leave the house anymore, and my counting (OCD - I'm a numbers girl & used to count everything!) stopped within weeks of starting on this drug. 
   I've found that it's best to take it around noon, if you take it before bed you may not be able to sleep, and taken too early in the morning you may be sleepy all day. Noon works great for me! I sleep well at night, have energy in the morning and just don't feel run-down all day anymore.
   I have had some side effects, but I kinda love those too. I got Loss of Appetite and Dry Mouth, luckily enough. I have some serious weight to lose (about 90 pounds,) and now I have less of an appetite and drink about three times as much water as I used to. I lost 12 pounds the first month on this drug! So no complaints here.

The stress of it all was causing awful painc attacks.  I finally went to my Dr, and it was almost embarrassing.  At first I was sick to my stomach and couldn't really eat anything without wanting to vomit.  Dizzy, tired, all the time.  I decided to only take 1/2 a pill for a few weeks, then gradually to the whole pill.  Now I am adjusted.  I did stop taking it suddenly, thinking I was pregnant, but I do not recommend doing that!  I have been all emotional, and its like the side effects of coming off are worse than when I began to take it.  Its probably why I thought I was prego.  In all, I didn't think it would make a difference, but it has.  If you are unsure like I was, trust me, it helps.  Everyone around me can feel the difference as well.

I never knew I was truly depressed until in my late 20's my mother told me that she no longer enjoyed our conversations because I was always such a ""downer"".  My mother and I are very close and I decided right then and there to do something about it.  Zoloft and Prozac did nothing.  Effexor made me extremely sick to my stomach.  Was on Paxil for quite a while until I met my husband and wanted him to know that my lack of sex drive was not related to him. Wellbutrin put me in such a fog I walked around like a zombie, could not control my extremities and felt like my head was floating above my body.  Along came Lexapro and I was saved!!  Something finally worked well with my body chemistry(an my mother's as well) and didn't cause me strange side effects!!  Being that my insurance did not cover it, my doctor put me on Celexa (Lexapro's cousin) and I have never looked back.  I do not ""hide out"" or avoid social situations as much as I used to.  I laugh and love to make people laugh.  People that I confide in about taking an antidepresant can not believe that I actually NEED this.  That is how much this has helped me.  Lastly, the only side effect I get is if I forget to take it for a few days I will cry at the drop of a hat.  I will feel like crying over ANYTHING when I skip a dose/doses.  It is then I know I am off my routine... but no other side effects.  Hope this helps someone else."

The only time I've ever had a problem was when I have missed doses or stopped taking it all-together. One or two missed doses doesn't affect me but any more than that and I notice a big difference in my mood. While on this medication my anger, weepiness, and aggression are all relieved. I recommend it to anyone experiencing these feelings, however, if you also suffer from depression it shouldn't be your only method of treatment. Also, as with any medication, you should take it exactly as prescribed and try not to miss a dose or just stop taking it without consulting your physician.

I didn't take it for a few days when I ran out of pills while on vacation...very bad thing.  I felt like I was going absolutely crazy.  But right away when I started up again everything was back to normal, even the first day I took it.

Personally I would not recommend it to anyone, but I do know that I had pretty uncommon side effects.

It has worked very well for me.  Sometimes I still have some OCD symptoms, but overall I am very much improved.  I did have a decline in my ability to orgasm, but Wellbutrin has taken care of this issue.  My worst complaint is that I have VERY vivid dreams that sometimes leave me tired and make me feel as if I haven't slept.  My second complaint is that I have an increased startle reflex- which can be rather aggitating.  I take this (40 mg) with Wellbutrin (300 mg) and Trazadone (150 mg) and the combination has really changed my life.  I can leave the house, I don't count, I can touch things, I can also drink the water.  I am not drugged up or feel disconnected- I have previously had bad luck with Prozac and Paxil.  I hope this is helpful!

Instantly, major weight gain occurred and would not come off.  Tired all the time; over time had to increase dosage and then decrease when I got too anxious.  If forgot to take it for a day, sickness (stomach upset, nervousness) would occur.  When I finally decided I did not need it anymore (with my doctor's knowledge); I gradually decreased the dosage.  BE AWARE: There is no going ""cold turkey"" with this medicine; you will become very physically sick if you do.  I gradually cut back 5-10 mg about every three-five months as I could; then at the lowest dose, went every other day until the medication was finished.  The highest I was at was 60 mg.  It took about 2 years to get off the medication.  It was very tough; there was stomach upset; worry; diarhea; cold sweats; felt like my head was ""foggy"".  But it can be done.  If you feel you need to get off this medicine; talk to your doctor and give yourself A LOT of time (gradually; at least a year).  I really think your body and mind become dependent on it.  If I could do it, anyone can.  Best of Luck; be blessed."

After a while the effectiveness of the medication wore off, and even the higher dose wouldn't effect me. Because of my age, the doctors said it was likely because of hormonal changes. Overall, I do feel it somewhat worked, but i wouldnt reccomend it for children with depression.

It did a good job tamping down on panic attacks.  I still had them, but they occured less often, and when they did they were way shorter and way less severe. They also seemed to decrease in frequency over time. The only side effect I noticed a lot was trouble orgasming (which I never had issues with before!)  I ended up going off it for that reason only.  I am now trying Wellbutrin, which solved the sexual side effect.  We'll see how the Panic attacks go on this one.

New doc doesn't like using Lorazepam as a maintenance drug and wanted to stop using it and increase Celexa. I began having side effects from Celexa @ 40mg dose (increase from 20mg Celexa and 2 mg Lorazepam daily). For me, Celexa @ 40 mg created too many side effects that were uncomfortable (migraines, blurred vision, muscle tremors, etc). Celexa @ 20-30 mg works well for me in conjunction wtih Lorazapam.

I take it at night, it helps me sleep (before it would be close to an hour before my mind would shut up for me to fall asleep).  I use to snap at my husband and family, not meaning too, but the celexa rid me of that.  Only side effect is that is slows me down, which sucks since I'm already always tired.  Got off of it once on my own and it caused headaches, realized how much it was helping me so I got back on.  It works for me!!  p.s. my mom takes it too and she did a total 360 for the good!!

Now I am able to get my life back together. NO side effect. Only the first 2 weeks while the medicine was adjusting in my system my libido was low...now I crave sex like never before, and sex is amazing! Feels better than before.
Maybe the fact that I am more active, taking long walks, eating healthy, has helped me skip all those side effects that everyone talks about.
If you start on this medication I recommend to ALL to adjust your lifestyle as well. Go outside! Enjoy the sun! Exercise..Help yourself, don't expect the medicine to do it all for you. You need to put something for yourself too!

1994$Condition: Depression$4/6/2008 12:25:53 PM$Reviewer: Rose, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I started taking Celexa in the AM because it has a tendency to keep me up at night. I have taken it for about 5 years after trying Paxil and Zoloft both of which had horrible side effects (paxil left me with dry heaves) and zoloft left me too spacey. I would recommend backing off on caffeine if you are taking Celexa in the AM because it gives you a boost and you may feel spacey if you have caffeine along with it. As with any drug, side effects seems worse at first but all of mine on Celexa went away after consistently taking it. I was nauseated at first but after my body got used to the AM routine it went away. Consistency with taking Celexa at the same time every day is what will help you notice a big differece. Like I said, PM doses keep me awake still, but it had no effect on weight, skin, sex drive, or ability to process thought (its actually helped me in all of those areas!)

But I found myself not being able to get out of bed to go to work or do anything. I started taking citalopram and after a week I felt a little better but not ALOT better. My dr increased my dosage twice. I feel much better. I don't cry at the drop of a hat for no particular reason anymore. My thoughts seem more clear and not jumbled. My stressors are still there but this medication has helped me to handle them differently and not snap at people. That is the biggest difference that I've noticed.

Began abusing alcohol to cover up anxiety/depression. Lost control of emotions with love of my life. Started on 20mg. It has only been a week but can feel a powerful difference. No more alcohol cravings-Trust me-Do Not Drink while on this stuff. It's crazy. Cures anxiety. Depression lifts but ambition decreases. Strange sexual side affects. Definite decrease in sex drive, but get sudden unexpected sexual urges. Gives you peace, but you quit caring about people quite as much. I became introspective and clear headed. I think other people are hilarious now. They seem like a joke to me. Before I felt the joke was on me. Never believed in medication, but you can feel this stuff reorganize your brain.Does not alleviate heartbreak though. Wish I started it sooner.

After reading some of the comments posted, I am comforted by the fact that my physican started me off slow and is not over medicating me. It seems that some people are thrown on 40mg and no one is really monitoring their condition. Depression is not suppose to last for years and it seems that some people need to deal with the life issues  that continue to contribute to their depression. To those who have been depressed for a long time, it might be time to get a second opinion or an alternative diagnois. God Bless and good health.

I have gained weight (5 lbs), and my libido went way down after about 5 weeks of use. Currently on 10mg buspar to combat sexual side effects, which may help a little (hard to say). If I skip two doses I notice that I am more irritable, needy, and mood-swingy.  
2084$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/2/2008 5:35:45 PM$Reviewer: Ana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$4$I have not been on the medication long enough to say for sure whether or not it has completely worked for me yet.  But adjusting to it has been extremely difficult. I am also on 60mg of Buspar. I have been taking it for 1 1/2 years, it worked well until recently. For the first few weeks on 10mg  I had a major increase in anxiety and anxiety attacks, had tremors, was very shakey, could not relax, trouble sleeping, and a decrease in sexual desire (well who wouldn't when you feel like this).  I was completely miserable and having to work full-time.  It took about 5 1/2 weeks before I felt okay. Without the help of Xanax to calm me down I would never have made it through it. I would have to take .25mg of Xanax with the Celexa every morning and on really bad days a few times throughout the day.  I highly recommend having Xanax or another drug similar on hand incase you have intense side effects. I have been told that I am more sensitive to it than others.

Not as greatly as before, but I feel that the things that were slowing me down and making me feel so empty and sad inside are getting better. It has helped me so much and I am greatful that my doctor had agreed to change the medication I was on and take my panic attacks and depression more seriously then she had before.

It was not effective for that. I was also on Dexedrine for ADHd and immediately began having issues with that drug, which I had  responded ver well to and had almost immediately made vast improvements in my life. I CAN NOT IMAGINE  HOW  MUCH WORSE i WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT IT AT THAT TIME. 
Almost immediately after starting Celexa, I began  having touble sleeeping, it was wrecking havoc on the dexedrine impact, making it not only innefective at the prescribed dose but causing me to have to use more than usuala s my symptoms worsened and I would be awake for days.
It was helpful whenI was in a depressive state, however I was also experiencing manic episodes before I started it, but had increased symptoms after taking it.
The depresion was so bad however that I did kept taking it.
The most frustrating apart was that  doctors all blamed the dexedrine, which actually  helped to manage the adverse side effects of the celexa. They all began to thinkI was addicted to the dexedrine because of the contraindaction with celexa (iformation that I found  on the webafter two years of this).
Overall- it was a horrible experience and did nothing to help  the panic which was the  biggest issue. It was however useful for the depression, unfortunately with  major adverse side effects."

My side effects were minimal and included some fatigue, a minor hand tremor, dizziness, and loss of appetite.

It had gotten very bad with crying nonstop and even thinking about how to commit suicide.  I knew I needed help.  The celexa has been very helpful with the suicidal thoughts and the depression, the only things that bother me is I find it very hard to cry and like one of the other reviews I read, I feel numb.  I've only gained 2 pounds and this I believe is from the holiday eating as I've been on the med since September 2007 and just gained the weight in December. Sometimes I feel disconnected from things in life, but then I wonder if feeling normal finally instead of always crying and feeling suicidal and depressed is just taking some getting used to.  I really never had calmness like I do now on the celexa.  I've been on paxil and gained 50 pounds, on wellbutrin and lost weight but never on anything that has helped me this much. I hope I don't have to take this for the rest of my life, but if I do it's better than the life I was living.

I always felt like I should be able to control how I feel. I never felt suicidal, just blah and negative, so I admitted I could feel better and gave in to taking the medication and went to 3 counseling sessions, mainly to accept my depression. It has been a very positive experience for me and the medication has been working. I take 40mg 1x/day and I feel more positive about my life and my interactions with people. I had mild side effects for the first month, dry mouth, yawning, decreased sexual desire, but they went away. I now believe depression is an inbalance of chemicals in the brain because after taking Celexa, my thinking changed. I tried to change it on my own to be more positive, but it always felt like something was blocking me. I have now realized and accepted I have mild depression, and that is what was blocking me and I don't have the power to control it, and it's ok to get help with it.
