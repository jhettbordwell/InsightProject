I think for a lot of people the reason it works is that it inflicts pain and when you're focused on the pain you can't argue or defend yourself.  The thing is, this medicine did nothing to remove or reduce hallucinations or delusions, I was having them when i had them regardless of dose (I've taken anywhere from 1-6mg/day), I was just busy focusing on the pain so didn't complain as much about the other symptoms.

I was also prescribed Paxil and Klonopin too, for anxiety. My disorganized, paranoid thoughts pretty much disappeared! OCD was way better too. Then, after about 3.5 years of treatment with Risperdal, I developed a severe bladder problem, in which I had no control over my bladder. I wet the bed every single night. It really was a huge disruption in my life. This is when my Medicaid plan went to a generic(However, I'm not so sure the generic was the problem). One thing was, on the name brand, I did extremely well! As soon as I went to the generic, my bladder, and my mental state sunk again! I do not know if this has anything to do with the brand vs. generic though. However, I recently stopped taking Risperidone, and I am not at all wetting the bed anymore! Itching ceased as well. Also, Risperidone made my feel the inner restlessness(Akathesia) where I would go nuts upon taking it. Good effectiveness, horrible, nasty, side effects!!! Nearly impossible to take for me, anyway. Try to, maybe even ask for an older antipsychotic, Typical type. This stuff worked well and then turned me into a bed wetting maniac, all hopped up, all day long!

Maybe a bit weird, but then I started lactating and I decided to try something else. Sad actually-- because the psychotic symptoms went away at a relatively low dose.

When she could not get him out of her home she began showing severe anger about it and she and my sister were fighting about it everyday. My sister took her to a doctor that specialized in dementia but instead of telling the truth why my mother's anger and behavior was so out of control, this doctor, who had never seen or treated my mother before,prescribed this medication. This medicine completely changed my mother from an active person to a bedridden person that had to be taken care of like a baby. She refused or wasn't able to function as a normal person. When another sister and I got involved and learned of the medicine she was being given we told my sister to stop giving it to her, which she did and my mother returned to her old self but with the same problems, the anger over my nephew living in her home, so the arguments started again and my sister, to keep my mother in a vegatated state put her back on it and that was the beginning of the end of my mother's life. My sister and I tried getting guardianship over my mother but with all the red tape and lack of money to fight it in court we had to give it up. So after a time it took its toll and only months after giving up the fight for guardianship my mother passed away and I know this medication and my sister is what caused her death!!!

He started on .5 mg twice a day and within 3 weeks it had kicked in. He was very sedated and his appetite had increased within the first few weeks, but 7 mths on what a different person.! He hasnt once been anxious, there have been no incidents with him, what a turnaround.? However, after the 7 mths of being on this medication he has taken a dip where many of his traits have returned, he is displaying the things he used to do before taking respiridone and the anxiety is back, i actually thought he had become resistant to it as he was being violent again. The doctor said this can happen whilst on this medication so it has been increased to 4mg a day its only been a week since hes been on the increased dose and the sedation has returned with lack of interest with activities, he sometimes looks a little vacant and delays in doing things or answering you, i do believe in repiridone though as it worked for my son for 7 mths.

I would not recommend this drug to anyone. The therapist who prescribed it to me, Dr. Katherine Watkins from Rand, would not even give me a diagnosis. She said that I had to keep taking this but would not give me a reason. I asked her several times regarding the side effects and she would not disclose them to me. If I didn't know better, I'd think that some doctors just prescribe it to see what will happen to their patients. It must be some sick form of ""research"" because they obviously don't care that the benefits of prescribing this seem to HARDLY EVER outweigh the side effects. "

My wife and daughter had noticed a scary change in my personality once I left the intensive care/ hospital stay and was at the rehab center. Upon checking she found out the attending doctor was prescribing Risperdal and decided to research it on the web. She was shocked and scared to find her results and immediately went to see the doctor telling him she wanted her husband off of this medication. The doctor refused until she said I was a member of AA and had a strong background in abuse of chemicals ( alcohol) 20 years before. He told her he took me off of it but she found the papers recently stating he never had during my two week stay. I believe this horrible drug caused psychosis in me while I was there and also was the culprit for my loss of taste and smell. I do remember being able to taste food when I first got to the hospital but never again after that. It is in my opinion the wrong drug to give to a patient with a serious head injury as they are already fighting to deal with brain issues. This was 13 years ago and I have never recovered my sense of smell or taste.

After trials of Seroquel,Trazadone and Depacote there was no improvement.  She now is on a low dose of Risperdal at the nursing home with no change. She has been physically healthy and on eyedrops only. I feel since it is not recommended for elderly dementia and has life threatening side effects, that she should not be given this medication.  She was walking before this medication but now is unable to without falling.  Her aggression is only during these times and I feel that it is because she is confused and afraid.  It ceases when the intervention is complete.  There is no psychiatrist ordering this medication or appropriate blood work monitoring.  Even though I am her daughter and legal guardian the nursing home will not get it discontinued by her family physician. I worry that continuing it will hasten her death.

con: i gained weight, lactated, laziness, i did not really have a motive for anything. the worst thing about this drug though, was the fact that i felt like i had no feeling, coming from before being anxious and having too many thoughts and fears to having any makes you seem lifeless, it was good for overcoming my extremely bad anxiety, but once i got off the medication i got anxiety, it has however gone down."

All I desired was to see my ex stable for once in her life and I allowed myself to be talked into seeking help for myself, (hoping to set an example), when it was her who desperately needed it. The psychiatrist believed the stories fabricated by my ex and treated me with Risperdal. This drug is dangerous when it is not needed. I hallucinated, drooled, had high and low mood swings, heart palpitations, etc. and it made me feel so high, then low, that I literally wanted to kill myself. At times I felt so high, I felt invincible. I had the sense to realize that something was dangerously wrong here. Having the sense to stop the medication shortly after starting it, (within a couple of months), because of the dangerous side effects I was feeling, what was most unbelievable even to this day, was the idea that another human being, (the psychiatrist), could use someone like a guinea pig and drug them into oblivion while under their care. Thank God I am 6 years out of this predicament but the emotional triggers that were inserted into me while in the hospital are as real as if they happened yesterday. Every day is a struggle to maintain my perspective and realization that when medical mistakes are made and not acknowledged, people can die. Had I did decide to take my life while drugged, the psychiatrist would have been validated and I would have been considered the nut. Psychiatry is a dangerous business. I have not only reported this to MedWatch but also to my local, State of CT Practicioner's Licensing and Investigations Board, The Attorney General, as well as other authorities, all to no avail. I do not wish what happened to me on anyone. All the systems do is protect each other at all costs. This is immoral.
36$Condition: Other$3/29/2012 2:36:16 AM$Reviewer: Lisa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$After suffering from depression since childhood and taking nearly all brands of antidepressants, which were not effective, I was diagnosed with chronic major depression. Initially the psychiatrist put me on Olanzapine, which helped with the depression, but the major side effects of this drug were weight gain of 60 lbs. in six months and sleeping 14-16 hours per day.  Now that I am on .5mg of Risperdal my life has changed.  My mood has improved immensely, though my anxiety has increased slightly. I have lost 20 lbs. in 4 months.  However, my hypersomnia has turned into insomnia, but at least I am able to get things done.  Other adverse effects are confusion, inability to concentrate and bladder problems.  As I was able to retire early, some of these side effects will not destroy my life as the depression did, though I would not recommend this drug to someone with depression who is under 50 or over 70 unless many other alternatives have been tested.  Everyone reacts differently to medication, but my recommendation would be to start at the very minimum dosage and slowly work your way up if need be to avoid serious side effects as much as possible. My major concern with this drug are the long-term side effects.

Never mind the fact that anyone in my situation would have been irritable, not least of all because my father had just died, I could not get any emotional support, and I had been repressing all anger and irritation for five years previously.  Instead of teaching me to be more assertive, let's just make the emotions go away, right??

Well anyway.  On 1-2 mg, I slept constantly, had such pain in my hips, shoulders, and pectoral muscles that I could not walk or lift my kids, and could not think clearly enough to do simple household chores without someone to remind me of each step.  

I had all the negative emotions-- in fact my depression worsened until I became suicidal-- but my therapists thought everything was great because I appeared calm due to having no ability to think clearly enough to express what I was feeling.  

All in all a horrible drug.  Unless someone is very violent, I would not even consider Risperdal for treatment.  "

The doctors did not take time to review my symptoms when I was admitted, so I was put on the drug almost immediately after admittance.
As it turned out, I had severe OCD and moderate mood issues, NOT schizophrenia as they had thought.
After being put on another medication, the Risperdal was STILL not working.
2 years later, I started going to a different psychiatrist, and he FINALLY got me off the drug.
The problem was now, not my condition, but my weight. I had always been underweight, but during the 2005-2006 school year, I nearly doubled my weight, going from 65lbs to 120.
I was bullied because of my weight, and eventually it got so bad that I was homeschooled from late 2006-mid 2009.
5 years later, I am a freshman (back in the public school system) and still have not recovered from the side affects of Risperdal,I am now almost 140 lbs.

I have always had times where I have, you could say, went crazy.  I have had extreme highs and extreme lows.  In a rage I stuck a steak knife in my chest twice.  Then was hospitalized.  There they put me on this medication.  At first I thought it was helping wonderfully.  After about 6 months I began to hate myself on it.  I never had any emotion.  No happiness, no sadness, and no anger.  All are vital to being a human being, as long as none are extreme.  I decided to quit cold turkey.  Did not take long till I was losing my mind, literally.  At the time I had no idea why, I just thought I must really be crazy and need this medicine.  Then I would take it again.  Then of course quit.  I spent another 6 months trying to live a normal life.  I don't remember most of this time.  It is time I will never get back.  I just know that if ever I really wanted to die it was this time.  My brain was screaming at me daily, hourly, minutely, and every second.  No one including doctors understood what was wrong with me.  It was a nitemare.  To put anyone through any of this is horrible.  To be on it was horrible.  The dreams, the no emotion, the not wanting to live.  Still every show that I watched when I was on this, when they come on I get the most horrific feeling when they come on.  The side effects to using this will never, I do believe, completely go away.  I would rather be dead than be on this.  That is coming from the heart.  Please make sure you or your loved one is in dyer need of this before taking.  It will ruin yours and those around you's life.

In that time she went from a size 5 to a size 10 in clothing. She weighed 43 lbs before starting and currently is 56lbs. I keep her eating under control and always feed her healthy food. She cries because she is always hungry. I had to buy her size 10 pants and hem the legs 6 inches just so she can wear jeans. I am doing all I can to stop her from scratching her skin because she is getting stretch-marks. I cannot even lift her anymore she is so heavy. The bad part is, she is still gaining weight. She also has had an increase in Absence seizures as well. She is taking Lamictal for seizures, but it isn't working. The only reason she takes risperdal it is because the school cannot stand my child's manic behavior. My advise is to think what is more important, satisfying lazy teachers or putting your child through physical horror. I feel terrible about her being on this med. I wish there was a safer alternative for small children.

I am spiritually inclined, and my doctor was an Atheist. He made it very 'clear' to me that angels and god were fabrications, and false clutches, and there is no proof that my beliefs could be real. He also stated that imagination and faith are not healthy 'choices' in this world. I was suicidal at the time due to non-faith based problems, but pressures and events at that time of my life that built up to severe depression. But, he used his prejudice to diagnose me and ignored the real reasons I was in danger. I needed help for the events that happened to me, not medication for *one* sentence I uttered about prayer.  It sounds like a made-up story, I assure you it was not. This is an issue I have with the sector of psychology that assumes God is a mental illness. I am a colorful creative person, and he used his gray-stoicism to counter my beliefs, rather than help me. If you are indeed, schizophrenic or have dementia, this pill will work, since my great aunt took it for her dementia, and it helped. But if you are diagnosed WRONGLY this will make you even more depressed, despondent, zombie like, and coupled with prozac, I gained 55 lbs. I had a trainer and was on a diet, and still didn't lose the weight, which made me MORE depressed. It wasn't until I went to a new doctor 2 1/2 years later, that I was avenged. She saved me, told me I was GROSSLY misdiagnosed, and dangerously over-medicated. 
(he had me at full dose Prozac and 90% full dose Resp.) Nightmare. 

PLEASE PEOPLE. GET SECOND OPNIONS. It could save your life!! You are never 'married' to any doctor, regardless if they make you feel like they're the only one you should see. LEAVE THEM if you are doing everything correctly, and still are getting no results months later. "

At the time, it did help with disruptive behavior but mostly because it caused fatigue. My son gained almost 40 pounds, had breasts beginning to develop, and abnormal liver function tests. Whenever he was 16, last year, he suddenly developed abnormal liver enzymes which couldn't be attributed to anything else- every test short of biopsy was performed. And suddenly he started to gain weight- so much that he now has severe stretch marks. All of this happened 8 years after stopping the risperdal and returning to his pre-risperdal weight. I am very concerned about what even psychiatrists such as my son's previous pediatric psychiatrist are giving to kids. He is functioning much better on nothing but behavior modifications. He just graduated at 17 and made a 25 on the ACT. I'm just not sure of the long=term effects on children and I don't think anyone in the medical community truly is either.

Thank God for the Risperdal. He rarely even gets angry anymore, and I'm no longer afraid to confront him if he's behaved negatively. However, the weight gain has been enormous. He's grown a lot height wise, but the weight gain isn't in proportion. He's an athlete, lifts weights 5 days a week and works out with his track team every day. The problem is he's now 300 pounds, at 6'5"", and he gained so much weight so fast he even has stretch marks on his waist, hips, under his arms, his shoulders, etc. His size is great for football, to a certain degree but not so much for basketball, as the extra weight really slows him down. He eats healthy, but enormous amounts of food. If not for the weight gain, this would be the perfect medication for him. Kids have started teasing him, even though he's a popular athlete at his high school. His success in school can only be attributed to being on Risperdal. We've had to gauge what's more important here, and since he was basically headed for a life of crime and juvenile detention centers followed most likely by life in adult prisons, we'll take the weight gain.

He doesn't get angry too much any more and he can actually think about his actions first.

Now, my doctor is taking me off it as my prolactin went up to 3 times the max limit.  The increased prolactin levels recently gave me E.D. which is why they did the blood work and found out about the increased prolactin levels.  I did like Risperdal as it really helped my calm my mood and helped with some anger issues I was dealing with.  I had been taking Risperdal to counteract symtoms from longtime use of Ritalin when I was a kid. Overall I was pretty satisfied and am sad to be comming off, but my doctor this\nks we might be ok on just the effexor and if not I'm to tell him right away and we'll try something else then.

He has been less angry and less violent.  He is very emotional though.  Instead of raging out, he cries more.  He definately has an increased appetite.  Overall, I would say that this is a very effective medication for him.

(along w/serzone) for treatment of seizures, depression & psychotic episodes. While the weight gain IS an issue-this has helped control his seizures & psychotic episodes which have been attributed to possible schizophrenia.   I can always tell when he's missed a dose because he will have a seizure or a hallucination or his speech becomes slurred & you can't understand his speech.

Although this is now used in a complete regime of other medications and therapy, I am pleased with how it works for him. It helps him to control his anger outbursts and helps to keep his emotions ""even"" through out the day. The ONLY bad thing we have experienced is weight gain, he has gained 20 lbs in one year. However, he is not considered obese or overweight, it is an issue for parents to keep an eye on."
