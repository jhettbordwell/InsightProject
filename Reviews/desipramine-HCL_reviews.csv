I experienced such severe constipation I developed a painful UTI, complete with burning pain and pelvic cramps. My doctor suggested lowering my dosage, but it did nothing.

2$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$8/4/2017 7:46:14 PM$Reviewer: Rebecca Fesperman, 19-24 Female  (Patient) $2$1$1$I despise this drug. I was taking 100 mg and experienced such severe constipation I developed a UTI and pelvic pain. Ended up making my neuropathic pain even worse. I tried to lower dosage and it did nothing, still the same awful constipation and depressed feelings. If you are prone to experiencing side effects from drugs, DO NOT take this medication. 
3$Condition: Depression$5/18/2017 6:20:41 PM$Reviewer: Lucky Larry, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$4$I have been taking desipramine (the generic from Actavis) for depression since 2003, returning to it after trying other meds.  It is the only one that helped, although high doses caused shortness of breath, low-back pain, nightmares, stress, and anxiety.  The key has been finding the correct dose.  An important discovery was that chocolate produces a synergistic effect.  Taking it in the evening right after a large serving of dark chocolate and 10 ounces of milk allows me to keep the dose and prescription costs low.  It is not nearly as effective without chocolate during the day.  But a problem is that it is addictive.  Increasing the dose made me more depressed but going down improved my mood, so finding the optimal one has been difficult. 
4$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$2/3/2017 2:35:34 PM$Reviewer: Willis, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$3$I've been taking Desipramine for years, on and off, for Trigeminal Neuralgia.  It works very well for my pain but causes me to be severely depressed, the more I increase the dose. I was originally prescribed this as a sub for nortrityline b/c it has less side effects. However, I had no energy at all, increased appetite (namely made me crave sweets), makes me cry a lot, & and causes weight gain.  Eventually led to irritability, too.  It's negatively effecting those around me as much as it is me.  I have to find another med that helps my nerve pain as well as this does b/c the depression is just unbearable.

I was blind and couldn't speak for over 8 hours, along with other miserable side effects. It caused a seemingly permanent change in blood pressure, vision, and gave me chronic headaches (all day every day for 5 months now). I've been on this med for two months for the headaches. started with 10mg, now I am at 50mg. I've lost 6 pounds in a couple weeks since last upping the dose. I get 1-3.5 hours of sleep a night. Out of the 10 meds I've tried this is the only one that has helped my headaches. I can now stay out of bed for the most part. It took my headaches to a constant dull level, I still have severe moments of pain, they don't seem to last as long. while this med helps some, my headaches effect me enough still that I have trouble keeping up in school, I have to take 15 hours next semester to graduate with my class for my bachelors degree. I don't think it's possible with the way I feel and how tired I get. :(
7$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/3/2015 8:47:13 AM$Reviewer: temporal lobe adhd, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"All the other ADHD meds haven't worked and neither does this one. The Integrated Visual Auditory continuous performance test rated my ADHD so severe that I tested several decimal places below the 1 percentile. And I've tried all the on and off label drugs. Amphetamine Salts works the best and that is still not worth the dry mouth unless I'm behind on sleep.

I've been on Desipramine for 5 weeks now starting at 75 and now up to 225. It gives me in order of severity: severe dry mouth (like all the others), somnolence(strong desire for sleep), sinus congestion, lowers my energy and motivation, and gave me a near death experience when I took desipramine 150, amphetamine salts IR 30 and propranolol IR 80 all at the same time without much breakfast or drink. Instead of helping get things done, it's making it even harder to get things done. All 3 use the same 2D6 enzyme and amphetamine and desipramine enhance each other which gave me several of desipramine's side effects. Caffeine works better than amphetamine for not interacting with desipramine, but still increases the dry mouth terribly. Looks like a cholinergic deficit but Galantamine didn't do anything. Pilocarpine relieves my dry mouth but doesn't solve the core attention problem."

13$Condition: Depression$9/23/2013 3:39:45 PM$Reviewer: Bobby64, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$5$My psychiatrist gave this to me for my depression.  I still felt lethargic and unmotivated while taking it.  Although it made me feel “non-depressed,” I didn’t feel happy, either.  I still had trouble enjoying many of my usual activities, save for in a few short bursts.  Going on too high of a dose made me feel drugged, anxious, grouchy, and... well, depressed.  Although I played around with the time of day I took the lower dose, I still felt more like a tired zombie than a happy person, even if I didn’t have any emotional breakdowns.  Also, my weight went up sixteen pounds in the three months I took it.  Plus, it seemed to mess with my ability to form new memories.  Although it helped a little, it certainly wasn’t the medicine that would save me.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

I started on 25 mg and couldn't tolerate the side effects for 3 days. I had heart flutters (not the usual palpitations), headache, and my cognitive abilities were slowed. I felt drugged. Now, almost 60 hours later, I still feel weak and anxious.  I took Desipramine many years ago for a couple of years. I take Sumatriptan for my migraines. I am hypothyroid. Other than that, I'm perfectly healthy and in good physical shape. I work and I am active in my community. I am shocked that I am so sensitive to such a small dose of Desipramine, but perhaps there's more to this than I know. This drug has not helped me at all and I cannot wait for it to leave my system completely.

I couldn't wake up completely, felt like my brain was still sleeping when I did, and I could fall asleep at the drop of a hat.  Barely functioning.  This med. saved my life and allowed me to function again.  Started with 10 mg and now take 50 mg. My biggest problem is I feel like I can't live without it and because it is so old, manufactures have stopped making it so the price continues to go up and I have no insurance.

I SAVED MY LIFE and I was able to fuction in life again as long as I have rubber bottom shoes on at all times. I used this drug for over 20 years and then I started developing sharp pains in my head is I even missed one dose so we swicked to Cymbalta and that is doing better for me now.

I'm now 58 years old and take 150mg per day. Growing up I was depressed all the time and regular drugs doctors prescribed left me doped up and sluggish all the time. To be successful with this drug, you can't stop it when you start feeling better but continue the plan your doctor places you on. By the way, regular MDs did not know about this drug so it is very important to see a psychiatrist and visit him/her once a year for maintenance.

At first it seemed to help then BAM almost all the negitave side effects this med has hit me like a train wreck. So I decided to stop...with out tappering down cause I was unable to get a hold of my Dr and the side effects were making things worse for my personal life. 3 days go by I think I am fine and suddenly just feel ill as all hell and throw up. Next day (today) I woke up around noon after my gf told me she was going to work around 11:30. Got to my computer and just felt ill like if I had the flu or something but I knew it was from the Desipramine so after not being able to take it I took 50mg and with in an hour or so I am now feeling better. I am going to stay at 50mg and try to get a hold of my Dr tomorrow and see if I can taper from 50mg to nothing or if I would need to go from 50mg to 25mg to nothing over a week or so. I can honestly say I hate this med with a passion. I would rather be depressed sometimes then have painful urination/ejaculation and urine retention and constantly feeling like a zombie all day. I stopped SSRI's cause they killed my sex drive, this crap just makes it painful and not in a good way. I would HONESTLY USE THIS AS LAST RESORT. That's just my thoughts.

My body does not work well any of the meds I've been given, and despramine was no different.  I was given the drug because of pain, numbness, and discomfort to anything that moves on my left side of my boday (foot, knee, elbow, shoulder)caused by the brain operation. The drug made me very faigued, with increased confusion in thoughts, moody, and I feel as though I'm carrying around a heavy weight on my back contantsly.  This was with only 10mg which was increased to 20mg with a end goal of 50mg or fix of the problem.  Perhaps I could handle it if I wasn't still working on complex problems in software development.  But I find it difficult to do much of anything, much less something that is complex in nature.  
This post is really for people that are in similar situations as myself, and NOT for depression which is what it seems this drug was intended for. I will be talking to my Dr about Nuerotin which may be a better choice for my ailment.  So if you need help for depression, disregard my low star ratings. Those trying to alleviate neurological issues may find Desipramine helpful.  My body just did not handle it well.  "

I've taken almost every SSRI there is (well, it seems that way) and they all have made my depression, anxiety/panic disorder, paranioa, etc, worse. My reactions ranged from hearing things, imagining strange(r) things, enragement, increased depression, increased suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, etc. My doctor, at the time, immediately said I was bi-polar because of this. Now just because SSRI's make my conditions worse, it CAN mean I have bi-polar but I never have been manic in my life. I was told I have bi-polar II. No sky-high high's but the lowest of the lows lasting from 2-6 weeks. Fast forward 2 years and now I've been on every anti-seizure med, mood stabilizer and bi-polar med from Depakote to Lithium to Abilify, Trazadone, Seroquel, etc. I finally switched doctors after years of no improvement. After a look at my file, my new Doc says he wants to try and older anti-depressant; one that works differently than the ones you see on TV these days. We started low just in case my usual reactions began. I'm now on 200mg daily and feeling great. I still feel apathetic and unmotivated to some extent but the depression is almost gone. Yes I still have my ""days"" but I'm able to go to work everyday. I think I used 400+ hours of sick time the year before last. But with a combination of this, valium and provigil, I seem to be in check. 
If you react backwards to current anti-depressants or if they worsen your conditions, give this stuff a try. It's stopped suicidal thoughts/ideations, self isolation, feelings of worthlessness, and basically the loss all pleasure in my life. Truly something to try if you're sick of going from med to med."

My hand were ICY cold -- which, as a nurse, my patients did not appreciate.  But what got me to quit it was that it caused vaginal bleeding -- my periods which had always been irregular started coming at shorter and shorter intervals until I was spotting all the time.   I asked the doctor if it could be due to the med, and he said no.  So, I had a biopsy of the uterine lining done -- painful and I had no insurance, so out of pocket expense.  Thankfully, it showed no malignancy.

It helps with the depression to some degree. Goal success dose was at least 100mg a day. I very slowly - half a 25mg increased it each week until reaching 75mg a day. But it dried my mouth out so bad, it was driving me crazy. Dr. suggested Biotene gum to increase saliva - and it did, but would only last for about 20 minutes and I had to chew it constantly, so it was like adding a new expensive med to my treatment plan & don't have insurance. Of course, the dryness also created a bad taste in my mouth, so I was also concerned about bad breath. Dr. said I wasn't close to effective dose, so I backed down to 25mg and he added mood stabilizer - Lamictal, which is another story. In my case, I seem to be especially prone to side effects of many medications at very low doses, so I think that is one reason Desipramine did not work well for me. Oh, and it was very constipating and I have gallbladder disease, which also has that affect - so couldn't tolerate both together. Don't have money for gallbladder surgery, so had two reasons for really cutting down on Desipramine. Have tried everything else on market for depression over 20 years, so the fact that 25mg helps to a degree is why I haven't changed.
