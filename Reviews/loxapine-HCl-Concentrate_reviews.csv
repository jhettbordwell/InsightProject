0$Condition: Schizophrenia$7/21/2015 11:33:46 PM$Reviewer: Bobbi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been on several different antipsychotics with many side effects, and Loxapine has been very effective in treating my hallucinations and delusions with minimal side effects. The other antipsychotics made me gain weight because I was always hungry which is not the case with Loxapine. I do get fast heartbeats at times, sweat when standing for prolonged periods, and have difficulty falling asleep, but I do take it at night. I sleep well once asleep. and I'm able to think clearly the next day/ I work and go to school and I wouldn't be able to on any of the other antipsychotics that make you drowsy all the time. I do wish I didn't have the blank look on my face all the time, but the benefits definitely outweigh the side effects. I am truly grateful for this drug. It has changed my quality of life.

2$Condition: Schizophrenia$9/12/2013 12:58:23 PM$Reviewer: Liliana, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$After several partially successful trials of atypical antiphsychotics, my doctor decided to try loxapine.  I have mild tardive dyskinesia, but it's hard to say if that is due to the loxapine or the high doses of various combinations of atypical antipsychotics I've taken.  It doesn't make me sedated and I've been able to lose all the weight I gained while taking the atypical antipsychotics.  My blood glucose has increased a little since taking it.
