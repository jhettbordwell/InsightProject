3$Condition: Sleep Disturbance with Extreme Anxiety$1/26/2019 10:24:37 PM$Reviewer: Saskatoonian, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on almost every type of benzodiazepine in the last 40 years. I suffer from severe PTSD, have insomnia and suffer from muscle spasms, all due to an MBA I was in in 1984. I have found from all the benzodiazepine family, diazepam works the best for me. The others are all too short acting, or make me feel like a zombie. Valium is definitely the best choice for my ails! I also take Dilaudid and fentanyl for pain and find that with the valium, I can still lead a fairly normal life. 
4$Condition: Anxious$1/8/2019 12:40:04 PM$Reviewer: 75 or over on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$5$4$Been dealing with anxiety and depression since being diagnosed with/treated for prostate cancer in 2000. Take Valium on and off as needed for mild GAD and â??anticipatory anxietyâ?? (i.e. pre-travel). It also helps with morning depression. Itâ??s the only prescription med I take. Have tried several SSRIâ??s with some success, but prefer valium because it works with almost no side effects. While on Valium, after eating a meal, I may doze off for 20 or so minutes. Combination of the meal and the Valium. When taking, usually itâ??s 5mg at bedtime. Sleep better, longer, with fewer disturbing dreams. May take a 2nd 5mg during really anxious days (i.e. when packing for a trip). Will take for a couple of weeks while traveling, and no problem stopping except maybe a day of mild depression. Doesnâ??t conflict with my before-supper 2 glasses of wine, except when on Valium the size of those glasses may be smaller (more relaxed to begin with). According to blood tests over the years, doesnâ??t seem to have affected any vital organs (kidneys, liver). Continues to be a lifesaver!
5$Condition: Other$6/12/2018 1:21:06 AM$Reviewer: kissy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Had to go for a MRI, could not do it, never had been claustrophobic before... been in tanning beds, airplane bathrooms, crowded elevators- no problem!  Putting me into that small tunnel?? Hells no. MRI tech suggested asking for some ativan, xanax or valium.  I called my PCP and xanax was prescribed.  I asked for 2 doses worth so I could try it at home first as I had never taken it. got .05 mg.  Said to take 1 30 min before and take another in 30 min if needed.  So, I did my trial run, ended up taking 2 and felt NOTHING!! About an hour later I started feeling irritable and very impatient!! NOT results conducive of being in a MRI for almost an hour.  Called my ortho who prescribed valium. WOW, what a difference!  He gave me 2 5mg tabs with almost the same directions. Take half a tab then take another half 30 min later if needed.  3 half tabs was the bomb!! I was like - whatever, as I do not give a shit right about now... ultimate chill pill for sure! MRI success!! And I had no problem driving myself home either.  Actually stopped to get groceries on the way. If you need a MRI, go for the gold-the valium, I sure was thankful for it and had no real side effects except for wanting to take a nap later. Best of luck to all!

After a bit over month with valium i feel ready to get a job again. My panic attacks forced me to quit a great job. Valium has given me my sanity back. Im just wary of its addictive potential due to previous history of substance addictions.

I've tried Lyrica, Neurontin is (gabapentin)  they are much stronger, more addictive and have worse side effects. Valium or the generic form has none. I've been able to stop at any time, just have to put up with the muscle pain and mind fog that FMS causes. Tried some of the other drugs, they fogged the mind, or caused insomnia like Xanax did. They are also MORE addictive and you have to be weaned off them. They are also  have more horrid side effects. 1 Lyrica tablet sent me to the ER because the pain it caused sent my BP to heart attack level. Took a week to get the crap out of my system.

I don't take it all the time only when I have consistent anxiety and it does help the awful closed throat, heavy heart feeling I get before I have an anxiety attack. The only problem is if I have a really bad panic attack it takes about 20 minutes to kick in and in those instances it's not quick enough. In general though this has been very effective to help calm me down with no real adverse side effects. This does not make me sleepy or groggy but I know some people that say it's a bit too much. Just watch it because it is a Benzo and it can be addictive. I only use it when I have to and haven't ever felt any withdrawal from starting and stopping as needed but that's not to say someone else wouldn't experience those not so pleasant symptoms listed as possible side effects. Just be cautious and use your better judgement while taking this.

30$Condition: Anxious$1/25/2015 3:02:37 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Valium is the best benzo for long term, chronic anxiety and panic disorder. However, the hardest thing is if you ever have to stop it without switching to another benzo.  The 2 side effects I had were the occasional headache associated with tiredness. Valium has the longest half life of any benzo and that is arguably why it is the hardest to stop after long term use. Be careful.

I had to find a new pain mgmt doc bc I moved from another state. During the search for a new doc sadly had to visit the ED in new state a few times for meds that I needed. Even The docs in new state ED prescribed the Valium for my muscle spasms bc the docs knew I could not stop them in add it made a huge diff in my discomfort. The Valium used in conj w pain med would bring my pain from 10 to a 4 or 5. Within few mins I would feel so much better. So I have been seeing a new pain mgmt doc in my new state for about 5 months however, he DOES NOT LISTEN to me or my concerns. HE REFUSES TO PRESCRIBE MY VALIUM. I leave his office every month crying bc the pain is so bad. He'll give me valium just prior to steroid injections but he still refuses to give me a script for the Valium. He believes that Valium is used only for a gen Anesthesia! And after 2 more injects 2 wks ago I asked yet again - his response (thru his nurse) was ""Ive had this conversation with her many times & I will not give her Valium."" ""his nurse also said Valium is not used for pain"" (of course we all k this is untrue) I immed cried, told the nurse to let him know that if God Forbid anything should happen that he cannot cont his med practice & he ends up in chronic pain as w me & other patients I bet he'll be expected his physician to listen to him. Just bc my doc is 'conservative' it is very ignorant & uncaring of him to ignore me & my pain & refuse to continue one of my meds (Valium) that my prev docs were prescribing to me. He only gives me something for the main phys pain, nothing else. Im going to my GP tm to discuss - perhaps she can help or work as a liason. I may have to find a new doc. The muscle spasms are getting so bad it hurts to breathe. To all others trying to cope w post surg pain my prayers go out to you & good luck."

And safest. Here's why:

1). It's relaxing & uplifting in the most mild way. It doesn't cause wacky behavior nor give the appearance that the user is 'on something'.
2). It's long acting. You don't need to cling to a pill bottle all day. One small dose gives all-day benefit.
3.) It doesn't cause mental depression, like so many minor tranqilizers do.

I like to take a 5 mg. pill in the morning, before work. It 'loosens me up', making that tense pre-workday mood disappear. It helps me organize myself, in a cheerful way. That's the best way I can describe it. I don't take another until the next morning. And many times I don't even need to do that. Diazepam the very best of the benzodiazepines and minor tranquilizers. Speaking from experience."

I don't take Valium during the day usually but if I feel the need I will take 2 mg in the late morning to get through the day.  Mostly I take 4 mg at bedtime to help with sleep and it seems to work but I have tried not taking it sometimes and I don't notice much difference in sleep/not being able to sleep.  I always dream when I take it and sometimes the dreams are disturbing and I wake up frustrated and angry for awhile, which I don't like at all.  I am also on Prozac, 20 mg/day and wish I knew if any of these drugs are really doing anything for me because of my continued symptoms.  I also see a psychiatrist and psychologist.

86$Condition: Muscle Spasm$5/10/2012 6:13:27 AM$Reviewer: BR549, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$From 1995 to present, I have had 11 spine surgeries’, 4 in the low back and 7 in the cervical and thoracic area.  While the pain meds helped, I started having the worse spasms and the muscles in my neck and upper half of the large muscles would literally lockup and cause more pain then I can express. I started out taking Flexeril, Scalaxin, Soma and many others to no avail.  Around 2005, my Doctor switched to 10 mg. Valium 3 times a day, but I usually break them in half when I start to feel the muscles starting to get tight or spasms during day time, and a whole one at bedtime. Tho the spasms are there daily, had it not been for Valium, I don’t know what I would have done. It has truly been a godsend for me personally. The only downside is, if I have to drive myself somewhere, I won’t take it the night before as I don’t want to not be at my full faculty’s while driving, but it’s a tradeoff I accept as I have been totally disabled for about 5 years now. My spouse does 90% of the driving, with me doing about 10%. The reason for this is I know of 2 people that were arrested for driving under the influence while taking this med. I also have first hand knowledge as one of them was a friend I had been warning for years not to take it and drive. So just be very careful and use common sense while taking a 10 mg. Valium and thinking you can drive safely without having an accident that may be minor to major in nature.

90$Condition: Anxious$3/20/2012 1:58:59 AM$Reviewer: Fortressofcomfort, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$Overall diazepam is the best benzo ever.  I suffer from anxiety disorder and occasional panic attack (when anxiety is very high for prolonged periods of time).  Clonazepam turns me into a zombie (good for periods of insomnia though) alprazolam causes me much amnesia and just seems too strong, and lorazepam and Serax just don't last very long requiring multiple doses each day.  I occasionally have my doc switch me around but I always come back to good old Valium.  It just seems to have the best combination of therapeutic action for anxiety and, at 5mg doses, does not turn me into a non functioning zombie or make me sleepy.  Proper use of diazepam has absolutely improved my life overall.  I've been taking 5-10mg a day, a low dose, for 2 years now and would hate to have to give it up.  It is also very non-addictive, and when used appropriately does not have an significant withdrawal symptoms.  For anyone suffering from moderate to severe anxiety, or panic attacks, ask your doctor to let you try simply 5mg of Valium taken in the evening.  Greetings and cheers from a fellow worrywart lol.

I guess it would depend on how many someone is on a day to judge the length of time it would take to clear the system. I found Valium to be one of the most addictive drugs I have ever taken and I would never advise anyone to take it if they have never done so. I believe exercise and proper diet can help sometimes rather than drugs. I would suggest something NOT addictive like this drug if nothing else.
98$Condition: Anxious$12/10/2011 2:26:51 AM$Reviewer: Fortressofcomfort, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Great!  I take 5-10mg a day usually a couple hours before bed.  It allows me to unwind and relax and stops my mind from racing and wandering.  Have taken for 2 yrs now with no side effects.  It is also easy to stop taking (no withdrawal) but it stays in your system (and is detectable in urine) for a good 3 weeks.  The only caveat is that if you abuse it (take too much) it will lead to depression, so stick to the lowest dose that works.  It is also good for occasional insomnia at higher doses (10-15mg) but stops working for that after only a couple days of use.  Summary: an effective old school 'chill pill' that is safe and easy to use.  P.s. I have used Klonipim and Xanax before and actually prefer the Valium because it lasts longer and doesn't make me tired at the usual 5mg dose.  Cheers!

At first I wasn't sure why but when my Gramother's cancer took a turn for the worse i figured it out. After she passed my sleeping habits got worse and the toll of her death really hit me hard. Everything triggered a memory and I would start crying. My Dr. prescribed this for me for both my sleeping problem and taking the edge off when I thought of her. My Dr. prescirbed 2mg 1-2 tabs 4 times a day. I take 2 at bedtime, 1 in the moring, and normally 2 throughout the day. I sleep like a baby now and I'm not crying all day either. I was kinda scared at first to take it because, as a pharmacy tech, I know the bad things that can happen if you abuse it.

I cannot sit or lay down without Severe Chronic Pain. I was FINALLY diagnosed with it this last summer after having it for 11 years. It was caused by a bladder sling put in too tight. I finally got a 2nd opinion and had a doctor try to loosen the sling but it was too late and he knew I had nerve damage just not a name for it at that time. I have to urinate or feel like it constantly and cannot sit without STRONG pain pills and special seating for a SHORT amount of time. It got so bad I could only sleep 1-2 hrs at a time at night for the last 11 years. I would get up in pain, often eat, take meds and finally get back to sleep for 1-2 hrs and then it would happen all over again. Since taking Valium before I go to bed I have slept 5-6 hours at a time, a GOD SEND for me. It relaxes my pelvic muscles enough that I can sleep. I am SO glad it works and hope it works for a long time. I finally got my strong pain meds changed after 11 years because I had built up a tolerance, took them exactly as directed but until the 2nd or 3rd of the day I could not do anything! I was on Lortab 10mg for 11 years and am now on Percocet 7.5 which now brings me the relief the Lortab did YEARS ago. And that relief never takes all the pain away-just the edge off so I can function in short periods of time. I have never felt ""high"" from my pain meds, people in Chronic pain are just trying to get to a more normal existence. I took all test for Pudendal Neuralgia including nerve injections last summer which deadened the nerve for a few hours, trigger point injections etc. So all that diagnosed me with a specialist. There are only 3 surgeons in the U.S. who do a pudendal nerve release operation-there is a 60% chance of recovery and it can take 2-2 1/2 years to see IF it works. I have not opted for that yet! "

128$Condition: Anxious$3/8/2011 1:16:25 PM$Reviewer: LadyOwl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"Valium, aka ""Mommy's lil' helpers"" had been a godsend for me.   I'd been taking it, 10mg tabs, 3x a day, #90/month for 10 years. Now THAT is a miracle as it is. On top of opiate pain meds for chronic back pain as well! All depends on the doctor. Some won't even R/x you an aspirin. 
Well, anyway, since it's so broad, it helped my muscle spasms, GAD, (General Anxiety Disorder) insomnia, migriaines, tension, PTSD, etc. So, that's the good thing about it. 
Bad thing is that after so long, like all the benzodiazapines, you get tolerant to it, and you can take half the bottle, and it doesn't phase you. *NO, I do NOT recommend that, lol)* 
But doc told me after 10+ years (Never asked for an increase in dose ever), the half life is very long, about 3 days. So even though you don't feel it, it's still in your system. So if you pop a Vicodin or something, chances are you're gonna wind up on the floor. That's the downside.
So, as I'm on Methadone 10mg. for chronic back pain, sciatica, Lortab 10mg. for breakthrough pain, (close your mouth, you'll catch a fly), he's decided to cut the Valium, and switch me back to Ativan 1mg. Fine by me, works great, and don't have to worry Doc about the half life. Methadone has a VERY long half life, so I was dancing with death the whole time, and didn't realize it! So, it may be great, but it's a good idea to keep check on your dosage, especially if you're taking opiate painkillers, etc... "

183$Condition: Anxious$1/8/2010 1:58:33 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$5$"I've had 2 separate periods of diazepam use. The first was from 1982-99 for generalized anxiety and Meniere's Disease.  It worked very well for both.  However, I am also a recovering alcoholic who has to be careful with drugs like this and when I got sober in 1999, I quit using valium.  Then this past May (2009), I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and my anxiety (and some Meniere's symptoms like vertigo, etc.)came back roaring. I had shortness of breath and a tremendously amplified startle reflex. So, I asked my GP to put me back on low levels of valium, which he did. He also put me on Ambien. My cancer surgery in July was successful and by October, I felt ready to come off both valium and ambien. But my addictive brain (remember, I'm a recovering drunk) wasn't as ready and I was unsuccessful in my own attempt to taper off either drug.  So, I went to the p-doc at the local rehab center and she put me on Remeron and told me to try and get off the ambien first and we'd worry about the valium later.  So, now about 10 weeks later, I'm off ambien completely and am being maintained on 15mg. remeron and 3mg valium a day. This is a sub-clinical valium dose, but it still helps. We're going to stay here for the next 5 months or so and then, if the Remeron continues to work for me, taper the valium until I'm off it.
  Valium has historically been the only drug that has ever given me relief from my anxiety and I've been through a bushel basket of others from Buspar to Luvox to Lexapro. But because of my addictive personality, I need to be off it eventually.
And that's OK so long as the Remeron keeps working.
  So, with some reservations, I'd recommend short-course valium therapy to anybody with severe situational anxiety.  It works.  Watch it though and don't stay on it too long.  It makes all the sharp corners of the world round and while that is a nice feeling, it isn't the way the world really is. Be cautious with this drug, especially if you are prone to addiction."

The times without it, I tried every alternative treatment. And many psychiatrists plus psychologists and social workers. Bottom line, my life is normal when I have it. I am a basket case without it.  I have gone as much as 2 years off it, and those 2 years were hell for me.  I was given every anti-drepressant on the market but none of them took care of my anxiety and I have never had a problem with depression. Some doctors tried them to get me off valium, but they did not work on me. If I were 25, I wouldn't start it again because I know it's addictive, I read things. But at 66, I don't want to live without it after all this time.

I was originally prescribed this because of several reasons; TMJ, PTSD, & insomnia. The 2nd night off of the med was when the withdrawl took effect. Over the course of the next 2wks, I felt near death, it was VERY scary. My blodd pressure soared to 158/128, had blurry vision al day, could not sleep for more that 45 mins @ at a time, sick to stomach, trembles, & basicall just felt like dying. While waiting to be seen for a new Dr, a family member provided me with Valium. I found it to be less ""harse"" with the same effcts,& if a miss a night or two, I don't feel much different. My new Dr gives me Ambien 10mg..it works O.K. for about 2 hrs then I wake up @ least 4 other times for a minute or two, just to toss & turn. To sum up my experience w/Xanax, Valium, & Ambien...Xanax is great if you have it but dangerous if you do not. Ambien wks just not long enough. Valium is the best by far. Relief without anyside effects.

My only qualm is that I am physically dependent on the benzodiazepine, but I don't experience withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose because of the long half-life.  

I started out on Xanax back in the 1990s, and it had the opposite effect.  I asked my PCP if I could switch from 4 mg Xanax to 40 mg Valium each day.  He said okay.  Unfortunately, Xanax and Valium are not pharmacologic substitutes.  Forty-eight hours later, I developed seizures.  It was the scariest experience of my life."

That day I stopped the psychoanalysis because (thank god!!!)the analyst should to into retirement, that day I started Valium (diazepam) 5mg/day again and IMMEDIATELY!!!!! got back to senses. How could I be so deceived by that shrink and not listen to school-medicine doctors!! Well an analysis-shrink colleague of him also having a radio show - praising the analysis - admitted in a book after his retirement that he had taken, wait ...Valium over all the years to manage his anxiety !!!!! (strong to do that) Well we know priests preaching A but doing P !!! I'm amazed when people now can report themselves, to see how great help this medicine is and how very, very few have any problems. Of course as chronic anxiety disorder is CHRONIC ... the anxiety will reappear when you stop the medication. The blood-sugar would certainly go up if stopped insulin !!!! Talk about being dependent on INSULIN.
I HOPE internet medical fora can force the psychotherapeutic maffia to where it belongs. The scrapyard!!!!
