Also this drug should never be described for pwople who have diabetes as it caused me,(and my daughter who was also prescribed) to crave nothing but sweets.  We both gained over 40 pounds. Nothing else food-wise was satisfactory we truly craved sweets.  I will never take this medicine again not Remeron.

8$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$3/9/2019 12:19:49 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been using this medication in combination with prazosin to treat PTSD and related symptoms. I'm also recovering from long term drug and alcohol abuse. At first my primary care physician had me on Prozac which I only took for a few days because it seemed to have a paradoxical effect making my symptoms worse. So I returned to illegal drug use for over a year before returning to my PCP. This time around I was diagnosed with PTSD as opposed to the major depressive disorder I was currently diagnosed with. With this in mind my doctor prescribed mirtazapine in conjunction with the high blood pressure medication prazosin which has been shown to reduce nightmares in PTSD patients. I had terrible nightmares and was averaging about 2-3 hours of sleep a night if I was lucky. Once one the medication combination I was able to sleep for a solid 8 hours. I take it at about 9pm. It doesn't knock me out immediately. I can stay up an watch a movie if I like but if I get the slightest bit comfortable then I'm out. The first week I still woke up groggy and the nightmares started to change to just vivid dreams. I still have some but it is much less frequent and I have more control to simply open my eyes if it gets too rough. They seem to be waning off. I'm less irritable now and my blood pressure is finally getting under control since my stress is lower which was the main cause of my blood pressure issues according to my doctor.

18$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$10/29/2017 1:21:58 PM$Reviewer: Adonedunn, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$4$I've tried other drugs, such as zoloft and lexapro and neither of these seemed to help whatsoever. I was very discouraged, I was afraid nothing would ever work. My psychiatrist prescribed me Mirtazapine and I was skeptical to try something new. I began to notice a difference in the first few weeks. My appetite was much greater than it had been, which was okay because I was underweight. The sedation did not occur which was surprising, but I guess everyone is different. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something to help them out, if you're willing to gain a few pounds!

21$Condition: Other$6/19/2017 11:01:24 AM$Reviewer: DaveAD, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Best for chronic insomnia as it does not change sleep architecture and can be used for long-term or sporadically.

25$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$10/21/2016 4:45:49 AM$Reviewer: Tristan1996, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Been on the tablets for 2 months now at 15mg doses. I feel a lot better in myself. No more insomnia, depression or anxiety. My appetite has improved (people have been known to gain weight on this medication so make sure you keep tabs on your weight and diet!). Considering that in June I was hospitalized twice after suicide attempts and now I feel like I could rule the world is definitely saying something. I would still be in that rut if it wasn't for this medication. I would definitely recommend this to everybody. It also starts working a lot quicker than other medications. Sertraline (Zoloft) for example took 6 weeks to start working on me and included vile side effects. Mirtazapine just makes me feel quite drowsy (which is a benefit as my sleep has improved as a result of that particular side effect). You can slo get some crazy dreams on this medication. I have had so many adventures you would not believe it! So overall I can say that Mirtazapine has worked the best out of all the medication I have been on in the past and started working very quickly. I felt back to my old self in about 2-3 weeks of taking this drug. Thumbs up from me!

28$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$8/11/2016 5:00:22 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been taking this medication for 5 weeks now due to post traumatic stress which I avoided seeing a Dr about for a year - I have severe anxiety and panic attacks - the Dr prescribed me 15mg a night. The first two weeks I was asleep within half an hour of taking it and then I struggled to sleep on the third week, but now I have a normal sleeping pattern. I usually have vivid dreams but they have become more bizarre and so vivid that I genuinely feel they were real events. I still suffer with dry mouth and I noticed that I became very agitated. Unfortunately the agitation and irritable side effects are yet to wear off but in this last week they have slightly lessened. When you take this you will have to expect that some symptoms will get worse before getting better so you may have to trudge through it like I have. It isn't a drug that will feel like it causes miracles straight away but I'm 5 weeks in and starting to be able to go out my house a bit more. I still feel a sense of panic but I am starting to control it again which is what I wanted. I may have my dose increased again in a few weeks so I'm sure there will be more side effects to come.

33$Condition: Depression$6/19/2016 2:17:02 AM$Reviewer: pistvet, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$My VA therapist gave me this. Started at 7.5, then 15mg. Then my next visit I was shocked to hear that I was to start taking 30mg. I TOLD her that that was too much, that the 15mg dose was affecting me strongly already, why 30mg? Started having muscle pain around my ribs so bad I couldn't sleep. Got so logy I walked in front of traffic. Put on 20lbs(2 weeks after quitting, down 10, so far very easy to do). This lasted about a month(you can't get a VA therapist appt. less than 6 weeks away). I stayed up long enough one night that the drug's effects lessened to the degree that I realized what was happening and reduced the dosage myself to 15mg. Wouldn't have been so bad if I would've been taken off the Trazodone first, but I wasn't. The 2 drugs together overloaded my liver apparently, thus magnifying the effects. 
34$Condition: Depression$6/9/2016 2:30:11 PM$Reviewer: Lisa, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$2$I started taking this at 7.5mg for a month and then was upped to 15mg for the second month. It took me 2 weeks for my body to adjust to this. The first 2 weeks I slept a lot and found it hard to function. I had a slightly increased appetite and have gained 15-20 pounds since I first started on this. I used to have serious bouts of insomnia but not since I started taking this. At first all I did was sleep and then I felt more regulated and I slept more normal but not great. I did feel tired a lot during the day through the whole 2 months I was on this but I am not going to be taking it anymore because of weight gain. I also felt dizzy in the first 2 weeks and for the whole 2 months at bedtime one of my legs would feel tingly and would involuntarily move like restless leg syndrome. I would have stopped taking this immediately but my doctor made me continue with it and now 20 pounds later I will try something else.

I finally went to a psychiatric center a few weeks ago and was immediately put on Mirtazapine- 30mg each night. So far, all this medication has done is make me constipated, teary/easily irritated, and able sleep like a rock. The doctor said this dosage would help my energy levels-- so ****ing much for that! I could easily sleep 12 hours straight on this. I also have had several of these episodes of deep anger/frustration/non-stop crying that last for hours. Not a good sign. I also have an obvious weight issue and need to lose quite a bit, and I do not want to continue taking Mirtazapine if it's just going to sabotage my efforts. Now I'm wondering WTF the doctor was thinking. Luckily my next appointment is in a couple days- you bet I'm going to complain.

The withdrawel symptoms were like small shock waves in my brain for at least a month. Now, was put on Abilify and cannot wait to stop taking it. I feel useless I have no energy and fell depressed. I want to mention one more thing about Mirtazaphine oral, yes, it can lead to weight gain. I have gained 40 lbs since I've been on this drug.

When I woke up the next day, 12 hours later, I was in a very irritated mood. That continued all day along with extreme appetite increase. Almost completed first week. Vivid dreams, some good, most bad, I remember the dreams long after waking up, which is something I haven't done in my life prior to this. No change in depression symtoms. I have gained 10lbs, almost can't get a full feeling after eating. I'm afraid to go to sleep because of vividness and content of dreams. My mood is so irritated and short with people I don't like being around anyone including friends. This is the first time I have taken anything for depression. I have one more week til I see my doctor. I will be hoping to switch to another drug.

I have to be honest and say I only took this drug for a few days.  I stopped right away after I found myself not being able to sleep very well, waking from sleep or a nap with my heart pounding against my chest; being extremely short of breath. It gave me panic attacks, which only exacerbated my shortness of breath and heartbeat. I had read a great deal of the reviews on here, and thought Yay, I'm going to finally get some sleep.  Not so at all. I was terribly disappointed, and being short of breath with my heart pounding prevented me from going anywhere.  It was a chore to walk in my apartment without getting winded.  Forget going out to the store or pharmacy. 

While I don't think I am in the majority, this situation happens to me quite a bit. If a drug makes others sleep, it keeps me awake. I plan on asking my psychiatrist to put me back on Nortriptyline during the day, and Trazadone at night.  I'm disappointed, but cannot wait 1 - 4 weeks for this drug to take effect."

First was the effect on sleep which was awesome and for me always half of the battle. If I get decent sleep, everything else is easier to handle. And after a couple of months my anxiety has completely disappeared and my outlook has become actually optimistic which blows my mind as I did not realize one can feel this way.

It acts upon your h(histamine) receptors and glucose assimilation, thus the side effects such as drowsiness, weight gain, and anti-nausea properties.

This is the second time in my life that I have used it and, frankly, it is the only med that has ever worked for me.  If you are clinically depressed or experience severe anxiety issues that have led you to the point that you cannot function in life (re: insomnia, anorexia, panic, emerging agoraphobia, etc.) then this drug may very well help you.  Both times I have been severely underweight and Remeron has helped me to maintain a normal weight and rid me of constant nausea and anxiety and a specific phobia. When taken along with extra magnesium, the only side effects I've experienced are swelling of the feet and food cravings.  All of the other meds I've taken have either not worked or made me feel even more nuts than I felt originally. "
103$Condition: Depression$4/28/2013 3:46:12 PM$Reviewer: Matt, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$5$I've been taking the 30mg tablets for maybe 8 months now and they do what they're supposed to. I found it took a week or two to start getting used to them. They help with sleep maybe too much. They force me to sleep about 8 hours even through a couple alarm clocks going off by my head for a couple hours. I've stopped taking them before because of this and was fine for a couple days but found the littlest thing would set me off so I started taking a half a night for a couple nights and back to the full 30mg. I've been off them again now for about a week and the first couple days weren't bad but I'm finding now that the daily thoughts of suicide are coming back so I think tonight I'll start taking them again. I strongly recommend not trying to take yourself off of these pills without your docs approval. He said it usually takes 9 months to cure depression but I think it may take a bit longer so be patient. Try getting to bed at least 8 hours before you're supposed to be up. They take maybe about a half hour to an hour to start working but make sure you don't have to do anything after you've taken them because they knock me right out cold. I've found that they do increase your appetite and you may gain a few pounds but chances are you'll lose it pretty fast after your treatment. Just being off of them for a week I've found that I'm not as hungry and probably have lost 2 or 3 pounds but losing the few pounds isn't worth taking the chance of worsening your depression. Hope this helps but please for the sake of yourself and the people in your life, don't stop taking them until your doctor thinks you're ready to.

I've taken a number of different meds for severe depression and anxiety.  After I got cancer in 2008 things got much worse.  I went about 20 years sleeping 3-4 hours a night with fainting spells from anxiety attacks.  The cancer just made that worse.  I was a mess.  I started with 15mg, and slowly worked up to 45mg which is what I needed.  The first two weeks I couldn't sleep enough.  I had a hard time staying awake.  After that I leveled out.  I've been taking it for about 2 1/2 years.

My life has changed.  Stable relationships, now marriage and a son, a few promotions at work, the fog has lifted.  The sadness has lifted.  Now I might have a bad day from time to time, but who doesn't?  I used to have bad months and months at a time.

Weight gain is a well know side effect of this medication.  I've gained 20 pounds, but leveled off at 20.  I try to watch what I eat.  My stomach doesn't rumble or anything like that, but I just crave sugar all the time.  If you can keep yourself in check you will be fine.

Taking this medication at night time is a must.  It knocks me out.  My dreams are AMAZING!  Like Hollywood blockbuster dreams.  It's probably the coolest side effect I've had in a medication (outside of tripping my balls off when they had me on Ambien 10 years ago).

For me, this is a wonder drug.  It's lifted my sadness off of me, and when I do get down, I bounce back MUCH faster that ever in my life.  If you get the dosage right you will be good to go."

My first pill of 7 mg put me in zombie-like state for about 48hrs. Never take the full dose the first time, I'd suggest nibbling a corner and on a weekend when you can recover if its too strong. I couldn't drive or do even light work. 7 months later I'm now up to 30mg at bedtime and haven't slept like this in years! I take it at 8pm to fall asleep by 10 at the latest. Deep, undistrubed sleep and no grogginess next day. Sadly though, I'm begining to taper as I've gained about 40 pounds even though I've always been thin my entire life. I dream of food on this drug & keep eating even when I'm full! It did nothing for my depression so when addition of Wellbutrin did nothing I've finally found relief with 175mg of Effexor XR. I'm hoping now that the Effexor will cure my depression and the sleep issues I struggled with for so many years. Good luck to everyone out there. This is a trial and error process.

I think it is useless as a sleep helper as it's 1st and foremost used to treat depression. I already take Effexor for depression (works to a pt.) but Mirtaz for sleep-forget about it! Would be better off eliminating it and increasing one of the other ""sleep meds"" I current take!"

Several years of insomnia both before and after I divorced four years ago. I wouldn't call myself depressed but an extremely busy mind and some major spikes in anxiety keeps me awake unless I'm working out in the woods. 

I also have anger issues. Well. I'm sleeping very deeply now and my concentration has gone up and anger has subsided - although I did see a therapist during this as well, so I'm not sure what's causing the subsidence in anger. Seems like it creeps back when I go on ""drug-holidays"". My weight hasn't fluctuated much. I'm a runner and frequently my work takes me into outdoor, backcountry environments so I'm always burning calories. Not sure I notice an extreme increase in what has always been an active appetite.Thee has been some. 

The dreams are pretty intense and interesting. I relish being able to dream deeply. Sometimes they get disturbing but that may be my brain crunching it's way through problems and past hurts while in hibernation mode. 

The big thing is, I'm sleeping again and it's a way more forgiving sleep drug than the ""classic"" sleep meds that are out there. Both cause longer sleep periods but I'm less groggy w/ the Mirtazapine then pretty much all the other sleeping meds I've tried. 

Lack of sleep slowly kills."

136$Condition: Depression$2/5/2012 7:55:48 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$1$I was prescribed this medication to help my insomnia caused by severe depression. After being released from the hospital I weighed 123 pounds which was low for me. I was unable to sleep and many sleeping medicines were ineffective. They would put me to sleep, but I couldn't stay asleep. My doctor  switched me to mirtazapine, thinking that it would help. While it has made me sleep the side effects have been miserable. The medicine puts you into such a deep sleep that your dreams are insanely vivid. I can't wake myself up from them, and I wake up most days so upset from the dreams. One day in particular I had my pillow in a headlock and was repeatedly punching it, all while in a deep sleep. It is a frustrating medication to be on. Not to mention I am a very healthy person, I eat mainly fruits, veggies and lean proteins. I also work out 3-5 times a week. I am now up to 135 pounds which is high for me. It is also very frustrating as I put a lot of effort into eating right and exercising. It is also not helpful for my depression. The continual weight gain is very aggravating and certainly does not help with self-esteem and depression issues. I requested at my last appointment being switched to something else, but my doctor told me that it can't make you gain weight, only increase your appetite. I think however, that the next time I go I will be insistent that we switch.

Went to Prozac, worked for me like a charm. No side effects at all and it seems to work very well for my  anxiety. Stay away from the other stuff, it's evil.

I was only sleeping about four hours a night and then be wide awake for the next three hours, only to doze off and on the last hour.  Then I had some disturbing traumatic information, and found myself only sleeping two hours each night, and a heaviness in my chest.  Couldn't concentrate or eat.  My doctor put me on this medication, and from day one has been great!  Sleep through the night, eat, no heaviness.  But after the first month of medication (purchased through Walgreens), I had my medication changed to be sent through the mail through CVS/Caremark.  THIS medication is completly different.  Can't sleep through the night, constipated, and other symptoms people talk of.  Talked to my doctor and got some more medication through Walgreens, and I'm back to sleeping through the night again.  BEWARE, just because the name of the med is the same, it may work different.  Walgreens is an oval shaped pill, and CVS is round.

Side effects of severe headache and intense hunger disappeared on Day 7. However, at my first refill the pharmacy used a different manufacturer, TEVA. 11 days later I have stopped taking this drug altogether. My symptoms were consistent with my normal reactions to wheat and dairy. Called TEVA and they say it does not contain gluten, but it does contain lactose, which is derived from milk. HOWEVER, they do not use a gluten-free facility so cross-contamination could very easily occur. I do NOT have Celiacs disease, but I am gluten intolerant although I can consume gluten on occasion in small quantities. I had a severe gluten type reaction which included bloating (I went from slim and trim to looking 7 months pregnant in 5 days, with no weight gain; flu-like symptoms, chills and shivering (temps outside were 100 degrees, 80 inside), always felt like I had overeaten even when I had eaten nothing; sinuses stuffed up like I had a head cold, dry scratchy throat; general feeling of malaise. 56 hours after my last dose I am finally starting to feel ""normal"" again.

I'm not sure if my reaction was manufacturer-based, or if it was a build-up in my system of mirtazapine. I was taking 15mg once a day."

Also extremely hyper sensitive to sounds, light and felt like I had sensory overload all the time. immediatly got off after I found myself sleep walking to the other side of my house only to wake up because I bumped into a chair. This medicine made me fell like a different person in a negative sense. Hard to wake up, did not get any rest when sleeping and started hallucinating.

However one of the side effects not listed about Remeron/Mirtazpine is it will lower your sex drive at least in my case and give you weaker erections. I've asked my doctor if there were sexual side effects and he said no. The medication helps me sleep when i take ambian and xanax along with it. I was told it would help my anxiety throughout the day replacing the xanax but it doesn't for me. I sleep better but feel just as anxious thorough the day. My xanax is the only thing i can take as needed to keep my at a relaxed state which seems over active to most people including doctors.

I was up-ed from 30mg to 45 mg and Im starting to get major mood swings, and crying spells, so I am slowly tapering off to 15mg (Ive never been on anything less then 30mg), to see if I get the same therapy effect without these side effects (weight gain, spacey, mood swings, etc..) I am not Bi-Polar, I am OCPD/GAD/OCD/Panic Disorder. As Im tapering off I seem to be getting better, even my anxiety has gone down. Im off Lamictal (horrible side effects and withdrawals.) So hopefully the 15 mg is the right thing for me. The doc says I have to be on a depression pill (I dont know why.) And of all the other pills Ive tried, Ive liked this one the best, so hopefully it will all work out.

Currently I take welbutrin 450/day for depression, concerta 36/day for adhd, luvox 150/day for ocd and trazidone 150/day for anxiety and sleep. Remiron was to replace the luvox and trazidone hoping to re-instate sex drive. Now using Remiron 15/day for 2 weeks. I usualy don't remember dreams. Some med adjustments caused interesting vivid dreams but these are nasty and i wake very uncomfortable. On the positive side, I felt too buzzed at first so the other meds slowly became reduced. Now taking welbutrin 150/day, concerta 18/day. I feel great!!! (Jury is still out on sex issues but i see improvment)  Maybe after 20 years i have the correct med. I'm hoping (with doc) to eliminate all but the remiron. Only God knows for shure so I'll keep the faith!!!  Good luck all and Don't Give Up!!

Couldn't sleep, losing weight, anxious with panic attacks. Initially tried on a SSRI but had EXTREME increase in anxiety and panic. Tried low dose mirtazepine (7.5 mg) and it worked beautifully. Anxiety under control, no panic attacks, appetite back (OK for me - skinny).

The drug gave me only minor sedation. Here's a trick: this drug can be way too sedating for some especially at low dose. The reason is mostly due to the fact it is a strong antihistamine. So if you are considering this med try 50 mg of Benadryl. If that whacks you out probably best to avoid mirtazapine but if the Benadryl has no sedative properties for you then this might well be a good choice."

When I first started on them I was sick, stomach upset, and yelling angry but stuck with it and that has gone away (I was also on Clonazpine which may have caused some of that). The only side effects I have now are weight gain (which Im learning to control), no energy (but seemes to be getting better), and get irritated easily. Im also on Lorazepam to help sleep, for RLS, and also panic attacks. Im also bi-polar so Im starting to take Lacimtal. I hope this works, because Im sick of trying diff meds. My husband says hes glad to have me back, Im smiling and laughing more now then I have in a long time, and there are times when Im almost 100% again. However, I seem to be loosing the connection lately. Im going to stick with it though, because this is the best thats worked so far.

At first, it was fantastic. I took it about an hour before my target bedtime, got to sleep with no problem, and had the most amazing, vivid dreams. It made me feel calm during the day, relieving the symptoms of my anxiety. 

At first, the side effects were minimal. Around the third month, things started to get bad; I had uncontrollable cravings for candy every night, and it became difficult to get up in the morning without multiple alarm clocks and prescription stimulants. I never believed that a drug could cause such an intense craving...but it was as strong as a smoker's craving for a cigarette after not having one for 10 hours. The drug no longer made me go to sleep, either; I started taking it about two hours before my target bedtime, and ended up wandering around the house like a zombie for five or six hours, not able to remember what I had done the next day. 

I tried really hard to work with the drug, but the side effects began to outweigh the benefits. I tried eating less, exercising a whole lot, and replacing candy with fruit, but still managed to gain 30 pounds...25% of my initial body weight. People started asking if I was pregnant. The zombie feeling was affecting my work, and rather than taking advantage of my insomnia like I used to, I found that I couldn't go to sleep, couldn't get up in the morning, and couldn't do anything at night after taking the medication, despite being awake. 

I stopped taking the drug about a month ago, and despite being slightly more anxious, I feel better overall. I'm no longer taking daytime stimulants, and even though I still can't sleep at night, at least I have those hours back. I feel like I own my body again, and I can enjoy eating food like I used to. I gave this drug a fair shot, but to me, the side effects outweighed the benefits"

Turns out I would have had everything to lose because Remeron has been a wonder drug for me.  8 years later, I'm still smiling and upbeat.  Loving every bit of this!  It even helped me quit smoking too!  And here's a little secret most docs don't know much about...often ADD can be masked within depression because they are so well coupled together.  Taking a med like Add-eral along with this this med has been the perfect combo for me! SO AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I WANT to get up in the mornings because there's stuff I WANT to do.  And the Adderal gives me the focus and energy to get it done.  It also helped me bring my weight down to the perfect size.

I slept for 12 hours. The third night I had to take the full 15 mg dosage. Pros: Anxiety level seems to be lower, Sleeping through the night. Cons: Lethargic throughout day, hard to get up in the AM, dry mouth, massively increased appetite, decrease in energy level. Probly too early to see how this affects my depression but right now I'm not happy feeling like a zombie all day and being hungry all the time. Will see the Dr. in a week.

I'm trusting in God with this medication and praying that it willa ctually work. I don't like feeling the way I am."

I don't know how much longer I can go on without weight gain. I feel that inevitably I will succumb to a significant increase in weight. It's like having the munchies when I was self medicating. It’s a bummer because it works well for me for depression and against anxiety. I got off my previous depression medication because of the lack of sex drive. Now there’s no affect on sex drive but who wants the extra 25 to 30 lbs. It’s like someone mentioned in a previous review a trial and error (hit and miss) type proposition.

I have experienced constant thirst no matter how much I drink. Sometimes my heart feels like it will jump from my chest, not beating fast, just very hard. It has also caused my sex drive to drop significantly. If I miss my dose, it makes me feel like I am going crazy (for real), and I start to get very bad headaches until I take my dose.

So I wouldn't recommend that.  I've been on it for 2 months, thinking about going without and see what happens.  I am taking it in conjunction with Effexor XL.  Note: My Dr. said increasing my dosage will not increase in grogginess.  So if your taking it as a sleep aid, try the lowest dose (1/2 of a 15mg). I know that sounds weird but I have found that sometimes increasing your dosage, like say Effexor, sometimes decreases your side effects. Hummm go figure.  Good Luck to All.

This drug should NOT be given as a sleeping pill and other health facts such as SEVERE weight gain should be listed.This drug is making me eat excessively and smoke excessively. I have no control over this and this in its self is now making me depressed. Insomnia was my problem not depression.

It worked good - too good.  I had trouble waking up in the morning and often slept through my alarm.  I started taking it earlier in the evening (around 7:00pm).  This worked great. Slept soundly.  Then I noticed I was gaining weight quickly. I gained 25 pounds in 3 months.  My appetite increased - I especially craved sweets.  I told my doctor that the weight gain made me even more depressed and I felt terrible.  My clothes wer too tight, nothing fit me anymore. I stopped taking it and right away, I could not sleep.  I was lucky if I got 3 hours of sleep a night.  I started to lose weight though - lost about 4 pounds but then had trouble sleeping.  My doctor put me on 7.5 milligrams per night.  I gained the 4 pounds back immediately.  I stopped taking it.  My doctor put me on Seroquel.  I'm going to try it but if it makes me eat more or gain weight, I will stop taking it.

Somehow i never build a tolerance to it!  My body built up tolerance to Ambien Cr 12.5, Lunesta 3mg, Rozerem 8mg, Seroquel 100 mg, but Remeron (mirtazipine) has not!  The only downfall is that it is difficult to wake up, plus i take this with a 2mg Ativan and its the perfect combination for my extreme insomnia/depression.

I take it for PTSD, Anxiety and Depression.  It has really seemed to help a great deal.  I have experienced a strange side effect though. I've developed either PAD or RLS.  My doctor and I are working to find out if it's specifically the medication or whether it's merely exacerbating an already existent condition.  Also tried to take it in the morning to balance out the drowsiness and it has helped a great deal.  I take my dose have a cup or two of coffee and I'm good to go.  Have a strange feeling of tension on occasion as well, much like if my whole body were tense in anticipation of a blow or some sort of action or reaction.  (It's really hard to describe)  Going to give it the good ol' college try and we shall see how steady she sails.

In one year I started a new job, my oldest went away to college, my dad had 2 brain surgeries, my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer and died, and I also lost another very close relative. I have tried many anxiety meds and had bad side effects. The only thing that worked was Lorazapam. Which I was taking 3x a day. I quit taking it last August. I was too foggy all day. I have also been taking Mirtazapine for almost 2 years. I love sleeping all night, with no dreaming. I hate going to bed at 8:30 pm, dragging out at 7am, and being foggy for half the morning. I hate no sex, swelling in hands and feet, dry mouth, gaining 45 lbs, memory issues. I was taking 15 mg and started cutting the pill in half(doctor's orders)last October. That did not help. So my doctor had me stop taking the Mirtazapine last Friday night and start taking Sertraline(Zoloft)25 mg. each morning. I did good until last night. I woke up at midnight with terrible anxiety. I haven't had that in a long time. I took 2 Lorazapam and they didn't help much. I finally fell asleep sometime in the morning. Today I have anxiety, did not go to work. I called the nurse and she thinks I should take the Sertraline at night.I'm thinking the anxiety is withdrawals. I want to go back to the Mirtazapine, to make this go away.

Taken in addendum to Citalopram Hydorbromide(Celexa).  Total effects have not been noted thus far.  Taken for three months now.  Increased appetite, loss of any sexual ambition, outstanding sedation leading to some rather sound sleeping.  Also Prescribed Ropinirole for RLS and Tremor that was caused by either the Celexa or the Mirtrazapine.  Weight gain of about 5 pounds.  Curbing the hunger issues was much easier with fruit/vegetable juice combination and hydrating well.  I believe that this has done well to assist where Effexor could not.

I had been on anti-depressants for about 4years for depression & anxiety but slowly tapered off months ago cuz I had been feeling much better & cuz I thought my problems wer side-effects from the meds. I haven't been depressed at all sense I quit taking em but I told my neurologist about everything afew months ago when I started seeing him for the tremors. After trying afew meds out & having bad reactions, he prescribed me a dose of 15m of Remeron at nite & the pharmacist gave me Mirtazapine. I've only been on it a couple weeks but I already gained bout 20pounds & my shaking isn't any better at all. I find that I get hungrier than I used to so I'm eating alot more. Another major side-effect I'm having from Mirtazapine is that I'm zoning out alot. Like rite before I started typing this post I knew exactly what I wanted to say but by the time I typed the 1st 2lines, I forgot it. I find I've been kina clumsy like bumping into or dropping things. I also notice that I have less energy & sleep more to. I'm seeing my doc again in a few days so hopefully the nite before I see him will be my last time taking this. Least this didn't make me sick to my stomach like the other meds I've been trying lately.

It was about 6AM before I finally fell asleep. So, I guess I can add one more anti depressant to the list of ""tried and didn't work"". The list is long and full of names you'd recogninze if you've been treated for depression. I am also very nauseous and have a headache that won't quit. So, this isn't working for me at all.

But since the side affects, also directly affect me, I feel qualified to critique the med.  When the dr. put him on this drug, he completely lost interest in me.  Sexually and otherwise, and reduced our relationship to nothing more than a friendship.  How do I know it's the meds?  Because before Remeron, we had what others would call a ""normal"" sex life.  He's been on this med since late 2005.  Since that time, we've had sexual relations 3 times.  Yes, his depression and anxiety got better, but look at the cost.  Because of this, I see divorce in our future.  I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone, unless they're single and practicing abstinence."

332$Condition: Depression$7/7/2008 1:54:42 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have an undiagnosed stomach problem that left me unable to eat for months. Due to that, I became depressed and suicidal. The doctor suggested remeron at 45mg. It knocked me out ten minutes after I took it, but the next day, I was able to eat and I haven't had that stomach issue much since then. The only fly in the ointment is that the pill makes me ravenous now. I've gained like 50lbs since December (I was put on it in March of '07) and the doctor wants me to stop taking it. The bad thing there is that when I stop taking it, my mood goes downhill and my stomach starts acting up again. So it's either be fat and sane or skinny and suicidal. I think I'll keep my sanity. Thanks.

334$Condition: Other$5/27/2008 4:21:36 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I've had trouble sleeping and had an panic attack because my husband and I are having problems.  My B/P was 160/110.  The doctor prescribed this medication for me.  Instructions were to take half of the 15 mg tablet for 2 days then one table in the evening thereafter.  I took 1/2 of the pill and was out like a light!  The next day, I could hardly get out of bed and felt like a zombie even 24 hours after taken that small amount.  I can't function feeling as groggy as I did and have not taken anymore of this medication.  Plus, all the comments of the weight gain really concerns me.  I just stick with Xanax for my panic attacks and sleeplessness.  I'm not depressed so maybe this is better for those who are.

336$Condition: Other$5/20/2008 1:26:21 AM$Reviewer: spikeybb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$"I  was prescribed this drug because of insomnia and aggitation.(I recently suffered severe panic attacks due to stress). I was prescribed the 30mg tabs.
At first the Dr told me to take 1 at night which I did. I don't remember falling asleep and slept like a log. In fact my husband had to shake me to waken me the next morning. I woke up with the driest mouth and felt like I had been run over by a bus. No energy whatsoever. So, the next night I tried half of one tablet. Almost the same effect. I just could not function the next morning. I know that it says not to break or crush the tabs but I am now taking 1/4 of a tab every night and it seems the perfect dose for me. I have a great nights sleep and wake up refreshed. My Dr thinks I am taking half each night (15mg). I'm not game to tell him that i take 1/4. I asked him for a lower dose and he said that 30mg was the lowest. Anyway, I feel fine and I am now sleeping well. I don't seem to be aggitated any more either and I most definately have not noticed any difference in my appetite. I have not gained weight. The only thing that worries me about this medication is that it says not to stop taking them abruptly. I wonder what what happen!! Sounds ominous. I don't want to be taking meds all my life and will talk to my Dr about slowly coming off them when he feels the time is right. Another point is, it is important to take them every night and not skip any doses. They will not be as effective if you do that. They are not addictive so that is one good thing. What they actually do is restore the natural chemical balance of your brain. They get a thumbs up from me."
337$Condition: Depression$5/14/2008 4:09:56 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I was placed on this medication as an addition to another antidepressant because I was having trouble getting to sleep and remaining asleep.  It has helped me immensely, and I feel well rested when I wake up in the morning.  I have noticed that within 30 min of taking it I am pretty much asleep, so I really try to take it right before I go to bed.  This medication has really helped my overall mood as well.
