I am taking this specifically for sleeping hey what's happened trouble getting to sleep at night until I started on this drug. I found that I was also depressed from the loss of my husband therefore this was the reason I was having problems sleeping

13$Condition: Depression$6/19/2016 2:17:02 AM$Reviewer: pistvet, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$My VA therapist gave me this. Started at 7.5, then 15mg. Then my next visit I was shocked to hear that I was to start taking 30mg. I TOLD her that that was too much, that the 15mg dose was affecting me strongly already, why 30mg? Started having muscle pain around my ribs so bad I couldn't sleep. Got so logy I walked in front of traffic. Put on 20lbs(2 weeks after quitting, down 10, so far very easy to do). This lasted about a month(you can't get a VA therapist appt. less than 6 weeks away). I stayed up long enough one night that the drug's effects lessened to the degree that I realized what was happening and reduced the dosage myself to 15mg. Wouldn't have been so bad if I would've been taken off the Trazodone first, but I wasn't. The 2 drugs together overloaded my liver apparently, thus magnifying the effects. 
14$Condition: Depression$6/9/2016 2:30:11 PM$Reviewer: Lisa, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$2$I started taking this at 7.5mg for a month and then was upped to 15mg for the second month. It took me 2 weeks for my body to adjust to this. The first 2 weeks I slept a lot and found it hard to function. I had a slightly increased appetite and have gained 15-20 pounds since I first started on this. I used to have serious bouts of insomnia but not since I started taking this. At first all I did was sleep and then I felt more regulated and I slept more normal but not great. I did feel tired a lot during the day through the whole 2 months I was on this but I am not going to be taking it anymore because of weight gain. I also felt dizzy in the first 2 weeks and for the whole 2 months at bedtime one of my legs would feel tingly and would involuntarily move like restless leg syndrome. I would have stopped taking this immediately but my doctor made me continue with it and now 20 pounds later I will try something else.

Dosage doubled at that time and sleep returned with dreams.  10 weeks on still sleeping, dreaming longer and sleeping 7-9hrs nightly.  Eating improved (ocular melanoma/1 year out)and weight gain is OK. Feeling SOOOO much better since deep sleep returned. Works with sertraline daytimes.  Overall pain greatly reduced.

19$Condition: Depression$9/16/2015 11:49:45 PM$Reviewer: jswell, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Aside from weight gain, I have been on Mirtazapine 30 mg for years, along with other meds. I eat like a bird, and I cannot lose weight.  No panic attacks. I also take Klonopin at night, so I sleep very well. I would not take this if I were working. I think the combination of my meds contribute to my weight gain. I get protein, but don't eat more than 1 full meal a day.

22$Condition: Depression$7/17/2015 11:45:28 PM$Reviewer: pdiddle78, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$This medication combined with Cymbalta finally pulled me out of a terrible depression I had been suffering for almost 6 months.  The worst side effect was Weight Gain.  I literally gained 40lbs and NOTHING I did (diet, exercise) would drop the weight.  Fortunately, I've been able to come off of it and should enjoy shedding the weight over time.
23$Condition: Depression$6/17/2015 1:48:38 PM$Reviewer: Lawro, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$Originally started taking 15mg before ned for insomnia but was then made homeless which caused me to go into deep depression with bad anxiety so upped to 30mg then 45mg. This med helped keep me together. Highly effective at treating depression with big improvements within 3 days. Moderately effective at keeping anxiety at bay. After 6 months it still improves my sleep onset, duration and quality. No side effects noticed apart from extreme drowsiness first few days.
24$Condition: Depression$12/19/2014 6:13:06 PM$Reviewer: woofie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$My depression got better and I was able to sleep.  However, the weight gain and increased appetite was awful.  I know it depends on what you eat but I found I was craving sugar and junk food.  Prior to taking Mirtazpine I had no cravings.  I'm off of now.  Will the weight come off easily?
25$Condition: Depression$12/17/2014 8:41:11 PM$Reviewer: JB, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$5$"I started on Mirtazapine oral, over a year ago. At first I found it to be too sedating and almost stopped taking it. I am now on 30mg but very depressed and short tempered. I have never had problems with panic attacks, now they happen without warning. If anyone has had the same experience please let me know. I am considering to stop taking this useless medication because Its done nothing for me. My Dr. added Prestiq which I stopped as i was turning inot a hermit not bathing or shaving or even clean the house. The withdrawel symptoms were like small shock waves in my brain for at least a month. Now, was put on Abilify and cannot wait to stop taking it. I feel useless I have no energy and fell depressed. I want to mention one more thing about Mirtazaphine oral, yes, it can lead to weight gain. I have gained 40 lbs since I've been on this drug.

26$Condition: Depression$10/29/2014 8:24:11 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$2$First night I took it I fell asleep fast. When I woke up the next day, 12 hours later, I was in a very irritated mood. That continued all day along with extreme appetite increase. Almost completed first week. Vivid dreams, some good, most bad, I remember the dreams long after waking up, which is something I haven't done in my life prior to this. No change in depression symtoms. I have gained 10lbs, almost can't get a full feeling after eating. I'm afraid to go to sleep because of vividness and content of dreams. My mood is so irritated and short with people I don't like being around anyone including friends. This is the first time I have taken anything for depression. I have one more week til I see my doctor. I will be hoping to switch to another drug.

29$Condition: Depression$6/30/2014 4:48:56 AM$Reviewer: Olayoil, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$"Oh my! I have to be honest and say I only took this drug for a few days.  I stopped right away after I found myself not being able to sleep very well, waking from sleep or a nap with my heart pounding against my chest; being extremely short of breath. It gave me panic attacks, which only exacerbated my shortness of breath and heartbeat. I had read a great deal of the reviews on here, and thought Yay, I'm going to finally get some sleep.  Not so at all. I was terribly disappointed, and being short of breath with my heart pounding prevented me from going anywhere.  It was a chore to walk in my apartment without getting winded.  Forget going out to the store or pharmacy. 

While I don't think I am in the majority, this situation happens to me quite a bit. If a drug makes others sleep, it keeps me awake. I plan on asking my psychiatrist to put me back on Nortriptyline during the day, and Trazadone at night.  I'm disappointed, but cannot wait 1 - 4 weeks for this drug to take effect."

It was very good at treating my depression.  I didn't have any of the weight gain some people complain about, but it did make me crazy tired when I was working my way up to my therapeutic dose.  
Coming off of it has been a challenge.  Nausea, and some recurrence of my panic disorder.  My doctor had me do it really slowly; over several months- I can't imagine how crazy hard it would have been if I had done it faster.  "

Frequent urination causes sleep interruption at least 5-6x nitely, then it takes awhile before I can fall back to sleep. Diarrhea is frequent in the morning. Since taking these, I get out of breath just walking 4-5 steps; my bones have been aching, ESP during  the nite, and to the point of restless tossing and turning. I feel extremely weak, thinking I'm going to lose coordination. Climbing upstairs has become a burden.  Since on these meds (one month), I have no energy doing the simplest of tasks. Prior to this, I had lots of energy, almost to the point of being unstoppable.

48$Condition: Depression$4/28/2013 3:46:12 PM$Reviewer: Matt, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$5$I've been taking the 30mg tablets for maybe 8 months now and they do what they're supposed to. I found it took a week or two to start getting used to them. They help with sleep maybe too much. They force me to sleep about 8 hours even through a couple alarm clocks going off by my head for a couple hours. I've stopped taking them before because of this and was fine for a couple days but found the littlest thing would set me off so I started taking a half a night for a couple nights and back to the full 30mg. I've been off them again now for about a week and the first couple days weren't bad but I'm finding now that the daily thoughts of suicide are coming back so I think tonight I'll start taking them again. I strongly recommend not trying to take yourself off of these pills without your docs approval. He said it usually takes 9 months to cure depression but I think it may take a bit longer so be patient. Try getting to bed at least 8 hours before you're supposed to be up. They take maybe about a half hour to an hour to start working but make sure you don't have to do anything after you've taken them because they knock me right out cold. I've found that they do increase your appetite and you may gain a few pounds but chances are you'll lose it pretty fast after your treatment. Just being off of them for a week I've found that I'm not as hungry and probably have lost 2 or 3 pounds but losing the few pounds isn't worth taking the chance of worsening your depression. Hope this helps but please for the sake of yourself and the people in your life, don't stop taking them until your doctor thinks you're ready to.

When I started taking Mirtazapine  I did not  feel any  change  even though I still  occassionally smoke pot and drink alcohol. I have  been reading your comments but I have felt none of the  symptoms which you describe.  I still get anxious, shitty moods and I still find it difficult to sleep. Sometimes in the beginning, it made me tired but now it doesn’t. I don’t know if it is working or not. I still get anxious and feel down. Most of the time I don’t feel like doing anything except laying around watching T.V.
 Just the nerves from writing this makes me shaky.  I am 51 years old.

My first pill of 7 mg put me in zombie-like state for about 48hrs. Never take the full dose the first time, I'd suggest nibbling a corner and on a weekend when you can recover if its too strong. I couldn't drive or do even light work. 7 months later I'm now up to 30mg at bedtime and haven't slept like this in years! I take it at 8pm to fall asleep by 10 at the latest. Deep, undistrubed sleep and no grogginess next day. Sadly though, I'm begining to taper as I've gained about 40 pounds even though I've always been thin my entire life. I dream of food on this drug & keep eating even when I'm full! It did nothing for my depression so when addition of Wellbutrin did nothing I've finally found relief with 175mg of Effexor XR. I'm hoping now that the Effexor will cure my depression and the sleep issues I struggled with for so many years. Good luck to everyone out there. This is a trial and error process.

They would put me to sleep, but I couldn't stay asleep. My doctor  switched me to mirtazapine, thinking that it would help. While it has made me sleep the side effects have been miserable. The medicine puts you into such a deep sleep that your dreams are insanely vivid. I can't wake myself up from them, and I wake up most days so upset from the dreams. One day in particular I had my pillow in a headlock and was repeatedly punching it, all while in a deep sleep. It is a frustrating medication to be on. Not to mention I am a very healthy person, I eat mainly fruits, veggies and lean proteins. I also work out 3-5 times a week. I am now up to 135 pounds which is high for me. It is also very frustrating as I put a lot of effort into eating right and exercising. It is also not helpful for my depression. The continual weight gain is very aggravating and certainly does not help with self-esteem and depression issues. I requested at my last appointment being switched to something else, but my doctor told me that it can't make you gain weight, only increase your appetite. I think however, that the next time I go I will be insistent that we switch.

Sleep good, but the dreams are so disturbing that you think of them for days after having them and you also feel trapped while dreaming unable to wake up. Could tolerate the foggy head, but the bizarre dreams were too disturbing, they were awful and stayed with you after you were awake, just thinking how crazy the dream was. Went to Prozac, worked for me like a charm. No side effects at all and it seems to work very well for my  anxiety. Stay away from the other stuff, it's evil.

Side effects of severe headache and intense hunger disappeared on Day 7. However, at my first refill the pharmacy used a different manufacturer, TEVA. 11 days later I have stopped taking this drug altogether. My symptoms were consistent with my normal reactions to wheat and dairy. Called TEVA and they say it does not contain gluten, but it does contain lactose, which is derived from milk. HOWEVER, they do not use a gluten-free facility so cross-contamination could very easily occur. I do NOT have Celiacs disease, but I am gluten intolerant although I can consume gluten on occasion in small quantities. I had a severe gluten type reaction which included bloating (I went from slim and trim to looking 7 months pregnant in 5 days, with no weight gain; flu-like symptoms, chills and shivering (temps outside were 100 degrees, 80 inside), always felt like I had overeaten even when I had eaten nothing; sinuses stuffed up like I had a head cold, dry scratchy throat; general feeling of malaise. 56 hours after my last dose I am finally starting to feel ""normal"" again.

I'm not sure if my reaction was manufacturer-based, or if it was a build-up in my system of mirtazapine. I was taking 15mg once a day."

Pysch doctor downed my dose of Venlafaxine to 150mg and  put me on 15mg of Mirtazapine. This was to lessen weight gain and improve sex drive. Didnt do either for me and had to quit taking the drug because it was causing a sleep problem for me. My wife said that it was causing me to quit breathing like a sleep apenea problem and I would wake up feeling extremely tired. Also caused me to snore loudly, more than normal.

Since taking Mirtazapine for 2 weeks now, while I have gained back about 5 lbs., but am no longer angry, depressed, or have suicidal thoughts.

Medicine caused extreme vivid dreams and nightmares. I would wake up sleep walking and swatting at things in the air or talking in my sleep loud enough to wake myself up. Also extremely hyper sensitive to sounds, light and felt like I had sensory overload all the time. immediatly got off after I found myself sleep walking to the other side of my house only to wake up because I bumped into a chair. This medicine made me fell like a different person in a negative sense. Hard to wake up, did not get any rest when sleeping and started hallucinating. Felt like the side effects were worse than what the medicine was treating.

I was up-ed from 30mg to 45 mg and Im starting to get major mood swings, and crying spells, so I am slowly tapering off to 15mg (Ive never been on anything less then 30mg), to see if I get the same therapy effect without these side effects (weight gain, spacey, mood swings, etc..) I am not Bi-Polar, I am OCPD/GAD/OCD/Panic Disorder. As Im tapering off I seem to be getting better, even my anxiety has gone down. Im off Lamictal (horrible side effects and withdrawals.) So hopefully the 15 mg is the right thing for me. The doc says I have to be on a depression pill (I dont know why.) And of all the other pills Ive tried, Ive liked this one the best, so hopefully it will all work out.

Currently I take welbutrin 450/day for depression, concerta 36/day for adhd, luvox 150/day for ocd and trazidone 150/day for anxiety and sleep. Remiron was to replace the luvox and trazidone hoping to re-instate sex drive. Now using Remiron 15/day for 2 weeks. I usualy don't remember dreams. Some med adjustments caused interesting vivid dreams but these are nasty and i wake very uncomfortable. On the positive side, I felt too buzzed at first so the other meds slowly became reduced. Now taking welbutrin 150/day, concerta 18/day. I feel great!!! (Jury is still out on sex issues but i see improvment)  Maybe after 20 years i have the correct med. I'm hoping (with doc) to eliminate all but the remiron. Only God knows for shure so I'll keep the faith!!!  Good luck all and Don't Give Up!!

When I first started on them I was sick, stomach upset, and yelling angry but stuck with it and that has gone away (I was also on Clonazpine which may have caused some of that). The only side effects I have now are weight gain (which Im learning to control), no energy (but seemes to be getting better), and get irritated easily. Im also on Lorazepam to help sleep, for RLS, and also panic attacks. Im also bi-polar so Im starting to take Lacimtal. I hope this works, because Im sick of trying diff meds. My husband says hes glad to have me back, Im smiling and laughing more now then I have in a long time, and there are times when Im almost 100% again. However, I seem to be loosing the connection lately. Im going to stick with it though, because this is the best thats worked so far. It doesnt help that my job is by far the most stressed work environment Ive ever had to be in.

When they proposed this drug, I told my docs I feel like a guinea pig and was up for being a lab rat for another test to fail.  They told me this was the last choice anyway so I had nothing to lose.  Turns out I would have had everything to lose because Remeron has been a wonder drug for me.  8 years later, I'm still smiling and upbeat.  Loving every bit of this!  It even helped me quit smoking too!  And here's a little secret most docs don't know much about...often ADD can be masked within depression because they are so well coupled together.  Taking a med like Add-eral along with this this med has been the perfect combo for me! SO AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I WANT to get up in the mornings because there's stuff I WANT to do.  And the Adderal gives me the focus and energy to get it done.  It also helped me bring my weight down to the perfect size.

Cons: Lethargic throughout day, hard to get up in the AM, dry mouth, massively increased appetite, decrease in energy level. Probly too early to see how this affects my depression but right now I'm not happy feeling like a zombie all day and being hungry all the time. Will see the Dr. in a week.

I take it along with another antidepressant. I have constant anxiety from morning to night.  The first night i took it slept 16 hours.I felt very spacey and lethargic. I felt almost more deprssed but now am starting to feel great! My appetite has not changed, but when i do eat, i feel as though i can't stop-it's like having the munchies. I've gained a lot of weight. It has worked incredibly for my anxiety. I am much calmer and laid back.

I was flitting between extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts before, so great improvement. Side effects for me: No weight gain as yet but I'm being very cautious. No real change in appetite but I do crave sugar more than usual. The main problem is my skin and eyes - extremely dry and also I have more spots/pimples than usual. I can only put this down to the medication as normally my skin is quite good. But....i would rather be happy and a bit spotty than depressed..................!!!

I must say it doesn't affect my sex drive. I'm now on 60 MG. I've managed not to gain any weight so far because I'm on a constant vigil despite the mad increase in appetite. I stay hungry. I don't know how much longer I can go on without weight gain. I feel that inevitably I will succumb to a significant increase in weight. It's like having the munchies when I was self medicating. It’s a bummer because it works well for me for depression and against anxiety. I got off my previous depression medication because of the lack of sex drive. Now there’s no affect on sex drive but who wants the extra 25 to 30 lbs. It’s like someone mentioned in a previous review a trial and error (hit and miss) type proposition.

Started @ 15mg for two weeks then 30mg after. It was to treat depression associated w/ addiction. It causes me to sleep well about 30 mins after taking, w/ extremely lucid dreams. I have experienced constant thirst no matter how much I drink. Sometimes my heart feels like it will jump from my chest, not beating fast, just very hard. It has also caused my sex drive to drop significantly. If I miss my dose, it makes me feel like I am going crazy (for real), and I start to get very bad headaches until I take my dose. I am trying to taper off by lowering my dose to 15ms about 3 weeks ago. Will drop to 7.5mg this weekend.

Treating GAD and Depression, It does allow me to pretty much sleep thru the night. I do have vivid dreams. Have found that a glass of wine or two at night increase the dreams and morning grogginess. So I wouldn't recommend that.  I've been on it for 2 months, thinking about going without and see what happens.  I am taking it in conjunction with Effexor XL.  Note: My Dr. said increasing my dosage will not increase in grogginess.  So if your taking it as a sleep aid, try the lowest dose (1/2 of a 15mg). I know that sounds weird but I have found that sometimes increasing your dosage, like say Effexor, sometimes decreases your side effects. Hummm go figure.  Good Luck to All.

When I awoke I felt drugged...I mean really drowsy. That drowsiness made me feel MORE depressed. Last night I cut the pill in half and I still tossed and turned in my sleep. I also noticed yesterday that my legs felt like moving. I've been reading the reviews and I found one that described symptoms of RLS. That's what I have been feeling. I've been on Wellbutrin for three years and I used to take it with Prozac. I just hated the sexual side effects. But I have never experienced anything like this drug and I don't like it. My practitioner and therapist says to give at least a week to 10 days. I don't think I can. I don't feel right.

It worked good - too good.  I had trouble waking up in the morning and often slept through my alarm.  I started taking it earlier in the evening (around 7:00pm).  This worked great. Slept soundly.  Then I noticed I was gaining weight quickly. I gained 25 pounds in 3 months.  My appetite increased - I especially craved sweets.  I told my doctor that the weight gain made me even more depressed and I felt terrible.  My clothes wer too tight, nothing fit me anymore. I stopped taking it and right away, I could not sleep.  I was lucky if I got 3 hours of sleep a night.  I started to lose weight though - lost about 4 pounds but then had trouble sleeping.  My doctor put me on 7.5 milligrams per night.  I gained the 4 pounds back immediately.  I stopped taking it.  My doctor put me on Seroquel.  I'm going to try it but if it makes me eat more or gain weight, I will stop taking it.

My doctor and I are working to find out if it's specifically the medication or whether it's merely exacerbating an already existent condition.  Also tried to take it in the morning to balance out the drowsiness and it has helped a great deal.  I take my dose have a cup or two of coffee and I'm good to go.

Taken in addendum to Citalopram Hydorbromide(Celexa).  Total effects have not been noted thus far.  Taken for three months now.  Increased appetite, loss of any sexual ambition, outstanding sedation leading to some rather sound sleeping.  Also Prescribed Ropinirole for RLS and Tremor that was caused by either the Celexa or the Mirtrazapine.  Weight gain of about 5 pounds.  Curbing the hunger issues was much easier with fruit/vegetable juice combination and hydrating well.  I believe that this has done well to assist where Effexor could not.

I slept great, but soon to realize it was too good to be true. I had crazy dreams. I never seemed to be able to get out of the bed the next day and thats not an option when you have a one year old. And i would be extreemly moody in the morning if i didnt get like 12 hours of sleep. I've been on the medication for over 8 months and gained about 60 pounds and i am a very good dieter whos never ever been so heavy. exercising had become increasingly difficult being so drouzy and and lacking my natural energy. I deffinatley feel that there are health problems due to the weight gain and i am very unhappy with the overall drug. I stuck it out and gave it a try but i started to taper myself off of it and in 2 weeks i lost 10 pounds i have my energy back and i can enjoy getting up in the morning with my son. I smile alot more now that i am not so drouzy and so does my son and husband. I will just find another medication if i need to.

Taking 15mg b4 bed. Increased weight and appetite, can't be bothered with sex. If you can get around the drowsiness it appears to work best in improving mood when getting heaps of exercise, but seeing as exercise increases both catecholamine and serotonin release i'm totally sceptical about this drugs effectiveness. I'll check back in another few weeks when i've been on it for a bit longer.

No weight gain.

Not sure it has helped with depression or anxiety. Have noticed small weight gain. Basically I'm sleeping better but can't tell if it is helping my mental state.

But since the side affects, also directly affect me, I feel qualified to critique the med.  When the dr. put him on this drug, he completely lost interest in me.  Sexually and otherwise, and reduced our relationship to nothing more than a friendship.  How do I know it's the meds?  Because before Remeron, we had what others would call a ""normal"" sex life.  He's been on this med since late 2005.  Since that time, we've had sexual relations 3 times.  Yes, his depression and anxiety got better, but look at the cost.  Because of this, I see divorce in our future.  I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone, unless they're single and practicing abstinence."

171$Condition: Depression$7/7/2008 1:54:42 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have an undiagnosed stomach problem that left me unable to eat for months. Due to that, I became depressed and suicidal. The doctor suggested remeron at 45mg. It knocked me out ten minutes after I took it, but the next day, I was able to eat and I haven't had that stomach issue much since then. The only fly in the ointment is that the pill makes me ravenous now. I've gained like 50lbs since December (I was put on it in March of '07) and the doctor wants me to stop taking it. The bad thing there is that when I stop taking it, my mood goes downhill and my stomach starts acting up again. So it's either be fat and sane or skinny and suicidal. I think I'll keep my sanity. Thanks.

174$Condition: Depression$5/14/2008 4:09:56 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I was placed on this medication as an addition to another antidepressant because I was having trouble getting to sleep and remaining asleep.  It has helped me immensely, and I feel well rested when I wake up in the morning.  I have noticed that within 30 min of taking it I am pretty much asleep, so I really try to take it right before I go to bed.  This medication has really helped my overall mood as well.
