I cannot sleep now and somewhat constipated. Hot flashes kinda diminished  but not totally. I’m not as emotional either. But, I will stop taking because my sleep is much more important. I read that a certain mfg only made the kind for menopause issues. I wonder how you get that kind?

4$Condition: Other$5/23/2019 2:38:19 PM$Reviewer: Cic, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$This is the worst medicine ever. I took it for postpartum anxiety  and it turned my anxiety into severe depression which I have never experienced in my life. When I took it I became insomniac, suicidal ideation, feeling deep unworthiness, wanting to leave my family, could barely walk, heart palpitation, nausea, weak memory. At some point, I became so numb and I felt so aggressive which I have never felt before in my life. I took it for 2 months and a half. I was taking 10 mg at a time. Withdrawal symptoms: non stop crying for no reason and ideation. now I am on week 4 fsince I stopped it and the withdrawal symptoms are still horrible. The ideation disappeared but the uncontrollable crying spells, coughing, insomnia are still there. sometimes I really feel like I lost my mind. This is again the worst thing that ever happened to me in my life. It is poison.

7$Condition: Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction$1/10/2019 5:26:11 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I have panic attacks,fear of leaving my home, don’t like crowds, I cannot tell it has helped at all except I’m sleepy after taking it. 
8$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/16/2018 3:51:26 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$Works for GAD and SAD with depression. I take it at night, I couldn't tolerate it in the morning b/c it gave me more anxiety in the am but at night totally different. I take it with Remeron a good combo. Side effects extremely low libido, but last longer in bed. Remeron makes me tired, paxil doesn't. 40 mg paxil 30 mg Remeron. w/o these meds my anxiety is so extreme i couldn't do much, just going in a gas station was hard. no medicine will make me like before i got anxiety, but quality of life is improved to resemblance of normality. Also I tried Viibryd it worked for depression but not my anxiety enough. no sexual side effects on that stuff, i recommend it for depression only. getting on it was a pain just like any other i suppose, it's too expensive anyway and not good enough for anxiety imo.
9$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/29/2018 1:59:40 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on Paxil for more than 10 years after suffering episodes of anxiety/panic which would go on for months and leave me exhausted and depressed.  I started low (10mg) and felt results immediately.  I was able to sleep and stopped having fearful thoughts.  Eventually, I went to 5mg and stayed there for years.  It seems like it wouldn't work at this dosage, but my doctor recently put me on Zoloft to reduce risk of dizziness and I again started having high anxiety and sleeplessness.  Paxil seems to put a cap on the level of panic that my body can produce.  If you are experiencing a lot of side effects (I have few or none) see if your doctor will approve a lower dose.  This drug has given me great relief!

I had no emotions and very little interest in anything. It also made me nauseous, dizzy and drastically reduced my appetite. I had horrible brain fog and couldn't concentrate on my work. After this I was put on Zoloft which did nothing for me. I have been using exercise and meditation to treat my anxiety and it works much better then either of these drugs.
13$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/18/2017 2:34:10 AM$Reviewer: kikyo, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$3$Before I describe my experience, let it be known I plan on coming off this drug. I've been so sleepy while on it, it feels like that's what comes at the exchange of being socially active. Sure I don't worry as much as I used to, but I'm on 20mg and the effects stopped working as well as when they first settled at about 8 weeks in. It felt like my anxiety broke through the wall Paxil built and I've just been feeling low; still, not as low as I would have without it. I suspect increasing the dosage to work around its lack of effectivity  would cause me to be even more tired. When it is already required that I sleep 10-12 hours a night, avoid any exercise and go to bed exactly when I do. I hate living like I don't have any way around this. 
14$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/18/2017 6:03:08 PM$Reviewer: Tristan, 35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$3$3$I was on Paxil for 10 years. I recently switched meds because I felt the Paxil wasn't doing anything for me anymore. It did work for many years. I felt anxious and at times agitated. I still had panic attacks. I felt I need to switch and see if anything else will be a better fit. The brain zaps were horrible if missed or were late taking a dose.

I would have black-out episodes when drinking. I gained over 20 pounds and didn't feel like doing anything. Life became grey. I don't recommend this product especially because the side effects when you STOP taking it are worse than anything: nausea, confusion, auditory hallucinations, hot and cold flashes, bizarre dreams. 

Stay away from this drug."

I just recently got off the drug. At first this drug was a life saver but I was constantly sleepy and the deep yawns were very hard to deal with, I started to have jaw pain. I gained 20 lbs in that short time and that was my main reason for getting off this drug plus I had zero sex drive. All I wanted to do was sleep. 
19$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$4/23/2016 5:50:28 PM$Reviewer: Beaglemama, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$Never again. Paxil caused extreme irritability and mood swings. I was horrible to be around. I couldn't even stand myself. I've encountered 5 MD's that insist Paxil does not affect people this way. I've personally met over 20 people that say this is exactly the way Paxil affected them. I get so tired of the egos and narcissism of MD's. How many times does medicine, doctors, research, and pharmaceutical companies have to be proven wrong before they get it through their heads not all patients respond the same and the knowledge they have at the moment IS NOT the Alpha and Omega?
20$Condition: Depression$3/29/2016 9:50:15 AM$Reviewer: Mishey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I tried different anti-depressants for about a year and finally started taking Paxil. I function so much better on Paxil, I can live my life with out being worried all the time. This is the only anti-depressant that has worked for me with minimal side effects. I do not plan on stopping the medication ever unless i get pregnant, which will be hard to go with out it. It's been a life saver.. I'm thankful for this medication.

24$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/7/2015 11:21:31 AM$Reviewer: cheesecake, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$4$I have been on this drug for 9 weeks. Very satisfied with relief of anxiety and menopausal symptoms. I have not read any reviews about stomach upset, constipation, cramping, bloating. These are the worst side effects for me. In all the time I have been on it I have not had a normal BM. I live with cramping every day and many times go 2-3 days without a BM. My doc indicated it could take 6-8 weeks for my body get used to it. Still waiting. Also, in the reviews I have read I have yet to see anyone post about therapy. I would hope dr's would explain the need for therapy as well. Medication alone it not the answer. Luckily for me my husband is a therapist and without his help and support I don't feel I would be benefitting from the med. My dr had not suggested it but should be a part for effective treatment.
25$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/18/2015 2:09:52 AM$Reviewer: Chelle1986, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$5$4$"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2004. I became disabled as a result of the depression in 2008.

I tried several different medications and dosages before I finally settled with Paxil CR 2005. It works great for me. I take 25mg twice a day along with .5mg Klonipin twice a day. The combination of these two medications really have changed my life. 

The only drawback for me was it decreased my sex drive.  Also you definitely do not want to run out.  The withdraws are tough.

I no longer feel anxiety in social situations and virtually do not have panic attacks anymore. I am only taking 10 mg since my doctor just wanted to me to start off slow (I am very sensitive with reactions to any medication). I will be going back to my doctor to talk about maybe increasing my dosage to 20 mg. The only down side is I sometimes feel sleepy but doesn't always happen. Overall, I love this medication and it has really helped my life in a positive way.
28$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/15/2015 3:55:01 AM$Reviewer: PunkJesster, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$"10 yrs ago, I was hospitalized due to a ""mental breakdown"" (a mixture of multiple issues - various anxiety disorders, depression, hallucinations, OCD, PTSD) I was terrified of everything & everyone. I lost 115lbs in 3 months, my home, job and had to be cared for 24/7. I ended up being forced to take Paxil. It did not alleviate all of my symptoms - I did have to work at stabilizing - but it was just enough medication to ""take the edge off"". I have remained in 20mg these 10 years by my own choice. I find it has eased the severity of my panic attacks, has stopped the hallucinations, my depression is less severe and of a shorter duration than before. I am very happy with this product. I do have side effects, such as the random coughing - but nothing that outweighs the benefits of this medication. Missed dosages are very noticeable within 6 hours - headaches, pulses, anxiety rises dramatically but subdues rapidly after pill is taken again."

I feel noticably less anxious and irritable. The only downside is if you happen to run out.  Don't. The withdrawel is highly unpleasant to say the least. However,I feel the pros far outweigh the cons. I have tried Prozac, Zoloft, and Pristiq to name a few. I literally feel like a different person now. I have been taking 40 mg per day for 8 years and am grateful for the change. Also, watch out for Pristiq, it has extreme mood affects & can make you suicidal.

(Been on at least half a dozen in lifetime, 15 to 34) this drug made me so spacey and ""zoned out"" I actually got into a car accident while on it! No one was hurt but I remember feeling SO NUMB. You may not feel sad on Paxil but u also don't feel any joy or ANY other emotion, and say adios to ur sex life! also, this is THE WORST WITHDRAWALS IVE EVER HAD (and I've detoxed from methadone so that's saying a lot).

This medication has worked very well to minimize my depression.  I began taking 20 mg. 19 years ago.  For the first 2 weeks I was tired and a little bit dizzy but I started to feel less depressed.  After about 2 months on this medication I was feeling much better and my doctor recommended that I remain on the medication.  Over the years it has taken larger doses to keep my depression at bay and I am currently taking 60 mg. per day with good results.  I have tried to wean myself off the medication on two different occasions over the years.  Within 2 - 3 days after reducing my dosage my ability to ""think"" went downhill very fast and I felt very confused.  I resumed taking the medication immediately on both occasions and my cognitive functions returned to normal in 1-2 weeks.  I will not try to wean myself off the meds again and will probably be on them forever.  A very fair trade-off for the good quality of life that I and my family have had for the past 19 years. "

It also helps with my anxiety and PTSD. I had a dry mouth at first but that has stopped. I do not advise ever trying to go off this without talking to your doctor. I have gone from taking 60mg a day down to 20mg now as I want to be on the lowest dose possible that helps me. 20mg seems to be a good fit at this time in my life but I would go up if I needed to again. This medication has changed my life and it gave me the ability to deal with what I needed to in therapy also. I haven't had to be hospitalized for 10 years now and that is really a miracle.

During Paxil: good (feels like someone tickles your brain!)
Withdrawal: buzzing head, unable to stop crying, unable to sleep. (I drove to a quiet place in order to not wake up my neighbor, parked, cried a lot. Police noticed my car. Awkwardness ensued.) Listening to music/singing: did not help as much. Watching seasons of Lost / Grey's Anatomy, etc. helped a little - anything that distracts helps.) Talking it out with God: helped. Thanking God for blessings: helped. 

Haven't decided whether to stay on Paxil or switch to something else. If I could ensure that I would always have Paxil available, I would stay on it and when fixed, I'd quit by switching slowly to Prozac. Heard that this is a successful method for people who have trouble withdrawing."

Helped stop anxiety and depression and put me on the path back to normal lifestyle.  Down side of Paxil - the length of time it took to get off of them (1.5 years) reducing my intake.  Went off them for two days and had buzzing in my head, went back on then reduced dosage to get off.  Great you tube vids on this.   Wish I knew it was so addictive when I first took it, however, it was worth the work withdrawing as I never experienced further depression/anxiety since.

It has saved my life. I can sleep now; before I would wake up 3x a night. It began helping me in one week. And the results were obvious, like a weight lifted from my back. I have not experienced weight gain,  in fact I have lost my appetite. No sexual side effects. I feel more peaceful. I am not worried about the ""what if's"" in life  which I worried about constantly.  My situation at home has not changed but now I am better able to cope with it. It scares me to read all the horror stories of  withdrawal but for right now, I obviously need the relief I got form Paxil and will ask my doc for help when I don't need it any more. A little nausea and a headache for a few days is worth it to me to be able to sleep and stop worrying all day and night.  "

I have been taking 20 mg. Paxil for one year along with .5-1 mg Xanax daily.  The meds have been a lifesaver for me. I had gone thru a divorce ten years ago & my son has drug & legal issues. The one problem I have with Paxil is that I've become too apathetic. My doctor told me to take 10mg of Paxil and I've reduced the Xanax to .25mg.  My anxiety hasn't returned and am feeling less apathetic. We'll see, I like to stop taking these meds all together.

I have been taking Paxil for close to one year. Started with 20 mg, then bumped up to 40 mg.  I have taken many other meds with overwhelming side effects and little to no reduction in anxiety. Paxil is the only med I've taken that has reduced both my anxiety and depression.

I took Xanax (.25) PRN as I adjusted to Paxil, and I no longer need it.  I read a LOT prior to and while I was weaning onto it, and I was very nervous about side effects.  In an effort to deal with the ""sleepiness"" factory, I took it at night, and it made it much easier to fall and stay asleep.  Prior to Paxil, I was taking melatonin to assist with sleeping, but I would wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety that would keep me up.  I have had some reduction in libido, but that has minimized as my body adjusted to the drug.

Overall, I am thrilled with my results.  My quality of life has drastically improved.  I am now able to work on my anxiety in public situations without the massive panic or anxiety attacks that would lead me to avoid or leave early from social engagements.

My friends and significant other has noticed the difference, and I cannot imagine my life without it.   Remember, every one's body chemistry is different, and my results may not be your experience.  Don't give up on happiness!"

It pretty much made me numb. Not a ton of panic which was nice, but not a lot of other feelings either. I was breaking up with an ex and I felt and expressed no emotion even though I knew I should be sad. 
The absolute worst part of this is weaning off of the drug. I would miss doses from time to time and just be sick in withdrawal for a couple of days. Even when I was tapering it was hell. I wouldn't recommend this because of the difficulty of getting off of it."
63$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/31/2014 6:57:39 PM$Reviewer: Happy1978, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has changed my life. I spent me late high school years and college years self-medicating with recreational drugs and in a mental haze. I began Paxil when I was in college and felt immediate relief. The panic attacks abated and I could think clearly finally. I stopped taking Paxil in my mid-20's because I hated the shrink I was going to. HUGE mistake. Never stop this medication cold-turkey. It's hell. However, I again started taking it a few years later and have been on it ever since. I now have a career, a house, etc. and I don't think I would be here if not for this medication. I understand that is causes problems in some people, but for me it is truly miraculous. I previously suffered from depression, social anxiety disorder and panic attacks. All of which were severe. I am now a happy person with ambition and am completely comfortable. I will be on this for life. There is a biological serotonin deficiency that runs in my family and I am glad to have treatment that was unavailable to my ancestors (for lack of a better word). I understand that some of the side effects of this drug can be bad, but I credit it with saving my life. I am on a 30mg per day dosage. I tried to go down to 20, but it was not working. Back up to 30 and all good. Again, DO NOT stop taking Paxil cold turkey. You WILL get serotonin syndrome and it will NOT be fun. But as long as you keep up, you'll be fine. I can absolutely tell when I've forgotten to take a daily dose, but it's not as terrible as long-term withdraw.

For over a year I had been having a major depressive episode with extreme bouts of anxiety & agoraphobia. I initially started taking Paxil QD along with a benzo TID until it ""kicked in"" & I no longer needed the benzo. I went from basically living in one room (at a relative's house) to one morning (in August) I woke up, decided I wanted to be a nurse, went to where I graduated college, enrolled & registered for the term & started classes the next week. There is no way I can describe the change. From being terrified to go to the store & unable to go to a job interview to looking forward to going to classes & actually meeting & becoming friends with some classmates. Then I moved back into my own house, started dating, got engaged, graduated nursing school, got married, got a job (RN in the ER) & had two kids. I have had approximately 6 what I call ""breakdowns"" in my life. I have been on about every anti-depressant in the book. They seemed to occur every 2-4 years. It has been over 8 years now since I have been on Paxil with nothing close to a breakdown. I do things I never thought I could do (because of anxiety, social anxiety, depression, etc). I have premenstrual dysphoric disorder & it doesn't help at all with that (but that is not why I started taking it). Occasionally when under a great deal of external stressors I have small dips of depression or a bit of breakthrough anxiety. However nothing to the extent of before & it only lasts a few days at most. I am grateful for this medication, I had been hesitant to take it for years because of all the scary things I read about it online. None of that was true & minimal side effects for me. At first I was a bit more tired, that went away in a month. Just hoping this SSRI does not ""poop out"" on me the way Luvox did (my 2nd favorite depression/anxiety med). Last thing, overall it definitely has decreased my sex drive although not my satisfaction."

At each ckup I complained of major fatigue & still felt down + major weight gain but perhaps a smidgeon better.  My dr would just keep increasing dosages.

I had a friend taking Wellbutrin & it worked great for her.  Finally he agreed to let me switch. This is a HORRIBLE drug to get off of.  It took me forever.  I did it in very little baby steps.  Finally, I was on lowest dosage & could not lower it anymore without  problems.  I read that you can get this in a liquid form & I used a dropper and broke it down until I finally went off it completely.  I also lost like 30lbs.  I had brain zaps & major uneasiness.  Major Withdrawals!    Wellbutrin worked wonderful for me.  I actually had energy again.  However, it was very touchy tapering off of Paxil & starting Wellbutrin.  My dr tried to take me off it too quickly & I felt completely out of my mind with anxiety.  I drove my car home & refused to drive in it again until I could function properly.    I was so fearful of getting in an accident.  I do not recommend this drug!  I had tried  dif meds previously and I NEVER, EVER felt the horrible withdrawal symptoms like this!!

Have never had ANY side effects, other than weight gain (due to eating more, when I was depressed/anxious, I had no appetite).  Either due to ""SSRI poop-out"", or due to the generic formulation, I did notice diminishing effectiveness.  Raising the dosage by 10 mg increments, during times of stress, brought me back to normal.  I went as high as 60 mg, and find that the response is directly related to the dose, but there is always that 5 day lag (I have xanax 0.25 which I take as needed, for really acute episodes)."

I took it for over 10 years and gradually went off of it (6) months ago.  My life has been a living hell since going off.  The withdrawal is so very bad.  I began having frontal brain ""episodes"" which feel like terribly frightening seizures - adrenaline surges that can not be described.  This withdrawal has taken over my work/home/social life.  Utter anxiety / depression / panic and fear all of the time.  I spoke to a pharmacist / chemist who called my symptoms ""seratonin storm"" - he also told me that the way I described it as my brain suddenly being pumped full of adrenaline is a perfect description.  It is adrenaline. When it happens (with no warning at all) it feels like I have lost absolute total control of my thinking / body / brain and I go into a total panic.  This is a terrible drug.  Don't go on it.  The withdrawal is a hell I wouldn't wish on anyone.  It is not worth it at all.  Doctors don't know about this hell, they just don't.  They haven't been told about this, of course the drug companies wouldn't tell them about it.  They want to be ""the drug of choice.""
Once again - do not start this drug.  Don't do it - tell everyone about the hell of going off of Paxil - or Paroxatene CR."

It took a while to notice, but there was a general better mood that ensued on a middle level.  Some anxiety relief as well.  Side effects included near impossibility to ejaculate as well as lower sex drive altogether the first few weeks until my body adjusted.  Lack of actual emotions on the surface.  A general not caring.  I traded depression relief for apathy I suppose. They are serious when they say don't take on an empty stomach; finally got to find out what this heartburn sensation was that I'd been hearing so much about all my life.

Had the brain zaps for a week upon stopping the Paxil but not that bad.

Within 2 weeks I was 100% depression/anxiety free. At about 6 months I started waking up sick to my stomach every morning this would go away after taking Paxil. Spoke to my dr about it he didn't think it was related and he upped it to 20mg a day. 2 weeks later the same thing morning sickness. I went back to the dr he added klonopin and upped paxil to 30mg. Fast forward 18 months I quit going to work had lost all inhibitions, felt happier than ever but I just wanted to drink alcohol and sleep. Spoke with the Dr. he wanted to up the dose of Paxil, I got a 2nd opinion same thing they wanted to up the dose. I said no more, both doc's said I could quit cold turkey. Don't go cold turkey I could have died many times, falls, seizures and psychosis. Never experienced anything like it in my life. I failed quitting many times finally did a short tapper, became psychotic and immediately went into a mode of complete emotional flatness. 9 months latter I've made a 100% recovery but I made such a mess of my life on Paxil it's hard to deal with, so I have to take something temporarily for anxiety. I never even heard of someone having such a destructive reaction to a medication, and I can deal with the depression, for me I'll never take another SSRI. Probably had I stayed at 10mg, I would have been fine and the most negative side effects would have never happened. Just make sure your closely monitored while taking this one. Don't let your dr tell you it's not the medication and throw 6 new meds at you, I called bullshit on that but the damage was already done after 3 years. So I'm 37 and starting over. This drug has helped a lot of people, but it would be my last pick of SSRI's and then only if it's life threatening.

Word to the wise, though: I was 17 when first put on it and did not know it can cause suicidal thoughts in minors (which it did for me), so be aware of that.  Also, it has some NASTY withdrawal symptoms so be sure to take it as directed and always refill it on time!  AND I'm also bipolar, and being on just an anti-depressant can cause manic episodes!

144$Condition: Other$7/15/2012 4:22:57 PM$Reviewer: skeet, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) $3$1$5$My mom was put on Paxil about 8 years ago. She told me it was to help with her low blood sugar issues and help her sleep better. Side effects she has experienced include inattentiveness, digestive issues, urinary problems, coughing, bruising, and worst of all significant memory loss. She is now in assisted living because of her memory issues. Sadly, she has not been able to get oof of the drug because of terrible withdrawal symptoms - not sleeping at all, confusion, no desire to eat being the worst. The first time she went from 10mg/day to 5 mg/day for 2 weeks. Then 5 mg every other day for about a month, then she stopped. Due to the withdrawal, she went back to her original dose of 20mg. Since then I've learned that because of the way Paxil works, the every other day regimine should not be used. The second time she went from 20mg to 15mg for about 6 weeks. Then 15 mg to 10 for another 6 weeks or so. She did OK. But when she went from 10mg to 5 mg it was a repeat of the withdrawal she had the first time. The more searching I do the more I see how difficult it is for people to get off of Paxil. People considering taking Paxil really need to research the side effects (make sure you are seeing the complete list as I didn't know the coughing and bruising were sideaffects until this week) and the problems with withdrawal before making their decision. Consider whether the risks are worth it. My mom would say no.

This medicine has been a life saver.  It made me feel like myself again.  The only problem I have had is weight gain and trying to wean off of it.

My husband and I want to have a baby and I had to get off of the medicine before we could try to conceive. It took me 7 weeks to wean off 20mg...it was not easy...I cried a lot but I have pushed through with the help of my husband and a little xanax!

When I first started taking it, I found the experience somewhat difficult, always droggy and drugged feeling, dizziness and waking up with blurry vision. Then the sexual dysfunction. However, this drug has immensly helped with my Anxiety and depression and has completely changed me into a different person. Everybody can't believe how this medication has helped change my attitude for the better. This is a great drug, but some of the side effects can be diffult at first but may go away once your body becomes adjusted to it. I'm currently on 20mg.

They became much less frequent and less severe. However, the downside of this drug, which I was not warned about, is the withdrawal symptoms.

It has it's positives, like taking away anxiety,  nervousness, BUT, you must come to the realization that its got you and you will be in need of it for life.  At no point was I told by my Dr. in 1999 when I started taking it that I could have issues trying to stop.  I tried to ween off of it by slowly reducing slowly. Big mistake.  Head  zaps, dizzy, inability to concentrate, felt like a zombie.  So, if your thinking about taking Paxil, be ready to be its bitch for life.

At first it really worked.     Bad news - I gained 50 pounds on it even though I increased my activity rate.    After a few years, because of the extra weight and diminishing effectiveness, I was tried on other such meds but none worked like Paxil.    Several times I quit it to see how I'd fare without it, knowing depression can resolve on its own.   Off it, I'd lose about 35 pounds and feel ok for several months.   Unfortunately, all my symptoms came back and I had to go back on it to feel better every time.    Aside from dimished effectiveness over time, I experienced insomnia, inability to have orgasm (although arousal still happens), 50 pound weight gain the worst of it.

I recently had a bad panic attack and the doctor switched me to paxil. After about ten days I was back in the game and he plans to change up my meds every so often to avoid the tolerance effect. I will tell you this; once you start taking an SSRI, DO NOT stop taking it without the care of your doctor. I made that mistake about 5 years ago because ""I felt fine."" After I stopped, I didn't feel so fine. The doctor told me this is a lifetime commitment. After experiencing several panic attacks in my life, taking that litlle pink pill when I wake up in the morning doesn't seem so bad."

I eventually weaned myself off of it but decided to go back on it when I was expecting my second child, in 2002.  (PPD has a high recurrence rate.)  The drug has been a lifesaver and allowed me to function and get my anxiety under control, until just these past couple of months.  Maybe because I'm getting older and my body's going through changes, lately the Paxil has not been working as well.  I've noticed my mood take a nosedive the past couple of months.  I've been weepy and moody and my anxiety disorder has crept back to the point where I hate to go out unless I absolutely have to (shopping, meetings, taking kids back and forth to school, etc).  I'm going to schedule an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss what we can do to get me back to my old self...

Once you are on it and it becomes part of your regular routine, its with you for life.  I have taken Paxil since around 19-20 yrs old.  I used to have horrible panic attacks and anxiety that I found myself living like a hermit to stay away from people.  I couldn't stand to be near crowds or people I didn't know.  It made it a nightmare to finish college.  Once taking it, I was a new person.  NO panic, no anxiety, totally chilled out temper, I was very relaxed, not lethargic but comfortable in life.  HOWEVER< do NOT come off without medical help!!  
This year, my young children picked up a stomach flu from school and brought it home to share with all.  I was very sick.  Vomiting and diarrhea for 3 days.  I decided not to take my Paxil due to my extreme nausea from the virus.  BAD BAD MISTAKE.  I went bonkers!!  I had realistic, vivid nightmares, to the point of waking in sweats.  I had extreme insomnia then complete exhaustion.  A major detachment to life and those around me.  My temper was outrageous.  I snapped at anyone who looked in my direction.  Even my poor children for leaving the back door open!  I felt like death warmed over.  I actually left my house and walked 3 miles barefoot to get to a gas station because I wanted a Gatorade and nobody would drive me.  I had HORRIBLE vertigo to the point of my eyes crossing...
I'm a big guy 6'3 285lbs and have broken bones, torn achilles, had a truck run over my foot and broke it in two places!...etc and didn't cry.  Yet, I broke down boo-hooing like a child for NO REASON!!  This medicine is a life saver and or a life taker.  I'm back on it now and fine.  Living normally and happy.

It's scary and affecting all areas of my life. I'm having terrible uncontrolled anger (rage), irritability, unbelievable problems with temperature regulation,and short term memory issues.  Self control and inhibitions are negatively affected.  Earlier had week of nausea and loose stools - those symptoms have resolved.  I used Paxil for over 10 years for depression and migraine prevention, with small once daily dose.  This is my 2nd attempt to get off it - needed since my appetite was never satified while taking it.  I gained >50 pounds while taking - lost 10 pounds in first 2 weeks off it. I resent that no one ever told me about withdrawal issues, but now find this is a common problem.  I've been off it 1 month and still having significant symptoms - much worse than the depression it was used to treat. I feel trapped - coming off it is ruining my life but I can't continue taking it.

I was on this medication for 3 years and worked beautifully!  The only side effects were a decrease in my sex drive and if I forgot to take my pill I would get very dizzy, but once I took it the dizziness would go away.  Only downside - you can't just stop taking it.  You have to ween yourself off of it or you will have worse side effects (mine was headache and dizziness) so when I came off of it I started taking half of my pill every day, then I had my dr prescribing the 10mg and took only half of it every day until I was taking only 5 mg every other day.  At that point I was able to go off of it - but the process of coming off of it took months.  Overall it helped and if I needed to I would take it again.

The first few days of Paxil, i felt a little tired and hazy but also had a slight euphoric feeling.  After about 2 weeks my anxiety totally dissappeared! This was truly a lifesaver because i was having almost 10 attacks a day (mostly at night.)I couldnt even get a full breath before Paxil and now am breathing normally. The only negative side effect i can list is that my sex drive has gone down but I was on overdrive before Paxil so , in my case, I dont mind it .This medication also got rid of my daily headaches, and little aches and pains( probably associated with the depression.) I used to take ibuprofen everyday and now I might take it once or twice a month for an occasional headache.  I have heard of other people gaining weight on this drug but I actually lost 12 pounds since I have been on it.  I have noticed my appetite has slighly decreased. Overall, I would highly recommend this drug for panic /anxiety .  Also, my grandmother started using Paxil 10 years ago and is still on it and claims she cant live without it.

I still avoid situations thay I feel I cannot cope with, but the medication has caused the heavy chest pounding to totally stop. It seems to help me care less about a stressful situation, although in the beginning I noticed I wasn't as emotionally connected as I might have been, to events in my world. I tried Lexapro for three days and had to get off that ASAP! I cannot even describe the weirdness I felt with the Lexapro. I take only Paxil 15 mg and have gone days without taking it and have not noticed any trouble. Wish it would make me a happier and contenter person, but it definately helped the heavy, rapid heartbeat during anxiety.

The dry mouth is horrible, hard candy and water do not help, and now have dental problems because of it. Tried to switch to other SSRI's with my dr.s help but I didn't tolerate them and the side effects and depression from paxil withdraw put me back in the hospital. I only recommend this drug in extreme cases and only for a short term with counseling. They need to have a place specificly for those of us weaning of Paxil. The withdrawal symptoms are horrible and those quit paxil websites are to impersonal. Being around others going through the same thing would be more helpful. The psych hospitals now are mostly filled with junkies so group therapy isn't beneficial to us Paxil vets. By the way, since they increased my dose 10 years ago I have gained 75lbs. You have to exercise twice as much as the average person and that only keeps you from gaining weight not loosing it. The weight gain has done more harm to me depressionwise than the low seratonin did in the first place.

I have seen commercials and heard about horrible things regarding the use of Paxil and being pregnant, so I decided to go to my doctor and get off the drug. She advised me to just quit cold-turkey.

Flu-like symptoms, buzzing in my head and body, nausea, dizziness, shaking, insomnia, extreme irratability... The list goes on and on. I'm really scared I won't be able to quit.

It has worked for me for several years. I no longer have the anxiety and fear. I never took any meds for emotional illness before, and I put off taking any but finally trusted my doctor to try it. If you need medication then try this, but do not expect immediate cure because it can take up to 3-4 weeks to kick in. In reading some of the reviews I felt some did not give the meds enough time to improve their problems. If after a given time period, or very unusual symptoms never before experienced consult your doctor.

My dosage was 20mg/day. The drug seemed to really help balance me. Recently I decided it was time to see if I still needed the drug. I started on a gradual withdrawl. I reduced my medication - 1 pill every second day, then every third etc until eventually I was taking 1/2 a pill every third day. Everytime I changed the dosage I found I had side effects like dizziness, and lack of focus as well as crying at the drop of a hat. Finally I decided enough is enough and stopped taking the pills. It has been the worst 2 weeks. I have had every side effect listed and they do not seem to be getting any better. Although the drug was effective while I was taking it, I would not recommend it to anyone who does not plan on taking it for the rest of thier lives. The side effects are just not worth it!!!

I have very bad anxiety, severe panic attacks and moderate social anxiety disorder. I also have bipolar depression. I started on 10mg and got no result but then increased to 20mg and it worked wonders. I rarely ever had a panic attack and I noticed I was much much more calm. The only reason I give this 3 stars is because the side effects are HORRIBLE!! I am naturally a disorganized and lazy person and this drug pretty much took away any motivation I had. I use to be a slim 105lbs and while on this I jumped up to 130lb and stayed there. Also the withdrawl symptoms were the worst. If i missed even one dose I would get very dizzy, my brain would start ""zapping"" if that makes sense and I would feel physically sick and exhausted. When I stopped taking this medicine I was weened off slowly and still had very bad withdrawl symptoms. I would cry for no apparent reason and I ended up quitting my job because I was just so depressed during this time that I could barely get myself out of bed. I would recommend it if you simply have anxiety but I think you have to be very careful when taking this drug. I can understand why the suicide rate is higher than other SSRI's when coming off this medicine.  "

It was about 5 years before he was anywhere close to ""normal"". And here we are at 10+ years past this 1-2 day taking of these drugs and he still has effects from the damage done. If fighting the damage itself had not taken all our time, effort, energy, and taken our lives away from us, we would have sued the doc and the drug companies.

DXM's dissociative hallucinogenic effects are more noticeable so it can and may make you feel funny. there are other meds that may be potentiated by paroxetine.

alcohol + paxil = extrovert. but alcohol being a depressant, combining the two for me have been no comment. sometimes good, sometimes horrible. use caution. 

constipation. drowsiness. night sweats. stimulation of appetite. WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN. which is good if you're slim like me. insomnia, but not as bad as the other ssri's. lack of motivation. reduction on anxiety, brought on by paxil's relaxing effects.

this lack of motivation is why i cannot give it 5 stars for satisfaction. i LOVE THAT PAXIL is amazing for anxiety and it is almost a downer on it's own, but i wish it did this without making me less motivated.

sexual dysfunction. 

i take 40mg daily. generic paroxetine. manufactured by TEVA. this generic seems to have a pretty good bio-equivalence to brand name paxil GSK.

You are not supposed to quite cold turkey! Paxil gave me my life back and even if I do have problems when I decide to go off they would be nowhere near the hell I was in. Paxil delivered me from the most violent of emotions, severe panic, irritability, depression, fear, obsession, etc. The last seven years of my life have been wonderful and I owe it to this drug. If nothing else, it saved me from insanity or even death. I don't think my body could have handled what was happening to it for much longer. Yeah, I experience difficult side effects when i forget a dose but I can deal with it and if i ever do decide to go off i will do so be weaning myself off it over a period of months like it is supposed to be done. when it's done this way, it is much easier. ask yourself one question when considering paxil?, can anything be worse than what you're going through now. maybe, just maybe, it will do for you what it did for me. i wish you well.

I thought for certain that I was going crazy and would be committed to some sor of assylum. However, Paxil has been the best thing to happen to me. 

I was scared that medication would make me a different person, high or loopy. Instead, I am entirely my normal self and I have never felt high, indifferent or otherwise. 

The only downfall to the medication (and all other SSRI's I presume), at least for me (I know these meds effect everyone differently) is that you must wean on and off of them, otherwise there are some very uncomfortable physical side effects. I always stay ahead of my supply, in the off chance there may be a period of time where it will not be available to me. At that point, it would be beneficial to have enough to do the ""weaning"" until a time when I had regained access to my medication. "

I called the ambulance because I also have a heart proglem.  I was better by the time they came but had a terrible headache.  I have been a nurse for 30 yrs. and now believe it may have been a seizure.  Second I got sick waiting to go into a football game.  I can't explain it except that I was extremely weak, had a headache and just felt terrible.  I sat in our car at the game and the feeling lasted for several hours.  Third, I started to itch at work.  Then my mouth got so dry I couldn't talk.  I was doing an EKG and could not speak to my patient.  Then I got so tired and sleepy I had to go home.  I slept several hours and then was ok.

I am VERY emotional and I can cry again,I am very down on myself and I have GAINED 40+ pounds.Sleeping is my new hobby,its sad to admitt I would rather sleep than get dressed and function.I am pretty much pushing everyone away cause its just easier to do than it is to deal with the questions of are you ok or can I do something,that just makes me so frustrated and I hate this FEELING.If I miss a dose of my PAXIL I am DIZZY,cant concentrate ,and just CRANKY. I know I will be on some type of meds for depression the rest of my life so I cant just give up.This is like my 5th try of meds,and im going for a re-avaluation soon not sure if we will up the dose or change it but I have to keep on keeping on and so do you I pray no one has to be this relient on meds but unfortunatly there are many and I say to you,we are alive so lets live with what we have the best way we know how,with medicine and whatever helps us get a handdle on this AWFUL disorder.I also believe that all meds work differently on everyone so dont be discouraged by the effectivness of Paxil it took me a good 8-10 weeks to get it in my system and it was great for a while. Coming off this medicine is AWFUL DONT do it all at once.I missed 11 days once and it was BAD; DIZZY,DISORIENTED,ILL,BAD VISION, very UNSTABLE DECISIONS,and SKIPPED HEART BEATS,or FLUTTERS,so go thru your DR to stop this med and let him/her keep a check on you because it is SCARY!

I have no more panic attacks, am not nearly as emotionally unstable as I was ( I used to cry all the time, over everything!), and am not as angry.  This medication isn't for everyone, but if you have to rely on Xanax every day, you should see your doctor again.

I do not have any reason to withdraw from Paxil at this time, but I'm confident that I will not suffer any severe effects as long as I adhere to the recommended withdrawal procedures rather than quiting ""cold turkey"" as many of the obviously ill-informed reviewers have posted on this site. I've also used cognitive behavioral therapy in conjuntion with this medication and can report significant positive effects, improvement and overall well-being. "

Jan 2010 decided to wean off by taking 10mg once daily.  April 2010 reduced to 5mg once daily.  May 2010 stopped the Paxil.  Life seemed great until a family crisis, shortly almost lost our pet of eleven years and dear friend and neighbor died suddenly.  I had to start back on the Paxil 10mg and in two weeks increased to 20mg daily.  The anxiety brings on such a bad physical problems like tension around my chest on the left side and the tension around the heart is scary.  Guess once you’re diagnosed and placed on antidepressant's like Paxil it is a lifetime maintenance drug.  I had no side effects in going off the Paxil as stated by other reviewers.  But, I did wean myself off the Paxil very slowly over the next 4 to 5 months from 20 to 10 to 5mg.  Nobody should quit cold turkey.  As a male at age 55 to 60, I did find it annoying to loose libido and climaxing is very difficult while on Paxil.  This was part of the main driver to get off the Paxil was to enjoy what sex life is left for me.  If you have IBS problems this medication can really help.  The higher the dosage however can constipate you and makes bowel movements very harsh from bulking up.

Weight gain. Yes this is absolutely true. At first I gained about 10 pounds and I think this is common.
I got rid of the weight this year by running. Admittedly I run 5-6 miles 3-4 times a week but that did the trick. I would highly recommend if you go on paxil you start a regular schedule of running. Combined it is excellent!"

I suffer from a rather severe case of panic disorder that had practically become agoraphobia. (I refused to leave the house.) Paxil gives me the ability to separate obsessive and damaging thoughts from rational ones. I was taken off of Paxil and put on Prozac for a while, the Prozac made me feel CRAZY. Wellbutrin did nothing. After I was put back on Paxil, I felt like I was myself again. I have suffered some weight gain and I am thirsty more often than most people, but I have the ability to think clearly! I still have the occasional panic attack, but I understand what's happening and I'm able to think myself through it. Paxil is NOT for everyone, but it's definitely been the best fix for me. I hope to one day decrease my dose gradually and get off of it, but in due time.

In four years I've gained around 50 pounds. I've recently just stopped taking Paxil and did a body cleanse to help get the chemicals out of my body. For three weeks I was irritable, dizzy, itchy and developed a crazy rash around my neck and face. I thought I was going crazy and needed to be on Paxil. If this is life without Paxil then I guess I just need to be on it! I talked to my doctor and she never mentioned that those were the side effects of detoxing off of it. She just quickly filled my prescription again. Now that I know the side effects I'm going to quit. It is going to suck but I'm going to hang in there and stick it out. I don't want Paxil to run my life.

I started taking one every other day for about a month and then every 2 days for a couple of weeks and so on until I didn't need it.  A series of stressful events caused my anxiety to return and I resumed taking Paxil with no problems. My doctor indicated that Paxil should be taken in the morning. It is important to take it everyday to keep the levels in your body even. If I have to take it the rest of life, that would be ok with me.

My freshman year of college I developed severe Panic & Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and would have nightmarish panic attacks daily. I was in complete anguish, it felt like every moment of my life was an uncomfortable and unbearable minute that I just wanted to be over. I was first prescribed xanax, but as I needed to take xanax daily to help with my panic, my physician switched me to paxil combined with therapy.

I immediately noticed a difference - I began to feel  sane again! Despite my long use of xanax, it was no longer necessary on paxil. I was on Paxil for ten months, and about three months in was on a daily high dosage of 75mg. Although I felt sane and safe again, there were a couple side effects I noticed: ZERO and I mean ZERO sex drive; a somewhat Zombie like existence - I felt removed from any sort of strong emotion and would find my self often quite zonked out; occasional confusion, often a part of the ""zombie"" experience; either complete exhaustion or total insomnia; and, finally, a somewhat alarming weight loss. I was already thin - 5'6"" and 115lbs - and found myself, at one point, weighing a frightening 106lbs. I just never felt hungry, already had a slightly irregular schedule, and would literally finding myself just forgetting to eat.

However, the benefits outweighed the negatives in my opinion. I never thought I could be panic free. After 10 months I went off it cold turkey and had the most bizarre experiences (although, unlike most reviews, I didn't find it extremely unpleasant): I experienced tingling all over my body, vivid (but not frightening) dreams, extremely heightened sexual arousal, and a general feeling of weightlessness. I literally felt like I was being born again.

2 years after I went off Paxil, due to daily&emotional stresses, I began having panic attacks again. I have now been back on it for 1 month. I know it's a powerful drug, but I can honestly say Paxil has saved my life."

It could cost you your life and/or your sanity. My father took Paxil for 2 weeks and experienced realistic, vivid nightmares, extreme insomnia, exhaustion, and a detachment to life.  He eventually committed suicide!! In his remaining letter, he reiterated these symtoms, pointing mostly to extreme and intolerable exhaustion.  He wrote that his body hurt all over, most likely intensified from the sleep deprivation.  After reading numerous reports on this drug, many users report many of the same problems, with additions:  sinus, flu-like symtoms, feeling detached and numb, electric body zaps, loss of sex drive, terrifying nightmares, insomnia, confusion, exhaustion, and dizzyness.  Adding to that, many users have reported that separation from Paxil resulted in a torturous and terrifying withdrawal, with headaches, added dizzyness, worsened depression, and impulsiveness.  Please think hard before taking Paxil!!

It worked miracles for me, when I didn't think anything would help with my depression. Although my family refers to them as my crazy pills, I have to agree. A couple years ago I missed 5days of meds, out of laziness. Late in the 5th day i noticed numbing hands, and I went into a state of total confusion. I didn't know my children's, fiances, or dogs names. 10 seconds after taking meds I was fine. Very scary, though. Don't ever try to quit cold turkey. God only knows what would have happened if I was alone that day. Yesterday morning I woke up, took my meds with a sip of coffee then went out to sit and do my crossword puzzle. As I looked at my paper, nothing made sense(simple clues and words). I recognized that same confused state as when I experienced withdrawls. I couldn't remember what a pool was called,and I couldn't speak the names of my dogs, kids and fiance again. Noone was with me, so I just sat and kept trying my crossword puzzle over and over. finally, after about 15 mins. I was fine-even scarier this time because I hadn't missed any meds. I went to the doctor and was told it could have been a mini stroke-a side effect of Paxil. I am having an MRI and blood work today. Hopefully it isn't related to Paxil and it's nothing. Paxil has literally been a life-saver for me.

Within 2 days of taking Paxil it worked wonders.  My life changed for the better.  Although, I am now trying to wean off of Paxil due to a weight gain of 35 pounds and zero Libido.  My weaning process (day 7) has not been as traumatic as others have reported.  Maybe because my dosage is only 10 mg.  I have had a few symptoms such as extremely lethargy, dizziness, ringing in my ears, and crying bursts.  I am handling it.  I hope to be fully rid of Paxil for life.  Not because of its effectiveness because I felt very good on it but I am on other medications for other reasons (not anxiety) and don't believe in taking a lot of medications.  Eventually medications don't work well with each other, then they're black boxed for other reasons.  Sometimes it is a mess.  I am going through Menopause and truly believe that it is a cause for a lot of my medical problems including anxiety.  Since the start of perimenopause and now in full blown menopause I have been diagnosed with several problems medically and now PSS.  We will see, I might be back on Paxil for life.  It is what it is.  Do what makes you feel right and not what others tell you what to do.  Just be informed!  Try to enjoy life.

I have no sexual desire either. I have missed some doses due to not being able to get my prescription. THIS MEDICATION CAN CAUSE SEVERE WITHDRAWALS THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO DIE!! You expierience brain zaps, dizziness, muscle weakness, and nausea. i have tried to ween myself off of it and it has not worked. I am currently trying to find a different medication!! I feel as if the makers of Paxil, tell you how great this drug is and ohhh that there are a couple of side effects, but they do not really go into detail about the withdrawal symptons then once you get on the medication and try to get off of it you cant nor want to due to the withdrawals, so you are stuck taking it. TERRIBLE...

At first it worked great, but I have gained 40 pounds since being on Paxil. I don't and have never really eaten very much but the weight kept coming until I felt even worse than before taking it. I feel miserable after gaining all the weight but have just switched to Cymbalta. With Paxil, my sex drive went from wanting it every day to not caring if I ever have sex. I still had anxiety with Paxil and would take Xanax to combat that. I went to a new Psychiatrist a few days ago, and was told Paxil was the wrong drug for me, and she would very seldom prescribe it because of the side effects. I'm just hoping now I can feel better, lose weight, and enjoy sex again.

This medication has worked wonders for these conditions for me. HOWEVER, do not stop taking it suddenly after long term use. The effective way to discontinue usage is slowly with lowering of dosage supervised by your doctor. I experienced the extreme problems with my conditions when I ran out of the RX and had to wait 2 weeks to see a new Dr. (withdrawls, severe depression, uncontrolled crying, constant state of panic and anxiety). I take 60mg daily for several years now and am very happy with the results it has even after long term usage.

I thought 40 mg was the max and I was taking 30; changed doctors and he doubled it and added Saphris after a month and I feel much better.

The first time was about 20 years ago when we had multiple deaths in the family and I was having depression with anxiety.  My experience has been mixed.  Initially it seemed very effective in helping manage the depression and anxiety and I was not greatly concerned with any side effects.  Recently I went on Paxil again - my business has been greatly effected by the economic difficulties.  This time the side effects are a real problem.  In summary they include being constantly very tired, muscle weekness and major sleeping pattern disruption.  Some days it's near impossible to stay awake and I may sleep at night or be tired and not be able to fall asleep.  No sexual desire at all and a very low energy level.  I'm thinking I'll start weaning myself off the medication slowly.  I tried to go cold turkey and after a few days started getting the shakes.  From my reading I've gleaned that people may respond very differently to this medication and that even the same individual may have different reactions at different time.  I have pretty bad allergies and during allergy season the tiredness and weakness increases.

I have gone off it to try Lexapro and Effexor which made me more anxious.  FYI-I have not had bad experiences going off Paxil nor have I had the sexual side effects.    If anything it has made me enjoy sex more because I am less anxious.

It has been a wonder drug in terms of helping me with social anxiety.   It has been less effective in dealing with my  general anxiety disorder.   I still have been very anxious.

I started seeing a new medication MD and she suggested pulling the paxil dossage up to 30 mg.  I have started to take 30 but I am very tired and have adry mouth.  I have been at 30 mg for a about five days.  I am not sure if I will stay on it.

At 20 mg I did not notice any significant side effects.

In short I have found Paxil to be very helpful with social anxiety and feeling blue without major side effects.   It has not been as effective as some physicians would like for generalized anxiety disorder.

They trying me at 30 mg and right now I just feel very tired after taking it a few days-will give two more weeks to see how it works."

I'd gone through some major life-stressors and felt as if the Prozac wasn't doing its job anymore.  I started the 20 mg Paxil and felt a new ""mellow-ness"" start to settle in after a few days, which obviously was a nice change. I weighed 134.  However, after about 3 months, I noticed a huge, steady weight gain, though my eating and exercise habits had not changed.  I  began to feel very anxious and depressed about the way I looked due to the weight gain and asked my Dr. about it who basically told me I wasn't 21 anymore (I'm 31) and my metabolism had changed.  I thought, ""Bulls&^*"" and did a little research, only to find out that massive weight gain is actually very common.  I read over and over not to stop the drug cold-turkey b/c it can cause major withdrawl symptoms.  So I started out by half-ing my dose (down to 10 mg) for 10 days and didn't notice any change.  then I did another half (down to 5 mg) for another 10 days.  Then I started taking 5mg every other day.  After about 10 days of that, I started to LOSE it.  Major crying episodes, muscle aches, confusion, rage, memory lapses and just a general horrible feeling.  My husband noticed a big decline in my mental health and suggested I started taking it again, which I've refused b/c after 5 months on the drug, I have gained 39 lbs!!  Just typing that made me get flustered and cry.  It was totally counter-productive to ""fix"" my mental state but destroy my physical state.  It's a huge cycle and I am beyond frustrated.  I didn't gain this much weight through my entire pregnancy and I was on prozac throughout the pregnancy!  I now weigh 173 and am starting back on the 20mg Prozac but am not sure my mental health will recover until my physical health does - and losing 40lbs will obviously be a long process.  :("

(which in my case, is very hard with the hours I work.)  You will never want to take Paxil again when you get to experience the withdrawl symptoms.  I have never felt anything like it before, and I am not the only person who has had these withdrawl symptoms.  There are literally thousands who are against Paxil after going through the withdrawls.  I have stopped taking Paxil for ONLY 3 days now and I have extremely blurred vision, I cannot focus what so ever, I feel extremely angry, depressed, uncontrolled crying for no reason, can't sleep, extreme paranoia, dizzy, can't walk straight, just typing this is hard... I have to stop and think what I am even trying to get across, I forget things, I am slow.  DOCTORS SHOULD NOT GIVE THEIR PATIENTS PAROXETINE WITHOUT WARNING THEM OF THE WITHDRAWL SYMPTOMS!!!!   I would have never taken Paxil if I would have known I would have to experience this crap.  Paxil had done great for me up until now.... still not worth it, no matter how great it works.  I take Paxil for my anxiety.  It has helped wonders, but I would much rather deal with my anxiety then go through this hell. I highly highly recommend to anyone taking this, to slowly stop taking it.  Becoming THIS dependant on a drug is NOT good.  You can't take it forever, and when you stop you will see what I mean.

I started on 20mgs of Paxil and am currently on 40mgs. Seemed to help with my anxiety, but it seems only because it dulled me out. I'm very apathetic on this drug, have ZERO sex drive, which is affecting my relationship terribly. I have gained thirty pounds and even with eating better and excersising, the wieght just isn't coming off. I went four days without this drug and it was one of the most terrible things I have experienced. Extreme nausea, dry heaving, MIGRAINES FROM HELL, terrible dizziness, and disorientation. I've heard withdrawals of this drug be compared to HEROIN. Not skipping a dose like that again. I want to try to wean myself off of this stuff because I cannot stand the robotic, depressed, confused, and indecisive person I have become on it. I am extremely nervous to do so, however. I'm really starting to feel like a lost cause. To me, that doesn't sound like something that should be coming out of someone's mouth who is on anti-depressants. Just goes to show that it isn't helping. It's making me more depressed. Honestly, I think most of my anxiety control success has been from taking Xanax, not this.But I am scared as all hell what is going to happen to me if I come off this Paxil.

So he told me cut my pill in half and take 10mg for 7 days then jump up to my regular 20mg...but for some reason, I am scared to take it again..but a lot of these good reviews are turning me to the right way, of taking them again. I just want to be the other me I was about a year ago or so when I was happy all the time and I wasn't such a you know!! But I would reccommend it to people with panic attacks and anexity. Don't just jump off of it after being on it for about 6 months or so, because the side effects are not fun!

It somewhat helped with anxiety, but getting on it was a pain...constant yawning, and slept for about the 1st week..but I realized that I gained at least 50 pounds in that time...I just really didn't care what I ate..It really helped with mood swings, especially around that time of the month..but after thinking, I decided to ween myself off it..I was only on 20mg..so I cut myself down to 10 then none..I started the weening at the end of January.  My head is very cloudy, and I can't seem to get my thoughts straight in my head, also terrible nausea (all day, everyday) and diareha..my eyes feel shaky and dizzy, but not to the point that I can't drive or function.  I have pretty bad mood swings right now, but I noticed if I just remove myself from whatever situation, it'll pass and I'll calm down.  I'm just hoping this goes away soon...it is getting less and less, but I didn't think the withdrawals would be this bad..I thought getting on would have been tougher...Also, I have had no sex drive while on this pill..at all...I have also been going through a tough time sleeping and when I do I wake up in a full sweat!
333$Condition: Depression$2/15/2010 9:51:44 AM$Reviewer: Heather, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$I took this drug for a short while back in 2000 along with a whole list of other antidepressants and, at the time, I didn't notice any of them helping me at all. So I quit taking antidepressants and struggled for my life over the past 10 years. I've recently started taking Paroxetine (Paxil generic) again and in only 1 weeks time, I feel a great change. I'm feeling significantly better already! But I would warn people to be especially careful about having regular meals. Even though the instructions that come with the drug say that it can be taken with or without food, I have found that if I don't eat enough, the side effects are greatly exaggerated and I feel very nauseated, very faint, and even a little confused. These episodes can be very scary! I think it's best to take the medicine in the morning and have regular meals throughout the day, and a little food before you go to bed at night. Overall, I am very satisfied with the drug. It has given me some hope that I may still live a normal life. And I had completely given up hope. Hope this review helps!

It should not be taken unless it is absolutely the right drug and others failed. I strongly advise you to try something else first. It will treat depression but causes other health problems that are some more severe than the depression. The going through withdraw of this medication are severe and may put you in the hospital to get you off the drug. 
336$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/11/2010 10:37:50 AM$Reviewer: MichiganKid, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$3$This drug has some benifits and a some side-effects. It causes tiredness, and clumbsiness, it makes me irritable, anxious, and lose interest in complex activities such as schoolwork, however it does help me in other ways. I have a personality that is quiet and reserved. Paxil breaks this inhibition and exposes my inner thoughts as spoken words. In short, it makes me talkative, louder, gigglier(Laughing a lot), and I tend to engage in risks I would never have thought I'd do before taking this medication. It makes everything seem funny. I stopped taking it after having suicidal thoughts, and also when my college grades dramatically dropped from 3.5 to failing due to the lack of performing complex tasks.

I have also been on it while pregnant with one child and breastfed 2 children while on it. Both children are healthy and have suffered no ill effects from it(they are middle school age and younger).  I started taking it for depression/anxiety/panic and within 3 days I reported to my psychiatrist that the cloud had lifted. I went off it with my first child and struggled throughout the pregnancy so it was advised I stay on it through the next pregnancy. I have also tried to switch to other meds but have always gone back to Paxil.  The side effects of the withdrawal each time were always horrible. I have decided to just stay on it forever because I am happy on it. I had a lot of side effects when I started Paxil for the first several months to year but they were much better than crying constantly. I have struggled with depression/anxiety/panic all of my life.  I don't have any memory of not having it or not feeling it lurking.  The Paxil gave me my life.  BTW, I did have therapy in the beginning when I started the med. I think it helps the effectiveness ultimately.

I am leery of increasing dosage because I was on a seizure med. for another problem and went off which was bad, however it was hiding my other underlying panic disorder.

I plan on being on this forever unless something new comes along. Each person reacts differently to different drugs that's why you should not hesitate to be in contact with a Dr. you trust."

I was put on it about 8 years ago for anxiety and depression.  It worked great for me and got me out of the hole I was in.  However, if I missed any days I could really tell, i.e. the zaps and head swims others talked about.  I am now at a point in my life where my husband and I would like to have a baby.  I know that I need to ween off this drug, but am so scared about it.  I am mad too that I asked about Paxil and pregnancy when I got on it 8 years ago and was told not to worry about it.  I always knew I wanted to have children someday and wish that I had been put on another drug.  I went from Paxil CR to generic paxil and felt some of the head swims.  I am supposed to be cutting my dose in half, but am so nervous to do it.  Hopefully weening off slowly goes smooth and I can be off Paxil and get pregnant.  That all being said this drug has helped me out tremendosly and I would recommend it to those females who have already had children or do not plan to.

Side effects, however, have been since day 1.  Absolutely no interest in sex, want to sleep all of the time (even while driving or at work), constant yawning, as well as a lack of interest in food.  I know it's starting to kick in because the negative thoughts I was having I no longer have, and although I'm tired all of the time, I feel a greater consciousness coming over me, like I'm coming out of a fog.  I'm sure once the initial 8 weeks has elapsed, if not sooner, I'll be in fantastic shape.  Took at the beginning of 2000 and never noticed any of these things, but it definitely helped then.

By July 2008 I had lost everything we worked so hard to come by. I felt wonderfull on this drug and had not a care in the world. I left my family, lost my six figure job and had everything reposessed not to mention foreclosure. The reason? I was midiagnosed and actually suffer from Bi-Polar disorder. People who have this cannot take this drug alone if at all. Since I quit cold turkey, which by the way is not a good idea, I have never felt worse in my life. My depression is off the charts, I have lost intrest in anything I was ever interested in (including my kids)and have been within inches of hanging myself after researching the proper way to tie a noose. It has been hell since I quit the drug in Aug2008. I have never felt like even my old self and it is wrecking my household.

I can not say you will have the same results but make sure you are checked for bi-polar (manic depressive) before you start. Also it is wise not to like recreational drugs or alcohol, they will tell you that a little is ok but this is a bad mix no matter what, I havent been in so many fights since high school not to mention the total disregard for laws that keep everyone else safe i.e. finding your car on the lawn. I blame evrything on that drug thou I know they were my actions that resulted in my hardships, Paxil was the inhibitor. I just hope this may help someone although it is not a unique story, I have read stories alike. Make sure your primary care doc cares enough about you and not the med kick back. I had researched before I met with mine and ""asked my doctor"" like they say in the ads and she said my insurance would only cover two different options. I have Blue care network, they cover almost anything, those were just the only 2 she getting paid as much on. That is sometimes how it works. Biggest hint of all, she gave me samples first. I now live this way without seeking proper medical treatment due to my developed distrust of the medical field."

I took it successfull for 3 years.  I felt so much better within weeks of beginning the medication.  My doctor and I decided that after 3 years, I was well enough to do without it.  However, withdrawal is not easy!  You must do it very gradually.  I tried to quit cold turkey, and I can't begin to tell you how bad it was.  I felt like my brain was receiving an 'electrical jolt' every 10 minutes or so.  I was so dizzy when getting up from a chair or out of bed, that I had to resume the med for another few weeks and then try again.  This time, it was a very gradual withdrawal.  I took the Paxil for 7 days, then skipped a day, then for 6 days, and skipped a day, and so on.  When I was down to every 3 days, I took it that way for a few weeks, then every 2 days for a while, then every other day.  Gradually I began stretching the days without it, until finally I successfully weaned myself off it.  Today I am well, and I'm glad this drug was available for me.  However, for anyone trying to quit Paxil, do so very gradually.  Cold turkey is absolutely not an option!

Not sure if they are related.  Anyways - the withdrawal is killing me.  My doctor and my pharmacist - said there would be no withdrawal experiences -lied.

I am 33 and have been on paxil since 1998.  Paxil has kept me even emotionally. Recently I decided to quit paxil and try out something else.

She proceeded to tell me there were none.  TOTAL LIE.  The withdrawls are scary and I did not realize this until I started reading boards.  I have experienced severe dizziness, loss of balance, sweating, and severe heart skips that zaps my whole body. I feel all round weird.  I have been completely off for 10 days without any decrease in symptoms.  I was taken off cold turkey.  I voiced my concerns about reducing doses but was told that there are no side effects LIE.

No side effects what's so ever. Two years later while driving with my family to Ocean City Maryland, it started up again, this time with insomnia and could not stay asleep for more than an hour. When I returned I went right back on the 20 mg of Paroxetine and was right back to normal in a couple of days. I will take this med for the rest of my life.

Just a little advice, I gained a lot of weight also, probably about 50 lbs. Don't blame the drug, your eating more because you feel better. I went from 235 very muscular to 285 sloppy looking.

I'm still on paxil and now weigh 230 and feel like an 18 year old again. Also quit chewing tobacco two weeks ago after using for 25 years. Will not gain weight because I refuse to let it happen. Eat healthy and stay on Paxil if weight gain and slow sex drive are the only reasons for stopping. Your body will adjust, it might just take a little longer."

It was prescribed to me by the Physicians Assistant and as far as I’m concerned it was a horrible misdiagnosis. I stayed with it, as recommended, but it eventually turned on me to the point that even my neighbors could see the drastic shift in my behavior. From early on I felt like I was going to have a seizure. I experienced muscle spasms and violent dreams frequently waking myself up by kicking and sometimes even punching the headboard. I had very little motivation and no sex drive at all. Never mind Viagara, the problem was strictly behavior related. This time I talked to the doctor directly and he switched me to Wellbutrin and I noticed the positive effects in just 1 hour. If you have any of the symptoms I had don’t waste your time. Have the doctor try something else.

Then when I 1st tried to get off of it, the shock sensations really increased. It took several attempts and about a year to ween off of it. The shocks lasted for several years after that. I have been diagnosed with ""essential tremmors"" and I am convinced that the 8-10 years of Paxil use caused it. I say if you do take this drug to only take it short term."

Vertigo and balance problems are unbearable, let alone the shaking and breathing problems.  Unless you absolutly HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE do not take this med!  The side effect are not worth the benefits at all.  I wish I had never started it- needless to say I still have all my problems even though I am taking 20 mg a day.

   Her appetite has tripled and she gets hungry within an hour of eating a full meal. There's no way to control the hunger this med has caused her! Other side effects are dry mouth, tiredness and some short term memory loss that causes her to repeat herself sometimes. The memory loss is minor though as she has maintained her straight A average through her Senior yr.
 Paxil is an excellent drug for the problems she has but the side effects make it a detriment to her. She never suffered from Depression but she is getting really sad now because of the 30 lb weight gain from the Paxil:("

This time my psychiatric nurse manager continued to increase the med to 80mg/day.  Following that, I slowly developed neurological symptoms.  She & my social worker both suggested I see a neurologist.  The 4th neurologist I saw finally noted my dosage.  This was after 3 PT regimes, 2 brain cts, a mylogram & many other tests.  I had ended up in a walker falling when not in it.  I'm now recovering, usually able to only use a cane & able to regain my balance or catch myself before I fall.  I still have residual effects, such as tremors & balance issues.  I may also have an underlying neurological disorder (as yet undiagnosed).  Altho I'd always checked on meds when first prescribed, I'd not gone back to double check with the dosage increases.  I will now.

After 4 weeks-I felt subdued-not happy. I had hand tremors, nightmares-I would be screaming in my sleep-my husband had to wake me, couldnt focus my eyes at times, couldnt think, couldnt do simple things, like put on my watch, spell three. I had short term memory problems, I could speak to you now and in 10 seconds,not remember what was said. During the 5th week, I had an attitude change and became the bitch from  hell. I am a workaholic and love my job-I could have walked out with no problem. I wanted to say mean and nasty things. I am a medical asst-so I realized there was a problem and called my dr. He said we needed to stop the Paxil. Day 1 of stopping, I was so HAPPY. It was such a change and I loved it, alot of short term memory problems that day, but I thought it would pass. Day 2-all I wanted to do is cry, and I did. I couldnt think. So I go and see my dr-he says we have to wait for the Paxil to get out of my system, but gave me Xanax to help me get through.  I left his office, got the new meds and went home. I couldnt remember if I could take Xanax yet or had to wait. I called the dr I work for, he was aware of all of my issues. He told me that what I was going through were very extreme reactions and to take the Xanax, all would be ok. I took it while I was on the phone so I wouldnt forget. I am on day 4 of no Paxil, still taking xanax, still having side effects, but not as extreme, but I will get passed this. I never felt like I was going to physically hurt myself or others. Medicine is not an exact science, its individual. This is not a medication for me, but can be great for others. Your dr is very educated-but he cant predict what will or wont work. Just dont be afraid to call your dr and tell him what is happening. My family dr called me-not his staff-when I had this issue. If he ever wants to try another medication from this family of meds-I probably wont-but we will discuss it first.

There is a mild side effect: some loss of sexual desire. 
I have not had any of the scary effects people talk about here. A doctor told me it has no effect at all for 2 weeks so a lot of those you are reading are placebo anyhow.

I took it for about 2 years and weaned myself off of it. I felt fine for about 3 years and started having them again and could not stop them. I lost 40lbs in 2 months and could hardly leave my house, having several panic attacks a day. I was on Zoloft, which didn't make me feel better. Then I was put on Celexa and it was ok, but I started having panic attacks again after a couple months. I finally went to a psychiatrist and he put me back on Paxil.I have been taking it for about 1 month and I am going to up it to 37.5 (CR) in a couple days. I have to say, it has made me feel much better! It does make me sleepy and I have had some sexual side effects, but I would rather handle that than hardly being able to make it through the day. I was having panic attacks throughout the day, having a hard time driving anywhere, I felt scared all the time and didnt know what I was scared of, I had horrible obsessive thoughts (part of OCD), everything was negative, I was irritable, dizzy, sweating, and I could not turn my thinking off.  With therapy, meditation, medication, coping skills, and positive thinking skills, I am on my way to recovering from this horrible disorder.  Keep trying until you find something that works for you.

I don't know what else to do in the mean while, my patience is wearing thin. Let's hope the next few weeks fly by, and this is the right medication for his depression, anxiety and PTSD.

My doctor had me just starting out on 10 mg a day. It makes me really tired, so I have to take it at night. The first week I was on it I started noticing a change, and so did my husband. But now it almost seems as though it's wearing off or not working enough because, although I'm not as bad as I was previously, I'm still having some issues. I go back to my doctor in 2 weeks for her to do a check up and see how it's working. I guess I'll find out then if they'll have to switch me or up my dose or what they'll do.

I take the pink 20 mg pills.  I have gained weight and lost my interest in sex but I have never felt better.  My Panic attacks were so bad that I thought I would die everytime I had one.  I would even be so severe that people thought I was stroking.  Numbness, couldn't breath, dizzy and totally lost it.  i needed cold air to breath or I would go nuts.  i couldn't walk down shopping isles without getting dizzy.  Sometimes I would leave my shopping behind in the cart and run outside.  It was severe.  I wanted off.  I slowly weaned myself off and was pretty good for about 2 years until stress at work and potential loss of my job set me off again.  Terrible boss kept harrassing me!  I lost it.  Back on Paxil.  I carry Ativan with me where ever I go just in case I panic for some reason.  I get the odd moment when I peak and the regular doeses aren't enough to handle it.  God help you if you forget to take it.  Doctors say you can't feel it that quick but I know for a fact you can.  I am now up 40 lbs and want off.  I am going to wean myself and carry ativan where ever I go, just in case.  That's like a security blanket or back up plan...works in 10 minutes.  I can't say enough about how good I feel but just wish I felt like having sex or was my old thin self.  Here's to hoping.

I was prescribed Paxil for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I have now been on Paxil for about 5 weeks and I am doing fantastic! My dosing went as follows:

weeks 1-2 10 mg
weeks 2-4 20 mg
Week 5 30 mg

I started the 30mg yesterday and slept even better! I am almost anxiety free! I have lost a total of 11 pounds, my depression has lifted, and I no longer have morbid thoughts/daydreams.

The only side effects I have are my frequency in urination has changed (I pee more), drowsiness (I take paxil at 6pm everynight), and it's harder to achieve an orgasm, but with some creativity it still happens. My sex drive itself has not been affected at all.

Overall I give Paxil 5 stars. I LOVE Paxil. I have had such a great experience with Paxil. I am finished having children and do not plan on any more pregnancies (I have an IUD), so I plan to stay on Paxil as long as needed. Paxil has saved my sanity!"

I DO NOT really recommend this med. Yes it works to help Panic attacks and depression. But if you EVER wanna have kids or get pregnant and still take this med. Your baby WILL come out with problems. Check out youtube. Paxil babies. This is the reason I got off Paxil. I didnt wanna have a messed up baby. Also another thing. To get off this med is one hard thing to do. It took me 5 1/2 months to get off of. (tapering) I was shaking and it felt like my eyes and head was jolting. Bright lights hurt. I felt sick to my tummy and had weird heart beats. All the side effects are gone now. As for my panic attacks and depression. Its mind over matter. PERIOD. If your gonna think sick ur gonna be sick. Try using breathing exercises, keep calm and dont let things bother you. Think about happy things. Also if you have people in your life who bring you down then hey that may be your issue. I been off paxil since 2007 and feel great I no longer sleep 14-15 hours.

After a few days of feeling ""zombie like"" I talked to a nurse practitioner at work (I work in mental health)and she suggested I cut down to 10mg for the month until I see my doctor again.  This medication has changed my life! Within one week I started noticing a huge difference in the amount of anxiety attacks, irrational thoughts, and depression. Before starting this med, I was a monster. Always irritable, anxious, worrisome, and frankly, I was a total bitch! I yelled at my kids for no reason (and husband) and flew off the handle at the smallest thing! I had pervasive thoughts of morbid things happening to me or my kids, and always worried about their safety. My irrational thoughts and anxiety consumed me to the point I could not focus on my job or home life.

Since starting Paxil I have been so happy! Within 10 days my husband noticed a huge difference and told me he loves the new me! I am no longer anxious, grumpy, or depressed. I am finally sleeping for the first time in a long time.

The only side effects I have had are loss of appetite, which is welcomed because I need to lose, yawning, and it takes longer have an orgasm than it did before. It does make me very sleepy so I take it at bedtime (well after dinner, usually between 6 and 7 pm), and I notice I am still a little groggy the next day, but I will take a little grogginess any day over anxiety and depression. 

Overall I am very satisfied with Paxil. I KNOW the withdrawal side effects are pretty bad (I have been warned), but at this point in my life I am just trying to focus on daily events, my career, and my family. I don't think i'll be going off this med anytime soon, so I am not going to worry about withdrawal right now.

I am currently on 10mg of Paxil and not quiet sure if I will need 20mg! So far so good with the 10mg, and I feel better than I have in a LONG time. I feel like my old self again"

The highest dose I've taken has been 60 mg. and I am now down to 5 mg by choice.  I'm trying to stop it all together because I don't want to be dependent on a drug.  Although it does help to ease anxiety and depression, the withdrawl symptoms are pretty horrible. In the past, if I stopped taking the meds abruptly, I'd get really sick (dizziness, vomiting, stomach aches).  Therefore, I'm trying to ease my way off so that I don't experience these horrible symptoms.  While on the meds I gained about 30 lbs and have had bloody stool. I also have experienced a decrease in sexual interest.  Although decreasing my dose has brought back alot of the anxiety and depression, I am going to try some other alternatives to deal with these issues.  Long term use of this drug could be detrimental. If you are a woman and plan to one day get pregnant, then paxil may not be the med for you because it can cause birth defects.

I have been taking 30mg plus .5 mg of xanax for 4 years.  The only side effect is that I have gained 50lbs!  When I first started gaining the weight, I didn't care bc the benifits outweighed the weight gain but I am to a point now where I can no longer handle the weight.  So I have cut my dose in 1/2, it has been 6 days now and so far it isn't that bad.  I have the floaty head feeling on and off throughout the day but it only lasts a few secs and if I don't take the xanax I notice that I am mean and irritable.  But all in all I am very lucky to not be experiencing the bad effects that some are.  I have decided that at this point I am not going to try a new medication because at some point in the future I would like to have a baby so Im just going to stop meds altogether for now and see what happens.  This site helped me in that decision because I almost started taking Effexor, thanks to this I have decided against it.  Good luck to everyone, I will keep you posted.

I gained significant weight, felt sleepy all the time & took frequent naps, and it didn't help me feel that much better.  When I tapered off and finally stopped under my Dr's. supervision, I experienced miserable withdrawal symptoms anyway - feeling disconnected from myself, shaking, nausea, anxiety, i guess some would call it a full blown panic attack.  I'm happy for the people who are helped by it, but for me - never again.  And please don't stop taking this stuff abruptly.  The withdrawal is very scary.

I fought depression for many, many years.  I am happy to say that is now in the past.  I had side effects the first two weeks, but nothing after.  Does sometimes make me a bit sleepy, but I take it before bed.  I was told never to miss a dose, and that is good advice.  I missed once and it seemed to take awhile to build back up in my system, felt really down for a few days.  I know nothing of withdrawls.  My doc says I will most likely be taking Paxil for a long time, and I am okay with that!  Whatever keeps the mind numbing depression and anxiety away!

For about the first month I felt great! I think it was more that I wanted to believe it was working, not sure if it ACTUALLY was doing anything. Over the coarse of about 6 months I was bunped up to the max. dosage, 60mg. I can honestly say that it took the edge off of my depression but I was definatly still really depressed. It worked great for my anxiety! Alot less anxious and alot less axiety attacks. I just didn't think it was the right one for me since I was still having major depression and sucidal thoughts still. So my doctor weened me off of the Paxil and gave me a low dose of prozac to help with the withdrawls. Coming off was pretty bad. I had the chills with sweating, and almost like my head was ""floating"" and dizziness.It really freaked me out. But it has been about a week and a half now and I feel alot better. I'm trying a new antidepressant now and hope this one works better for my depression :)  I think the key is to stick with your RX until you fully know if it's going to work or not work. And don't get discouraged, because these meds do take time to work. Just have patience and your doctor will find the right one for you. Different meds work diffent for everybody. "

I spoke with my doctor and he said that can happen (rarely of course) and he put me on the ativan with it as well. I find eating right before I take it (at bedtime) is working the best for me. Being so young I was very scared and kept thinking I wasn't normal because I needed medicine. It is good to know other people go through the same thing. Good medicine, it really helped me live again.

Within a couple of months I was happy- didnt think negatively and was much more social.  About a year later I decided to try life without it- big mistake!  I gradually went off it with Dr.s instructions and didn't have any bad side effects and felt ok for about 2 months, but those old feelings of low self-esteem, feeling empty and not getting joy out of things came back.  I tried to live with it, but could not and went back on Paxil.  Again, within a couple of months I was my happy self.  I stayed on it for 3 and a half years & was so very happy just being me and living life.  In october 2007 I decided to wean off it (again no negative affects, very ease weaning)even though I was scared that I could return to the very sad empty me, I wanted to see if after 3 years i had retrained the way my mind works and also husband and I thinking of trying for baby (paxil linked to birth defects).  Was ok until about June 1-- stress of job change (career move) I think induced my anxiety and depression began.  I believe if I had been on Paxil during this career change I would have dealt with it ok since I changed jobs before while on it and was fi.  But I have again fallen into the deep pits and see no way out.  Went to Dr. to get prescription for anxiety/depression other than paxil in case I need to stay on med if I get pregnant.  Was prescribed Celexa and its only day 3 but I feel horrible- more anxious, not feeling happy yet (but again only day 3)cant get more than 5 hrs sleep, cant concentrate..and my new job starts in just a couple weeks!  I will hang in there with Celexa and try to take with sleeping pills, but if no improvement within the next few weeks will most likely go back to Paxil..even though that in itself makes me sad because BEFORE I fell back into this depression I so wanted to start a family soon with my wonderful husband, and I feel like I may have to take this wonderful happy pill the rest of my life...

598$Condition: Panic Disorder$6/20/2008 7:55:30 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$I take Paxil for panic attacks.  My dr has also prescribed Ativan in the mean time to help me relax until the Paxil is in my system.  I have been on this drug before and I did wonders!  But I made the mistake of stopping when I felt better.  I now know that I will have to be on this for life.  I have read all the reviews and I have seen many bad ones, but I know that without Paxil, my life would suck.  I wouldn't be able to leave my house or drive my car or anything.  So my advice is to try it if it is prescribed to you and go from there.  I would love to hear from other users, especially those doing an Ativan/Paxil combo.  Email me @ [email protected]      Thanks!

I didn't want to go anywhere, just the thought made me panic. After about 2 mo. I realized I was fine and the anxiety was slowly going out of my mind, I didn't even think about it before long. I started driving and shopping and felt great. The Down fall of Paxil is that there is a significant weight gain, a decreased sex drive, and effectiveness runs out after 5 yrs. I do recommend this drug for panic because when I was in a severe state of not leaving my home, Paxil made it possible.

I went on it originally because I was so scared I couldn't go to school.  It cured that and I have had no trouble going to work everyday (very very few panic attacks at work).  However, it also cured some underlying fears I've had all my life.  I used to be terified of animals, but now they don't scare me much at all.

As far as getting off, yeah, it's pretty awful and makes you unfunctional, but the way my psychiatrist made it sound, you could switch to another SSRI that is easier to get off of instead of trying to get off Paxil.  So anyone wanting to get off Paxil might want to discuss that with their Dr.

It also lost its efffectiveness after awhile and I began to have some depression symptoms returning.

I have had nothing but miserable side effects.  Dizziness, faintness, headaches.  Huge increase in blood pressure.  I mean it goes from my normal of 135/78 to 195/110 within 5 days of stopping medication.  I feel this can cause a lot of the unwanted side effects I have listed above.  I was told by my doctor that a SLIGHT increase of blood pressure is normal during withdrawl.  This does not seem slight.  I am still on the medication and fighting to lose weight.

I went up to the highest dose, which didn't agree with my body. I went on Effexor for depression. I'm still taking a small amount of Paxil (25mg) and 112.5 of Effexor.

I look at the glass half full rather than half empty. When I do go through a depressive state it's not near as bad as they used to be. I'm more fun to be around. I enjoy life more and smile more. It feels good to be alive. I have no more suicidal behaviors. I don't take as many quick risky behaviors as in I'll buy that! I take more time and am more rational. 
 
I don't have night sweats or hot flashes with menopause. My weight didn't vary much.  

Before Paxil, I was a different person than I am today. I take my medication religiously, because I found that when I run out, I suffer! I don't intentionally not take it, it would be insurance not wanting to pay. When I first began Paxil, I noticed my quality of life feeling better. It has gotten better with every year!"
658$Condition: Depression$1/10/2008 11:39:48 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$2$"I was started on 30mg of Paxil about a week ago. Within an hour of my first dose, I became dizzy, had a heaache, had no appetite (I only had one piece of toast all day), my food tasted like cardboard, evey bite of food made me want to throw up, I was nausous all weekend. But the wors part about it was that it made me want to crawl into a hole and die. I felt so much more depressed after I took it than I did before I took it.
I went to see my doctor about it the following Monday and she decreased my dose to 15mg. I still felt sick to my stomach, but my mood was ok. I decided to play with it and take it with dinner (on a full stomach)rather than at bed time like I was told to do. Now I feel fine.
If you have difficulty taking Paxil, play with the time you take it and have your doctor change your dose. That's what worked for me."

Initial inability to climax during intercourse (men and women) fades after several months. Only real problem is that quitting is REALLY hard.  I haven't had any psychological withdrawals, but the physical withdrawals were FAR more intense than the 'slight flu-like symptoms' described by the manufacterer.  My symptoms were more like serious sea-sickness or a bad hangover... inner ear seemed to be off in me and I felt the room spinning until I took some of the drug.
I took it initially in 1998 after a breakup and have been unable to kick it due to the  discomforting side effects.  Anyone have a solution?"

I had an extreme fear of public speaking and even of small group or one-on-one visits with people, as I was always worrying about panicking and feeling embarrassed.  I had extremely low self-esteem, and did not feel on an equal level with others, as I felt that there was something very wrong with me.  I certainly was not comfortable in my own skin, and it caused me feelings of depression and anxiety for years.  I would read self-help books having to do with coping with anxiety and discovering my true self, but nothing worked all that well, until I told my doctor about my anxiety and she suggested I try Paxil.  I got on it, and the drug has completely changed my life!  I no longer have any panic attacks; I have quit my dead-end job that I worked at for 15 years just because I thought I couldn't do anything else, and am now a sales representative with my own home-based business; I am a better mother to my four children; I no longer have a sick feeling in my stomach so much of the time like I used to have (in fact, I don't ever have that sick feeling at all anymore!).  The only drawback I may see to this is the fact that I have not experienced this self-confidence ever in my life before this, so sometimes I get a little carried away in social situations, and maybe say too much or act a little wilder than a lot of the other people.  I now do not worry about anything, and I have a general feeling that everything will be fine in life.  I have gone from one extreme to the other with dealing with stress, and I definitely like this extreme a lot better!

I have not had as many panic attacks and the ones I have had are not as severe.  Also, my depression has been more manageable.  Dealing with the daily things that cause me stress are easier to deal with as well.  When I first started taking it I had headaches and some pretty bad stomach aches as well but those are gone.  I'm dealing with dry mouth now but I'm fairly certain that it will go away after my body is completely adjusted to the drug.  This has been a God send to me.  I am so glad my doctor suggested it to me.  I had gotten to a point where I was once again contemplating suicide and could barely make it through the day.  I now am doing much better.  I'm a little nervous about what will happen if I decide not to take it down the road but will try not to worry about that until it comes up.

However, my liver functions were abnormal so I was taken off Prozac and put on Paxil as an alternative to help treat the depression and OCD. Paxil proved to be a viable subsitute but after about 6 years it's effectiveness has seemed to wear off.  I struggle with depression in spirts and especially during the colder months when the days are shorter.  I have not had any side effects to speak of with Paxil (paroxetine, i have been on the generic equivalent) but it seems to have pooped out. I am now beginning to slowly reduce my dosage in order to introduce Zoloft into my system. Hopefully this will work!

Paxil is the only drug that works for me. I have tried many others.  The only problem I have is decreased libido - it is a little better with the controlled release Paxil.  I am also prescribed klonopin for severe situations, which works quickly, but makes me very groggy and I have to sleep at least 8 EXTRA hours the next day....so not too convenient.  The only other noticeale side effect is weird dreams - this can be disturbing after a while and sometimes it's hard to remember if something was real or a dream.  I stop taking Paxil periodically - because I want my sex life back or I just forget to refill the RX, but I eventually have to start taking it again when the anxiety and/or depression get to be too much to handle.  I have not personally experienced any withdrawal issues, though I know others frequently do.

I do remember the first 2 weeks of taking it, my anxiety was MUCH worse, I couldn't sleep,and I would sweat profusely.  That was only 10mg!!  I would seriously think twice about ANY anti-depressant.  They all have terrible side/withdrawl side effects.  If you ever decide to quit the drug, it will take you months to ween off properly.  I quit cold turkey- NOT ADVISED!!

710$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/8/2007 6:38:52 PM$Reviewer: Leah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$5$I really liked Paxil.  It worked almost too well for me, especially initially.  Nothing bothered me, including the huge weight gain.  The withdrawal, for me, wasn't as bad as i was told it was going to be.  Also, once i was off, i lost the 30lbs i gained on this drug.  Overrall, worked very well but its almost a give in you will gain weight.

The drug helps others, so perhaps it didn't mix well with my body chemistry. After a year of trying different dosages, my doctor finally switched me to Zoloft -- and that drug gave me back my life.

However it is VERY DIFFICULT to get off the drug.  I urge anyone considering going on the drug to do some research on the web and discover the awful things that happen to people that are experiencing withdrawal from Paxil.

I have just given into the idea that I must take it for the rest of my life.
