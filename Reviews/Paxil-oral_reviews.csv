After three months I felt like my old self and was able to discontinue the medication. I have't neede it since.
In my opinion it was a life saver."

I function so much better on Paxil, I can live my life with out being worried all the time. This is the only anti-depressant that has worked for me with minimal side effects. I do not plan on stopping the medication ever unless i get pregnant, which will be hard to go with out it. It's been a life saver.. I'm thankful for this medication.
3$Condition: Depression$6/16/2015 4:07:05 AM$Reviewer: Clarisse, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$5$My life has and attitude have improved tremendously. I feel noticably less anxious and irritable. The only downside is if you happen to run out.  Don't. The withdrawel is highly unpleasant to say the least. However,I feel the pros far outweigh the cons. I have tried Prozac, Zoloft, and Pristiq to name a few. I literally feel like a different person now. I have been taking 40 mg per day for 8 years and am grateful for the change. Also, watch out for Pristiq, it has extreme mood affects & can make you suicidal.

5$Condition: Depression$1/21/2015 4:46:04 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$"I had been depressed on and off since my childhood. This medication has worked very well to minimize my depression.  I began taking 20 mg. 19 years ago.  For the first 2 weeks I was tired and a little bit dizzy but I started to feel less depressed.  After about 2 months on this medication I was feeling much better and my doctor recommended that I remain on the medication.  Over the years it has taken larger doses to keep my depression at bay and I am currently taking 60 mg. per day with good results.  I have tried to wean myself off the medication on two different occasions over the years.  Within 2 - 3 days after reducing my dosage my ability to ""think"" went downhill very fast and I felt very confused.  I resumed taking the medication immediately on both occasions and my cognitive functions returned to normal in 1-2 weeks.  I will not try to wean myself off the meds again and will probably be on them forever.  A very fair trade-off for the good quality of life that I and my family have had for the past 19 years. "

I don't cry as much as I used to but then I don't really feel anything any more. The word apathy doesn't even come close to describing how I feel. I have trained myself for so long to act 'normal' but that's all it is. I've told a few doctors that this is how every day is for me and they said the medication is working. Really?

11$Condition: Depression$7/14/2014 9:54:37 AM$Reviewer: wendingroad, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $1$2$3$I have been on this drug for almost 10 years. I have tried to withdraw two times with lower dosage, did not work. I didn't realize I had anymore pills and I have no money for a refill. Then I started to realize I was feeling like I did the other two times I tried to withdraw. I do have insurance. I am slightly light headed and I can cry at the drop of a hat. I found this drug not to be helpful. Some quack told me to take it as I was having problems at work. She didn't even listen to me and then just prescribed this drug. I don't even think it helped me at all. I still get sad, I wouldn't call it depressed. Will see how this works. I do get the sweats and I hope from what I read it doesn't not take 1 month. As soon as it gets bad I will get immediate help.
12$Condition: Depression$6/12/2014 1:29:17 PM$Reviewer: Jenn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$Paxil is the only medication that worked to lift my severe, recurrent depression. It also helps with my anxiety and PTSD. I had a dry mouth at first but that has stopped. I do not advise ever trying to go off this without talking to your doctor. I have gone from taking 60mg a day down to 20mg now as I want to be on the lowest dose possible that helps me. 20mg seems to be a good fit at this time in my life but I would go up if I needed to again. This medication has changed my life and it gave me the ability to deal with what I needed to in therapy also. I haven't had to be hospitalized for 10 years now and that is really a miracle. 
13$Condition: Depression$6/11/2014 10:14:58 PM$Reviewer: N/a, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$3$"Before Paxil: dread, extreme anxiety, unable to concentrate to the extent of walking away mid-conversation, crying episodes, sleep insomnia, constant desire to cut.
During Paxil: good (feels like someone tickles your brain!)
Withdrawal: buzzing head, unable to stop crying, unable to sleep. (I drove to a quiet place in order to not wake up my neighbor, parked, cried a lot. Police noticed my car. Awkwardness ensued.) Listening to music/singing: did not help as much. Watching seasons of Lost / Grey's Anatomy, etc. helped a little - anything that distracts helps.) Talking it out with God: helped. Thanking God for blessings: helped. 

Haven't decided whether to stay on Paxil or switch to something else. If I could ensure that I would always have Paxil available, I would stay on it and when fixed, I'd quit by switching slowly to Prozac. Heard that this is a successful method for people who have trouble withdrawing."
14$Condition: Depression$5/28/2014 1:03:25 AM$Reviewer: Linda J., 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Paxil worked great once it was in my system.  Helped stop anxiety and depression and put me on the path back to normal lifestyle.  Down side of Paxil - the length of time it took to get off of them (1.5 years) reducing my intake.  Went off them for two days and had buzzing in my head, went back on then reduced dosage to get off.  Great you tube vids on this.   Wish I knew it was so addictive when I first took it, however, it was worth the work withdrawing as I never experienced further depression/anxiety since.

I have tried several drugs before and none worked.  It has helped me sleep well and takes the edge off.  I am able to see the important things in life instead of stressing over minor items.  It has also helped with my PMS symptoms I have had.  I am a more mellow person with this drug. I am on 40 mg/day.  I have accidently stopped by forgetting to refill and the withdrawal is the worst! I do not recommend withdrawal- it hurts my brain, shock waves are felt thro my body every few minutes and I felt as if I were on edge and just a whole sense of sickness.(if that makes sense!)

Ive tried pretty much everything on the market for my conditions and id have to say this is a good all rounder. It dosent have too many side effects, it dosent cause weight gain and the only side effects I remember which were mildly shaking hands and legs stopped not long after first treatment. I think is had worked very well for me when my symptoms are mild and when ive been particularly distressed and something else such as a tranquallizer was added it worked well also. Ill never be 100% but of all the drugs ive tried ive always come back to this. I wouldn't say im always happy far from it but it does keep me stable at least

24$Condition: Depression$10/24/2013 12:03:04 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$3$My dr started me on lowest dosage.  At each ckup I complained of major fatigue & still felt down + major weight gain but perhaps a smidgeon better.  My dr would just keep increasing dosages.  I was so frustrated but agreed to increase as I felt so depressed, tired & hopeless.  I was up to 30 or 40mgs.  I asked my dr to switch me to wellbutrin many times previously & he did not want to.  I had a friend taking Wellbutrin & it worked great for her.  Finally he agreed to let me switch. This is a HORRIBLE drug to get off of.  It took me forever.  I did it in very little baby steps.  Finally, I was on lowest dosage & could not lower it anymore without  problems.  I read that you can get this in a liquid form & I used a dropper and broke it down until I finally went off it completely.  I also lost like 30lbs.  I had brain zaps & major uneasiness.  Major Withdrawals!    Wellbutrin worked wonderful for me.  I actually had energy again.  However, it was very touchy tapering off of Paxil & starting Wellbutrin.  My dr tried to take me off it too quickly & I felt completely out of my mind with anxiety.  I drove my car home & refused to drive in it again until I could function properly.    I was so fearful of getting in an accident.  I do not recommend this drug!  I had tried  dif meds previously and I NEVER, EVER felt the horrible withdrawal symptoms like this!!  Be very cautious.

31$Condition: Depression$5/28/2013 11:20:21 AM$Reviewer: Beckyboo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$Dr. put me on 20mg Paxil for depression instead of Lorezapam. After first dose I was sick all day, the day dose I was sick all day. Changed to taking it at night, was nauseated all the time, couldn't sleep and then started having trouble breathing. I had tried taking 10 mg. and still had the bad side effects.  When it started causing breathing problems I stopped taking it.  I have CHF, COPD, Diabetes and Neuropathy.  Something that I was taking for these illnesses must have interfered with Paxil.  I will not take Paxil again...

I decided (with my doctor's approval) to quite taking it because I began having trouble with erosion of my tooth enamel which I had read could be caused by Paxil and long term use.It also effected my weight and ability to lose unwanted pounds.Getting off of this drug was a horrible experience and felt like a narcotic withdrawl(what I would think it would be like).I had night sweats and terrible flares of temper over a 1 month reduction.I have been off of it for approx 5 months trying different medications but am going back on it becuase I did benefit from taking it to much more of an extent than I did from others I have tried."

Started on 20 mg, noticed results after 5 days.  Tried weaning off it, felt the withdrawal, and went back.  Have never had ANY side effects, other than weight gain (due to eating more, when I was depressed/anxious, I had no appetite).  Either due to ""SSRI poop-out"", or due to the generic formulation, I did notice diminishing effectiveness.  Raising the dosage by 10 mg increments, during times of stress, brought me back to normal.  I went as high as 60 mg, and find that the response is directly related to the dose, but there is always that 5 day lag (I have xanax 0.25 which I take as needed, for really acute episodes)."

It took a while to notice, but there was a general better mood that ensued on a middle level.  Some anxiety relief as well.  Side effects included near impossibility to ejaculate as well as lower sex drive altogether the first few weeks until my body adjusted.  Lack of actual emotions on the surface.  A general not caring.  I traded depression relief for apathy I suppose. They are serious when they say don't take on an empty stomach; finally got to find out what this heartburn sensation was that I'd been hearing so much about all my life.

Had the brain zaps for a week upon stopping the Paxil but not that bad.

Overall, I'm sort of torn on this drug.  Some positives and negatives.  Out of all the antidepressants I've been on this is one of the select few I would consider giving another try to."

Within 2 weeks I was 100% depression/anxiety free. At about 6 months I started waking up sick to my stomach every morning this would go away after taking Paxil. Spoke to my dr about it he didn't think it was related and he upped it to 20mg a day. 2 weeks later the same thing morning sickness. I went back to the dr he added klonopin and upped paxil to 30mg. Fast forward 18 months I quit going to work had lost all inhibitions, felt happier than ever but I just wanted to drink alcohol and sleep. Spoke with the Dr. he wanted to up the dose of Paxil, I got a 2nd opinion same thing they wanted to up the dose. I said no more, both doc's said I could quit cold turkey. Don't go cold turkey I could have died many times, falls, seizures and psychosis. Never experienced anything like it in my life. I failed quitting many times finally did a short tapper, became psychotic and immediately went into a mode of complete emotional flatness. 9 months latter I've made a 100% recovery but I made such a mess of my life on Paxil it's hard to deal with, so I have to take something temporarily for anxiety. I never even heard of someone having such a destructive reaction to a medication, and I can deal with the depression, for me I'll never take another SSRI. Probably had I stayed at 10mg, I would have been fine and the most negative side effects would have never happened. Just make sure your closely monitored while taking this one. Don't let your dr tell you it's not the medication and throw 6 new meds at you, I called bullshit on that but the damage was already done after 3 years. So I'm 37 and starting over. This drug has helped a lot of people, but it would be my last pick of SSRI's and then only if it's life threatening.

She put me on (Welburtran) sorry about the spelling. I just hope this serious side affect goes away when I start the new med. This has been horrible for me. Thank God my wife is understanding.

63$Condition: Depression$1/10/2012 5:56:44 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$3$5$I was started on Paxil for depression ten years ago as opposed to other depression SSRI's because Paxil has a calming effect also.    At first it really worked.     Bad news - I gained 50 pounds on it even though I increased my activity rate.    After a few years, because of the extra weight and diminishing effectiveness, I was tried on other such meds but none worked like Paxil.    Several times I quit it to see how I'd fare without it, knowing depression can resolve on its own.   Off it, I'd lose about 35 pounds and feel ok for several months.   Unfortunately, all my symptoms came back and I had to go back on it to feel better every time.    Aside from dimished effectiveness over time, I experienced insomnia, inability to have orgasm (although arousal still happens), 50 pound weight gain the worst of it.

I eventually weaned myself off of it but decided to go back on it when I was expecting my second child, in 2002.  (PPD has a high recurrence rate.)  The drug has been a lifesaver and allowed me to function and get my anxiety under control, until just these past couple of months.  Maybe because I'm getting older and my body's going through changes, lately the Paxil has not been working as well.  I've noticed my mood take a nosedive the past couple of months.  I've been weepy and moody and my anxiety disorder has crept back to the point where I hate to go out unless I absolutely have to (shopping, meetings, taking kids back and forth to school, etc).  I'm going to schedule an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss what we can do to get me back to my old self...

It's scary and affecting all areas of my life. I'm having terrible uncontrolled anger (rage), irritability, unbelievable problems with temperature regulation,and short term memory issues.  Self control and inhibitions are negatively affected.  Earlier had week of nausea and loose stools - those symptoms have resolved.  I used Paxil for over 10 years for depression and migraine prevention, with small once daily dose.  This is my 2nd attempt to get off it - needed since my appetite was never satified while taking it.  I gained >50 pounds while taking - lost 10 pounds in first 2 weeks off it. I resent that no one ever told me about withdrawal issues, but now find this is a common problem.  I've been off it 1 month and still having significant symptoms - much worse than the depression it was used to treat. I feel trapped - coming off it is ruining my life but I can't continue taking it.

The dry mouth is horrible, hard candy and water do not help, and now have dental problems because of it. Tried to switch to other SSRI's with my dr.s help but I didn't tolerate them and the side effects and depression from paxil withdraw put me back in the hospital. I only recommend this drug in extreme cases and only for a short term with counseling. They need to have a place specificly for those of us weaning of Paxil. The withdrawal symptoms are horrible and those quit paxil websites are to impersonal. Being around others going through the same thing would be more helpful. The psych hospitals now are mostly filled with junkies so group therapy isn't beneficial to us Paxil vets. By the way, since they increased my dose 10 years ago I have gained 75lbs. You have to exercise twice as much as the average person and that only keeps you from gaining weight not loosing it. The weight gain has done more harm to me depressionwise than the low seratonin did in the first place.

My dosage was 20mg/day. The drug seemed to really help balance me. Recently I decided it was time to see if I still needed the drug. I started on a gradual withdrawl. I reduced my medication - 1 pill every second day, then every third etc until eventually I was taking 1/2 a pill every third day. Everytime I changed the dosage I found I had side effects like dizziness, and lack of focus as well as crying at the drop of a hat. Finally I decided enough is enough and stopped taking the pills. It has been the worst 2 weeks. I have had every side effect listed and they do not seem to be getting any better. Although the drug was effective while I was taking it, I would not recommend it to anyone who does not plan on taking it for the rest of thier lives. The side effects are just not worth it!!!
79$Condition: Depression$2/25/2011 7:38:28 PM$Reviewer: dan86, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"i like paxil. it workes better for me than zoloft, about three fold actually. tolerability is higher than zoloft in my case, due to the lack of watery bowls, however, paxil interferes with a lot of other meds, specifically OTC. i don't recommend taking paxil and combining any of the following drugs: diphenhydramine (can give anxiety and akathesia, due to interaction from CYP2D6 even at low doses as 25-50mg, every dose of benadryl is doubled because cytochrome2D6 is inhibited by the paxil), dextromethorphan(DXM) for the same reason as diphenhyrdamine. DXM's dissociative hallucinogenic effects are more noticeable so it can and may make you feel funny. there are other meds that may be potentiated by paroxetine.

alcohol + paxil = extrovert. but alcohol being a depressant, combining the two for me have been no comment. sometimes good, sometimes horrible. use caution. 

constipation. drowsiness. night sweats. stimulation of appetite. WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN. which is good if you're slim like me. insomnia, but not as bad as the other ssri's. lack of motivation. reduction on anxiety, brought on by paxil's relaxing effects.

this lack of motivation is why i cannot give it 5 stars for satisfaction. i LOVE THAT PAXIL is amazing for anxiety and it is almost a downer on it's own, but i wish it did this without making me less motivated.

sexual dysfunction. 

i take 40mg daily. generic paroxetine. manufactured by TEVA. this generic seems to have a pretty good bio-equivalence to brand name paxil GSK.

During the time I was on it, I had three terrible episodes. First, I woke up from sleep and had a feeling I was going farther and farther away.  I thought it was a panic attack but it was different.  I called the ambulance because I also have a heart proglem.  I was better by the time they came but had a terrible headache.  I have been a nurse for 30 yrs. and now believe it may have been a seizure.  Second I got sick waiting to go into a football game.  I can't explain it except that I was extremely weak, had a headache and just felt terrible.  I sat in our car at the game and the feeling lasted for several hours.  Third, I started to itch at work.  Then my mouth got so dry I couldn't talk.  I was doing an EKG and could not speak to my patient.  Then I got so tired and sleepy I had to go home.  I slept several hours and then was ok.  My Dr. felt I may have been having episodes of serotonin syndrome. (Having too much) I would never take Paxil again.

It was great for the first year,and ok during the 2nd;but its less and less effectivness is now a problem.I feel like I am back where I started. I am VERY emotional and I can cry again,I am very down on myself and I have GAINED 40+ pounds.Sleeping is my new hobby,its sad to admitt I would rather sleep than get dressed and function.I am pretty much pushing everyone away cause its just easier to do than it is to deal with the questions of are you ok or can I do something,that just makes me so frustrated and I hate this FEELING.If I miss a dose of my PAXIL I am DIZZY,cant concentrate ,and just CRANKY. I know I will be on some type of meds for depression the rest of my life so I cant just give up.This is like my 5th try of meds,and im going for a re-avaluation soon not sure if we will up the dose or change it but I have to keep on keeping on and so do you I pray no one has to be this relient on meds but unfortunatly there are many and I say to you,we are alive so lets live with what we have the best way we know how,with medicine and whatever helps us get a handdle on this AWFUL disorder.I also believe that all meds work differently on everyone so dont be discouraged by the effectivness of Paxil it took me a good 8-10 weeks to get it in my system and it was great for a while. Coming off this medicine is AWFUL DONT do it all at once.I missed 11 days once and it was BAD; DIZZY,DISORIENTED,ILL,BAD VISION, very UNSTABLE DECISIONS,and SKIPPED HEART BEATS,or FLUTTERS,so go thru your DR to stop this med and let him/her keep a check on you because it is SCARY!

Weight gain. Yes this is absolutely true. At first I gained about 10 pounds and I think this is common.
I got rid of the weight this year by running. Admittedly I run 5-6 miles 3-4 times a week but that did the trick. I would highly recommend if you go on paxil you start a regular schedule of running. Combined it is excellent!"

He wrote that his body hurt all over, most likely intensified from the sleep deprivation.  After reading numerous reports on this drug, many users report many of the same problems, with additions:  sinus, flu-like symtoms, feeling detached and numb, electric body zaps, loss of sex drive, terrifying nightmares, insomnia, confusion, exhaustion, and dizzyness.  Adding to that, many users have reported that separation from Paxil resulted in a torturous and terrifying withdrawal, with headaches, added dizzyness, worsened depression, and impulsiveness.  Please think hard before taking Paxil!!
99$Condition: Depression$7/20/2010 12:45:34 PM$Reviewer: Mommy Dearest, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been taking Paxil for about 7 years. It worked miracles for me, when I didn't think anything would help with my depression. Although my family refers to them as my crazy pills, I have to agree. A couple years ago I missed 5days of meds, out of laziness. Late in the 5th day i noticed numbing hands, and I went into a state of total confusion. I didn't know my children's, fiances, or dogs names. 10 seconds after taking meds I was fine. Very scary, though. Don't ever try to quit cold turkey. God only knows what would have happened if I was alone that day. Yesterday morning I woke up, took my meds with a sip of coffee then went out to sit and do my crossword puzzle. As I looked at my paper, nothing made sense(simple clues and words). I recognized that same confused state as when I experienced withdrawls. I couldn't remember what a pool was called,and I couldn't speak the names of my dogs, kids and fiance again. Noone was with me, so I just sat and kept trying my crossword puzzle over and over. finally, after about 15 mins. I was fine-even scarier this time because I hadn't missed any meds. I went to the doctor and was told it could have been a mini stroke-a side effect of Paxil. I am having an MRI and blood work today. Hopefully it isn't related to Paxil and it's nothing. Paxil has literally been a life-saver for me.

I feel as if the makers of Paxil, tell you how great this drug is and ohhh that there are a couple of side effects, but they do not really go into detail about the withdrawal symptons then once you get on the medication and try to get off of it you cant nor want to due to the withdrawals, so you are stuck taking it.

At first it worked great, but I have gained 40 pounds since being on Paxil. I don't and have never really eaten very much but the weight kept coming until I felt even worse than before taking it. I feel miserable after gaining all the weight but have just switched to Cymbalta. With Paxil, my sex drive went from wanting it every day to not caring if I ever have sex. I still had anxiety with Paxil and would take Xanax to combat that. I went to a new Psychiatrist a few days ago, and was told Paxil was the wrong drug for me, and she would very seldom prescribe it because of the side effects. I'm just hoping now I can feel better, lose weight, and enjoy sex again.

Also helps change-of-life mild depression - that's when I started using it and with HRT, I felt completely normal again for years.  No side-affects at all.  Major depression started a few years ago and been on & off many anti-depressants but Paxil works best.  I thought 40 mg was the max and I was taking 30; changed doctors and he doubled it and added Saphris after a month and I feel much better.  I cried & slept all the time and since the change I feel lots better.  Get a good doctor and he can find the right ""mix"" for you.  Only been on this for 10 days, but I do feel better."

110$Condition: Depression$4/27/2010 8:18:06 PM$Reviewer: William, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$3$5$I've been on Paxil several times. The first time was about 20 years ago when we had multiple deaths in the family and I was having depression with anxiety.  My experience has been mixed.  Initially it seemed very effective in helping manage the depression and anxiety and I was not greatly concerned with any side effects.  Recently I went on Paxil again - my business has been greatly effected by the economic difficulties.  This time the side effects are a real problem.  In summary they include being constantly very tired, muscle weekness and major sleeping pattern disruption.  Some days it's near impossible to stay awake and I may sleep at night or be tired and not be able to fall asleep.  No sexual desire at all and a very low energy level.  I'm thinking I'll start weaning myself off the medication slowly.  I tried to go cold turkey and after a few days started getting the shakes.  From my reading I've gleaned that people may respond very differently to this medication and that even the same individual may have different reactions at different time.  I have pretty bad allergies and during allergy season the tiredness and weakness increases.

I'd gone through some major life-stressors and felt as if the Prozac wasn't doing its job anymore.  I started the 20 mg Paxil and felt a new ""mellow-ness"" start to settle in after a few days, which obviously was a nice change. I weighed 134.  However, after about 3 months, I noticed a huge, steady weight gain, though my eating and exercise habits had not changed.  I  began to feel very anxious and depressed about the way I looked due to the weight gain and asked my Dr. about it who basically told me I wasn't 21 anymore (I'm 31) and my metabolism had changed.  I thought, ""Bulls&^*"" and did a little research, only to find out that massive weight gain is actually very common.  I read over and over not to stop the drug cold-turkey b/c it can cause major withdrawl symptoms.  So I started out by half-ing my dose (down to 10 mg) for 10 days and didn't notice any change.  then I did another half (down to 5 mg) for another 10 days.  Then I started taking 5mg every other day.  After about 10 days of that, I started to LOSE it.  Major crying episodes, muscle aches, confusion, rage, memory lapses and just a general horrible feeling.  My husband noticed a big decline in my mental health and suggested I started taking it again, which I've refused b/c after 5 months on the drug, I have gained 39 lbs!!  Just typing that made me get flustered and cry.  It was totally counter-productive to ""fix"" my mental state but destroy my physical state.  It's a huge cycle and I am beyond frustrated.  I didn't gain this much weight through my entire pregnancy and I was on prozac throughout the pregnancy!  I now weigh 173 and am starting back on the 20mg Prozac but am not sure my mental health will recover until my physical health does - and losing 40lbs will obviously be a long process.  :("

So I quit taking antidepressants and struggled for my life over the past 10 years. I've recently started taking Paroxetine (Paxil generic) again and in only 1 weeks time, I feel a great change. I'm feeling significantly better already! But I would warn people to be especially careful about having regular meals. Even though the instructions that come with the drug say that it can be taken with or without food, I have found that if I don't eat enough, the side effects are greatly exaggerated and I feel very nauseated, very faint, and even a little confused. These episodes can be very scary! I think it's best to take the medicine in the morning and have regular meals throughout the day, and a little food before you go to bed at night. Overall, I am very satisfied with the drug. It has given me some hope that I may still live a normal life. And I had completely given up hope. Hope this review helps!

I have also been on it while pregnant with one child and breastfed 2 children while on it. Both children are healthy and have suffered no ill effects from it(they are middle school age and younger).  I started taking it for depression/anxiety/panic and within 3 days I reported to my psychiatrist that the cloud had lifted. I went off it with my first child and struggled throughout the pregnancy so it was advised I stay on it through the next pregnancy. I have also tried to switch to other meds but have always gone back to Paxil.  The side effects of the withdrawal each time were always horrible. I have decided to just stay on it forever because I am happy on it. I had a lot of side effects when I started Paxil for the first several months to year but they were much better than crying constantly. I have struggled with depression/anxiety/panic all of my life.  I don't have any memory of not having it or not feeling it lurking.  The Paxil gave me my life.  BTW, I did have therapy in the beginning when I started the med. I think it helps the effectiveness ultimately.

I was put on it about 8 years ago for anxiety and depression.  It worked great for me and got me out of the hole I was in.  However, if I missed any days I could really tell, i.e. the zaps and head swims others talked about.  I am now at a point in my life where my husband and I would like to have a baby.  I know that I need to ween off this drug, but am so scared about it.  I am mad too that I asked about Paxil and pregnancy when I got on it 8 years ago and was told not to worry about it.  I always knew I wanted to have children someday and wish that I had been put on another drug.  I went from Paxil CR to generic paxil and felt some of the head swims.  I am supposed to be cutting my dose in half, but am so nervous to do it.  Hopefully weening off slowly goes smooth and I can be off Paxil and get pregnant.  That all being said this drug has helped me out tremendosly and I would recommend it to those females who have already had children or do not plan to.

Side effects, however, have been since day 1.  Absolutely no interest in sex, want to sleep all of the time (even while driving or at work), constant yawning, as well as a lack of interest in food.  I know it's starting to kick in because the negative thoughts I was having I no longer have, and although I'm tired all of the time, I feel a greater consciousness coming over me, like I'm coming out of a fog.  I'm sure once the initial 8 weeks has elapsed, if not sooner, I'll be in fantastic shape.  Took at the beginning of 2000 and never noticed any of these things, but it definitely helped then.

By July 2008 I had lost everything we worked so hard to come by. I felt wonderfull on this drug and had not a care in the world. I left my family, lost my six figure job and had everything reposessed not to mention foreclosure. The reason? I was midiagnosed and actually suffer from Bi-Polar disorder. People who have this cannot take this drug alone if at all. Since I quit cold turkey, which by the way is not a good idea, I have never felt worse in my life. My depression is off the charts, I have lost intrest in anything I was ever interested in (including my kids)and have been within inches of hanging myself after researching the proper way to tie a noose. It has been hell since I quit the drug in Aug2008. I have never felt like even my old self and it is wrecking my household.

I can not say you will have the same results but make sure you are checked for bi-polar (manic depressive) before you start. Also it is wise not to like recreational drugs or alcohol, they will tell you that a little is ok but this is a bad mix no matter what, I havent been in so many fights since high school not to mention the total disregard for laws that keep everyone else safe i.e. finding your car on the lawn. I blame evrything on that drug thou I know they were my actions that resulted in my hardships, Paxil was the inhibitor. I just hope this may help someone although it is not a unique story, I have read stories alike. Make sure your primary care doc cares enough about you and not the med kick back. I had researched before I met with mine and ""asked my doctor"" like they say in the ads and she said my insurance would only cover two different options. I have Blue care network, they cover almost anything, those were just the only 2 she getting paid as much on. That is sometimes how it works. Biggest hint of all, she gave me samples first. I now live this way without seeking proper medical treatment due to my developed distrust of the medical field."

I took it successfull for 3 years.  I felt so much better within weeks of beginning the medication.  My doctor and I decided that after 3 years, I was well enough to do without it.  However, withdrawal is not easy!  You must do it very gradually.  I tried to quit cold turkey, and I can't begin to tell you how bad it was.  I felt like my brain was receiving an 'electrical jolt' every 10 minutes or so.  I was so dizzy when getting up from a chair or out of bed, that I had to resume the med for another few weeks and then try again.  This time, it was a very gradual withdrawal.  I took the Paxil for 7 days, then skipped a day, then for 6 days, and skipped a day, and so on.  When I was down to every 3 days, I took it that way for a few weeks, then every 2 days for a while, then every other day.  Gradually I began stretching the days without it, until finally I successfully weaned myself off it.  Today I am well, and I'm glad this drug was available for me.  However, for anyone trying to quit Paxil, do so very gradually.  Cold turkey is absolutely not an option!

I tried a variety of meds for my anxiety and depression.  Paxil seemed one answer that worked. Recently have to change because I am just exhausted and my doctor said Paxil causes a lot of fatigue.  (Wish I knew sooner I've been sleeping my life away for years.)  I had also low sex drive (really nonexistent). Now, under my doctor's advice I am switching cold turkey from Paxil to prozac.  I am suffering what I call 'head swims'.  You all seem to refer to it as dizziness.  I think it is worse.  I just move my head and I get zapped in my brain, feeling like a wave of 'something' moves around in my brain.  Also started bleeding as if I am on my period - which I just had recently.  Not sure if they are related.  Anyways - the withdrawal is killing me.  My doctor and my pharmacist - said there would be no withdrawal experiences -lied.  I knew it might happen because if I missed Paxil for a day or two my 'head swims' would begin.  I was on 30 mg of Paxil and am trying to go to 15 mg of Prozac.  When do the head swims end?

I am 33 and have been on paxil since 1998.  Paxil has kept me even emotionally. Recently I decided to quit paxil and try out something else. The main factor in the switch is that I basically have had NO sex drive for years.  I was worried about the withdrawl side effects so i asked my doctor about them. She proceeded to tell me there were none.  TOTAL LIE.  The withdrawls are scary and I did not realize this until I started reading boards.  I have experienced severe dizziness, loss of balance, sweating, and severe heart skips that zaps my whole body. I feel all round weird.  I have been completely off for 10 days without any decrease in symptoms.  I was taken off cold turkey.  I voiced my concerns about reducing doses but was told that there are no side effects LIE. BE CAREFUL and slowly ween off Paxil.  By the way my sexual desire has returned and has saved my relationship!!!"

I was curled up in a ball in my house and couldn't move. It worked for a good few years and then it didn't. Just stopped. I also noticed then that I was having the ""shock"" sensations. Then when I 1st tried to get off of it, the shock sensations really increased. It took several attempts and about a year to ween off of it. The shocks lasted for several years after that. I have been diagnosed with ""essential tremmors"" and I am convinced that the 8-10 years of Paxil use caused it. I say if you do take this drug to only take it short term."

There is a mild side effect: some loss of sexual desire. 
I have not had any of the scary effects people talk about here. A doctor told me it has no effect at all for 2 weeks so a lot of those you are reading are placebo anyhow.

The highest dose I've taken has been 60 mg. and I am now down to 5 mg by choice.  I'm trying to stop it all together because I don't want to be dependent on a drug.  Although it does help to ease anxiety and depression, the withdrawl symptoms are pretty horrible. In the past, if I stopped taking the meds abruptly, I'd get really sick (dizziness, vomiting, stomach aches).  Therefore, I'm trying to ease my way off so that I don't experience these horrible symptoms.  While on the meds I gained about 30 lbs and have had bloody stool. I also have experienced a decrease in sexual interest.  Although decreasing my dose has brought back alot of the anxiety and depression, I am going to try some other alternatives to deal with these issues.  Long term use of this drug could be detrimental. If you are a woman and plan to one day get pregnant, then paxil may not be the med for you because it can cause birth defects.

The second time I began to lose control of my drinking and I began feeling the need to take more pills than I was supposed to.  I lost weight, down to the point where people were worried about me.  When I decided I needed to quit taking it, I had awful withdrawal symptoms.  I felt like I was being shocked every few minutes, I couldn't yawn and I was a nervous wreck.  I will never take this stuff again!

I gained significant weight, felt sleepy all the time & took frequent naps, and it didn't help me feel that much better.  When I tapered off and finally stopped under my Dr's. supervision, I experienced miserable withdrawal symptoms anyway - feeling disconnected from myself, shaking, nausea, anxiety, i guess some would call it a full blown panic attack.  I'm happy for the people who are helped by it, but for me - never again.  And please don't stop taking this stuff abruptly.  The withdrawal is very scary.

I fought depression for many, many years.  I am happy to say that is now in the past.  I had side effects the first two weeks, but nothing after.  Does sometimes make me a bit sleepy, but I take it before bed.  I was told never to miss a dose, and that is good advice.  I missed once and it seemed to take awhile to build back up in my system, felt really down for a few days.  I know nothing of withdrawls.  My doc says I will most likely be taking Paxil for a long time, and I am okay with that!  Whatever keeps the mind numbing depression and anxiety away!

For about the first month I felt great! I think it was more that I wanted to believe it was working, not sure if it ACTUALLY was doing anything. Over the coarse of about 6 months I was bunped up to the max. dosage, 60mg. I can honestly say that it took the edge off of my depression but I was definatly still really depressed. It worked great for my anxiety! Alot less anxious and alot less axiety attacks. I just didn't think it was the right one for me since I was still having major depression and sucidal thoughts still. So my doctor weened me off of the Paxil and gave me a low dose of prozac to help with the withdrawls. Coming off was pretty bad. I had the chills with sweating, and almost like my head was ""floating"" and dizziness.It really freaked me out. But it has been about a week and a half now and I feel alot better. I'm trying a new antidepressant now and hope this one works better for my depression :)  I think the key is to stick with your RX until you fully know if it's going to work or not work. And don't get discouraged, because these meds do take time to work. Just have patience and your doctor will find the right one for you. Different meds work diffent for everybody. "

Within a couple of months I was happy- didnt think negatively and was much more social.  About a year later I decided to try life without it- big mistake!  I gradually went off it with Dr.s instructions and didn't have any bad side effects and felt ok for about 2 months, but those old feelings of low self-esteem, feeling empty and not getting joy out of things came back.  I tried to live with it, but could not and went back on Paxil.  Again, within a couple of months I was my happy self.  I stayed on it for 3 and a half years & was so very happy just being me and living life.  In october 2007 I decided to wean off it (again no negative affects, very ease weaning)even though I was scared that I could return to the very sad empty me, I wanted to see if after 3 years i had retrained the way my mind works and also husband and I thinking of trying for baby (paxil linked to birth defects).  Was ok until about June 1-- stress of job change (career move) I think induced my anxiety and depression began.  I believe if I had been on Paxil during this career change I would have dealt with it ok since I changed jobs before while on it and was fi.  But I have again fallen into the deep pits and see no way out.  Went to Dr. to get prescription for anxiety/depression other than paxil in case I need to stay on med if I get pregnant.  Was prescribed Celexa and its only day 3 but I feel horrible- more anxious, not feeling happy yet (but again only day 3)cant get more than 5 hrs sleep, cant concentrate..and my new job starts in just a couple weeks!  I will hang in there with Celexa and try to take with sleeping pills, but if no improvement within the next few weeks will most likely go back to Paxil..even though that in itself makes me sad because BEFORE I fell back into this depression I so wanted to start a family soon with my wonderful husband, and I feel like I may have to take this wonderful happy pill the rest of my life...

I was on Paxil from June 2004 through December 2006 and during that time gained 50 lbs. No other changes in appetite or exercise. When i tried to take off weight, it was very difficult. My doctor finally changed me to Cymbalta when she realized that I had ballooned in weight and she thought that the Paxil ahd something to do with it. 
It also lost its efffectiveness after awhile and I began to have some depression symptoms returning.

I went to see my doctor about it the following Monday and she decreased my dose to 15mg. I still felt sick to my stomach, but my mood was ok. I decided to play with it and take it with dinner (on a full stomach)rather than at bed time like I was told to do. Now I feel fine.

effects at all and I went off myself, cutting the does every 2 weeks and did not have ANY problems.  For me it quite literlly was a life saver, but then everyone reacts differently."

Not so many extreme lows.  Still waiting to see the longer term effects.  Just wondering....has anyone experienced sensitivity with their teeth to hot or cold foods?  Seems like I have an extreme sensitivity to cold liquids since beginning this medication.  I haven't read anything in the literature that would suggest that this is a side effect, but I could swear I read or heard about this somewhere.  Comments?"

Initial inability to climax during intercourse (men and women) fades after several months. Only real problem is that quitting is REALLY hard.  I haven't had any psychological withdrawals, but the physical withdrawals were FAR more intense than the 'slight flu-like symptoms' described by the manufacterer.  My symptoms were more like serious sea-sickness or a bad hangover... inner ear seemed to be off in me and I felt the room spinning until I took some of the drug.
I took it initially in 1998 after a breakup and have been unable to kick it due to the  discomforting side effects.  Anyone have a solution?"

Only I am concerned about the long term effect.
And how do I stop taking Paxil with safety?
I am no longer depressed or grumpy.
Thank you.

I can eat again, as I had no desire to eat. Just ate because I had to. I am able to sleep normally again. Gave me a better outlook on life. Thank you
253$Condition: Depression$12/12/2007 11:45:30 AM$Reviewer: toscana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$I have only been on the drug for about 3 weeks now but I am already beginning to see a benefit.  I have not had as many panic attacks and the ones I have had are not as severe.  Also, my depression has been more manageable.  Dealing with the daily things that cause me stress are easier to deal with as well.  When I first started taking it I had headaches and some pretty bad stomach aches as well but those are gone.  I'm dealing with dry mouth now but I'm fairly certain that it will go away after my body is completely adjusted to the drug.  This has been a God send to me.  I am so glad my doctor suggested it to me.  I had gotten to a point where I was once again contemplating suicide and could barely make it through the day.  I now am doing much better.  I'm a little nervous about what will happen if I decide not to take it down the road but will try not to worry about that until it comes up.
254$Condition: Depression$12/5/2007 3:52:26 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I started on Prozac when i was first diagnosed with major depression in 1999 which worked very well. However, my liver functions were abnormal so I was taken off Prozac and put on Paxil as an alternative to help treat the depression and OCD. Paxil proved to be a viable subsitute but after about 6 years it's effectiveness has seemed to wear off.  I struggle with depression in spirts and especially during the colder months when the days are shorter.  I have not had any side effects to speak of with Paxil (paroxetine, i have been on the generic equivalent) but it seems to have pooped out. I am now beginning to slowly reduce my dosage in order to introduce Zoloft into my system. Hopefully this will work!
255$Condition: Depression$11/28/2007 6:48:43 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$4$5$This is a medication which demonstrates a gradual change in your behavior.  Having been on this medication now for about 5 and a half months, I am starting to see the benefits.  I have noted however that I do need to change my thinking habits (negative thoughts towards myself, suicidal fantasies, etc).  
256$Condition: Depression$11/27/2007 1:54:04 PM$Reviewer: Worried, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I have recently become VERY depressed and even attempted suicide.  My doctor prescribed Lexapro which made me jittery, gain weight and have a very low libido.  So, he switched me to Paxil.  I haven't gotten the prescription filled yet, but have a couple of questions for anyone who can or will be willing to help.  Vanity may be too much of a concern to me, but I don't want to gain weight or have no sex drive; especially since I'm 47, I enjoy sex a lot.  How much weight can I expect to gain (an average amount, please) and does it effect sex drive that much?  I'd rather be depressed than not have sex or be a total fat ass!  Please help by posting your answer on this site.  Thank you so much!

The drug helps others, so perhaps it didn't mix well with my body chemistry. After a year of trying different dosages, my doctor finally switched me to Zoloft -- and that drug gave me back my life.

However it is VERY DIFFICULT to get off the drug.  I urge anyone considering going on the drug to do some research on the web and discover the awful things that happen to people that are experiencing withdrawal from Paxil.
