1$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$8/15/2019 4:48:05 PM$Reviewer: Sheryl, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$I was put on this medication 22 years ago after a complete hysterectomy. Not being able to take the hormone pills. This has worked great. I function very well with it. It's 2019, and all the dr's want to take you off it. Called control! Well it's too late, and I am thinking about the ER pill of this may keep it in my system longer and not having to take it 4  x daily. It will be like pulling teeth with the dr. But yes this works very well for Anxiety, panic attacks and etc.
2$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/5/2019 1:08:43 PM$Reviewer: LeeLee, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I previously took this medicine every day, along with my antidepressant which I have been taking for years.  I now only have to take alprazolam as needed, if I have anxiety, or trouble getting to sleep and it works great.  I guess if I wasn't on the antidepressant I would probably have to take the alprazolam daily.  But I have had no problems with alprazolam being addictive, ever.  It has helped me in the past when I've had severe anxiety attacks, and it now continues to help if I still have anxiety attacks, and problems getting to sleep.  I'm happy to have this med, and would recommend it to anyone needing relief from anxiety or sleeplessness, etc.

9$Condition: Chronic Trouble Sleeping$11/11/2017 12:59:27 AM$Reviewer: 65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have tried or still use Ambein (12.5 mg), Lorazapam (2 mg) and Tamazapam (15 mg). Tamzapam is completely ineffective. Lorazapam requires 4.5 mg to put me to sleep). Ambein is effective if I use 18.25 mg). Xanax works quite well with 4 mg. If I want more than 4-5 hours sleep I take 12.5 mg Ambein with 2 mg of Xanax. I end up using various combinations of these medications because most doctors freakout at the prospect of habituation. One doctor told me at 66 years old I should take Xanax as little as possible so I get .5 mg tabs and take every other day. Like this is supposed to do something? .5 mg has no effect on occasional anxiety. I use Librium 25 mg on jet flights for anxiety and it works fine. Best all around drug for insomnia, anxiety, and muscle spasms is Valium but that's dangerous medication when taking Oxycondone. For basic insomnia Xanax works best for me.

When an attack grabs hold of me, I put 1/2 of a 1 mg under my tongue and within minutes the attack is stopping. Without it, the attacks last longer and repeat over and over. I was told to take 2 a day but I still only take it when I need it. This way I avoid the ""addiction"" reaction that the doctors are afraid of."

14$Condition: Chronic Trouble Sleeping$2/2/2017 10:49:49 PM$Reviewer: strbrite, 65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$My doctor prescribed this for my insomnia and I was first taking 1mg at bedtime.  One night I had 3 seizures.  After that he increased the dose to include .25mg 3x daily.  I read some pretty horrifying stuff about this drug and wanted to get off of it but do so in a sane and safe manner.  I am now down to taking a .25mg tab and cutting it in half and then in half again (not easy).  My doctor is very supportive and wants a long slow reduction in order to avoid seizures, etc.  I highly recommend not taking this drug.  Do a google search and read about the difficulties people have had trying to get off of it.  NEVER quit taking it cold turkey.  I have NEVER abused ANY medications, but some are really dangerous. I am now exploring the world of essentials oils and more natural ways to deal with insomnia.

16$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/28/2016 4:52:19 PM$Reviewer: thomasinjc, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$5$4$I suffered from a brutal childhood and now with a diagnosis of PTSD, (Vietnam Vet.) I diagnosed by a board certified DO, and a psychiatrist who also agreed. With the addition of Elavil at bed time the nightmares a and daily morning severe anxiety, fear upon waking are very well controlled. As a Navy medic we used these med's which in most cases alleviated (permanently) all symptoms. Xanax was developed and marketed as a non addicting form of valium which is. In my experience I can now alleviate the pain of severe anxiety every morning. It may be psychologically addicting for some but that's it! I now live a more normal life than ever before going back all the way to my days in Vietnam. I wish more doctors would drop their bad opinions so that more people would not have to suffer!          
17$Condition: Panic Disorder$12/4/2016 12:48:47 PM$Reviewer: PearPicker, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$3$I suffer from Panic Disorder Generalized Anxiety and Depression, but even in the mist of a panic attack I often opt to skip the Alprazolam. This medication numbs and sedates me, which can help at times, since these sensations are often preferable to panic, but I do not feel relaxed or able to enjoy things (reading, eating, sex, etc). Alprazolam transforms me into a sleepy zombie, it does not feel like a solution.

24$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/2/2016 9:52:43 PM$Reviewer: Navillus 55, 75 or over on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have suffered from depression and anxiety since earliest childhood due to a physically abusive parent and then an extremely poor marriage.  I began taking Alprazolam in my early thirties for extreme tinnitus.  Now,  at age 78, I take a 75 mg. capsule of Effexor XR daily and one mg. tablets of Alprazolam three-to-four times daily as needed.  I can truly say this has been a life saver for me...  Once in a great while I have a mild panic attack, but I can lead an otherwise normal life.  I purchase the generic Effexor XR in Canada, but the Alprazolam is unbelievably inexpensive and I purchase it at a local pharmacy.

27$Condition: Panic Disorder$4/19/2016 9:33:29 AM$Reviewer: laurie2860, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have suffered with panic attacks/social agoraphobia since in my teens.  I'm now in my 50's.  I have been on Xanax/Alprazolam for 30 years now.  Plain and simple...it works for me.  Before the medication, I would have terrible panic attacks.  I couldn't go out to eat, I couldn't go see a movie in a theatre, I couldn't get on a bus/plane or in an elevator, I couldn't be in crowded places.  Basically, I had a very difficult time functioning in social surroundings.  Once I was properly diagnosed by a very sweet, kind and understanding psychiatrist, I was placed on the drug and within days started feeling better.  I was able to concentrate more on the job, in my marriage, in social activities.  Basically, this drug saved me.  I have had to had the dosage increased and decreased at times, depending on my stress level.  The only side effect I have from it is mild drowsiness.  I take the med 2-3 times per day at a low dose now.  If I don't take it, my body tells me ... take your medication lady!  This drug has been around for a very long time, therefore not costly and it IS effective in treating my illness.  I am very stern when it comes to, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  In my case, if it works, don't change it.

29$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/5/2016 4:47:10 PM$Reviewer: Alicia, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I started with alprazolam .5 ER a week ago,and I cannot express enough the tremendous difference between the ER and regular medication. The effectiveness of extended-release is crucial to battle generalized anxiety, because it's something that lasts ALL DAY; not just an hour or so. I had previously suffered my day-to-day routine at work and basically kept my head down and avoided eye contact- even with my family. Now, in the past week I have noticed my behavior change drastically in the sense that I'm not fearful to walk down a hallway, be in a crowded store,sit at a red light with other cars; and the list goes on. I went shopping with my boyfriend the past weekend and was amazed when I caught myself joking around with two women behind us in line and then another woman in the parking lot.(Both conversations that I actually initiated) That spirit has been gone for years now and is finally coming back. I don't feel angry anymore and most importantly (to me at least) I don't feel that overly calm- almost numb feeling from taking a regular alprazolam. I couldn't be happier or recommend this medication enough for generalized anxiety!

But i can deal with it since I`m very sensitive to medicines and had severe problems with other drugs before. Alprazolam has been a life saver for me.

I ""fired"" her and found another doctor (LNP) who I really liked.  After I got insurance I had to find another doctor because my insurance will not pay for a nurse practitioner.  The doctor I have now isn't a fan of alprozolam either and wants me to come off of it, but I am very strongly against it.  It has kept me functioning and being able to actually live life.

If you have any history of addiction or even a proclivity toward addiction, Xanax can be a death sentence. You tolerance increases, it becomes less effective and you require more and more until it's hard to separate if your anxiety is real or if your anxiety is related to when you will take your next Xanax pill. Now how depressing is that? VERY depressing. It's a downhill spiral. The pharmaceuticals LIE about the addictive nature of this drug. Please beware.

I have been on it for 25 years off and on again.  I have taken as much as 3mg daily, and as little as .5mg daily.  I can sleep at night when I take it.  Once when I had to take a brief break, my MD removed it all at once.  I was so nauseous that the world moved too fast spinning on its axis.  Now I taper off gradually.  No nausea.  It's not expensive.  90 1mg tabs generic without any insurance only costs about $14 monthly at my local pharmacy."

Of course, my tolerance has increased, therefore, my dosage has done the same but this medication works well for me.

Since I lost my job my anxiety has gone through the roof, causing panic attacks, chest pain etc. I'm on it again, 1/2 of .5 mg twice a day and it is a blessing so far. It enables me to have a fairly normal day and helps keep the negative thoughts away. It's a low enough dose that I can play with it a little based on how I am feeling at the time. Is it for everyone? No. But for those of us that are have out of control anxiety and panic, it is good to have around.

When I get anxious I tend to also get angry and it prevents all anger. After reading other reviews, I agree it does taste terrible. As for the lady that her insurance stopped paying for it, it is a relatively inexpensive medicine. Although I use my local pharmacy which is around 22 dollars without insurance I believe it is a medicine that is involved with alot of the 4 dollar programs that exist in the area that I live in. Wal-Mart has the program and they are nation wide. I would look into that.

You do have to respect this drug. It also helps you sleep which can cause addiction. I take it ""as needed"" up to 2 tabs a day. Usually I don't need a full tab so I split them. They will put you to sleep very quickly. I once took a Klondike to eat in bed and woke up with the Klondike melted all over me in the morning. Again, sometimes when I  use it for sleep, it gets to where I lay awake for long periods of time on nights I don't use it. Thus, I take a couple of days off. Be careful and use caution. "

I become tight in the chest, with a feeling of my heart skipping a beat, and the feeling quickly creeps up my chest to my neck, chin and finally my focus is off, and I can't comprehend anything anyone is saying. The actual attack lasts no more than 60 seconds usually and I have varying degrees of them. They start off with just the chest for a couple of times, then get progressively worse. If I take one 0.5mg of alrazolam oral at the start of my symptoms, it usually wards it off. If I am where I don't have one to take and my symptoms worsen it sometimes takes a couple of doses to make the attacks go away.

I only take it when I feel myself starting to have a panic attack and it should be noted that I also take klonopin 1 MG in the morning and at night for generalized anxiety disorder. The downsides of xanax are, for me at least, when it stops working, I get fairly intense headaches, and I do worry about how addicting it can be but my panic attacks were quite severe at times so, all in all I'm pretty happy with this drug
161$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/19/2013 7:26:19 AM$Reviewer: MartinJ, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"I have been taking benzodiazepines for quite some time now following quite a few events in my life that nearly paralized me with anxious thoughts, paraoia, depression, and physically. The first visit to my doctor he prescribed me 2 1mg a day. It honestly worked wonders for me for a few months until I got used to it then had to go up and up and up. If you are looking into getting on Alprazolam do not forget you can become addicted to it very easily. Other than my tolerance which formed very rapidly, the effects also are very short term. More so for people who have panic ""episodes"" not PTSD or paranoid induced anxiety like I do 24/7. It is a very good medicatiom though when used properly, which,  like I said is hard considering it's short lastig effects. One piece of advice, fight the urge to increase dose even if your doctor is willing because in reality you're digging yourself into a bigger hole as coming off them was hell. Best of luck to all of you."

I decided to try stopping it and seeing if I had ""recovered"".  I almost ended up in the emergency room. It took almost 3 months to stop using clonidine to supplement.  I was on it for 6 years with no problems except it had to be increased.  After being off for 4 months, my doctor and I realized I needed to be back on something for anxiety.

I DO NOT have an addictive personality, so taking this medication over a long period of time is not a problem... I have had to stop taking this med a few times in the past, and I've experienced no life threatening issues!  I do NOT recommend (as with any medication to stop taking it ""suddenly"" -that can negatively affect your health; mind & body)! Possibly creating extensive, serious side effects! DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS OR ANY SAME TYPE MEDICATION ""ONE DAY"" COMPLETELY!!! You must have your Dr. wean you off the medication over a good amount of time (months)!!! 
Overall, ""I'm still here & alive thanks to Xanax/Alprazolam,"" due to terrible, ""life threatening"" Anxieties, Panic Attacks, adding to depression from these attacks/nerves, etc., I've had since a late teenager after my special Grandfather passed on (first death I ever experienced,) and kids at school harassing me because I was a shy, good student!! After beginning this med I began working at my first job in a large, high profile, corporation!! Succeeding from a Marketing Assistant to the highest upper Management job/position in the Corporation!!! My anxieties/attacks were no longer controlling my life or rarely in my life any longer!  Thanks to Xanax/Alprazolam!!!
I'm VERY disappointed to now see more & more health insurance companies ""Not Covering"" this ""life saving & inexpensive"" medication anymore!!!??? For one, I just found out in 2013 Blue Cross ""PPO"" is NO LONGER COVERING XANAX/ALPRAZOLAM!?!?!?!?!  I'm disgusted with Blue Cross in their ""detrimental decision"" which will cause illnesses, some life threatening, to their customers & doctor's patients who can't afford another ADDED INSURANCE (non insurance covered expense) THAT WE PAY FOR IN OUR MONTHLY PREMIUMS ALREADY!!!!

I started having attacks while sleeping, wake up, tell my wife I loved her and start looking for the Light they talk about when your dying. A panic attack makes me absolutely sure I'm dying.I had numerous people tell me I was having panic attacks,I mentioned this to every doctor I saw and they said no. I was sent to see a stomach specialist, since they were clueless. My wife called the new Dr. to talk to him he looked at my medical records that had been faxed to him, called my wife back a little ticked and told her that I was having major panic attacks and called in Xanax. I had taken over 15 different medications prescribed to fix all the different conditions I had been diagnosed with. The Dr told me that the meds. had been making my condition worse,to get a lawyer and he would actually go to court with me since he was tired of all the patients he got that were misdiagnosed and over medicated, I had never had a doctor say something like that, but he was as I found out a real Dr., not a pill pusher for the drug Co's.whose favorite show is Dr House. I was not told about the serious withdrawals of Xanax,nor how many things can cause Xanax not to work.I think breathing filtered air has the least side effects, slightly ahead of mountain spring water. ALSO BEWARE If you take narcotic pain meds. for chronic pain daily and Xanax,around 50% of people who go through sudden withdrawal from both at once die. Oh yeah, great to know Doc. I had to find on the Net. I had an operation that left me permanently disabled and in constant pain. I have to temporarily put up with a Dr who thinks most people are just there for the drugs. Unless there wealthy movie stars who get Oxycontin for a paper cut and Xanax to help them sleep after they smoke crack. My attitude reflects, a botched operation, a lying Dr, and a life time of pain. I doubt this will be posted.

I only take the alprazolam when I get anxious and that is usually when I'm reminded of things about my marriage and my children. If one 0.5 mg tab doesn't work I will take two and I'm allowed to take up to 6 tabs per day. I usually don't come near to that amount and do not use it every day. My doctor is very supportive and helpful and is satisfied with my way of using the drug even though it's not on a regular schedule. It does help me sleep when take at bedtime. Overall I am very satisfied with it and when the anxiety gets bad I thank God that I have it because nothing else gives me relief like alprazolam.

My job is high-end and fast paced and in close quarters and sometimes I can get overwhelemed and pissed off to say the least at people, so I take 1/2 of a 0.5 Xanax (sometimes the whole pill) very rarely and it helps mellow me out just enough to relax and forget about the stress. Does NOT cause me to be drowsy so I can work and function on it.  I have taken xanax maybe about 5 or 6 times my whole life and I am 31 years old.  I also have a duodenal ulcer that stresses me out when it hurts, and I can hardly eat anything cause of that. I also suffer from Polycystic Ovarian syndrome and have lots of pain about 1 1/2 weeks every month, and that can be stressful.

286$Condition: Anxious$7/29/2011 4:48:34 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$5$I was taking this medication on and off for about a year for anxiety, and suggested by my rheumatologist to help me sleep for my Fibromyalgia. My anxiety was very mild when I started this medication, but I noticed after taking this medication, my anxiety worsened to the point where I could not funtion. I would panic while driving, and also panic at work and in most social situations. I also became afraid of being alone. I knew this was not normal, and my doctor and I knew that the medication was having an adverse effect on me. Several physicans and a therapist told me that they would not consider Alprazolam to be a recommended daily treatment for anxiety.. it does work, and it can be part of a treatment plan, although it's more of a med for when you actually have the anxiety attack. I am happy that it works for some and it has changed people's lives, but afraid for the people it has caused issues for. I am very grateful that I did not experience and withdrawl symptoms, and I hope for nothing but the best for those of you that have or will struggle with them. Everybody reacts to medications differently, and what works for some may not work for others, but always do what's best for you, and check with your doctor. Take Care!

Buspar made me too dizzy (that 'disconnected' feeling ... head on a post) Effexor made me sick. Abilify gave me a terrible allergic rxn; a nightmare for my dig. sys. and had an unpleasant hallucinegenic property (massive pupil dilation, trails, color fx ...) but NOT a good trip - a VERY BAD ONE. Lexapro 10mg worked ok for 90 days, then I had to leave work early- it made me puke myself down to the bile. Ativan makes me black-out and Valium10mg/20mg makes me sleep too long and forget what day it is, but at least it agreed w/ my digestive and circulat. systems! 
SWITCHING TO XANAX SAVED MY LIFE!!!! I had almost lost hope; my panic attacks are debilitating and interfere w/ normal activity when they hit. I measure the attacks from 1 to 10, but like a Richter Scale (a 7 is 10x stronger than a 6).
1 thru 5 - manageable w/ breathing exercises and quiet meditation. No meds needed.
6- need @ least 1mg.
7- need 2-3mgs.
8 - need 4mgs.
9 - (rare) need 6mgs
10 - (super-rare) I my limbs go numb, ""the blackness"" creeps up my spine and crawls into my brain-stem, I get tunnel vision and once the blackness erodes my brain I pass out. I will be out for 5 minutes or so and probably need medical attention, A good dose of xanax and pain-killers or muscle relaxers because all my muscles tighten up. If I am standing when a 10 hits I will collapse on the spot. (No seizures)

On Xanax, I can sleep if I want, or I can work - the pill goes with me wherever I need to go. 
I am prescribed 1mg tid, but I take it ""as needed"" cuz if u take 3mg every day ... you get addicted and you can't feel it. So I really think ""as needed"" is the therapeutic dose. It averages out to 3,4 or 5mgs each day and I don't deny that I am addicted, but I don't really care - it's cheap and it WORKS and it doesn't make me sick. A Godsend for this writer."

I have had chronic trouble sleeping for a long time, and had been telling my doc about my general anxieties. My dr. put me on .25mg of Alprazolam,nightly.  I've noticed that it REALLY helps me sleep the entire night-usually I'd have a hard time falling asleep/staying alseep.  I've been taking it for 2 months, with the exception of 1 day. When not on it, I tossed/turned instead of sleeping, and was a mess the next day-couldn't work.  This med relaxes me/helps me fall asleep & sleep all night.  Because I've only been on it for 2 mos, I am having some side effects-I am drowsy in the am; I'm noticing that I sleep about 9hrs/night, & still sleepy upon waking. I'm more tired through the day, and sometimes I don't want to do anything at all.  I do think about death; not suicide, but just different ways of dying. Gas, extreme thirst, confusion, dizziness, menstrual changes are the other effects I've been having.  But the flip side of this is that I sleep through the night-a good thing. I wonder if these effects will go away after I've been taking it for longer? Dr's had me on antidepressants a few yrs back, but it was only for a couple of mos @ a time, never long enough to determine their effectiveness. This is the 1st time in 3 yrs I've been on anything.  Overall, this drug helps me cope with the situations in my life.

If I don't take at least half of one a day, my skin starts to crawl and my left arm goes numb and hurts.

I was given this to help with the symptoms of withdrawal from another drug. That was a BIG mistake. I went from the prescribed dosage of 2mg 3x a day to taking a bottle of 90 in less than 3 weeks and consumption of alcohol just made the downhill slide even worse.  It was the worst time or my life and wound up costing me a great job.

Fortunately,I was able to quit cold turkey and not suffer the withdrawal symptoms people describe. It's been 10 years since I kicked this addiction and have not looked back or regretted ridding myself of this terrible addiction......

I take 1 mg 4xs daily with 10 mg of buspar 2xs daily. i know xanax can be addictive but i would be crawling out of my skin without it. My personal and professional relationships have improved greatly. instead of being overwhelmed and obsessed with my own problems i can now care about others. Before trying this I tried 4 different antidepressents and had horrible side effects from all of them. I lost two jobs due to the antidepressents. They caused everything from irrational actions and thoughts to an almost""zombie"" like existence. The possibility of being adddicted to this is a small price to pay for how much my life has changed for the better.I have grown a tolerance to xanax which is why my doctor added the buspar. so far so good. I've been taking the buspar for about 3 months now. it take about 6 weeks to take full effect.sometimes i get a bit of drowsiness after i take the buspar but it goes away within about 20 min. it just makes the xanax more effective for me. This is a combo that works for me wonderfully but everyone is different. It took about six months of trial and error before my doc and i found what works for me. "

For the first 10 to 15 years my anxiety level been off the charts. I tryed to take my own life 3 times to be unsuccessful. I been to many doctors over the coarse many years to be put on several differant kinds of meds to calm me down. but when my doctor talked to me about xanax to calm me down I diden't think much of it cause I never really heard to much about it. But now that I've been taking xanax for about 4 years now, I've now came out of my slump and found my life worth living. Thank GOD for the wonderful miracle of medicine.....

I couldn't rest my mind raced on how was I gonna apply my new energy. I worked out I cleaned house I went a little nuts with myself and not sleeping now, I take .25 before bed and keep a regular schedule bed by 10:30-11:00 and up by 7:00 able to work and be productive and not reeling anymore. Shame that not sure if I can get a refill without going to see the dr, but my gynocologist understands me more than my family practitioner. It is an annointing feeling when their knowledge actually works to make me feel better. Thanks for recommending this for my regime. I needed it and not ashamed to admit it.

I just want to say how sorry I feel when I went to my doctor 6 months ago and agreed to SWITCH my MEDS. I took ATIVAN for about 2 years, my doctor thought it'd be ""BEST"" to switch because I kept having episodes (panic attacks), I had them maybe once a month or so because I am taking LEXAPRO which saved my life. So I AGREED!! WoW, it's soooo addicting and stays in your body for about 38 hours unlike ATIVAN (only 18 hrs), now I have had some withdrawal symptoms (they are nasty) Just like withdrawing from VICODIN..(that's how I can describe it, my friend told me that's how it feels)
Anyway, I am an ultrasongrapher so I am in a med. field and TRUST me people, DON'T TAKE or STOP AS SOON AS YOU PHYSICALLY CAN!!!!! I BET THIS IS THE BEST ADVICE A PERSON ON THIS SITE CAN GIVE YOU.
TO ALL, 
BE HEALTHY AND SAFE

I have always,since childhood, had anxiety,overwhelming moments that basically kept me from being able to get control of myself to calm down and focus.That which made me angry,quick to just lose self control on anyone anywhere. this medication was the best thing that basically ever helped me to be able to stop,think, and react as a ""normal"" person does.One crucial warning to everyone-It is not a miracle cure.Please only take as prescribed,NO MORE.!! If you take to many even a few times and you end up going completely without it can and WILL and DID cause seizures. I was driving when it happened to me.It wasn't just one seizure it was several. I did not kill or hurt anyone except for breaking my own back.Please be careful on this and all medications.Lesson learned-follow directions and take ONLY as your doctor prescribes.And DO NOT stop taking all at once. Let your Dr. take you off slowly. It is safer."

As soon as I put my head on the pillow, the muscles in my chest would cramp & I would almost suffocate.  A Pulmonologist prescribed .5mg tab, 4 times a day.  NEVER did that.  I only took half of a pill at night and slept beautifully.  After several weeks, I did not need the pills & stopped taking them with no ill effect.  For the same chest muscle reasons, I have just started the pill again - half of .5mg - at bedtime & it is a marvel.  I'm actually able to sleep through the night to 5am or even later.  It is a delight not to be on a Vampire's schedule.  I feel quite good in the morning - no ""drugged"" feeling.  I know Xanax is something to be careful with, but it is marvelous for me so far.  "

I will say for people who get full on panic attacks it is gold in a pill form. I used to hyperventilate to the point of almost passing out. But I stopped having panic attacks and I'm 26 now and had them from roughly age 22-23 then a few more throughout the years. But let's say I take it for general aniexty-a family issue arrises-etc it usually-no matter what strenght causes me to black out in a sense. I most often can't recolect any activity I do after taking 1mg of xanax. So I personally only realy keep it on hand for full on panic attacks and when I know I'll be home safe. But I want to warn ne1 who reads this -I know over a dozen people my age who have stolen from me for these pills. Their full on junkies with xanax. It's sad. It's just never done it like that to me-probaly bc I literally and medically needed it. So don't start if addiction runs in your family. Thanks

I've used it for over ten years (went thru some bad medical and financial times then and had to take 2mg about 5 times a day). About 5 or 6 years ago I started taking 1/2 dose only when necessarry and now just use it 6 or 7 times a month. I did experience some withdrawal when I cut the dosage, but not anything severe.

This medication can become addictive and is not meant for long term use.  This stuff is a great boost on days that are particularly terrible.

It does give you a slight euphoric sensation that typically makes me pretty drowsy.  That would be my biggest negative on this stuff, the drowsiness.  Caffeine tends to negate the calming effects of the medicine, so I don't recommend trying to combat the drowsiness with coffee or energy drinks."

She would not go to the doc. She died from heart failure and emphysemia. I had my 1st immobilizing attack at age 17.  It scared me but didn't happen again for 10 years, 3 weeks after the birth of my 1st child.  I was giving him a bath and suddenly I was overcome with fear.  I started sweating,  
I knew something terrible was about to happen and I couldn't move or speak.  My father was a doctor and when I could move I called him and he suggested I go the next day to my doctor.  He told me that anxiety disorders can be inherieted and that I most likely got the gene from my mom.
I tried bio feedback and several other non-rx attempts at controlling these dibilitating episodes.  I found a psychiatrist who suggested I try short acting ativan for use when I would have an attack.  The frequency of attacks was 10+ a week.  By the time I took the pill and waited for it to take effect, I had gone through the worst part of the attack and was almost back to normal.  I didn't find this very helpful.
My doc. told my about the extended release form when it became available and it changed my life. I still experience some situational anxiety and take a short acting med. if needed, but the paralyzing events are a memory now.  Its like the medication in my blood stream is ready and stops the BAD panic attacks from becoming full blown.  I just hope my insurance will keep this on the formulary.  I do not experience any adverse side effects at all.  In fact I get out more and am overall more relaxed because I have stopped wondering when the next attack will come.  I feel I have control now.  Medicine is a good thing when used as prescribed.  I wish my mom had gotten help.
My sister suffers with anxiety as well as my adult son.
They are on different medication , but well controlled.
I LOVE THIS MEDICINE AND MY QUALITY OF LIFE HAS IMPROVED 100%.  Please don't be afraid to try it. "

Xanax was a blessing. I was clear headed, not clouded or confused. It gave me my confidence back for work. However-there are drawbacks. This is VERY addictive. I'm on 1mg x4per day. But there are occasions (like most of you) you take more, some MUCH more. Those cause complete black outs. I remember nothing of what I was doing, even eating out with family and watching a movie. And withdrawls are brutal-NO cold turkey. Work with your doctor to wean off. I still take-with caution and control because they are the only ones that help me control my life and stay focused. Main word there-focused. But it's a fine line of wanting to take just to prevent an attack and just wanting to relax. Even if you think you are controlled be advised. But used properly it has brought my life back to me.

I started off taking it here-and-there when the panic attacks started, but then I started taking it on a daily basis about 10 months ago - almost to prevent any anxiousness and that seemed helpful and like it was a smart thing to do (my doctor prescribed me 1mg 3xday if necessary -- and I was just taking 1mg so I didn't think I was going overboard with it).  And up until a month or so ago, I was taking it daily.  HOWEVER - I started to realize that I have been gaining weight (about 15lbs in the last 8-10 months), which has added to my problems with depression/anxiety.  So I started taking less and less.  I get pretty annoying headaches, and have had some trouble sleeping at night.  I don't necessarily feel addicted to it - but I'm to the point where I've been taking this ""quick fix"" drug daily and relying on it to solve my problems.  But really - from what I've read about it - it's not a good drug to stay on for a long period of time, so I think it's good to have on hand for the panic attacks, but I wouldn't get into the habit of taking it daily - it's pretty annoying to stop taking."

I also work in a high stress environment (phone sales i.e. advertising products sold over the phone) and it helps me to not overreact, spaz if you will, and take things slower. My mind goes really fast & I used to wake up in the middle of the night with pitches running through my head or a trigger from a bad dream & couldn't sleep. Now I don't, and besides that, I only take 1/2 of my perscribed dosage M-F, I don't take it on the weekends, only  when I have to be in an environment that I know will include triggers. It seems to relax me without me needing/craving it. I will say that the ""needing/craving"" not happening did suprise me, given it is a narcotic and can become easily addictive,(i was reluctant to try it) seeing that my womb donor was a drug addict, which make me genetically predisposed to drug addiction. It helps alot and I don't suffer from withdrawls when I don't take it."

If I encounter extreme stress I can take one .5mg tablet and feel so much more relaxed.  With the .25mg, I didn't notice any help, but the higher dosage does work.  I would just recommend to only take in particular situations that can be very stressful.  Do not take with alcohol and do not take unless absolutely needed.

I NEVER slept more than 45 minutes and I had nightmares the whole time, my whole body shook ALL the time like I was having convulsions... I could go on with this forever.

I was prescibed Alprazolam. I have been taking it for almost a year and my body have slowly built a dependence. I started at .5 mg and now up to almost 4mg.  Now if I don't take it I suffer from withdrawal. I have lost interest in mostly everything. I wake up early feeling like I want to jump out of my skin. Sometimes I have horrible nightmares. Days seem just to mesh. I have family support and my doctor is trying to slowly ween me off but it doesnt seem to help. I find myself thinking and rationalizing constantly about everything. I have trouble getting thoughts out verbally without studdering. I wonder if my doctor really understands what this drug does long term. It helped in the beginning but now its my new anxiety. I suggest before you use this drug to make sure its monitored very carefully. The side effects are horrible if you reduce it just a small amount (at least in my case). I wish I had taken another type of treatment non-drug related! I hope this helps anyone so they dont fall into the same trap this drug puts you in long term.

I was jittery, tired a lot, clenching my teeth often, neck pain, short tempered.  I also never felt depressed, so I didn't really believe it was a mental issue.  I tried all the SNRI's and they did absolutely nothing.  I tried Alprazolam but due to it's short half life I had to take it three times a day which was a pain and made me feel like I was on a mood roller coaster.  I am now on the extended release 3mg a day.  It has pretty much eliminated all the symptoms except the constant need for a nap.  I also notice my short term memory and attention span suffer.  I am very concerned about what I have read about long term use and withdrawal symptoms.  I have been taking it about two months, and if I forget to take even one day's pill, I get so jittery that I cannot keep my eyes closed.  I cannot stop talking, and cannot keep one thought in my head for more than a few seconds. I get horrible mood swings.  So the withdrawal and addiction symptoms are something that concern me greatly.  Much worse than before taking it.

My husband is addicted to it and all it does is make him go to sleep.  He thinks because it stops his panic attack he is better.  That is not the case.  All it does is put him to sleep and he does not  get any counseling to address the real problem.  His doctor is aware he drinks beer with this medication and he still gives it to him.  I think a better solution would be to refer him to a psychiatrist to address the real problem and give him medication that could really help him instead of just making him go to sleep.  I understand panic attacks are scary because I see what he goes thru when he has one, but I also think someone that is qualified should help him address his problems.  I also think a regular medical doctor should not be allowed to dispense this medication.  It should only be dispensed by a doctor that is qualified to address the entire situation and not just treat the symptom.

It is nearly a miracle drug and I'm thankful for the help it has given me.  There are times I could not function without it.

I can not even feel the ER working period so I have to take my regular ones throughout the day.

My question was though that last night took somewhere around twenty .5 mg pills in my sleep and have no remeberence of it. My mom found me past out down stairs on the couch. When i thought i was in my room the whole time I evem remember waking up and hitting my snooze alarm. when i got to work all the guys i worked with noticed something was wierd about me. I worked a twelve hour shift today and when i got home my pupils were still huge even sitting in the bright living room. Is this a common occurence?

It was so bad that I couldn't work, I refused to answer the phone, I refused to read email, and I (Still) refuse to open the mail because anything negative would spiral me down the panic/guilt attack cycle. It was so bad that A DREAM would set it off and I would wake up crying and not be able to get back to sleep…

I am on the medications that I can get for free through AID programs through the manufacturer but I HAD to go to the doctor and she put me on Alprazolam 0.5mg (the round, peach kind of pill) and it has saved my life!

I take half a pill when I get overwhelmed at work and if the dream-triggers return, half before bed as well.

I get 15 pills at a time with 1 refill and it takes me 6 months to go through all of them because I only take them as a last resort so I don’t get a tolerance for them and they will stop working and to make sure I don’t get a dependence issue with them as well…

I know there is no such thing as a “Magic Pill” to cure my anxiety and depression but this is the closest thing I have ever found.

I would probably be dead if it were not for my doctor prescribing me this medication.

I have had only 2 side effects. I periodically get forgetful if I take a full pill in a 24 hour period and it makes me sleepy but an extra cup of tea and some thumping music in the background usually pulls me through it…

I'm sure if your here you already know about anxiety. Skipped school, horrible insomnia, and I also have a visual disorder from previous illicit drug use that is made worse by anxiety.

Some days, the anxiety would get so bad I really felt crazy. I had to break down what every person I saw look at me was thinking by their expressions. Much worse was how exaggerated/unrealistic it was, and how it didn't really matter anyways.

The doctor was a little reluctant to give me the medication (I felt like), admitting being a previous drug abuser. She did though, thankfully. I told her I only wanted the drugs on a as needed basis. I was against SSRI's or MAOI's because I've heard from people that it's made many worse, and some suicidal.

Not that it helps I am a big person and asked for a more moderate dose of 2 mg after a couple weeks.

So far so good. There are weeks that I need to take it everyday, and then I'll be fine for a month or so and not even think about taking any.

The anxiety is a funny thing though, feeling as if I don't really deserve them. I break it down into: What is the point at which I need medication? Anxiety can not kill you. But neither can a headache, what point do I ask for help? Probably the point at which I am not sleeping, or going to school, and my relationships are hurting because of it. But I constantly try to talk myself down for it.

But the medication helps me relax a good deal. In the initial few weeks I took it, I almost had a panic attack just from the anxiety of take the pill itself.

I have been addicted to drugs before, and personally am a strong willed person. The doctor told me she didn't want me to get addicted. Withdraw from alprazolam can be fatal. Literally. But so far so good. No urge to use the drug when not needed at all.

That happens to be a side effect of my visual disorder (HPPD). I have built a fear of pycho-altering chemicals. So no abuse."

590$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/16/2008 6:49:32 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I had panic disorder and agoraphobia for a year before trying this at 0.25 mg as-needed. It immediately relieved my anxiety enough to allow me to leave my home and go out again with no side effects. I much prefer it over SSRIs such as Zoloft and Lexapro, which left me feeling 10 times worse than before. Those left me drained and lifeless--just not worth it. I take 0.25 mg of this whenever I start to feel anxious and feel an attack coming on, and it keeps me sustained without making me feel drugged and I do not have an attack. This medication carries a bad stigma because too many people abuse it and ruin it for those that actually need it. If you follow the prescription and don't self-medicate by upping your dosage without a doctor's consent, you should not experience any problems. But because too many people abuse it, doctors are now reluctant to prescribe it which is a shame because it does wonders for people like me who got so bad they couldn't even leave the house. Many say therapy is a better alternative, but not everyone lives in a town big enough to have many of those options--I've seen 3 counselors and all of them were worth nothing. I just take this medication with me wherever I go and take it as-needed. Sometimes I go days without even using it. So here's my advice: it's better than feeling lifeless on SSRIs. Follow the prescription. Don't up your dose or abuse it. If you do that, you shouldn't have problems. Sometimes I feel a little confused or dizzy after taking it, but it also depends on when I ate and other factors. I highly recommend this for people in my situation.

I have tried several meds over the years and this has been the only one that has been able to control my anxiety. For years it was difficult to find a balance because I wasn't depressed, I just had extreme anxiety... esp. in social settings such as ball games, work events, etc. I would have panic attacks out of no where! Over the years, with close observation from my Dr., my dose has been increased- now at 2mg 1x a day. We have talked about me going down in dosage b/c I worry about my future and my body becoming use to the drug. I highly recommend this drug, but under close supervision of your Dr. It can be addictive, but when used correctly, very effective. I don't smoke and don't drink, so it's been working for me!
Best of luck!"

604$Condition: Anxious$9/6/2008 7:02:11 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I am a 26 year old male who never had anxiety before.  It came really quick and all of a sudden.  Tightness in the chest, worry, shakiness, etc....I am able to deal with the symptoms during the day, but at night I usually have to take .5-1mg in order to sleep.  Xanax works really quick for me and within 20 minutes I usually feel like I'm floating!  It last pretty long and to be honest with I still play indoor soccer and regular soccer during the week.  My only question or concern is that sometimes when I don't take it at night, it's very hard to fall asleep!  I was up to 6am the other morning because my mind wouldn't shut down.  Other than that, this drug has worked well.  Very good for traveling in planes and for public situations that might make you nervous.  I just hate having to rely on pills to be normal.  I wish there was some natural remedies that worked for me.  Best of luck to you all with your conditions!  God bless!

I have been taking .25 tablets split in half as needed for many years with no side effects.  Put under the tongue it will relieve symptoms in under 20 minutes.  The side effects increase dramatically the higher the dosage, so discuss with your Dr., esp. if you are taking over 3mg per day. Generally, if you are taking less than 1 mg per day you should not experience significant withdrawal and can just take as needed.  Just having the Xanax with me makes me feel more able to deal with my anxiety, as I know I can take it if I need it.  It's been a lifesaver for me.

Right now i'm on xanax 1mg 4 times a day. If you suffer from extreme anxiety of any kind I would also reccomend in addition to the xanax, taking a SSRI like zoloft, and Inderal. The mixture of the 3 meds. work wonders when used together. I feel sooo much better now, i can actually go out in public and be around crowds of people with out feeling like i'm going to jump out of my skin!!

626$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/17/2008 3:33:13 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I experience random panic attacks (rarely...just a few times a year) and general anxiety at random times as well, often times at night. This drug works wonders. Although I was hesitant at first to take this drug becuase of warnings of addictiveness, I am not addicted to it, as I do not take it everyday, but only when necessary. Whenever I experience anxiety during the day, I just take a tablet and it helps sooo much with my interactions with others. When I experience anxiety at night, it does not force me asleep by knocking me out like other sleep aids, but rather allows me to relax to the point where I can fall asleep instead of being kept awake worring and suffering from anxiety. As long as you take it as directed, I would reccomend this drug to others. I tried lexapro for awhile, but it did not work at all for me.  I am very satified and would reccomend this drug to anyone suffering from anxiety or panic attacks.

So much so that it pretty much took over my life to the point where I didn't want to go anywhere or be around anyone.  I've been on this for 10 years now and couldn't be happier.  If it means that I have to take this 4 times a day for the rest of my life, I'll do so because it makes me feel so at ease.  For me, the benefits outweigh the risks.  I tried antidepressants in the past, but I honestly felt more anxious and had a flat affect for what seemed like all the time.  They made me feel down and out, so I stopped taking them.

So I asked my doctor to prescribe the generic XR version, 1 mg. On the first day, I felt great!!! The drug worked wondered stablizing my panic/anxiety attacks (which are far and few between). I'm also taking a colon cleanser to counteract weight gain. After weighing myself this evening, the scale read 4 addtional pounds from my last weigh in which was yesterday morning. I've consumed healthy foods ALL DAY so I don't understand why I'm experiencing such a tremendous weight gain. I'm going to give Xanax XR a week. If my weight continues to get out of control despite my efforts to maintain a managable diet, I'm going to request my doctor to switch me back to the regular Xanax. Other than that, I feel fantastic!!!

It is a fairly new experience (w/in the last year) for me brought on (I think) by a very stressful job. Was just recently prescribed Alprazolam for stress related chest pains(tests ruled out heart issues), feelings of panic at times, and BP pushed higher by stress.  I take .5 as needed and have not noticed any dependance effects or side effects.  I am able to function well at work and notice that I don't feel drugged, just not as overly worried or stressed about things like usual.  Some days I will need to take all 3 pills (while bp meds are being adjusted and i'm worried about high bp), others only 1 at night or not at all.  I will be careful of dependancy now though, after reading the other posts.  All in all, I would highly recommend based on my experience.  I'm the type who would rather not take a pill, but in this case I am so glad I did...

I usually eat about 5 a day just to try to keep a little even, I usually only needed 1 1mg zanax. But again I have been taking it for awhile for EXTREME panic disorder, I am a national sales manager and my employees can tell when I forget the meds. I would recommend for anyone who has a mild anxiety problem and who has run the gammut on anxiety pills and needs something with a little more umph to it,
669$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/10/2008 5:55:43 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was diagnosed with anxiety after years of therapy by a highly qualifed Dr. I have at least 5 of the symptons shown. I was on numerous meds while in therapy for anxiety & depression but never alprazolam the therapist was afraid of addiction. My primary Dr. prescribed .5 mg at night years ago and it was the 1st time I was able to easily fall asleep. I have never had to increase that amount at night. After continual anxiety related problems my primary recommended this drug on a daily basis of 3mg XR. I discussed my fear of addiction and the Dr. stated there were numerous patients who never had to increase their dose and others over time who needed it increased to have the same effect.Do to my fear of addiction I still do not take the recommended dose but after reading all the reviews and realizing I still do not lead a normal life due to anxiety in many of its forms,I am going to increase my dosage to 2mg and if need be the recommended dosage of 3mg daily.  If you suffer from numerous causes of anxiety, have been through therapy and tried numerous other meds, I would highly  recommend this drug.  I only hope due to insurance or change in doctors that I will never have to go through withdrawl nor have to increase my dosage.

I've also been prescribed Diazapam for the same issue.  I only take them as needed, as I am only prescribed enough to last during a PMS week.

However, the worst withdrawal I have every had from any kind of drug is from this drug. Vomiting for days, incredible sense of smell where everything smelled awful and made the vomiting worse. 3 different times over the course of 6 months I ended up in the hospital but no one could diagnose the problem until one of my pain management doctors told me it sounded like alprazolam withdrawal symptoms.  I have never taken another one since and have been fine. I am now taking diazepam and doing fine. But please watch how you take alprazolam and de-finitely discuss with a health care professional how to taper off the drug.  I have had 17 surgeries over my lifetime but I was never so sick as I was these 3 times.  Be careful........................

Not sure about the addiction thing though because I have gone days without and am fine until I have another attack to the point where I cannot breath, sweat severely, and feel as though my heart is going to pop out of my chest and within 3 minutes after putting two .25mg on my tongue I am myself again.

I had been having chest pain/pressure and took a .5 times 2 in an hour and not only did I relax, but the chest pain went away.

Although he was hesitant, my doctor prescribed Alprazolam to try for a couple of weeks.  I'd have to say that it has been very effective.  I only take 1/2 of a .5mg pill when I feel the anxiousness coming on and within about 15 minutes I feel much calmer, yet not ""drugged"".  I can function normally throughout my work day and I feel it actually helps me concentrate better and be more productive.  I'm not saying this is a miracle drug, it has just helped me through getting over the holiday slump and depression."

Works fast, has a very mild sedative effect in small dose (compared to Diazepam) and is fast relief from muscle or neurological spasms associated with multiple sclerosis. Only problem is it can be very easy to become dependent and it was hard to find a doctor to help taper off. In addition, missing a dose or stopping the medication after prolonged use can cause severe insomnia and anxiety worse than before being prescribed. Use with caution.
