I take 7.5mg coupled with 50mg hydroxyzine (Atarax), which works well at allowing me to go to sleep, but I don't STAY asleep, and I STILL need help with severe anxiety (due to real-life problems . . . I'm bedridden, husband has cancer, COPD and A-fib; we have no insurance! Lost business, home, cars, investments, and used all of our savings). Newly developed symptoms are:
constant ACID INDIGESTION
lower BACK PAIN
MUSCLE CRAMPS/SPASMS
TACHYCARDIA (racing heart)
WEIGHT GAIN (seven pounds in first two weeks)

 this medication after 4 years of being on venlafaxine.  Remeron (mirtazapine) did help me sleep better; however, I began experiencing back and muscle pain, headaches, and severe nausea.  I will not use this medication again."

4$Condition: Depression$6/16/2016 7:42:20 PM$Reviewer: becccc, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$4$took mirtazapine for 3 months total. 1 month on 15mg, 2 months on 30mg and tried 45mg in between. started helping me right away until 2 months in. it stopped working and gave me extreme anxiety and palpitations, and gained 10-15 lbs in 3 months. doctors said i could stop taking it without tapering because i wasnt on it for long so i did and i ended up in the hospital with nausea, dizziness, sleeping 2 hours a night for a week and a heart rate of 150bpm. my advice: theres way better antidepressants out there that are safer to start and withdrawl from. mirtazapine withdrawl is horrible, and i only took it for 3 months. cant imagine the withdrawl from years of taking it. worked well for the depression but not for anxiety. overall, just try it as a last resort after trying SSRIs.

So far I am so sleepy and hung-over in the morn I can't get my day started. Hungry too, most of the time. 15mg which is low but, Lord is this stuff different. Will see if it helps with moods, etc. Need to get up and make myself move!! Walk, housecleaning, something!! I hope I start feeling better soon, if not, will call the doctor.   
6$Condition: Depression$3/2/2016 6:04:25 PM$Reviewer: MNDreaming, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$After Celexa made me sick in just 2 doses and Zoloft caused severe urgency and sexual side effects at just 50mg, I was switched to Mirtazapine.  WOW!!!!!  4 months at 15mg and I'm sleeping well and the mood support is fantastic.  It was paired with Clonopin (also excellent) and I can't say enough about this drug.  I believe it is the most overlooked A/D out there.  Helps with sleep, anxiety and mood support.  I have had literally ZERO side effects.  Please note, I have no experience yet tapering off, so I can't comment on that at all yet.

9$Condition: Depression$10/20/2015 10:20:43 PM$Reviewer: Anita, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$3$5$I was hospitalized for 10 days after trying to commit suicide due to a dark depression following the death of my husband.  This medication was given to me along with Trazodone and Melatonin.  It sure lets me sleep good.  In fact, I want to sleep ALL the time!  When I get up in the morning, I feel sedated and I feel that way until mid-afternoon. I have been on this medication 14 days and have gained 2 lbs so far.  If I continue to put on the weight, I will protest.  Dr will have to change my medication because gaining weight would create another depressive mood!
10$Condition: Depression$9/29/2015 6:36:46 PM$Reviewer: ReadingGirl, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$Was dealing with cancer and was given Remeron for depression. After having surgery for the cancer which was successful I continued with the drug but was having issues with my blood pressure.  My BP would drop over 20 points when I stood up and I would lose my breath when walking short distances. All symptoms went away once I quit taking the drug. I would not recommend this drug to anyone as it set my recovery back greatly.
11$Condition: Depression$5/28/2015 4:21:15 PM$Reviewer: sup, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I was prescribed Remeron 30mg (on top of 30mg escitalopram) for panic disorder and depression. It has worked wonders for my panic attacks: I have not had a full-symptom panic attack since starting it. It also puts me to sleep every night which is highly appreciated.

The downside: weight gain. I do not eat more than before I started, and yet I gained weight all year. I'd recommend frequent exercise or reducing your regular calorie intake if you want to avoid gaining weight, even then not sure it's possible. "
12$Condition: Depression$1/25/2015 2:40:17 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$5$You will gain a tremendous amount of weight if you use Remeron. I was hungry literally all the time! I am a skinny to muscular guy who tried this drug for about 6 months and I gained over 30 pounds! The only thing that worked is it helped me sleep due to the weight gain. I normally don't eat very much or have an appetite, but I would go out for breakfast and eat a full pancake breakfast followed by more sweet items and I would still be hungry. I felt like a pregnant woman with cravings for constant food. Stay away from this drug! There are too many better alternatives out there.

Over course I have cut out sugar and speed walk 2 miles about 5 days a week. But I had been doing that prior. Not the suger decrease but the excersie.

Finally my doc tried Remeron on me and I began to improve. I always claim that Remeron saved my life. I'll always be on several other antidepressants in addition to the Remeron due to the severity of the depression but at least I don't feel suicidal any longer.

I am taking it for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Helps well with all three I went from about 1 panic attact a week to one or two at year. I started taking 15mg but was still having some symptoms and asked my dr to up my dose a little so I am now taking 30 mg and very please. I did have strange dreams a lot at first now they are occasional. I did gain weight but seeing that I was 92 pounds(I am 5'7) this was a good side effect. I do sometime eat in the middle of the night and not really remember it but I don't really care about that I find it funny. I am very pleased with the results and continue to take it
24$Condition: Depression$1/19/2014 8:49:37 AM$Reviewer: Jayne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$Everyone's body chemistry is different. For me, this drug was a nightmare. I had researched medications to combat anxiety-based insomnia and thought this was going to be the solution -- one pill to counter depression/anxiety and insomnia. This wasn't the case for me. When I took the lowest dosage (15mg) I experienced heart flutters and severe dizziness (think being on top of a roller coaster or how you feel with a panic/anxiety attack), at odd intervals -- every 30 minutes or so, it would last a minute, then stop, then repeat in another 30 or so minutes. It also knocked me out. Remeron is incredibly effective for sleep, in fact I was still stoned the next day nearly 16 hours later. And that was at the lowest dosage. I honestly don't know how people function on this drug, I couldn't. Bad experience for me. But again, everyone's body chemistry is different, so what didn't work for me, may work for you. After my experiences with this drug, I got off of it immediately and went to my doctor who prescribed another drug (pristiq for anxiety/depression and oxazepam for insomnia -- both working exceptionally well for me).

29$Condition: Depression$6/18/2013 11:56:44 PM$Reviewer: raqueltio, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$"Of all the medications my psychiatrist put me on---this was the very worst. It turned me into a zombie by interfering w/my gross motor skills, I tripped on carpets, steps, etc. I also gained weight and had no affect. For me it was poison, and after 3 months I insisted on going back to Zoloft, the only one that has worked for me, although I can't sleep well
when I am taking it. To counteract this I was given Ambien Controlled Release and a low dosage of Klonopin/Clonazepan to take before going to sleep. This combination has worked for me, but it took several years to find the right meds and dosage. I am now my ""normal"" self. Please don't lose hope and know that there is an effective combination for you too. Good luck!"

35$Condition: Depression$2/18/2013 11:09:20 AM$Reviewer: Rivers, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I had tried several SSRI type anti-depressants, but had awful side-effects..  Mirtazapine is a differant type, and it has worked great for me.  I was having insomnia and very little appetite, and was getting extremely thin.  My sleep has returned to a normal 8 hrs. and my appetite is normal.  I was having panic attacks, which stopped the first night I started taking this medication.  I was also having much anxiety,  which I took Xanax for.  The dr. Prescribed Clonazepam as a supplement to replace the xanax.  I stopped needing the Xanax immediately, and take .5mg of Clonazepam as needed to supplement the Mirtazapine.  I am very happy I kept trying until I found something that was right for my body chemistry, as the SSRI's were not.  The clonazepam can be taken long term if needed without getting dependent on it.  Hope this helps someone out there.  Don't give up!
36$Condition: Depression$12/29/2012 3:29:34 PM$Reviewer: feeling better, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$This is my 2nd time being treated for depression. This time I have severe insomnia vs the first where I slept all the time. Due to my success with Effexor the first time, I felt it necessary to stay with the same class of drugs. Due to the insomnia, I switched to remeron. This medicine has been extremely beneficial in eliminating the insomnia and preventing the lack of concentration. My mood is better. Overall, I am reporting improvement from this medicine. I agree that it increases your appetite but all medicines increasing levels of serotonin do. If you stick to a strict diet regimen, the weight gain will not be as pronouned.

The anxiety seems to cause the depression in my case. I have been on the meds for about a year now, I gained weight (which i needed) and I've been pretty happy. I have been able to travel overseas and I took a very large course load in college this past Spring! I haven't worked since I've been on this particular pill, but I am working with my therapist to get to where i feel confident again. I highly recommend this to people who are underweight, it increases your appetite to a normal appetite level, so you are actually able to put on (and keep on) weight if needed!!

I tried many other meds. before this one and this is the only one with no side effects and actually made my suicidal thoughts go away. I've had to adjust the dose up and down over the years between 15mg and 45mg, mainly staying at 30mg. I've been using it for 11 years now and I can't convey enough how it has changed my life for the better.

This aided sleep, however it the drowsiness lasted for part of the next day, coffee helped.

Thankfully the drowsiness tends to disappear after a while.

I am now at 45 mg, and it only seems to give a good antidepressant response when combined with prozac (fluoxetine). Neither agent alone works very well, but together they form a potent antidepressant that works for me.

Weight gain not an issue, I exercise regularly."

Remeron worked wonderfully for my anxiety.  first two weeks were hard, couldn't get up in morning and i gained 10 pounds.  Needed the weight, but can't control cravings for sweets and food in general. never feel full.  Have got weight under control but can't have anythign sweet in house and have to really watch what i eat and go to gym.  if i miss gym for a week, weight piles on.

69$Condition: Depression$9/4/2011 6:54:16 PM$Reviewer: anxiousdepressed, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$1$5$This medication worked very well for my depression, anxiety and social anxiety, however, it increased my appetite so much that I gained 10 lbs in 6 1/2 weeks, so I discontinued taking it. Now, 5 months later, I'm still trying to lose the excess weight. I took it knowing of this possible side effect, but I thought that I might be able to control the weight gain, but I was not prepared for the incredibly voracious appetite that the drug created. I thought about food constantly, and I could not feel when I was full until my stomach actually hurt from overeating. I probably would have gained 100 lbs. had I continued taking the drug. I would never take this medication again unless I planned to commit suicide and no other antidepressants existed.

After having 5 grandparents die in 4 years, this was finally diagnosed.  Started with 15 mg and moved to 7.5 mg after a 1 1/2 years due to ""hangover"" symptom.  Have been on it for about 5 years now and just now reading reviews.  Weight gain has been the problem for me, after blowing my knee out from cycling.  But, now it is just the motivation factor that I need to work on in the future.  You have to be conscious of the foods you are buying and what you are eating.  I know this from experience and know what needs to be done to render it.  The sleep that I have gotten has been GREAT! After not sleeping for more than 3-4 hours a night for 4 years, I average about 8 hours a night, setting two alarms to get up by in morning.  Also, 5-hour energy shots have been a life-saver without adding calories. Now that I know others are having problems with the weight gain, I can focus more on my eating habits..."

I had taken Zoloft for quite a few years and it helped with depression but did nothing for the anxiety.  I had to white knuckle the anxiety and use xanax for panic attacks.  Last year, Zoloft quit helping with my depression and I was suffering.  I tried a few alternate anti-depressants with no success.  However, ffter taking Remeron for 2 days, I was back to my old self and able to sleep.  The most amazing aspect is that I have had no anxiety or panic attacks at all.  I've had anxiety for so long that I had forgotten how peaceful I could feel.  I love Remeron but it does make me sleepy during the day.  My MD, is going to up my dose to 45mg from 30 mg. to see if that will help with the sleepiness.  I haven't had any weight gain or food cravings.

The drug did not have any sexual side effects like other anti-depressants that I have tried, but I got so fat while taking it, that I didn't feel like having sex anyway. I weighed 134 lbs in July, and got on the scale in early January and I weighed 166 lbs. I have been off this med for 2 weeks and my doctor and my family have been helping me monitor my mood. My appetite is back to normal and I've lost about 4 lbs since stopping. I guess I'd rather be thin and depressed for now. I am working on making healthy lifestyle choices to try to combat the depression. I am so sick of pills!

Before, I was prescribed a 150 mg daily dose of trazodone before going to bed to help me sleep.  I usually took 75mg to 150mg.  However, it didn't seem to work at all for sleep.  Just okay for depression.  First night of Remeron didn't help at all, either.  Took a couple of hours to feel drowsy and had light, broken sleep afterward.  Still hopeful, though.  I could take an Ambien CR 12.5 mg but I'm trying not to take them that often as they are expensive.  Time will tell.  Not sure of how it will work for my depression.

I have gained 10LBS seems like it's all in my stomach and am having issues with water retention (4 lb difference between morning and night)but I'm not positive if the edema is the remeron or not as I also take other pills.

I've been taking this med for a little over 5 months, everything seemed to be going well until recently. My dosage started at 15mg and then increased to 30mg after a couple of months. Since the increased dosage to 30mg, I have been having some balance problems, and now blood tests have shown that my blood counts are low and I have a iron deficiency. Dr. lowered med from 30mg to 15mg and told to eat more foods that have iron. This med keeps your mouth extremely dry and you need to carry water with you where ever you go. I have noticed that my feet and hands have swelled and I've gained 25lbs. Dr. said she would probably have to change my meds. I am also taking 2 - 20mg generic form of Paxil per day also. Prior to the mirtazapine, I was taking Paxil CR 75mg per day. I really hoped that this med would be beneficial to me, which it has been. But now it seems like it has made different medical issues arise.

Depression or Negative thoughts have lessened to the point to where I dont dwell on the negative and notice increased POSITIVE thoughts and energy. Increased appetite is a factor, but exercise will power for the first month or so and your weight gain will be minimal, if any. I actually am at a lower wieght because I feel better and am more active now. Can't speak for all... but its been a life saver ""litterally"" for me."

So now I've started 15 mg. of Mirtzapine.  The first night I took a whole pill and slept all night and all the next day--it was awful.  But my doc had warned me and said to take half, if that happened.  The half pill works, but after about a week (today) I'm going to try taking a whole one again.  I'm an artist and a writer and haven't done any creative work in a year...the only thing Welbutrin didn't cure...but this week I've been painting AND writing, so I'm excited about this combo.

It really helped me a lot. The best part is it makes you happy and sleepy, so u just take it when you are ready for bed in the next half hour or so.It also has antihistamine properties, so I no longer take allergy pills. Very little in the way of side effects.  A little bit of nightmares in the beginning or  when adjusting to a higher dose. Before Remeron I tried different SSRI's and SNRI'S but they killed my sex drive and made me super constipated. I started at 15 mg slowly went up to 30mg after a while. Truly a wonder drug for me. Don't give up on antidepressants until you've tried Remeron!

I'm a size 4 and don't have an unusual eating habit, but I ate so much that day (three trips to the office vending machine), that by the end of the day my stomache was very distended.

I must admit it worked well at the beginning and I gained a well needed 20 pounds which I have lost along with my appetite after it ""pooped-out"" two and half years ago. My psychiatrist wants to add another anti-depressant but I refuse and he will not hear of it. Tried Cipralex 10 mg and it made me feel awful: burning sensation in digestive tract,sore belly,nausea,no appetite. I stopped after one pill. I feel  angry,frustrated,inadequate,I hate myself and I hate to get up in the morning to face another day of misery. My anxiety level is at a record high and I feel that my life is not worth living. When you feel better,are you not supposed to stop taking those mind -altering drugs? I am beginning to think that psychiatrists are only drug pushers. I want out and be my old happy self again before I got depressed!!!I cannot make important decisions and I am totally overwhelmed by any little problem. More drugs will not benefit,of that I am convinced! Psychiatry is not a science. On top of that,I have developed a stage 3 chronic kidney disease and have to check my creatinine level every 3 months and I blame Remeron for that! Thanks Remeron but no more!!!!!!"

He actually has EMOTION on his face now (before his face was just blank), he is interacting WELL w/ everyone in the facility (before he would have just stayed in his room), and he is actually having LONG CONVERSATIONS (before he would sit in a corner and rebuke anyone who attempted to engage him in coversation).  They have him on a low dose, but it seems to be working.  The doctor is talking about increasing his dosage just to see how he does, but I'm going to tell him to tell the doc that he is HAPPY with the current dose.

However, getting the ""munchies"" seems to make sense to me... as it improved my GERD, it sent my appetite through the roof (causing weight gain) until I identified the fact that the weight gain was coming from the med and that I could reverse it w/(a very high degree of!) willpower."

I was hung over all day, and sometimes almost fell asleep during my long expressway commute. At work I was flat, no anxiety, but no affect, almost like a zombie. When I told my psychiatrist he increased the dosage, telling me the side effects of flatness and weight-gain would go away. Although this sounded counter-intuitive, I was so desperate that I agreed. After 8 weeks on it, I began to notice another problem: it interfered with my gross motor skills. I kept stumbling and falling down. That was the end of Remeron for me. I asked my doctor to put me back on Zoloft, which had made me feel like myself, but had the side effect of insomnia. He put me on Ambien Controlled Release and Klonopin (Clonazepan) for sleep. This has worked very well and I am still taking them, including 50 mg. of Zoloft. I did stop taking Zoloft for a while, but my anxiety and depression came back slightly---though never as dreadful as when I felt suicidal---and I am coping w/my life. I am an older student getting a second post-grad degree, and I was able to do all the paper-work to get into a top-notch school.
This is in high contrast to lying in bed unable to sleep or take care of anything in my daily life. Oh, I did have to resign from my teaching job after coping w/depression for a year on numerous drugs, which didn't work. "

Lots of thoughts would race across my mind causing me to feel all sorts of ways after a week and a half, but after the third week, I was mostly normal.  I'm my second month and I think this drug is helping me work things out in my head, realizing that everyone is not going to like me or agree with me. Even those I love might not like me, that's life, that's the way it is and I can accept this where as before I just wanted to kill myself.

It's older, but it worked better for me than the newer SSRI's everyone raved about. They were terrible for me. The only odd thing about Remeron was that it made me very sleepy in lower doses, but not in larger doses. Took it in conjunction with Wellbutrin, which was okay too, but probably should have just stuck with the Remeron. Can't even remember why I went off it. Doctor's recommendation... 
The worst part of beginning or ending anything was weaning myself off the previous one, waiting a week or so, then titrating up on the new one until at a therapeutic dose...and suffering in the meantime. Docs are only available by voicemail. Sucks."

I started suffering from depression and anxiety which started to become severe. My 7 year relationship with my girlfriend also ended suddenly. Now I stand to lose my house because of the seperation. I started taking 15mg for 6 weeks, then increased dose to 30mg. After initial adjustment, the medication has helped with sleep, depression and anxiety. I have had no panic attacks, and anxiety levels have returned to normal. This medication has helped get me back on track after some extreme stressful situations.

Also, abot 2 weeks after I began using Remeron, I began to forget things. This appeared and worsened over a period of a few days, culminating in one terrifying evening of confusion and short-term memory loss so total and debilitating that I stopped taking the pills immediately (which in turn caused a withdrawal syndrome characterized by dizziness, mania, and a general sensation of surreality about everything. Lasted for a few days then subsided). Remeron was a hellish experience.

It made me a total zombie. I could barely complete sentences the first 2 weeks. It made me very tired and I could NOT STOP eating! Higher doses supposedly give you less side effects, so I went up to 30mg. One night I forgot to take my meds so I took them at 5 am. When I got up at 8am, I fainted in my bathroom. It was really scary!!!! Also, I have gained 10-15 pounds over the last few months. However, after the first few weeks the sleepiness and fogginess subsided.

Yes, I feel better, but I also take Celexa. Also my anxiety has lessened, so there's less to be depressed about. I am going off of Remeron now—mostly because I can't stand the weight gain.

It was and is a Godsend for me. I have recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and my Dr prescribed Lyrica. The combination of Remeron and Lyrica proved to be dangerous for me - I passed out and fell into a chair, while trying to get back to bed after going to the bathroom one night about 2 weeks into taking both medication. I lay where I fell for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Turned out I had broke all the little bones in the upper part of my cheek on the left side. So my Dr changed my medication for depression to Elavil. I will be talking to my Dr to change me back to the Remeron, as I can not take Lyrica of Cymbalta for my Firbo. - I am one of the 15% who gets increased paing on these meds. I much prefer the Remeron, as it also helps several other symptems of Fibro. ie; IBS,anxiety, Also Elavil caused me to crave sweets and carbhydrates and I have gained 15# and my LDL Cholestrol and Triglycerides have risen a lot. I never had these problems on Remeron. and see from reading other articles on this site, Remeron helps with these conditions also. I also slept MUCH better on Remeron! I really like how I feel, and how I sleep on this med. and would recommened that you give it a try if you have any of the deseases it helps treat.

I was in a severe depression, tried several other medications (that were not effective) and finally took remeron.  I felt better within a few days of taking the medication.  The only adverse side effect was that I gained weight taking the drug.  However, I have since stopped taking the medication and am losing the weight.  
220$Condition: Depression$8/3/2008 11:58:09 AM$Reviewer: Jane, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"Remeron has been the only antidepressant that hasn't caused major negative side effects in my case. I take it in addition to Vistaril, and though the effects are very sedating, I think it's a plus in cases of severe depression. I could only see this being used for less severe/mild depression in very low doses, since it knocks down your energy level. Even after eight hours of sleep, I would still be drowsy throughout the day. I have been on Remeron for over a year, and since then (and with the Vistaril) my condition has improved. After time, the drowsiness begins to wear off and it was about that time that I was prescribed the Vistaril in addition. Has not affected my appetite or weight, and was also used in addtion to therapy (psychiatrist). 
Again, I've been on many different types of antidepressants and have only seen positive results with this drug, though it varies with different people. I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety disorder. Started treatment at fourteen years old, went on Remeron at sixteen and am currently 17 and have begun tapering off medications. Not 100% better, but have reached position where I am able to move on."

If I woke up any earlier, I'd still be dizzy and disoriented.  Its effects on the depression symptoms were hardly noticeable, if at all.  Besides knocking me out cold for half the day, the only other thing it did was give me an insatiable sweet tooth (and a constant craving for oreos of all things).

I too have had all of these side effects. Before starting treatment on Remeron coupled with Lexapro (after trying every other drug on the market and suffering for 5+ years) I truly was ready to die. I had no will to live, I was angry at everything! I truly/sadly was Suicidal and Homocidal.  I would fall asleep within 5-15 minutes of taking it (the reason you take it before bed) no matter what I was doing, EATING, talking, painting my nails. I would also get this feeling of bugs crawling up and down my legs, which was discerning and extremely uncomfortable. And, I too had that INSAITIABLE APPETITE, 30lbs in the first 5months of treatment. That passed. ALL the side effects passed. My appetite is healthier now, but I'm not eating 5 candybars at once now, followed by a couple more! No terrible nightmares, no creepy crawly feelings, no more zombie girl, and I haven't gained any additional weight since the initial 30lbs. I have returned to earth! I have earned my bachelors degree in nursing and have been practicing for 1+ year. I've become married, bought a house, and am excited to live again! The last 4 years have been the best I'd had in a long time. The benefits have far outweighed the temporary side effects. Isn't your happiness worth it?!

HUGE HELP!  only prob is my new INSATIABLE appetite.  at first i thought it was just that my moods were improving (when you don't feel like living, eating just isn't that interesting) but it got worse (CONSTANT thoughts of foods in the fridge, cravings for anything and everything-luckily i also crave raw veggies) & my clothes felt tighter...i believe i have gained 15+ lbs in these last 3.5 weeks...ugh!  i hope the appetite settles down soon, as i don't want to have to stop this med and spiral back down mentally...but i also can't continue putting on weight...how to balance mental health with physical health (weight,etc.)??? overall, though, i am very thankful for this med.

234$Condition: Depression$3/20/2008 4:26:28 PM$Reviewer: NoMoreWorries, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has done wonders for my depression, anxiety, and sleeplessness.  I currently take 30mg with 150mg of Zoloft, and I feel great.  As for side effects, even when I'm full.  Some people complain about being tired the next day, but it's nothing compared to the exhaustion from not sleeping at all.  Overall, this medication is extremely effective.  
235$Condition: Depression$3/3/2008 3:41:58 PM$Reviewer: lady t, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$i think remeron is a great medication for me only because i wanted to gain weight after being 100lbs all my life it really increases the appetite and for that i love this drug didnt do much for my depression.

I do feel better but Im on wellbutrin and abilify so I dont know really whats making me feel better. This med would really work for those who cant eat because all you want to do is eat on this med. The first night I took it I woke up so hungry I could not get enough besides that the med works pretty good.
238$Condition: Depression$3/18/2008 3:48:44 PM$Reviewer: luharrell, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$I feel like I am a zombie all day long. Can barely manage to do the simplest of tasks. I hate the increase in appetite because I had already gained weight. Have not seen much relief from depression. Don't know if I will continue this med because of the side effects. Also very vivid dreams and nightmares.
239$Condition: Depression$3/4/2008 11:47:28 PM$Reviewer: Johanna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$Increased appetite the 1st couple of weeks, no weight gain yet. Dreams arent worse or more frequent than before, but hubby says I talk alot more in my sleep. sleep is better with much less waking in the middle, but tend to oversleep through the alarm. No grogginess during the day. Already have high triglycerides so I'll have to keep an eye on that. So far so good, depression & PTSD improving. will update any changes.

242$Condition: Depression$2/20/2008 10:56:21 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$4$I have only been on Remeron for 5 days, in addition to Effexor, but I feel like a zombie.  It does help me with my sleeplessness and I do get into a deep hard sleep, which is good, but the next day I am so tired and spaced out.  I haven't noticed an improvement in my overall mood yet, maybe it is too soon.  I haven't had any crying spells for a couple of days but I feel like I could at any time.  I don't have any energy or desire to do anything.  My fuse is short and I get upset or angry easily.  I don't have any increased hunger yet so I guess that is good.  I hope all of these symptoms get better or I will have to stop this med. and try something else.

I took 15mg before bed, and felt disconnected for a full day afterwards. I wasn't interested in anything, didn't care about anything. I quit taking it after a week and a half because it was difficult to even get up and go to class.

My fiance has noticed odd dreams as I wake up laughing and are vivid but I do not remember them @all. I am hungry all the time. Not impressed with that. Benefits are far greater than the side effects @this point. On 30mg. 
246$Condition: Depression$1/8/2008 11:17:58 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$2$This medicine more or less put my entire life on hold. I found that I had excessive drowziness, and would often sleep up to 14 hours while using it. I also experienced extreme irritability and anger while I was on it. I don't see how this medicine does anyone any good at all.

Increased my appetite causing weightgain of 30 lbs.  From 124 to 155 lbs in 3 months.  Dr. switched me to Wellbutrin 3 weeks ago and cravings for sugar and alcohol (sugary coolers, I used to hardly drink at all , than wanted 4 a day!), anyways cravings  gone after 2 weeks.

256$Condition: Depression$11/14/2007 9:43:22 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$At first, the side effects were not so bad. I always felt like I had an insatiable appetite and snacks were good enough to minimize it. However, the drowsiness began to greatly affect me during the morning even when I took it early at night. I could not function properly because all I wanted to do was sleep. My thoughts were always clouded. It also made me feel numb. Overall, it did not help me unless feeling numb and stuffing myself is its purpose.

When it was combined with another drug I started gaining weight rapidly.  I don't know if it was weight alone or fluid retention but I became very uncomfortable when I tried to breath.  I felt has though something was pressing against my lungs or I had just competed in a marathon.  It works well, I think I had used up all my luck with this particular drug.

I've always had vivid dreams, now the dreams are extraordinary.  Thankfully, no nightmares.
