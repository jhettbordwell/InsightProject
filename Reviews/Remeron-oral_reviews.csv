1$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/2/2019 8:10:43 PM$Reviewer: Lesfurst, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$3$I was put on 30mg every night while I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt. For the first week I felt like I was in a fog. I continued taking the medication as prescribed and after two weeks I didnâ??t feel like I was in a fog anymore. Itâ??s been two months and Iâ??ve gained 30lbs. Iâ??ve never been this heavy in my life except when I was pregnant. It makes me drowsy but doesnâ??t help me sleep. It also makes my appetite worse after I take it. Going to talk to my psychiatrist about other options.

3$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$11/15/2018 8:14:56 PM$Reviewer: Jared, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been diagnosed with MDD for 6 years. I had tried pretty much every common SSRI and SNRI with minimal results. After beginning to also suffer from severe insomnia my doctor prescribed me this and my life has completely changed. I can sleep now, and feel incredibly at peace and much less negative. I experienced increased appetite at first, which drove me to exercise which made my symptoms even better. So glad to finally have a solution to my condition.
4$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$11/13/2018 12:48:12 PM$Reviewer: TheGuy, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$I suffered from severe insomnia and depression for years. I began taking Remeron and my sleep problems vanished almost overnight. I have experienced a distinct lack of side effects, namely the lack of sex drive that I've seen with other medicines. The weight gain can be an issue, if you're young and have the ability to exercise it is certainly worth it. Absolutely thrilled to feel like myself again.

13$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/1/2016 8:59:04 PM$Reviewer: LS, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Have taken this drug on and off for four years so I have experience with 7.5mg dose, 15mg dose, and withdrawal. On 7.5 I was super sleepy in the morning, almost made it impossible for me to make it to work for my 6 AM shift. Also daydreamed about cookies, candy, root beer, etc. On 15, that sleepiness is totally gone. I still love my cookies (initially started Remeron to help combat an eating disorder and the anxiety that went with it) but I am not daydreaming about them as much. I wake up with tons of energy ready to tackle the day. The withdrawal from either dose is nothing. It's harder to fall asleep but would I still sleep 5  hours a night, so it's not like sleep is impossible while withdrawing. (I'm no longer suffering from depression related insomnia like I was, probably due to the other two AD's as well.) It's been so long since my last MDD episode and I take two other AD's so I can't really say how much it has helped my depression or anxiety. All I know is that I get a solid, restful, rejuvenating, 8 hours of sleep each night, and I don't feel the need to starve myself because food just sounds so good! I would recommend this drug to anyone suffering from either insomnia or an eating disorder. 
14$Condition: Depression$6/16/2016 7:42:20 PM$Reviewer: becccc, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$4$took mirtazapine for 3 months total. 1 month on 15mg, 2 months on 30mg and tried 45mg in between. started helping me right away until 2 months in. it stopped working and gave me extreme anxiety and palpitations, and gained 10-15 lbs in 3 months. doctors said i could stop taking it without tapering because i wasnt on it for long so i did and i ended up in the hospital with nausea, dizziness, sleeping 2 hours a night for a week and a heart rate of 150bpm. my advice: theres way better antidepressants out there that are safer to start and withdrawl from. mirtazapine withdrawl is horrible, and i only took it for 3 months. cant imagine the withdrawl from years of taking it. worked well for the depression but not for anxiety. overall, just try it as a last resort after trying SSRIs.
15$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/6/2016 3:51:38 PM$Reviewer: Ellzeena, 65-74 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$1$5$I began this medication just after losing my daughter, my only child, to mental illness.  I split a 15MG pill in half at bedtime.  Without this drug, I would most likely have not been able to sleep at all and so it saved me from a long stay in a psychiatric hospital.  BUT.... least important, I gained five pounds in less than a year; most important, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OFF THIS DRUG.  Now, I was taking 7.5MG each night and when I stopped taking it I spent three weeks in EMOTIONAL HELL.  Internet gave me info that said there are actual clinics intended ONLY for withdrawal from this drug.  My advice: AVOID IT but, if you are taking it, be very, very careful when withdrawing from it, do it only with psychiatric support.

17$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$5/4/2016 2:29:58 PM$Reviewer: Ned, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$The only two side effects I've had are sleepiness and increased appetite, but I only noticed these side effects in the first month or two of taking Mirtazapine. The benefits of Mirtazapine have DEFINITELY outweighed those two side effects. My depression has been under control since Oct 2011. I take Mirtazapine in combination with Cymbalta and Klonopin for depression and anxiety/panic disorder. One thing to consider is, just like with any depression/anxiety medication, you will need to taper off whenever you and your doctor feel that it's time to stop taking the drug. I've noticed that if I miss a night (always taken just before you want to go to sleep) then I will get slight withdrawal symptoms, but those go away the next night when I take my normal dosage again.

WOW!!!!!  4 months at 15mg and I'm sleeping well and the mood support is fantastic.  It was paired with Clonopin (also excellent) and I can't say enough about this drug.  I believe it is the most overlooked A/D out there.  Helps with sleep, anxiety and mood support.  I have had literally ZERO side effects.  Please note, I have no experience yet tapering off, so I can't comment on that at all yet.

I have suffered from Major Depressive Disorder since I was deployed to the middle east in the Army. I also have General Anxiety Disorder with powerful panic attacks. I have tried to kill myself several times and almost succeeded. But God made it clear to me that it is not my time to go yet. I take 300mg of Venlafaxine Extended 24 hour Release along with Buspar to enhance its effects. I also take 15 mg of Mirtazapine along with it. The combination is infamously called ""The California Rocket Fuel"" and for me personally it truly lives up to its name. On all those 3 drugs alone my depression is only moderately treated BUT the combination of the 3 makes me feel AMAZING!!! I am incredibly HAPPY and I never have anxiety or panic attacks. ALL Antidepressants are different for each person and their unique brain chemistry. It took me years of suffering and trying ALOT of different antidepressants and tolerating their side effects before I finally found what works for me. DONT GIVE UP!!! Their is something out there that WILL work for you!!! Remember taking your own life is NEVER the answer!!! It may seem overwhelming at times but remember you will not always feel that way!!! Its temporary!!! You CAN get better!!! God Bless you all :)"

Definitely makes you sleep.  First time I have slept all night in years and did not realize how much a good night's sleep makes you feel better.  With this drug I have to take one half of a 15mg. Tab because it is so strong.  It is making me eat more too.  My BMI was way too low, but I have always been thin.  My Doctor got concerned because my blood counts are so low and I will be 62 soon.  Wanted to put about 20 lbs. On me and hope it stays.  So far a good experience.

This medication was given to me along with Trazodone and Melatonin.  It sure lets me sleep good.  In fact, I want to sleep ALL the time!  When I get up in the morning, I feel sedated and I feel that way until mid-afternoon. I have been on this medication 14 days and have gained 2 lbs so far.  If I continue to put on the weight, I will protest.  Dr will have to change my medication because gaining weight would create another depressive mood!

It has worked wonders for my panic attacks: I have not had a full-symptom panic attack since starting it. It also puts me to sleep every night which is highly appreciated.

The downside: weight gain. I do not eat more than before I started, and yet I gained weight all year. I'd recommend frequent exercise or reducing your regular calorie intake if you want to avoid gaining weight, even then not sure it's possible. "

I was hungry literally all the time! I am a skinny to muscular guy who tried this drug for about 6 months and I gained over 30 pounds! The only thing that worked is it helped me sleep due to the weight gain. I normally don't eat very much or have an appetite, but I would go out for breakfast and eat a full pancake breakfast followed by more sweet items and I would still be hungry. I felt like a pregnant woman with cravings for constant food. Stay away from this drug! There are too many better alternatives out there.

I have taken most of the drugs prescribed for MDD, BP2 and even a few atypical anti-psychotics.  For the last three years or so, I have been taking a drug 'soup' of Effexor, Remeron and Lamictal.  for the first time in my life (I'm 60), I have been able to function in what I can only guess is some kind of 'normal' way.  If i miss any of my meds, i feel like my head is going to explode and I cannot think logically, concentrate or act rationally.  This combination has saved my life.  I would probably be living on the street if I hadn't found a psychiatrist who was willing to work with me until we found something that worked.  Thanks, MNZ, you know who you are!

Was suffering from serotonin syndrome (shaking, muscle spasams and twitching, tremors, confusion etc.) and didn't realize what was happening.  I was taking Zoloft and tramadol at the same time which caused the too high levels of serotonin in my body.  This can be life threatening so be sure you check what drug interactions there are with any psych meds and tramadol.  I feel like a new person now that it is straightened out.

I've been suffering with major depression, severe panic attacks and agoraphobia for 30 years. Have tried many other antidepressants with no results. It took about a month of horrible side effects but my dr. pleaded with me to give it a try. I am so happy she did! Literally overnight my panic disappeared, I woke up happier than I've ever been in my whole life, I leave the house daily with a smile. This drug is truly a miracle! The only side effect I have now is insatiable appetite but I was grossly underweight so I'm not worried. Also this medicine does not effect sex life like all the other ones do. I can't say enough about remeron, especially for people with severe panic and depression.

44$Condition: Other$6/6/2014 11:20:48 AM$Reviewer: Drb, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I've been on 30mg generic Mirtazipine for about 2 years after a depressive event.  I used to think that I just didn't need much sleep and would average between 4 and 6 hours of very light sleep each night.  With the onset of my depression I was getting only 2-3 hours of sleep each night.  My Dr started me on 30mg and the first night I slept for 16 hours straight.  Fortunately this was on a weekend and the next night I again slept for over 12 hours.  My depression was linked to a stressful event and I have recovered from that so I don't know what part the remeron played in my recovery but I love the change it has made in my sleep pattern.  I can depend on the 30mg to give me a sound 8 hours of sleep each night.  I set the alarm on my phone to remind me each evening at 7:30 to take the med.   About 2 hours later I am feeling sleepy and easily fall asleep without tossing and turning or my mind racing.  I especially like that if I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I can quickly go back to sleep.  When I get up at 6:00 in the morning I can still feel the effect of the med but by 7:30 the effects have completely worn off and I am clear-headed the rest of the day and never feel drowsy after lunch.  For me remeron has worked wonderfully to give me a normal sleep pattern and no side effects of weight gain.  I do exercise daily and haven't changed my eating habits since starting remeron.  Great drug in my opinion

I had some traumas back in 1997, and had to be on Ativan, Zoloft, Clonazapam, Remeron, Lexapro, etc.(not all at the same time) trying to get stabilized I had panic attacks and sleep problems often for 10 years. Finally in 2010, my doctor prescribed a combination of Remeron 30 mg, and Celexa 20 mg. That has worked very well now for 4 years. I sleep well, and have mild anxiety attacks maybe 2 or 3 times a year. I carry a Rx of Lorazapam .5 mg with me all the time to stop a panic attack if needed, but rarely have to take it. My appetite is good, I am 5'10"" and weigh 130 lbs. I have tried to taper off of my meds very slowly several times, but always had bad panic attacks when meds got down to about half. So I guess it is a necessity for me. And No, I have never used alcohol or tobacco, or any other substance abuse. And I have been a vegetarian all my life. "

I started taking 15mg but was still having some symptoms and asked my dr to up my dose a little so I am now taking 30 mg and very please. I did have strange dreams a lot at first now they are occasional. I did gain weight but seeing that I was 92 pounds(I am 5'7) this was a good side effect.

It worked initially, but then after a month the side effects were awful. I was a zombie and felt completely bizarre and out of reality. I kept telling my psychiatrist that I felt very weird and uncomfortable and she just blew it off. It puts you to sleep very fast, but chemically it is similar to dipenhydramine, and it lasts a LONG time. This medication was an absolute nightmare for me. I finally found out from my PSY-D that MANY patients have lots of problems with Remeron and do not tolerate it well. It took over a month after discontinuing this drug to feel normal again. You will snore, have intense munchies, and feel like you have had a lobotomy on this drug. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!
60$Condition: Other$2/13/2014 7:34:52 PM$Reviewer: UnderControl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$After trying most SSIR's on the market, between 2000-2010, Remeron has proven to be the best and only drug I can tolerate and rely on for acceptable and sufficent relief from: 1. Depression, 2. Major Depressive Episodes, 3. PTSD and 4. Nausea associated with anxiety.  I had horrible side effects from Buspar, Wellbutrin, Xanax, Prozac & Zoloft.  I believe this drug is safe, the side effects are actually minimal, and it's an overall superior drug in this class.  It has subsided suicidal thoughts.  Slight weight gain is annoying but I wouldn't trade it less effective & more commonly prescribed drugs.  Remeron is an older (tried and true) drug, and not widely precribed anymore which I think is a shame, considering it's effectiveness.  It doesn't need a 'booster' drug and may help bring back an appetite to those who suffer from depression/anxiety related episodes.  It's off label use for PTSD has had a mild (good) effect on me but not significant enough to use for that purpose alone.  Best wishes to those wanting relief, who need & deserve relief, and try it based on this recommendation, coming from over a decade of experience with taking the small 30 mg. pill at bedtime - which also helps insomnia!

He thought that it may help me with my appetite (I weighed 91 pounds at 5'6). We started at 15 mg and three days later, upped to 30 mg.
Within days, I felt an increase in my motivation and my will to get things done. I generally felt happier. The first days of taking this medication, I even felt slightly euphoric.

Before beginning this medication, I had read reviews about it and was pretty worried from what I read. However, I've experienced only a very light change in my weight. I've had little to no side effects and I am not drowsy after I wake up.

I've personally benefitted quite a bit from this med and have experienced only one awkward side effect: it has caused my breasts to often be lumpy and twice their usual size. One is also a little larger than the other but it's barely noticeable.
Working great for my depression and lack of motivation,."

For me, this drug was a nightmare. I had researched medications to combat anxiety-based insomnia and thought this was going to be the solution -- one pill to counter depression/anxiety and insomnia. This wasn't the case for me. When I took the lowest dosage (15mg) I experienced heart flutters and severe dizziness (think being on top of a roller coaster or how you feel with a panic/anxiety attack), at odd intervals -- every 30 minutes or so, it would last a minute, then stop, then repeat in another 30 or so minutes. It also knocked me out. Remeron is incredibly effective for sleep, in fact I was still stoned the next day nearly 16 hours later. And that was at the lowest dosage. I honestly don't know how people function on this drug, I couldn't. Bad experience for me. But again, everyone's body chemistry is different, so what didn't work for me, may work for you. After my experiences with this drug, I got off of it immediately and went to my doctor who prescribed another drug (pristiq for anxiety/depression and oxazepam for insomnia -- both working exceptionally well for me).

I could not wait to go to bed each day because I knew I would get the best sleep I ever had each night.  But, it caused horrible dreams and I sometimes woke my husband up by hitting him.  I didn't even know I was doing that.  Also, I gained 10 lbs in 1 week while using this.  It made me soooo hungry and I could not stop myself from eating.  It made me crave sweets like crazy.  I didn't realize that a drug could make food be the only thing on my mind 24/7.  So after the second week and 15 lbs. later I gave up my best sleep ever and disposed of the rest of my script.  I specifically asked my doctor to not put me on a medication that would cause me to gain weight, but she did and I am having the hardest time ever trying to loose it.  I am furious over that and my sleep still suffers.  NO MORE REMERON for me!!!!!  BEWARE:  AFTER RESEARCHING THIS MEDICATION I LEARNED THAT SOME DOCTORS USE THIS TO MAKE THEIR PATIENTS GAIN WEIGHT!

I have never felt stranger or more unstable while on this drug. I experienced mood swings, intense anxiety, panic attacks,weight gain, and the absence of my menstrual cycle. As soon as I stopped taking it, my anxiety decreased, my menstrual cycle came, and the panic attacks decreased. Would NOT recommend this drug to anyone who is sensitive to drugs in general or is looking for anxiety relief. I miss sleeping, which is the only thing it helped me do, but the side effects were NOT worth it. I did not feel depressed whatsoever before taking this drug but did while taking it.

For me it was poison, and after 3 months I insisted on going back to Zoloft, the only one that has worked for me, although I can't sleep well
when I am taking it. To counteract this I was given Ambien Controlled Release and a low dosage of Klonopin/Clonazepan to take before going to sleep.

Mirtazapine is a differant type, and it has worked great for me.  I was having insomnia and very little appetite, and was getting extremely thin.  My sleep has returned to a normal 8 hrs. and my appetite is normal.  I was having panic attacks, which stopped the first night I started taking this medication.  I was also having much anxiety,  which I took Xanax for.  The dr. Prescribed Clonazepam as a supplement to replace the xanax.  I stopped needing the Xanax immediately, and take .5mg of Clonazepam as needed to supplement the Mirtazapine.  I am very happy I kept trying until I found something that was right for my body chemistry, as the SSRI's were not.  The clonazepam can be taken long term if needed without getting dependent on it.

I can't say when I have had more calmness and peace in my day. I do take 1/2 of 15mg in the morning and 1/2 in evening so combat the side effect of sleepiness. I have to say that I am a new person; amazing how severe depression can totally change the real you. In the past I have tried other meds for depression and to be quite honest, there would be days I would forget to take my meds  but with Remeron having made so much difference to me, I have a daily reminder to take it because I feel so alive. I do agree this drug (like most serotonin lifting antidepressants)does increase appetite which I hope will even out after awhile. I do contribute appetite and cravings for sweets to be a side effect, as well as the fact that I have stopped drinking alcohol completely. I think my body is craving the sugar I was getting through alcohol. But feeling better mentally, I have an exercise plan in place and will try to keep the weight gain at bay. I thank God for all he is doing for me, including put the doctor in my path who knew what I needed. Remeron has been a blessing.

This time I have severe insomnia vs the first where I slept all the time. Due to my success with Effexor the first time, I felt it necessary to stay with the same class of drugs. Due to the insomnia, I switched to remeron. This medicine has been extremely beneficial in eliminating the insomnia and preventing the lack of concentration. My mood is better. Overall, I am reporting improvement from this medicine. I agree that it increases your appetite but all medicines increasing levels of serotonin do. If you stick to a strict diet regimen, the weight gain will not be as pronouned.

Prescribed Anafranil (clomipramine), hits both nor adrenaline and serotonin. wonderful response but awful sid effects worst being excessive face sweating, literally rivers running down my face. Had to discontinue. Suffered remitant bouts of depression but battled thorugh with support of family. Went back on Anafranil in 2000 due to severe attack. Lifted depression but had to stop due to side effects, I'm a Head Teacher of a school. This year my wife had an affair and this resulted in a severe depression. Had to leave home after 24 years of marriage, 3 kids. Thought the world was going to end. Went to docs, prescribed fluoxetine. On it for 4 months, did a little but not enough. Did my own research and persuaded dr to prescribe mirtazapine as it hits two transmitters same as Anafranil but with less side effects. On 15mg for one week and 30mg for the last two weeks. The effect has been amazing. For me its been a wonder drug. I hope it continues to work as for the first time for years I feel like me. The wife's affair is still going on although she denies it, I've confronted him and he has admitted it.  Life is not good but thanks to mirtazapine I think I can cope with almost anything.

I'm taking it to help me gain weight. However, the side effects are so terrible that I can't stand it. I'm not a depressed person by nature but I am now that I'm taking this drug. I'm dizzy, have dry mouth, very drowsy and have no interest in anything, and I have a headache. All I want to do is sleep. To add to that, I'm constipated. This is just awful. I'm calling my doctor and telling him I want off this drug.

BUT nope this was awful for me :(   first few days was just okay did after taking it I felt sleepy an when I did wake up man I was groggy ALL day :-(   . Worst part was I noticed I felt so hungery not stop an wanted to just eat!! Was not good cause I should tell I was putting pounds on but I always felt like I haven't eatin.  Well after only 5 weeks being on it went for a check up an found it made me gain 7 pounds OMG.  I was shocked an wanted off it right then!!!   So I would say if you don't wanna gain weight or if extra weight gain will make other health problems worst for you, Then I would stay away from this Drug!!!!!!!

Oh and for anyone starting remeron, start SLOW don't take the whole dose for the first 6 days go up slowly and it isn't as bad! I started off on 7 mg for 2 days then went up to 10 mg for 2 days then to 15mg so on. Hope this helps!

The anxiety seems to cause the depression in my case. I have been on the meds for about a year now, I gained weight (which i needed) and I've been pretty happy. I have been able to travel overseas and I took a very large course load in college this past Spring! I haven't worked since I've been on this particular pill, but I am working with my therapist to get to where i feel confident again. I highly recommend this to people who are underweight, it increases your appetite to a normal appetite level, so you are actually able to put on (and keep on) weight if needed!!

121$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$6/24/2012 11:53:35 AM$Reviewer: Fitnesswoman, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$"I have been taking this medication for 2weeks and it really does make you want to eat just about everything but with working out i think i will be okay plus i was underweight so the gaining of a few extra pounds is okay for me.
The one bad side thing that i hope goes after time is the horrific nightmares OH MY GOSH those dreams are awful and i do mean awful a few times i woke up crying because the dreams were just that horrific.
I will ask my doctor if those bad dreams will go but apart from that it stops my constant worrying.
Of course i still worry about the normal things in life but i am able to sleep about 8hrs a night rather than 2hrs a night like i did before.
My doctor put me on 30mg and told me to take half for the first then told me to start taking the full 30mg after a week.
But when i took the whole 30mg the dreams got more horrific so i just take half which is 7.5mg.
It's important to be careful what you buy when getting your groceries or you will gain a lot of weight while taking these pills but overall i think they have helped me with less worrying.
Peace to you all and hope you all have a happy life :)"

This aided sleep, however it the drowsiness lasted for part of the next day, coffee helped.

Thankfully the drowsiness tends to disappear after a while.

I am now at 45 mg, and it only seems to give a good antidepressant response when combined with prozac (fluoxetine). Neither agent alone works very well, but together they form a potent antidepressant that works for me.

Now, 5 months later, I'm still trying to lose the excess weight. I took it knowing of this possible side effect, but I thought that I might be able to control the weight gain, but I was not prepared for the incredibly voracious appetite that the drug created. I thought about food constantly, and I could not feel when I was full until my stomach actually hurt from overeating. I probably would have gained 100 lbs. had I continued taking the drug. I would never take this medication again unless I planned to commit suicide and no other antidepressants existed.

After having 5 grandparents die in 4 years, this was finally diagnosed.  Started with 15 mg and moved to 7.5 mg after a 1 1/2 years due to ""hangover"" symptom.  Have been on it for about 5 years now and just now reading reviews.  Weight gain has been the problem for me, after blowing my knee out from cycling.  But, now it is just the motivation factor that I need to work on in the future.  You have to be conscious of the foods you are buying and what you are eating.  I know this from experience and know what needs to be done to render it.  The sleep that I have gotten has been GREAT! After not sleeping for more than 3-4 hours a night for 4 years, I average about 8 hours a night, setting two alarms to get up by in morning.  Also, 5-hour energy shots have been a life-saver without adding calories. Now that I know others are having problems with the weight gain, I can focus more on my eating habits..."

Last year, Zoloft quit helping with my depression and I was suffering.  I tried a few alternate anti-depressants with no success.  However, ffter taking Remeron for 2 days, I was back to my old self and able to sleep.  The most amazing aspect is that I have had no anxiety or panic attacks at all.  I've had anxiety for so long that I had forgotten how peaceful I could feel.  I love Remeron but it does make me sleepy during the day.  My MD, is going to up my dose to 45mg from 30 mg. to see if that will help with the sleepiness.  I haven't had any weight gain or food cravings.

At the time I really needed them, I had no access to them. I called my dr. and he was on vacation and the dr filling in would not give me an emergency prescription. I nearly lost it...mentally! My husband was released in six days and is doing great. Better than expected, but that night, I took my remeron, and regained my sanity overnight. I slept like a baby.

I have tried all of the over the counter and prescribed medicines and either they worked once, I got used to it, they didn't work at all or I had an allergic reaction/severe side effect to it. I actually get a full nights sleep now! The only negative thing about remeron is that if you don’t go to bed soon after it kicks in is that you want to eat. I mean a lot! So, I go to bed before I start eating everything in my fridge or cabinets.

Remeron is the generic form of Mirtazapine. I was told by my old psychiatrist who is also a dr of pharmacology that GENERIC MEDICATIONS ARE NOT CHEMICALLY THE SAME AS THE BRAND NAME. An example I lived thru--I was on Prozac for many years which became generic.  I bombed out at an all time low on fluoxetine (gen.Prozac), lost my job cuz of it, went to my psychi. who said all her patients bombed on on the generic and all had to be changed to either the brand name only or an entirely different anti-depressant.  GENERICS SUK, if you can afford the brand name, I suggest you stick with them.  That's probably why remeron didn't work for me.

I was allergic to most foods and got migraines from wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, about everything that you can eat that makes life worth living, as well as the usual environmentals. Except for chocolate which is instant, Food allergies are easy to miss as triggers. You eat something with flour in it (the crouton the waitress neglected to pick out of your salad for example) and 2 days later a crippling migraine comes over the hill.  By the time I was at 30 mg I started to notice I was getting a pass or maybe only a mild episode where I had every right to expect worse. At 45 mg I realized I was experiencing the change we were looking for for 2 years of drug experimentation had arrived--in a drug the dr. had not event expected to work. 

I actually loved the dreams.  He kept asking me about depression and I would say ""no more than anyone having a migraine 2 or 3 times a week.""  But I have always liked what was in my head and even if it was scary or horrifying, I had the capacity to wake up in the morning and say ""boy am I glad that was just a dream. don't get me wrong. I have had anxiety issues for which I had to take zoloft (now citalopram, the cheaper version).
I would like to go down on the remeron, simply because I do not want to be an ""uninsurable"" with a previous condition which migraines are if they are under control with more than 3 drugs. I still have rescue meds and topomax. I still have allergies, but the food ALLERGIES  DISAPPEARED WITH REMERON. Or rather as my doctor put it, th e part of my brain that interpreted that as pain disconnected from the pain source--I guess that would apply to depression too."

I weighed 134 lbs in July, and got on the scale in early January and I weighed 166 lbs. I have been off this med for 2 weeks and my doctor and my family have been helping me monitor my mood.

I started having panic attacks and had total loss of appetite (nervous stomach). I lost about 15 lbs. in 2 mths.  My dr. prescribed Remeron, I started taking 7.5 mg (1/2 tablet) about a month ago and it was helped immeasurably. Anxiety is much improved (although at work I still get heart palpatations, etc.).  My appetite is much better, stomach feels fine and most importantly my sleep has greatly improved.  Now that I've gone through a long stretch of sleep problems I know how vital it is to having a good frame of mind, energy and a positive outlook.  I can't underestimate how important getting a good night's sleep is.   I will say the only side effect I don't like is at times I feel a little dizzy and light headed.  On a couple of occasions I skipped taking it for a day or two and I immediately noticed I didn't have the dizziness.  I highly recommend Remeron for anxiety and insomnia.  I don't have depression so can't say how well it works for it.

Before, I was prescribed a 150 mg daily dose of trazodone before going to bed to help me sleep.  I usually took 75mg to 150mg.  However, it didn't seem to work at all for sleep.  Just okay for depression.  First night of Remeron didn't help at all, either.  Took a couple of hours to feel drowsy and had light, broken sleep afterward.  Still hopeful, though.  I could take an Ambien CR 12.5 mg but I'm trying not to take them that often as they are expensive.  Time will tell.  Not sure of how it will work for my depression.

Pros:  The drug works. It really does. I tried Lexapro and Pristiq with no success. Third try was Remeron and it worked!  I sleep all the way through the night. No waking up every few hours because it knocks you out.  I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to conquer my day without being depressed.
Cons:  I gained 10-15 pounds in the first few months.  Not to defend this side effect, but if you know in advance that you will gain weight, then start eating healthier and exercising. In my case, since I was no longer depressed, I had the motivation to exercise and lose it.  Between month 3 and now, I've since lost all that weight.  Another con was feeling drowsy for the first week.  You should start to feel very normal after the first few days.  Just plan to start taking on a Thursday or Friday so you that you spend your weekend being lazy. "

I'd been through nearly every anti-depressant you can name, and though a not so pleasant experience at Kaiser P - even some anti-psychotics as my Psych told me ""it's not that your psychotic, you just have some delusional thoughts..."".  I used to have terrible anxiety and depression - my ""delusional thoughts"" were my thinking that everybody in public was staring at me and knew that I was ""crazy"".  I became agoraphobic - and nothing Kaiser tried was working for me.  When I had lost everything (job, home, etc.) - I went to a low/no income health care center, where I finally got a GREAT team of doctors.  My psych put me on Remeron, first at 15mg/day and then up to 30 - that's when my I finally started gaining control back over my life.  Remeron is by far the best solution (IMHO) for Major Depressive Disorder with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It abolished the depression, decreased my anxiety to the point that my anxiety medication was finally strong enough to do its job.  I went from not being able to leave my home to getting a good job, having a much more enjoyable marriage, and loving/living my life!  If you've been through a similar experience or have the same diagnosis and can't tolerate the side effects of SSRI's - I would highly recommend giving this medication a chance.  It's so amazing what the right medicine can do for a patient who has been through all the wrong ones.  There should be more press coverage and certainly more patients on this safe and effective medication.  SSRI's - killed my sex drive.  Wellbutrin - gave me a grand mal seizure. Remeron - saved my life, and my marriage."

Since the increased dosage to 30mg, I have been having some balance problems, and now blood tests have shown that my blood counts are low and I have a iron deficiency. Dr. lowered med from 30mg to 15mg and told to eat more foods that have iron. This med keeps your mouth extremely dry and you need to carry water with you where ever you go. I have noticed that my feet and hands have swelled and I've gained 25lbs. Dr. said she would probably have to change my meds. I am also taking 2 - 20mg generic form of Paxil per day also. Prior to the mirtazapine, I was taking Paxil CR 75mg per day. I really hoped that this med would be beneficial to me, which it has been.

It was a God send, let me sleep which definitely helped with getting clear of constant depression.  After 2 months, I began having very jittery legs at night, for 2 hours, keeping me awake then, but after that, would sleep soundly again.  I found that by cutting the dosage in half the jitters stopped and I still slept okay. Also, remeron gave a bothersome weight gain on abdomen and gut which I hate, can't get rid of it.  After 6 months, I very gradually went off remeron, was off 2 weeks, but now the inability to stay sleeping has returned.  So, I guess I'll have to get back on it, which makes me sad as I don't like to be on drugs, especially something that puts on unnecessary weight.  But, sleep is extremely important, so I guess I'll just have to live with a pot belly. Another reason I wanted to stop remeron is because it made my muscles and joints feel stiff and achy.  I felt older than I am.

So now I've started 15 mg. of Mirtzapine.  The first night I took a whole pill and slept all night and all the next day--it was awful.  But my doc had warned me and said to take half, if that happened.  The half pill works, but after about a week (today) I'm going to try taking a whole one again.  I'm an artist and a writer and haven't done any creative work in a year...the only thing Welbutrin didn't cure...but this week I've been painting AND writing, so I'm excited about this combo.

It really helped me a lot. The best part is it makes you happy and sleepy, so u just take it when you are ready for bed in the next half hour or so.It also has antihistamine properties, so I no longer take allergy pills. Very little in the way of side effects.  A little bit of nightmares in the beginning or  when adjusting to a higher dose. Before Remeron I tried different SSRI's and SNRI'S but they killed my sex drive and made me super constipated. I started at 15 mg slowly went up to 30mg after a while. Truly a wonder drug for me. Don't give up on antidepressants until you've tried Remeron!

I take the 45 mg. dose. It helps me fall asleep pretty quick but, before I fall asleep, I get muscle twitches. There have even been occations where I have kicked my wife in my sleep. I also take Vicodin ES for a disk I had replaced in my neck, Buspar, and Prozac. I'm not sure if the twitches are from either of these or the Remeron, like some have reviewed in the past. Overall, other than the twitches and kicks, I am pretty well satisfied with Remeron.

In the beginning however I did NOT like the side effects. The first night I took it I woke up feeling like  zombie. I could barely function throughout that first day and I couldnt eat enough food to fill me up. I swear I ate for hours at a time. I have always been a skinny person and I never had problems with gaining weight in the past. I have noticed now that Ive been on this drug that I have put on a few pounds. However the crazy side effects I experienced in the beginning are not really an issue for me anymore. Im glad I didnt just abrubtly stop after taking my first dose because I realy did need to let my body learn to adjust to this medication. So as of right now I can honestly say that my anxiety is a small fraction of what it used to be and Remeron does seem to be helping.

251$Condition: Other$3/19/2010 2:44:12 AM$Reviewer: none, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$1$After taking remeron a few years ago with limited effectiveness but no side effects my doc prescribed it again after trying other anti-depressants. I do suffer depression but also anorexia and PTSD type of symptoms/anxiety. I take 45mg of it along with 10mg diazepam at night. I am having horrific nightmares, waking 4 or 5 times a night and am exhausted but too afraid to sleep despite the diazepam. I asked the doctor if it could be a side effect of the drug at the last apt. and he shrugged and said 'possibly' but its not serious. When I looked it up I was shocked to see how many others have had similar reactions (some not so severe)and I have just phoned the doc to ask him why he didn't tell me and why he isn't listening to how seriously this is affecting me (just when I was starting to recover). He has suggested simply taking 15mg of DOrmicum (for insomnia) so I sleep! The whole plan for me has been to reduce medication gradually (I was taking a number of different medications) and replace them with remeron. TO simply 'throw' more meds at the problem seems so wrong. I was doing fairly well on FLuoxetine, he doesn't like giving it because he's afraid I'll lose weight but as anyone with anorexia knows it isn't appetite that will cause weight gain or loss. I have had no change in weight with increased appetite from remeron or decreased appetitie from Prozac. I have agreed to give the sleeping tablets a try for a few days to see if the nightmares stop but if not I will refuse to take this medication anymore and will have to review it anyway as I don't want to remain on sleeping tablets and have already been taking remeron for long enough for this side effect to have subsided if it was going to. It is pulling me back into worsening symptoms and suicidal thoughts. I am thankful to have a husband who is aware of what is going on and can keep watch!

It helped with generalized anxiety quite a lot, but did not help with social anxiety. I didn't notice much antidepressant effect. Even though this medication did not feel generally activating I developed agoraphobia and experienced panic attacks while taking this medication (which improved upon cessation). This may have been due to the norepinephrine effect. It helped alot with sleep, weight gain, and appetite. There were no sexual side effects and I found it easy to discontinue the medication.

I was extremely groggy the next morning and I took the medication at 7:30pm the evening prior. Then, the next day I was eating EVERYTHING in sight. I'm a size 4 and don't have an unusual eating habit, but I ate so much that day (three trips to the office vending machine), that by the end of the day my stomache was very distended. And I was still hungry. 
Needless to say, I will not use this drug again. The side effects outweigh the benefits in my case."

I must admit it worked well at the beginning and I gained a well needed 20 pounds which I have lost along with my appetite after it ""pooped-out"" two and half years ago. My psychiatrist wants to add another anti-depressant but I refuse and he will not hear of it. Tried Cipralex 10 mg and it made me feel awful: burning sensation in digestive tract,sore belly,nausea,no appetite. I stopped after one pill. I feel  angry,frustrated,inadequate,I hate myself and I hate to get up in the morning to face another day of misery. My anxiety level is at a record high and I feel that my life is not worth living. When you feel better,are you not supposed to stop taking those mind -altering drugs? I am beginning to think that psychiatrists are only drug pushers. I want out and be my old happy self again before I got depressed!!!I cannot make important decisions and I am totally overwhelmed by any little problem. More drugs will not benefit,of that I am convinced! Psychiatry is not a science. On top of that,I have developed a stage 3 chronic kidney disease and have to check my creatinine level every 3 months and I blame Remeron for that! Thanks Remeron but no more!!!!!!"

282$Condition: Other$12/9/2009 11:26:25 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$"I'm on Remeron (actually generic Mirtazapine) for depression, sleep issues and anxiety in the aftermath of a prostate cancer diagnosis (which has been successfully resolved by surgery).  Additionally, my p-doc put me on it to help me taper from low level doses of Valium and Ambien, which I started when the cancer diagnosis was made.  The quantities of valium and ambien I'm on are very low (3mg/day and 5mg/every other day respectively), but I'm also a recovering alcoholic with 10 years sobriety and my addictive personality was giving me trouble in getting off these drugs now that the cancer-associated anxiety is somewhat less.
  Anyhow, I'm in my 4th week of treatment and I take 15 mg. Mirtazapine nightly.
It has been a significant aid to sleep and I
am now about to taper the Ambien to 2.5 mg every other night.
  The Mirtazapine has brought a general, but significant lessening of my anxiety. So far, its effects on my depression have been less, although also noticeable. I may need to ramp up to 22.5 mg or even 30, but need to discuss that with the doc first, of course.
  There has been some weight gain, perhaps 3-5 lb. so far and it takes a while to wake up in the mornings and become lucid. Maybe this will pass with some time.  
  Over the years, I've been on a number of different meds for depression and anxiety, including Zoloft, Luvox and Lexapro. As well as combined Lexapro/Buspar therapy to also address anxiety. None of them have ever done much for me. Low levels of valium (no more than 4mg/day) have been the only med that has ever helped my anxiety.  This seems to be changing and Mirtazapine may be ""the"" med that best fits and addresses my combined anxiety/depression issues.  That's good news.  I'll need to do some dose tinkering in consultation with my p-doc as the valium and ambien go away. But I'm pretty optimistic that we may finally have found the wrench that fits my bolt head...:)

My mom recently passed away from brain cancer and I have been having some issues with sleep and slight depression as of recent. This has helped me tremendously. I can actually sleep at night and it is a deep, relaxing sleep.

The only down side to it is that if someone wakes me up in the night by calling me or not waking me up completely, I kinda sleep talk. I don't remember even being awake. I have also written some pretty deep poetry in my sleep. I am not a writer, so it is a little out of the ordinary, but it is all good.

He is in the treatment facility right now and this is the med they are giving him.  I can NOT believe the difference in his personality, interaction, and conversation skills.  He actually has EMOTION on his face now (before his face was just blank), he is interacting WELL w/ everyone in the facility (before he would have just stayed in his room), and he is actually having LONG CONVERSATIONS (before he would sit in a corner and rebuke anyone who attempted to engage him in coversation).  They have him on a low dose, but it seems to be working.  The doctor is talking about increasing his dosage just to see how he does, but I'm going to tell him to tell the doc that he is HAPPY with the current dose.  He is not having ANY side effects at all.  We were on our way to divorce before he sought this help.....this medication may just give me the man I always thought I'd married.

I also take 300 mg. of Effexor XR each day, and my doctor said that the combination of Effexor and Remeron is known to be a potent one in fighting depression, so she raised the Remeron dosage to 30 mg. I thought the sedative effects would go away with the higher dose, but I'm still sleeping peacefully almost every single night. I'm really hoping that the higher dose will ""kick in"" and relieve me of this horrible depression that has plagued me for so long now. That would be wonderful indeed."

I was hung over all day, and sometimes almost fell asleep during my long expressway commute. At work I was flat, no anxiety, but no affect, almost like a zombie. When I told my psychiatrist he increased the dosage, telling me the side effects of flatness and weight-gain would go away. Although this sounded counter-intuitive, I was so desperate that I agreed. After 8 weeks on it, I began to notice another problem: it interfered with my gross motor skills. I kept stumbling and falling down. That was the end of Remeron for me. I asked my doctor to put me back on Zoloft, which had made me feel like myself, but had the side effect of insomnia. He put me on Ambien Controlled Release and Klonopin (Clonazepan) for sleep. This has worked very well and I am still taking them, including 50 mg. of Zoloft. I did stop taking Zoloft for a while, but my anxiety and depression came back slightly---though never as dreadful as when I felt suicidal---and I am coping w/my life. I am an older student getting a second post-grad degree, and I was able to do all the paper-work to get into a top-notch school.
This is in high contrast to lying in bed unable to sleep or take care of anything in my daily life. Oh, I did have to resign from my teaching job after coping w/depression for a year on numerous drugs, which didn't work. "

It's older, but it worked better for me than the newer SSRI's everyone raved about. They were terrible for me. The only odd thing about Remeron was that it made me very sleepy in lower doses, but not in larger doses. Took it in conjunction with Wellbutrin, which was okay too, but probably should have just stuck with the Remeron. Can't even remember why I went off it. Doctor's recommendation... 
The worst part of beginning or ending anything was weaning myself off the previous one, waiting a week or so, then titrating up on the new one until at a therapeutic dose...and suffering in the meantime. Docs are only available by voicemail. Sucks."

Mild reduction in sex drive. I have had two nights, a month apart, of unexplained severe itching, especially in the legs. Not sure if this is from the drug, but I have read it can cause skin rash, although I did not have a rash.

I would say that Remeron worked the best.  Calmed me down and ahhh, getting some good sleep was nice.  After awhile, you do get sluggish and sometimes on weekends, will take long naps.  Celexa and Zoloft gave me gastric/intestional problems and Zoloft also gave me headaches.  Whenever you stop taking any of these meds, check with your doctor and get off SLOWLY.  The slower the better to avoid withdrawal sysmptoms.  Best of luck!

I have taken most depression meds for depression, most benzodiazepine meds for anxiety and most hypnotics and non-hypnotics for insomnia. Non of them will gave me or will give you the beneficial stage 3 & 4 recuperative sleep that you need. Lexapro for 2.5 years fixed the depression and anxiety but the insomnia never went away. My doctor put me on 15 mg of Remeron and after 2 weeks I felt as though I was 10 years younger. The great sleep I now get makes me feel fantastic during the day. It does take 2 full weeks to kick in though. It is the only med I have taken that dramatically improved my sleep architecture, meaning that I now get to stage 3 and 4 whereas previously I hadn't attained in about 5 years. A great nights sleep also helps keep any depression and anxiety away. I wish that this was the first med I was prescribed, it would have saved me a lot of wear and tear on my mind and body. If you have trouble sleeping I urge you to ask your doctor about this med. It has changed my life.

I started taking 15mg for 6 weeks, then increased dose to 30mg. After initial adjustment, the medication has helped with sleep, depression and anxiety. I have had no panic attacks, and anxiety levels have returned to normal. This medication has helped get me back on track after some extreme stressful situations.

All of the SSRIs had the sexual side effects on me and Wellbutrin had no effect on me.  When my doctor first prescribed this I did not really have much faith and I was nervous from all of the negative reviews on here.  On the first day I was sooo tired and sooo zoned out that I could not function.  I was on 15mg so I went back to 7.5 and I was fine and then a few days later I was up to 15mg again and I felt the low mood and anxiety diminish which was amazing to me.  It was effective for me almost 3 days after starting it.  Now, the reasons I only have it 3 stars for my satisfaction level is because I gained 5 lbs in this first two week period.  I have to say that I eat ALOT of fried sugary food and so as of today I am going to buy a scale and try to eat healthier and see what happens.  I really like the effect because it has really diminished my obsessive thoughts...I hope I don't gain 100lbs :)

After taking the first dose I had trouble getting to sleep and felt like I had restless leg syndrome.  After that subsided, I began to have really strange dreams, was constantly irritable, moody and developed a left eye twitch.  At times, I also felt like I was seeing things in a surreal way.  I also felt like I had no emotions.  I felt like a zombie. It did help me sleep through the night but I couldn't appreciate how it made me feel during the day.  I called my Doctor after being on it for about two weeks and requested to go back on Zoloft.  After this experience, I think I can handle the side effects that at first I thought were difficult to deal with (hair loss, waking up through the night).

388$Condition: Depression$9/8/2008 4:19:15 PM$Reviewer: samantha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$2$"I was prescribed this for anxiety and depression [more like depression as a result of too many panic attacks]. It made me a total zombie. I could barely complete sentences the first 2 weeks. It made me very tired and I could NOT STOP eating! Higher doses supposedly give you less side effects, so I went up to 30mg. One night I forgot to take my meds so I took them at 5 am. When I got up at 8am, I fainted in my bathroom. It was really scary!!!! Also, I have gained 10-15 pounds over the last few months. However, after the first few weeks the sleepiness and fogginess subsided.

Yes, I feel better, but I also take Celexa. Also my anxiety has lessened, so there's less to be depressed about. I am going off of Remeron now—mostly because I can't stand the weight gain.

It was and is a Godsend for me. I have recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and my Dr prescribed Lyrica. The combination of Remeron and Lyrica proved to be dangerous for me - I passed out and fell into a chair, while trying to get back to bed after going to the bathroom one night about 2 weeks into taking both medication. I lay where I fell for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Turned out I had broke all the little bones in the upper part of my cheek on the left side. So my Dr changed my medication for depression to Elavil. I will be talking to my Dr to change me back to the Remeron, as I can not take Lyrica of Cymbalta for my Firbo. - I am one of the 15% who gets increased paing on these meds. I much prefer the Remeron, as it also helps several other symptems of Fibro. ie; IBS,anxiety, Also Elavil caused me to crave sweets and carbhydrates and I have gained 15# and my LDL Cholestrol and Triglycerides have risen a lot. I never had these problems on Remeron. and see from reading other articles on this site, Remeron helps with these conditions also. I also slept MUCH better on Remeron! I really like how I feel, and how I sleep on this med. and would recommened that you give it a try if you have any of the deseases it helps treat.

393$Condition: Depression$8/14/2008 10:24:10 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$3$5$Remeron was a life saver for me, literally.  I was in a severe depression, tried several other medications (that were not effective) and finally took remeron.  I felt better within a few days of taking the medication.  The only adverse side effect was that I gained weight taking the drug.  However, I have since stopped taking the medication and am losing the weight.  
394$Condition: Depression$8/3/2008 11:58:09 AM$Reviewer: Jane, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"Remeron has been the only antidepressant that hasn't caused major negative side effects in my case. I take it in addition to Vistaril, and though the effects are very sedating, I think it's a plus in cases of severe depression. I could only see this being used for less severe/mild depression in very low doses, since it knocks down your energy level. Even after eight hours of sleep, I would still be drowsy throughout the day. I have been on Remeron for over a year, and since then (and with the Vistaril) my condition has improved. After time, the drowsiness begins to wear off and it was about that time that I was prescribed the Vistaril in addition. Has not affected my appetite or weight, and was also used in addtion to therapy (psychiatrist). 
Again, I've been on many different types of antidepressants and have only seen positive results with this drug, though it varies with different people. I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety disorder. Started treatment at fourteen years old, went on Remeron at sixteen and am currently 17 and have begun tapering off medications. Not 100% better, but have reached position where I am able to move on."
395$Condition: Other$7/31/2008 3:43:30 PM$Reviewer: Liz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed Remeron about 7-8 years for insomnia.  I would either go right to sleep and then wake up and not be able to go back to sleep (toss and turn) or I would not be able to get to sleep until the wee hours of the morning, then it would be time to get up.  I started taking Remeron for insomnia about 8 years ago, I guess, and it has been a godsend.  I take it about a half hour before I hit the sack and sleep (deep restful) for 8 hours.  I am not drowsy when I wake up and do not have any dizzyness, lightheadedness or any side effects mentioned.  I am a much more productive and not-sleep deprived individual since being on this medication.  Not too much in the information about helping for insomnia, though.

It makes me restless when I first go to sleep but when I get to sleep I am out.  I think it is a really good drug.  I have been on it for about a week now.  I can already tell a difference in my appitite, which is good I guess cause my family gets onto me about how skinny I am all the time.  But overall I think it is currently doing its job.

If I woke up any earlier, I'd still be dizzy and disoriented.  Its effects on the depression symptoms were hardly noticeable, if at all.  Besides knocking me out cold for half the day, the only other thing it did was give me an insatiable sweet tooth (and a constant craving for oreos of all things).

408$Condition: Depression$4/5/2008 10:52:21 PM$Reviewer: Saved by Remeron, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$To all of you who are thinking of stopping the medication because of weight gain, feeling like a zombie, those terrible nightmares, lack of sex drive, etc... I too have had all of these side effects. Before starting treatment on Remeron coupled with Lexapro (after trying every other drug on the market and suffering for 5+ years) I truly was ready to die. I had no will to live, I was angry at everything! I truly/sadly was Suicidal and Homocidal.  I would fall asleep within 5-15 minutes of taking it (the reason you take it before bed) no matter what I was doing, EATING, talking, painting my nails. I would also get this feeling of bugs crawling up and down my legs, which was discerning and extremely uncomfortable. And, I too had that INSAITIABLE APPETITE, 30lbs in the first 5months of treatment. That passed. ALL the side effects passed. My appetite is healthier now, but I'm not eating 5 candybars at once now, followed by a couple more! No terrible nightmares, no creepy crawly feelings, no more zombie girl, and I haven't gained any additional weight since the initial 30lbs. I have returned to earth! I have earned my bachelors degree in nursing and have been practicing for 1+ year. I've become married, bought a house, and am excited to live again! The last 4 years have been the best I'd had in a long time. The benefits have far outweighed the temporary side effects. Isn't your happiness worth it?!

This medication worked very well for me. I have been taking it for-wow didn't realize-6 or 7 yrs. now. The truths are the weight gain. I gained weight and excercise didn't seem to help that much. However, after awhile on the medication, my body must have leveled out and i started to lose the weight with regular excercise. there is a drug they can give you to counter act the weight gain, but it also has it's side effects. I have also experienced hair loss. I did'nt relate it to the drug at the time, or maybe i did but it was working so i shrugged it off. My hair, 7 yrs. later, seems A LOT different. First there is a lot less of it, and second the texture seems to have also changed. I am now also experiencing muscle pain. Which, i also didn't relate to the medication until today. My dr. knew i was on it and I went to him for the pain, and he didn't even mention that it could be a side effect, he just wanted to put me on another med. and deemed it restless leg.. and I KNOW IT IS NOT THAT, but he couldn't figure out what it was. I just read on this website that muscle pain could be a side effect. Doesn't mean it will be and if the remeron is what is causing that, it took a very long time to happen. I am not on a high dose either, only 15mg. So, maybe it is time to get off and /or go to an even lower dose. It also took seven years to make really do a job on my hair. 
It did work for me, i didn't have any of the sexual, or numb side effects that other people complain about with other meds. I still think it works great. I  still feel without being depressed for abnormal lengths of time. I still get depressed / i mean sad or whatever, but it is manageable and it lasts about as long as sad feelings should (whatever that means). Anyway, i think dr.'s need to work on their diagnosing  skills. My dr. should have related the muscle pain to the drug. "

It will put you into a ""fog"" when waking up for the first 1-2 weeks, then that side effect wears off.  I have found it more effective than any other anti-depressent but only moderatly effective after all.  It will put you to sleep upon taking it, if you don't sleep you will feel like you took about 4 tylenol PMs.  I don't sleep very well and this drug seems to make me dream, but sometimes the dreams are full of anxiety.

Increased my appetite causing weightgain of 30 lbs.  From 124 to 155 lbs in 3 months.

441$Condition: Depression$11/27/2007 2:10:10 PM$Reviewer: angel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$5$when I first started taking remeron it worked great now that i have been on it for awhile it seems to have lost it effectivness. I does help me to sleep better which is why my doctor put me on it so i am happy with that. But my depression seems to still be hanging around so maybe my doseage needs to be changed although i am allready on 45mg per day.

My kids would cry, and I didn't care or comfort them.  I stopped taking the drug, and am feeling emotions again.  The med decrease the anxiety,  but the side effects outweighed the bennifits by a long shot.

444$Condition: Depression$11/14/2007 9:43:22 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$At first, the side effects were not so bad. I always felt like I had an insatiable appetite and snacks were good enough to minimize it. However, the drowsiness began to greatly affect me during the morning even when I took it early at night. I could not function properly because all I wanted to do was sleep. My thoughts were always clouded. It also made me feel numb. Overall, it did not help me unless feeling numb and stuffing myself is its purpose.

When it was combined with another drug I started gaining weight rapidly.  I don't know if it was weight alone or fluid retention but I became very uncomfortable when I tried to breath.  I felt has though something was pressing against my lungs or I had just competed in a marathon.  It works well, I think I had used up all my luck with this particular drug.

I take 1 30 MG tab at bedtime. My sleep has improved as well as my overall mood. I have not had any weight gain (could be because I am on Adderall as well). I have not had nightmares, or actually any dreams that I can remember.

My husband says I don't snore as much since I started this medication, and I noticed I don't sneeze as much as I used.  My sleep has been riddled with dreams.  I've always had vivid dreams, now the dreams are extraordinary.  Thankfully, no nightmares.  I would be interested to know if others have experienced a relief in respiratory symptoms, and with an increase in vivid dreams.

I've been taking this medication for 1-month and not one night has gone by that I have not had bad dreams.
During the daytime it is helping me tremendously.  

taking this medication has increased my appetite.

Overall, because of the nighmares and increased appetite I am discontinuing this medication."
