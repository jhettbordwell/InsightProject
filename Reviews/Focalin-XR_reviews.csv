The Bupropion was somewhat ineffective for ADHD, but helped with the anxiety and depression, so we added focalin/dexmethylphenidate. I am still taking 300mg Bupropion XL and added 10mg dexmethylphenidate er. I am very happy with the results. I feel more focused, have a much greater attention to detail, I am more aware of my surroundings (due to less daydreaming), just overall almost off my ADHD symptoms are significantly reduced. I experienced a very mild headache the first couple of days as well as extreme sleepiness in the afternoon, but a week later, those side effects have subsided. The first couple of days I also felt like I was at a loss of words, like I couldn't form coherent sentences and spoke sort of robotic, that also went away. My only issue is that it's going to be a pain to refill, since it's a controlled drug. It's also not in stock at most pharmacies, so I either have to ask around before my doctor fills it, or wait. Kind of a pain, but worth it in the end.

I am satisfied for the most part; however, he has complete lack of appetite for the 7 hours the drug actually works (compensating in the evenings by eating 3 plates at dinner). In addition, his hyperactivity after the drug wears off is significantly increased. We had to start him on Melatonin at night to settle his mind to get him to sleep. We are looking into a longer lasting medication.

I'm 16 now and I've been on it for 8 years, taking a three year break and now ready to be back on it. While on it I was a star child. Perfect grades, attendance, hardly sick, calm, and never any sleeping problems. I did have appetite loss and I stayed thin but nothing to bad. Since being off of it I have developed a depression and anxiety disorder, its impossible to stay focused (ADD) and I've gained an easy 80 pounds. Parents, your kids really do benefit. I'm here to say. I'll be a junior this fall and I'll graduate with honors and a 3.8 GPA. Hope this helps someone.(:

A few months ago I began to notice his extreme irritability. He has also developed anxiety and now horrible thoughts of hurting himself. An 8yr old should NOT be having harmful thoughts.

Debilitating ADHD. He has been getting kicked out of daycare slash school since age 2. I tried not to do meds but school insisted. We have tried Concerta, Vyvanse, Ritalin, and now Focalin XR.

This drug makes a big difference in how she acts and reacts. She says it makes it easier to pay attention and stay on task at school. We find that it lasts her about 6-8hrs and her side effects are minimal, usually lack of appetite midday, but she makes up for it with breakfast and dinner. She does have occaisional headaches but no trouble sleeping or any other side effects. She will usually remind us that she needs her meds.

At one point I was wondering if I was alone. My 9 year old son has ADHD and is on the spectrum. I started out with Vvaynse and it was terrible made him angry and then I switched to a non stimulant Intuniv which took over a month to work and I had to up the mg because of his body weight and it still didn't work how I wanted. He was still having behavior out burst at school ( this started this school year) I have now switched to Focalin 10 mg so far slight headaches in the morning and afternoon no appetite and not sleeping again as well as he did on Intuniv ( which made him couldn't get up to use the restroom in the middle of the night) but the moment it wears off he eats everything in sight. We are on break so I am hoping for the best when he goes back to school this week.

It works well for about 4 hours,by 5 pm, he is unable to focus again (we just try to get all his homework done before it wears off). Takes melatonin to sleep at night.  Stomach pains come and go (diarrhea, gas, etc...) we just treat them as they come. NO appetite while on it, but on weekends when we dont give it to him, he eats everything all day long! Just recently though, he's been very aggressive, beligerent and incooperable, angry outbursts, really emotional and can't stop making noises with his mouth. Possibly going to see a phsychoterapist.

It made a considerable difference in his school work and he gets in less trouble for talking when he shouldn't, getting up when he shouldn't etc. but it makes him somewhat dulled, crabby and distant especially when it starts to wear off. I don't usually give it to him on the weekends or in the summer and his sweet and bubbly personality comes back. I wish I didn't have to give it to him but he cannot control his impulses at school without it. I know alot of doctors say that there doesn't need to be a break but my advise is to only give it for school and let the body and mind be medication free whenever possible.

I have a week on Focalin XR, and I notice the difference I can concentrate, now in the evening I feel very energetic, but I use dissolving Clonazepam 0.5mg, and it puts me to sleep.

Her performance and behavior in school improved immediately and her grades have been all A's and B's.  She does have a little trouble falling asleep at night, so I give her a 3mg melatonin and that works very well.  Her behavior at home is normal and appropriate for her age.  We did try to go to the next dose up at one point, but then she had side effects and we had to go back to the 5 mg--and I won't change it.  I hated to have to put her on anything, but she had been getting notes sent home since preschool almost daily and I think it was really effecting her self esteem.  I always tell her the medicine can only do so much, you have to be aware of your actions and take control of yourself.  If you're on the fence about using an ADHD med--then do a trial of this one in the lowest dose.  My daughter only uses it during the school week and doesn't take it on weekends or vacations.  It is not the type of med that has to build up in your system to be effective and you can easily go off of it without problems.

My son has debilitating ADHD.  He has a spectrum disorder as well, and requires an aide in school.  I did not want to medicate him, but I felt I had no choice if I wanted him to live a normal life with friends, learning, fun, etc.  So we started 5mg once a day.  I give it to him at 9 am and it lasts till about 9 pm.  The hyper behavior is gone. Almost completely.  His beligerance is also pretty much gone.  He cries a lot easier, but we deal with that with our words.  He is one of those kids who talks about his feelings with no problems so we are trying to battle the weepiness with talking.... which we could never do before.  I don't think I've had a conversation lasting more than 8 seconds with my son since the day he was born and now we talk about everything.  We play games, do puzzles, all things he couldn't do before.  He does Soccer and listens to the coach and has fun instead of constant outbursts.  Side effects have included lack of appetite, my suggestion is give tasty high calorie snacks all day long, our favorite are veggie chips, health shakes and yogurts.  I also don't like that he focuses TOO MUCH on one activity, and will do it, quietly for hours if I don't intervene.  Strange, but he seems happier.  MUCH happier.

He is even aware of the positive changes the medicine is giving him and feels happy and confident about the improvements he is able to make due to the improvements in his focus.

I had been on Ritalin and Concerta as a young kid to early teen, and had to stop taking concerta because of irregular heartbeat that was developed.Fortunately it did go away. Focalin XR has been life changing. I am a young model and I travel and fly all the time, so it's great for helping me stay organized. As from any ADHD stimulant medication, I do experience a lot of anxiety,sometimes. For this reason, my doctor also has me on Ativan 1mg which is a benzodiazepine anxiolytic/sedative/musclerelaxer similar to low dose Valium and Xanax. This combination IS safe in low doses and keeps my heart from beating too fast from Focalin XR. I would highly recommend that anyone with anxiety problems from Focalin XR talk to their DR about adding a small dose of Klonopin or Ativan. Yes, these can be addictive medications, but if they are taken as they were meant to be and under parental/doctor supervision, there is really nothing to worry about, but if you absolutely cannot go with the benzos and want something entirely non-addictive for FocalinXR anxiety you could also ask for gabapentin (generic Neurontin). The great thing about all 3 of the anti-anxiety drugs I listed is that all are available in generic forms, hence, much cheaper. That matters when you're buying FocalinXR every month...lol. I Hope this helps!

Over the years, I adapted to the scatter-brained, distracted feeling of ADHD -- don't like it but I've used it productively, successfully (juggling lots of work and activity at once). The more destructive symptom of ADHD is the constant chasing a rush (of dopamine) and the anxiety and depression that follows when rush is over.
Taking the meds doesn't help me focus as much as give me a euphoric high, it is speed after all. 
I feel like I'm on a smaller dose of a street drug like speed or cocaine. Can't imagine giving it to kids. "

Before then I did poorly in school and had no ability  to focus. After I started taking Concerta my school performance increased. However, Concerta had very severe side effects. Quite often I would forget to eat some days because I did not feel hungry although I should have been. I switched to Focalin XR a few years ago (currently at a 40mg dose, combined with 5mg-10mg of short acting depending on the day) the school performance has still been great but now I do not experience the same level of side effects. I noticed that someone asked if when taking the medication you experience nausea. Yes, if you have nothing on your stomach you will experience severe nausea and stomach pain for about 1-2 minutes when the medication is kicking in. One other thing to note, my hands and feat sweat an abnormal amount when I am on the medication. But other than that, I am currently in all honors and AP classes and have a 4.5 gpa. I would not have this without the medication. The benefits outweigh the downsides in my mind. I would recommend it to anyone struggling with ADHD.

Scared of natural disasters and he made the comment that he did not feel safe with me. He felt as though I was going to leave him. He was very paranoid and scared to death of everything. I'm not giving him the meds on the weekend. I plan to try again on Monday and if he still has issues, I will contact the doctor to try a different medication. Anyone have any suggestions?

Since being diagnosed and starting 20mg XR a day I have figured out my own patterns of adjusting to the medicine.  To start, I was told that it lasts only 8 hours.  Honestly, I feel the effects for 12-15+.  I have to manage when I take it or else it affects my eating and sleeping pattens.  With it I have seen an improvement in my grades, so it does out way the side-effects.  I want to make clear that it has helped tremendously in my college career, my only advice is to make sure you or your child are on a strict regulated schedule, that way you will there will be a diminished chance for side effects.

He also has a great deal of anxiety along with ADHD.  We have seen very good results as far as behavior.  He is doing better in school.  He says he feels a lot less anxious when taking it and the ""channels aren't changing in his brain"". We notice his interactions with us and others is much better when taking medication.  His impulse control is greatly reduced!  Our only concern is that he does experience a ""come down"" usually around 8PM (he usually takes about 7AM).  If we are home he does fine, but if he is out he sometimes gets very anxious and nervous for about an hour until it completely wears off.  However, the positive results far out weigh this occasional problem.  It is VERY expensive and there doesn't seem to be much help for middle class families who do have insurance coverage but not much for medications.  We have decided it is worth the cost, but definitely a sacrifice in the wallet!  Wonder about children who have families that don't have the option do, very sad."

I have been on Focalin XR 10 mg for 30 days and have defintely seen an improvement in my focus.  When I first started the medication it was almost as if the brakes were being applied to the multitude of thoughts that would run through my mind so that I could more easily focus on the item that I wanted to address.
The same thing occured when listening to a conversation from someone that was speaking to me.
It does not eliminate all those extra thought distractions but it has defintely reduced them significantly so that I can focus better.
I like others wish that we would of had this type of medication and understanding of ADHD when we were growing up but at least it's comforting to know that our children and grandchildren will have a chance to address it in a more positive way in the future. "

My son is 8, but we have been struggling and going through testing with this as well as a speech delay since the age of 2, hoping he would out grow the issues we face and knowing he was too young to diagnose and being afraid to medicate so early. he received speech therapy from the age 2-almost 5, and started kindergarten with out speech therapy. His behavior started becoming an issue between the ages of 2-3 (which i felt could have been a result of not being understood with his speech delay). At the age of 5 we finalized with the doctors saying he was too young to diagnose, with thoughts of him out growing the issues, and contacting them later if needed. We have delt with a LOT of behavior issues in school, including suspension in 1st grade, several disiplinary notes, meetings held at school, etc. My son is now in 3rd grade and is expressing verbally how hard it is to control himself. We have decided to try medication after being able to think on it for 3 years and my son noticing things within himself. This is only day 2 of taking meds and the first one we have tried, i will update as we go along, i have pretty much made myself sick trying to be observant on how this is effecting my son, and trying to distingish regular from irregular side effects. i know i am not the only one, so i will update.

Boys will be boys, but he was WAY beyond a typical, energetic kid.  We stopped going to church because Sunday school teachers had him in time-out most of the class and couldn't handle him. I didn't go to the grocery alone with him, only if my husband could be there to help corral him. Our pediatricians nurse suggested that he needed more discipline.  I started crying! I said, ""He spends most of his time in time out, we've even tried spanking, rewarding doesn't work, I can't friggin' discipline him any more than I do!  FYI- his 8 year old brother has NEVER been in trouble at school, is always polite, I knew it wasn't our parenting.  Our son needed help.  He's not a bad kid, he's just impulsive and can't focus or control himself. We started on Concerta and got major symptom relief.  However, after 6 months my son had actually lost weight and he had major trouble falling asleep(like up until midnight). We switched to Focalin XR. He eats, gains weight, and sleeps!!! We are very pleased. He's on 10mg at 7:00am and has to take a 2.5mg(non-XR) around 2-3pm because it wears off.  I just called the Dr. to discuss trying 15 mg XR in the morn because he is struggling a bit in kindergarten with following the rules, focusing, etc.  He's still worlds better than before the medication!  Basically, we like Focalin more than Concerta because his true personality still shines through(not a zombie), he eats great, and he sleeps 
better.  Once we get the dosage fine tuned I know he'll be good to go. I wish he didn't need any medication, but I'm thankful we have found something to help our son.  He's not the ""bad kid"" anymore. People get to know the real him and that's a beautiful thing!"

The only side effect I notice, is that I have post-nasal drip, and this drug seems to make it much worse about 1 hour after taking it.  Usually it involves me throwing up until I can get rid of the phlegm, then I'm fine.  But Focalin works so well, I just deal with it.   I'm working with my allergist to see if there is anything else that can be done for the post-nasal drip.

I used to take Concerta 135mg until last summer where I switched to Focalin XR 30mg. The decrease in appetite ceased. Also, I could sleep when on the medication. This may be because I am used to it and the side effects that stimulants have but it is nice. Also to those who ask why there child cant sleep. It is because the medication lasts 12-15 hours and is a stimulant so it will keep them up. Don't use the XR if it is past 11am use the normal focalin or they wont sleep. I also twitch and have shaky hands but it is not that bad. My school performance has increased dramatically since I started taking medication for ADHD. I would recommend this medication.

It begun with 10mg, but teacher said child was a zombie.
It went down to 5 MG.
It changed my child completely. 
Wince a happy loving active child, it turned her into a robot like kid. Her expressions changed. Aches and pains all over her body happened daily.
Disabilitating headaches were a daily thing.
She was also beginning to have a numbness feeling in her hands and feet. Weird.
What it did good - her teacher was happy. She didn't have to help the kid to accomplish her tasks. 
My thought today - after giving Focalin for 1 1/2 year to my second grade child is that the pill definitely speed them up.
But that is how these pills are called, right? Speed.
I do not think it helped the child. Even though she finished her work independently, she would have finished the same work with a little more teacher attention without the pill.
There is a book - ADHD Fraud - that opened my eyes.
The only thing the pill accomplish is to let the teacher have a better life. It destroys the child brain - shrinks it over time - and also changes the child healthy heart into a diseased one, with physical changes.
What we got out of the experience - change the child school before you dope your child. Focalin is a dope and the results only benefit the teacher.
Give the teacher a speed pill and keep the children unharmed.
My child will not be in a pill anymore.
She does have a slow nature and giving her speed drugs won't change her nature.
The side effects are not worthy.
And your doctor will not tell you that.
As a matter of fact, my child doctor doped his own child everyday. I cannot understand that.
I think we will be changing pediatrician also.

SAY NO TO DRUGS - including FOCALIN.

It is bad for your child.
Change the school or even homeschool before you speed her up.

Just a thought."

I feel drained of life, my mouth gets dry, I lose my appetite, I have NO desire to be talked to, and overall just feel like dying. When I first take it, the next three or four hours are alright. I am more calm, and I stay on task better. But by the time I get to my afternoon classes (where I tend to not have as much work) I start to feel like a zombie. Such as right now. Weird thing is, when I do work I don't have such a strong feeling. Like right now for example, typing this is kind of like work so I'm not wanting to jump in front of traffic as much. I guess you have to fight it, I don't know. From around 4:00pm to 9:00pm I literally just want to die and regret ever taking the medication.

She was very smart and always knew the answers to everything the teacher asked, but was constantly in trouble in school because she could not sit still and could not follow directions. At home, we frequently had to deal with her temper tantrums and big meltdowns. We couldn't figure out what set her off. Her Kindergarten teacher suspected that she had ADHD and suggested that we seek a specialist for diagnoses. She was correct. The neurologist diagnosed my daughter with ADHD and prescribed her the 5 mg Focalin XR. She tried it for a week but it didn't have any noticeable effect on her. The doctor then increased the dosage to 10 mg. The effect was dramatic. It was like an on/off switch. When the medication went into effect, she was very reticent. I didn't like it because it's almost like she's completely a different person. However, she was able to sit still in class, follow directions, and concentrate on what she was doing. It boosted her self confidence because she stopped getting in trouble in school and as a result, she's more popular with the other kids. She is now 8 1/2 and is still on the same 10 mg dosage. Over time, the effect of the 10 mg medication did seem to lessen but I think she's now at a perfect balance. She is less reticent but is still able to focus in school. One major side effect of the medication is loss of appetite. She does not eat much, if any, at lunch time when the medication is in effect, so I always make sure that she eats a big, healthy breakfast before school. By dinner time, the medication has worn off, so she gets her healthy appetite back.

We both take 10mg daily for ADHD. I might need to increase my dosage since the effects are wearing off by noon if I take it at 7. 
BEST THING WE EVER DID! We can do things one at a time. We don't flit around doing a million things. We have learned how to plan short term and long term tasks/goals. Our personalities have not changed at all. We did not lose our appetites. I wish I had this when I was younger so that I could have sat still and paid attention to school and social activities with less self-interruption. We both noticed a difference the first day. No headaches or prolonged weird feelings. First and second day I experienced a total of 3 moments (2 seconds) of dizziness. It did not affect my job performance or ability to remain working with my students. I can honestly say that this medication has made a huge difference in our lives. 
Being able to sort out my thoughts and follow along in class, conversations, and my own stream of consciousness has truly improved my life. My son is less impulsive and is able to control his behaviors better."

This is the first med he has tried. His Dr insisted on putting him on 10 mg along with 5 mg of Abilify for his agressive behavior in school along with being defiant and socially detachment from others.  In the first three days we saw a drastic improvement, his teacher was not even aware that he was in the classroom.  She stated that he was so calm and focused, didn't blurt out in the class, did not get mad when he stated the wrong answer in class and begin beating himself in the head. At functions he began speaking to people instead of  rolling his eyes, balling up his fist telling them to get away or stay from him.  Sometimes he would just be sitting and get mad for no reason. He takes the focalin 10 mg around 6:15 am he catches the school bus around 6:25 (he eats breakfast before he takes his meds) the meds usually wear off around 4pm.  He takes the Abilify 5 mg approx. 6:00pm to control his aggressive behavior as of now they are working perfect together for him.  Yes he does experience dry mouth, a few headaches in which we give him a dose of childrens tylenol. when the focalin wears off he gets extremely hungry he has gained 3 lbs in 5 months.  He himself can tell the difference and feels better about taking the meds.  In his words ""Mom, I'm not tangle up and confused in the head anymore"". He had an appointment last week and the Dr. increased him to 15 mg because he is playing football and with the medication wearing off at 4pm and he is not from practice or a game until around 8:30 we will see if this hurts or help.  I will keep you posted. Our next appointment is in two weeks. Meanwhile continue to pray while using and searching for the right meds.  "

However, there are some side effects that are most likely due to the fact that I am on 3 of the 20mg pills. I usually experience a loss of appetite at lunch and I occasionly feel lightheaded and dizzy. I was also prescribed Clonidine with the focalin. The Clonidine is some kind of blood pressure medication that helps relax me at the end of the day so I can sleep. Overall I feel the drug has helped me.

He is doing well now but can have playground issues when irritated by other kids. He is not a big eater for lunch when on it but eats well at night. No weight lost but sems very forgetful and lots of daytime wetting and some nighttime bedwetting. Seems to heave put on lots of weight this last 8 months. I can tell that it has worn off after school but don't mind i can handle that. I just want him to be able to function and concentrate in school.  He likes that he is not distruptive anymore and loves to be able to understand what is being taught. Sleeps well but only concerned about daytime wetting. I like the fact that he can go without it on weekends and in the summer if needed without side effects and I feel better knowing he can give his body a break.

We started out with the 15 mg dose, but increased it after it was wearing off before school ended.  At the 20 mg dose we were getting about 9 hrs coverage which was great and he was doing excellent in school academically, however he started to shut down socially.  My son does have an autistic spectrum disorder as well and the focalin just intensified his anxiety and withdrawn behaviors.  I was very pleased with how he was preforming academically, but felt he had become a zombie and was really my son.  Parents need to beware of this type of behavior.  We decreased back to 15 mg to see if the behaviors subsided some and there was marked improvement in his social behaviors.  We have since decided that the risk of blunted or withdrawn behaviors developing was not worth the excellent coverage we were getting and have discontinued the use of this medication.  We are currently working to find another medication that will provide the length of coverage as well as the results for focuse and attention without losing the little boy in the process.

My son was going to be held back in the 1st grade if he did not show any improvement fast. And this medicine is working very well he can pay attention and actually can sit still to do his work, his teacher is AMAZED! and is very proud to see him doing so good. However, coming off the medication is terrible! he gets angry, mean, and uncontrollable sometimes, I think that after the school year is over I will change the medicine to something else.

Before concerta i took ritalin but I can't take meds twice a day at my highschool. The medication does what it says i can sit still and get things done but i lack all personality and it really hinders my social life and it seems to amplify my sleeping problems. I now use Melatonin to help me fall asleep but i think i needed this before the focalin anyways. I have moved to only taking it if i know i will really need it a specific day but i try to stay off of it and control it myself which i have not been able to do until recently. I highly suggest you try to control yourself once you get to be 15-16 but until then this is a great resource. Oh it also causes some unbearable dry mouth

I think Concerta helped more with the ADHD symptoms, but considering the side effects, overall I am more satisfied with the Focalin.  My son states he likes the Focalin 20 mg the best out of all the other drugs he has tried-Straterra, Concerta 54 mg and Vyvance 10 mg.  There was often a noticeable irritable time in the evenings when the medicine was wearing off.

He was hitting, pinching, spitting, not minding, disrupting class, etc.  After several sessions with a counselor, we decided that medication was necessary.  He started on Focalin XR in December and has shown great improvement. He is on 5mg, once a day.  As for side effects, he lost one pound the first month, but gained two the second.  He has no trouble going to sleep, or any other side effects.  However, we are now into month 3 and I truly believe we need to up the dosage.  The last couple of days he has had had outbreaks of bad behavior, not at school, but at home.  He is rebellious, sassy, and sometimes mean.  The Focalin is supposed to be an 8-10 hour relief, but when it wears off, we all know it.  Sometimes, it happens after he has had the meds, but these ""fits"" usually only last about 10 minutes and then he is fine.  Has anyone else had this problem?"

He is performing much better at school, making all A's.  However, there are a few side affects that we have noticed that aren't listed on the drug info sheet.  Such as, moodiness and constipation.  He eats and sleeps well, has not lost any weight so far.  However, he does have to take Miralax daily for constipation.  Hoping the moodiness wears off when he becomes adjusted to the medication.  He is currently taking 10 mg each morning.

He is doing great on it.  We decided to switch him from Strattera because of his not eating.  He is a very small 8 yr old, about 45 pounds.  Since switching to Focalin XR, I can't seem to keep enough food in the house.  Very excited about this drug not giving him the side effects that all the others had.  This med also does not seem to cause the sleepiness that the others do.  He has put on about 5 pounds since starting this med.  Hopefully it will continue to work.  Also not having the problems with aggression like the other meds seem to give him.

Started with 5mg now on 10mg.  Is doing much better, not acting up in class as much, when she gets upset , she is much easier to calm down. Is much more focused on things she is doing, She  can not swollow the pills, so we open them and sprinkle over a spoon full of chocolate pudding. At first we even had a problem getting her to take that, but I made a game out of it, I bet her she couldn't take it before I counted to 10, it was gone before i even got to 2, quick drink of water after and  we are good to go. It was causing some appitate loss, so we give it to her after she eats breakfest, works great.  Good Luck

He has ADHD that seriously hampered his learning.  Before we decided to put him on this medication he was failing 1st grade and had to be put on an IEP (Individialived Evaluation Plan) where they found he had a learning disablity due to behavior and attention problems.  Now he is performing at above grade average and is no longer considered to have a learning disability.  I do not want to be a cheerleading mother for this drug, I myself wonder everyday if I am doing the right thing for my son long term.  But the short term does not lie and he could definitely not have the success he is having without the medication.  He tells me this as well.  He knows when the medicine wears off, which is about 4:30pm.  So far he is confident in his ability to control himself at school to learn, and is working on peer relations.  My son could not tolerate concerta or adderall.  They made him mean and aggressive.  So I guess as far as it goes, which is for the last 2 years, this medication works very well in treating my sons ADHD.
