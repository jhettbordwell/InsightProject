So I've been on Cloneazepam for almost a year now to treat my sleep paralysis, insomnia and anxiety. It's been a good ride and has make me alcohol free for almost a year which is a bonus. I take .5mg in the morning, .5 in the afternoon. Evenings I take 1mg and sometimes smoke a little herb to help me fall asleep faster. I have started to notice some withdrawls after 8-9 months of use and now that I'm almost a year in, I'm finally slowing down the use and hopefully in 2 months I'll be benzo free. Anyways clonazepam is great, it last 12 hours in your system instead of 6 hours like alprazolam (xanax) and the clonazepam is the best benzo/tranquilizer out of all the benzos. Anyways if you have bad seizures, really bad sleep paralysis like I have or have crippling anxiety i recommend you talk to your doctor about this medication.

It can be a very addictive drug but if you use it the right way and you do not stay on it for a very long time and you will not become physically and mentally addicted.I have been on all different types of anxiety and panic disorder medication and in most of them are addictive, I’ve been taking them since I am 12 I am 27 and I have had not one problem and I have been on and off them through the years.

This is the worst drug to come off of and doctors will not agree on the effects that your body is putting you in withdrawal. This leaves the patient to advocate for himself.  This is a BAD DRUG. It should be taken off the market.

18$Condition: A Feeling of Restlessness with Inability to Sit Still$9/16/2018 11:24:20 PM$Reviewer: Jer98999, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$I have a severe case of constant anxiety where I would describe it as like water forcing against a dam wall and not releasing and the pressure just stays and builds up forever without breaking. Ok so when I take my Klonopin it allows this water to break out of the dam wall and release about half of it. Klonopin is a great med to take but it's better to possibly not take it daily as you will build a tolerance  to it and even have bad, odd side effects. As you take it daily the med will continue to build up in your system, build and build until the concentrations are way too high. So I've discovered it's better to take 2 or 3 days off from time to time in order to get the drug out of your system a bit and then let your system reboot, and then when you take your next done it will feel much better and help your restless anxiety much better than consistently taking every day. Nice to get that reboot from time to time, trust me. When using it responsibly at your lowest effective dose, whatever that may be, depending on you, it should really help zap your restless, anxious racing mind and intense anxiety! Like I stated above,  it'll let that dam break its wall a little bit and release and relieve the pressure in the mind and even body and the worst of the dreadful anxiety. Be aware this is a very addictive drug, therefore you must really have a need for it like intense, uncontrollable anxiety, racing, agitated mind etc. If so, it'll help you but make sure to let your system clean out and reboot from time to time for a couple of days and it'll work the best like that. For me this is the best way, for you it may or may not but if you're dealing with a long period of intense, non stop anxiounsness and restlessness caused by mental issues etc, I'd give this a good try! I personally like the generic Mylan brand, other's have better luck with a different clonazepam such as Teva etc. My 2 cents. Talk to your doctor 1st of course as I certainly am no medical professional.

My dreams were very troubling and I awoke stressed and fearful. I was hospitalized for 2 weeks in a mental health facility and the attending Psychiatrist substituted Xanax for Clonazepam. I take (2) 0.5 mg tablets at bedtime and (1) 0.5 tablet in the morning. It has totally eliminated my panic attacks and I feel much better generally. In addition I was put on Omega 3 Fish Oil softgels    that I take (2) daily in the morning and at bedtime. In my case, this medication has changed by life for the better and I feel normal once again.

Seemed to work great at first.  After a month on this medication, my anxiety went through the roof and I became suicidal and aggressive to others.  Started tapering off, and ended up with panic attacks, severe body pains, burning skin, and movements much worse than the restless leg I was prescribed this for.  These side effects lasted for months, and if we had not been on light duty at work allowing me to take extra time off, I would have lost my job.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone!

I resisted this med., tried ibuprofen & acetaminophen, but this tiny dosage of clonaz. definitely works the best & it is now all I take for the problem.

It worked great at first. Now my brain has become used to it, it no longer works. At the beginning, if I missed a dose, I would be in a zombie-like state, feeling like literally I was dying. Now, if I miss a dose, nothing happens. Also, the pills start to dissolve in your mouth almost instantly, and can get stuck in your throat or the roof of your mouth quite easily when trying to swallow them. I also have severe memory loss for a long time, am unsure if this drug is the reason.

It will make you feel very groggy in the mornings as it has a fairly long half life. When I was taking 3 mg a day I found it had an affect on achieving orgasm during sex. Overall it is a proven medication and I would recommend it especially for those who have anxiety issues or restlessness. I have never found it difficult to stop taking but you have to wean yourself off it very carefully. Do not try to get off any amount of it cold turkey.

I take 80mg Prozac (the therapeutic dose for anxiety) and 10mg Buspar (for anxiety).  For breakthrough attacks in the past I have been on Xanax and prefer that.  Now my Dr. has me on Clonazepam and I do not like it.  While it does work- it takes an hour to work (too long if I think I am dying) and it makes me sleep.  That might sound good- but I can't work or function if I take it.  So- I try not to take it.  If it was immediate release and only worked for 4 hours I would love it though.

When introduced to clonazepam, I was not informed of just how addictive this drug is. clonazepam helped me for years but after a while made me very suicidal. My doctor and I are now working closely together to taper me off of clonazepam. I have replaced the clonazepam with Librium which is a long lasting benzodiazepine for the slow taper from clonazepam. The taper will take 3 months and then I will have to taper off of the Librium which is much less addictive than the clonazepam. My reason for this comment is in no way to inform anyone about their form of treatment for their condition. Rather, it is to warn anyone of just how addictive clonazepam is and how difficult it is to get off of. Good luck to all and may God bless you!

I have been on clonazepam for 20 years. The drug helped me for years but ended up making me very suicidal. My physician and I are working closely together now on a very slow taper to get off of clonazepam. The taper requires a replacement drug to get off of it. I am in my third week of the taper replacing the clonazepam with Librium which is another benzodiazepine which is much easier to get off from than clonazepam. This taper will take 3 months. Then I have to be slowly tapered off of the Librium. When I was introduced to clonazepam, I was never told just how addictive it is. While I would never try to interfere with anyone's treatment, I would DEFINATELY caution anyone given clonazepam to be extremely careful because it is extremely addictive and extremely difficult to get off of. My whole reason for making this comment is to let the reader know just what they are getting into by taking this drug. It does work but is extremely addictive. Good luck and may God bless you all!

It still helps my RLS about 90% of the time. I'm on 3 a day of the 1 mg and I really think I need mine increased but I don't know if my dr will increase the dosage to the 2 mg. I think the 2 mg in the morning and 2 mg at night would do the trick. That's one pill less a day but it's also 1 mg more a day if it's changed to the 2 mg. I've had RLS since Id was 17 and I've been on carbidopa levodopa for it at first and after about three weeks on that my legs got so bad at night. That medicine made it worse so that's when I changed dr's and was put on the 1 mg 3 times a day. It also works great for my panic or anxiety attacks. I think I having a heart attack when I have those episodes. But if I take a clonazepam it will knock out my chest pains and jaw pain and arm pain in about 20 minutes. It's scary because I'm at the age that I could be having a heart attack and think it's just anxiety.

47$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/18/2016 2:56:30 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$In 2010 I was prescribed Clonazepam at 1 mg three times a day for severe anxiety/panic attacks. My wife was terminal with cancer since 2005 and was given 3 to 6 months to live after the initial surgery. She had 3 more surgeries and 5 rounds of chemo treatments and after each event I was told 3 to six months. She lived until 2011. I was already being treated for clinical depression (since 1995) and was in terrible shape. My doctor prescribed the Clonazepam and referred me to other options to deal with the anxiety. It really helped when the 'other' non-medical options failed to keep my mind in check. This med actually kept me from killing myself. Unfortunately my condition did not improve with the death of my wife and under close supervision of my doctor I remained on the Clonazepam until January of 2016 when the VA, whom I have been under their care since 2013 when I moved back to my home town, mandated that anyone using Clonazepam and any opiate had to choose to either stay with the Clonazepam or the opiate (I have been on morphine for degenerative discs). You could not use both because of the possibility of developing breathing problems. I had been taking both since 2010 and have not had any problems. The VA prescribed Hydroxyzine Pamoate at 25 mg twice a day. It has not helped my panic issues at all. It just makes me very sleepy and is giving me sinus headaches behind my eyes. I've been on this shit for two weeks and cannot function at all. I'm to damn drowsy and so damn agitated that I haven't left my apartment in a week. I looked up that med on WebMD and found out that the main function of it was for sinus issues, not panic attacks. Note: I can't take antihistamines because of 'another' medical problem I have. I am at my wits end and need to get this resolved before I end up taking that dirt nap.

I am prescribed three mgs. a day. If I don't take them I will have extreme anxiety and even panic attacks. I found to take as prescribed instead of as needed, it is better to prevent a panic attack rather than have to wait for the medication to work in the middle of an attack! The only reason I gave three stars on effectiveness is due to most of the new generics, they don't seem to be as effective as the older ones such as the Tevas. In my opinion brand name works the best followed by the Tevas then the ""m"" followed by the worst which are the blue ""v"". I'm prescribed the one mg. tablets."

I started with one mg. pills, one in the morning, one at night, along with an anti-depressant at night.  It did help me calm down, but did little to help me sleep.  My Dr. then upped it to 3 times daily, then 4 times daily.  That's where I am now.  One time while on this med, I found myself between Drs. and had no refill.  I went 2 weeks without it, I had major hallucinations, sweating, headache, body aches, etc. and ended up in the hospital for 3 days.  I was off them for awhile.  But, my panic attacks came back with a vengence, so I was back on them again.  I imagine that I will be taking them the rest of my life.

It is an extremely effective medication for panic disorder, general anxiety, and OCD for me.  I am 52 years old and after making planes turn around in the sky and 4 hours in security (pre 9-11) as I was certain my plane would crash, I was prescribed it starting at one mg a day.  After having a panic attack in traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge and getting out of my car to practice my breathing techniques at the rail of the Bridge, with people screaming ""don't jump,"" it was increased to the level I now take. (Fortunately it was late 1990's and a adorable Dr. In a Porche recognize what was happening and calmed the situation). So no arrest...  Lastly, I want everyone to know, one must tritrat off only with your physicians care and very slowly.  The withdraw symptoms are horrific when I tried once.  Eyes bouncing around shakes sweats etc.  this is drug dependence not addiction.  I also do not believe it to be an acute medication but not sure.  Xanax etc. Give me a hang over feeling the next day or. Headaches mid day.  Drinking and taking this mediation will make a person forget - memory loss.  Just make sure you follow Dr. 's advice to the letter.  Oh yes, and during the withdrawal if too fast, one can actually have seizures- even if you were not prescribed it for any seizure disorder like Epilepsy.  Thank you for reading this."

With the help of Clonazepam, I was able to attain a therapeutic level of Zoloft and maintain it.

While you are on it, it works great at first. What they don't tell you is that this drug causes major withdrawal for a large number of patients when you decide to go off of it. You have to taper off it like you are on heroine. It took me about 2 years of excruciating withdrawal effects to get off the dosage I was on. It even says on the box that the drug is not recommended for long term use, however doctors tend to ignore this. There are other treatments for most of the conditions that this treats so my advice is to try anything before this.

109$Condition: Other$5/8/2014 12:17:14 AM$Reviewer: Wade, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$"Initially this drug seemed safe and useful. I started this drug for anxiety and stress. Unfortunately, I had been extremely misled of its danger. The prescribing doctor eliminated it too quickly and then cowardly denied its correlation to seizures of my jaw radically chomping during the night, severe insomnia, panic attacks, thought process disturbances, and much more miserable consequences. When searching for what was wrong with me so desperately, I went to over twenty doctors that denied such possibility could happen until one that diagnosed me with Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS). Now, not one doctor can or has denied its correlation to my very ailing condition. I've never felt as though I was going to die so many times in my life, and I almost have many times. Had I known about its brain damaging factors, I would never had touched it. Stay away from this drug. Too many doctors are not managing it well and setting people up for misery on top of misery down the road. This will be the cause of your panics, and much worse. My condition is possibly lifelong. It also made it to where I cannot feel pleasure whatsoever and more severe consequences. Thanks docs. 

Do your own research and do not trust the loosely prescribing doctors that try to convince you that it is safe for long-term use when it is not. 

One well written NYU report link is http://epilepsy.med.nyu.edu/treatment/medications /clonazepam

The Ashton Manual is also a great reference book that most of the world uses except the US.

Do your research before you use this drug! I was stuck on this drug for years. Don't let it happen to you!

Avoid this drug if you can!"

After an exhaustive and frustrating search for answers to, ""what exactly do I have and why am I not getting any better?"" After being misdiagnosed and having so called ""Pain Management Specialists"" send me to Psychiatrist's who misdiagnosed me and started and kept me on medications that have terrible side affects such as constant dry mouth, skin rashes, swelling of the tongue (so bad I could not speak)and the list goes on. This PAIN was NOT IN MY HEAD as I was told point blank. RSD/CRPS causes your sympathetic nerves & central nervous system to report REAL NERVE DAMAGE & it reacts to this by causing a ""Hyper-Nerve Stimulation"" which the BRAIN CANNOT HANDLE! Victims of this incurable disease/disorder or syndrome know how this manifests itself physically and this ""Hyper-Nerve Stimulation"" also causes our BRAIN to over-react to common stress ""Hyper-Sensitively""! Forget it if you experience major stress like the loss of a child or parent spouse. That's  when we experience ""flare-ups""! If you are unlucky enough to have foreign surgical objects such as metal screws,plates, etc. inside of you then watch out when the barometer drops and the weather changes because the PAIN,BURNING,NUMBNESS,JOINT & EXTREMITY SWELLING,HEADACHES,MIGRAINES,INABILITY TO THINK AND REMEMBER,TREMOR, MUSCLE SPASMS, SWEATING and INFLAMMATION,(PROBLEMS URINATING in my case) are part of the ""Internal Storm"" reacting to the ""External Storm or weather front getting ready to come through.

I am able to leave the house, drive to work, and basically function as an adult.

I have an Rx to take a 1mg tablet twice a day, but usually half a tablet in the morning will work, unless I anticipate having a horribly stressful day. 

In order to not develop a tolerance or dependence on this medicine, I take ""days off"" from it, maybe two days a week, when I know I have little to do or few obligations that I know I can get through on my own.

Both my parents suffered from mood swings which i did not understand at the time. Eventually at about the age of 20, my mood swings started to developed, but ony lasted for a couple of days. I visited my doctors about my systoms, but was never taken seriously. Most shrugged their shoulders and moved on. After my divorce and consequent remarriage, my wife began to become concerrd about my mood swings and suggested that I see a therapist. I did this but it did not help. 
Now at age 45, symptoms became more frequent and I recognize that I was becoming more like my father concerning his rapid mood swings.
Fortunately, I met a doctor who took interest in my concerns and actually spent over an hour with me listening itently to what I had to. After running serveral test an reviewing my medical records, he suggested that I try the drug clonazepam @ 2mg 1x.  I don't know if this was co-incindental, but the first night a took clonazaepam, i had the best night sleep that i have had in 35 years. No leg pains, no rumination and felt like a rejuvenating person again. I have been on this medication for about 4 years at the same dosage, but the effectiveness seem to be lessening. Obviously, different medications affect people differntly, but if my experience can help anyone, please consult your doctor about this drug. "

About six months ago.  I had a bowel operation in 1961.  Ruptured ovary was bleeding on my colon causing me great pain.

Surgeon said ""It was close to ..can't think of the word, but usually you die if that condition arises.  They removed to areas where the blood was dripping and found I had meckles diviticula which they removed, also appendix as a matter of custom then.  I had bad results, peptic ulcers and duodenal ulcer, acute diahhrea, pain and later kidney stones 5 years apart and one on each side, great anxiety, no drugs had been invented that were not addictive so I was one week on, then off for a week.  The off week was hell.  Also, I took paregoric when needed to stop diahrrea.  Later valium was invented and I took it at each meal and one at bedtime.  Now all those medications have been taken away and I am miserable.  Paregoric is no longer allowed thanks to the teen agers misusing it.  In fact, valium, the kidney stone pain medication and anything that kills the pain and helps the condition has been taken away caused by teen and young adults misuing it and I despise them for that. Now that the clonazepam has been weakened, the spactic colon is coming back.  They also tried a drug called Serax at first but the Valium was much better for calming my colon.
Surgeon told me I would have the diahrrea al the rest of my life.  It has been 52 years that I have been medicated for this condition."

I was quite impressed with how much this helped to relax my muscles, however I found that I need to take this at night no later than 7 to 8 hours before I need to be up the following morning. It is really helping better than the muscle relaxer. I am a person who has been on pain meds for over 15 years due to a car accidenct where I was rear ended and have so many things wrong with my back that it is hard to find ways of dealing with the multiple types of pain due to multiple diagnoses. I advise everyone I speak with to not give up and keep fighting for your rights especially when you are dealing with doctors who seem to think they have the manual to your body and know your body better than you do. Keep fighting for what is right for you no matter what anyone else might think. I have been fighting for my own rights for many years and have finally found a team of doctors who seem to listen to what I have to say and seem to understand my frustration of many years of dealing with doctors who don't seem to want to understand and/or deal with my issues. I have even had to deal with doctors and SSI tell me that I am too young to be having all of these issues. Whose right is it to say that anyone is too young to have any type of medical issue regardless of the issue or what caused it or your age. KEEP FIGHTING FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU PERSONALLY!!!!!!

And do not stay on this stuff for more than 2 months or less.  You will be fighting off really bad withdrawal symptoms rather than getting relief.

Whereas it once had a calming effect it now has a ""stimulant"" reaction.  Dr. wants me to stop it now.  Tapering off has been a nightmare. The whole withdrawal things are felt in 12 to 24 hours for me and just get worse. I wish I never heard of this stuff.
Reports on getting off this stuff gradually report that it can take up to a year, with some withdrawal effects remaining with you the whole time. It is clear I have a high tolerance now to Clonazapam and all I am taking it for is to stop the withdrawal symptoms.  So ... 5 years later, my Doc. decides he wants me off it. Five years!
I think I will not make it. Depression/Anxiety has been to long and I hurt physically and mentally. I will try to see if I can take this horrible stuff for the rest of my life.
I may have to cause going off it, I've been told it can cause life threatening events such as seizures that don't stop without major medical intervention ... like getting all kinds of drugs IV to stop the seizures before you die or worse, suffer brain damage.
If you are on this drug, get off it within a month or two ... or you will become addicted. Then you are lost, as I suspect I will be if I can't take small doses for life. "

Although it worked well at first, I needed higher and higher doses over time to achieve the same level of efficacy. This worried me and I decided to stop taking it. Even with a doctor's supervision and a very gradual dose reduction, I still experienced horrible withdrawal symptoms. I would strongly advise against EVER taking this drug, even for a short time. The road to dependence (both physical and mental) is a quick and slippery slope. An outstanding web site to look at is www.benzo.org.uk. You will find out about clonazepam's adverse effects, what withdrawal symptoms can occur, and learn about a time-tested method to get off of it. It's best however, to never take it in the first place.

Better for treating insomnia than for in-day anxiety relief.  I prefer Valium during the day; it provides just as good anxiety relief but makes me less drowsy.  10mg Valium is equal to approx 1mg of clonazepam.  I find Valium and Klonipin to not be addictive but found Xanax to be very addictive.  All of thes bentos will build up in your system and can turn you into a zombie quickly, so stick to the prescribed dosage.  I think that is 4mg/day for Klonipin and 40mg/day for Valium.  Summary: if you find it doesn't relieve your anxiety, or is too sedating, ask your doc if you can try Valium.  There's a reason Klonipin is not indicated for anxiety!

During that 6 months, I told my Doc 3 different times that I was feeling more anxious and each time he upped my dosage.  So, I finally gave up and stopped taking it. On April 19, '02 I had a seizure due to the quick withdrawal of chlonazepam.  That was my fault.  I'm thankful I wasn't driving at the time!  

Then, September of last year another one of my docs gave me chlonazepam again and within TWO weeks I had to be hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and I made slices down the whole length of my left arm with an open safety pin because I wanted to die but didn't want to kill myself.  I had also been on Ablilify for a year which made me feel restless, nervous, and anxious.  

In the hospital my new doc took me off chlonazepam and Abilify and put me on seroquel and prozac.  I was hospitalized for 3 nights. BOTH times I took chlonazepam I felt extremely suicidal!! I've been on my new meds for a year and feel better than I've felt in my whole life!  My body does NOT react well to chlonazepam!!  I will NEVER take it again! 

I AM pleasantly surprised that so many people gave GOOD reviews for it.  Glad it can help people even though it made my life a living nightmare."

I was prescribed this medication by a sleep disorder clinic after a 24 hour sleep test.  I had not slept much in several years and naturally was depressed from sleep deprivation. The doc put me on clonazepam, which is a depressant - right - I'm aready depressed and he gives me a depressant.  I started crying at the drop of a hat every day; that is until I figured out when this crying started.  It started with this medication.  I was only on it 3 weeks and called he to say that I'm going off this shxt! Talk to your doc

I started on this med 10 yrs ago after MANY others failed. It works Effectively for me as long as I take it each morning. I was on 6-8mgs per day YES a lot. Now I only take 2-4mg at most. The only issue I had with this was weaning down to a lower dosage, I had SEVERE mood swings, depression, paranoia and of course Panic Attacks. After consulting with my Psych. aka Dr. she made the process much better. SLOWLY weaning me down without any withdrawal but some anxiety. 
 The only thing that it doesn't help me with is restlessness so I continue to have trouble falling asleep for 2hrs usually 4-5x's a week. Not everyone has the same reaction to medications. This one is though by far the most Effective for Panic Disorder after I've been on more than I can count in the Benzo Family and many others. However, it is the most difficult to discontinue and the withdrawal can be extremely intense. Please anyone using this seek a professionals help and guidance to safely come of this Drug. Though I HIGHLY recommend for PD! FYI I am a 37yr old Female with a Family History of PD and Bipolar/Depression."

I've tried, hypnosis, books, head doctors, herbs, etc, don't waste your time or money on these things for many years, like I did. This is a REAL ILLNESS contrary to what people tell you. The doctors will give you some paxel or celexa and send you home to get rid of you. Unless you have this illness, nobody undestands.
I'm not a pill popper and don't even take asperin unless absolutly necessary. After over forty years I had my doctor prescribe me Clonazepam and it has changed my world. I feel like I did back when I was fifteen before I was druged back in 1969.
I use this stuff in moderation, and if by some chance I get addicted to it, so be it.
This has completely changed my life. I feel like a normal person again. I will literally kiss  Gods feet for finally waking up to this medication.
If you have any of these phobia issue, I bet it will work for you too.
Good Luck,"

Additional Meds & dosages:
Alprazolam 1 or 2 mg sub: q1-2 prn (as needed max 6mg/day)
Wellbutrin 150xl q3 am (all 3 in the morning)

Zanaflex 4mg q1 prn (for spasms)
Cerefolin NAC (L-Methylfolate) 7.5mg/day This new generation of vitamin requires a script although not a drug. It's a manipulated form of folic acid 8 times what you get from the GNC version but ALL of it crosses the blood brain barrier whereas OTC versions don't cross at all! That's why ur pee stinks (sorry). It's expensive & insurance won't pay but anyone on SSRI/SNRI's should be on this. It triggers the brains ability to start producing Dopamine, Seratonin and Norepinephrine! If there's nothing to ""reuptake"" then there's no point in using a re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI like Zoloft/Paxil etc...) Everyone should take this nutritional supplement if they take anti-depressants like Effexor, Paxil, Zoloft, Remeron, Cymbalta, Prozac, etc... The company making this curiously makes an almost identical substitute called ""Deplin"" which one thinks competes with the other, but they're both made by Pamlabs. Go to pamlab.com & can get your discount card cuz it's very pricey. It's a miracle vitamin for me. I had a brain injury because of a fall and lost short term memory retention. Dr's said it would take years for it to return. I started taking Cerefolin NAC w/ my Zoloft/Wellbutrin cocktail and it worked immediately. Both Deplin and Cerefolin work the same cuz the main ingredient is L-Methylfolate. Deplin is marketed as something that helps your anti-depressants while Cerefolin is marketed as early stage memory loss or Alzheimer's but it also contains B-12 and another Vitamin which actually makes the Cerefolin NAC a much more effective choice than Deplin for those taking anti-depressants while in either case, I don't see any value in Deplin cuz u'll need Vitamin B supplements as well.

For one month I up'd my dose and brought myself back down to my normal dose of 150.  Then I had something bad happen to me and I went into manic mode (up 24 hours just doing a lot of thing, always remaining busy to not think about the accident).  I got on 1mg of clonazepam because I didn't want to up my anxiety meds.  I only take one @ night if I need it.  It helps me out, calms my brain from thinking and I get a goods night rest and I'm not all manic doing 1,000 things @ once.  I couldn't imagine taking 3 of these a day, nor would I ever want to.  I think I'd be in zombie land, and I need to be productive during the day.  Eases body aches as well.  I do have trouble waking up on these and a little groggy feeling.  I would recommend for any anxiety or PTSD related treatments.

With originally Effexor and then I was weened off of that. For about 1.5 years (starting 2 years ago) I only used 0.5MG's maybe a half dozen times total. At that point they were no good and it was me dealing with my panic and anxiety attacks. Obout 6 months ago I went back on them because of losing myjob and issues with getting unemployment payments. Was put on Cymbalta for nervous ticks and this has been only used maybe another half dozen times. when i need it it works great. I never got addicted or needed to watch out that I was going to be dependent on it. I can see a life with very few panic attacks on the horizon soon. I can also say that Xanax only worked for a while for me and then didn't. 
It is also extremely important for people to make sure that they dont up the doses without help from a doctor first. Also if someone is a drinker this med or any anti anxiety med will have less if any effects. 
I feel that this med has helped me so much with another med to control the main anxiety issue plus a little Cognitive behavioral therapy has helped me. I have also by attacking my attacks not relying on this med to cure me. Its all up to me.

But this med is great.

It also helps me with FM pain with all the spasms as well as the complication of mitral valve prolapse and the anxiety it causes. I am very grateful for this med. I also take amitryptiline and cymbalta.  My doc told me she wants to discuss my use of clonazapam when I see her this month and only gave me one refill. That itself causes me stress and anxiety. I fear that she may want to take me off this med which has done so much to help me.

I was experiencing random muscle spasms in my back, right leg and right arm so severe that I was medically retired (total disability) under Social Security. I am now 63 and have been retired about five years.  My last Orthopedic doctor agreed to try and lessen the spasms with an anti anxiety drug, I had learned from a Pharmacist acquaintance that it might be of use.  The relief was verging on spectacular  and a year later when I had moved to another State and entered a Pain Relief Clinic the medication was changed to Clonazepam 2mg twice daily, as needed.  My condition improved so much that 2 mg at bedtime has all but stopped the spasms,  On occasion I may have to use more but I have had no side effects and my quality of life is up 50%.

I had been begging my psychiatrist to prescribe a benzodiazepine throughout my treatment. Finally, he did. I have been taking Clonazepam for some three months now, and I can only say that this drug has saved my life. My debilitating anxiety is gone; I no longer have panic attacks; I have returned to college, and I am generally more happy than I have been for years. The only side-effect I have experienced is a slight drowsiness beginning about an hour before I go to bed.
For anyone who has severe, chronic, debilitating anxiety, and is willing to take this drug AS PRESCRIBED, I can only offer my own experience as a full-hearted endorsement for the responsible use of benzodiazepines (such as Clonazepam). I have experienced no cognitive impairments, as my performance at school can attest to."

I've tried about 5 sleep meds, and 4 other benzos and this is the only one I tolerate well without side-effects and it helps me relax so I can fall into a normal sleep pattern. I have to up my dose as you can build up a tolerance after a while, other than that I love it. On a side-note, it can kill your sex drive.  Also to the guest that asked if you can inject, no you can't. But you can get a dissolve under the tongue pill that is faster acting for panic attacks.

I have fibromyalgia, a rare disorder called Dercum's Disease and severe restless leg syndrome.  I was feeling very restless and jumpy during the day due to insomnia from constant pain and RLS.  I have been taking a low dose of Clonazepam .5 x3 at bedtime for 2 months.  My anxiety has decreased, my pain level seems more bearable and to my surprise my Restless Legs has improved.  I never thought I'd find something to help that.  Over the past 30 years I have tried just about every drug under the sun to relieve RLS and this is the first thing that has made any difference.  I did have some of the side effects the first month but now don't notice any side effects.

The sicknesses that you are experiencing when you do not take your clonazepam is withdrawal. Please discuss this with your physician as soon as possible, as withdrawal from any kind of benzodiazepine can be very dangerous. Your doctor may want to slowly taper you off of this drug before trying another that might work better for you!

Good Luck!"

My life seems on a wierd even keel, with a flatter affect, less likely to do outdoor stuff and feel more housebound, with some anger issues. I feel it does work for the panic and for the anxiety and sleep. I like, others am scared for when I no longer have insurance and ability to pay. Does seem to help with perception of pain working in conjunction with Lortab 7.5, Baclofin, Tramadol, and Ibuphrophen 600. Am happy mostly but dislike the drugged feeling in the daytime.

Within about 3 months I finished a bottle in a day, just to function. I needed it to sleep, to avoid withdrawal which included panic attacks worse than I started with, to be around people, to socialize, to go a day without freaking out. I chewed them to kick in faster, and since they taste okay I had no problem chewing 5 or 6 at a time. This drug brought me to my knees faster than anything and along with xanax, was the reason I decided to get sober. I don't think my history of addiction contributed to the addiction I experienced with this drug, because it is known for making all types of people dependent on it. I would avoid this entire class of drugs for anxiety and stick to neurontin, depending on severity. Or take it only for emergencies or before bed. No good. 
497$Condition: Panic Disorder$6/5/2010 1:06:39 PM$Reviewer: Happy Girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I have PTSD and this medication for anxiety and it helps me a great deal. Before I started taking it, I never knew what it was like to not have anxiety. It was so bad every day. With this medication I have been able to live a much more normal life and not having the anxiety is great! I am not a fan of taking any long term medication, but with my anxiety being SO bad, this has been a great thing for me. Finally a semi-normal life! It works great for me. The only side effects I have are some clumsiness and about 30 minutes after taking it I get a little sleepy but after that it is pretty much a normal life! I am so greatful.

I have only been on it for 2 months. My concern is that I want to come off. I tried coming off of Adavan and ended up in the hospital with tremors, ect. I did not know these medications were so addicting. I would really like to come off of them and see how I do. I feel tired all the time and I don't like that feeling. But on the flip side it has controlled the panic tremendously and allowed me to live a normal life free from anxiety attacks.

For the first couple months I did not have panic attacks but it clouded my mind severely. I had trouble driving straight and I fell down a flight of stairs (literally bouncing off every step with my rear). It would've been funny if the situation weren't so tragic @ the time). After just 2 months of taking it I felt no relief and no side effects. It was like taking a placebo pill-it did nothing. I never became addicted. It was no problem for me to get off of. My dr was weening me off but I would skip several days and would be fine. My body is resistant to benzos but have seen A LOT of people having a hard time getting off.

They kept telling me i had leg jerks when i was sleeping and put me on several meds with no help. It got worse over time and my Dr. finally sent me to a nurologist and he finally after 2 years of suffering diagnosed me. he put me on Clonazepam 1mg. (5 times a day) 1 in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, 1 in the evening if needed, and 1 or 2 if i did not take my afternoon dose, at bedtime.. Now I sleep throught the night and do not shake during the day. It worked!!

I took it for one day. 5 days later, I'm still working to get it out of my system. I don't remember most of the past 5 days. I'm getting better, but this has been a harsh lesson to learn: research all medicine (and dosages) before just assuming your doctor has given you what's right for you.

The reason i say this is it is very habit forming. When you have taking it for a long time you have trouble getting off of it. My dr. wonts to take me off of it. I have tryed once and i through i was going crazy. I was having withdrawls so bad that i had to call her and go in. She was scared that i might hurt my self. But i knew it was the medican that was making me feel that way so i would tell myself it was just the medican. My dr. didn't know how to get me off so i wrote the company that makes it was told they didn't know how the help me. I am back on it now. I don't like being on something i can't get off of and the company can't help . They can sell . I got on the web site and try to find someone who might could. I got a lot of answered about it was hard to come off of it but if you could go throw the withdrawls it would take a while. I may try again but not sure i can go throw the withdrawls.  They said that if you was able to get off you may not be able to stay off of it. This is just what i thank. But if you need it take it for a short time or ask for something else. If you are trying to come off it good luck. Try not to get in any hurry just take it one day at a time.

After reading others comments about it,  I am concerned about the (addiction)  Am I addicted?  I have gone without it for a week or so at a time a couple of times, the only problems I noticed was everyday without, the more my head jerking was a problem at night.  My Doc gave me Gabapentin in place of it once (cause I thought it wasn't working any more) but that did absolutly nothing.  So I went back to the clonepin.  The only problems I have had with it is I Sierious lower back issues and am on about 13 differnt meds, from fentynol patches (75mcg), morphine, oxycodine and Soma, soon lyrica.  I just can't take my soma with it.
But I couldn't sleep without it! Love it.  Just concerned about the 'addiction problems' I have read about.  My Doc has never said anything about it.

648$Condition: Other$10/27/2009 5:19:43 AM$Reviewer: chawles, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$"It was hard getting my doctor to prescribe a benzo, as I don't have panic disorder but rather an often debilitating social anxiety. Im taking .5mg 2x a day, a very low dose that belies how effective it's been for me.

In social situations I no longer feel like I'm always doing or saying embarrassing or stupid things; my speech and behaviors are no longer inhibited by a perceived omnipresent public scrutiny. When I drink now, it's not a desperate move to ""prep"" myself for a meeting or party. Instead it's for my own enjoyment. 

In class I engage the professors regularly (often zealously with my opinions) and have become good friends with some of them. I do find it difficult at first to stay awake when it kicks in during a class, but I had that problem before the clonazepam. Perhaps the only negative aspect is the memory loss, an effect I perceive probably more than most people, being a student. The gaps in information, when they exist, are generally negligible anyway.

I've been on 200mg Zoloft for years now (for the aforementioned anxieties and OCD), and yet I always felt that my symptoms weren't completely resolved. Though I am aware of the fleeting nature of benzodiazepines' anxiolytic effects, I have come to terms with the possibility of being on such a drug for a long time. Unless it leads to abuse, the benefits far outweigh the costs of klonipin. I am a better person now, because I don't have to live in fear."

Originally was perscribed 1mg 3x a day.  I only took 1 a day at first and seemed to get a little better after 4-5 days.  Then it was the weekend and I slept through most of that holiday weekend. I thought I should take 2 since I was perscribed 3 a day and after 2 days of that I was groggy all day at work and even fell asleep at work briefly.  After about 9-10 days of taking, I became a disoriented, walking zombie.  
After leaving a work party (w/literally 2 sips of wine) at approx. 7:30, I fell asleep on the train ride home (which happened often while taking the medicine but never before in many years of riding the train).  The conductor woke me up and I knew I was a little tired but never thought I was too bad to drive.  I was leaving a (thankfully) nearly empty train station parking lot and blacked out or fell asleep and crashed my car into a cement light fixture.  It knocked me awake and I thought someone hit me and looked around and there was no one in sight.  That was a Thursday, that weekend I tried 3 (as perscribed) and slept most of the weekend and was groggy for a couple days after discontinuing med altogether.  I stopped the med and called the dr but she was on vacation.  A couple weeks later she had me try much lower dose (.125 mg 2 - 3 x day) but it still made me tired but not as bad and didn't seem to notice any real positives."

It all started about a year ago.  I was out of work for 2 months on medical leave.  I take the drug with 100mg of Zoloft daily and I am a new person.  I was never socially active but now I can't get enough.  I am a totally different person and I no longer have anxiety or panic attacks.  I only take .25mg in the morning and afternoon but it does it's job.  The only side effect is once in awhile I get dizzy when I turn my head but I can live with that.  I recommend this drug to anyon but only in small doses.  When I was at the height of my depression and close to being hospitalized, I was on 2mg and it really effected my motor skills.  I was also on Lerezapam for anxiety and sleep.  You take one pill and 20 minutes you are sleeping very soundly.  Nothing could wake you.  Very good drug while you are getting out of depression and anxiety.

It has the ability to completely destroy anxiety and panic, and may seem like the perfect drug at first.  However, you will develop a tolerance and continue to raise your dose until you reach a point where the drug no longer works for you.  It will cause you problems the longer you take it and the higher your dose gets.  This drug is highly physically addictive and can cause severe and painstaking withdrawal if discontinued, even gradually.  Please be careful and do your research before taking this drug.

714$Condition: Panic Disorder$7/17/2009 3:54:32 PM$Reviewer: feeling desperate, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$4$"Clonazepam worked very well the first week. I could sleep for 6 hrs and not wake up in a state of panic with a racing heartbeat.  My anxiety symptoms were calmer too.  But after a week I started feeling general anxiety about situations where I normally have just a little uneasiness.   As the 2nd week went on.. my anxiety grew stronger and stronger.. but when I hit a state of panic attack the drug kicks in and I feel calmer and don't feel the emotional effects of the panic attack.  I do have the racing heartbeat though.. so I take a beta blocker (propanolol) to help slow it down a bit. I was still able to sleep. Until two nights ago when my anxiety about being able to get to my doctors appointment on time woke me up too early.   then I spoke with the doctor about my symptoms and he said I was having daily anxiety withdrawal as the drug started to wear off the next morning.  He switched me to tazepam but the pharmacy wants 430 dollars for 60 pills... who can afford that? The doctor also put me on Citalopram 10 mg yesterday for 6 days and then go to 20 mgs after that.  I took my first pill last night and woke up early so I have insomnia and feel very tired and am subject to anxiety still.  I would like to get off clonazepam soon so I can get some sleep and not feel so exhausted and vulnerable.  
For short term use.. 2 to 3 weeks, this drug is okay. For long term use.. I suggest you use something else."

I have found it very satisfying so far. I have been on other benzo's in the past, such as Zanax and that just made me loopy and tired. Clonopine works immediately but just takes that edge off when I feel the anxiety rising up within me. Plus they taste kind of minty so I just let them disolve under my tongue so that it gets through your system faster. The only thing that makes me nervous is that it can be very habit forming and I have problems with addiction.

784$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/22/2009 7:13:16 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$4$I started experiencing panic attacks for the first time in my life about a month and a half ago.  I didn't sleep for about 1 week.  My doc put me on serequel 100mg. each night and clenazepam .5 3x daily.  The panic attacks are gone, though I do feel the initial symptoms arize every now and than I can calm myself so it doesn't escalate.  The serequel helped me get my sleep back on track too.  I have recently lessened my clenazepam dosage to 2 pills per day, I did have irritabiliby side affects from this change.  My doc wants me to lessen to 1 pill soon.  I may have same side affects as before, but just hope and pray that the panic attacks do not return.  I think I have learned some things that I can do to calm myself, but I'm not sure if what I have learned has helped or if it's just the meds.  I guess I'll find out as we take more of the meds back down.

It has helped in conjunction with light anxiety.  My only complaint is it's habit forming.  When I try to come off the med, it is very difficult.  I am now again trying to come off by gradually reducing my dosage from 3 per day to 2 per day to 1 per day over a three week period.  It takes approx. seven days for this drug to clear my system.  Though I have had success with the drug, overall I find it has affected my personality in the form of lethargy, lack of mental sharpness, and just an overall drugged out feeling.  If I can get off, I never want to take it again.
786$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/19/2009 10:57:56 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$It is hard to explain. One day at work I FELT LIKE I WAS HAVING A STOKE. I was 35 years old.I HAD CHILLS,RIGHT SIDE WAS NUMB. I ASKED MY BOSS TO CALL AN AMBULANCE SHE WOULD NOT SO I DROVE MYSELF TO HOSPITAL. As I was walking to my CAR MY FEET FELT RUBBERY BUT I MADE IT TO MY CAR. AT HOSPITAL THEY DID AN MRI THE NEXT DAY ALL WAS FINE.As time went on I would have this feeling in the lower chest where the rib cage comes together. I JUST COULD NOT FUNCTION. I would have to go and lay down and a few hours later I would be ok. I took many trips to er with same results. They could find nothing wrong.I had all the tests MRI,CAT SCAN, BLOOD WORK, CERTAIN URINE TESTS,EKG,EEG,STREss TEST ALL WAS GOOD. SO i TRIED ANOTHER DOCTOR SAME RESULTS. Finally a doctor sent me to a psychiatrist. He put me on .5 mg klonopin one at bedtime. That was it I was cured. But I worry about dependency. So I stopped taking it after a month and the feeling in chest came back, my legs would feel weird and I just felt like I was going to pass out. I am happy go lucky I do not understand. But another psychiatrist said it is how my body handles stress even though you do not realize you are stressed. so he put me on clonazepam .5 mg one a day but i only take as needed. I have been taking for 10 years but the key is take as needed. I take half .5 mg pill as needed. I use about 60 pills a year taking a half pill when needed.That would be .25 mg. Which would be 120 doses a year.The doctor says take one pill a day but I will not afraid of dependency so i take as needed maybe 3x  aweek  it varies. I have not had a trip to ER since. I still feel stressed at times but the pill seems to do the trick. If i took one .25 every day maybe I would be fine all the time but I believe I would have to up the doseage as time went by and eventually it would no longer work. The doctor said he cannot see how .25 when needed works but if it does ok. Believe me it works.

My Dr told me to self-medicate, as I never require more than 3 a day.  I've cut myself to 2 daily (am and pm).  Originally I was given Xanax, and I was taking 5-6 a day, and felt doped all the time.  This has been a great mood leveller.  I still get stressed, but the physical anxiety and panic symptoms are drastically reduced, if not gone.  I am growing concerned about dependency.  Make sure if you're on this, you're getting bi-annual blood work done.

Dont stop taking it without consulting your doctor because last time i tried i could not sleep and go the worst night sweats and hot flashes during the day.  I have also noticed if I take it everyday like they say, the medication no longer works for ""emergency"" dosing for more severe panic attacks.

It even discusses it in the side effects and has happened to a dear friend of mine through the last few years!!  Pharmacists said it did NOT cause hair loss....but...here, in WEBMD, the side effect IS ""EXCESSIVE HAIR LOSS"".....or GROWTH!!!!!  BE AWARE OF SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS.....VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!"
844$Condition: Other$1/4/2009 7:00:49 PM$Reviewer: Marie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was experiencing restless legs syndrome in the middle of the night and also just general trouble sleeping (waking up in the middle of the night and having problems getting back to sleep). My doctor suggested Clonazepam might help with both instead of prescribing two separate drugs. For several months, I slept though the whole night without waking. Now I general wake up due to noises, bathroom breaks, but I have no problem getting back to sleep immediately. No more restless leg problems either except for a couple times when I didn't take a pill. Also, if something important is  happening tomorrow and I might have problems getting back to sleep, I just take two tablets. I have no problems getting up in the morning. I read about some possible problems being on this drug so long but so far, so good. It's like a wonder drug for me.

I would have panic attacks at work/home etc. Since I have been taking this medication I have noticed a big difference in how I react to things. My family and Co-workers have noticed a difference too. I am satisfied with this medication and would recommend it to people who do suffer from panic attacks. I have had no major side affects. At first I experienced some drowsiness but now that I am use to it that has went away. It is also affordable with or without insurance.

BEWARE of the addictiveness of this drug, as I was told it isn't addictive, but it very much is.  It worked for many years, but about 3 yrs. ago the panic attacks intensified, and I also developed severe clinical depression, which I am now on disability for.  I have had a hard time finding a Dr. that will admit that the long term use could be CAUSING the depression, which is something I've never had problems with, and then helping me find something else that will work.  If you start this drug, don't ever try to go off of it cold turkey!!!  I'm doing it very slowly, without the help of a Dr..  Can't see any sense in taking something that's not working.  Like I said, it worked for many years.  Also, make sure you find a Dr. who does liver function tests, etc. regularly. In 20+ years, my Dr. has never checked mine once, and from what I'm learning, that is very important.  I recently had blood work done, and am praying for good results.

I was prescribed Vicoden ES , Ibuprofen 800 mg Nexium and some muscle relaxant like Zanaflex. Because of the severe pain and muscle spasms I had very hard time falling a sleep or staying a sleep, The treating doctor prescribed different Sleeping pills including Halciaon , ambien and some other sleeping pills but none worked for me. So I was prescribed 1 MG of Clonazepam for sleep. The clonazepam alone did not help me but taking it together with Halcion made me sleep. It was around 2001 or 2002 from that time to now I had about eight spine surgeries and disk removed and bones fused. Nothing took care of the pain. So I was referred to a pain management Doctor there I was put on Oxycotin, Oxycodone and Morphine this was around 2006. Then I had another lower back sugary and I felt a little better and decided to drop off some of my medication with in a week I was able to quit every thing but Not Clonazepam It was and is almost impossible to quit this drug. I gave it up for about one week and I could not stand up, was always shaking could not hold a cup or anything and could not walk straight I went to my pain mgmt. He told me I don’t have to quit clonazepam because it was a very small dose 
So regardless of need or not I could not quit Clonazepam. Now all the side effects in the book are working on me but I can’t quit. I strongly oppose giving this type of medication to a patient with sleep disorder. Yes my life is like hell can’t do with it or without just read the severe side effects and imagine being living with them by the way all my back pain came back 2 months after the last surgery.To all my co-patients don't take this unless you have the problems it is primarily made for.

This is when I started Clonazepam(Klonopin) and was started at 1mg 4/day.  My body built up a tolerance and I got to the point where I was taking up to 20mg/day just to stay leveled.  I tried going off of it and went through hell and now I just take whatever whenever just to avoid the withdrawal hell.  This med no longer helps and my dr. feels bad cuz I'm only 24 yrs old and he rerets putting me on any form of benzo at my age.  I wish I would've done more research, but its too late now.  I don't recommend this or any benzo to anyone, but as for me I am surprised benzos are even legal drugs through prescription.  That whole category, if you do the research, is one of the worst groups of meds above narcotics and sedatives.  I'm at the point now where I don't know if my miserable depression, anxiety, and fatigue as well as health issues are because of the Clonazepam or what, but I know once I became dependent on it I was done.  I feel awful and embarrased and I feel like an addict despite never misusing or even trying street drugs because when I try to go without it ITS PURE HELL so I give in and take at least 1-2mg/day to keep it in my system.

I ended up on 2mg of Clonazepam a day.  I took that for about 2 weeks after almost 3 months on Lorazepam.  A new pcp decided to cut my dosage down to .25mg a day all at once.  The withdrawal started immediately.  It has not been too bad yet but I'm only in my 5th day.  On the second day I just stopped taking it altogether since it was doing nothing for me anyway (the withdrawal symptoms create their own anxiety).  However, while on this drug, I did not have a single panic attack.  I did experience moderate to severe dizziness at times (especially on standing rapidly or moving my head too quickly) and a severe loss of appetite.  I thought that bad at first but discovered that eating very small portions more often allowed me to gain my appetite back.  Since I was overweight to begin with, this turned out to be good as I have lost nearly 20 pounds.  I have read from others that they take doses only when they feel a full panic attack coming on rather than routinely to combat constant anxiety.  I will be attempting that if I actually have a full blown panic attack.  I'm close a lot of the time right now but know that much of it is withdrawal.  I would recommend that, if you have been prescribed this medication for routine, daily dosage that you talk with your doctor about changing to an ""as needed"" drug to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms.  Also, avoid alcohol when you've taken this.  It really knocks me for a loop.  All in all, it is a decent drug but the addiction factor really needs to be considered before taking.

We hired a handyman to fix a leak in the master bedroom before we moved in. We came to check on his progress and found he had completely gutted the entire house! The lathe and plaster walls, the antique tile floors and counters,  sinks, toilets...everything. The whole house was in a pile in the backyard, taller than the house. I had to go to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack. They gave me 0.5mg. of clonazepam to take as needed. One pill at night made me terribly angry in the morning. Violently angry. The next day I took a quarter of a pill, same result. Tried again the third day, whole pill, when I woke in the morning I couldn't focus my eyes very well. My eyesight went from 20/20 to 20/200! They had me stop the drug immediately of course, and are scheduling tests to see what went wrong. There may be no connection, but just in case, ask your doctor!

The Klonopin itself is a life saver because it calms me down enough that I can get a decent night's sleep.  The only thing unfortunate about it is that I am sometimes drowsy if I don't get at least 8 hours of sleep (as with any sleeping pill).  I don't take it if I've been drinking or have taken Benadryl for my allergies so I have never had withdrawal sympotoms or adverse side effects.

Given the the dosage prescribed (.5mg), I didn't think it was going to work, given that I was taking 40 mg of Prozac.  Upon taking the first pill I noticed a different within an hour; I slept liek a baby for the first time in years.  When I work up, I felt such a sense of calm that it pleased me--yet frighted me-at the same time.  I went to work for the FIRST TIME with a PLEASANT DISOPSITON; I didn't need to get two martinis at lunchtime in order to get through the rest of the day.  I wasn't SNAPPING OFF at my family that evening. Granted, by the FOURTH TABLET I began feeling quite lightheaded, walking somewhat wobbly.  I ate a good breakfast and some fruit and relaxed.  Of all the meds I have taken over the past eleven years, I have found this one to be working (so far so good). As for the possibility of becoming addicted to the meds, I been through enough enough addictions to such meds that I force my self to rise above it--because I want to get better.  I don't feel I'm in the place to recommend this to anyone; what can be one person's Nirvana can be another person's Purgatory. If you have a good doctor (Primary, Psycologist, other) whom you feel you can trust and will prescribe a med that will work for you (and only YOU), go for it.  But always remember and don't ever forget--the meds are'nt going to solve whatever problems triggering your symptoms--YOU ARE.

I am so sorry I ever took that first pill...I began having problems from the start but didn't think it was the drug and the doctor didn't seem to know what I was experiencing was coming from the drug either.  I would get extremely lightheaded, so much so I could barely function; all I wanted to do was lay around because I had no energy or interest in doing anything, even the most simple things became difficult to do. It also numbs you emotionally and my mind and memory have been dulled.  Take anything but this drug.  No one explained to me that this drug is a class that is not like antidepressants, but it's a hynotic drug.  It should be used ONLY for very severe cases of panic or seizures...not for anxiety like I have and even then for only short periods of time...two-4 weeks. Please don't let anyone talk you into taking this drug.  You willl find it's a living hell if you ever want to come off of it.  From the things I have read, everyone who has tried to come off of it has had horrible experiences with withdrawal due to your whole nervous system being dependent upon it.  Your body is no longer able to function normally.  Your brain no longer manufactures its own hormones because this drug has taken over.  It will take a long time for your brain to begin to make it's own again.  Other organs are affected, also.  I would like to convince the whole world of the dangers of this drug and tell them that any doctor who puts you on it, find another doctor.

If your doctor prescribes this medication for Restless Leg Syndrome, don't use it. You can purchase Vitamin B Complex and it will resolve the symptoms naturally. I was on clonazepam for 10 years before I discovered Vitamin B Complex, and I am so addicted to it, that it takes a very long time to wean yourself off. You must do it crumb by crumb, and week by week. Otherwise you will experience horrific side effects of withdrawal from the medication. I've also tried Requip for RLS, but had extremely vivid dreams and quit immediately.
Try Vitamin B Complex first, and see if it doesn't work for you for RLS.  The clonazepam is extremely addictive and almost impossible to get off of, certainly impossible to quit cold-turkey. "

It works great for many symptoms, especially panic/anxiety; however, your body slowly develops a tolerance for the drug, meaning that you will ultimately have to take more and more for it to demonstrate efficacy, which could push the dosage into dangerous areas.  I believe that around 1.5mg - 2mg has addictive potential, so just be careful.  Also, if you have reached the aforementioned threshold of addictiveness, be VERY careful when trying to get off of Klonopin.  The withdrawal symptoms can be very serious - even deadly (seizures, &c.) - so do not precipitously stop taking the drug.  It is, however, the best long-acting benzo on the market.

Within 30 mins I was calm and back to my normal self. Went home and had some of the best sleep I ever had in my whole life. Some much overdue rest. The medicine does work good but I am not going to rely on it everytime I fell stress coming on only when I feel I am about to have a bad panic attack ONLY!!!

We lost our home and a lot of family to death and murder at this time and I was in dire need of help. 

I was given Lorazepam for a few months, but it was more situational.. Seriosuly, I was so stressed it was at a point of rage in traffic, etc. By the time I needed the lorazepam to work it was too late so my Dr. then prescribed my clonazepam. The quality of life I gained from this medicine is just tremendous. I was previously prescribed Lexapro, which I also believe is a life saver for me. But the Clonazepam is what really turned life around. Together I am a strong healthy woman able to cope with everything.

My only complaint is after 3 yrs of using this medicine I recently was forced to abruptly stop the medicine due to my dr not refilling it (okaying it) after 5 days without it I had tremors so bad, I was unable to control my muscles, I was rigid and had a lot of stress on my heart and had a hard time breathing. I was moving towards convulsions right before I was able to receive my medicine. I have no history of seisure disorders.. 

I HIGHLY recommend you do NOT run out of this medicine, or abruptly stop taking it without the help of your doctor. Certainly don't let yourself run out and it take so long to get a response/refill for your medicine like my experience. Not to frighten anyone. Do listen to your Dr, do not stop it abruptly. 

Even after all of that, I maintain this medication is a life saver for me.     "

I unfortunately drove my self to the hospital to get checked out, once everything checked out, the doctor though he would try this for what he considered a panic attack. I thought it was the two pots of coffee I was drinking each day, no breakfast and no lunch for years. I primarily used for what I considered heart palpitations and to much coffee, helped a lot during stressful moments, meetings, public speaking, calming the nerves during stressful situations was the main effect. Not sure, after taking for three years, went from one, then two and then to three tablets a day 0.5mg, two first off in the morning prior to work, one on the way home, prior to meeting the family and kids.

What many doctors won't tell you is that it is excruciating to get off of.
I was weaned off the medicine this past fall and it was the worst experience of my life.  After being on the med for 10 years, my body loved it and screamed for it when it was no longer available.
I withstood feelings of suicide, a constant ""out-of-body"" sensation, lethargy, dehydration and rapid weight loss.  The withdrawal was so severe, I ended up in the hospital because of the dehydration and lack of appetite.
I'm now 45 days off the medicine and finally feeling strong for the first time in a long time.  I finally feel like I've kicked the drug and I wouldn't go back on it for any amount of money.  
This was the most difficult experience in my 51 years of life."

I have one small complaint though...when I miss a dose, I have severe dizziness and find it very hard to get through the day...it makes me feel physically ill if I don't take this medicine.  I wish I knew this side effect before I started taking it...hopefully this post helps someone else ask the right questions before taking this medicine.

On average 5 days per week. I am always careful to not rely too much on the drug.It is good to have something that relieves tne anxiety and following panic attacks when needed. It improves the quality of my life.Be careful where it is kept. Many know that this medication is abused by some and has street value. I wish it came in a time realease.

Take with caution, I find it's easy to rely on.  Always get a second or third opinion if you disagree with the doseage.

1101$Condition: Other$9/18/2007 2:28:05 PM$Reviewer: collettejeanne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been under a tremedous amount of stress, so my doctor gave it to me for my anxiety. My anxiety has caused my blood pressure to skyrocket. I have always had normal blood pressure. I take the medication, and it calms me down so I can handle the every day things that are making my life so hard to deal with. I do not like to take any medications as a rule, but I feel for right now, this is what I need. Either that or end up hospitalized for having something serious happen due to the blood pressure. Hopefully things will soon get back on track(I am in the mortgage business,hense the stress) 
1102$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/18/2007 2:10:37 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$This medication was given to me by my PCP, most likely based on poor judgement. It instantly threw me into a heavy depression, and worsened my condition. I was unnable to move, or get out of bed, or go to work or eat for five days. I felt hopeless, listless, and chronicly sleepy/drowsy. I even took a Provigil one of those days in an attempt to stay awake and fell asleep anyways. I quickly decided to discontinue the use of this medication. It was prescribed to me for anxiety and I highly recommend that if your PCP prescribes this to you for that reason, take it as needed as opposed to the dosing I was instructed to follow which was two 0.5 mg pills daily, in addition to 20 mg Lexapro which I am considering coming off of as well. --Not to mention, none of this helped to ease my anxiety.
