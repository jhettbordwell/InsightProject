3$Condition: Calming of Pediatric Patient by Administration of Sedative$12/1/2008 7:49:55 AM$Reviewer: sally, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$2$1$i found this drug helped me alot why i was taking them, it would be great if they could make a drug out there with the same affect with no addiction. Now that im off them im going trough withdrawrals i dont recomend this drug unless you take it properly. it has been difficult because i took advantage of this drug. i will try to stay off them from now on.
