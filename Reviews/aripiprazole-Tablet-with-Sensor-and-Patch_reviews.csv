5$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$1/19/2015 2:14:01 PM$Reviewer: Woody, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I spent 20 years looking for a drug to relieve my depression.. I tried several classes of antidepressants with no or minimal relief. I am currently taking bupropion and escitalopram with several other mood drugs. Once we added Abilify a great weight was lifted. I am able to function now, which I was not able to. I love it. I have little or no side effects.

Not only do the problems it was to help with still exists now there is a myriad of side effects that are very serious and debilitating. I would be afraid for anyone who is entertaining it....not sure why FDA approved this Rx . I wouldn't suggest even for someone I didn't like.

17$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$11/25/2010 9:09:28 PM$Reviewer: mswilson,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $3$1$1$My 55 year old father was recently taken off Respridol and put on Abilify. In two weeks time he has lost mobility. He complains of stiff muscles in his legs. He looks like hes ice skating when he's trying to walk, unable to pick up his feet. He's not sleeping and even though i have to hold him up to walk, he still has the urge to get up and walk around every 10-15 mins. It's scary and sad to see my father like this. His eyes that were once bright and twinkled now look dull, dead and aged. The slight change in his mood swings aren't worth all of the side effects!

Only prob was I was TOO motivated, it was like I had restless BODY syndrome. I may be the only person who had this reaction, but I broke out in huge hives all over my body. We couldn't figure out what it was until I quit taking Abilify. *If it hadn't been for the hives, I'd still be on it. The restless feeling was definitely worth the good moods.

36$Condition: Schizophrenia$5/14/2009 4:16:10 AM$Reviewer: prozacplease, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$5$"This is a better treatment for bipolar,
schizophrenia is more of an incureable disease. The mood stablizing that this drug offers is useful when becomeing used to the symptoms associated with schizophrenia... 

It is not a cure all and there is no cure for something that is not caused by an chemical imbalance. However like I said it may ease the emotional symptoms, and cause weight gain etc."
