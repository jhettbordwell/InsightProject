0$Condition: Symptoms from Stopping Treatment with Opioid Drugs$8/9/2016 5:56:42 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was in a bad accident. Crushed my thoracic spinal nerves. No-one picked it up for 8 years until I found a great PM anaesthetist. He found 3 levels of crushed spinal nerves after 8 years of being misdiagnosed.Nerve ablation worked really well for me. I always knew it was physical pain Thought I would get better but just got worse. A friend of mine who is a med specialist couldn't believe the pain I was in. Advised me to see an anaesthetist. Wish I had found him first after 8 years of 24/7 pain. Have come down really fast from 80mgs 40mgs 80mgs oxycontin. Am now at 40mgs 40mgs 40mgs in less than one month. Makes my eyes dry and can't speak if I'm not chewing sugarless lollies or drinking water. Wake up every night round 2.30 to 3am take two, go back to sleep. Didn't realise they are addictive so will try one tonight. Never drive if I take one during a rough day. Makes me too tired. Didn't realise they cut down smoking. But at least can go hours without a smoke if I want to. My mum isn't well and have been able to help her instead of being locked in an addiction centre. My eyesight is crap though but don't think it was this med. Had to buy eyedrops and carry water everywhere. I probably feel a bit sick 'cause I still smoke. Wish my GP had told me they could help me quit smoking. Time for laser eye surgery again.
1$Condition: High Blood Pressure$5/31/2016 6:01:52 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$2$Was prescribed  0.2 mg. 2x daily. Taken for over 2 yrs. I hate feeling tired, no libido, wt. gain and overall feeling of lethargy. Dr. trying to wean me off with 0.1mg am and added 2.5 mg Norvasc am. Not too bad, some withdrawal symptoms but tolerable. DCEd am catapres and added 2.5 more Novasc. Someone SHOOT ME. The withdrawal symptoms are horrific! Dizzy, headaches, pounding heart, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. My Dr. states that they will go away hopefully within a few weeks, if I stay sane through this process. Hate to think what will happen when I go off the pm catapres. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD EVEN RECOMMEND THIS HORRIBLE DRUG!
2$Condition: High Blood Pressure$2/8/2016 12:39:39 PM$Reviewer: chris, 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$Works, but side effects take getting used to. I can't take diuretics or beta-blockers, and this is the most effective at controlling blood pressure of everything I've tried. Dry mouth and eyes are the worst side effects, but these are easily mitigated. If you're not used to it, though, that first pill will hit you like three martinis.
3$Condition: Extremely High Blood Pressure$10/29/2015 6:44:11 PM$Reviewer:  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Have been living with super high blood pressure for a long time, generally feeling like my head was ready to explode along with a weird sensation behind my eyes -  not pressure. Anyway every blood pressure medication made me terribly sick but I was always ready to try the next one, the one that always operated by a different mechanism. Finally, after a trail of failures, it was time for Lamotrigine. Frankly, it has changed my life entirely. At first I was just happy a week had passed without my throwing the pills away, feeling like I was going to die. I also suffered not a single side effect except some fatigue as my body adjusted to a non lethal blood pressure. In fact, my blood pressure dropped immediately to,a pretty normal range and has remained there. Along with with such a dramatic change in pressure I now have much more energy and now experience a sense of calmness rather than the constant anxiety 'for nothing' I had been living with for years. It's obvious that my experience seems to be atypical but in my case I'm overjoyed!

I was on 8 other BP meds but when the Doc added this one My BP remained high but I was afraid to go down the stairs I was so unsteady.

I was always terribly tired, dizzy, nauseated, I felt like I was in a continual narcotic withdrawal.

I read for some it works but for me it was a nightmare and the first drug I have ever refused. "

6$Condition: Symptoms from Stopping Treatment with Opioid Drugs$8/21/2015 10:59:05 AM$Reviewer: Praxix9, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I was in 2 near fatal car accidents over the past 6 years and was in pain management the entire time using all forms of narcotic medication including Dilaudid, OxyContin, Morphine and Opana. It was awful relying on these medications due to all the side effects, but they did control my pain. One day recently, I got sick of taking them. I asked my physician if I could taper off and he did so to prevent withdrawal. At my last visit, he suggested Clonidine to assist with controlling my migraines and possibly reduce my pain level. I started out on .1 BID and now take .2 TID. It is working pretty well. I have no opiate withdrawal, notable pain relief (not all, but noticeable) and I haven't had one migraine headache. The headaches were likely caused by the car wrecks and they were awful. Clonidine takes awhile to get used to. My only bad side effect is insomnia sometimes that may last for a few days, then I'll sleep normally. Clonidine assists with my pain, prevents opiate withdrawal and my migraine headaches.
7$Condition: High Blood Pressure$10/20/2014 3:52:14 PM$Reviewer: Sheryl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$2$5$I went into the Emergency Room with a BP of 170/131.  Yes, this drug dropped my BP very quickly, but I feel like a zombie.  I wish there was another drug that works as well without this side effect.  I tried to quit alcohol but found cold turkey is actually the worst thing to go through (in my opinion).  I was honest with the emergency Dr and Nurses and they were very understanding.  But they said my BP was way too high.  There are sooo many actual risks of going cold turkey that people do not realize.  Strokes, Seisures, heart attackes, so DONT try it alone.  Seek help if you want to come off any drug.  This is day 2 of me taking this drug Catapres, and it might have just saved my life.  I will put up with being drowsy.  My BP came down and has stayed down for 2 days.  I welcome the pills, the hell with the alcohol!

14$Condition: High Blood Pressure$1/27/2013 8:27:05 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$My high blood BP readings started one day just over a year ago.  After trying 9 medications with side effects to severe for me to handle, I was prescribed clonidine. I started out with one 0.1 mg per day which was then increased to 2 pills per day (0.1 mg) and am now taking 3 pills per day (0.1 mg).  This new dosage is working well but I hate to be on this medication after reading that it can cause glaucoma.  The problem for me is that I'm one of those patients who is allergic to many medications and clonidine is the only one I can handle.  My side effects are dry mouth and chest discomfort with pain down my left arm from time to time but compared to the severe migraines, diarrhea and dizziness while on 9 other BP meds, this one is fantastic.  I would just caution people to research the glaucoma side effect.  Glaucoma leads to blindness.  Is there anyone out there who has found a similar anti-hypertensive high BP medicine with fewer side effects?  Most high BP meds have terrible side effects including eventual kidney damage and diabetes.  Surely there must be something safer out there for us to use!!

this worked well except for ususl side affects    
low energy,constipation,drowsy,weight gain, especially fat. if u look this med up on wikapeda u will find that this med actually blocks body ablity to use or breakdown fat. Check it out for yourself.  Clonidine or catapress is also hard to get off of. Rebound high bp, n/v.severe headache could result in death or stroke if stoppped to abruptly. Know what meds ur taking.KNOWLEDGE IS POWER !

I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I was put on oral Meds and began using meter to check my levels. Was already restricting carbs and exercising. Discovered my levels were consistently normal 2 hrs after lunch, dinner and at bedtime, but upon rising and 2 hours after breakfast were extremely high. I only took Clonidine at bed time. Googled and found several articles suggesting this adverse result. Did not find it in most posts. Eliminated dose one night and following morning blood sugar normal. As Clonidine was not controlling bp well I will seek other solutions. I'll continue testing blood sugar for a while but looks like I wasted $$$ on dietitians, Meds and testing supplies. "

Within an hr. after taking I am either asleep or fighting to stay awake!  Voice hoarse, constantly clearing throat, dry mouth, weakness, lethargic, nightmares.  BP sometimes drops too low.  Was in hospital for arrythmia, DR. stopped my Catapres suddenly and after two days my BP spiked dangerously high...had to go back on it immediately.   Am sensitive to meds & this does control my BP but side affects are troublesome.   Effectiveness appears to be wearing off the last few months for BP control. Muscle cramps and nightmares are increasing. I also take Norvasc and took Cordorone for about 6 years (have been taken off this one for arrythmia but is taking months to get it out of my system....been off 8 months).  Cordorone affected my thyroid, teeth & gums, hair, muscle tone, stomach, reflux..... bad drug over time..wish I had known. I ask more questions now and am more persistent with DR. concerning my own observations concerning meds and side effects.  I keep a brief diary and it has been SO helpful to recognize  a pattern developing while taking meds and/or symptoms.

I am very tired of putting up with side effects, mainly tiredness and drowsiness(I take other meds that cause sleepiness). Being menopausal, I actually get MORE hot flashes and a stinging feeling around my head. I also think it makes my fibromyalgia worse or at least adds joint pain to it. and then there is the itching (which is a transient symptom of FMS but seems more often especially if I throw a new or different drug in the equation.) It just has many side effects. I intend to try to ween off it but all antihypertensives have their side effects and often don't work. just bang my head against a wall! I am hypersensitive to drugs and very discouraged as I sit here itching!

Since then I've changed PCP's and they have tried to change me from Catapres to the ""new"" drugs only to have my BP get out of control. The generic seems to work, though not as well as the original name brand. If anyone is having with feeling tired, I suggest talking with your dr about adjusting your dosage to maybe twice a day instead of once as Catapres lowers your BP quickly. Since I've taken it for such a long time, I monitor my BP and adjust the dosage when necessary."

My results were:

When I first use the patch or take the pill it effectively drops my blood pressure.  The side effects are so bad that I can't do my work.  Falling asleep while trying to write computer code doesn't exactly make my boss happy.

After I have been taking the medication a few weeks, it has less of an effect on my blood pressure.  I remember one instance when at the doctors they took my blood pressure.  They said 175/110 was too high, put me in a dark room and started feeding me 0.1 mg clonadine tablets.  They did this on the hour for 4 hours.  At the end of that time, they let me go and my BP was 165/115.  I guess I just built up a resistance to it.

By the way, there is a machine by the name of BioZ that can and is used to diagnose WHY you have high blood pressure.  Just do a internet search for ""BioZ hypertension"" and you will find it.  I like wikipedia myself."

I just began this medication to control my high blood pressure and my syncope. I take this twice per day at exactly the smae time everyday which can be a bit of a hassle.

It also had the wonderful side effect of inducing nearly irresistible drowsiness. I would even say that it is significantly more effective for inducing sleep than any benzodiazepine or eszopicline derivatives currently on the market.
