0$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/9/2019 12:43:38 PM$Reviewer: I Need A Vacation, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$3$I've been on this for 5 days now and all I want to do is sleep. Have a difficult time getting out of bed in the morning. I don't feel depressed but I'm still agitated with everything.  I feel like I'm in a fog and cant think clearly.  I started out with 50mg until last night and now I'm on 100mg.  Still feel groggy and I've noticed that I can't talk without stumbling.  I think I'm going to call my doctor and request a different drug.  I just don't feel right on this. Have a dry mouth and throat, tired, head fog, agitated feeling, dizzy and just overall not feeling well. In the past the drugs that worked the best didn't make me feel like this at all.  They worked great from the start but eventually stopped working which is why I'm on this one.  Need a replacement. 
1$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/21/2019 9:25:19 PM$Reviewer: sail2sunset, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Doctor originally ordered 100 mg. That was too strong for me. Now using 50 mg and find the effect is soothing. I don't notice many side effects. I take several meds so I often have dry mouth.

3$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/1/2017 2:25:24 PM$Reviewer: gramcracker, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$3$5$I've been on this medication for 1-1/2yrs. At first it was awesome, my moods stabilized almost immediately;about 6 mo. ago I started gaining weight, feeling listless, too much sleep and most recently more ups and downs. my dr. keeps telling me this is normal and I should just go on a diet and start exercing to keep my weight down; almost impossible when you just can't find the ambision to do so; I also have high blood pressure and high cholesterol since taking it so now i'm on med's for that too...my moods are starting to become more down than up so the dr. told me to go see a therapist. I've been seeing therapists for 5 yrs. now and they are all the same; not interested in going back to one; i'll just live with this and hope for the best

I would suggest this medication to anyone suffering from bipolar disorder or any other mental illness
5$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/23/2016 5:27:36 PM$Reviewer: I feel good, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$3$Started taking 200mg along with Lamectal. Within 20 minutes I was so tired I could hardly talk. I no longer had high/low but I felt like a zombie-no emotions at all, always tired and dragging, no desire to do anything. Decreased to 100mg and felt emotionally better but still had a hard time completing tasks. Here it is 7 years later with a new doctor. After learning more about the side effects I decided I had had enough. We made a plan to get off quetiapine- SLOWLY to prevent a manic/depressive episode. It took 6 months and I am totally off it. I had to retrain myself to fall asleep drug-free but I did it. I feel 100% better! My head's not foggy, I have energy, projects are actually getting completed. This does not feel like the manic highs I've experienced before. I just feel good. Like a new lease on life. Do your research and talk with your doctor before taking this drug.
6$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/21/2016 11:49:05 AM$Reviewer: Average New York Professional, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$"I'm at the two-week point. And while it's still a bit painful to get out of bed, once I do I no longer feel ""stoned."" There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

Days one through five were as follows: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg.  Then it was a matter of getting my body acclimated to 400 mg, which I thought would never happen. 

If you are able to take vacation/sick days/medical leave, I do suggest it. I did not. Either way, just know it does get better within a matter of weeks. "

8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/12/2016 12:59:48 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$2$This works for me as far as stabilizing my mood. However, I am extremely tired most of the time. For me, this medication requires that I get a minimum of 10 hours of sleep otherwise I simply can't get out of bed. I'm also thirsty frequently.

12$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/25/2014 6:53:48 PM$Reviewer: jemarigby, 25-34 Female  (Patient) $1$1$5$This is an extreamly dangerous drug that should be BANNED, i was being treated for depression related to my bipolar. i struggled with getting out of bed, doing chores going out was impossible but the most devastating was not being able to bond with my premature newborn that fought to be alive and i couldnt even hold her. i started taking quetiapine and within 5 days i became EXTREAMLY suicidal, the thoughts run round my head constantly until i took a near fatal overdose leaving me in intensivecare. i never felt suicidal before putting this poision in my body.

15$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/13/2013 7:48:22 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$This is an awful drug.  Top side effect is low sodium in blood, which I developed which could have killed me.  It also would have been nice if my doctor advised me to have regular blood tests.  I am off it and will never take again.

20$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/4/2009 5:44:56 PM$Reviewer: Blake_holiday, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$I'm pretty sure I'm gaining weight from taking this drug. My doctor originally told me to take one pill an hour before my bed time to help me sleep, and to take my mind off things. It put me out pretty quickly, but if I had to work early in the morning it some sometimes difficult for me to get out of bed.
21$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/9/2009 7:41:00 PM$Reviewer: feelbetter, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$Read til happy ending: The first 3 weeks on Seroquel was a roller-coaster nightmare with severe leg twitches, increase in irritability one day then worst depression the next, with an increase in suicidal thoughts too.  Sleep was heavy. But then there was a good day here and there. After 4 weeks, every day was a successful, functioning day with a more positive outlook from the deep depression. I take 150mg at 6pm and began Pristiq 50mg (changed from Lexapro) at 6am in morning. Six weeks in now and I feel like myself and have only experienced light moments of sadness. I'm amazed how much has changed and how fortunate I feel as a result of the meds.

I have gained 60 pounds, not a good thing.  Also, I have sever neuropathy in my feet and legs.  Quetiapine makes the pain in my feet much worse when I go to bed at night.  
Once I am asleep I am okay and I do not feel especially bad in the mornings.
I am not sure I am better off with this mediaction.

So far i only deal with thirst and a slight increase in appatite. When i first started taking it i dealt with a drug hangover but it has gotten better over time. It helps with sleep and dreams and some aggitation but i still battle with Bipolar 1 Disorder. For the most part i would reccomend it to others. It is a good drug.

I am a calmer person and have so much more patience with my kids and grandkids. Its hard for me because this medication is so costly sometime I don't have the money to purchase my meds.

28$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/11/2008 11:41:57 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Previously I had been treated with very limited success with: Lithium, Depacote, Triliptal, Risperdal, Lamictal, zoloft, Wellbutrin, Abilify, clonsepam, zypreza etc.  My exsistance was unbearable.  I went to a clinic and was taken off all the above.  I spent three weeks rapid cycling with psychotic features and devestating depressions and suicidality.  Within a week of starting Seroquel  my symptoms disappeared and have not returned in two years.  The possible side effects are frightening but nothing compares with the hell I lived with for nearly 20 years
