3$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/21/2016 8:14:09 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years$5$5$5$Just wish that the stigma didn't make it so hard for people, who need it, to get. Its not as though this has helped our country's drug epidemic. It really does help me be a more functional human being. Its like my brain waves normally vary from FM to AM and this makes it XM-style crystal clear. I even notice about two weeks of improved function after not having access to the medication. Then sadly it all comes back... Finding a doctor willing to prescribe to an adult is much more difficult than it used to be and my last doctor was very old and started having health problems. Since then I have moved and the 3 months that seems standard to wait to be seen (poor peoples' insurance) coupled with the ADD is an obstacle to treatment in and of itself. I have spent the last couple of hours researching potentially more accessible alternatives, but the truth is, for me, this is certainly the gold standard.
4$Condition: Other$7/17/2015 6:54:55 PM$Reviewer: Lavender rrr, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I started taking this about 4 months ago in combination with Wellbutrin XL and Ativan. My doctor prescribed it for my depression since SSRIs and SNRIs haven't really worked for me and the highest dose of Wellbutrin still didn't get me to a stable point. I really like it so far, I don't dread getting out of bed as much anymore and my overall mood has improved, My depression and even my anxiety a bit because I can finally focus enough to actually use coping skills. I was in college when I started taking it and my grades went from low 60s to mid 80s within a week, I stopped living miserably in my own filth because I finally have the energy to clean and get things done now instead of sleeping all day. I have had some side effects, it seems to make me a bit irritable at times, and sometimes aggravates my anxiety, not to the point that i've had to increase my Ativan dose though. It also doesn't seem to mix well with alcohol and makes me smoke more and eat less, but overall I'd say it's effective.

At first I didn't know if it worked or not until I realized I now learn in class when I didnt before. The side effects have brought me down though. I get diarrhea, nausea and vomit(I usually only vomit if I am in a situation I perceive as stressful, like tests). The diarrhea really gets to me sometimes, I miss class bc of it, but this is the only medicine that has helped my ADD and bc of that has also helped my depression. Not too fond of it but I guess it's better than the alternative
8$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/23/2014 5:28:35 AM$Reviewer: unconqueredmind, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I'm a 30-yr-old male diagnosed with severe - ADHD aged 29. Been on Dexedrine IR 15mg x 3 daily for 2 months and I find it a superb medication for controlling impulsivity. Very few side-effects and unlike Ritalin IR if I miss or am late taking my next dose I don't get that deflated, low feeling. It really is a smooth ride all the way. Probably the best ADHD-stimulant med for controlling restlessness and thus results in a significant improvement in my day to day organisation. My ability to concentrate on tasks is now within the spectrum of normal, in fact I'd say at the top end of normal.  My only criticism is that for me it's slightly less motivating than Ritalin so if your a daydreaming procrastinator maybe that might be a better choice. However I find Dexedrine improves my ability to multi-task whereas Ritalin decreases it because it forces me to lock-on to a task like a robot. All in all, both meds are highly effective, similar, and safe.

Started taking 5mg twice a day my junior year of college after being diagnosed ADD.  Upon first use I believed it was a wonder drug, I had tons of energy and I could actually concentrate.  Worked great for about 1/2 year, then started building up a dependence. Started on 10mg twice a day eventually.  If I missed a dose I would fall into a deep depression.  Destroyed my appetite, made me feel generally unhealthy after 6 months use.  I really don't think this drug should be prescribed at all.  There's a reason it's a schedule II narcotic.  It makes you feel *too* good.   I am convinced that this drug completely re-wired my brain, now whenever I have a stimulant such as caffeine, I go into hyper-euphoria mode for about an hour, then crash with huge amounts of fatigue and depression.   I would recommend any other add stimulant over this.  There is a reason this drug is hardly prescribed anymore.

That's right, the medication has a calming effect along with its ability to increase my attention and concentration. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has ADHD with a co-morbid anxiety disorder, because other medications like Adderall, or Ritalin exacerbated my anxiety. I take the medication as needed for symptoms and so far I have not noticed any tolerance build-up. It's a shame that since its a bit older, many doctors don't typically prescribe it, they opt for newer medications.

I was put on 10mg of Dexedrine and I was immediately better. I first noticed the medication was working when I was talking to my employer and for the first time I was able to look him in the eye. The sense of clarity was overwhelming. I've experienced very little side effects aside from weight loss (which I'm not complaining about!). All in all this drug is phenomenal.

I talk to people for a living and often find myself daydreaming in the middle of conversations and my procrastination factor has been totally cut in half.  I am tacking tasks that I usually ""save until tomorrow"" and that tomorrow never comes.  I think things are only going to get better when I start therapy.  It's too bad that adult ADHD has become so controversial.  I started to figure it out in my late 20's and before I had some sort of learning disability but was just higher functioning.  Why did it always take me double or triple the house to complete a paper in school when it took my best friend the ""normal"" amount of time?  Ha.  Feels good to not feel so crazy anymore and to have some confirmation.  Thank you to my provider for going out on a limb and giving it a chance when I was only asking for Wellbutrin! :-)"

I was given the diagnosis during 1994 at age 45. The 1st 3 yrs I took Ritalin 20mg x 3 tabs per day. Methylphenidate changed my life for the positive, but, the necessary timing, to take the tabs daily, became a hassle, and, switching to Dexedrine Spansule 15mg in the AM hours, and, having the Dexedrine Sulfate 5 mg instant release, for after 5 PM dosing, was the perfect combination. Unfortunately, GlaxoSmithKline removed the Dexedrine 5 mg tabs off of the USA market in 2009, thus, I now take Adderall 12.5 mg when the early AM dose of pure Dexedrine Spansule wears off. The Dexedrine I/R 5 mg I liked better, for 3 to 4 hrs of focusing ability, than, the current, Adderall or generic Adderall instant release. My deepest regret is not getting the ADHD diagnosis until age 45, because I had crystal clear symptoms since at least age 7, thus, I lost 38 yrs of my life, including blotched interpersonal relationships, job firings, job mismatches, 7 yrs to complete a 4 year Bachelors Degree, etc. Thus I am damaged merchandise, due to resentments. Individual Psychotherapy, Group Psychotherapy, one dozen books written by M.D's & Ph.D's have helped, along, with attendance to some national ADDA conventions. Drug trials with any other form of Ritalin/Methylphenidate, tri-cycle anti-depressants, Wellbutrin, SSRI's, SNRI's, have not measured up to brand name Dexedrine. I also prefer the brand name Dexedrine Sulfate, or Dexedrine Spansule, or Adderall instant release, due to the FDA's non regulation of the bioavailability (breakdown of the med in the body) with generic firms...as regulation of the bioequivalence, is not enought for me, just my 2 cents worth.  The price of the generics vs. the brand name ""borders highway robbery"", in my humble opinion.  "

I have been on this medication for over two years. Before I started to take it I was in bed by 8, slept till 9 a.m.; had a 3-4 nap one to two times a day.  I was unable to function which increased the severity of my other condtions.
The side effects have been severe in some areas - but the ability to stay awake, not having to nap my life away.  I am concerned about the long term affects on my mind and body, as both are taking a ""beating"".  I take over 700 pills a month - about 25 a day.  Plus I take an acute pain med and ativan 2 mg when I begin to have the tics.
I am very careful with this med as it has a lot of side effects; especially if I do not know if the effects are from the drug or the disorder.
I hope that my information has helped. I cannot stress enough how important it is to journal and/or track how you are doing so you can ensure your Doctor knows everything.

My doctor and I are still trying to find the best medication and dosage to treat me, but so far I have found the Dex to be the most effective.  I have found that the Dex evens out my thinking and my energy level and controls my hyperactive impulses so that I am in control of my own behavior.  Currently, I am taking 3 doses of Dex (7.5 mg each) per day, about 4-5 hours apart.  One of the reasons I like the Dex is that I have experienced very few side effects with this medication.  Due to a sensitive digestive system, for me, nausea is often a side effect of medications, but I have avoided this with the Dex by always taking it with food.  I also found that (for me) taking the medication with a caffeinated beverage causes intense headaches.  The only remaining effects I have found to be bothersome is that the medication begins to wear off after about 3 hours.  At that time, two things happen: First, I get very drowsy and second, the medication stops controlling my hyperactivity.  Unfortunately, these two effects do not cancel themselves out, but rather leave me sprawled sleepily in a chair while my fingers drum and my mind races!  For me, lower dosages have no effect and higher dosages make me so drowsy that any positive effects are negated.  Other ADHD medications I have tried (and rejected) include Strattera and Ritalin.

To be completely honest, I never write reviews like this, however, I know I wouldn't be the successful ivy league graduate I am today without dexedrine. I take a low dose- 5 mg twice a day - which has made an enormous difference.  Dexedrine makes me feel refreshed, focused, and efficient. I have never felt any side effects, besides occasional loss of appetite. I also easily discontinue use on weekends, with no withdrawal symptoms (I do not have an addictive personality though).  I have taken my sister's concerta before, and felt as though it was not comparable to dexedrine.  My only issue with dexedrine is the difficulty in obtaining prescriptions.  Doctors require psychological evaluations every 3 years and pharmacies require a new doctor's prescription every time you need to refill (and often ID you). Regardless, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks a hundred times over.

It lets me concentrate all day and get my work done without crashing like I do on the others.

Its took a little over a month for me to get used to it.  But the withdrawl is not pleasant, mostly depression issues were more evident.  Its the only one of all the drugs that has worked for me.
57$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/17/2007 9:18:44 PM$Reviewer: James, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was currently on a regime of Adderall 20mgs 3xday.  I switched to XR Dexedrine 15mgs 2xday.  The difference is night and day.  It seemed like Adderall had ups and downs on my ability to concentrate and stay on task.  While Dexedrine seemed a lot more level throughout that day with no dips in concentration and staying on task.

I believe this is a wonder drug that has enabled me to resume a normal life. When I take it every morning I don't really feel anything, but to go without it my mind wanders and can't remain focused. I only wished I had discovered this drug earlier in life. I had always thought it was normal for me to daydream and not being able to focus. Not anymore!
