0$Condition: Depression$4/28/2019 10:05:23 PM$Reviewer: Jo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Background: 
I’ve experienced depression on and off since I was 14. In university, I was a physics major, which was challenging and engaging, but could also be soul-crushingly hard. Even getting slightly behind would leave me completely overwhelmed struggling to catch up. Multiple times I fell into a hole of deep depression, binging/bulimia. 

Despite all this, I got hired to do my dream job the summer before senior year. When I got back to school however, I started slipping back into depression. Everything in my life was good, so I couldn’t understand why I was still depressed. At this point I had tried every non-medication treatment under the sun: therapy, meditation, journaling, etc. There are so many things they say you should do when you’re depressed (get out of the house, exercise, challenge negative thoughts, engage your mind in a task, etc.), but for me it was almost impossible to do these things when my brain was telling me I couldn’t even get out of bed. I decided to see a psychiatrist. 

Experience on medication: 
I I got lucky that Wellbutrin was the first thing my clinician prescribed me — bc I genuinely felt a difference within the first day. Tasks no longer seem insurmountable, and I can easily challenge my negative thoughts or lack of motivation. 

I take 150mg and have actually been able to overcome lifelong insomnia with the help of a very consistent bedtime routine (dim lights, shower, make tea, do a couple Duolingo lessons, put meds on my bedside table, and watch an ASMR video). My alcohol tolerance is somewhat lower than before, but it’s not bothersome. The most interesting side effect is that while in most situations it keeps my emotions quite even-keeled, when I am watching a show, concert, movie, or other art form, I can become moved to tears by it — in a good way! Maybe this sounds silly, but I actually feel like I get to more fully experience what it means to be human now. Anyway, I can’t recommend Wellbutrin highly enough."

With the help of Wellbutrin SR, I was cured of depression. In my opinion, it has much better efficiency than the usual Wellbutrin. A few days, and problems as not happened. If possible, better buy Wellbutrin SR http://wellmed24.com/buy-wellbutrin_sr-online

2$Condition: Depression$3/8/2017 8:52:21 AM$Reviewer: SheliaI, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on 100mg Wellbutrin SR for 3 days and I am absolutely amazed at the difference in how I feel.  I have energy and ambition to do things I haven't had interest in for years. So far no side effects. Before taking it, when I would get up in the morning, it would take me hours to get going.  Now I feel good when I get up. If I feel this good after only 3 days,  I can imagine how I'll feel after a month or so. I took Celexa for years and actually think it made me worse. Needless to say it flat lined my libedo.  Sure hope the wellbutrin helps with that.

I started taking SR on a friday, I was fine, Saturday - fine, Sunday - fine, on Monday I went to work, by lunch, all He** broke loose, the dreaded diarrhea. All day Monday was horrible, Tuesday, same thing, by Wednesday I could not take it anymore, so I started researching and found that Wellbutrin (Bedepprion)  interacts with caffeine. So Wednesday- no coffee,  no diarrhea, Thursday- no coffee, no diarrhea.  So I have only drank decaf coffee since, and have had no diarrhea.

Less sexual desire, less desire to eat. Usually have a small glass of wine 3 to 5 times a week; rarely now and I don't miss it...much. It has effected my sleep. Had to increase Ambien to 5mg (from 2.5)which I take every night. Its hard to make my brain shut down, even tho my bod is tired.

12$Condition: Depression$10/7/2013 8:36:53 PM$Reviewer: WedMD_girl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$2$"I took this drug for chronic depression, as prescribed by my psychologist and I experienced worsening depression. The warning label says that those under 25 may experience counter-active side effects, but I found that this drug made me feel much more depressed and I never had suicidal thoughts before then, but I did after taking the drug.

Because these feelings only worsened with time, I opted to get off of the drug and although I experienced some mild panic attacks for a while after, I eventually was able to overcome my depression while staying off the drug. Would not recommend for those under 25 at all! There have been some cases of people killing themselves after using this drug."

This medication works better than every anti-depressant I've ever been on (and trust me, I've been through the ringer).

17$Condition: Depression$4/16/2013 10:50:55 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$I've been on Bupropion SR 100 mg 2x a day for about 4 1/2 weeks and so far I'm not sure it's working for me. I took it a few years ago in conjunction with therapy and it worked wonders- motivated, happy,less stressed. I also don't really remember any side effects. Since I've started taking it again (for depression/ADD/SAD)I haven't been feeling too much of a difference, in fact I have felt more easily moved to tears, moodier, still stressed, and even less social. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not currently in therapy, if it's interacting with my birth control, or if I just need to wait a few more weeks. Also side effects- first few weeks I would get very anxious and my hands would shake very badly which affected my job (dog grooming)that has since subsided and isn't as much of an issue. Loss of appetite, which isn't horrible but it gives me a weird feeling in my stomach, not nausea, almost feels like hunger but eating doesn't help. This has also gotten a bit better as time goes by. I'm hoping that if I just wait it out it will sort itself out, I don't see how it could have worked so well for me before and not now... Will update in a few weeks

The first month of taking it was horrible, I had every side effect possible and I felt so ill that I almost stopped taking it. Gradually I started to feel better and after taking it for two months I was doing much better! Thanks to Wellbutrin I now have more energy, my depression is gone and my ADD is better now! 
20$Condition: Depression$12/27/2012 8:32:46 PM$Reviewer: gperez714, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking Wellbutrin SR (300 mg/day) for around 15 years now. It is unlike any of the dozens of other antidepressants I've taken over the years--it gives me energy and makes it easier to get up in the morning!  Please note that I only take the brand-name of this drug--I had severe reactions to the generic version (complete meltdown). I took the brand name for many years with no problem, but the generic felt like a completely different drug.  In reading these reviews, I wonder how many of the people with severe reactions were taking the generic version opposed to the brand name. According to my doctor, I have severe side effects to the buffering agents used in many medications. Just wanted to put that out there for consideration.
21$Condition: Depression$12/21/2012 7:30:54 AM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$2$I have had severe depression since I was a child. I have tried many anti-depressents, some worked but lost their effectiveness after years of taking them.  I have been on Wellbutrin SR for about a month.  I also take another anti-depressent with the Welbutrin.  Before taking Wellbutrin SR, I had no motivation and no interest in life.  This has changed dramatically and includes a lot more energy.  This is incredible.  The down side is I have been having increased insomnia and a funny feeling in my head when lying down and when looking up.  It does go away during the day.  This is unsettling and hope it subsides.  I am not giving this up for the reasons I have stated.  The Wellbutrin out ways the side effects.  Hope this helps.
22$Condition: Depression$12/10/2012 2:43:16 PM$Reviewer: marissa.m., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$I need to point out that I was on Effexor XR for almost 10 years and was so eager to get off it. During inpatient at a psych ward, the psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin SR. I've been on it less than a month and it's definitely working! I have so much more energy and motivation. It did increase my anxiety and I had quite a few of the side effects. I stuck through them and glad I did. I feel like such a weight is off my shoulders! My whole family/friends noticed a major difference in me. To all those complaining about side effects: every medication will have them. If you are truly eager to let a medication do it's job, you need to be taking it for AT LEAST 2 weeks to see the full effect. Don't be quick to give up on this medication. Suck it up, stick through it, and it will definitely pay off in the end. I am extremely happy with this medication so far. Switching from Effexor XR to Wellbutrin SR was the best choice I've ever made in my life!

26$Condition: Depression$10/11/2012 3:49:12 PM$Reviewer: TLo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been on Wellbutrin for over 2 weeks now - 300mg for depression in dealing with my divorce.  At first, I did experience slight headaches and a ""spaced out"" sort of feeling but it only lasted a few days. I've I fall asleep fast but do wake up around 3:00 am or so but after like 20 minutes I'm back asleep. I think if you limit caffeine intake (soda, coffee, etc.)you should be fine. Been having some vivid dreams but they're not a big deal, more interesting than anything else. Appetite has decreased -lost 5 lbs in just over 2 weeks)which is fine by me! Dry mouth, yes, but just drink more water. It's good for you anyway. Constipation? Yes, but just eat an apple or more veggies/fiber.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and feel healthier in general. Mood has lifted,able to focus more at work, energy level has increased, going to the gym more -outlook is much brighter.  Highly recommend this drug."

I have been taking generic and then brand name Wellbutrin for about 9 months and although it has not helped much with my mood I am continuing to take it.  It has helped with energy levels although I have difficulty sleeping and need to take a sleep aid every night in order to sleep through the night.  I also have dry mouth from it which was really awful at a higher dose (450mg) and did have funny feelings in my head when trying to go to sleep at that dose.  Adjusting to the Bupropion I did experience heart racing, et cetera.  Right now I am taking 200mg.  I continue to take it because I don't want to lose the effect of not struggling to stay awake all the time.  The Bupropion/Wellbutrin also helped me to lose 40 - 50 lbs over a period of 9 months

I do get jitters and rapid heart beat every now and then and some constipation, but overall I feel good. My depression is getting better, but I know what would also help is to stop worrying so much about stuff I cannot control.  I start therapy next week and I think that will really make me feel better also. Hope this helps someone.

I have had no side affects at all besides loss of appetite and weight loss (8 lbs so far!) which I view as a bonus.  It helps me sleep as I am prone to insomnia when I am depressed.  It's been almost a year and a half since I've had a full week where I wasn't up all night long at least 1 night and up to 3 nights a week until I started this med.  It has eliminated my anxious feelings.  I only wish I would have went to the Dr. and been put on this earlier.

I have no appetite what-so-ever (fine with me!), but feel anxious and jittery and have trouble falling asleep. I have much more energy, but feel nauseous and dizzy very often. I have not been on the drug long enough for the side-effects to subside, so I am toughing it out. From what I've read, the benefits most often outweigh the side-effects, and it's worth it to wait 4-6 weeks.
33$Condition: Depression$7/3/2012 11:50:00 PM$Reviewer: parsonsjo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$In a two week period I went from trying to control my depression to a worsening depression/psychiatric conditions, unusual behavior changes, thoughts and other mental/mood changes (including new/worsening anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, irritability, hostile/angry feelings, impulsive actions, severe restlessness, very rapid speech). I didn't care about anything or anyone. I was very hostile, angry, and snapped and anything. I reached a point where I wanted to put my fist thru someones face and I was waiting for someone to piss me off. This drug made my PTSD overwhelming and I was seeing things and the images of the warzone was always popping up. I was seeing the flesh rotting of peoples faces. Worms, maggots, snakes crawling out of thiers eyes, nose, ears & mouth as I was talking and looking/ talking right them. My night terror dreams left me screaming until I would wake my hearing impaired wife up. I lost over 25 lbs and nearly lost my mind with this medication. My wife, son and daughter were in constant fear of setting me off. I wouldn't recommend to medication to anyone. It was like my brain was on fire and my thoughts were racing a 1,000 mph. I so badly want to crash my truck in a brick wall at 120 mph to put a end to this madness. I have been taking meds for over 9+ years to treat my depression, socail phoia, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping. I feel that after a little two weeks of taking this pill at 150mg twice aday that my menatl state is even worse then ever before. This medication has triggered some veterns with PTSD to kill and kill themself. If you have PTSD or know someone who does please stay away form it.

38$Condition: Depression$1/24/2012 9:43:58 AM$Reviewer: COF momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking the generic form of this med in August 2010.  Originally, it was given to me to help with anxiety and overall being overtaxed with the cares of life.  It took about 2 weeks to really start feeling a change.  I typically have seasonal affective disorder; so, this medicine was extremely helpful during the fall and winter months.  I stopped noticing much of an impact in the spring; so, I gradually took myself off of it and did fine through the summer.  I went back on it in September 2011 when I felt the symptoms of depression and anxiety start to creep back up on me.  In the winter, I could gain 20 pounds EASILY but since I started taking this medicine, I have lost 30 pounds and actually feel motivated to take better care of myself (which is required to take the best care of my family).  Overall, this medicine has been very effective for me.  The only drawbacks I can see are that, after a while, I stopped seeing any effects of it (during the warmer months).  I also had extreme bouts of sweating and some insomnia.  I have some occasional dizziness as well.  But as infrequently as I have any of these side effects, this medicine is still very much worth my time and money.
39$Condition: Depression$1/7/2012 2:53:57 PM$Reviewer: sunshinesmiles, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$4$I personally have been taking this medication for almost 4wks. The beginning was fine, and just the waiting game for it to kick in. At about 3wks I started feeling more than just the dry mouth, the headaches were horrible a few hours into the med, been having to take laxatives for the constipation, which at 21 is a horrid reality. The kicker for me is the nausea the constant cruddy stomach feeling, I dont eat because I am not hungry, but then the pain worsens as it generally does when you dont eat. If I try eating, I feel sicker to my stomach afterward. The dr just upped my med from 100mg 2x day (am,pm) to 150mg 2x day, I am praying (and I am not religious) that this gets better. I'll update later on if symptoms clear up. best of luck everyone.

Big mistake! After about a month off it I felt the major depression coming back. The most prominent side effects I have noticed are terrible shakes and a ""spacey head"" feeling.

I was very nervous to start taking it after reading all of the horror stories about side effects. However I had no bad side effects other than some constipation and it made me tired. I was on Lexapro for a little over a year before this and while it did help, it made me very zombie like and emotionless. And after awhile it didn't seem like it was helping anymore. (weaning off Lexapro is not fun either!) I know it's too early to tell if the medicine is working or not but I notice that I am happier. Most things I used to cry about don't upset me anymore. I can actually deal with a stressful situation instead of giving in to my emotions. I am supposed to up the dose to 150 mg twice a day in a few weeks so things may change but so far so good!

I take 150 mg twice a day. I can honestly say that so far it has improved my daily attitude and certainly is helping me deal with my depression.  I also have experienced some weight loss, and some constipation.  At first this medication gave me cotton mouth as well, but I am into week 3 and that seems to have deteriorated.  
Even some of my longtime co-workers notice a difference in my attitude.  Also I think I myself am trying to change the way I think and this medication only helps me to do that.  I sleep better than  I did before taking this, and the dreams like other people have said are very vivid.  They aren't nightmares but they are easy to recall.  Hope this helps for some of you with worries about taking this.  May not be for everyone, but so far it has worked well for me."

I suffered a severe neck injury( 3 surgeries) that rendered me disabled way before my time. Became depressed after I had to resign my job and give up golf and other activities that I loved. I tried several other meds but between the constant pain of my injury and the depression I could barely get out of bed. My Dr. put me on wellbutrin sr 100 mg twice daily at first and it helped for awhile before I fell back into a rut. Then he suggested 100 mg prestiq ALONG with the wellbutrin and everything just clicked. I know that this may be an strange combo but I also know that it has worked wonders for me ! I have proof every morning as my first hour of the day is still brutal until the medication takes hold. I now have the energy and resilience to face each day in a positive manor. A little wordy here but if I can help just one person it's worth the extra typing. I now have a renewed and much needed energy level and feel light years better than I had before.

It worked excellent for me. However, last week (7 days ago exactly) I switched to Wellbutrin SR, 100mg in am and 100mg in pm, secondary to significant sexual difficulties experienced with Zoloft. I started Wellbutrin SR to also treat ADHD, hoping that it was a ""bang for my buck"" type med. As of this past week I have been experiencing side effects of agitation, shakiness, dizziness, and emotional. At the same time I have been significantly functional completing my daily tasks and then some. I have been able to go to BJ's and not feel overwhelmed and actually focus on my grocery list!!! One of the major issues I am experiencing is a very odd ""electrical shock"" type feeling upon movement. I have experienced this before if I missed several doses of the Zoloft, so I am wondering since I have recently switched, is this the side effect of not having Zoloft in my system or the Wellbutrin SR?

Now on wellbutrin and only started 3 days ago. I noticed jitters and just a overall sicky feeling in my head. i take (100mg 2x) 1 in am than 1 in pm. i lost 3 lbs already. which i havent had constipation like most patients. i notice energy after my head feels better later in day after am pill. but i normally have to take a nap in mid afternoon to help with the jitters and sick feeling. I have slept better not sleeping all 12 hrs of day away like in last yr. I get up and start the day with energy for house chores but only have the energy till i take the am pill than I seem to loose the energy and the jitters and shakes come. i hope the best on this and pray the side effect goes away like today but i understand takes time. I do believe with losing 3lbs already and energy increase this will work out. Also I have to say Im a bit more short temper with wellbutrin right now too. Feel that should go away too. Im to stay on 2x 100mg until further doc. tappt. in next 4wks. I will update after my appt. I hope to help others believe me I have switched it up 3 time in one yr. before going on effexor. now im on another path to try and turn around bad side effects of weight gaining from effexor.

However, Wellbutrin made me constipated and dizzy, gave me extreme dry mouth and headaches, and made me feel feverish and exhausted for about two hours a day, every day. Worst of all, it made me incredibly anxious and nervous. It may have actually made me feel worse. After a month, I went back to my Dr and I've been off of it for a week and a half. Now I'm vomiting and I'm even more constipated than I was before.
I'm really glad this drug helps some people, but for me it has been nothing but an absolute nightmare."

I had few side effects in the beginning but they subsided. Recently I feel very very tired within about 45 minutes of taking it. I have looked for side effects of this nature but haven't found any. All in all I think it works great. All my life medications have had the opposite affect on me. For example, Nyquil wakes me rather than helping me sleep. I think for those who may have this same problem may have the same affects of tiredness like I have had with it.

I was on tricyclics for a while in my late 20s (horrible side effects), and then the SSRIs (first Lexapro, then Celexa). The Lexapro had NO effect on me. The 20-mg Celexa made me sleep 12-14 hours a day (seriously), gained 7 pound in 1 week (ug), lost my motivation, lost what was left of my sex drive, and made me feel quite drugged. I insisted that my doc let me try Welbutrin. He put me on 75 mg generic Welbutrin SR. I feel fantastic! My energy is back, I am starting to get bursts of happiness, I smile more, my sex drive is creeping back, and I lost a couple pounds without trying.
I am SO happy that this drug is around because talk therapy and exercise was not enough for me. Depression is a genetic disorder that causes chemical imbalances in the brain. So you have to keep trying different meds - in my case, it was an imbalance in norepinephrine and dopamine, which is was Welbutrin treats."

This drug has turned my life around and is working better then I ever thought it would. Before taking the drug I was always tired, lazy, and just really not myself. I know the reasons why I felt like this I had a few pretty horrible personal issues and I just kept dwelling on them. Believe it or not this drug has given me my life back. I will tell you right now your sleeping pattern will change 100%. You will not sleep as well as you normally would but you also don't feel tired because you didn't sleep that well. For example I could sleep 8 hours before the drug now I only sleep 6 but have the energy like I slept 10 and the mood that all is well. THIS IS KEY!!! I HIGHLY SUGGEST you talk to your doctor and have him prescribe you e Klonopin or Xanex. I shouldn't say that but for my situation this drug can cause anxiety because it is a stimulant and every now and then you may need a benzo to calm down. Highly reccomend the combination of Wellbutrin and a benzo if your life is in the dumps at the moment

I was originally taking 300 mg when I first started using it about five years ago.  I really liked the way it helped with my depression.  However, I did notice an increase in anxiety with it, and the headaches were awful.  I took it for about four years and during that time felt better but sleep problems, headaches and anxiety were issues.  I cut my dosage down to 100 mg daily last year and added Zoloft 100 mg daily.  Headaches did not improve and overall feeling of well being decreased.  I am now off Wellbutrin and just on Zoloft 100 mg daily. Since I stopped taking Wellbutrin I've gained 20 pounds (I had lost 50 pounds over the four year period I took it, which I loved!).  Anyway, I'm debating taking the Wellbutrin again because I feel less depressed on it, and have more energy but I hate the thought of going back to severe headaches and more trouble sleeping (even though I have headaches and trouble sleeping all the time due to Fibromyalgia).  I do take clorazepate to help sleep and that has worked nicely without the hangover feeling of other sleep meds.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to deal with the headaches if I start taking the Wellbutrin again???  Thanks!

That was rough: the first few days of just Wellbutrin, I was an insomniac. It got better with time, but when Lexapro got added to my ""treatment"", I became such a zombie that I failed my classes that term. I was headachey, couldn't move, didn't want to...it was worse than my depression.

Now my doc convinced me to retry Wellbutrin, so I've been taking 75mg for the past couple of weeks. It's not bad. The first couple of days it felt like I was on speed or something because I was really hyper and jittery, but it's calmed down. The only thing I really notice is that I don't fall asleep until about 2 in the morning, and I sleep through my alarm clock (9am). I also had headaches for a couple days as well, but I can't blame that or anything else solely on Wellbutrin, as I'm taking BC along with it, and it's allergy season and I get really headachey during that. 

I'm a bit disappointed in the reviews I've found here though: some of you aren't giving your body enough time to get used to it before you start ranting about how you're going to get off it. Obviously if it's put you in the hospital already then yeah, you should find something else, but for the rest of you complaining about not being able to sleep/think/whatever since you started three days ago...BE PATIENT!"

GREAT results. No side effects for me, and still effective nearly 4 years after taking it. Take with an anxiety-related medication and does not conflict. I recommend this to those who want to try something other than Prozac, and some of the other anti-depressent medications out there that do have side effects.

The second day is when the side effects started. I couldn't sleep, anger (totally out of character for me), anxiety, fatigue, dizzy, slight headache. The anxiety was so bad I just ran away. I felt like I just needed to leave my house. I dunno why. I'm still on it today. I've been on it for about a month and a half and im still really dizzy. I keep spacing out writing this.

I had done Paxil which deaden the sex driven and made me gain weight.  St. John wort wasn't strong enough (I think my depression is somewhere above moderate.)

But if this didn't work for you, please try another - there is something out there that will work for you.

The negative side effects I have noticed are constipation, strange taste in my mouth, and slight shaking in my hands. I am so happy with this drug it's unbelievable. I have completely eliminated caffeine in my diet as well as naps during the day b/c of the added energy. I never expected to be so happy with the results.

I only took it for 5 days, and during that time, my anxiety was through the roof.  I was so anxious I almost ended up in the E.R., so I had to stop taking it.  I had a pretty good headache for about 3 days after stopping this med., but getting rid of it was well worth the pain.  I don't recommend Wellbutrin for any type of anxiety disorder.  Why my doc gave me a med that would increase my anxiety I'll never know.  My experience was quite scary!

I experienced loss of libido with Lexapro so I talked to my Dr. about changing meds.  While I don't know how it has made a difference in my libido, I have found that I have more energy, more focused, happier.  I even laugh at myself now.  I didn't expect this medicine to work so quickly, but it is almost amazing.  The first 3 days I took it only once in the morning and then on the 4th day in the morning and evenings.  As far as side affects, the first 2 days felt some initial stomach discomfort, but this has passed.  Also when I increased my dose as instructed to twice a day, I noticed that at bedtime I was very awake, but not to the point where I couldn't fall asleep.  Also, the first two days of increased dosage I had disturbing dreams, but those two have stopped.  Also, I found it has curved my need to smoke meaning I smoke a lot less often.  Overall, I am pleased with this medicine and hopes it continues to work this well for me.

I couldn't control my blood pressure with Wellbutrin XR.  Welbutrin SR seems to be one of a kind.  I do get surges of panic, but at least I can function on a day to day basis.

117$Condition: Depression$6/13/2009 1:52:37 PM$Reviewer: wildflower, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$I have suffered from depression since 1994 and had been on a variety of SSRI's and TCA's before being tried on Wellbutrin SR 10 years ago. I found the SSRI's and TCA's all had similar side effects with me, some lightening of the depression but I always seemed to have a crash when I was under stress that resulted in hospital admission for worsening depression and either suicidal thinking or an attempt. Initially my dose was titrated up to 300mg per day but I found I became very agitated and anxious at this dose and my doctor and I slowly decreased the dose to 150mg a day about 9 years ago which is the dose I have maintained. I found that I didn't have any crashes on Wellbutrin SR and I didn't feel depressed anymore. However I am a smoker and I never felt the urge to quit smoking or any reduction in my craving for cigarettes. This feeling of well-being continued until March of this year when a fill-in doctor prescribed 150mg a day of Wellbutrin XL instead of Wellbutrin SR.  Gradually over the last 3 months I have become more depressed and occasionally have suicidal thoughts. This surprised me when I started feeling this way again as there seemed to be no reason for it until I remembered that the doctor had changed my antidepressant from Wellbutrin SR to Wellbutrin XL. The drug manufacturer indicates that doses of the two drugs are equivalent and switching between them at the same dose should not result in any problems. However, in my case, I feel the dose of Wellbutrin XL would have to be increased to give me the same feeling of well-being that 150mg of Wellbutrin SR gave me. I will be switching back to Wellbutrin SR next week and expect that my feelings of depression will be history. As everyone responds to medication differently, there is no reason to believe that anyone else will experience the same effects that I did. However, it is something to consider if you are switched and find the same dose of Wellbutring XL to be not as effective as the Wellbutrin SR.
118$Condition: Depression$6/8/2009 6:45:15 PM$Reviewer: sdmlink718, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have suffered from depression and increasing anxiety for a very long time.  This is my first attempt with medication and I have had great results.  I have been on it for almost three months and I no longer cry everyday!  I am able to deal with my stress and I am able to confront issues that I am upset about instead of running away.  At first I had more panic attacks and had trouble with dizziness but that wore off after three weeks. Be careful driving for the first few weeks-I had problems with the dizziness and focusing about an hour after taking the pill. I also still have problems with my memory-forgetting important numbers and names.  I have noticed that I tend to feel anger and irritability if something is annoying me more so than without the drug.  I have lost 11 lbs so far and hope to continue with the weightloss.  I have had problems with insomnia but rememdy it with 1 Tylenol PM which helps tremendously. I quit smoking two years ago but now more than ever I can't stand the smell of cigarettes-hope I can get more accustomed to that soon.  This drug has improved my life so much-I am a completely new person and I am thankful that I decided to give it a try.
119$Condition: Depression$6/7/2009 1:13:08 AM$Reviewer: grparadox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been taking this drug for depression for 4 weeks now.  Initially, I had uncontrolled crying spells, increased energy, and loss of appetite.  Now that it has stablized, I have energy, have lost 20 bls, decreased from 2 packs to 1 pack of smokes a day, have a pretty good feeling of well being, no crying spells, my emotions are in normal range, and I am getting my libido back gradually.  I am currently taking 300 mg daily (150 mg x2).  I was taking Zoloft with Lithium before.  Now I take Lamictal for my bi-polar.  A previous review mentioned that no drug is a cure all for depression. I believe that we can manage our depression with medication and therapy.  We just have to find the right one that works for us.  Never give up hope. Never. What works for some, doesn't necessarily work for all.  That is why these forums are here, to help people.  Wellbutrin Sr, had some side effects intiially, but like the literature stated that came with my bottle, the doctor thought the effects of the drug out weighed the side effects.  I have tried several medications in the past 8 years.  At least for me, I was told to give a medication 4-6 weeks to see if it is going to work, unless you are having sever side effects.  Obvious side effects aside.  Wellbutrin is not the cure all for everyone, but it seems to be working for me pretty well.  I have my life back. I can get out of bed in the morning. I want to walk my dogs, exercise, go shopping, eat, and just plain live.  Before I did not, and attempted not to.  So best wishes to all.

I started with Zoloft after the birth of my first child, and then switched to Prozac and back to Zoloft. It worked well for me until recently. I started having anxiety attacks( which I had never had before) and I became very irritable. The doctor changed me to Wellbutrin SR, and I've been taking it for about a week. The first two days it was like I was on speed or something. I had more energy than I've had in years. I cleaned (really cleaned) my house for two days straight. Third nothing unusual, fourth day very sick (possible reaction from other medications). Today, I feel kinda foggy, jittery, and dizzy. Not sure if it is the medication or the medication with coffee. I had two cups which normally wouldn't bother me, but wondering if I shouldn't drink with this rx. So far, side effects aren't anything I can't handle.

It is a good medicine has helped a lot, just has some side effects. I am taking Budeprion SR 150mg 2x daily.

123$Condition: Depression$5/19/2009 11:35:55 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I was on wellbutrin for 3-4 years for depression and it worked great.  The first several weeks were hell- I was already severely depressed, and once I started the wellbutrin I couldn't eat or sleep.  So if you're about to start taking it, try to have someone in your life watching out for you, because the first few weeks can be really unpleasant.  After that it controlled my depression perfectly, and as a bonus I lost some weight.  I'm not taking it now because after several years it started to affect my cognitive abilities (couldn't think of words, etc.), and I'm on celexa instead, but wellbutrin worked so well that I might even risk the cognitive effects to go back on it.  The longest-lasting effect was not being able to stand the smell of cigarette smoke- it's been over a year since I stopped taking it, and I'm just now becoming ok with walking past people smoking on the street.

If you already have anxiety, Wellbutrin alone will make it worse. I took Wellbutrin for 3 years, and then started experiencing severe anxiety, heart palpitations, jitterness, etc. I went off Wellbutrin and started taking Prozac. The Prozac works, but of course then you have the weight gain and the decreased libido. I read here on WebMD that you can take Wellbutrin along with SSRI's, and it will actually increase your libido and will help control your appetite. I tried the two together, and it works! My sex drive came back within two days (yes, two days!), and my appetite has significantly decreased. I think the combination of the two (Wellbutrin and Prozac) brought me to exactly where I need to be!

136$Condition: Depression$1/31/2009 9:52:36 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I have been taking generic Wellbutrin SR 300mg for just alittle over a month. I had heard only good things about it and how much everyone liked it, so I thought I'd give it a try. The first week when I was taking 150mg I had so much energy and really felt good, plus it decreased my appitite. Then I went up to 300mg and my energy level tapered off which wasn't bad, my appitite came back which wasn't good, and I was more depressed, moody, agitated..just all around a bitch. It was like I had PMS everyday and I would be mad and not really know why. So, I am now in the process of weaning myself off it taking 150mg a day instead of 300mg. I haven't really had any withdrawal problems. I guess because I haven't been on it that long. I go back to my doctor on Monday and will have her put me back on Effexor which is what I was taking before and I love it. The only reason I quit taking it was because my health insurance changed and I could no longer afford it, but I found out it comes in generic now and is alot cheaper. If anyone else has had the same problems that I have experenced on Wellbutrin please let me know, because everyone else  I know that is on it thinks it is so great and don't understand why it isn't for me.

138$Condition: Depression$1/25/2009 1:24:35 PM$Reviewer: micrograd, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I read all of the posts and found some that I could definately identify with.  I've been on Wellbutrin SR for almost 2 months.  I transitioned to this from Zoloft (taken on and off for 3-4 years).  I switched because Zoloft drastically increased my appetite and I began gaining weight.  I have had some improvements on Wellbutrin including: weight loss, increased energy, getting out of bed much easier, return of sex-drive, and more motivation.  I did have insomnia when I started the Wellbrutrin.  That has gone and I actually think I'm sleeping better than I have in years.  I have also experienced some minor upset stomach from time to time, slightly shaky hands, and weird/stressful dreams.  The only concerns I have are that I am starting to feel a little paranoid and I tear up extremely easily.  I haven't started any uncontrollable crying but I'm afraid I might.  I am having monthly check-ups with my doctor so I can voice my concerns.  I also think it is very beneficial to seek out the help of a psychologist/psychiatrist.  Overall I am pleased with the progress.  I'm very close to finishing up a PhD and this has greatly improved my productivity and motivation.

I take lexapro in the morning and wellbutrin at night time. It takes about three or four weeks to get used to the wellburtin. You will have all the side affects mentioned, but once it gets into your system it works great. All the side of effects seem to go away. I still have muscle aches every now and then. I had problems sleeping two, so my doctor put me on trazdone. It is wonderful, but you have to get a full eight hours sleep when using this drug. All the meds combined seem to be working for me. I did notice that I do have weird dreams sometimes, but overall I would change the meds. I would rather put up with my dreams then to be taking off my meds. I hope my review helps answer someone's questions.

For a while, I wasn't sure if it was helping or not, but while I've been on it, I've had fewer panic attacks and have been able to deal with stressful situations in a much more collected manner.  It has also helped with my depression symptoms (I sleep better and am less distracted).  As a full-time college student, it was important to me that I only take long-term medications with minimal warnings about missing a dose once in a while, and I've never had any problems when this happens.

Overall, I have had a positive experience with Wellbutrin and have noticed no negative side effects."

My depression has improved immensely-I have no trouble getting out of bed and being motivated for the day.  Also a bonus is the return of sexual sensitivity and libido.  I had taken Paxil at one time and it totally eliminated sexual feelings.  Have also noticed it helps considerably with weight loss.  On Paxil I gained a lot of weight.  I am on 300 mg. a day and intend to stay on it-please give it a chance if you are having side effects-they are temporary!!
151$Condition: Depression$8/16/2008 5:23:32 PM$Reviewer: applefarmer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$Nothing else I have tried has helped my depression like this - not Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, or Lexapro. And this does not have any side effects that I cannot tolerate. When you first start taking this, if it causes insomnia, shakiness, hand tremors, or nervousness - ask your Dr. to temporarily give you something to help you with these side effects so you can stick it out and stay on it for 6 weeks to see if it helps you. If my Dr. had not given me Ambien for the insomnia and Propranolol for the hand tremors, I would not have stuck with this long enough to tell that it works much better for me than anything else I have tried. Also, it is the only antidepressant that give me the side effect of decreased sexual sensation. Also, it actually greatly increases my libido! The only problem is that it made me constipated and every few yrs I need my dose increased and then the constipation comes back. So if you have this side effect, eat more fiber and drink lots of water and if that is not enough ask your doctor if you can take a stool softener the first month or so you are on Wellbutrin. Your body should adjust after you have been on this for 3-6 weeks and then you should be able to taper off the stool softeners and be fine. PLEASE insist that your doctor tell you how to counter any side effects and try this for 6 wks before you decide whether it is for you. I know 4 people who have been greatly helped by Wellbutrin when no other antidepressants worked or when the other antidepressants had bad side effects.

Originally I was perscribed a twice daily routine but once daily was actually more effective for me. As far as side effects at first it actually decreased my appetite tremendously but that wore off over time. The biggest thing to remember with this drug, or any antidepressant, it takes at least 4 weeks for the effects to really be seen. Also if the depression is being caused by a specific situation the drug is not going to fix or cure that situation. I have clinical depression and this drug has helped balance my body so that I can have a healthy or ""normal"" range of emotions. I still get mad, sad, and depressed at times because of different situations in my life but because of the med I can cope with them. Overall, the drug is extremely effective but please keep in mind no antidepressant is a ""happy"" pill that will all of the sudden make you want to go skippy through the fields. If you have a natural chemical imbalance it is extremely effective at helping create a healthy balance with minimal side effects."

Wellbutin is good for weight loss or  quitting a habit like smoking but' that's it. It's an old school pill and Effexor or Lexapro should be given a test. It has helped me to change to new life when the more modern Doctors came in and put me on the new up to date drugs And, I've been though all depressions and mood swings has to offer in my disfunctional life of stresses.

I also take seroquel (25 mg) which takes some of the edge off the wellbutrin but not enough. I would have fits of rage in which I punched the wall until the skin split on my knuckles. I became a overtalkative nuisance to other people. I began to think they were plotting against me. I suffered from constipation, muscle twitches, seizure symptoms, respiratory problems, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety (there were many occasions where I was afraid to leave the house), and teeth grinding. It got to the point where I had to skip a dose every other day for me to calm down somewhat. My Psychiatrist recently instructed me to ween off the drug and start taking Lexapro.
