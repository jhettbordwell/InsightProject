I was on this medication for only 1month and I was doing things that was not the normality to me. I gained so much weight, I was always dropping something on the floor, taking a nap was a MUST because I could not keep my eyes open during the day, I walked and felt like I was going to pass out if I didn't take a break, I bit off a nice chunk of the side of my tounge (that was VERY PAINFUL)! I wet the bed twice, and very forgetful (tried drinking ammonia and couldn't remember,my brother caught me in action .) I will never take this medication again!!!

I went off once for 5 years and then had to start back on them.  It works great for my depression and anxiety.  My depression and anxiety are pretty much nonexistent now!!  I hate the eating restrictions but I would rather be free of depression than eat cheese etc.  My major dissatisfaction with taking it is the bloating and weight gain!!  I never had a weight problem until starting taking it - it evidently slows my metabolism down.  I do kinda move slower and I think that my age and taking Nardil contribute to it  I can't say enough good things about Nardil.  It saved my life!!  I tried many SSRIs and the side effects were terrible with all of them.  Ironically, the side effects were anxiety and depression!!  The last thing I needed was more depression and anxiety!  I thank God everyday for the Nardil.

Been on it 13 years and still works very well for depression and anxiety.  No other medication worked.  I don't find it hard being on this drug, the diet required is hardly noticeable. When I have gone off it I fall into a depressed heap and can barely function.  This medication has been so good to me.

No others prescribed beforehand, which is regretted by me. Over an 8 year period tried ceasing PS 3times in hospital for meds changes. All fails &shock therapy required& return to PS. Last stay 6mths. Massive weight gain for 5'1"" female. Although following instructions, depression unresolved; dose 45mg with anxiety still unresolved at workplace or home; unable to organise or plan properly, bad concentration, panic. Depression and suicide ideation continues with failure &for fear of not coping with anxiety through lack of concentration under pressure(work/social). After decrease over 12 months to 22.5mg(1.5tabs) went back to 30mg. Weight now gaining excess.
Recently learned of recommended initial & maintenance PS dose regimes, the practice of prescribing B6 for patients, &that other drugs can be added - care I've not been offered or experienced. Feeling ripped off by 5psych's not understanding PS& possibly causing me unnecessary struggle.
Now looking forward to dealing with PS expert to discuss info, and seek assessment/treatment for ADHD which could well be the underlying cause of my condition all along.
God Bless you on your journey. Keep seeking answers to your questions from professionals. Seems there's a lot of MD ignorance about this potentially very useful drug."

I started going through a low grade depression about a year ago due to life circumstances and my doctor tried to cut back on my Nardil to add another MAOI as I had tried that in the past and felt great. Unfortunately in trying to get off Nardil I went into a very hostile  manic phase that I couldn't (nor could anyone around me) tolerate and had to go back solely on Nardil.

I do want to note two things for other users - if you need a little more than just Nardil both Cytomel (a thyroid drug) and lithium in very small doses will boost the Nardil. Also THERE IS AN ANTIDOTE TO A FOOD OR DRUG REACTION TO NARDIL - YOU TAKE ONE PROCARDIA (aka NIFEDIPINE), BITE INTO IT AND PUT IT UNDER YOUR TONGUE AND YOU SHOULD BE OUT OF THE REACTION WITHIN 10 MINUTES. THIS WORKS! - I know from personal experience.  I had a psychiatrist I was seeing who read about it and give it to all his patients on MAOIs."

No one could help me until one psychiatrist treated with Nardil. within 60 days I was lifted to normal and here 20 years later, perfect. 
now at 66 yrs old, my medical doctors are reluctant to do surgery, etc because of the conflicts in meds. I called pfister for a list of safe medications for surgery, pain, etc. and they have no such info. So, any medical pros out there that can help me out here.

When I was first prescribed it, it was for treatment-refractory depression. My anxiety attacks and ""zombie-like"" mood were horrible. Six weeks later, I felt like a new person. Over time, my dose had to be raised from 90 mg/day to 105, and when I became severely depressed, I had to go up to 135/day; it was the only way for the Nardil to kick in again. Ultimately, I went back to 90 mg/day, but after 32 years, I feel it is not working. My doctor had wanted me to add Abilify, but the potential side effects are frightening. Frankly, I know more than my doctor now about MAOIs, so there is no one new to turn to. Definitely, in 2003, when Pfizer changed the coating, the drug stopped working as well as it had. I have reported this to Pfizer as many patients have, but they continue to manufacture this sub-stand version of the drug. Taking Nardil has become a lifestyle for me. I eat and take other meds according to the rules. BTW, I had major surgery this year and did not have to discontinue Nardil. Just make sure you speak with a darn good anesthesiologist and your fears will be gone. Good luck to all of you. I need the old drug back. It saved my life at one time!"
23$Condition: Depression$4/17/2013 10:52:39 AM$Reviewer: Cattleya, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) $5$5$5$"Possible Interaction of MULTAQ with NARDIL
My wife has used Nardil with success for 30 years ; her present dose is 15 mg QID (60/d.)I am writing this to alert other Nardil users to an unexpected interaction with Multaq (dronedarone, Sanofi.) My wife experienced profound bradycardia (HR < 50 bpm), weakness and dyspnea after 5 doses (two days) on drug. After DX, she recovered over a 2 day period to normal heart rate. The US FDA package insert is silent on MAOI's. International package inserts from the rest of the world contain a disclosure that MAOI's impede clearance by amine-oxidases of the active metabolite of Multaq, resulting in effective overdosage. We would not have started Multaq had we been aware of this issue. I have alerted both Sanofi and the US FDA of the need to harmonize with other agencies on this issue.
As many Nardil users know, critical care physicians are too often unaware of serious Nardil interactions. I would recommend as a resource the free-text article by PK Gillman in British Journal Anaesthesia 95: 434 (2005)which deals with fatal risk to serotonin toxicity (""storms"") following unwitting coadministration of many popular anaesthetics and pain-killers."

Been on and off lots of different drugs and had huge success with Nardil, until the side effects kicked in. I haven't felt this good emotionally for years, but unfortunately I have to go off of it because I'm miserable physically.  I have horrible tremors, my whole body shakes till I'm in so much pain I have to take pain meds, I've had uncontrolable diarrhea since I started it 4 months ago. I get so dehydrated I have to go to the ER for fluids regularly, I also have insomnia and terrible blood pressure issues. My blood pressure hasn't been above 90 over 60 since I started and it has gotten as low as 55 over 30 which obviously means a trip to the hospital. I'm so glad for those of you who don't have these problems. I wish I didn't because Nardil gave me my life back. If you are thinking about trying it I would say go for it. If I didn't have so many problems on it I would stay on it forever.

I will probably try to wean myself off it VERY slowly, since I can't find a doctor who knows anything about it, but I'm sure it will take months or years. DO NOT START NARDIL unless there is no other option!!!!

I went back on Nardil and have been fine. For those of you out there afraid of a possible surgery, I have had an appendectomy, removal of a uterine cyst under general anesthesia, colonoscopies etc. and have had 
absolutely no issues. If you are depressed and anxious and nothing is working, do not be afraid of side effects. They are bothersome at first and then mostly disappear. This medication can ice you peace and sanity."

At one time I consulted a psychiatrist about a replacement.  Ultimately he said that since it worked so well I should stay on it, and that he had put several other patients on it.

Almost everything else was tried.  It worked extremely well in the first few years.  However, my depression continued to get worse after a couple years.  Was put on Xanax and Remeron.  I know Nardil and Remeron shouldn't be used together, but it worked.  Then I went on Seroquel also.  The 4 worked well together.  However, the weight gain was awful.  Then, my blood sugar was very high. Found out, Seroquel can cause diabetes.  Went slowly off of that.  Then tired Abilify.  After 2 weeks on it, I totally lost 2 days of my life, no memory and totalled a car.  Got totally checked for a stroke.  No stroke.  What was the cause?  Probably Abilify.  Be careful, it's a scarey drug.  Now I am in big trouble.  Only 2 drugs I haven't tried.  One 25% of the time causes hair loss and the other can have a deadly rash.  I already have 0 Stage Melanoma.

During the interim, Pfizer reformulated the generic and there has been much controversy over that because the old formula is said to have been better, and it was - though like this one it seems to become less effective over time. In any event, at 45 mg. a day it decreases my depression and significantly decreases my anxiety.  The main problems are fatigue, feeling oversedated, and being mentally foggy (this latter side effect was not true of the 90's formula). I also suffer with insomnia.  All in all, I would say it's good enough to temporarily get yourself out of a deep funk and to numb you if you're panicked, but I don't see my self functioning well and staying on it over the long haul.

Tell your anestheologist that you take Nardil and everything will be fine. I do wear a medic alert ""charm"" on a chain around my neck 24/7. You do NOT want anyone to administer DEMEROL to you.

At age 45, I had a full blown panic attack after having suffered stoically most of my life, trying to fix ""my problem"". I also had ""High Achiever"" tendancies.  The root cause of my suffering was social anxiety and it's partner, depression. After trying several SSRIs with no success, my Psychiatrist suggested ""The Big Gun""......""Nardil"". The combination of Nardil and Ativan worked like a miracle for me. Nardil was used successfully in Europe for many years before it was introduced into the US.

It's sort of numbing and makes me calm.  I've also taken parnate which is more stimulating.  The problem w/both is the side effect of insomnia (which is worse w/parnate).  True, without it, I probably wouldn't be sleeping anyway.  But it forces me to take a benzodiazipine, which affects my memory and is not a long term solution. So, yes it works, and hopefully you won't experience insomnia. If you do, you'll probably up at 3 in the morning like me busy doing these reviews.

I am able to eat Italian green beans and snow peas. I never heard of fava beans until I started Nardil, and have no desire to try them. I use soy sauce whenever I wish.
Medications are a different story. Once when hospitalized for my type 1 diabetes, my endocrinologist gave me a ""diet"" pill, which name I don't recall. It raised my BP so high the staff brought the crash cart. I was glad I was IN the hospital. I avoid decongestants and treat allergies & asthma with antihistimes & steroidal meds.
I still take 90 mg/day, 3 tabs BID, but often forget the bedtime dose. I think I'm getting an average of 75 mg/day, and have no intention of discontinuing Nardil in the future."

It has saved my life.I've gone off about 4 times thinking I no longer needed it. LOL, not so. Dr. had me try newer anti-depressants but no relief. I did have a shortlived happy expierence with Abilify. I'm very fortunate I've not expierenced any side effects from any foods. However I can not drink wine. That tought me a valuable lesson. Hopefully I've got 10-15 years of life left and hopefully I can afford to buy Nardil as I know if it were not for this drug I would not be here today.

I had a number of terrible life stresses occur in my life all at the same time (divorce, only child moved out of state & got laid off from a job I loved for 25 yrs). These major stresses caused my severe depression to come back.  I tried everything under the sun.  Nothing worked. My doctor said I should have added lithium or another medication to boost the nardil, rather than going off it.  I feel lucky to be alive and am enjoying my life on nardil.
It truly is the ONLY medication that works for me. Thank you, God!!!!

I have been suffering with depression,Bipolar and social anxiety for most of my adult life, none of the SSRI's have worked. I just seemed to worse and gain weight. My past Dr's have tried everything, tyhroid therapy to increased levels of vit.D and light therapy, plus more, with all the tests I went through I felt like a human pin cushion. I was involved in a Prozac plus a unknown medication case study but was taken off the study due to extreme side affects and dangerous blood pressure increase.  I was told by the Dr's invovled that I was untreatable and would possibility have go it alone without medications for the rest of my life, until now I hope. I found a new understanding Dr., I've noticed a big difference in my mood after just a few weeks.  If you have being suffering with no response, talk to your Dr. about Nardil. Nardil so far is working for me, but I am a ""newbie"" and other the conficting food ""no-no's"" you read about. Nothing you read about with the food  interactions are the same from report to report.  I guess no one is the same?"

It's the best thing I have taken. I went off of it for about a year trying literally everything on the market. Nothing worked for me; except Celexa, but I had such bad memory problems is was not worth it. After going back to Nardil my life returned. I will never go off of it again. It's very sad to me that most doctor's do not even discuss it with their patients. It's a miracle drug and the fact that it has been around for so many years, only proves it's effectiveness and safety in spite of the diet restrictions.

Doctors kept asking me if I was depressed and I would respond ""no, I feel like I have felt my whole life. Wish I had not been born but decided that this was the way life was meant for me and managed to survive.""
Although I was considered brilliant and won many scholastic awards, I had no self-confidence. It wasn't until I was over forty years old, that a doctor insisted I try an antidepressent. He picked Nardil. After four to six weeks, EVERYONE noticed a change in me. People wouldcomment that they never saw me smile before. Never had any side effects (except in me, it could build up in my blood and I would end up in a manic state). I learned to sense when I was becoming manic and would discontinue use for two days and then go back to normal dosage. Miracle drug. Have nothing nice to say about the ssri's. Have been taking for over 20 years."
53$Condition: Depression$12/5/2009 10:25:36 PM$Reviewer: antiqueart, 65-74 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$"I have taken these meds since 1989 and have tried others but this is by far the best for me. Many doctors are leery of using MAOs and there are some things to watch. There can be negative interactions with things such as anti-histamines and some foods.  If you watch your food carefully and beware of things such as anti-histamines. Its best to consult a druggist with any over the counter drug just to be safe.... I plan to take this drug from now on. these is no generic and probably never will be so my insurance doesnt pay much on it. There are warnings about red wine...coffee and lots of things but one has to see what their tolerance is. Tou do have to limit coffee and red wine but I can tolerate about all I want to have.
If you have sinus and allergy problems you have to navigate what to do there. I can tolerate Claritin and get the generic which is cheap at Walgreen or CVS.  You have to pay careful attention to what you can tolerate without having an interaction.
A drug interaction here can cause high blood pressure and a bad feeling so one has to be on guard. You also need to know that you cannot tolerate things that are normally given to people in auto accidents and have to make sure that any paramedic knows you are on an MAO. Some people wear bracelets and necklaces to be safe but I dont I just have it in the window of my wallet. You need to review all this with your doctor."

I unexpectantly became pregnant.  My doctor gave me specific directions for weaning off off Nardil.  I followed them to the tee.  A week or two into the weaning process, I started convulsing, shaking uncontrollably.  This went on for three or four days and I lost my baby as a result.

My pharmacologist and I came to agree that I have an extremely active liver-- average dosing of any oral medication has never been effective for me, and so it was with this stuff. I ended up taking 90mgs daily (three 30mg doses) in order to get the desired effect. But, I eventually started having severe dizzy spells, and actually fainted on several occasions, assumingly due to dips in my blood pressure. I also accidentally ran out at one point (due to a nasty ice storm), and found out why they warn you not to stop cold-turkey. After 48 hours, I began shaking uncontrolably, and couldn't even hold a spoon steady enough to eat a bowl of cereal! It felt a lot like a miniature episode of Parkinsons disease. I did follow the directions (as much as possible) when it came to food and medication interactions, but it's powerful stuff, so please-- be careful!
