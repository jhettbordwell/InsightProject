0$Condition: Depression$2/27/2016 1:16:53 PM$Reviewer: LarryV,  Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I take Wellbutrin XL 300 mg and have been taking it for 6+ years. Prior to it, I tried every SSRI and newer drugs like Cymbalta. Wellbutrin is the only drug for depression that I could live with. ALL the others cause sexual problems, weight gain, sleepiness, fatique and still don't get rid of all the depression. One doctor added Zyprexa to the SSRIs I was taking and I put on 40 pounds! Getting off SSRIs are tough too. Electric shocks felt in my head and lights. Would never ever go back to them. Wellbutrin actually caused a boost in libido, weight loss and high energy. If I had it to do over again, Wellbutrin XL would be the starting med, not the SSRI classes. Think about it this way: If you're depressed now, how much more will you be when you lose interest in sex, gain weight, fall asleep at work, home, doctor's waiting room and have no energy to do anything? Those are the downsides of the SSRI class of meds. For me, they made my life worse. I am rarely depressed now and take nothing else for it but an occasional Xanax if in a highly stressful situation at work. I lost all the weight I gained, hike 5+ miles on weekends, kayak and have a normal sex life. Please give Wellbutrin a try and if it doesn't work after a month or so, then try the others.

I had been on Cymbalta and my psychiatrist suggested switching to Aplenzin. It worked wonderfully, made me feel even better than Cymbalta. Unfortunately it also caused me to experience auditory hallucinations. I was able to tell that the voices and music weren't ""real"" and was able to effectively ignore them, but they kept getting louder, so I switched back to Cymbalta."

8$Condition: Depression$1/13/2010 3:33:59 PM$Reviewer: shelly324, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've had depression ever since 15, and back then they gave me Celexa, an SSRI. Didn't make much of a difference, thought it was me. I went off that for a while and thought I just had to live with depression. 

Recently it started affecting me even more severely, so I looked into other medications. Welbutrin (bupropion) sounded like it was worth a try, since it affects dopamine receptors, not serotonin. I started it when I was 24, and what a difference it has made! It's been about a year now, and I can say that I actually feel normal. There is no long this yawning black hole over every day. There are still some days when I am sad, but it's relatively easy to get over it. The only bad thing about this drug was during the first 2 weeks of taking it: I had really bad insomnia, it was horrible. I had to take sleep aids every night. But that did eventually go away, now I sleep fine. 

Some people have said this drug is awful and no one should take it because it makes them super anxious/nervous/irritable, etc. Well that means it's probably the wrong drug for you. I would say, have an open mind, work with your doctor, and try different treatments until you find the one that works for you. This definitely worked for me, it has been a God send. "

It's better than Wellbutrin which is Buproprion hydroCHLORIDE. Smoother, less stimulation, fewer and less severe side effects. It's worth a try if buproprion seems to help but not just quite right for you.

What a mistake.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I wasn't really depressed anymore but very tired.  To tired to go to work some days.  Pay the extra and get Wellbutrin.

12$Condition: Depression$8/14/2009 2:33:44 PM$Reviewer: marcie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$2$5$"I've been on this medication for about 2 years, 300 mg daily.   There have been no unbearable side effects -- just a tendency toward constipation.

In the past, I've used others that were more effective, but had such bad side effects that I had to quit them. Overall, I think this takes the basic depression from about a constant 8 down to a constant 3 or 4.    There have been many episodes of being quite depressed while on it.  

Frankly, I'd rather take it than try other things.  I've used so many over the years, and I'm tired of experimenting.  "
13$Condition: Depression$7/28/2009 3:34:09 PM$Reviewer: Lana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$5$I have become very anxious taking this medication and will see my doctor in a few days to decide what to do. For now I am taking it every other day and feel better. It helped the depressive mood, but made me have panic attacks, sleep distrubance, rapid heart beating when awake.
