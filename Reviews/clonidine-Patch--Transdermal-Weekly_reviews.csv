0$Condition: High Blood Pressure$10/23/2017 12:12:46 AM$Reviewer: Anne, 65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$1$5$I have been using the Clonidine patch for a few years with good results. But this past month, I encountered what I think is a batch that will not adhere to my skin. I have been very careful to apply it to clean, dry skin. The first one barely made it the week. Thesecond one, three days, and I used the adhesive cover which itches after a few days. the third one lasted one day and I lost that one altogether. I went without two days, and put the last patch on under the adhesive cover in hopes it will last 11 days, as my pharmacy will not issue them early. they suggested I contact the mfr. I did. the most disturbing thing is I've gotten no response from them. The lot #is 1205025B

2$Condition: Tourette's$3/9/2014 7:42:17 PM$Reviewer: S.Silvers4, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$I've been taking Clonidine both in pill and patch forms since I was first officially diagnosed with Tourette's Disorder when I was 12 (even though I had severe symptoms of it all throughout my childhood up to and including the point of diagnosis). When I switched to the Catapres Clonidine Transdermal Patch around my high school years, I chose to because I had issues remembering how many pills I had to take and what times of the day I already took and would need to take them, and the patch offered me the option of only having to slap one on every week and that's it, no pills to keep track of or anything. I still keep the pills just in case I need an extra dose because my patch's effectiveness is dwindling towards the end of the week, but overall, the patch itself is not only handy and useful in both my remembering to take my medication, but it's also helped me significantly with being able to control and overcome my excessive movements, twitches, and tics, even though I'm not always able to completely stop them from occurring all the time. My only issue with this patch is how irritated it makes the parts of my chest where I keep it (which is inside near the upper portion of my bra - safer, less likely to fall off than if it were on my arm or elsewhere). The glue rubs off after a couple days of usage, and that might be because I take it off to shower or just because it wears off. And the glue does make the skin itchy, which I thought was partly due to my sensitive skin I have anyway even though the packaging states skin irritation may occur. Honestly, though? Even despite any side-effects I may have had growing up with this medication, I'm glad to have it, because it makes dealing with my condition so very much easier than if I never had it in the first place. Without it, it's difficult to function and stop twitching, so heed the warnings about not immediately stopping your dosage on it. If you need to stop, wean yourself off slowly at your doctor's advice!

4$Condition: High Blood Pressure$4/24/2013 5:24:46 AM$Reviewer: Justgene, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I've had uncontrolled bloodpressure for years even with med's, It's up and down. My family Dr. whom I been seeing for 30 some year's sent me to a cardiolgist, the Cardiolgist took me off some of my regular med's without talking it over with my family Dr. and put me on Clonidine patch, WELL !, it only took me one day to find out the patch wasn't for me !!!, got almost all the side effect and some, felt pressure building up in my chest and head and when I turned in for the night, thought I was going to have a heart attack or something. I knew what it was !, I didn't waste anytime ripping the patch off my arm and after an hour or so  without the patch I'm back to the same old me ! Going back to my old med's that I've been taking for year's and back to my family Dr. I'd rather life with my border line high blood pressure then with this drug ! ( Clonidine 0.2 MG/DAY patch ).       
5$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$10/2/2012 2:31:10 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$only been on the patch for 4 days but i had a restful night for the first time in months. I was almost suicidal (not really tho), and I am rested today and feeling more like me. Hope it lasts.
6$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$8/11/2012 8:44:22 PM$Reviewer: naomiathome, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$"I started to apply the patch more than 3 months ago for hot flashes. For 2 months this seemed to work just fine. Going into the 3rd month, I began exeriencing increasing flashes again. My doctor switched me from the brand to generic and I am waiting to see results. 

Side effects? 1) I get a localized skin reaction where the patch was applied, so I have square ""scars"" all over from each patch. 2) I have been getting small sores inside my nose, which could be a side effect, or could be something else, I just haven't had them before."

I was doing fine until the pharmacy changed suppliers.  Now I cannot tolerate the drug and it no longer controls the hot flashes due to Tamoxifin treatment for cancer.
8$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$6/19/2012 10:11:26 PM$Reviewer: karenb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I had breast cancer last year, very small tummor. They put me on meds to supress any hormones my body may be putting out even tho I had a complete hysterectomy over 12 years ago. The hot flashes have gotten increasingly worse. It's like taking a shower with my body providing the water For the first month I could NOT keep the patch on no matter what. I tried just the patch, the patch with the white cover and finally with bandaids over everything and even with these clear adhisive covers. NOTHING worked! Today the nurse said to try that sports wrap the sticks to itself. It  is stretchy and I can't imagine wearing all night without taking it off in my sleep since it constricting my arm and has to to stay on. I am overweight and have large upper arms whick may be a problem with the sports wrap. I can't say if it works or not since I haven't been able to keep one on! My friend is a massage therapist and has some type of a paper tape that may be able to work. I'll contrack her tomorrow. Maybe they don't expect women to have such hot and WET hot flashes when they made the patch.

11$Condition: Symptoms from Stopping Treatment with Opioid Drugs$2/2/2011 12:51:26 PM$Reviewer: Anna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$1$I was on morphine 90mg 3x a day for 2yrs. It's side effects and had stopped working so I,my Dr,husband decided to taper off. I went through withdrawals and was given clonidine for them as needed. After two mos. I was off the morphine. After a week I was still having withdrawals(my Dr.said not likely) but prescribed clonodine for my bp the cause of the withdrawals. This medication makes me feel like a zombie and my heart still races. She wants to put me on the patch. I want off this med.

One of the side effects of that med is excessive sweating that I found unbearable.  Now I wear a 0.1 mg Clonodine patch and it helps a lot to relieve this bothersome side effect.
13$Condition: High Blood Pressure$6/25/2010 1:22:37 PM$Reviewer: booskitten, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$have had hbp for years, olds meds did'nt cut it anymore. 48 hours after putting on the patch bp was great. the patch does'nt stick well and the cover does cause a rash, you can move the patch around but the rash stays around forever and you dont get extra covers. i cant say enough good about this patch its saved my life. bp was 140/123 now nice and normal 120/72. my only concern: i understand if you forget to replace the patch or loose it with out knowing your bp can skyrocket.

I was given a generic form and it made my blood pressure go sky high.  I almost died.  I must have the name brand.  What is the differnce in the name brand and generic that made my blood pressure go up so high?

19$Condition: High Blood Pressure$8/10/2008 3:38:34 PM$Reviewer: $4$3$5$I have used this for two weeks now, and I'm not sure I'm going to continue. I have experienced extreme tiredness and very dry mouth. I have not seen any dramatic change in my BP. I have also had significant weight gain since I started using this and it has only been 2 weeks! The patch is very easy to use but the cover did cause a rash and annoying itching. 
20$Condition: High Blood Pressure$9/30/2007 12:08:19 AM$Reviewer: slapbad, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$It leaves a very bad rash anywhere I put it and itches like crazy especially when submerged in water during a bath/shower. Otherwise,it's a good thing to use so far.
