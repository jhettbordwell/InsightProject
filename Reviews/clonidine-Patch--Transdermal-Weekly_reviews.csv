0$Condition: High Blood Pressure$10/23/2017 12:12:46 AM$Reviewer: Anne, 65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$1$5$I have been using the Clonidine patch for a few years with good results. But this past month, I encountered what I think is a batch that will not adhere to my skin. I have been very careful to apply it to clean, dry skin. The first one barely made it the week. Thesecond one, three days, and I used the adhesive cover which itches after a few days. the third one lasted one day and I lost that one altogether. I went without two days, and put the last patch on under the adhesive cover in hopes it will last 11 days, as my pharmacy will not issue them early. they suggested I contact the mfr. I did. the most disturbing thing is I've gotten no response from them. The lot #is 1205025B

2$Condition: High Blood Pressure$4/24/2013 5:24:46 AM$Reviewer: Justgene, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I've had uncontrolled bloodpressure for years even with med's, It's up and down. My family Dr. whom I been seeing for 30 some year's sent me to a cardiolgist, the Cardiolgist took me off some of my regular med's without talking it over with my family Dr. and put me on Clonidine patch, WELL !, it only took me one day to find out the patch wasn't for me !!!, got almost all the side effect and some, felt pressure building up in my chest and head and when I turned in for the night, thought I was going to have a heart attack or something. I knew what it was !, I didn't waste anytime ripping the patch off my arm and after an hour or so  without the patch I'm back to the same old me ! Going back to my old med's that I've been taking for year's and back to my family Dr. I'd rather life with my border line high blood pressure then with this drug ! ( Clonidine 0.2 MG/DAY patch ).       
3$Condition: High Blood Pressure$5/3/2011 10:41:20 AM$Reviewer: Cher 17, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$2$5$Have been using the patch for 3 months now, it has helped lower my BP but I don't like the side effects such as dry mouth, tiredness, blurred vision the first couple days when I put on a new patch. Am going to see doctor and see about discontinuing it.
4$Condition: High Blood Pressure$6/25/2010 1:22:37 PM$Reviewer: booskitten, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$have had hbp for years, olds meds did'nt cut it anymore. 48 hours after putting on the patch bp was great. the patch does'nt stick well and the cover does cause a rash, you can move the patch around but the rash stays around forever and you dont get extra covers. i cant say enough good about this patch its saved my life. bp was 140/123 now nice and normal 120/72. my only concern: i understand if you forget to replace the patch or loose it with out knowing your bp can skyrocket.
5$Condition: High Blood Pressure$6/19/2010 9:43:53 AM$Reviewer: worried, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I am afraid if they stop making this medication I will die of a severe heart attack.  I was given a generic form and it made my blood pressure go sky high.  I almost died.  I must have the name brand.  What is the differnce in the name brand and generic that made my blood pressure go up so high?

This medicine made my blood pressure go throw the roof. It was so high I thought I might just have a stroke.

10$Condition: High Blood Pressure$8/10/2008 3:38:34 PM$Reviewer: $4$3$5$I have used this for two weeks now, and I'm not sure I'm going to continue. I have experienced extreme tiredness and very dry mouth. I have not seen any dramatic change in my BP. I have also had significant weight gain since I started using this and it has only been 2 weeks! The patch is very easy to use but the cover did cause a rash and annoying itching. 
11$Condition: High Blood Pressure$9/30/2007 12:08:19 AM$Reviewer: slapbad, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$It leaves a very bad rash anywhere I put it and itches like crazy especially when submerged in water during a bath/shower. Otherwise,it's a good thing to use so far.
