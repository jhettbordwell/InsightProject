He said this is like seroquel on high. He told me to take this with Benadryl. I was really confused by this, but I did it anyways. First night was great fell asleep in 15 minutes. I didn’t like my whole mouth going numb though. I woke up the next morning feeling great. I didn’t feel tired or drugged out for the first time in a long time. I didn’t take a nap all day either. The next night I tried taking it without the Benadryl, and things didn’t go well. I didn’t get sleepy at all and I waited an hour. Then I went ahead and took the Benadryl and went to bed. The next day I still felt good. A on going problem I started having was my hands and feet would start to go numb out of nowhere. It would like 15 to 30 minutes. Then on the 3rd and final day I woke up with the driest mouth ever! I thought I will just drink some water, and I will be good. That was not what happened. I chugged water all day long at work. Nothing helped. It felt like a desert in my mouth. I am no longer taking it. I can’t deal with all that. My doctor gave me something else to help me sleep I pick it up
tomorrow. I am glad to hear that it has worked for a lot of you. "

5$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$4/1/2018 11:12:08 PM$Reviewer: Kitkatsaver, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Back when I was 13 i was given this med and set off to school with my parents thinking I'll be fine. I got to school and was giggling with my then foster sister and all of a sudden i wasn't able to move. I had my then foster sister call my mother because the office lady didnt like me and wouldnt let us use her phone anyways my then foster sister set me in the office where i felt like i was drifting off... My mom showed up saw me first glance and rushed me to the emergency room. My heart stopped my mom was worried i was going to die. I was admitted to the hospital. I guess I had a allergic reaction and they told me if I had a stronger dosage i wouldn't have made it... Its sad that one pill can take a life. Anyways i know other people who have been on it and said they didn't like it. So 1000% wouldn't recommend.

Taking 5 in morning and 10 at night. I have not had the numbness and to me it doesn't taste that bad. Makes me a little tired but still function fine. I was on limictal and had all of the side effects including the rash. Ended up in psyh. Ward for hallucinations. I was on a very low dose too.(25mg daily) this is not meant for bipolar and should be watched for these if used. If rash appears go directly to ER. This is deadly.

My dr put me on a few different meds like risperidone, abilify, even zyprexa. The Zyprexa made me sleep 20 hours a day and I could barely function. Then we tried Saphris. Life changer! I am currently on 20mg at night and I can sleep well and wake alert and ready for the day. It puts me to sleep within an hour of taking it so definitely take it when planning to go to sleep. It has cleared my thinking, diminished the agitation and paranoia pretty well, and calmed my urges to hurt myself from the anxiety I was feeling. My dr recently changed my diagnosis to Schizoaffective because I was having some break through hallucinations even outside of a mood episode but upping the dose to 20mg has helped rid me of those for the most part. I haven't gained any weight and my appetite has remained normal. Now I have been at my current job for over a year when I was struggling to function daily before starting Saphris. I thank God that I have my life back and feel great on it along with 200mg Lamictal and 10mg Lexapro for depression. I wish the best to all who are trying this new med!

23$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$5/29/2015 10:27:46 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I was given this medication to help with Bipolar Disorder and depression. I rather like medications taken in this manner. Mine was flavored but it melts so quickly that the flavoring is a waste. I could handle the tingling but, as someone else said, waiting 10 minutes before drinking something is nearly impossible. I have noticed no difference in my non-sleep pattern; I was hoping for at least 4-5 hours of sleep but remain at my 2-3 hours. What I have noticed is that after taking Saphris I feel the way I think one must feel after going on an alcohol bender; totally drunk, bouncing off walls, and in a total mental fog that lasts for many hours.

I do this 10 minutes before I go to bed and it puts me to sleep right away and I always have a  peaceful nights sleep. It has worked very well for my bi-polar condition. I take it along with Pristiq and Vivanse. I also take Topamax. I take 5mg. of Saphris, 100mg. of Pristiq, 40mg. of Vivanse and 100mg. of Topamax. Its the perfect combination. I take 10 mg. of Saphris in the wintertime. I was suicidal years ago but no longer feel that way and no longer feel depressed or have bi-polar episodes taking these medications. I feel great.

Primary symptoms are depression and severe anxiety. Saphris is a wonder drug for me.  I take 20 mg at night, because it knocked me out to take it in the morning.  Anxiety is almost completely gone, and I feel like a normal person for the first time since I was diagnosed 12 years ago.
I hold the tablets under my tongue without moving and the taste isn't bad if you follow it up with a piece of chocolate.  Find I want to eat everything in sight once I take it, but since it puts me to sleep within 20 minutes, I don't stay up and eat.  During the day, it doesn't affect my appetite at all, and I've lost the weight I gained on Seroquel,"

A week after the 10 mg dose increase, I started to feel insane anxiety and depression.  It is as though a light switch went off and everything was different.  All joy for life is gone, the way I look at everything is clouded, dark, constant thoughts of death, meaninglessness, hopelessness...going off this drug!!!

I was waking up what seemed a million times a night with panic attacks and just crying, uncontrollably! Now, I take 5mg of black cherry Saphris about 15 minutes before I wanna go to sleep. Within minutes of it dissolves under my tongue and I fall asleep very shorty afterwards . My tongue does go numb but it doesn't last long. Thanks to this pill, I no longer wake up at all! Not until its time to get up. It allows my mind to rest and no more waking up crying. SO THANK YOU SAPHRIS MAKERS! GOD SENT!!!!!!

I did not stay on it very long because it gave me an incredibly uncomfortable, disconcerting feeling.  I took it shortly before bed, and it would give me this odd jolt of energy, fidgetiness, and anxiety.  I felt like I had to rush to bed.  I would end up sleeping okay, but that was a very bad feeling.  More importantly, it did not make me feel less depressed or anxious, and I felt tired even after sleeping okay, so I stopped taking it in just a few weeks.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

I was on Risperdal before and that made me gain 25 lbs but I have to say this medication has increased my appetite even more. It also numbs my mouth and tongue and messes with my taste buds. I've been kind of Hypo-manic since I've been taking it so my mood hasn't crashed yet, but I am going to stop taking it, a lot of the reviews on here say Saphris is great at stabilizing mood. I really wish I could stay on it to see that but I have to take care of my diabetes and blood sugars so need to find another anti-psychotic, have tried quite a few so far and haven't found a good match yet.

I felt good. I was sleeping and had a lot of energy that wasn't mania. I took it in the morning because I couldn't sleep after taking it; it made me feel nervous at first.  My symptoms gradually got worse until about 3 weeks after beginning Saphris I noticed that I would get restless and have trouble sitting still about 2 hours after taking the drug. Then after 5 weeks I noticed a ""fluttering"" feeling in my chest and sometimes my heart would pound and race so hard that it felt like it would jump right out of my chest.
This is a side effect that I've experienced with some other mood stabilizers (anti-pyschotics).

Soon after I began hallucinating that I knew every stranger in a different from school or work all day. I had the cops called on me for having a breakdown over thinking my dead grandmother was still alive to a woman and the ambulance took me to the ER. There I exclaimed to the entire ER  to listen to me because I was Obama (I'm a white girl), had a seizure, risked falling into a coma, and stayed in the psych ward for 2 days when recovered. All because I took Saphris that was prescribed to me. It was terrifying and life altering.

I was in a very bad car wreck in 04 that wasn't my fault... That kicked off my mania side of my depression and manic side 
of bipolar started getting violent (which I'm not a violent person) but I started screaming at everyone even my dogs so it was a miracle when my doc introduced me to saphris... Had all the same things u guys have numb tongue,  bad taste,  even started feeling better too,  however,  this next one scared me... I started having shortness of breathe... I walked across a parking lot and I literally thot I was going to need CPR...  It literally took 5 times the amount of time normal for me to catch my breathe...  When ur greatest fear us suffocating that's a huge problem... I immediately called my doc office and told them I was done but they suggested taking benadryl with it...  So I ask if u have these problem please email me at [email protected]  Please let me know if it went away or what u did to get past it...  I'm sitting here holding my benadryl and my saphris but I can't get over it to take it... Thanks for any help advice or responses.... "

People complain that the bad taste Is a real drawback but I don't see why that should really matter, I don't mind the taste, I find the meds work which is what people should be talking about. This is the first stabilizer to actually work, Lamictal did nothing for me and I have suffered on it for years being uncontrolled, in terrible rapid mixed episodes. I have been on absolutely everything on the market and this is the first med I find to actually be helping me. It makes me really tired but it helps me sleep at night, a little bit of difficulty sometimes in the morning. I hope to be able to take it in the the morning in the future and I hope it doesn't knock me out.  Hopefully it keeps working and things get better and better

After 6 weeks I became depressed with anxiety. This continued and I continued to take the Saphris for ten more weeks then had an allergic reaction. (Gagging, pulling on throat, rapid heartbeat and uncontrolled shaking, all lasting 45 minutes.) So I stopped taking Saphris cold turkey. The withdrawal symptoms were very hard. Severe insomnia for 22 days. diarrhea for 7 days. Also, weeks of Cotton-dry mouth, no appetite, nervousness, nausea and rapid heartbeat. Finally, I am sleeping normal and have an appetite and feel normal after 24 days. Saphris didn't work out for me. I could not take it during the day, only 10mg at night as it made me too drowsy. I'd rather deal with my moods on my own than go through the adverse reactions of Saphris.

This combination works for me and it's great for sleep. I don't know how anybody could take it in the morning. I find it very sedating. The taste is yucky too. I dry the area under my tongue with a tissue before I take it and then I hold it there (no moving your tongue). This way there's less saliva coming up on the taste buds on the sides and top of my tongue.

The dr. on duty said it looked like i had mild stroke as well. I'v had seizures in the past maybe 5. Since i was on that med. i had a seizure and maybe a mini stroke. my blood pressure went down as well and dilantin levels were low. now she wanted me to start 80mg of ziprasidone luckily i didnt but was on 60mg for depression. Geodone was also a med she gave me which had side effects. Right now she has me on lamotrigine 25mg. Thats taken once aday in the afternoon. with that also im on Saphris of which helps me sleep but given as mood stablizer. My question is with my health problems. Are these two meds okay to take? Im a diabetic, and take phenytoin to control seizures, and metformin, gemfibrozil, and asprin 325mgs for diabetes. i take oxycodone for fibromyalgia and arthritis every now and then and they are 5mg. Lisinopril 5mg i dont have high blood pressure but they give it to me so i dont have high blood pressure. im kind of afraid now to take new meds. the meds i take for diabetes i havent had any problems. what do you think? I need help because i dont think this psychologist isnt realizing whats happening. she says this all ok. I had side effects to her meds. I dont want to be a statistic to her meds.

Insist that your psych prescribe the black cherry flavored saphris.  It's still bad tasting, but is 100% better than the original. After removing the pill from the foil pack, place it in the middle area under your tongue. Avoid talking or moving your tongue for the required 10 min. This takes patience and practice. The pill will dissolve quickly causing a lot of saliva. After the 10 min., swallow the built-up saliva, immediately brush your teeth (and tongue if it bothers you), and go to bed soon after because saphris is very sedating, especially at first. If you can get past the taste, you may find it a very useful drug. I find it effective for sleep, keeping you awake during the day, depression, and stopping obsessive/suicidal thoughts. Good Luck.

For the first time in my life I feel my sleep/wake pattern has been corrected. I can get out of bed in the morning, stay awake all day and fall asleep in 15-30 min. It quiets my racing, obsessional thoughts and stops the suicidal thoughts. Now I can concentrate on talk therapy and having a life! I still have too strong of an appetite so it hasn't corrected that. I also still feel some depression, lack of drive and low energy. Psych has prescribed 10 mg. of Prozac to help me out, especially since I just lost a beloved pet. Saphris is not a magic bullet, but I find it effective with few side effects. I hope the effectiveness doesn't wear off! It works for me, but may not work for you. Don't give up and don't wait to get help. Be patient and find out what drug works for you and stay on it long enough to let it work.Good Luck!

67$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$10/19/2012 1:36:59 PM$Reviewer: jantuggy, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $3$1$3$"I began taking Saphris for mixed state bipolar disorder on 8/23/12 in order to gradually discontinue Seroquel which had lost its effectiveness in treating my depression and extreme fatigue.  I developed a euphoric renewed energy and decreased need for sleep, which I attributed to discontinuation of Seroquel, and effectiveness of Saphris, and thought my symptoms of prolonged dizziness and nausea were the result of physically adjusting to it.  After Seroquel was DC'd, the Saphris caused a increase in dizziness, pressure inside my head, nausea & fatigue, partly due to lack of sleep without Seroquel. On 10/15/12, continued usage caused an alarming pressure inside my head, which escalated to the degree that I felt like I was overdosing & was transported to my nearest E.R. I was unable to walk, make eye contact, or think clearly enough to give the medical team accurate and necessary information. 
After nearly 4 hours of unnecessary medical testing (thyroid, EKG, blood work), I was treated with an IV of Ativan for anxiety and Phenotil for nausea and released.  It was concluded that I had an allergic reaction to Saphris and was advised to discontinue it immediately. I regretted not having requested to be transported to the nearest psychiatric hospital because my symptom of pressure in the head as a result of taking Saphris would have been diagnosed much sooner.  Dizziness is a normal side effect of Saphris, and usually subsides after a few days. I strongly caution any user who develops any pressure in your head that continues to increase to reconsider or discontinue usage."

It gives a slight tingling of the tongue and bitterness but at this stage I hardly notice it and it passes in less than 20 minutes. It is helping me so much to feel alert, think clearly and sleep easily. Also I have found I eat less and am not as hungry as I was on Abilify and am finally losing weight again which I am really grateful for. I was suffering major depression and anxiety and combine Cymbalta with Saphris for these conditions. I can now honestly say I have no more symptoms of either condition and am truly delighted. It's definitely worth trying especially if you have found other antipsychotics to be a problem.

I already have problems with bladder spasms but the medication I am on for that along with bladder suspension surgery had that under control.  As I've only been taking Saphris for two nights, I plan to continue to use it a while longer but begin wearing incontinence pads at night & protect the bedding.  I also suffer with depression and bipolar disorder and feel it is beginning to help those conditions as well.  Overall, I feel this is a good medication.

I've been through the ringer as far as medications are concerned. After many years of different medications, I'm now taking Valium, Saphris & Buspar. I've only been on the Saphris for 11 days now, after months of Seroquel found to be ineffective for me. I can tolerate the numbness/tingling of my mouth as well as the nasty taste (wish that was the worst part of it). I realize that as with all meds they take time to take full affect. In the short time I've been on the 10mg dose, I'm finding that I have a very LOW tolerance for anything. I get rather irritated & have less of a tolerance for anything. I can't say for sure it's the meds but I can say I'm not usually agitated to the point of throwing things, screaming about what seems to be nothing & wanting to physically beat something or someone. This I find extremely disturbing and am unsure if it's normal & will pass or if I need to seek help. I have mixed feelings about this med. Hopefully my next visit to my Dr will help explain something. I would recommend asking about things of this nature before agreeing to take the medication.

I am also taking lexapro.  Taking this drug sublingually is a pain, mainly because it tastes horrible.  I am also convinced that this drug caused the severe panic attacks I was having, which seemed dose-dependent (I was on both 5 and 10 mg of Saphris).  Upon first taking the drug, I would get severe restless legs that would last for about 3 hours.  The drug makes me very drowsy, but it was hard to sleep with severely restless legs.  This side effect went away after about a week on the drug.  I am no longer taking this drug because I found it ineffective and could not tolerate the panic  attacks.  The attacks are pretty much gone now that I am off of the Saphris.

I had to get my husband to take to the bathroom and bring me back, I had all the bad side effects, Just had catact surger in my left eye the week before and cause me not to see as good as I did when I had the surgery. Plus I gained weight over night and legs and feet start swelling.  I will never be on the drug ever again. I was serverely manic at the time and my doctor told me to watch how I take it because I was so sensitve to medicine in the first place. I don't recommend anyone taking this medicine.  My doctor did what he thought was best when he gave it to me and if I had any problems to get off of it which I did.

Its slow going but I am sticking to the Atkins diet of 20 cars a days and exercising everyday 15 min. of cardio and 45 mins of yoga and i am drinking 64oz of water a day which in a large squirt bottle is quit easy. I am losing 1-2 lbs a week and my goal is one year to lose all the weight. Saphris makes me hungry but the more water i drink the more full I feel and it cleans out all of the toxins in my body so I would highly recommend my routine for anyone who is suffering with the weight gain. Best of luck

I was very sedated the first few nights on 5mg. However, i am now on 10 at bedtime and it knocks me out. I might have to cut back on the trazodone i usually take for sleep.

Unlike other drugs, I have no problem with weight gain, blood sugar and am loosing weight again, which improves my mood by itself.

Unlike Serequel, while it puts me to sleep at night easily, I wake up wide and refreshed with no hang over.

And did I say it doesn't make me hungry after taking it so no weight gain.

I still believe the best anti-depressent is exercise so this supports that 100%.

The second night I kept waking up due to restlessness...I absolutely hated the way it made me feel. I was so sleepy but could not rest. After 1 week, I'm at work crying ALL DAY and back and forth to the bathroom crying, crying and crying so much all day. Then comes the thoughts that death has to be better than living like this. My mom was livid and hated seeing me like that. I had to stay with her because she wouldn't let me go home by myself. I haven't felt a low like this in a veyr, very long time. I stopped taking it on my own. I'll never be in this again. But the black cherry flavor was better. If you ever feel like this call you're doctor immediately...I've been through the works with these meds and just ready to stop ALL of them...I am way too sensitive to these side effects. I'm tired of the up and downs with these. But I must say that the Saphris was the worst...Good luck if you're taking this...

After the first 2 days I noticed a tremendous difference in my mood. I felt great. I wasnt as depressed, I felt very calm, and actually had alot of energy. I seemed to have a peacefullness feeling.  I also have taken Depakote, Seroquel and others medications that did not work and had horrible side effects.  I was very hesitant about starting another new medication because I had taking everything and nothing seemed to work. This is like a miracle for me! I have noticed my hands and feet have swollen when I awake in the morning but it eventually goes away after a few hours once I start moving around. So far that is the only side effect.  I start on 10mg tonight. Hopefully it will still keep improving.  If everything else has failed I would definiely give this medication a try.  Within the first couple of days I could definitely tell a tremendous difference. It definitely puts me to sleep within an hour after taking it at night and I do sleep alot better.

I have been suffering with BP II for 22 years (heavy on the depression), and this little, awful-tasting pill has given me hope I've never had. I've been on it for about a year, and it's still working. The only side effect I've had is tiredness. I take it before bed to minimize the effect, but I still wake up very tired. Sometimes it afects my ability to start the day. Still, the benefits greatly outweigh the side effect. My advice....ask for the black cherry flavor only! It's hardly tasty, but 200% better than the taste of the original.

People talk about the taste...it's nothing compared to the hell that I have just returned from.

I'm sure there will be adjustments...seems like there always are with me but I pray that it continues to work.

First & second doses seemed to agree with her. Third dose, she suddenly was having difficulty standing, was confused, and had some muscle weakness. I do know that this med is making her sleepy, which at night is GREAT, but she needs to take it during the day as well. Wonder if these ""side effects"" will go away with a little time. She also has a history of seizures, but she has not had any since starting Saphris. My daughter would say that she was hearing voices, but hasn't mentioned the voices since she started on this med. However, it may be too soon to tell if Saphris made those voices go away for good. "

I have been taking it for a month now.  I took 5 mg at night for 20 days and have been taking 10mg at night for the rest of the time.  The taste is awful for sure.  But as soon as it dissolves I throw 2 altoids in my mouth and chew them up.  That really helps.  I do binge for about 30 min after the med kicks in.  It kicks in fast.  I make sure to binge on healthy food and do not allow unhealthy food in the house to binge on.  So far no wt gain.  Then I immediately fall asleep.  The sleep is good but I do wake up about every 2 hours, but fall right back to sleep.  I make sure to stay very well hydrated with water and unsweet tea.

Since increasing my dose I have noticed a lot of irritability, but it coincided with PMS time, so I am waiting to see which is actually causing the anger and irritability.  Psychosis is completely gone! NO paranoia at all now.  I have been disabled from BP and other mental dx, and am able to work part time now.  I have taken ALL new and old ap's and above all, this is the best one I have tried so far.

I have tried every possible anti-depressant marketed with the exception of a few. I had no choice but to retire from a 20 year career. After about a year with my new physc, trying basically all the new anti-depressants on the market, it would relieve some of the symptoms for a short period of time then nothing!! At last we thought we had found the right combination of meds to deal with my illness. I started taking Celexa, Lamactil, xanax and trazadone. That lasted for about 2 years then my symptoms came back with a vengance!! My doctor gave me samples of Saphris SL, discontinued the Celexa and cut my trazadone in half, they told me about the terrible taste so I was expecting that. I have been on the Saphris SL for about 4 weeks at bedtime and stopped the trazadone because the combination was so sedating. I would sleep for 2-3 hrs and wake up sometimes needing to go the the restroom and I couldn't even function, I could hardly hold my eyes open and my coordination was limited at best, much to my regret, I have turned into a monster! I have never been a violent person even with my illness. My family noticed the change in me after about 2 weeks of taking the medication and I am gaining weight rapidly and serious swelling all over. I did start to notice that pretty much anything anyone said to me made me angry. I blew it off as stress, but never have I experienced such aggitation before. I continued to take the medication for 2 more weeks trying to give it a fair shot. Last night to my horror I started throwing everything I could find at the wall!!!! I grabbed my car keys and off I went. Thankfully I arrived home safe., I knew it had to be the medication. Last night I quit taking it and will NEVER take it again.  I DO NOT recommend this. Please read ALL of the reviews on this medication. If it works,I wish you the best.

I take 10mg in the morning and 10mg at night. It makes me tired i feel like doing nothing and my anger has gotten worse I just flip out for no reason sometimes or vice versa I will be sad for no apparent reason. All in all it hasnt been the worst drug I have taken but it certainly isn't the best either. So if your over weight to begin with I wouldnt reccomend this medication at all cause it will make you gain a lot of weight! and also if you love sex i wouldnt take it either like i said my drive is non existent.

I have been on so many combinations of meds that I can't even write them down. I have not gained weight, I lost weight. I  had episodes of psychosis and was put on saphris. Since then I feel great. The taste is horrible but I got used of it. I'd rather put up with the horrible taste than lose touch with reality again. You do get used of the taste. I have to only take it at night because it will knock me out. But that is a good thing for me. I go thru periods that I don't sleep or sleep only 2 or 3 hrs a night. I have had a great experience with saphris and love it. The best medication I have been on. I started taking it in April 2010. Its great because I'm not a huge combination of meds like in the past. I have narrowed it down to just taking saphris and topamax. Oh, I did have a period that I was really depressed but dr. put me on wellbutrin and felt a little better after that. No longer on wellbutrin. I feel great, no episodes of psychosis in 8 months, I feel stable. One thing I did notice is that if I did miss one or two doses it would effect my moods in a big way. Have to make sure you take everyday!!!

It does cause your tongue to go numb with unusual taste.  I do not like how it makes me want to binge eat a few minutes after taking it.  I can only take at night before bed because it knocks me out.  I have gained a ton of weight because of this so I am not going to continue using it.  I would recommend you try it you may not have the urge to binge. We all metabolize medication differently.  I just cant afford to keep gaining weight after Depakote and this Saphris I am depressed from weight gain.  I have to try something that wont cause me to retain water or binge eat at night.

Give yourself a 6-8 hour time frame to rest. The taste is bad but so far the effects are going very well for me. I have been Bipolar for many many years and I have been on many different medications. I have trouble sleeping but when I take this before I lay down I wait the 10 minutes like I am suppose to and drink something with flavor to wash the taste away. Yes it does make my mouth under my tongue numb(where I put it) to dissolve. If you can keep it under your tongue do it. My normal reaction on first couple doses brought it above my tongue. Don't its worse tasting and makes your whole tongue numb. Then I lay down and that is all I remember for the next few hours. Don't try to do anything after taking it, Just rest. The side effects I do not have yet and may not have. I am in the time frame of my most possible manic state of the month, I do not feel that everything is 100 fold worse then it really is. I can say this is working for me. Please keep in mind when reading these reviews that most of us are in a state of saddness, moody, etc... it is why we are taking it to begin with. No medication has it full effect for at least 30-40 days. When trying this medication please give it 30-40 days before you decide on its full effect for you.

I was in a deep suicidal depression and my new psychiatrist decided to try Saphris on me. Within two days I could feel the depression lift. Just as others have reported the first three doses knock you off your feet, literally. When you wake up (especially without a full nights sleep) you almost feel like you are in a drunken state. The medication doesn't taste horrible, but it definitely is unpleasant. Your mouth goes numb, there is a lot of drool, and you can't eat or drink for 10 minutes. Definitely the worst part of my day. However, I have tried Seroquel, Depakote, Abilify, Cymbalta(made me go SUPER MANIC), Lexapro, and countless others. I'm a little over a month in and I've had to gradually increase my dose but it has worked well. The depression went away within days and hasn't came back and my rapid bursts of hypomanic/manic behavioral symptoms gradually have faded. Before Saphris I was coming off of a roller coaster that had given me 40 hours sleep in 20 days, a depression so deep I was giving up on life, and a lost faith in medication. No drug works the same for everyone but I do recommend that you at least give this one two weeks and see how it turns out. I haven't experienced any of the muscle twitches but I do have hand tremor. A little tremor is worth the sleep and stability I am getting, I just wish this drug was a little cheaper.

This drug has squashed the mania and psychosis, but has spurred on a depression so deeply, that I know I won't climb out unless I go off of it. I am flatlined with no emotion except overwhelming sadness. This is not me, it is the drug. As for the taste, if you're desperate enough like me, it's something you have to endure. Takes like you're sucking on codeine cough syrup, but I had high hopes and didn't care. I'm going to the doc this morning. It's that or a hospital, and that's not an option.

My spouse says I'm a grouch when I forget to take my pill by 7:30 PM.  So, far.  Taking the pill in the AM is problematic.  I and the Doctor are both waiting another month and then I will start taking the AM pill.  The initial druggyness worries me because I am a working professional and - well I do not need more problems than what I have now.  Reasoning - I was hospitialized and tried several meds.  I even took a month off from work.  With Saphris, life goes on.  Thoughts of taking my life are fading away.  The manic appears to be slowed but I need more time to adequately evaluate.  I am sorry others appear to be having problems.  A one or two time use doesn't give this drug a chance to really start working.  I am on for over two months.  Hey!  I am alive versus the alternative.

I had severe wrist pain in both wrists, headaches, neck pain, and sleep disturbances.  

I switched from Abilify to see if I could lose weight because I gained over 70 pounds on Abilify but was a normal, functioning adult.

After being diagnosed as a DIP (ha! and I have my papers), I switched back to Abilify.

I have lost countless hours and time and travel.  I was on Saphris for over six months and my pain steadily got worse.  It was excruciating.  

Please be aware of DIP when taking Saphris!!!"

The depakote worked, but three out of three dr's say it's causing breast milk. As if you don't feel sexy enough to gain weight and be psycho?  The saphris dissolves quickly, tastes like poo, and makes your mouth numb. However, my agitation is alot less, I have noticed some more anxiety, but that's what the xanax is for. I have noticed more joint pain than before, and the pain meds don't work as well on saprhis. How is this possible? All in all, I'm alive, and need less sleep than with depakote. I can actually wake up at a decent hour...but it's honestly more time for joint pain. BLECH

Won’t lie there.   But having tried literally every other drug similar to this in the past 12 years, I am getting the best results I have ever had with any of them.  And it is fairly weight-neutral - nothing a little extra time at the gym and some good food choices won't overcome.  NOTHING like the 40 pounds I put on in 8 weeks with Zyprexa.  Currently, I take 10 mg of Saphris each night with 60 mg of Prozac each morning...and my depression is better than is has been in years (without being manic).

My advice: just put up with the taste for 10 minutes.  It’s not that bad if you do it carefully…and I’d much rather have a bitter taste in my mouth followed by a little temporary numbness than the crazy weight gain I was getting from other atypical antipsychotics I was being prescribed for my treatment resistant depression (which has been argued to be Bipolar II Disorder...but really, what does the specific diagnosis matter?  I was super depressed for a long time...and now I'm not).

Now here’s the catch: my insurance is NOT covering this drug yet.  Luckily my psychiatrist has been giving me samples for like 6 months now.  Hope we can keep this arrangement up until this gets added to my insurance formulary (or we can successfully appeal the insurance company to cover it).  I really don’t want to go back to the way things were before I found this drug.

Every drug works differently for every person.  But if you have tried all the other options, don’t be scared to try this one.  A bitter taste in your mouth is a small price to pay for what might be the right med choice for you.

Oh, and when I started taking the Saphris, I started seeing positive results within my first week of taking it.  I wasn't “cured” overnight or anything like that, but things started getting noticeably easier within the first few days of having this med. 

Good luck, and don’t be scared to try it – it may be the wonder drug for you!  I know it was for me..."

The taste was horrible, it's nearly impossible to wait an entire 10 minutes before drinking something. My entire tongue, lower jaw and throat were numb for at least 20 mins later. I haven't noticed any improvement in my depression.  I actually feel more depressed than usual after taking this medication for over a month. The worst part is by far the taste, followed by the massive weight gain. I have gained 12 lbs. in one month!! The medication caused drowsiness for about an hour, but I still couldn't sleep throughout the night.  Sleep was restless. Not convinced so far, especially for the high cost.

Kind of leary when Dr. prescribed this sublingual, but the difference is amazing! I HATE the taste and when it dissolves it fills my mouth with saliva as well as numbs my tongue.  I also hate having to wait ten minutes after to eat or drink. It's the worst part of my day.  However, prior to starting this medicine I was constantly thinking about suicide or attempting it, my moods were all over the place with rage, impatience, and lack of motivation and I hadn't written anything worthwhile in over a year.  I also was only getting about two hours of sleep a night.  This medication does make me drowsy so, I take it right before I go to bed and sleep like a baby, waking up pert and perky (something that's never happened until now).  No signs of depression or suicidal thoughts and I love the fact that I feel like a normal woman.  It's really been a miracle for me and even my husband has noticed. I've been on this about a week, so I hope Saphris is the one for me. So far I haven't had any negative side effects.

Taking with Paxil and it seems to help some, but dr increased Paxil too, so not sure which one is working on the depression.  I wouldn't say my tongue gets numb - it's like drinking a really hot cup of coffee & burning your tongue, but it only lasts a hour.  Awful taste goes away quick.  I take it at night and it makes me drowsy & helps me sleep, tho I read about people having restless legs with it.  I already have that so not sure, but I feel more rested the next morning so I guess I have the opposite reaction.  We'll see.  Already had weight gain with Abilify and only been on Saphris for 10 days, so not sure about that side affect.  I want to continue and see what happens - maybe it's just the increase in Paxil that helped!

I would wake and remain useless and tire for an addition two hours. My behavior is far more irritable than ever before, and I find myself full of anger and wanting to pound my fists through the wall, or destroy sometime just because it was within arms reach. I find the taste of this medication absolutely repulsive. My appetite has spiraled out of control and I have gained 17 pounds in the last two months. My Diabetes is hyperglycemic with blood sugars above 200, thus requiring higher than normal insulin injections with greater CC's of insulin per injection. Finally, the copayment is prohibitive, even after insurance pays their pittance-share.

I do not reccommend this medication whatsoever. I will never try it for a third time.

I guess a good number is around 100 or so. I came in at 280!!!!!!! Somehow this mixes in with the weight gain, I don't yet know all I need to know.

Brushing the tongue 10 min. after taking the tablet helps with the numbness of the tongue.     It gets the residual medication out of your mouth as well. 
I still get tired about 1 hour after I take it in the morning or night.  This is the same side effect I had taking Seroquel.  However Seroquel knocked me out for 10 hours at night and did not affect me during work hours.  Saphris only seems to make me really tired for about one hour.  However I seem to have difficulty keeping my mind awake from about 9:00AM to noon.  I take my pills at regular intervals: 8-9:00PM at night and 6-7:00AM in the morning."

It took me a little while to get used to taste and the numbness it left in my mouth but after that it is not so bad.  With the goodness I get from it dealing with the bad taste is a small thing to deal with.

I was on seroquel 25 mg's twice daily and 300 mg's of Seroquel XR befre bedtime but now am taking this 1st night 5 mg's, 2nd night took 2 5mg's of it and feel really bad. I am anxious/depressed. I do not like
this med. and do not have schizophrenia. I am not psychotic or bi-polar. Beware of this
medicine unless you are aware of these possible problems. I am 49 and seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety/depression only.I am hurting so bad now. "

I took first dose at night and next day felt better than I had in 6 months, it does taste pretty bad,let dissolve and try to produce little saliva(if it is possible) and try not to swallow the medicine. maybe a patch would be a good idea? 
246$Condition: Other$1/14/2010 12:50:09 AM$Reviewer: Terrif, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$2$First, as others have stated...THE TASTE IS AWFUL. Are we being punished? Second, my entire mouth is numb for well over an hour - what's up with that? Third, for it's use as a mood stabilizer (in my case) it makes me agitated/anxious, so I need Klonazipam to level me. Also, right after I take it, I feel very spaced-out and my verbal skills are in the toilet. Dr. had me switch from p.m. to a.m. dose as it was affecting my sleep. I am also taking it every other day; EVERY DAY is way too much.  Very strange drug. While my energy is up and my thoughts are clearer, we will see where the build-up goes with the 40 days' samples.

Helps me sleep, but can't function until the dose wears off. Have taken it for two weeks and am not noticing much improvement in mania/mixed state. Side effects: (1.) after taking, tounge and throat are numb for up to an hour so I don't eat or drink because of possibility of choking, (2.) tastes terrible but the bad taste only lasts for a minute or two, (3.) Feet and ankles are swelling. My guess is this drug is probably more effective for schizophrenia than it is for bipolar.

I am not convinced that it is working for me because I feel worse but I will give it another day or so.  It does taste very bad and then makes your tongue numb.   Not good

It burns your mouth and made me want to vomit.  It better turn out to be a miracle drug for all that.
