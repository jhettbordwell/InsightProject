0$Condition: Bipolar Disorder in Remission$10/2/2019 4:07:54 AM$Reviewer: Carley, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I took Abilify 30mg orally from 2006 to 2015 then was placed on Abilify Maintaina 400 in 2015 to May of 2019. This is a Miracle Drug for me. I had 0 side effect and 0 side affects affecting my long term physical health! It also managed my schizo effective bi polar symptoms as I had none. I was placed on Aristada indecio, the new replacement for Abilify Maintaina in May 2019 I've been to the ER 5xs since with physical health issues related to this injection. Nausea,constipation, dizziness, my tongue swelled after the initial dose. And was treated with a Benzodiazapine that interacts with this new so called aristada. I 250% approve of Abilify after research for my own wellbeing. Muscle spasms an Charlie horse like cramps in my ribs and back, muscle dignity. Now my eyelids have begun to twitch from aristada. I 0% approve of Aristada at least for me.  Concerned Consumer. 
1$Condition: Schizophrenia$1/29/2019 3:45:44 AM$Reviewer: BStudent, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I gained 100 lbs. while on Abilify. I was on the pills first for years, then they switched me to these injections. I went from weighing 145 to 245 lbs. I am miserable, but am FORCED to take this. It is as if it is drying me out in my digestive system: I have been constipated ever since I've been on it, and have to keep a bottle of Milk of Magnesia on hand to relieve that. And I cannot urinate like I used to. The quantity of liquid coming out of me is much less than the amount I drink. The only good thing I can say is that it makes me feel less sleepy than other anti-psychotic medications. I agree with the other reviewer's post: This medication is poison.

3$Condition: Other$12/24/2013 12:16:40 AM$Reviewer: Shawna, 25-34 Female  (Patient) $1$1$1$This treatment has shown me no valuable affects for treatment of manic bi polar disorder. I feel and see no difference as if I were taking a placebo. 
4$Condition: Other$5/11/2013 9:08:29 AM$Reviewer:  (Patient) $1$1$1$"Abilify gave me hallucinations and delusions on the second day when I NEVER had them before. When I complained to my doctor and insisted I would not take it, he threw a fit! Then I learned Medicare pays $683 to the drug-maker for this poison. Apparently, my doctor needed me on this drug to pay for the mags on his Porsche. Do NOT take this poison!"
