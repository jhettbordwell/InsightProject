0$Condition: Severe Pain$3/5/2013 1:42:02 PM$Reviewer: Goodfellow, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I had clonidine put in my pain pump to help with pain and spasms.  It did no good.  I was on it for almost 2 years.  I have to have a new pain pump implanted and had to come off of the Clonidine.  When my doctor reduced the clonidine by 25 mcg's I started to notice that I was totally exhausted all the time.  I had to start drinking caffeinated coffee all day and night in order to stay awake.  Is this normal
