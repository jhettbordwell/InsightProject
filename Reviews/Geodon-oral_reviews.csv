I'm functioning very well and rarely miss out on life due to symptoms related to my bipolar anymore. 
1$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$1/27/2018 5:44:33 PM$Reviewer: ET, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$4$I started taking Geodon with lamictal and this drug combo has been like a miracle for me. I have bipolar disorder with psychosis and this drug completely stopped the paranoid thoughts and dellusions. I am currently on 40mg once at night and it is working well so far. My moods are also completely stable now. The only side effect I have is trouble swallowing which I take 25mg of benadryl with it and it relieves that side effect. Other than that, no problems.

I take 20 mg with breakfast and 80 mg with dinner. If I take too much during the day, there is a sedating effect - we had to work our way through that. Interestingly, I still have to take ambien a few times a week to sleep even with the Geodon at dinner. I have not had any significant weight gain or loss with it. It has been very effective for me, and I have been very stable while on this medication. I do have to take the Geodon and lamictal at least 2 hours apart, otherwise I have real difficulty sleeping. My doctor can't explain to me why that is, but I simply adjust my schedule if needed. I also exercise regularly, eat a good diet, and see my doctor consistently.

It caused dyskinesia so bad that I could not chew nuts or salads. I got infections and my eyes never stabilized. I had to find an independent MD to take me off and now I take  truehope vitamins.

I no longer have depression or manic episodes.
6$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$2/5/2014 10:00:28 AM$Reviewer: Noura E, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$3$5$I took Geodon for 5 years. I started at 40mg a day and increased it to 160mg a day over the course of a year. For the first few months, it was incredibly difficult. I was completely sedated and would sleep minimum 13-14 hours a day. It was near impossible for me to work let alone take care of my 2 year old son. I had to withdraw from my college courses for a semester and I would fall asleep at work. After a while I started taking it with dinner, and I would sleep through the night and although it was very difficult to wake up in the morning, I was at least able to function during the day. I was much more even temepered and it did control the severe ups and downs, but what I did not like was that my body was addicted to it (whether it was an actual physical addiction or mental addiction, I have no idea,) however, I remember it was a holiday weekend, I had run out of refills and I was awake for 3 days. I felt like I was high on drugs. I literally had an out of body experience during these days and it was difficult. It got to the point, if I didnt take the geodon I wouldn't be able to sleep. I came off of it last February (2013) and was prescribed it again yesterday. Being off of it was not easy and my life was incredibly difficult. The side effects are worth it to me, although this time I will only be using it until I'm at a therapeutic dose of lamictal and keep it between 2-40mg/day.

I took it twice, both at night and the following day was HORRIBLE. I had weird feelings in my legs and whole body. It's been about 3 days since I've last taken it and I still feel odd. I am unsure whether or not to go to the ER cause I'm having headaches, problems sleeping, sleep paralysis,  nightmares, odd feeling in chest (I start to burp and release air and it dissipates a bit) and I overall feel like this drug should not be prescribed to ANYONE. 
9$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$6/18/2013 7:00:34 PM$Reviewer: Professional with Geodon, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$2$Geodon is a great, stabilizing medication, if you are a professional and want to be productive.  Although, it is not a quick solution. You have to be patient and give it a long time to work.  It does have side effects.  This review tells how I worked around them.  I was on Geodon for my mixed, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder for over seven years.  In combination with Zoloft, it did a wonderful job of containing my up and down cycling.  I also have ADD and, with the Geodon, I was finally able to succeed at finishing my dissertation and continuing as a university professor.  It gave me back my life.  Since my body requires more medicine dosage than normal, I was on a mega dose.  I had to take a separate medicine to control the twitches, but that worked.  I am not married, but could imagine there would be much less sex drive.  Geodon stays in your system for a long time.  You have to be patient with it at first, because it takes sometimes over a month to have it built up in your system.  On the other side, it is not as touchy, if you delay a dose.  It does not make you manic right away.  And tappering off or stopping will cause delayed mania later.  It does have the effect of making people super drowsy, when taken once per day.  I had to space my four pills: 1 with breakfast, 1 with lunch, 2 with supper.  With the last dose, I had to take it with supper because then I would be really tired and ready for bed about 4-5 hrs later. With the weight gain, I tried four other medicines for my mania before I went on Geodon over the time it took me from the first med to Geodon, I gained 20lbs, but stayed at that weight for the next 7 years.  Pharmacological, the only things I had to adjust were taking a cold med that was for people with high blood pressure and being careful to eat a meal when taking it in large doses or with another stomach-bleeding medicine, like Ibuprofen. I took it successfully for over seven years, until I went through the neurochemical changes of menopause.

This medication has helped smooth out my moods but have had some serious side effects. Mostly in the form of waking up in the morning and not being able to focus my eyes and feeling very drugged and having to be driven to work by family members.

All in all the medication is working but I am struggling a bit with side effects but to me it is worth it.

No suicide thoughts, think about death all the time, not healthy, vision problems, weight gain was rapid when I 1st started Geodon. 50lbs in 4 mos. My body aches with no mercy, decaying my teeth fast, no sex drive at all. Having Bipolar is very difficult, there is no cure yet. Before I was diagnosed & got on the right med, I was violent, raging & totally out of control, hurting family & myself. This type of disorder is difficult, always changing meds, and hoping that one day you will find one that works for you.

With Zyprexa I was extremely calm, but very sedated, always tired and had gained 50lbs. With the switch to Geodon, I lost 40lbs - and I became myself again. I have a personality, unlike with Zyprexa, but I do not have bipolar symptoms. I take most of the Geodon at night and it helps me sleep. Geodon has changed my life for the better because I feel like myself again and I have been very successful in home, church and career life.

I take 400mg Topamax/day and 200mg Pristiq/day but was showing signs of anxiety and some agitation. Geodon is like a miracle. I had resigned myself to living life, sitting in front of the tv, never leaving my home. I didn't mind people coming but I never left it. I now go out occ. but not into stores yet. An occ. visit to a good fried is as good as I can get. Still on very low dose and we are increasing it monthly.

I highly rate this med because it changed me around for the better.

It was like a veil was lifted from my eyes. I could see clearly once more. I felt like a normal 21 year old young adult. I was doing fun things and not being reminded of this mood disorder that I suffer with. The unfortunate thing I learned about Geodon is it only stays in my system for about 7 hours and then I start swinging into a hypomanic/manic state again so I end up taking it 3 times a day. I don't take it in the morning other wise I will be so tired from my night dose. I am taking medications 4 times a day just to get my bipolar stable which is so frustrtaing sometimes. But The Geodon has done wonders for me and has kept me from going manic many of times.

I had been treated for depression and taking Celexa for 10+ years.  I gradually stopped the Celexa and began the Geodon.  We make jokes about being ""claratin clear"", it's literally like pealing away the levels of fuzziness and getting clearer.  Although I have been experiencing several troublesome side effects.  The worst is the swelling, I feel like my skin is stretched so tight, and diuretics don't help much at all.  I also have trouble breathing and wake up with my heart pounding in my ears.  I love that I feel like a normal person again, after so long, but the side effects are driving me nuts.  I can't find anything in the literature about swelling either - maybe this is the weight gain they were talking about."

The first few days I was sleeping non stop. When I started getting used to the effects it wouldnt put me to sleep so much. But then I could not get up in the morning to go to school, or function. I tried getting off it once cold turkey and I almost went completely insane: extreme anxiety, couldnt stop hysterical crying,depression, and insomnia, it took me about a week to get back to a somewhat normal state. My doctor kept upping the dosage since I couldnt stay asleep anymore, and in the end I was falling asleep everywhere, and now had to go to independent studies due to loss of ability to wake up and stay up. Horrible medicine. I dont want anyone else to suffer the same.

I take two 60mg capsules at night. I am ""zoned out"" and sleepy all day. I am too tired to do anything. Also, I have never been so paranoid in my life. I have many seriously irrational fears. I am scared of doing anything or going anywhere. I was not like this before Geodon. I spoke to my doctor this morning and told her I wanted to stop immediately; but, because of fear of withdrawal symptoms I must taper off the medication. It can also raise blood sugar and cause diabetes. I would not recommend this medication to anyone except, maybe, as a last resort."

The voices in her head have stopped and she is thinking clearly.  She seems to be calmer and not as ""manic"" as she has been in the last 3 weeks.  
She was diagnosed 8 years ago at age 20 and has been moderately functional for the most until early this summer.  Graduating with her second college degree, I think the stress did her in and then failed her clinical board on top of that! (low self esteem and severe depression)
She has tried a variety of meds (Concerta, Zyprexa, Lexapro, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta) combined with Abilify. 
At present she is on Celexa(20mg)/Geodon(60mg)/Topamax(25mg) in AM and Topamax(25mg) in PM.  We will continue to monitor her experiences with this med and post weekly.
Just a thank you to everyone who takes the time to review these meds.  It does help!"

Geodon is the only anti-psychotic I have taken.  I have been on a 60mg dose twice a day for 2 or 3 years now.  The only problem I have with it is weight gain. It was just a little bit at first then earlier this year out of nowhere I put on 30 pounds in a matter of 6 months.  My weight seems to be holding steady now and has been for several months.  The dosing schedule was really hard at first too cause sometimes it makes me sleepy.  I finally got it down to a science and I take one at 3AM and go back to sleep until 7AM and I take my second dose at 3:30PM.  The only thing that REALLY BOTHERS me about this miracle drug is the cost.  If I didn't have insurance, a 30-day supply would cost me a little over $1,700.00 which is NOT affordable!  It is RIDICULOUS!!!  People depend on this medication to function as a ""normal"" human being yet the drug company makes it impossible to afford it...

I was taking this on top of a number of other drugs, including 200mg of Lamical daily. I have since lowered my 80mg daily dose to 60mg and now I'm at 40mg. This medication has the same sleeping coma effects of seroquel...church bells in my room couldn't wake me up. So, needless to say I don't have the ability to have a normal job and life because this stuff just takes over any ability to wake up. Since I reduced my dose to 40 mg, I am experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms & feel like I'm crawling out of my skin....similar to Lamical withdrawal. My advice, don't start taking on top of another bi-polar med if you don't absolutely need it!

It must be carefully taken and administered for proper therapeutic use. I take it for the negative side effects of my illness and it works quickly and well. However, the startup side effects are very uncomfortable and can be nasty. I was started on 60mg at night and it knocked me out and made my manic the first 3 days. After this period it made me sleepy at night and not too manic. However after about 8 hours it would clearly begin to stop working and made me agitated. So now I am on 60mg morning and 60mg after supper. It works very strangely with food. If you eat a high fat/carbohydrate meal it can make you seem a bit lethargic so I eat high fiber (fruits and veggies) and it is milder. In all it has been a lifesaver!

I started out at 80 mg at night and was bumped up to 160 mg at night about six months ago due to a severe depressive episode.  Since then I have gained 60 lbs - about 10 lbs a month.  My cholesterol is also very high.  I have had withdrawal side effects a couple hours before my dose is due.  Have developed weird finger movements and a constant sense of restlessness.  Have also experienced leg pain.  Finally convinced my psychiatrist that geodon does indeed cause weight gain for some.  I'm in the process of weaning off now.  Am down to 120 mg a day.  Going to see how low I can go and still be stable.  Have tried other drugs but geodon works the best for my mood.  I just can't take weighing 245 lbs.

I started off on a lower dose but had to increase it about a year ago due to a breakthrough episode.  I think that it causes my sugar to be out of whack sometimes as I now have some peripheral neuropathy but I am not diabetic.  This has  been a great drug for stopping manic episodes and with the increase stopped some visual sensations that I get before an episode.  It is the first thing that I take when I get out of bed in the morning.  I was taking this with Lamictal but had to discontinue that due to a rash, but I have been fine for quite a while.  It does make you sleepy at first (I take 2 before bedtime) but that does wear off after a while if you can stick with it, it is well worth the benefit.

Once I figured out that geodon was causing me to be extremely agitated, intensely distracted, inorgasmic, hyper sensitive, then the physical stuff started!  Bloody noses, blurred vision, chronic diarhhea, severe abdominal cramping to name a few!  That was enough for me!  I'd rather go back on Lithium and be a little chubby and much, much happier than to continue to take the 5 meds I take now (geodon, lamictal, topamax, celexa & kolonopin) and feel like garbage!  So , I decided to stop the 80mg of geodon - ""cold turkey""...I DO NOT RECOMMEMND THIS TO ANYONE - EVER!  I stopped taking it 3 days ago and have been so I'll, I'm in bed 24/7!  Nasuea, vomiting, no appetite,  can't keep food or liquid in, headach, bodyache, flu like symptoms, horrible cramping - so painful that I stay in the fetal position most of the day!

I read some of the comments and today I fell not sure cuz of med or jus cuz i was clumzy. So far Today I feel really good. Better than I have in a really long time so I hope it keeps going that way.

I think I actually may have felt ""normal"" for the first time in my life! Then about 3 weeks into taking it I started getting extremely sleepy during the day - to the point of falling asleep while driving my child to school. Very dangerous. I was at the time taking 40mg in the am and 40mg in the pm. I called the doc and mine was on vacation - the doc on duty cut out my daytime dose so I was just taking the nighttime 40mg. This did not help the sleepiness for the first 2 weeks, but made me go berzerk! I started feeling depressed again, I was irritable, had the racing thoughts, the whole bit. This week the sleepiness finally went away and I saw my doc today. She upped my dosage at night to 60 mg to see if I can handle it without being sleepy during the day to try to work back up to 80mg but take it all at night, hopefully without the sleepiness during the day. I hope it works, because the drug itself was doing wonders for me - but I can't be sleeping every where I go!!"

I couldn't sleep with out this medication and when I did take the medication it put me right to sleep.  Now to the better part.  When I would wake up in the morning I wouldn't have any of these side effects, however I was my normal self.  Very unusual, to say the least.  My recommendation is to not start on the medication unless you are really in need of a change.  But if you begin and need to go off for any reason expect to be up all night and for several nights with flu symptoms and severe anxiety.  Hope you found it informative.

I have been on geodon for two months now, taking 80mg a day. much better mood control, and no racing thoughts. I feel alive again and in control. I was on abilify for two years and this doesn't make me a robot. however, I was put on depakote a few years ago which made me gain 80lbs in two months,and gave me polycystic ovaries, as well as making me prediebetic.all of which went away. but i am concerned because I have  skipped a period and seem to be gaining weight rapidly. having read that it increases prolactin in females, It makes me sad because this drug really works for me mentally, but it might not be worth the risk.

First I was put on Zyprexa 7.5mg, that worked great but I gained almost 40lbs in less than two months. Not cool since I am or should I say was really fit. I was switched to Abilify.  That did NOTHING at all.  I couldn't even tell I took anything. No change at all. So then I was put on Geodon. I was told it was good for me and would lower my cholesterol.  Not that that was an issue, but anyways. I started taking it, and became very very very very very ill.  I was throwing up all day every day. I pretty much lived off of freeze pops for over a month.  I was in and out of the hospital because of dehydration once or twice a week. Sorry to say I lost all of the weight in less than a month. I asked if it was my geodon and he said that that was not a side effect. I actually was sent to the cancer unit and tested for lukemia, hepatitus, lupus and even HIV!  Very scary but none of which I had. I finally stopped taking it because I thought since I was throwing up so much that it was not even staying in me.  Immediatly I got better. Dr. said I had to take it again.  So I did three days later after feeling wonderful. And within 2 or three hours it started again. I called my Dr again to tell him I wanted to stop taking it. He said it was a coenceodence (spelling?)and to not stop it! I waited a day or two, I was fine.  Took it again and got sick AGAIN! He still thinks I had a stomach bug. I refused to take it, and he refused to see me. My new Dr. said that it is a rare side effect but it is listed.  I'm glad someone listened!

I have bouts of restlessness during the day that only seem to be getting worse. I am also on trileptal. used to be on lithium but the side effects + weight gain were too much for me. My doc says I am having tremors inside my body. used to take Inderal with the lithium to stop from shaking. Now she gave it to me again to help with this type of ""inside tremors"". Just started today with that. Hope it helps. This stuff makes me want to jump out of my skin. But every other med of this kind make you gain weight. I have gained 60 pounds in the past 1 1/2 years due to meds. I also have spinal problems and arthritis so I cannot weigh this much and its hard for me to exercise to lose it. So I will stay on the geodon and hope the upped dosage of trileptal and the Inderal help me. "

On the morning of the second day I started having trouble talking, felt like my tongue was numb or enlarged, Had difficulty swallowing and I was experiencing spasms so bad on the left side of my face I couldn't keep my eye open. Ended up in the ER because I was having such a hard time swallowing I thought my throat was going to close off.

At first it worked wonders. For the first time in almost two months he was laughing, joking around and being himself that we all missed. I noticed a huge differnce right away and it worked. Although it made him anxious and jittery. When he was relesed from the hosptial he was doing well. That night though, he started getting really aggitated and anxious and couldn't handle anything. He kept complaning of feeling heavy, having panic attacks, confused and hazzy, ect. I took his car and drove him home. The next am at 7:30 he called and said he was feeling funny, worse then the night before and that he was having more attacks. He came over about 10am and hardly could walk up my stairs and was exausted. He kept saying he couldn't breath right. I took him home and his step dad and I took him to the ER. He was having reactions to the medication and was dehydrated. He felt better when we left and we went on with our day. Again, at dinner time he started acting the same. He went to bed real early and got up again real early. The third night he got really irritated, annoyed, panicy and anxious and kept saying he was going crazy. It was really quite scary. His mom called the the dr from the hosptial stay and said to stop taking it immidently. That was last night. Today he is still very stressed and anxious and feeling like crap. This is the 7th or so med he has tried in the last year and a half. Nothing has worked. But this has had the most noticable side effcts. I've read lots of horror stories from people who have had to take this med long term and I am so glad he is off of it after a week. It costs a fortune. He was wonderful health insurance and it cost 80bucks on top of the other expensive meds he is on. 
I do not reccomend this drug."

I've only been on Geodon for a week and I am me again! Yahoo! I am going through an ugly divorce, was forced out of my own house and had to move where I had sisters in another state. So, my depression was worse than it's ever been. To the point I had suicdal idiation and admitted myself to a psych hospital where I was for 8 days. They put me on Lithium. I couldn't function AT ALL on Lithium. Almost wrecked my car; fell asleep sitting up during family get togethers; couldn't manage my finances; I couldn't think straight. I threw the Lithium down the toilet. We all have different body chemistry, so maybe it works for some people (Lithium) but, not me. The combination of meds I am now on are really working for me. Geodon; Lexapro; & Klonipin. Now I have energy, good clarity, and I can sleep at night. I literally pop out of bed happy in the morning. Before, I couldn't get out of bed or my house and felt totally hopeless. I hope my experience helps someone else.

It feels different than anxiety symptoms. I have been on it for 6 weeks. Considering switching but all have some side effects like weight gain and severe drowsiness. I am a light weight on drowsiness. I hate to change again and miss more summer or risk paranoia.  I take it for bipolar I (affective) disorder with psychotic features. Hope that helps.

However they put me on a lower dose this time only 40mg and I remember it knocking me out before well it still does that. However I do take it at night and am kinda groggy in the morning but overall I've had good success with this meidcine so hopefully the rapid heart rate wont come back again. I welcome the sleep as I had insomnia big time for weeks at a time. I personally am satisfied with this medication. I also take Clonzapame *sp* as a mood stabilizer. So far so good.

Ihad all the major side effects from severe migraines,hot flashes,racing heart rate to even a numbness on the left side of my head.I almost gave up,but I'm glad I didn't. I have a new lease on life. I have more energy,I can get through the day without feeling worn out from manic episodes, my depression is gone, and I don't live in my own little fantasy world anymore. I quit taking seroquel so I could start geodon and now I'm losing all the weight I gained while on seroquel. I take this medicine(120mg)in conjunction with lamictal and zoloft. My only continuing side effect is a slight tremor in my left hand.

This drug made me have to go to the ER. Which I'll skip the details here but it was scary. Never having the sort of reaction I did have scared the living mess out of me. I had to go to the ER because I had my eyes rolling back in my head and I had my tongue making me look like an idiot. What fun. I hated this drug and will never take it again. When they give you this drug they hope that the benefits will out way the side effects. Losing control of your facial muscles are serious and scary side effects. I didn't see a benefit. Those that are taking this drug please just be careful and those that are considering taking this drug I can't tell you that it won't work because who knows it very well could and work out to be the best medicine for you but just please be careful. Not that anyone asked but I ended up in the ER less then 3 days of first taking it.

I am happy, lots of energy- feel like a new person.  I am afraid that it is too good to be true... can't afford eyes rolling back in head, lock jaw, inability to talk when I am alone all day and most nights with a 3 year old and 7 month old- Don't know what to do?

One thing I wanted to mention...his doctors have warned that this drug is INEFFECTIVE if not taken WITH FOOD.One psychiatrist stated that he needs to ingest at least 500 calories when he takes it. So possibly a few of the patients with reports of failure haven't taken in enough calories with their geodon.

Then I began feeling extremely anxious. At night I felt clobbered, so extremely exhausted. Then, after about a week, when I was up to 100 mg/day, I had a distemic reaction which landed me in the emergency room. After a few days off Geodon, my Dr. reintroduced it with a medication to counter the distemic reaction. At this point I am up to 40mg/day.I still feel awful and then 2 days ago I began hearing voices. Has anyone heard of this happening? Could I be having the opposite effect from the Geodon--could it be causing psychosis? I am also taking Depakote, and was on a small amount of Clonzapin but only for a week, and my Dr. was having me go off of that. 

On the day the voices started, I had only taken .25 mg of the Clonzopan. (I had been taking .5/day for most days and at the beginning of the week had taken 1mg/day for two days--I have a history of benzo abuse, so this was all a very low amount for me and I have never suffered from withdrawal from other benzos I have taken.)

My doctor thinks the hallucinations could be from Clonzapin withdrawal, but I don't see how that could be. 

I would appreciate any feedback."

I had my best day ever yesterday! If I stay calm after my dose at night I will sleep, like a log, but if I get moving(like in the a.m., I make myself go!!),I get over the hump and am fine. So if you're like me , you may need to practice deep breathing and stretches for your night dose, and some lite stretching and gentle motions for keeping going in the a.m. 1/2 caffeine coffee helps, too! This drug is tough, but I see light at the end of the tunnel! If that changes, I'll let you know. Hope this helps someone, and thank all of you for your thoughts and reviews!

It has worked very well.  My moods have completely stabilized but I don't feel numb.  I have not had many side effects except for the sleepiness which my doctor prescribed Provigil to combat.  It works very well and I am overall pretty satisfied so far.

The other 85% I was stuck with a constant sense of severe anxiety, restlessness (esp. in my shoudlers), still waking up in the middle of the night despite the tranq effects it had.  Good drug but VERY strong - be prepared to set aside a few days to get used to it.  I was just too sensitive for it.

165$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$11/2/2007 4:55:26 PM$Reviewer: $5$4$5$Lamictal, Cymbalta and Geodon. Excellent combination.  Thank Goodness I am off the Risperdal.  That was making me gain weight immensely.  The only side effect I had from Geodon is mild sleepiness and for some reason I have this taste in my mouth like I swallowed aspartame or something sweet like it. Other than that I lost 8 lbs and I am in control of the anger/mood swings. I highly recommend Geodon.

It really stabilizes me without the weight gain I experienced on Zyprexa.  I have no side effects other than a little sleepiness either from the Geodon or the Depakote or both which is easily remedied by drinking a couple cups of coffee.  This has been a wonder drug for me.  I highly recommend giving it a chance.
