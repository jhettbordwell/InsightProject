3$Condition: Aggressive Behavior$11/28/2009 5:24:35 PM$Reviewer: drinlynn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This is the ONLY medication that reduces/eliminates my severe aggitation & aggrssion. For years doctors gave me nerve pills (ex:klonopin,zanax) in addition to my other meds & kept saying what I had been feeling was anxiety. Feeling excessively aggitated & the onset of an attack is completely different than having an anxiety attack/anxious feelings. All anxiety meds do is make me sleep for hours. Finally, I can control my aggitation and live a very normal functional life. (I also take 3 depression meds daily as well as anxiety medication as needed- and I NEVER need it now!) Haloperidol is a miracle!
