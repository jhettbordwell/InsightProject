1$Condition: Depression$5/13/2019 11:21:16 PM$Reviewer: thankful, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been taking 300mg of Bupropion XL (the generic form of Wellbutrin XL) for four years and I have to say this medicine has saved my life. Before I started Bupropion, I had had five depressive episodes in four years; I have not had a depressive episode since I began taking Bupropion four years ago. I can feel happy again and I can laugh. I am able to feel sadness, but it doesn't overwhelm me. I am not drowning in self-loathing anymore. I am myself again and I have been myself for four years. As far as negative side-effects are concerned, I will have a migraine if I accidentally skipped a dose the day before. It also took a while to kick in. The first two weeks were difficult because my brain would go ""offline"" in the afternoon and I wouldn't be able to do anything until my brain ""restarted"" later in the evening. This pattern lasted for a few weeks. The first month was pretty terrible, though there were glimmers that things were changing; I would feel less awful than usual for ten minutes every few days. The second month was a little better; I was able to feel happy for an entire hour one day and could generally enjoy things more. Week nine was when I had five whole good days where I could feel happy any time I wanted all day long. Week ten was when everything took off and I started feeling like myself again. Four years later, this medication still works for me. I have been able to get back on my feet and rebuild my life after my depression because the chemicals in my brain are working for me and not against me. I feel good. I can feel good whenever I want. I'm not held captive by depression anymore. Bupropion made all of that possible."

The depression feeds into my anxiety.  I am a low starting dose.  I am concerned about my blood pressure, but it hasn't noticably risen.  Part of my issue may have been working remotely with little to no human interaction whilst my better half goes to work.  That said, I am not as anxious these days.  I even started traveling for business again and it is painless!  I feel the need to exercise somewhat regularly again!  I sweated two days in a row and actually jogged on the treadmill! I can't say that I have lost any appreciable weight, but I feel ""lighter"" in mood and actually want to do things.  I may have incorrectly attributed my depression to being an introvert and vice versa.  I do really like people even thought they (except for really good friends) drain my energy reserves."
7$Condition: Depression$2/7/2018 2:00:53 AM$Reviewer: ScreenNamePerson, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I was suicidal (didn't want to wake up, began to consider suicide, every day was arduous, couldn't eat, socializing was difficult, loss of enjoyment of anything, hopeless, etc).  Went on 150 XL and had slight improvement, after 6 weeks went up to 300 XL and more improvement, and began to be able to live a normal life and be myself again.  With the increase to 300 i noticed my ears ring (but i already had tinitis so mostly it's just a worse version of something i'm used to coping with), my mouth is often dry and now and then my lips get super chapped, and the most notable thing is that i have a slight tremor, particularly in my thumbs.  I cannot easily delicately pick up things, which makes picking at food awkward.  It's about 4 months since i first started taking Wellbutrin (i'm on the generic, btw-Medicaid woo!).  The past week the skin around my thumbs has felt kind of thick when i bend them and TODAY i am noticing a stiffness in my left thumb. None of the other side effects alarmed or excessively bothered me enough to go back to being suicidal, but this stiffness is weird, it's like i don't have full range of motion or my thumb just won't go where i want it to.  Texting tonight has been very awkward, and typing is also feeling kind of weird, so this is the first time i've felt uncomfortable about a side effect.  If it worsens I would start to consider changing it up, but that of course is an upsetting thing to have to deal with and invite that kind of chaos and darkness back into my life now that i'm finally getting on track after wasting months laying in bed.  Hope you guys are doing well.

11$Condition: Depression$4/2/2017 3:22:13 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$3$2$3$I'm currently taking 450mg. Each increase in dosage was beneficial for about a week, but then I'd hit a plateau. 450 seemed to be the right dose for about 3 weeks, but I've been on this dose for 8 weeks now and feel like the cons are starting to outweigh the pros. I'm not as focused anymore, in fact I've began to have more apathy. My depression hasn't really been helped and I have emotional panic attacks now and then, especially if I drink alcohol-which I was told was the equivalent to completely skipping a dose..makes sense. I've lost 5 lbs, and I'm not binge eating when I feel low, but now I'm obsessed with the weight loss and feel like that's equally problematic. I am less impulsive, but now I seem more obsessive than normal. I've had multiple surgeries in the past 2 years and I was developing a narcotic addiction, within 2 days of taking this medication that craving went completely away, but my ruminating thoughts are increasing again and the impulse to take a pill for no reason but to feel numb is coming back. I take this along with Lamictal, I've been on Lamictal for 3 years, but it wasn't helping with my depression that I cycle with every 6 weeks. I'm ready to get off of this medication, especially since I notice an increase of negative behavior during my menstrual cycle and I'm a week away from another one.

I was in a catatonic state of just being. I suffered dozens of panic attacks in a day. I nearly admitted myself to the hospital for my depression. I was just so tired. So complacent and ""blah"". I even had to call into work a few times due to just not being able to get up out of bed. Even getting myself up to take a shower was hard. Maybe this would help someone else, but for me and my biology, it just made everything worse."

Bupropion XL-Teva/generic, for over a year now. I have never taken the ""name brand"" as a generic was available when I began treatment. ""Teva"" has bought out ""Actavis"", another generic brand, and my last two refills of ""Actavis"" generic bupropion have not worked as well as the ""Teva"" generic and I now experience ""weird side effects"" with ""Actavis"" pills. Tried to look up ""Actavis"" pills on ""Pill identifier"" and one of the pills-the 300 mgs., cannot be found so I am going to discontinue with the generic version of this medication and ask for the name brand, as I have heard many mixed/negative reviews for the newer generic versions of this medication. I am told at the pharmacy and by doctors that generics must be bioequivalent to the ""real"" drug and may contain ""other fillers/byproducts"", however, as I have had a generic migraine medicine prescribed that did not work at all-when the ""name brand"" works like a miracle. So I will consult with doc. for ""name brand"" or go to another medication, tired of the merry-go-round of generics.    "

It caused severe shaking almost to the point of seizures. I was so hoping it would provide relief but no. I am in the process of waiting for it to clear my system before further attempts finding something that might help. Dr ordered genetic testing to determine what my body will process effective and safe. Ironically most of what I have been prescribed previously is a big NO. I had to find that out the hard way. Seems like my liver will not process these types of meds safely. I've been on many in search of relief but nothing so far has helped. At least with this test done it may enlighten Drs in the future.

When I started taking it, I was 175 lbs. I am now 257 lbs. I don't blame it on SSRIs entirely. I stopped working out and started eating less healthy. However, I believe that the SSRIs affect my ability to feel satiated by eating. I started changing to Buproprion to get off Sertraline. So far so good. I am not depressed at all any more, but I have yet to start losing weight. That's more on me and getting back into a routine of physical activity.

I do really like wellbutrin, moreso than SSRIs or SNRIs because it doesn't have quite as bad interactions with illicit drugs (If you're gonna do it at least be kinda smart about it) but mostly because it didn't have as many side effects for me, all I noticed was increased sweating for the first month which has gone away, and my appetite is poor and I lost some weight after I started it, but thats about it. Oh and it makes cigarettes taste like acetone, very effective in reducing smoking.  "

I have been on Wellbutrin XL 300mg for about 2.5 years with extremely positive results. This is the first antidepressant I have ever taken, and I have been much better on it. No more falling through emotional thin ice 20+ times a day, no more crying, and hardly any negative thinking. Started on 150xl for about 1.5-2 months then up to 300XL. 
In the first months experienced almost no side effects save for a few strange new headaches a couple days, but they quickly went away. Only side effect is constipation, which can mostly be mitigated with fiber and good eating. 

I take it in the morning and it has not affected my sleep, though I find I do sleep better and am more refreshed when I occasionally take valerian or even a melatonin/benadryl. 

Last year I felt while I was doing well, but still needed a little umpf to push ahead. Tried the 450mg xl and it was fine for a few days/ a week but proved to be too strong; I felt angry, emotional rollercoaster started again, and couldnât' focus or concentrate. Back down to 300 and all is well. Cost for brand name is outrageous. From my research decided to stay away from generics, and found a reliable pharmacy to order from for a fraction of the local pharmacy cost.
Exercise is still a must for me to feel O.K.   Not more than 2 days without of I fall back into a slump. Gym used to make me go from a -6 to maybe a 1-3.  Now I go from feeling a 3 to a 9/10 after the gym. "

I was placed on this because the weight gain I had while on celexa made me feel unhappy and unhealthy. I have been on300mg for about 2 months.

44$Condition: Depression$9/25/2014 12:01:37 PM$Reviewer: DJKLondon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I am a 47 year old male diagnosed with ADHD combined with bouts of major depression. Over the years I have tried every tricyclic, SSRI, SNRI and atypical antidepressant on the market. While I was taking Ritalin or Dexedrine I never experienced the dpression but I decided that I wanted to go medication-free for my ADHD. I question the wisdom of that decision but anyhow my doctor suggested we try Wellbutrin and I agreed. I started by taking 150mg first thing in the morning and then 300mg every morning since then. It's been about 5 months now and I can't believe the change in how I feel! Wellbutrin lifted me out of the depression right away (ie within 2 days) and it helps with the ADHD symptoms as well. Not to the same extent as the stimulants but it's enough that I can focus now and get tasks completed. I am so thankful for whoever invented bupropion. One think I noticed is that it is closely related to amphetamine and diethylpropion, both used in the past as anti-depressants/anorectics. I believe it is this similarity that gives Wellbutrin the edge over the SSRI's (which are garbage in my opinion)currently in use and I would not hesitate to recommend Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR or XL to anyone who is suffering the debilitating symptoms of depression! Two thumbs up for Wellbutrin!

47$Condition: Depression$8/31/2014 10:39:43 PM$Reviewer: surf, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$Absolutely love wellbutrin. I am 18, and I suffer from anxiety and depression. I started on 150 mg, and then a couple weeks later was upped to 300 mg. I have been on wellbutrin for about 2 months, and have not had a single depressive episode. I was really hoping this would help with my anxiety but it hasn't. Luckily it hasn't made it worse either. Very very happy on/with this drug and it also helps with my ADD! 
48$Condition: Depression$8/22/2014 9:22:43 AM$Reviewer: katred, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$"As an antidepressant, it worked wonders within the first week, as the dose was being titrated up.  I had energy and experienced needed weight loss and was very pleased, as I did not do well on SSRI or SNRIs.  Unfortunately, I was not aware that I had a low seizure threshold and by the second week, I had a 15 minute duration grand mal seizure and resulting head trauma.  Therefore, the medication had to be discontinued.  

For individuals NOT prone to seizures, I think this drug could be very useful, but I do think extreme caution should be taken when prescribing to anyone, even is there is no known history of seizure, and it is imperative that front office staff be educated on signs of impending seizure.  

I called the doctor's office to report very uncomfortable side effects that seemed to come on rather quickly (tremor, severe ringing in the ears started overnight during second week of therapy and increased dose) and was told by the receptionist that they couldn't see me that day and ""might be able to work me in the next day"", and to not stop the medication until I spoke to the doctor.  After I hung up the phone, I immediately had my seizure.  I don't know if the agitation of their lack of care brought it on, or if it would have happened at that moment anyway, but I learned to be more insistent with medical staff members after this experience.    

So, overall, a wonderful alternative to SSRI and SNRI meds, but not enough education is provided to the staff at many medical offices and a 'warning sign checklist' needs to be in the patient file whenever this medication is prescribed."

50$Condition: Depression$8/3/2014 6:36:12 PM$Reviewer: LarryV, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been using Wellbutrin XL 300mg for about 5 years. Prior to it, I was using SSRI type antidepressants. I would recommend anyone with mild depression, which what I have, to try this  first. All the SSRI types caused me to gain weight, feel drowsy during the day, low energy and killed my libido.  Or it did mine. Ladies, if your husband has lost interest in sex while on SSRI's, it is not you. It is the drug. And I would still have bouts with depression. The Wellbutrin XL has none of the above side effects. It's almost the reverse and worked just as good for me as all the newest SSRI meds. Getting off SSRI's can be tough. They have some known withdrawal symptoms. A quick search of those can be found online. I felt like electrical charges were going through my brain and saw flashes of lights. Once that was over and I got on the Wellbutrin, I felt so energized. My libido came back and was higher than before the SSRI's!! I lost 30 pounds too. I tell everyone to try Wellbutrin first. I don't know why doctors don't recommend this medication. My psychiatrist never mentioned Wellbutrin to me. Started me right off with the SSRI's. I did my own research to find them, as I knew I had to get off the others.

The first day I felt the way I imagine people do when the abuse ADHD meds, very productive and energetic.  After a couple of days my body normalized and I feel it has changed my life. Since taking it I am able to complete multiple tasks in a day, where before I would be exhausted after one. My social life perked up considerably, and graduate school is not the constant source of stress that undergrad was- and I am working full time!

I also have ADHD, and I feel like it helps me a little. I am  much more inattentive type, and I am able to maintain attention a little more than before, but it is still a struggle. This med was only prescribed for the depression."

What a nightmare! It gave me extreme rage-filled episodes everyday and got worse if I was late taking it by only an hour. It also did nothing to treat the depression and anxiety that I was prescribed it for, if anything it made it worse. I could not eat a portion size of anything during the time that I was taking it either: I would only eat a decent sized meal once a week. After about a month I was back on the Celexa which still works like a charm (albeit one that makes you gain a lot of weight).

Started taking it for these pains/shortness of breath and what the doc believed was a panic attack. I also felt jittery and my limbs felt weak.  I was always tired.  Now, I don't know what to think.  At first, I was dead tired but couldn't sleep on this stuff.  I was sleep deprived. I also seemed even sadder than before.  I'm still dead tired and have been sleeping but I feel shaky and my muscles are twitchy as well.  I don't know if this drug hasn't kicked in yet or it's time to try something else.  I also noticed, I went to work out the other day, was lifting weights, and that shakiness and muscle weakness really kicked in.  Anyone else have these issues on Wellbutrin?

I have been taking Prozac for 2 years and it helps but didn't quite get me to feeling good most of the time (just less bad than I was). Adding Wellbutrin (you can take both) has made all the difference. And it has really helped me focus on work. Prior to Wellbutrin I would start to work and then get quickly bored or distracted and do something else. I had a hard time just getting something started. Wellbutrin has made a very big change in this area. I still get distracted a little but not as much. I may ask to try 300mg when I go see my Dr. But I'm much better off than I was. I didn't even know that I had ADD symptoms, but now I think that's probably what I have had. I am so much happier. Only side effect I notice is that I seem to sleep harder. But that's not a bad thing.

73$Condition: Depression$3/7/2014 2:53:18 PM$Reviewer: drummer, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$1$5$wellbutrin does not have the anti-orgasm effect that Lexapro has on me. That's why i switched from lexapro to it. But, Wellbutrin causes me to have contstipation. The constipation caused me to have severe diareha when I used dolcolax which landed me in the ER. And during that stay I was diagnosed with ischemic colitis, which may be caused by as many as 20 things or more, but in my case is likely due to meds. Long story short I'm quitting wellbutrin and looking for an alternative.

I was really surprised how stable I felt emotionally within days of beginning treatment. I feel more focused, motivated and calm. My contant crying episodes have stopped completely. I am able to get up each morning with a positive outlook. I began cleaning, exercising, reading, meeting up with friends and properly caring for my daughter again. I have had no ill side effects except that I am hungry all the time and need to watch what I eat (holy sugar cravings!). The only aspect of my depression I am still struggling with is obsessive thinking, but I began cognitive behavioral therapy to address this. Overall, I am happy with this medication so far.

So I roughed out a year without anything until I gave in and went on this. So far so good. Three weeks and down five pounds. I still cry easily but with a new job that hopefully isn't a cesspool of asses and a wonderfully supportive husband I'm getting through. Just went up to 300 today so maybe I won't cry when my boss is evil anymore. 
76$Condition: Depression$1/23/2014 2:52:31 PM$Reviewer: happycamper, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been taking the generic form of Welbutrin (300 mg/day)for the past 3 years for chronic, low-level depression.  It has really helped me be more positive, less anxious, and more focused at work. On rare occasion, when under unusual stress, I take 10 mg of Xanax (in addition to Welbutrin) to help combat my anxiety.  I took Prozac for two years prior to starting on Welbutrin, but it just made me feel emotionally numb and finally stopped working altogether. I have had no adverse side-effects from Welbutrin and have lost the extra weight I gained while on Prozac.  It has not increased my sex-drive (unlike some other reviewers); however, it hasn't diminished it either.  I would highly recommend this drug to anyone suffering from low-level depression; although, I know everyone reacts differently.  My 18-yr-old daughter, who has ADD (inattentive type), was recently diagnosed with depression as well.  She just started taking Wellbutrin this past week (75 mg/day initially, increasing to 150 mg/day next week).  Hopefully, it will help her as much as it has helped me. (She also takes Concerta and Focalin for her ADD).

I was almost ready to give up but then gave Wellbutrin a try.  The adjustment period was hardly noticeable.  I did have a few nights of restlessness and some night sweats in the first two weeks.  The only major side effect was a major increase in sex drive.  I already had a  high sex drive but this was ridiculous!  Just having thoughts of making love to my spouse brought me to the point of orgasm, while at work!  For a few days, I was going nuts with sexual desire.  Eventually, this side effect ended by the start of week three.  Now, after two months, I'm feeling much more calm and in control of my emotions.  Thoughts of suicide continued in the first few weeks.  Now, after a couple of months, those feelings are gone too.  I also no longer have any desire to smoke and other habitual desires are also gone.  My stuttering, and fast speech and anxiety are also more in control.  Overall, this is my miracle drug.  Can't say it will be the same for you, but for me, life is now grand and improving.

80$Condition: Depression$1/16/2014 12:08:01 PM$Reviewer: Katherine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I initially started Wellbutrin at 300 mg/day (150 mg twice per day) in 2005 along with Celexa at 20 mg due to depression and anxiety. I eventually stopped taking Wellbutrin when my Celexa dose was increased to 60 mg which appeared to be the right dose/medication for me. I was recently reduced to 40 mg of Celexa due to new studies that no more than 40 mg should be taken due to risk of heart issues/death. I am now back on Wellbutrin at 300 mg/day due to the decreased dosage of Celexa. Wellbutrin has worked for me. Side effects included decreased appetite, a little weight loss initially and dry mouth. I am a smoker and I thought Wellbutrin might help with that too, however, I did not notice any decrease in cigarette cravings while on Wellbutrin. The only thing I STRONGLY caution is do not EVER take more than your prescribed amount of Wellbutrin. I overdosed by accident (took 600 mg in one day) about 2 years after I started taking it, it was the worst experience of my life. Hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia....I literally thought I was dead and everyone around me was a ghost. I ended up going to the ER because of it (I actually thought my dead body was at the hospital and I wanted to go there to wake myself up). NEVER, EVER overdose on this medication. You will be sorry! But again, taken as prescribed, I am pleased with it. 
81$Condition: Depression$1/11/2014 10:49:51 AM$Reviewer: RxLisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been taking Wellbutrin XL 300 mg for about 5 weeks now (started on 150 mg).  This has been much more effective than any other antidepressant I've taken.  In the past 20 years I've been on Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft (with and without Abilify) and also Deplin.  The first couple of weeks, I was a bit more irritable, but was ok with it, because I cared about things again and was engaging again in life.  I was mostly irritated at how I had let everything go because I just didn't care or have the energy to do anything.  In the last couple of weeks, I have developed neck pain, headaches, and intermittently blurry vision, which all are listed possible side effects.  It's working so well for my depression at this point that I'm willing to wait a couple of months to see if the side effects go away.  I'm not sure if I've lost weight, but I'm cooking more often and eating less.  With all the other meds I've tried, it was the other way around.  All medications have side effects, these, for me are tolerable to be able to enjoy my young children and actually enjoy life again.  Before Wellbutrin, I was just kind of dragging myself through life.  I've had depression pretty much my entire adult life and tried it with and without antidepressants.  So far, With Wellbutrin XL, I feel like myself again for the first time in a very long time.

97$Condition: Depression$11/3/2013 6:48:41 PM$Reviewer: wink, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was on Celexa 40 mg and felt great however being on this med I did gain some weight.  Co-workers suggest Wellbutrin and had weight loss effects and were very satisfied.  Thought I would try it.  I weaned off Celexa and started Wellbutrin 150 for two weeks but no satisfaction.  Increased to 300 by PCP and thought all was well.  One night about 9 I noticed I started itching at my ankle.  In an hour I had itchiness on legs and by 10 hives and welts on inner thights, backside, back of legs.  Lay awake until 3 am itching then noted hives and welts on abdomen, chest, underarms, under breasts and sides.  Became worried for spreading to my face or even tongue.  I drove to ER at hospital and treated with Benedryl and Prednisone immediately. 4 days later and I lost movement in my right thumb and hand very painful.  Went to ortho who have me injection and told me it was results from inflammationof the drug.  Today my hands are swollen and hurt badly and I am told it takes time to go thru system.  I am so dreadfully sorry that I switched medications and then again thank God for allowing me to live.  Never thought I would ever have a reaction and I guess time will heal.  I would rather be happy and healthy and perhaps a few pounds over weight than go thru what I have in the past week.

I started off with 150mg then after about a month they put me on 300mg along with zoloft because the wellbutrin alone wasn't helping (I will admit I did not have sexual dysfunction and it curved my appetite) After being on it for about two weeks I ended up having a seizure at work. Today marks a week since that happened and I had another one tonight. Please please please be careful with this drug. Look at the good and the bad reviews. I am not taking this medicine anymore because of what happened. I'm even terrified to drive in case I have another seizure.

I told her this morning, via email, I have had two nights with terrible sleep, waking up several times and feeling very awake! She told me if I can handle it try 2 more days otherwise stop taking it altogether. She didn't prescribe me a sleep aid. I can't believe some of the stories I hear on this about doctors.

Suddenly grocery shopping or pumping gas is no big deal again. I'm able to think more clearly at work. I'm actually planning a vacation which, one month ago and for the past few years, would have seemed like climbing Mount Everest.  I'm just back to being me.  No better, no worse.

I stopped taking the other antidepressants and continued, but then couldn't afford the brand and started the generic. Awful; dry mouth, anger, sleeplessness, mood swings, and stomach aches; I feared long term effects and so I quit taking Celexa and bupropion over two weeks. It was truly horrible; crawly skin, agitation, depression, anger, disorientation and nausea. I lived in a bathtub for two days to calm my skin symptoms and calm my nerves. Six years later I still experience these same symptoms, although not as pronounced. I don't feel my brain/body is the same and I'm staying away from drugs now. Healthy diet, exercise and cognitive therapy as opposed to ""take the pill"". Being open with my friends and confessing feelings often helps. I still wake regularly agitated and upset/angry over something that is nothing later on when I'm rested and awake--so agitated I could be awake all night. I wouldn't do it again; I'd take care of health by going to a spa and getting verbal/understanding/relational therapy. Finding a decent counsellor is difficult, but persist. A mentor, a priest, a mature relative--these people can give a 'reality picture' or feedback so you can get grounded over time. It's not just understanding yourself; it's finding a real relationship that can go deeper than becoming a good social character. Someone to confide your soul with...don't stop looking but use your discrimination and don't just confide in anyone. Really know and watch the actions of this person for character and their own self-understanding. If you are really looking sincerely, someone will appear and not necessarily cost you $100. an hour. For me, it was a woman in my church. Good luck to you...

As soon as I started the increased dose, all the side effects came on. I went from being depressed sometimes to being constantly down. Sometimes I was unable to get out of bed and do the basic everyday things. I started having hallucinations, feeling disoriented and having blackouts. I used to be very active and worked out 5 days a week. I gained 20 lbs while I was on it. The more I excercise and watched my diet, the more weight I gained. My doctor insisted that I may have had a previous underlying condition not related to the drugs. She also said she would consult a neurologist on my behalf. While I waited for her feedback, I did some research online and saw that my symptoms may be seizures (which I never had before taking the drugs). She told me that the neurologist suggested I stopped the meds as it appears I was having seizures. Within 2 weeks after I stopped taking them, the symptoms stopped. Ironic that I may have ended up taking anti-seizure meds to fix the side effects of another drug that was supposed to help me. My doctor still insists that this is the best out there at this time. Would love to try the name brand but my insurance only covers generic at the co-pay price. If I want the original, I will have to pay almost $1000 per month which I cannot afford. "

I am ok with that.

My Dr. tried many antidepressants, Zoloft, Effexor, and some I cannot remember.  Effexor caused some improvement, but in the end I was almost hyper.  We tried Wellbutrin, I think this was in the mid-late 90's and I have never looked back.  I do not obsess on the negative, cry impulsively, or think suicidal thoughts.  I am 100% pleased, have had NO side effects.  Well, the one side effect was positive, I stopped smoking w ease, they started tasting zoo BAD!!!  I later went through the slow and sad death of my husband in 2010 and did not react overly as I most certainly would have.  I have nothing but good things to say about Wellbutrin!

My appetite decreased ,I had more energy sound good but the really bad side is. I experienced a title wave of emotions.I became so so angry and ruminated over all wrongs that had happened to me , my grief was raw, a new doctor put me on 5mg lexapro and cut the Wellbutrin in half, just started and will post my results. I suffer from mild to moderate anxiety and had several deaths in my family. Bottom line start low go slow and listen to others around you if they tell you you are different.

My depression got worst and I started to have some severe side effects including hallucinations, paranoia and disorientation. I stopped taking it after I noticed that 3 days in a row I could not get out of bed. I felt like I was unable to control my movements. I could not use any of my motor skills and it felt like something heavy was holding me down. My doctor reported my symptoms to a neurologist who suggested that I may have been having seizures. Now I'm getting ready for an appointment to see the neurologist for an official diagnosis. I'm not sure if the name brand itself would have brought on the same results but I've been hearing too many negative feedback about the generic versions. Also not very pleased with my insurance for insisting that I take generic. The told me that if I want the name brand my copay would be about $300 for a 30 day supply (generic is only $15 for a 30 day supply). My doctor switched me to another newer brand which I am slowly adjusting to. So far the new meds allow me to sleep so I'm catching up on all that I missed while I was no the generic Welbutrin XL 300mg.

Some people seem to be under the impression that its a stimulant but no way (I am actually on add meds so I know the difference): just wait until you've been on it for a full month, then you'll see! You'll see that it's like any other antidepressant in that it turns you into an apathetic zombie only you'll be way less choosy and you'll eat anything in sight.  I also found that this stuff DID NOT help my ADD in ANY way, but then again I actually have add for reals and am not just self-diagnosing myself.  I believe this could help calm hyperactivity though, so maybe it's good ADHD.

I have been on it for 12 years. I originally took 150mg once a day; moved up to twice a day but switched to 300mg slow release so I wouldn't forget to take one of the doses. I tried so many different drugs over the past 20 years that I've lost count and the side affects were often horrific. Once my psychologist recommended Wellbutrin and my psychiatrist concurred I have never switched and it is the only anti-depressant I take. I also dropped 20 lbs of the 30 the other drugs had caused me to gain. It has helped with ADD, SAD and the all encompassing symptoms of depression. There have been a few times during the years when I was unable to take it for several days in a row and you could tell but just one dose and I was back up feeling great. I'm sorry it doesn't work for everyone; it has so few uncomfortable side affects when compared to some of the newer drugs. But for those who have found relief I can tell you that after all these years I still have found relief. (My husband calls them my happy pills!)

Foggy head, slow thought process, disinterest in sexual relations, minimal positive effects. I am quitting smoking and may be Bipolar so we tried Wellbutrin XL, 150mg. Severely decreases my interest in cigarettes/nicotine. Does not affect my thought processes [after the first week or two], my intimate life, or my sleep [provided i take it in the morning]. I do seem to drop things more often, but that declines as time goes on. I feel normal. It's the perfect medication for me. I recommend discussing it with your doctor to anyone with more than one issue potentially going on, that focuses more on depression than anxiety attacks. [in my case, smoking, depression, potential bipolar, probably ADD]

Best thing I ever did! I researched it on-line and found the ratio of people praising it to hating it was much more favourable than most other anti-depressants. Problem: I'm in the UK and it is only licensed for giving up smoking. So I have to order it from Europe or USA. I started by taking just a quarter of one 150mg tab and working up to the full dose by day 7. (different for everyone of course)

Doing it this way made it much easier on the side-effects which for me were itchy rash on my hand and foot and difficulty getting to sleep maybe a bit of nausea but I found if I  ate some food with them it helped -even though my research said it shouldn't affect. I have read that taking a quarter of a tablet and building up gradually to lessen side-effects doesn't work. It really does for me. Bupropion has made me feel completely ""normal"" I didn't feel like I was on medication at all, until recently. After about a year and half I found I got occasional head pains. Not a headache as such. If I lay down on my front suddenly to watch television or something like that i would get a sharp pressure-like pain. I would keep still or slowly sit up and it would pass. after a few months I gradually started to get a slight hang-over feeling for a few hours most days. without any changes to my diet etc. I don't normally get headaches. My delivery was very delayed recently and I literally ran out. I was very worried what would happen with suddenly stopping (i could not get any from the doctor of course) Nothing happened so I stayed off them for two months. I can now very slightly feel anxiety on waking up that I used to get but only slightly so I decided to start again rather than wait until it gets bad. Today is the first day and I have a bit of that slight tightness in the head feeling. Anyone else had similar?"

My sadness and crying did go away but I am going to ask for something else b/c of the jitters, heart racing, and insomnia.

I originally started on Wellbutrin XL after participating in a double blind drug study for depression.  Wellbutrin combined with Cymbalta was the study administrator's best guess as to what I had been taking. This is not a usual drug combination, but it has done wonders for me. I am able to hold down a full time job in an extremely detailed position.  I'm known at work for my calmness! "

I am just now seeing a difference. As each individual is different so do I believe how long or how soon it takes for antidepressant to kick in. I did experience some "" sudden anger"" moments but those too are starting to go away. I had been on Prozac for many years and it was not working anymore so doc prescribed wellbutrin. I think the transision between the two drugs is what caused some of my uneasy feelings but is better now. My advice is, give the drug time to get in your system before dismissing it. As stated everyone is different and it may just take longer for some to feel the effectiveness . It's helped me so far and anticipate it getting better everyday."

The problem I'm having now is, instead of lack of sex drive I'm like a 16 year old again (but I last just as long as well). I don't know if switching to this medication has brought life back into certain parts of my body that i had forgotten about (doubtful) or the medication is making me SUPER sensitive. Either way, I don't like it. Also, I get agitated fast and I'm slightly more emotional. Looking for alternative medication... any suggestions?? Anyone?

I took all kinds of meds to get rid of pain but did not help it. Later in the evening I could not take the itching and chest pain anymore and went to ER. They gave me steroids and benadryl IV and kept me overnight for the chest pains. Got better, went home next day and woke up following morning with my face and eyes swollen shut, fingers and hands were swollen and throat was shutting off, couldn't swallow and hard to breathe, so I went back to ER to get more steroids and Benadryl, still itchy. Finally went away later that night. What an experience!!! I will never take Welllbutrin again. One good thing about Wellbutrin it did take my appetite away. I am going to miss that part of it.

I was miserable, nervous, angry, sad, never satisfied. Did nothing for the low sex drive. Demanded to be taken off after a month. 6 months later I am still hearing tidbits of what I was like when I was on Wellbutrin, in fact I can say I was almost fired by my employer because of certain things I spewed out of my mouth without regard to anyone's feelings.

It made my husband happy, but being that I couldn't get enough I went outside the marriage to be satisfied. It almost seemed to put me in a bipolar state. It never happened before and it never happened since. Keep in mind I am not blaming this all on the drug because I was feeling like i wasn't getting enough attention at home and these other men provided that for me. It just seems an odd coincidence that this all started 4 weeks after i was put on wellbutrin. No problems since i got off the medication.

At first it was just anxiety, but as the years have gone by I developed severe depression on top of it. I've tried just about every kind of ""depression"" medication on the planet, and Wellbutrin (the generic, Buproprion) has been the one that's helped me the most. The depression has gotten 90% better during the time I've been taking it. Still have anxiety issues (but I've got Xanax for that...LOL)...but I'd rather be anxious than depressed any day.
I have to take this medication in the morning, otherwise it's hard to get to sleep at night. And I'm carrying around several extra pounds, but I think that all depression meds make you gain weight. 

After reading some of these reviews, it's obvious that everyone reacts differently to this medication as far as ""side effects"" are concerned. For the first week after I started taking it, side effects were a little rough...my hands shook really bad at times, I had a hard time sleeping, and I was a little nauseated. After my body adjusted to it (and it takes about a week) the symptoms subsided & everything was fine.

On the plus side ~ after I'd been taking Wellbutrin for about 6 months, I quit smoking. One of the nice little side effects of this medication. ; )

If you have depression and haven't tried Wellbutrin yet, give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.

I was prescribed this as well as other antidepresants for over a year now. I feel much better than before I started taking them. I am under a very large amount of stress most of the time and the MD and my Phych doctor recommend that I stay on 300 mg a day, once in the morning and once at night. I also take 150mg of Venlafaxine HCL er plus 1 mg of Alprozolam. And yes you do lose your sex drive. Which almost all of the antidepressants do. Overall I do benefit from the drug. Also does effect my short term memory.

For those of you who have benefited from it, I am truly happy. Unfortunately, I did not. I have never experienced a med with so many and so intense side effects. The first couple of weeks were actually OK, but once it built up in my system I experienced severe headaches, dizziness, ear ringing, nausea, night sweats, insomnia, and nightmares. The drug also caused my system to violently reject ANY other central nervous system drug I put in my body. Couldn't have a drink, a cup of coffee, or even take an ibuprofen without feeling just awful. So I stopped. That was 2 years ago. Not the end of the story, however. Every 2 months or so I get what I call ""flashbacks"" where I have episodes of the exact same symptoms that last about 3 days. This stuff tried to take my body over and it still doesn't want to let go. I curse the day I took it."

After a divorce, losing both parents (within 7 months) and the recent loss of both my dogs, Wellbutrin just doesn't seem to be effective anymore. My doc tried adding different medications along with it, but weird side effects (from the newer additions) have kept me on Wellbutrin.

Now I do have the dry mouth, strange taste in the mouth, but thatâs all taken care of with a piece of gum.So are these considered uncomfortable, I dont know.

I could not get a good breath in- it was tight and no matter how hard I tried, it would take 5 or 6 deep breaths/yawns before I got one breath, then the process would start over. I had chest pain/tightness and an incredibly fast heartbeat. I exercise regularly and am only 24, so this was unusual. I ended up in the ER because my chest hurt so bad I worried I was damaging my heart. They couldn't find anything and wouldn't believe my generic accusation, until a social worker called a psychiatrist who confirmed my symptoms as a common side effect from this generic. I took Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression 8 years ago, and I was fine. I know my body has changed, but I believe this generic may be dangerous for some. With coupons, my co-pay will be $230... so now I will be either fighting or beginning again the struggle to find an adequate medication."

My doctor thought perhaps it would help with my obsessive/compulsive behavior.  It did not do anything for that.  I guess it helped with depression somewhat.  The problem arose when I noticed any time I'd lie down, whatever thought was in my head would vaporize.  Trying to remember exactly what I'd been thinking would not get it back to save my soul.  Sometimes, I would write down my thoughts, then lie down just to see if they'd go poof (they would)---at least I could read about what was on my mind just minutes before.  However, even reading the subject would not return the thoughts themselves.  When I brought this up to my doctor, he said, ""Uh-oh.""  Apparently, I was suffering seizures on Wellbutrin, which caused my mind to reset to 0.  I was immediately taken off this drug and another was tried--and another--whichever had the best sales pitch.  I ultimately did find an extended-release antidepressant that works perfectly for my particular needs.  "

According to one article, it's the patented membrane that allows for extended release that seems to be the problem. Apparently some generics don't use the same XR method, which can lead to a huge release of the active ingredient followed by little to no release. Wellbutrin has a membrane-like wall that allows a constant release, but many generics use pills that just dissolve slowly. Other bodily functions can speed up or slow down the release (i.e., amount of food in stomach). Just thought this was interesting so I'm passing it along and will also ask my doctor about it.  http://www.prevention.com/health/health/healthy-l iving/find-out-how-to-use-generic-drugs-safely/ar ticle/ca929d93636d6110VgnVCM10000013281eac____

I've always been lucky in life and have had a great family and basically everything a child could ask for. Although, I've had some tramatic experences in my childhood my parents where in the process of getting a divorce, my father committed sucide when i was nine, and i had to move 3 years later due to expensive living in New York. After i moved  to the south it was a major culture shock and sunk into a depression. I was always a bigger taller girl which affected my self esteem, when i was 13 i weighted around 135 lbs and was 5'4. Over two years i gained 60 lbs and 3 cup sizes and am now 5'7, thankfully i still had a shaply hourglass proportion. Finally when i was around 195 lbs. i was severly depressed and though ""how did this happen"" and ""why did i let myself go"" Everyone said you look fine your a beautiful girl. Thankfully not to toot my own horne, but i am an attractive girl and look very mature for my age but that didn't matter i felt horrible. In 09 my doctor prescribed me Prozac 20 mg and i didn't like the though of being on medicine so i didn't take it reguarly  which is bad. It made my tired and it just did not work. My doctor was a prozac pusher lol. To make a long story short in October 2010 i wanted another advise and saw another doctor and he put me on WELLBUTRIN XL 150 Mg later uped me to 300mg. I though wow thats so much medicine compared to 20mg but he explained to me how it works differently and it has different mg and 150 isn't so much. 4 Months later now Feb 2011 i feel great and have lost 45 lbs in 3 months. The medicine isn't  a miracle drug or a weight loss drug. It just helps you feel like yourself, actually i felt like i wasn't on meds. It helps motivate you to help yourself and get back on track and boosts energy.

311$Condition: Depression$1/22/2011 12:05:52 PM$Reviewer: DonnaD, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I had depression because of several difficult events taking place in my life, in my job, illness in the family, etc., crying occasionally, feelings of hopelessness, like I didn't want to go on with the events and was angry at the world for what I was going through. That's all changed now. I am very happy with the effects. I started at 150 mg for about 2 weeks and didn't feel much... then started on 300 mg once a day and voila, I felt a strong difference in my mood, no more nagging negative thoughts, increased ability to not only handle the stress, but become a strong leader in my family and help others develop a more positive attitude and perspective. I recommend this drug, but like everyone else says, hopefully not as a permanent way to deal with life. Once some of the challenges I am going through have been resolved, I plan to slowly taper off of this drug altogether. It is the ONLY drug that I take.

Basically it causes sexual side effects and fatigue and does little else for my mental or emotional state. A fairly safe drug side effect wise I guess but I am still massively depressed. ANyone know of a drug to stop the ANTS and NOT cause weight gain? Been on this drug for about 3 years. Not really loving it.

I used this one and I was able to do the things that I needed.  I need it to focus and stay on task.  It also gives me a bit of energy.  It does come with its side effects just like the rest and you will have to determine is it worth it in the end for you.  In my case the benefits out weigh the effects.  I have dry mouth and headaches and some tension at times, but most of the time I am mellow.  This is very important to me as I hate high strung people even my self when I can't control my racing thoughts and brain fog.  It is a great drug in my opinion.

I've been very satisfied with the results. My mood has improved and I feel like I have a lot more energy. Prior to starting the medication, I was having trouble getting motivated to do just about everything, and I've found that it's been a lot easier to get myself to do things (e.g. washing the dishes) than it was before. As far as side effects, I experienced some insomnia for the first few days, but that was completely gone within a week. I didn't experience any other adverse side effects.

I cannot say that this was directly related to withdrawal. My Dr. could not find any reason for these symptons. I went back on my meds after that, because of personal problems as well, and they seem to work better now, I think I was getting used to the dosage... overall it seems to work well, I do still get irritable which could be beause I don't take my 1st dose right away when I wake up, and I forget or have to skip my second dose because it is too late in the day to take it..

All I wanted to do before taking this was sleep, and when I was up I was grouchy and irritated. I actually like getting up in the morning and enjoy my day. Everyone around me is much happier as well. I tried Cymbalta first and it didn't fit my specific needs, and in fact worsened my depression. There are different medicines for different types of depression. Wellbutrin works on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is for motivation and acivating the reward center in the brain. I wouldn't discourage or encourage the use of this drug. It's your doctors job, depending on your depression symptoms, to match you with the best medicine for you. You need not listen to people that say not to try it, everyone is different. This medicine may or may not work for you. Treating depression is not an exact science, due to our lack of knowledge about the brain. Finding the right depression medicine will take trial and error, which can be very frustrating. Stick with it and you will find a medicine that works for you.

General Dysthymia & Sleeping Problems

Pros:
The increased energy levels and motivation have really helped.  The initial euphoric/hyper feelings dissipate quickly but are still enjoyable for the first few days.  Bad thoughts and anxiety tend to pass much more quickly.  Bad moods and sadness are not nearly as ""low"" as they were before.  It makes it much more easy to combat problems instead of dwelling on them.  Improved sleep seems to be a result of the other effects.

Cons:
Constipation is sometimes a problem, but this can be dealt with through proper diet.
I also get more thirsty throughout the day.

Neutral:
Really reduces hunger pangs and overall appetite.  This has been very helpful for losing the weight put on while depressed.  It may not be good for those who are already lean."

373$Condition: Depression$8/9/2010 12:02:20 AM$Reviewer: singingmama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$After suffering from PTSD from my husband committing suicide, then a few months later being gang raped and beaten , I understandably was severely depressed. I kept thinking of ways to kill myself, my son, and my unborn child. It was crazy, I couldn't go anywhere or function at all. So my doctor put me on this and after a few months added Celexa and it worked miracles. I was able to go back to college to finish my degree and both of my sons have a mother who is totally functional. The only side effect I noticed was appetite suppressant and since I am very overweight I think it's a great one to have! I no longer binge everynight!

It works great. The pharmacist has several manufacturers he can go to for the one that works better for the patient so I would try different generics until I found a suitable one. I also take 225 mg. of Effexor XR along with the Wellbutrin and Buspirone (generic Buspar). I recently switched my Effexor to generic and it is working great. I guess because I have been on them so long, I do not have any adverse effects.My doctor is switching my Buspar to Xanax because the Buspar has affected my vision and I am experiencing involuntary muscle contractions and jerking movements. I tried Cymbalta once before and I felt suicidal so back to the Wellbutrin for me.

The insomnia abated after about 3 weeks of treatment and I take a fiber supplement to deal with the constipation. It also abates with time but never completely goes away. Another side effect at firt was a general ""hyper"" feeling but that also wore off after a few weeks. Unlike the SSRIs, Wellbutrin does not make me feel ""druggedâ - I feel emotions, good and bad - but the difference I notice while taking the drug is that I tend not to brood or obsess over negative events or ideas, it is easier to let them pass. I think it has also made me more able to open up to talking about my situation because I donât think I have to reign in my âbadâ emotions so tightly as I donât fear them getting out of control. It is easier to work through them, and talk about them. Wellbutrin by itself is a great help, but by far the most effective treatment for me has been talk therapy. Depression runs in the family. I did not start seeking treatment until age 27 when it became overwhelming  and was affecting my work and relationships. The first course of treatment my physician prescribed were SSRIs (Paxil, Prozac and Zoloft), but I could not tolerate the side effects nausea and drowsiness, but the worst, that although my depression was dampened, so were all my emotions. These side effects never abated. I became even more distant from people I loved and could not function effectively at work because it was difficult to concentrate. I had great doubts about all of the anti-depressants after those experiences, and am skeptical of drug claims and the pharmaceutical industry in general but have to admit that Wellbutrin has been very effective. I know that SSRIs are very effective for many  people - I just wanted to share that portion of my experience because I believed that because they did not work for me, nothing would. I am glad to be proven wrong."

I really like the fact that I don't feel like I need to sleep all the time which I did when I was on Celexa. I also like the way it helps boost my mood and has definitely helped with my sex drive that had been non-existent with Celexa. However, I am waiting for some of the side effects to wear off. My doctor said to give it a few more weeks before I decide if I like it or not. From day two I have been dizzy. It is better now than it was, but still feeling it. I also have been very nauseas and I have had a mild headache, kinda feels like a sinus headache. I also have had hot flashes and night sweats and my ADHD is actually worse. I find that odd since this drug can also be taken for ADHD. 
If the side effects fade I am all for this medicine, but if they don't there is no way I can keep taking it. I have also had some trouble sleeping, but as long as I take at least half of my dose of Neuratin and Buspar a few hours before bed I am fine. If I forget to take it early I can't take it at all because I need 12 hours before getting up to get those two out of my system or I can't find it hard to wake up on time. I'm gonna give it one more week and if the side effects don't fade it is back to the doc for our next trial and error run."

I was diagnosed with Major Depression 5 years ago and initially was prescribed Celexa. I felt a little better but still had no concentration or energy. My psychiatrist added Wellbutrin XL and it turned out to be the answer I needed. I would not have survived my depression without the addition of Wellbutrin to my celexa (300mg Wellbutrin and 40 mg Celexa). I know some people have shared negative side effects of this drug but you will not know unless you try it. It worked well for me but it is not for everyone. If you have depression please do not give up on finding the right medication for you. It just takes some time.

Previously I was taking prozac for about 4 months which helped my mood but left me feeling so tired and lethargic; therefore I switched.  Now I'm taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg (for one week)  and still have only felt little relief.  The worst side effect for me is abdominal pain.  Day 2 of taking the new dose I started feeling bad stomach pain.  Still has not got better but I'm trying to wait it out to see if it will help my mood.
423$Condition: Depression$4/23/2010 8:09:54 PM$Reviewer: ThereIsASolution, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was on SRI's for 13 years, and was exhausted all the time, barely functioning, even though the dark depression was gone. I slowly switched from Effexor to Wellbutrin, I take 400mg in the morning now, then added Xanax .25 at night for anxiety. The effect was startling - in a few days, I hate much more energy and motivation. I used to have to take naps at work at lunchtime because I felt like I was going to almost faint - at least 2-3 times a week. I have done that for 10 minutes once in 2 years. I was able to do 5 years of taxes that I was too tired to tackle before, and I can function much better in general now. Made a huge difference in my life, night and day. Wellbutrin affects dopamine levels much more than most of the SSRI's, I believe that's the reason. I am a recovering alcoholic (26 years sober), and drinking affects dopamine too, so I can see why Wellbutrin works for me.

Started at 150 for about 3 weeks and then went to 300 for over a week now. I do not suffer from anxiety and i am not sure how this would ever be a medication for the treatment of anxiety ? It would seem to me that this medication could very well increase anxiety for those who have anxiety related issues. 
What it has done for me : Got me out of bed instead of sleeping all day for no real reason i could think of . It jump-started me so to speak. I have way more get up and go along with reduced anger,i got away from this senseless sadness,constant rehashing issues i have no control over and this is what i should be.
Hope this continues for me. I get my 6 ,7 or 8 hours of sleep and i am ready to go.I really have nothing negative to say at this point for me."

Dr also gave me 0.5mg of Xanax (helped take the edge of the Wellbutrin XL.Also taking 0.25 Xanax at night to sleep.

Go to PCP & Psychiatrist and was told that it was extremely rare (I'm often the exception to the rule) I stopped them for a few days to see if the ringing would subside. BAD MOVE!!  My mood immediately went south and the crying came back.  I started back after 5 days and in 24hrs I was back to ""normal"".  I  have taken countless anti depression meds over the years.

I've been on Zoloft and didn't really get much out of it. Recently came off Prozac because my side effects were really rare and severe. Wellbutrin gives me energy during the day and helps me wake up with a more positive feeling. Issues that used to send me into a bad funk aren't so bad anymore. I find that I rebound from problems quicker and am able to move on. The only side effects I'm experiencing is a little dry mouth and occasional constipation, but it's all be manageable.

The first time I was extremely depressed and was crying all the time, hated my life, hated my job, etc. etc. I feel that the Wellbutrin it helped each time and I did not need to stay on it permanently. My personal experience with this drug was positive. I did experience constipation however, and this is easily prevented by adding TWO apples to your daily food intake and drinking at least 1 ounce of water, for every 2 pounds of body weight. I will actually be looking to go back on this anti-depressant again soon as I am in the middle of divorce and things are starting to overwhelm me. But I do not feel like I ""need"" it. It is great if you have adult ADHD, or just trouble concentrating/getting things done. I am a superstar at work when I am taking this stuff.  "

I am no longer taking it because I don't feel like I need it now. I went from 300mg. and gradually reduced dosage. A few side effects of anxiety and feeling ""strange"" but were not bad and didn't last long. I believe Psycotropic drugs are like women. Some can help some people and some can't. They are also like men. They are faithful to some and not so faithful to others. Depends on the make-up and physiology of the person.

The side effects are annoying (get less sleep now, increased libido, possible increase in anxiety) and really became noticeable at 300mg. It hasn't hosed me over like just about every other anti-depressant I have taken (and I've tried a couple dozen at this point) so it's the one I have to settle for. I'm taking the SR version in case my IBS acts up. To the person that asked about taking all of the SR's at once, they release the medicine over a 12 hour period, so I have to wonder about that. I spread mine out (loosely every eight hours). On the other hand, having a higher dose during the day may be a good thing. Sounds like you should ask your doctor about this.

I was functioning in life but at a  lower level.  Anyway onto the med review:  MD prescribed 100 mg 1x a day and then told to work up to 200 mg 1x a day after a week.  First week at 100 mg....tons of headaches, crazy dehydration, wierd flighty feeling, nauseus, lack of appetite.  I convinced myself to stick with it at uped my dose.  Experienced 4 days of the worst headaches of my life.  I had to quit completely b/c I couldn't function.  Waited a week and began 100 mg once a day again and this time no headaches,  I am sticking with my low dose since it seems to give me the extra lift I need.  I don't feel medicated or foggy.  The biggest thing to disappear was the feeling of being overwhelmed.  I feel like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.  As for side effects now...I have a tendency to get dehydrated more quickly when on the meds so I have to really drink alot of water.  If I don't hydrate the headaches follow.  Initially my appetite completely disappeared.  Now it's less but not significantly.  This med does seem to reduce cravings in general.  I am not a drinker but had a couple drinks (despite my better judgement) on NY's Eve.  The next day or 2 I felt like the meds weren't working.....felt lethargic, just down.  Definately not worth the drinks of Champagne so I'll abstain 100% for now.  I am at a much lower dosage then is prescribed for most people but it works for me.   Main con i that I do notice that I can become agitated quicker.  I am usually the most laid back person, almost too laid back.  So for me it's not a big deal but I wouldn't recommend this med to anyone who has a tendency to anger easily or experiences anxiety."

I took the 2 a day version for 5 months before not being able to stand the headaches anymore.  I also felt very jittery the first week or so.  I recently switched to the extended release medication and my headaches are gone!  My doctor said that maybe the large dose twice a day was like a fire that then burned out over & over.  I would definitely recommend the extended version of this drug.  In the past I had taken zoloft and I did feel great.  A little too great.  I gained 30 lbs over 6 months and had NO libido.  And I couldn't sleep at night to boot!  I did love how I felt, but I had to sleep and I didn't want to take a medication to sleep every night on top of the zoloft.  I like the welbutrin better for me because it only lessened my symptoms enough to be able to wrap my head around the issues in my life that were completely overwhelming me.  It didn't mask the problems as I felt the zoloft did.  Only helped me feel like I could compartmentalize them and start to deal with them.  Definitely make your doctor give you the extended release!

*and after finally getting off this med, migraines still occur.
I was hospitalized early on from a migraines created by using this drug. **I  had no history of migraines before this. needless to say the doctors do not know these symptoms and do not advise you. i had 5 straight weeks of migraines and discontined Welbutrin XL 150 and on the second day after, the migraines stopped! Also i do not feel suicidal all the time, as with effexor use and welbutrin; that was a 100%- 24/7 hobby with the use of these drugs; thinking of suicide and stopped my artistic life style cold. too bad i let them tell me to take this crap for so long. life's situations don't make us always need a pill... to fix us in the mental department. sad the doctors who give us this stuff- do not know what they are really doing.

Treatments over the previous 20 years included Adapin and Prozac, both of which had unpleasant side affects; nonetheless, I stayed on Prozac for 15 years prior to switching to Welbutrin. My overall experience has been good, especially in the beginning. However, after insurance forced me to start using the generic, I have found it to be less effective than the original formula. I'm thinking about going back to brand name even though I have to pay for it. I hope it's the generic formula and not due to tolerance build up that is causing the waning effects.

I have been on the generic brand of Wellbutrin XL 150mg for 6 weeks now, and feel ""better"" overall (taking med for chronic depression/anxiety) and not having the severe mood swings, nor the usual emotional outburts and crying spells that I used to.  I feel more focused and in control...finally getting myself back and able to smile.  I have completely stopped smoking cold turkey, which was not initially intended, but a definite benefit. I have not had any side effects, except some weight loss due to appetite control, which is also a welcome benefit. I went up to 300mg after 4 weeks, but found it to make me very irritable, so I came back down to 150mg. After visiting my doctor, we decided to add 10mg of the generic Prozac to my med regimen, since I felt that I was very ""indifferent"" and not really finding the ""joy"" in things.  Today was the first day on Prozac...felt lots of energy and remain very optimistic.  Good luck everyone.  You're not alone:)"

They also caused weight gain and sexual disfunction. I was weaned off of them with a lot of withdrawl symptoms. About 8 years ago I was on wellbutrin. I remembered how much better it was than the others. When I felt that things were getting bad again I asked my Dr if he could try me back on that. I immediately had more energy, better attentin span, weight loss and better sex. I am only taking half the dose prescribed, 150mg in the morning. I am now at a plateau, so I may begin taking my second dose of 150 mg early afternoon. The only side effects are slight hand tremors, some irritability and my heart races especially if I have a few drinks. Not enough side effects to give it up. Really, if the other drugs you are taking make you feel lifeless, ask your Dr to try this. When I went off this the first time I had way less withdrawl sickness than the others.

I have been medicatited most of the last 10 years. I was perscribed Welbutrin, and Celexa to take place of prozac, which hasn't really been effective for 2 years.I also started taking Clonopin 6 months ago, .5mg 1 or 2 a day. The Clp I like it seems to really help calm me. I take it around 1 pm before my kids come home from school! My primary care dr. retired so my new dr wasn't comfortable refilling the clonopin because it can be addictive! Who cares if I'm taking it everyday anyway? So I go see a real phsyc. dr. f9or help. The first 2 days I was very tense and jumpy had hot flashes. After that the migrain hit. I have suffered from headaches in the past so didn't relate it to the meds for a couple days. But after 4 days of severe pain in the top of my head, I spoke to my Dr. who said a small percent of people will experience migrain from the Wb. The next morning I had an ice pack on my neck at six am. I took only the Celexa that day and realized around 11am my headache was almost gone! I still had tension and restlessness dry mouth. Today I didn't take anything until about 11 am I took 1/2 clonopin to take the edge off. I am actually feeling good today. I slept better last night. That helped alot! I see him in one week, during that time I will try go solo as much as possible. (I have my clonopin if I get too out of hand!) Then I will ask my dr to try effexor xl. I was on this for 5 years before I got pregnant with my youngest. I did very well after the 1st couple weeks of side effects. Hope this helps someone. I know I go to the reviews to see how pills effect different people. It helps. We all have a different chemistry and a single goal in common...TO FEEL GOOD!

Before taking Wellbutrin, I wasn't a depressed person, but it caused me to become suicidal and ended up overdosing and was hospitalized due to severe seizures.  I was diagnosed in my early 20s with clinical depression, and was put on Wellbutrin XL again to treat it.  It made a major difference in the first 2 months while on it, but after that it became useless and I became more suicidal than ever.  My appetite was very off while on this medication - I could go for two days without feeling hungry and would literally have to force myself to eat.  My anxiety worsened on the medication as well.  I just switched to Zoloft today. Hopefully that will help!

Good progress untill 10 days ago.
Then I started feeling like I hit a plateau.

The mood boost would start wearing-off in the early afternoon.
Anxiety was starting to ramp-up.

Should I ask my doctor to increase WB & perhaps suppliment with something like Lexapro?"

It has made a major positive difference in my life in the way I handle things; I am able to think much more clearly and rationally.  For the first few years I combined the medication with therapy.  I was taking 225 mg when I started and have had to increase it once to 300 mg/ day.  I currently take the Wellbutrin 300 XL.  Word of caution on the generic version of Wellbutrin 300 XL - I tried it when it was approved and found after a few months that I was becoming depressed again.  The generic did not work for me; the tablet may have the same amount of medication but the packing (what makes up the rest of the pill)is completely different than the brand name.  For me it seemed like instead of medication being steadily administered to my system throughout the day it hit all at once, thus the return of the depression.  I was hoping to be able to save some money with the generic but it is worth it to me to take the brand name.

I took 75 mg/day, and it gave me a lot of energy, focus, attention span. However, caused anxiety and the worst symptom was severe hair loss.  The first time I tried it, I noticed the hair loss after 2 weeks.  I stopped taking it for about 6 months.  Then, I gave it another try, thinking maybe it wasn't the Wellbutrin.  As soon as I started taking it again, my hair started coming out by the handfuls, right about 1.5 weeks into taking it.

I felt less depressed and more sleepy. During the day I felt sexually aroused all day, so much that I had to go to the bathroom at work and masturbate several times throughout the day. On the occasion that I did have sex it was embarrassing because my orgasms were so fierce and I would end up drenching my partner. It got to be too much for me to control myself and I had to stop taking it after I developed bad headaches and nosebleeds.

I tried nearly every antidepressant on the market in the 80s. Tri-cyclics, MAOIs, SSRIs, etc. The only drug that initially helped me was Trazodone. When the effects of that started to wane I went to a doctor that prescribed Wellbutrin for me. I immediately received outstanding help from this drug. For the first time since I was a child I felt like a ""normal"" person. It helped with every facet of The Monster, Depression. I have been taking this drug for twenty years and I will never give it up. It and the doctor who prescribed it gave me my life back. It also helps somewhat with Fibromyalgia and CFIDS. It once   helped to keep me awake. I no longer get that benefit from the drug and am taking Provigil to try to remain alert. If you have tried other antidepressants with less than stellar results, please ask your doctor about Wellbutrin. I take 450mgs of Wellbutrin XL in the mornings.

I asked my best friend if she noticed a difference in me and she said if I went off Wellbutrin she wouldn't be my friend! She was only kidding but she said there was a big difference in me, happy, upbeat, positive etc. I tried Wellbutrin generic and it did  nothing for me. Someone talked me into trying Cymbalta because it also helps with Fibromyalgia, it did not help at all and gave me a lot of side effects, weight gain, tremors in my hands, just wanted to sleep and sit and stare at nothing, went off of it and back on Wellbutrin after a 3 month try. I will be staying on Wellbutrin and paying the extra  not to be on the generic.

I've been taking Wellbutrin XL for over 4 years. I also was taking Cymbalta (didn't notice any help from that drug), but stopped due to the perceived ineffectiveness over 6 months ago with no negative effects. WB however seemed to help level out my depression. Instead of the very deep lows they became less severe over time until my mood was manageable. When I began taking WB I immediately noticed a decrease in appetite and lost several pounds right away. In time my appetite came back and have gained the weight back. It also helped with my cravings for habits I had stopped years ago, e.g., smoking, drinking, drugs, etc. If I wanted to stop smoking, drinking or drugs I would HIGHLY recommend WB as an adjunct therapy. I see why ZYBAN is prescribed for smoking cessation! I have tried weening back to 150mg from the 300mg dose I take daily before bed, but noticed mood changes within a week so I went back to 300mg, not wanting to fix it if it wasn't broken. It seems as though I may have to take something for the rest of my life as I have been a lifetime depression sufferer. The only side effect I suffer from is that I think it contributes to sexual dysfunction, but depression itself could be the main culprit. There is no free lunch with any medication. Your mileage may vary ;-).

567$Condition: Depression$7/24/2009 3:46:23 AM$Reviewer: Kathy O, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have suffered from depression most of my life.  In my early 20âs I started see a psychiatrist.  I received talk therapy as well as antidepressantsâ throughout my life.  I have been off & on Prozac for the past 20 years.  For nearly two years, I have had trouble with sleeping too much (anywhere from 12 to 20 hours a night).  When I saw my regular doctor, she suggested increasing my Prozac to 40mg & said I should expect to stay on it for the rest of my life (I am 63).  With no improvement she added Effexor (75mg).  It didnât seem to improve the sleeping or depression.  Besides the excessive sleeping, I also felt like crying all the time; found no joy in life; had no energy; & no motivation to do anything (other than what was absolutely necessary ).  I went to a psychiatrist  and he decreased the Effexor  (37.5mg).  With still no improvement, he stopped the Effexor and started me on Wellbutrin (300mg).  Within about three weeks I felt like a ânormalâ person.  I would wake before the alarm would ring, had more energy and felt not so hopeless. I hadnât felt like this in a long time.  The change lasted about two months.   After he wrote the next prescription for Budeprion XL (300mg), which he said was cheaper.  I started to feel like I was going back to my old pattern of sleeping too much (not as bad as before but still too much) and not as much energy as with Wellbutrin..  I am sad to say I did not experience any weight loss with either the Wellbutrin or the generic.  While taking the generic, I had some adverse effects which include: dry mouth; tremors of the hands; increase in resting heart rate (85+ per minute); trouble keeping my balance and some hair loss.  When I see the psychiatrist in a month, I plan on having write a prescription for Wellbutrin, not the generic.  It is worth the extra money.

Wellbutrin has changed my life.  It has definatly increased quality of life, over quanity of life.  Makes dealing with my everyday disease more at ease, with my physical weakness, and mental tiredness.

But i tried a lot of other meds and the transition was so hard for me that im not sure if i can try something new again. In the beginning i stopped smoking and drinking on this, it was a bonus. In the last few months i do more of both now. I really dont know how i will feel from one moment to the next on this.

It was the first drug I tried and it was a wonder drug for me.I have been on it for 15 years or so. At times, I did struggle and still struggle with suicidal thoughts but that has gotten better as I have gotten older. I did have one period of time where it seemed that the Wellbutrin was loosing its effectiveness. I was weaned off of it and I tried several other antidepressants but none worked as well. I ended up going back on the Wellbutrin and for a short time, was given another medication with it. I am now taking only Wellbutrin and it is once again working well for me most of the time.

Within a day I had nausea, felt like throwing up, headaches, insomnia, and confusion.  Five days after starting, I woke up 5:30 am with such a severe headache I could hardly move, which was followed by severe nausea- my husband got a waste basket for me just in case because I could not move.  I had really bad chest pains added to this, and I counted the minutes till my doctors office opened at 8:00 am.  I had read that some people had more severe side effects with the generic version.  The active ingredient is the same amount in both, but the other components are different, causing some people to react differently.  I wanted to be prescribed Wellbutrin, not the generic, and within a day, most of the symptoms had gone.  What a relief.  It has been mostly a good change- I feel more calm, less anxious, and able to concentrate more, I feel almost ""normal"", but I still have some agitation and sometimes cry at small things, but do not feel depressed, if that makes any sense.  It usually only lasts a few minutes.  I think it would be beneficial to add another medication to this to maximize my results."

I was on it a little over 2 yrs ago to take the edge off. Love it. Lost about 10 lbs and felt great. Did make my thoughts less clear, and got off of it when I had to make some life-changing decisions. Got back on it now, and it is hard to adjust to in the beginning. Mood swings for sure. And I agained 4 lbs in a week! The opposite of what I wanted to happen. Hopefully it will change and go the other way. No sexual side effects except that it is better!  I do have a range of emotions every day though from being confident and secure to being totally insecure and emotional. This too, I hope will pass soon. Can't stand it and I know that I am hard to be around now.

I feel lucky to have gotten it right on the first try. Before I began taking Wellbutrin XL I was very depressed, specifically I felt like everybody hated me and conspired against me. After taking it I feel normal again. I know it works becuase if I miss a few pills the same feelings come back until I start taking the pills regularly again. They seem to have a few day delay. Also, my pharmacy gave me the generic version one time so I thought what the heck and decided it wasn't a big deal, but I was wrong. It made my feel like I wasn't taking anything at all and the old feelings were back. After that I made sure my pharmacy always gave me the name brand. This drug really works for me.

There is a difference in absorption rates among the generics and I felt like I was getting it all at once-  Zoned out, headache, down right rotton and tired.  I read an article about some having the same problem so tomorrow I'm back to wellbutrin.  Also it's common to need another medication with this to combat what I call compulsive hyper nastiness.  Everyone is different to what brand/dosage/combination works for them and requires alot of patience.  If you don't feel your dr is listening to you when you're not feeling well, move on to another dr. Just like meds, some drs are better than others.  :)

I have had other mental health issues other than depression for which my doctors prescribed Wellbutrin.

Turned out that I had bipolar type II.

Regardless, at the times I would go off of Wellbutrin, I would get into addictive habits like excess drinking and other unsavory vices.

Now, I don't think Wellbutrin is all that effective since I take other drugs that address the underlying issues I have with the bipolar and ADHD.

I am so mean and say awful things to people.  It has not helped at all with my depression.  In fact, my depression is worse.  On Effexor XR, I never cried or felt like crying.  On Wellbutrin I cry during commercials.  This medication does not work for me at all.  My doctor wants me to switch to Lexapro.

It does make me hyper and at times very aggresive but I know it is just the medicine and I can keep it in check.  I haven't gained any weight either.  The only negative thing I can say about it is if I take too much of this medicine, I feel very irratated. I have to space 2 150mg XL at least 4 hours apart. I can't take one 300 mg XL at one time.

I was prescribed 150mg, but after 5 days I had to get off.  I started to get increasingly shaky and I got a bad sore throat and dry mouth.  I didn't sleep for like 2 days, and I started to act kind of weird - like I blew everything out of proportion.  I also started to get nauseous and have headaches.  Anyway, the evening of the 5th day of being on Wellbutrin, I ended up having my first ever panic attack...the night before a final.  It was horrible - it was one of the worst nights of my life.  Thankfully I was able to get a hold of my psychiatrist who was able to get my final rescheduled - I know for a fact I would not have been in any shape to take it the next day.   

Anyway, I'm disappointed Wellbutrin didn't work for me.  I realize that it helps a lot of people, but if you start to get these types of anxiety/mood symptoms, go off before it gets any worse - because it will, and it's not fun.  "

I felt so much better on it but as of now, I am 40 lbs heavier. I have maintained the same weight for like past couple years prior to taking Zoloft and now I cannot stop gaining. It averages about 10 lbs a year and changes in diet and increases in exercise did nothing for me. I got frustrated and depressed about myself so I called my PCP and told him I wanted to try wellbutrin xl, because I heard its does the same thing and often causes people to lose weight rather than gain. I have been taking the generic Buproprion SR now for a little over a month and I am completely miserable. Apparently, people who have anxiety are not supposed to take this drug because it only treats depression and a side effect of it is an increase in anxiety. I have been experiencing loss of appetite but that come with nausea and queasiness-- I feel like I am pregnant (and I am not!). My head feels like its out of whack and I cant really describe the way that it messes with my vision and hearing without sounding like a whack job. My doctor should have known that this drug, with is an SNRI will not help me the way an SSRI does because of my anxiety. This past weekend I graduated college-- an important part of my life-- and I felt incredibly hostile and would go from screaming at my friends and family to bawling my eyes out in 2.5 secs. Thanks, doc. I am glad that I have google and WebMD to tell me what I should/should not take, because he apparently cannot.

I just recently switched from Paxil to Wellbutrin XL (generic). The first two days I took it, I felt wonderful! I felt like the old me again! Then I became dizzy & tired. I had constant headache & unending nausea - and I've only been taking it for about a week.  I haven't taken it in for two days now and I am still having horrible stomach problems and dizziness.  The only good thing so far is that I am not smoking as much, only about 2 or 3 cigarettes a day from smoking about a pack a day. Guess I will be going back to the doctor very soon for something else. I wish there was an easier way of finding a medication that worked. I feel like a lab rat going through all these different medicines!

The wellbutrin itself worked great, I had loads of energy and did not experience any of the side effects. However, since I've switched to the buprpion,(due to insurance prefering everyone use Generic),I have tried 3 other antidepressants to try to help with the side effects. My mood has changed dramatically for the worse, no energy, headaches or migraines at least 3 times a week, have not even wanted to quit smoking, and now I am at the point of just staying alone, not want to join in family functions or talk to my closest friends. I highly recommend that anyone taking Bupropion XL talk to their physician about writing a letter of referal for the name brand Wellbutrin XL to the insurance company because the Generic is not the same and does not have the equality as the Wellbutrin.

In December I began taking the 300mg XL version.  It helped me tremendously.  I had so much energy and motivation to do things.  It was a generic.  In March I had to switch my pharmacy so they gave me a different generic.  It was made by Watson.  I started getting really tired all the time.  I was constantly angry with people for no good reason and also seemed to be obbsessive compulsive.  There were also many physical side effects also.  I finally realized it was the medicine and stopped it immediately.  I began feeling so much better within 24 hours.  I can't believe the difference in these generics.  Please pay close attention to how you begin feeling when you take these.  I seriously think I would have become suicidal if I had not quit and I have never felt that way before.  If it's not working for you go to your doctor and try something else because these medicines can really change your entire personality.

Maybe I'm just sensitive I guess.  With this one the worst was probably the constipation and blurred vision with bouts of dizzy spells where I felt off balance all of a sudden.

However, I experienced a paradoxical reaction to the medicine about 48 hours after first use.  Interestingly, the first time I used it, I felt better.  Not the next... I felt like I wanted to die.  I have had depression most of my life, and this beat everything I have ever felt (this was a -1 dose- effect, btw).  I quit taking it immediately and tossed it in the trash.  I had an appointment with my psychiatrist the next day, and told him all about it.  Normally, a doctor would say not to miss a dose (which I did by not taking it the next morning) without asking, but mine said he was glad I got off it.  Desipramine works better for me.

Not suggesting that this is a poor drug; I'm sure it's great for many people.  However, believe it when they say it can have side effects or make you feel worse..."

This is not about Wellbutrin, but the generic, Budeprion SR 150 mg x2. Irritability, jitters, at first, with 2nd dose at noon--super-witch, anger replaying itself.  I checked reviews of generic first, before reading here.  Many of the same comments were made.  At first, it seemed to work w/Lexapro.  Then after weening from Lexapro I  felt so brain racing and fatigue from the event.  Thought it was the Lexapro withdrawal.  Paid attention to my reactions after a.m. dose only and then with noon dose.  There appears to be a cumulative negative effect, producing more irrational impatience.  I'm scared; will discuss w/psych after having read generic reviews and Wellbutrin reviews.  I  do not normally have bad reactions to any kinds of medication.  NB: the generic medication seemed to work w/ Lexapro for a year. I've been on the genric Budeprion SR for two months. I'll ask to switch to the Wellbutrin and write back.  I've been retired about a year--I should be relaxed.

In that time I went from being my easy going sweet self to a witch on wheels. It was bad enough for my whole family to sit me down. I was later diagonsed with bi-polar due to extremely stressful conditions. I'm not sure if this medication exaserbated that problem since at the time it had gone undiagnosed. I would recommend before starting anything for depression you make sure that's all you're dealing with.

637$Condition: Depression$4/7/2009 11:02:49 AM$Reviewer: lazybonz,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on wellbutrin for 15 years-I came off of it for a short time but the anxiety caused me to return to it again. Like most depression sufferers I have tried many drugs over the years but this one has the least side effects and works great. I occasionally get dry mouth so you do need to stay hydrated.  I was a smoker and a drinker and have kicked both habits as the drug really does reduce cravings for any pleasure. Unfortunately that does include sex as well-it does decrease your libido but that can be overcome if you work at it! It does not decrease the pleasure level but the desire to get started just isn't there. I did have a period of time where I was not eating as it does also take away your cravings for food. My hubby loves to eat so he makes me eat too,so I have not had anorexia since I met him but I did with my first husband. So I would say that an understanding mate goes a long way toward helping to make this drug a success. I take 150 sr upon waking and before bed. My insurer is also pushing the generic but that did not work for me. I understand there are some generics that are better than others and if the cost is a factor you could try those first. I am convinced that wellbutin treats alcoholism because it runs in my family and I was a problem drinker until I took wellbutrin. I can have a drink now and not want another-but that may just be me. It is sure worth a try if you drink too much-I don't know why it is not more widely used for treating alcoholism because it works. You do have to take wellbutrin for 60 to 90 days to get the full effect of the drug.During that time you do have dry mouth but that subsides after a while and was not a significant problem for me. I am 62 years old so I don't know how much longer I will take it but the doctors seem to think that it is a lifelong drug. It has made a drastic change in my life and I recomend it highly!!

I have tried it all.  Paxil made me sleepy and sweat but relieved anxiety, Prozac gave me tons of energy but made me 'crazy' and moody, Cymbalata made my anxiety go thru the roof, Celexa didn't do anything. I was on Zoloft for years, it was great for the anxiety but not the depression.  I slept a lot and just had no ambition to do anything more than I had to. I am now on the generic of this - 150 the first week and I am in day 2 of 300mg.  I LOVE IT SO FAR!!  My energy is through the roof, my fog of depression has lifted and I feel great.  My only side affect so far is that I seem to have an aching back, that could be due to the anxiety level needing to balance out.  However, I will take a slightly aching back over no energy and sleeping all of the time!
One thing I have learned is that everyone reacts differently to each med. so you just have to find the one that works for you."

I can cope .  I tried stopping several times, became immediately in major depression.  I started with low dose,gradually over the years increased to 300mg.  I have tried every version and every generic and brand name, each one is a little different because of absorption rate is differs from brand to brand.  All are effective, but I do notice differences if affect and side-effects.  Some are absorbed more slowly so work best when take b4 bedtime to not interfere with sleep, but others donot.  Also different people will experience different absorption rates between brands and dosages.  So you all hang in their, talk to your Dr.

The first few days on 150 mg were a little scary.  I had a headache the entire time.  This only lasted about 3 days.  On the fifth day started 300 mg.  Loved the energy boost and eveniness of my mood. I also immediately quit smoking...have tried quitting many times before with no success. I started getting bad cramps and realized I was horribly constipated.  Tried upping my fiber and fluid intakes but nothing helped.  I had to stop taking it because of this...BUMMER.  I really liked this med and wish I could continue but I can't take laxative everyday to conteract the constipation!!!!!!!  Some decrease in sexual desire did occur.  My doc prescribed me Effexor XR and I filled the ordered but I do not think I will try this one because of the horrible things I have been reading about it.  I will be asking her about Cymbalta because the reviews seem much more positive.  I wish the makers of Wellbutrin/Bupripion could fix the constipation issue because it worked great for me!

I wasn't given the XL to start off with and for some reason...just couldn't remember to take 1 pill 3 times a day.  I am a SUPER busy mom and full time college student (aren't we all super busy though?).  Anywho, After 2 weeks I went to the doc to let him know about my difficulty and THEN he gave me the XL...it is SO much easier taking 1 pill in the morning and being done with it.  So far, things seem to be improving.  I am on the 300.  It has ALSO cut back my craving to smoke (AWESOME..since taxes went through the roof..again).  My depression seems to be getting a little better but I haven't experienced any weight loss that I was REALLY looking forward to.  LOL!  
I am giving the XL a month to ""kick in"" and hopefully by then my depression will have subsided or at least decreased more.  Oh...ALSO...I AM tired ALL THE TIME!  But if the medication helps me smile again and feel ""normal"" then perhaps less sleep and an occasional redbull will make it all worth while  :o)
Good luck to everyone who is taking this...I not only hope it works for me...but for all of you as well!!!

681$Condition: Depression$2/24/2009 8:24:38 PM$Reviewer: ABMN, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$In Dec 2007 I was prescribed Wellbutrin 150mg, after the initial few weeks it just didn't seem to be working. My doctor bumped me up the the XL. It started working almost immediately. It felt as if the veil and earmuffs had been removed and colors and sounds became real again. I was extremely happy with the 50 lbs I lost. Sex drive came back with a vengeance. No listed side effects. It is now Feb 2009 and it doesn't seem to be working anymore; back to being irritable, short tempered and just sad. Going to Dr in 2 days to see if something else will work. One side effect that I can't find anyone else having is it messed with my period, even on birth control. My period would come whenever it wanted regardless of what week of pills I was on. Once I switched to taking the BCP at night and Wellbutrin XL in the a.m. it seemed to get MUCH better. Now that the wellbutrin isn't working as great, my cycle is completely whacked. Usually one week w/o it, then get it for a few days, then another week w/o, etc. Doctors say it has nothing to do with each other but I have been on the same BCP for almost 6 years and it didn't happen until I started taking the Wellbutrin XL.

I combine Wellbutrin XL 150mg with Adderall XR 15mg during the week, and take just the Wellbutrin on weekends (when I don't work).  I have had few negative side effects-- the two noticeable are the dry mouth (the dryness affects intercourse as well) and hair loss, which I experienced when I was on the 300 mg dose.  I backed down to the 150mg and the hair loss has stopped.  I am grateful I was prescribed this drug first-- it really does work quite well.

I've been on Wellbutrin for (about) a year and MUST comment on the effects of the generic brand, Bupropion (Sp?). 
   Because I don't have insurance, I spent a while on the generic version and failed to progress out of my depressive state. For a few weeks I felt like I was mildly feeling a change, but eventually it felt like I had plateaued, and shortly after, I returned to spiraling downward. 
   There were other medications added and subtracted to Wellbutrin in order to determine the right combination of drugs to aid my depression/anxiety/ADD. I AM POSITIVE that my only improvement was the result of other medications (Lamictal- mood stabilizer). 
   It has been documented that the generic version of this drug does NOT produce the same progressive results as the name brand. I can confidently say, that my experience w/ Bupropion was not a good one, in fact, I'd say it was horrible, and at times, worse than my initial state.
   I have been back to taking the name brand Wellbutrin XL for about 3-4 months. I have continued to feel a drastic improvement in my mental state, and finally recognize the person that I knew I always was. It has enabled me to live my life again.   
   Although I have felt such a great improvement, the cost is $167 (that's with insurance), which is the CO-PAY! Without the insurance, the cost is $230-$270, and very few insurance companies offer reasonable coverage for Wellbutrin XL, since the generic version was approved."

It definetly helped me overcome my depression for a while. However the drug did give me seizures. I'd take 5 or 6 Wellbutrins a day (as opposed to one)to get high and lose wieght. This gave me grand mal seizures. I stopped the drug and resumed my pill regimen months later, vowing to take only one pill a day. I did, but still had seizures. The seizures weren't a result of overdosing on the wellbutrin. They happened because I was taking them while abusing street drugs (Ecstasy and Cocaine). Please, tell you doctor if you have a drug problem or are prone to overdosing on OTC/prescription pills for fun. I crashed my car into a tree during one of the seizures I had.

After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, I don't build up a tolerance (even after 10 years), and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

It took about 3 months for it to fully work. For 8 months I felt absolutely wonderful. I had energy & drive to exercise, I smiled & laughed again. Did not help my anxiety but I still take Lorazepam for that. In the last 3 weeks (about a year since I started it) I've become very depressed, irritated at stupid things, angry. This morning my doctor said sometimes it just doesn't work anymore. She prescribed Cymbalta so I'm going to wean off of Wellbutrin while weaning onto Cymbalta over the next 6 weeks.  I do know people who got WORSE using Wellbutrin, I know some who love it after years of use. I was right in the middle. I loved it but it just stopped working. 

Also I lost the 25 lbs that I had gained on Lexapro once the Wellbutrin worked. "

It really helps visualize what is wrong and what needs to be worked on. If you start missing doses, you will fall pretty hard so be careful about that. That is the set back about some drugs, though take them as prescribed. If not regularly, tell doctor and why that is. For me, it has better results with Abilify.

Wellbutrin has been a life saver for me. It works very well for me combined with Effexor XR.  Took a long time to find a combination that worked. I have more control over my emotions, irritability,anger and suicidal thoughts. I feel so ""normal"" sometimes I forget my meds. Isn't long before (24-48 hours) before I notice a difference and get back in control. 
Unfortunately, my medical insurance changed this year and instead of a $35.00 co-pay, it is now $215.00 co-pay for the Wellbutrin. I am guessing it is to force folks to get the generic. I refuse, I know I will not do as well on the generic.I am scared,I do not want to go through the misery of finding a substitute. What if I can't find something that works as well for me?

All previous medications were either ineffective, or caused intolerable side effects. Wellbutrin, for me, is a miracle drug, allowing me to function like a normal person.

I have been prescribed different medications due to insurance.  When Wellbutrin went generic I was prescribed it again.  It took about four weeks before I seemed to notice a difference.  I am not as hungry, and I am having a easier time with my emotionsbut I think the dose needs to be higher.  I have not had any of the listed side effects.

I took the generic for two weeks then switched to 150mg brand. After taking this for a month, I feel great. The depressed, gray feeling is completely gone, and I have more energy. I haven't noticed any side effects, but I did lose about five pounds (which I wanted to do anyway). I eat less now but feel much healthier. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this drug.

It worked great with the Zoloft, it gave me that extra boost I needed to help me back to being myself again. I could no longer afford the medications when i left the military so i decided to stop them cold turkey and did not have any side effects like i did when trying to be weaned off just the zoloft. I think this is a great medication and can help when taken with other medications when you dont want to up the doses anymore, this can give you a different mix to help. It's worth a shot
735$Condition: Depression$12/23/2008 5:18:12 PM$Reviewer: BobbyPeru, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$Prior to this medication (I take the generic, Bupropion XL), I had tried a couple of different medications. None of them worked well.  Then, my doctor prescribed this. After about three weeks, I noticed that I would wake up without the customary depression that had been afflicting me for over a year and a half. Mind you, the depression has not gone away, but it has lessened greatly. The medication also sped up my metabolism and I lost weight. Nice. I also have more energy and my mind is not as lethargic as before. I take the medication with Lamictyl for anxiety and mood swings. Bupropion's side effects are occasional hyperactivity,  occasional stomachaches and frequent visits to the number for number 2, which may be caused by my sped up metabolism. Furthermore, my libido has increased and my performance in that department has improved. I am fortunate to be taking these medication and hope the benefits to not subside with time. Again, I emphasize that the depression has not ceased completely, but it has lessened in frequency and intensity.

Torture is the best way to discribe it. I tried Effexor, Lexapro & Prozac. I experienced absolutly no relief from any of these.  Then I tried Wellbutrin.  I thank God for the relief I felt within the first week.  I am taking 150 mg once a day & feel that this is a little on the low side as far as dosage.  I have no side effects.  I would recomend this medication but not in generic form.  The generic affected me in a bad way with many side effects.  If your depression is brought on by Chantix try Wellbutrin.  I hope this helps.

I also took lunesta to handle a sleep disorder (waking up like clockwork 3 hours into my sleep). I needed something to schock my out of my usual habits of depressiveness, and it did shock me, but made me different, but not much better. Made me much more volatile, although happier in general. When I would have a low, although less often, they would feel like life or death lows. And my tension increased. But it did change things, atleast, just not for much better. But different, but still bad, is better than same and still bad.

It was easy to use. Only thing is trying to take it regularly and trying not to get drunk while taking it.

I'm pretty neutral about satisfaction. I believe it may work for some, but it increased my volatility, although it did do *something*, atleast.

We tried many different dosages, but I had awful side affects-constipation, sweating, ringing in the ears, weird weight fluctuations, and almost constant headaches.Having to take it two or three times a day was really diffult to manage. I continued to feel sad, hopeless, and TIRED. I slept all the time. This medication did NOT work for me at all and I weaned myself from it according to my doctor's instructions. I am now on Paxil and still have constant fatigue and headaches. Although Paxil has worked for me in the past, it's not doing for me what it used to. After the fiasco with Wellbutrin, I am not looking forward to trying yet another medication.

With the Wellbutrin XL as part of his regimine, his moods are more even as he only has to take the medication once a day;  with a twice daily medication, he would often forget to take the second dosage so I  love the time release aspect.  He doesn't have any sexual side effects which is great and just has to watch what he eats (low carb diet) to keep the weight off.  I am every pleased with the effect this has had on his depression.

I have a tendency to be anxious and I don't really think it does too much to help with that.  The only side effect is that I feel a bit jittery but feel more alert.  Also, it has definitely cut my appetite which has helped get rid of a little extra weight that I put on over the past year (which I think was due to Zoloft and depression).

Actually it made the anxiety problem twice as bad. Overall it was ok for the depression but I could not maintain an erection for nothing while I was taking this product. Which is due to the anxiety issue caused by this product. One minute I was semi hard and as soon as I would think about my problem, it would just shibble up. Or even if I heard a sound like the wind blow, the party was over. I have stopped taking this product for only a week now and Ole Willie is standing proud again.
The only problem is now I can see a slight depression behavior problem returning and I do not know what to do. I do not want to have issues but if I can't enjoy having a sex life, it's depressing too!"

I started at 75mg 2x/day, and am currently at 100mg 2x/day.  My depression symptoms have subsided and I am more comfortable around people with less irritability.  However, I continue to have anxiety and constant worry (Generalized Anxiety Disorder).  It appears that Wellbutrin does not list this as one of the treatable conditions.  I am considering switching to Prozac instead.  One major plus about Wellbutrin is that it has had no sexual side effects on me, unlike other antidepressants I've tried before such as Paxil and Lexapro.  Also, I haven't had any weight gain from taking Wellbutrin; however, my appetite has increased (I get hungry quicker).  If depression is the only condition to be treated, then I would recommend Wellbutrin.

I've been taking generic Wellbutrin 75mg for less than a week now, and so far it seems to be helping. I'm sometimes groggy in the morning, but it goes away and I feel awake and clear-headed all day. One unusual thing: by evening I sometimes feel anxious, and two nights ago I had a full-blown panic attack and could not stop crying and feeling scared. I had a very stressful day at work though so maybe I can attribute the panic to that. I also notice changes in my appetite, like I will be hungry but not want food, or feel full after three bites of something. My energy level seems better, and I don't feel a lack of sexual desire like I did before the drug. The flat, gray feeling seems to be lessening. Overall, I do feel better, like a fog has been lifted off of me.In two weeks I'll switch to the brand-name version at 150mg, so hopefully things keep improving. Hope this helps!

Honestly, it was like putting on a pair of glasses for the first time after not realizing you'd been looking a blurry world.  It did make it easier to get up in the morning, it didn't affect my weight, it didn't affect my sex drive or the quality of sex, AND it really improved my daily depression.  Apparently it is the only anti-depressant that doesn't have any usual sexual side effects, if that's something important to you.

I don't cry at everything anymore- in fact, hardly at anything, I'm not as socially aggressive when I get angry, and it takes considerably more to make me angry.  I am still irritable, and that's something I wish would get better, but I'm glad not to be so miserable and ""blah"" everyday... I figure, at least I'm not an emotional wreck and I can at least tolerate some of the things that were making me feel terrible before.  Also, I have definitely experienced decrease in appetite... I don't eat much during the day, but sometimes at night I'll wake up and find myself going to the fridge to make myself a sandwich because I'm so hungry from not eating all day!  Also, I find it more difficult to fall asleep, and normally I go to bed pretty early and have no issues, so it's weird for me.  Other than the appetite and insomnia this med seems ok.  I might consider doubling up to see if it will help my irritability, but I will give it another week."

IF this is the case why would anyone want to put this drug in their body which might effect their brain function as well as Kidneys and Liver..

Curious what the top 20 Drugs the FDA recalled and never listed in the newspapers.

All drugs if labeled may cause dizzyness, don't operate heavy machinery etc should not even take the drug.. Try holistic methods such as Tai Chi , Meditation, Omega-3 capsules vegetarian ones..

I have been on Elavil for many years and it has helped. After the death of a person very important in my life, I became very depressed even on the Elavil. My Dr. put me on Wellbutrin along with the Elavil.  I can not believe the change in my life.  My personality has changed and I am able to deal with every day things so much better than any time in my life. I have, or had, a very nasty temper and I am very sick over the times I lost my temper and caused much hurt to others. I did things, in this uncontrolable temper, that I will never forgive my self for. I have been able to deal with getting mad and upset like a real person. I was so afraid that when I did have a situation I would lose it again. That has not happened at ALL on this.  It is hard to understand unless you have this kind of personialty. I can never thank enough who ever developed this medication.  I do not have the right words to express this. Thank you

Rather than increase the Effexor my doctor decided to add the Wellbutrin. I also saw a Clinical nurse on the recomendation of my therapist. She said she wasn't that familiar with this combination but if it was working she said not to change. She said she would have probably increased the Effexor to a higher level. She said most doctors get nervous with that and usually add another medication. Right now I am feeling better and will only call my therapist or clinical nurse if the depression comes back.

Had to stop taking generic because of social aggression.Still impatient after 2 months off the drug.Helped stop smoking after 50 years. Folks argumentative in the family but better than withdrawn and depressive. Just watch the personality changes and weigh if you can tolerate those effects as above. It will give you energy...that's nice.

I literally felt like a zombie once re-prescribed this medication (I did not take the medication while pregnant). Times where it was perfectly normal for me to cry (like a funeral) I would not cry at all. I was desensitized to the world around me to include my newborn. I immediately took myself off the medication without the guidance of the doctor (bad idea - but at the time it worked for me). I did not have any withdrawal issues, which is a good thing! Nevertheless, I begin to try other medications in hopes of addressing my depression. But, I did not want to go through life feeling numb. In the end, I have turned to herbal treatment which is working wonders for me. I will NOT go back to this medication. I promised myself and those who love me. "

I was having difficulty coping with life, home alone with 5yr and 3yr and hubby gone during the week (truck driver) I also had to sell my beautiful home cause of finanical problems. I actaully could get out of bed & felt normal for once, got my energy back & alot more patience with my kids (both hyper),I also lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks (that was great cause I'm 40 pounds overweight from the depression) The only problems is that the side effects started when my MD double the dose week 2. Three days after starting to take 300mg, I broke out in hives just on my face. I couldn't leave the house until they went away! I also feel a little absent minded, spelling words wrong and forgeting what I was doing. I didn't have these problems with the 150mg. Off meds for awhile until rash clears up and then going back to 150 and see what happens.

It has made it easier for me to get out of bed and has stopped me from crying for no reason.  There seem to be two types of generic pills; I found one didn't help me at all, but the other one (purple colored) was as effective as the brand name version.  I experience shaking hands and constipation from the medication.  It doesn't cause the low sex drive and weight gain that I've experienced with other medications.  
839$Condition: Depression$7/30/2008 4:38:57 PM$Reviewer: $5$5$5$Wellbutrin was like a miracle drug for me.  I never took anything that actually made a difference.  I took 450mg/day.  It was so good it stabilized me from feeling suicidal.

However I had side effects that were somewhat annoying and made me stop the drug. Most noteable to me was a slight tremor in my hands, making handwriting look worse.

I switched to the generic, but i have lost my sex drive and vomit randomly and sweat alot(not often, but it is annoying when you are out and start sweating and get sick). seems like name-brand wellbutrin is the way to go. I lost more than 20 pounds taking this. Chronic depression runs in the family so my mom switched antidepressants to this drug and she likes it too. try it it might be worth it for you
844$Condition: Depression$7/13/2008 2:24:38 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$1$I rated the effectiveness of this drug 5 stars because in conjunction with 30mg of Lexapro, it helped relieve the depression. I think it is important to note however that this drug caused me to noticeably shake my hands all day. I am a phlebotomist and this had a negative affect on my job. Also, while it takes away the depression, it causes your mind to not really care about anything. Sure, your not depressed, but you become emotionless. Maybe my side effects were due to the combination but I just want to stress the fact that you need to be very careful before just taking what is prescribed to you by the physician. I believe I had TOO much drug therapy.
845$Condition: Depression$7/12/2008 11:02:42 AM$Reviewer: Dee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$2$My depression was triggered by my brothers suicide & moms cancer diagnosis(both within 2007.) I have been trying to find somthing to just get me through this time so I can be sane for my family- not to pretend it is not there. I am on my second month on Welbutrin. It took at least a month to kick in. I was irritated easily for the first few weeks, but that went away a few weeks ago. I have lost just a few pounds and I do not feel like a flat line like I did on Lexapro. My sex drive is also still intact, thank God! The only downfall is that every night I get nausea, wich is why for me, it is not easy to use. My doc says to wait it out a few more weeks and make sure to take it every MORNING (I work nights so I took it later) I tried to have two drinks one night, and almost vomitted. I also got airsick for the first time. But I laugh again, and I am ready to be there for my mom now, who will be undergoing a stem-cell transplant soon. The stress is not gone- but I can at least handle it better now.My husband and mom both need me too much for me to wallow in misery all the time. If only I could get rid of the damn nausea! Oh yea, my husband said he noticed my memory has been better. I used to think depression was somthing you could talk yourself out of. Somtimes you have nothing left to give, and that is when it is time to see a doc or counseling to search what is right for you. I hope this helped someone because alot of the others helped me. Good luck!

I take it for depression/anxiety and it made me feel flat, better then being on nothing but nothing I wanted to stay on.  I stuck it out for a year and just went off it a month ago.  I tried Prozac which worked great with the exception of sexual side affects.  Wellbutrin made me sweat a lot, had trouble sleeping, still had these weird mood swings and lack of energy.  So I am trying Cymbalta.  I guess I will have to wait and see.  I wouldn't take Wellbutrin again, it really wasn't worth it.  Wish the Prozac didn't cause the sexual side affects because that worked great for me.

I realized I needed to be treated for depression when I was in my early 30's. I finally went to a doctor and asked for help. After trying some different medications and dosages we finally decided on Wellbutrin XL 450mg with Effexor XR 225mg. I've been on this for about 2 years. IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID! My anxiety and anger was gone after a few weeks. I stopped fighting with my husband and co-workers everyday. I was able to take difficult situations in stride. The worst side effect was dry mouth. I will say that after reading some of these reviews I'm terrified to ever go off of the Effexor XR.

I have no signs of improvement with my depression. It did give me an energy boost to begin with but that only lasted about 3 - 4 months. Most importantly I have realized that a drug can not change the people around you just you. So if your depression is due to things outside of you it will have littel to no effect for you. At next appointment I will be asking to be taken off of it.

Half that did absolutely nothing for my depression and same results for trying to stop smoking.  Am hoping that taking double my previous dosage will make me a veritable vegetable, so that I don't have to deal with my two rotten 5-6-yr.-olds.  Taking 150-dosage, there was no effect either way--which means it sucked BIG TIME.  I want to be ""comfortably numb,"" but lousy Wellbutrin XL does nothing to assuage my abject disgust with my children (& at times with my wife, who hardly ever interacts with the buggers).

865$Condition: Depression$5/20/2008 4:59:02 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Initially started with Zoloft, which was really good for depression and anxiety. The only thing about Zoloft was, not only did it take away the anxiety...it took away all my emotions!! I was numb. Was not sad, was not happy, just didn't feel anything. A friend of mine's infant died recently, and I was sad for her in my head. I wanted to cry, but couldn't.  It also takes away the libido. Yeah...that sucks. So my doc switched me to Wellbutrin 100mg, and at first, just like a post I read earlier. I felt drugged, tired and wierd. I kept taking it though. It's been about a month, and I love it. It's false happiness in a pill, but I guess that is better than none at all right? I love it !!! I am not as anti-social as I had become.

Could the anxiety come from Wellbutrin or taking less Effexor? Have been on Effexor for only 5 weeks, tolerated it well. Before then I was on Lexapro. Effexor and Lexapro help my emotional symptoms but physically I feel run down and constantly fatigued. That's why we're trying different drugs now.

889$Condition: Depression$3/31/2008 7:48:49 PM$Reviewer:  (Patient) $4$1$4$The first time I took this drug I took it for almost a year and had no problems with it, other than some diahrrea. I recently resumed taking it again after being off of it for almost 6 months due to problems with my insurance. For the past two days I have suffered with horrible anxiety attacks, I had to go to the emergency room yesterday. I have never had anxiety attacks or anxiety problems before. I think I would rather be depressed than experience anything like that ever again. I felt like I was on acid or losing my mind or something. In addition to the new anxiety, it has also caused me to be continuously either constipated or have diahrrea, nothing in between. It also gave me insomnia, which by itself is  manageable but coupled with anxiety it can drive a person insane. I will not take this drug again, even if it means crying out my depressions and talking myself out of suicide. Be careful and be prepared.

I started falling into depression after my first pregnancy, everyone told me it would go away but it didn't.  Than after losing my second pregnancy at 20 weeks (twins), I couldn't handle it.  After being depressed and not recognizing myself for about a year and a half I decided to do something about it.  My doctor put me on 300 mg of the XL.  And I had some of the side effects like not sleeping, dry mouth, lower libedo.  But the whole libedo and sleeping thing now have subsided and with the whole dry mouth I just drink a lot of water.  Which isn't a bad thing.  I love this drug, I have more energy during the day, I am back to my old happy self.  And my husband is happy because I am back to the person he married and not some Psyco women that he never knows what mood she is going to be in or what will set her off next.

So I went to the dr. and she suggested this. She said it's supposed to help with my anxity,deppression and promote weightloss. Right now my moods are all over the place, but I expected that just hope it goes away. I'll write back in a couple weeks O I have notice already the appetite change, not so much in chage of smoking yet.

For my moderate depression it worked very well but after long term use I just felt ""numb"". It killed my libido and it left me with a feeling of ambivalence.

My doctor switched me to wellbutrin sr (which didnt work as well for me) but the time i was on wellbutrin xl, it changed my life! Grades improved, I was getting honors (something I had never gotten before) and I was very very driven and motivated to do things. It helped my concentration so much and my desire to accomplish things in my life. I will give this warning: once being on it for long periods of time I felt great and felt like I didnt need meds anymore. I would stop taking it and within a month later would have horrible episodes from being off of it. This happened to me about three times. Once your on it, it is hard to get off but it definately improved my life. I am now on an SSRI and have found that I have no emotion at all and its hard to feel anything. While on wellbutrin, I still could feel emotions,etc. It didnt take every feeling away from me totally. This is a good drug to take, especially for a teenager, that is when I started it. I attribute all my accomplishments to this drug, I realy would not be where i am today without it and I am looking in to going back on it in combination with my SSRI

I've been on it since it was created. If you want further info you can email me b/c it won't all fit here: [emailÂ protected] This drug works for depression & smoking cessation-no doubt. However, don't expect to be able to stop taking it, in my case, perhaps ever. 5 x's I've stopped. The 1st 3 were due to no insurance & by the 3rd I was 'rationing' pills and splitting them in half. The 4th was an attempt to ween myself and the 5th was w/a Dr.'s assistance that Rx'd another drug to ease me off. I CANNOT BE WITHOUT THIS DRUG. It's a horrendous 'rubber band effect' I call the ""crash n burn"". It took awhile for me realize that It may be a month or so after it's out of your system to happen, but it will happen, and it will be harsh. I have taken this drug w/little conjunction of other drugs and know that it works to promote an overall sense of well being. BUT there are side effects [for me-everyone is different and thus cannot be expected to have the exact same experience]. For me I do have dry mouth, periodic insomnia, lower sex drive and constipation (the latter 2 were present before, just intensified by the drug). I feel like a Rx junkie, getting low on this drug causes me to panic. I have hoarded it for ins. changes. You win GSK- you now own me. I hope you're happy and proud of yourself. Despite choosing to be happy and not wanting to rely on a chemical to make that be, I no longer can. Perhaps I'm being too harsh on GSK and I truly have a chemical imbalance that will always need to be corrected??? Could be. I just think the warning should be known of how powerful Wellbutrin really is. Is it a miracle drug or the socially acceptable form of crack or smack? I have developed a love/hate relationship with it at this point in my life. I love to take it and fell good and I hate to take it and feel weak for needing it. Straight up depression just blows. Too indescribable to an outsider about how it actually feels. "

898$Condition: Depression$3/5/2008 12:47:36 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$4$Before this medication I was absolutley a mess. I was crying almost everyday, on my days off from work I would lay on the couch and would not get up all day. I had stopped going out with friends, gained over 30 lbs, and overall just didn't care about anything. I decided it was time to take action and as much as I thought, oh this is a phase and I will snap out of it, I realized I couldn't do it on my own anymore. I started out at 150 mg and yes, there were side effects. I couldn't sleep at night, I lost my appettite (which I didn't mind), I was alot more anxious and kind of trembly, and I was sweating alot more and really thirsty. At first I was like, I can't do this, I work 12 hours a day I need sleep and food and, etc. These side effects lasted for about 2 months. For the sleeping issues I started taking this medication right when I woke up in the morning, about 5:30 am. I noticed that this helped me have more energy through the day and wore off toward the evenings but, still I was only sleeping like 4 hours a night. I started taking Xanax and Ambien, not together and not every night, but this helped alot. I have been on this medication for almost a year now, my doctor upped my dose to 300mg, I am soooo much more motivated, happy, and I have found me again.I have lost over 20 lbs and like I said this medicine gives me energy and the motivation to workout now and care about what I look like. The nervous, anxious, trembling feeling has gone away. I still sweat a little moe than usual and am thirsty but, it is not a major thing to me, I have adjusted. I would really recommend this mediaction to anyone who was having the symptoms of depression like I was. And, those symptoms weren't at certain times in the season or just every once in a while, yes they were worse during winter then summer. I was on a roller coaster of emotions up and down and I needed major help. Give this med. a try, ride out the side effects if you can, it is worth it in the end!!!!

BUT...I have a terrible time trying to sleep.  Even with taking a sleeping pill, I average 4-5 hours of sleep a night.  While I don't want to stop taking Wellbutrin, the insomnia is a real problem, and as of yet my doctor and I haven't found a way to overcome it. "

It takes the rough edge off and I am much nicer to be around.  I do have to watch my weight though, seems to have put some pounds on.

After 2 years of taking it I went to a new OB-GYN for my yearly and she inadvertantly changed me to Wellbutrin XL (it stays in your system twice as long as the SR). I didn't think anything of it as I am a RN and work in a pharmacy where the standard is the XL dose. After 3 1/2 to 4 months I started having blurry vision(I had LASIK 2 1/2 years ago), nausea, diarrhea, dizzyness, then anxiety, jittery, then shaky and rapid heart rate with missed beats. So bad that one day I clocked out and went to the ER. My heart was racing at 120-135 beats per minute. They sent me home on a Holter monitor to record my heart and it came back with frequent sinus tachycardia with occasional premature atrial and ventrical beats. Not realizing the drug switch, I was positive that my thyroid was out of wack. Had all the tests even changed doctors since I didn't think the first doc was doing enough. Finally I asked an eye doctor if Wellbutrin could be causing my vision problems and he told me to get it changed. I start a new medication in the morning, so we will see if it works for me.

It has changed my life.  Thank you Glaxo Smith Kline for creating such a wonderful drug.  I struggled with anxiety and feeling agitated about small, insignificant things all my life and now that is all gone.  One thing I will say is that I found a tremendous difference between the generic drug and the named brand drug.  I had severe mood swings while taking the generic.  You pay more for the named brand but maybe there is a reason for that. I love you Wellbutrin!!!

995$Condition: Depression$11/20/2007 2:39:14 PM$Reviewer: lovernotalearner, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I'd previously been on Effexor XL - side effects included weight gain and impotence.  After spending a year getting off of it, and another year trying to stay off of Anti-depressants altogether (cognitive therapy as alternative) I threw in the towel and sought 'something new' from healthcare provider.  Aside from forgetting to take it some days, I seem to tolerate it well.  I've not exactly been happy-go-lucky, but considering the despair I'd experienced during the preceding year, I feel it's been effective overall.  I'm not where I want to be yet, but I can conceive of 'getting there' - which is major progress in my book.

It does curb depression and make life more manageable.  I tried to get off of it twice, thinking I did not have depression anymore, but I do, and always will.  I am a generally happy person, and work on a lot of projects.  I can see the glass half full or half empty.  WellbutrinXL oral helps me see the glass half full.
I have tried several other anti-depressants, including one that is supposed to help for chronic pain.  That one had too many sexual side effects.  The other one had a weight gain factor.  One of them made me MORE depressed.  One made me tired.  WellbutrinXL oral allowed me to have energy, lose a small amount of weight, I had no sexual side effects, and was able to wake up in the morning.  It gave me more energy than the rest of them.  I am very happy with it, and would recommend it to a friend.  I even heard it helps people quit smoking."

I don't want those kinds of feelings to distract me from my life's work or from the people, places, activities, and things I believe are important toward my individual and societal integrity at my age (over 50).  So, my doctor put me on Lexapro with the generic Wellbutrin and the mania has stopped and the anxiety has diminished as well.  And I haven't had a cigarette in over three months!  Life is liveable again, and life is worth living again.  Balance and stability are real again.  I am real again.
