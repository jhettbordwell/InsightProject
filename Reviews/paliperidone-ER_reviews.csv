1$Condition: Schizophrenia With Mood Changes$9/24/2017 9:59:14 AM$Reviewer: HPS Amabael, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been on Paliperidone for about a month now and I was scared by other reviews about weight gain and other crazy side effects. I have actually had a suppressed appetite and lost 10.4 lbs. Medication does not work typically on me like others. I have so much less anxiety and my mood and voices are now under control. My suicidal ideation is pretty much gone. I started at 3 mg, but it wasn't effective until I got up to 9 mg. I have Schizoaffective disorder. This is the only medication that I feel is helping me cope. It was also a last resort because I've been on all of the old ""typical"" antipsychotics and the new ""atypicals."""
2$Condition: Schizophrenia With Mood Changes$2/23/2017 4:25:44 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$4$I have been on all the other antipsychotics and this one has helped me the best. I do not have hallucinations as much and my mood though is ok. Worst side effect though is the flat affect I have. But for the most part I would say this is the best one.
3$Condition: Schizophrenia With Mood Changes$5/10/2012 9:28:00 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$This medication has helped me so much. I have tried a few different meds ( like rispiridone) and itdidn't effect me as well. This has allowed me not to have the negative thoughts and feelings with a combination of celexa and depokote. This combination is the best for me. I am truly grateful to feel alot better these days.
