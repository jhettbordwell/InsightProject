2$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$1/23/2018 11:08:25 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$" This medicine by far has been the only medicine so far that my son has tried and has a significant impact his life . We have tried many many different medications and combinations and nothing has ever helped   With any significance this medicine has been a godsend !! 

 It allows him to think clear feel better and live his life every day in a good mood it also cuts down on his aggression by 95% !

 I finally see my son back and I havenâ€™t seen him in years and I owe them a lifetime of gradutudee , I pray it stays this way !"
3$Condition: Schizophrenia With Mood Changes$9/24/2017 9:59:14 AM$Reviewer: HPS Amabael, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been on Paliperidone for about a month now and I was scared by other reviews about weight gain and other crazy side effects. I have actually had a suppressed appetite and lost 10.4 lbs. Medication does not work typically on me like others. I have so much less anxiety and my mood and voices are now under control. My suicidal ideation is pretty much gone. I started at 3 mg, but it wasn't effective until I got up to 9 mg. I have Schizoaffective disorder. This is the only medication that I feel is helping me cope. It was also a last resort because I've been on all of the old ""typical"" antipsychotics and the new ""atypicals."""
4$Condition: Schizophrenia With Mood Changes$2/23/2017 4:25:44 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$4$I have been on all the other antipsychotics and this one has helped me the best. I do not have hallucinations as much and my mood though is ok. Worst side effect though is the flat affect I have. But for the most part I would say this is the best one.

8$Condition: Schizophrenia With Mood Changes$5/10/2012 9:28:00 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$This medication has helped me so much. I have tried a few different meds ( like rispiridone) and itdidn't effect me as well. This has allowed me not to have the negative thoughts and feelings with a combination of celexa and depokote. This combination is the best for me. I am truly grateful to feel alot better these days.

12$Condition: Other$8/16/2008 1:50:46 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$This medicine has worked very well for my mood regulation (bipolar type II and / or borderline personality dirorder & Schizoaffective (Schizioid / thinking along /w mood problems).  Mental illness, in some instances, is extremely hard to diagnose, and you may never know exactly what the diagnosis is.  It is best to try medicines in combinations untill you find what works.  I am using 6 mg of Invega, 1500 mg of Depakote ER, & 60 mg of Cymbalta.  I feel better than ever before.  Good luck..  Also, this is the best atypical antipsychotic, in my opinion, because of its efficacy (how well it works) & side effect profile (none that I've noticed besides low blood pressure which is actually a good thing in most instances)  They use special technology to allow the drug to be metabolized over a 24 hour period which is best for symptom control.  This is the most technologically advanced medicine right now.

First 2 days he was extremely hyper and confrontational. Days 3 and 4 were ok but seemed very subdued. Days 5 and 6 he was shaking extremely subdued and drowsy, and was even sent home from school.  Syptoms were like overdosage.
