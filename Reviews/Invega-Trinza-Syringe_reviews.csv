0$Condition: Schizophrenia$10/3/2019 5:06:46 PM$Reviewer: preussischer Kronprinz, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I had previously been on sustenna (1 month injection) for about 3 years when I switched to trinza (3 month injection) as soon as it was available. I've been on the trinza formulation for about a year. I'm happy with symptom control (no longer anger problems from paranoia etc.).  However, I do still have anxiety episodes about twice a week (thoughts of harm to self and others).
1$Condition: Schizophrenia$3/21/2019 10:15:15 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $2$2$4$My son did great on Invega Sustenna for 7 months, and his doctor moved him to the Invega Trinza. Unfortunately, it seems to have worn off after about a month and a half, and he's now supplementing with oral paliperidone and experiencing symptoms. He wants to go back t the Invega Sustenna because the Trinza has just not been as effective.
2$Condition: Schizophrenia$12/7/2017 10:42:11 PM$Reviewer: Tiredcaregiver, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) $4$1$5$My mother who is 69 has been on this for about a year and a half. She started having extreme side effects, muscle tremors, involuntary muscle movement, drooling, difficulty swallowing, weight loss, not being able to open a water bottle or any kind of bottle. I thought she had early signs of dementia no it was invega trenza. So upset it worked for her and the injections we're so convenient if you know anyone schizophrenic it's so hard to get them to take their medicine. I took her off the injection myself. It's not worth it she wasn't even driving anymore she forgot how and didn't have the motor skills to drive a stick or the muscle strength. The Dr now says it could take 4 months for side effects to get out of her system or they can just be permanent now. What kind of life is this for her and I the one that takes care of her. She's on a medicine that is for side effects from Parkinson's disease and that's helping her. Hopefully it's not permanent. There has to be some other way. She's worse off now than when she was having schizo symptoms. Now do we have to deal with all that and hallucinations, paranoia etc. I hope not.
