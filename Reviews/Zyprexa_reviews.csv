Rexulti worked great for my depression but is over $1000 a month, so my doctor prescribed zyprexa. Almost immediately after taking my first dose, I got super drowsy and fell asleep. The entire next day I felt like a zombie, I couldn't concentrate, and I wanted to just sleep all day. I had to leave work early just to go back to sleep, I was that out of it. The second time I took the dose, same thing happened. I'd rather be depressed than feel like I did on zyprexa"

In 9 months (at most!) I gained nearly 60 pounds which shifted my whole dwindling self esteem. 
This medication also greatly frustrated me because it just really did not help. I have severe OCD, it was so serious that doctors were convinced I was psychotic and had minor schizophrenia. So it honestly felt as though I was just taking a weight gain medication which made me extremely tired. 
I really recommend if you have OCD and your psychiatrist is suggesting this to go over very carefully how this medication will ease your symptoms and actually help your life. 
The only positive about this medication was that it was relatively easy to administer."

It works very quickly - the first day I took it, I started sleeping through the night. Racing and negative thoughts filtered out. My comment is, Zyprexa trumps everything - I always know I can take a full dose and the black pit of despair will close up almost instantly.  Having said that, it has significant side effects. Weight gain and tiredness are the main ones. It's sort of a Catch-22 since those things are rather depressing in and of themselves. I've been on it for about 15 years though and while the side effects are still an issue, they are more manageable. It increases sugar cravings, which makes staying on a healthy diet hard, but it is possible. (Weight Watchers diet has worked for me.). Because it's so powerful, I have been able to reduce the dose for periods of time, with reductions in weight and tiredness issues, but I have never been able to come all the way off it.  I guess I have a love-hate relationship with it. But if I'm depressed, I gain weight and feel sluggish anyway, so I'm no worse off.  For me, this drug was a miracle, but you need to be able to maintain a healthy diet and exercise, because the cravings

I also have body dysmorphic disorder. I am 23 years old taking prozac and Buspar. These medicines have helped me. But This medication has changed my life. It is awesome! I wish I have had it all of my life. I usually have racing thoughts/voices in my head every day. They are negative voices that tell me ""you're ugly, you're fat,  you're unattractive, nobody wants you, you should disappear, etc."" But this medicine helps more than anything to quiet those negative voices.But if you suffer every day,lIke I do I think this medicine might be good. I used to spend every hour suffering, fighting my thoughts. I couldn't even go into a store. But now don't care as much when I go places. I noticed I am more calm and positive.

My son gained over 60 pounds in a few months, his bp sky rocked, and he became diabetic  - just before he died of a fatal arrhythmia- supposedly due to sleep apnea.  This drug made my son unresponsive, lethargic, exacerbated his sleep apnea with weight gain and I believe eventually killed him.  Before my son passed I spoke to the APRN about taking him off of this drug, she just kept saying ""he has to be compliant"".  Where was her compliance with medical ethics? - she had never seen my son as a patient.  Now I read that there is a high probability that this drug causes arrhythmias.    "

My psychiatrist tried stopping this medication, but when this happened I had a certain mental reaction, with confusion in a part of my brain.  Finally I was able to get off Zyprexa, dropping it for Abilify, which at that time was being prescribed in large dosages, which was miserable (I've used Ability in the past few years, on a much lower dosage, which helped for awhile, but then wasn't effective), eventually I got off that by taking myself off against medical advice.  But the thing I noticed was that once I was off Zyprexa, my creativity improved dramatically and my life became so much more settled and happy.  Over the years I've talked to several medical people (including a psychiatrist), who said that my premise that Zyprexa caused me brain damage was possible.  I was just going through the extra stress of having dysthymia, a lower grade depression that lasts for years, back in 1997, but eventually my mental condition deteriated to the point that I had a major breakdown psychologically that caused me to eventually lose my job, and ended with about six years of terrible stress.  Maybe this was just a wrong drug for my mental illness, I don't know, but life has been tough over the years still, but with a brighter outlook.  A number of antidepressants and an antipsychotic definitely helped me stablize, along with counseling.

Mom has Lewy Body Dementia and for the first week or two it was like we got mom back!  After about a month on it mom developed contraindications.  She had been eating really well, then she started losing her appetite and began sleeping more. Suddenly one day she couldn't straighten up, she was bent sideways to the left, and  could not stay up straight.  Suddenly, she had fever, muscle pain, overall weakness, lethargy, loss of appetite, dehydration, confusion, and inability to speak coherently.  At first, I thought mom had the flu, then I read the contraindications.  This med is not indicated for my mom, so I don't know if it is her physical make up, the disease itself or that the drug is not applicable. Whatever the reason, this med is not indicated for psychosis with the elderly.  Mom has dementia, so I don't know if there may be some physiological relationship.

In the beginning it helped me tremendously and helped me to maintain a steady job and life for about 7 years on the drug.  I did not put on the weight gain that others seem to have a problem with.  However, please note that it makes you want to sleep 10-12 hours a day and if I got any less than that during the night I would have to make up for it with a 2-3 hour nap in the afternoon or evening!  Recently I had to stop taking zyprexa since it seems to not be working anymore to manage my bipolar symptoms.  Even worse, I think it has exacerbated sleep apnea syndrome where I am not able to breathe properly or at all for periods of time at night, which makes me wake up in the middle of the night for many many moments at a time.  This really wreaks havoc on your sleep cycle and sleep quality!  Overall, I would say that try this medication if you must of if your psychiatrist recommends this but beware of the long-term side effects that they may not be too aware of and may not be published when this drug was first released to the public.  Hope this helps!

The first day my dose was too strong and I slept for 30 hours. I fixed my dose but I still gained an annoying amount of weight. But honestly the worst part was planning my entire life around when I would be able to basically pass out for 10 hours. It is good for dire crisis situations. When I got off it I had a suicidal episode and felt completely worthless. Worse than any of the lows in my depression.

I started taking zyprexa in '99 (to the present day) for years of sleep deprivation, wasn't feeling myself, etc. It soon started to help me sleep & dream (REM) -- which was nice, although I did gain 50 pounds in a year or 2.  Around 2001, I began having trouble with stuttering (speech) -- talking is extremely difficult now; sleep apnea (I go into respiratory arrest while asleep and have to tell myself to breathe/inhale when I wake up with oxygen deprivation in my brain--feels like a near death experience); and also some numbness/stroke like symptoms.

I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced any similar (neurological) symptoms while on zyprexa.  I would also LOVE to file a lawsuit against Eli Lilly for damages, but getting medical & scientific proof linking the zyprexa to the symptoms I experience is difficult, if not impossible.

BTW.....here's a pharmaceutical cost tidbit for you.  When I started taking zyprexa in 1999, it cost $6.00 per tablet (retail).  Twelve years later, it now costs more than double per tablet retail....thank goodness for insurance, but just goes to show how much Eli Lilly loves to profit from this.  Also, in case you haven't heard, the patent on zyprexa expires in 2012.

I never thought I needed the drug but my doctors pushed it and not knowing any better I complied. I had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and drugged unbelieveably up to the point where I couldnt feel, think or relate to others. I slept all day everyday and gained 70 pds. I thought "" is this what i want from my life?"" Slowly I weaned off the Zyprexa and Celexa and others and stayed on the lithium since its a salt not a drug. learning that my asshole father pressured the doctors all these years to keep me sedated b/c of his sexual abuse to me. Ive been good so far. Trouble sleeping but it gets better. Im under therapy and still see a doctor but I have a second chance in life. If you think something is wrong and doesnt feel right it usually is. Dont wait for that second chance that will never come. Do something about it!"

I started taking zyprexa in '99 (to the present day) for years of sleep deprivation, wasn't feeling myself, etc. It soon started to help me sleep & dream (REM) -- which was nice, although I did gain 50 pounds in a year or 2.  Around 2001, I began having trouble with stuttering (speech) -- talking is extremely difficult now; sleep apnea episodes (I go into respiratory arrest while asleep and have to tell myself to breathe/inhale when I wake up with oxygen deprivation in my brain--feels like a near death experience); and also some numbness/stroke like symptoms.

I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced any similar (neurological) symptoms while on zyprexa.  I would also LOVE to file a lawsuit against Eli Lilly for damages, but getting medical & scientific proof linking the zyprexa to the symptoms I experience is difficult, if not impossible.

BTW.....here's a pharmaceutical cost tidbit for you.  When I started taking zyprexa in 1999, it cost $6.00 per tablet (retail).  Twelve years later, it now costs $15.00 per tablet retail....thank goodness for insurance, but just goes to show how much Eli Lilly loves to profit from this.  Also, in case you haven't heard, the patent on zyprexa expires soon.

My (now EX) wife took me some quack that handed this posion out like it was candy.  I gained 90 pounds in 6 months and was reduced to a zombie that slept 14-16 hours a day.  The panic attacks that the drug was supposed to be preventing actually got far worse and started happening in my sleep.  I went off the drug AMA and detoxing from it was hellish.  A year later I still have the occasional mild panic attack which I just deal with as best I can.  The weight almost fell off me, I'm back around 200 a year later and I was pushing 300.  This is a very powerful drug that I suppose may help people but it should only be used by people that are very, very ill.

As a petite woman (I'm only 4'10) this has been devastating! The medication definitely helped with my anxiety, but it caused me to be in a constant 'blank' state,  little to no emotions or feelings. I felt tired all the time and felt as though I needed to sleep constantly. I stopped taking the medication on my own, against my doctor's recommendation. Coming off the med was difficult, in the first week after discontinuing I felt more emotionally unstable than I ever have in my life, much more so than before I began the medication. It's been over a month since I quit taking it, and even though I'm working out 4 days a week and eating an extremely low calorie & low carb diet the weight is not coming off! I'm beginning to worry that this medicine has somehow caused me permanent obesity! I will say that this may be an effective medicine for someone in an extreme crises situation, or in such a severe manic state that they're willing to gain weight and possibly destroy their body in exchange for stabilizing their mood, as it does ""work"" in the sense that it prevents one from feeling just about anything!

The first dose obliterated obsessions, racing thoughts, and severe insomnia.  The day after was completely different from the day before.  OTOH I had the problems others had mentioned -- sluggishness and food cravings leading to weight gain.  The weight problems are a Catch-22 with me because I gain weight when I am depressed, and while I'm not depressed with Zyprexa, it leads to weight gain.  But I have been able to lose weight while on Zyprexa, and it's only on Zyprexa that I seem to have the will to do it.  That will continue to be a battle.  I've been off it and on it, and would love to find something that works as well without the side effects, but so far no luck.

A complete 180 from the 'me' before! It's been a true life-saver for me! I have been on a large variety of meds and was very frustrated! My MD was talking about ECT.

148$Condition: Schizophrenia$5/15/2011 8:35:50 AM$Reviewer: KimUri, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$2$I was falsely diagnosed as schizophrenic due to some issues back in High school, but was forced to either take this or be submitted to the hospital. While on it, I gained 20lbs, nearly strangled my sister to death, and hallucinated some of the most horrifying things I have ever saw in my life. If you do not have the psychosis a medication is meant to help fix, DO NOT take it, regardless of legal issues as its side effects will outlast any legal trouble. It's a small pill, so not hard to swallow, but not only made my depression worse, but it put me through some of the most horrifying times of my life. Between the hallucinations I saw (even knowing it wasn't real barely helped) and the fact I was barely able to control myself from killing someone while on this medication, I advise any and everyone to stay as far away from this medication as possible. I don't know if it actually works for people who ACTUALLY have schizophrenia or not, but if you don't, you'll know after only a couple doses that this medication is not for you. Also note, the hallucinations last far after you quit taking the medication... thankfully the blind rage did not. Please be careful when on any anti-psychotic medication, especially Zyprexa or any form of this specific medication.

151$Condition: Other$4/24/2011 4:13:37 PM$Reviewer: donteatit, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years$1$1$1$"The only reason I wanted on this drug was because  thought it might have a less intensly unpleasant spectrum of side effects. Early on this seemed so until the pain under my ribs developed. I associate this with overeating due to my nervous system being unable to properly process the message that my nutritional needs were satisfied and the subsequent overeating and even doubling the meal at times.  
   I was unable to stop taking this medication not only because of the acute rebound effect of rapid cessation but that I was being monitored and would be rendered homeless and jobless for non compliance.  RESULT= B.O.L.O. and restraint for depot injections.   
   At great risk I slowly over the course of months lessened my intake. Discovery of my plan might have resulted in an even more damaging experience with Prolixin IM depot injections. (potentially deadly)
   The less Zyprexa I was on the more the doctor seemed to think it was the right thing for me.  Finally after razor shaving the pills for months I told him that I was almost off them.  I was able to convince him that I should be off them but then he transferred my case to one of his students with whom he was sharing a practice and she began torturing me with a different psychiatric chemical.I did the same thing with her only I didnt reveal the truth until I was off the poison for months. 

These people truely have no idea what they are doing. They are being paid for confidence in a scattershot approach that they are willing to stubbornly defend in court even though the motivation is monetary more than altruistic. 
At one point I was being treated  ""for prophalaxis""  Thats a lot like wearing a raincoat in the desert just because it might rain later.
   Wall street needs a dose of its own medicine and I have every right to bill them for both manufacturing it and eating it.  How ironic that I actually worked AT LILLY as an employee of an outside  contractor while on this poison.

That was about eight years ago. In that time i have gained over 50 pounds when i was always proper weight before and i noticed i am tired more often ,so i take it at night.

The Lithium that I had been taking for 3+ years was no longer sufficently effective, so my dr. added Zyprexa to treat the ""breakthrough"" symptoms. And IT DID! Zyprexa is wonderful for the mind, but wreaks havoc on the body!! HUGE appetite increase - craved food all the time. I gained 50 lbs in 6 months & became very depressed about my body, of course...I went from 120 lbs to 170! I have been off of Zyprexa for 3 months and lost 10 lbs, and I can't believe I have 40 more to go. Wish I had never taken Zyprexa!! "

My 75 yr old mother began taking Zyprexa 2 yrs ago and at the time it was amazingly successful.  It still is...somewhat.  Several months ago she began having tremors and they are progressively worse now.  She has also developed diabetes, diabetes related heard disease, has had seizures (had the disorder prior), high cholesterol ... but hasn't gained a pound. I am terribly concerned because some of the precautions I have read online indicate the tremors may not subside after stopping the meds.  You would think she had Parkinsons (and may - MRI pending). 

I am terrified to take her off Zyprexa because of her state of mind.  But, I'm also terrified to leave her on the drug.  It's a double edge sword for me.  I think some people will do well on this drug...but others will not.  Everyone has to try it for themselves.  Best of luck to everyone.    "

I have had no side effects and the medication has worked well with my other medications.  I would also strongly recommend that often times have to give psychiatric drugs 8-12 weeks before they reach a therapeutic level to even work, so give them a chance.  Additionally, don't expect everything from your medications; you should also be involved in counseling and group therapy for an adequate time ( I still go regularly to a psychiatrist and to a therapist) to better help you understand whatever disorder you've been diagnosed with and help you cope with the challenges that go along with it.

Since, he has lost 40 pounds and sleeps all day and is restless at night. He has diabetes and his sugar is all messed up, vision problems, tremors, nervous agitation, depressed badly to the point of constantly talking about suicide. His dose is small and 1x @ night. He felt better before taking this medicine and I have noticed his well being sinking rapidly. His doctor still feels this is the best medicine for him. I disagree. Time for a new doctor before this one kills my man.
240$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$1/16/2010 1:44:23 AM$Reviewer: hazeldeluxe, 25-34 Female  (Patient) $1$1$4$Taking this medication was the most awful experience I ever had, it was the first rx I was given after the diagnosis of Bipolar.  I had been on antidepressants for most of my life starting in 7th grade all to no avail, so when I got the diagnosis of the more severe mental illness, I was actually relieved.  So I started the program and continued the full course to make sure I gave it a fair chance to have the desired effect. I was at work one day and the thought crossed my mind that I might want to kill myself but I blew it off, then the idea came back and I started to take it serious like planning my demise. I've struggled with stuff most of my life and wished I was dead but I never would've taken my own life, because I actually have always had a nice life.  I think there is a difference between wanting to die and planning a suicide.  Zyprexa completely rewired my brian, I stayed on it for 4 months. I was on suicide watch and was moments away from being checked into the psych ward, my friends were genuinely concerned, in a way they had never been before. I became a different person entirely.  The doctor that gave me the script was a quack but that is another story.  Taking this med is my very biggest regret still today. The only good thing is that I am back to normal, except when I have a flashback, usually around the time of year, the anniversary, of the disaster.

I've been on every anti depressant there is, as well as anti anxiety drugs, other anti psychotics and well, just about anything you can name. I would say that added to my anti depressant regime, this drug has solved all the problems, I should also note that years ago I was one risperidone with also excellent results. The downsides for me have not been weight gain, I actually have not gained a single pound on this medication, I am very careful how I eat and try to stick to 3 meals a day, and stick to small portions for lunch and dinner, I have horses and am quite active, this all helps to keep me in shape. The downside has been an incredible thirst, I'm drinking a lot of water, this drug has me really thirsty. I just had a med review with my doctor today and am going down from 10 mg 1x a day to 5mg 1x a day, hopefully this will help reduce what seems like a perpetual dry mouth. Bottom line for me is this drug has been a real winner for me, no more irrational thoughts, no more constant gloom. I don't know about being on this drug for years and years, I'll leave that to you and your doctor.

I would have stayed on it long term, but within a short amount of time, I gained 30 lbs. I am very active and do cardio and weights daily but I was so hungry on this med, although I ate healthy, I still gained weight. I also experience a very weak tired feeling which only added to the weight gain. If you can deal with the weight, it is a great medication.

I was given this drug to treat what my PC diagnosed as depression.  Without even realizing it I had slowly but steadily been sliding deeper into depression. I began going to bed very early and sleeping until 11 am, stopped dressing and keeping up with my daily grooming. My family and I were suffering. I began using Zyprexa recently and those close to me that don't even know that I began a new medication have commented how much more ""alive"" I seem. I am in a better mood, laughing more, joking around, sleeping less and dressing up more. Up til now I have not experienced any hyperactivity, no weight gain, and no sedation. Knock on wood. I would recommend this to anyone who has tried other meds with little result. You may just be as surprised as I was."

I was slightly overweight (160) when I started taking this drug. Lately, I gained 65 lbs. My doctor put me on Lasix to get the water weight off. I initially lost 11 lbs., but I fear that I can't get any more of the weight off. With my many health problems, I decided to stop taking Zyprexa, tapering it down slowly. I can't risk my life any more than it already is. The swelling, or pitting it is called by the Medical Professional, is very dangerous.  So, I WILL NOT EVER take this medication again, even though it helped my Manic Depression. Good luck to all of you.

If you are experiencing a major trauma in your life or a major manic episode that you just can't seem to deal with on your own, this is your medication! It works wonders! I've tried quite a number of meds for their tranquil effectiveness and none work like this one.

BE WARNED, HOWEVER! YOUR WEIGHT GAIN WILL BE MASSIVE!!! The feeling is great, but the cravings are uncontrollable! I gained about 10 lbs.in 3 weeks. I recommend it only be used short term. And when I say short term, I mean only stay on it long enough to get over whatever it is you are currently experiencing. As soon as you feel better, you should ask your doctor about switching to another drug.

Zyprexa has redeeming qualities due to its tranquilizing and dulling effect. You will be so ""zoned out"" (for lack of better words), you won't care about anything. This can work for you or against you; depending on how you look at it. This feeling of euphoria also validates my point about this medication being effective if you are going through a severe traumatic situation and you're prone to having manic episodes.

All in all, I would recommend Zyprexa for short term use only. Discuss other options with your PDOC as you will gain 5 pounds just filling the prescription for this one!"

However, like all things in life, you need to manage it. I maintain a healthy diet, and exercise regularly. I drink in moderation contrary to some advice. I've recently been informed I have an 'elevated level of cholesterol' which may be a result of some weight gain - however my GP assessed me recently and no cause for concern on my weight (I'm 80Kg and 178cm). I'm not one try other options to Zyprexa as it's worked for me in terms of my mental health issues - with which I cope very well now. At this stage I'm used to feeling well - compared to how I felt prior to using this medication. Taking Zyprexa is only one element of recovery - and it may take other treatments such as counselling etc Be positive, be curious, be patient...good luck and enjoy life !

The doctor said it's from the Zyprexa and is probably a permanent side effect. My mom has early Alzheimer's and also experienced hallucinations. Also, paranoid. She went on Zyprexa approx. 2 years ago. It helped with the hallucinations, but all other symptoms are still difficult. She's only 63 and now she may have Parkinson's symptoms to deal with on top of everything else. I will follow up with a Neurologist to see what we can do.

It immediately calmed me down, helped me get my anxiety under control, and I finally could sleep for more than four hours.

The reason for the high dissatisfaction is first, I was sleepy ALL THE TIME.  I went from four hours sleep to 12 or more hours sleep, and even after all that I was still sleepy.

I had a long commute to work, and there were several incidents where I almost crashed into the interstate divider.

In addition to the sleepiness, I became a food hog.  I ate, ate, ate and ate, and after all that still ate.  I ballooned from 190 lbs to 250 lbs in less than a year.

It is a good drug for bi-polar, and if it were a choice between bi-polar and a better life, and if Zyprexa was all that there was, I would go with it.  Plus, these issue may not be typical for everyone.

I no longer take the drug, and I have not for several years.  I take Lamictal now, and I am back down to 190 lbs.

I hope this review helps."

I have learned (the hard way) that I am very sensitive to anti-dopamine drugs such as Zyprexa, so what I say here won't apply to everybody.

In any event, I got the drug to combat major depression as well as frequent mood swings that felt like the hypomania of Bipolar-II disorder.

Unfortunately, my treatment ended up a disaster (your experience will vary).  I had hypoglycemia occasionally as a kid, and this medication (taken when I was 21) brought it back.

The worst side effect, though, was ""akathisia"" (an incredibly horrific sense of anxiety; time seems to slow to a stop and you can't stop yourself from pacing around the place).  Akathisia isn't too common with this drug (as compared to even other newer antipsychotics, such as Abilify/aripiprazole), but it hit me hard with Zyprexa personally.

Overall, I would not recommend this drug to anybody who has had a bad reaction to other sedating antipsychotics (such as Seroquel/quetiapine), whether the negative reaction was blood sugar issues or akathisia.

However, Zyprexa's mild sedation (not as bad as Seroquel's or that of the older antipsychotics) will help a lot of people who are willing to put up with the blood sugar issues. 

But for me? It was a total disaster.

It made me go from a frustrated, emotional mess who was ruining her marriage to being someone who was actually relatively pleasant to be around.  Any other medication I tried resulted in nasty side effects which I couldn't tolerate.  This medication initially caused drowsiness in the mornings after the night I took it, but that went away after a couple months.  Also, I did gain some weight - but it was worth it to finally have some relief for me and my family.

I gained 50 pounds in 5 and a half years before I was finally taken off of it. I've been completely off of it for less than 2 weeks, and I've already lost at least 10 pounds. I didn't mind sleeping all the time. I kinda liked it, but I knew that 12 to 18 hours a night wasn't normal. Zyprexa kinda deadened my emotions, but I didn't mind. The numbness was better than the pain. It really did help me, but I couldn't keep gaining weight. I am 5 foot 3 inches and weighed 160 pounds, compared to 110 or less when I started. It really put stress on my body.

I go through episodes where I get non-stop anxiety so bad that I can't sleep at all, one big adrenaline rush.  This is the only medication I've used that's helped.  I've been struggling for 13 years with this and after a half hour of taking the first dose I was able to lay back on the couch and just breath and relax.  When I'd fall asleep is was really deep (which, made me groggy in the morning it was so deep... but that was far better than the alternative).  I've read a lot of bad reviews on weight gain, so I made sure not to over-eat even if hungry on it (I didn't have any large hunger changes).  However, I also only took it for 7 days at the most.  Now, when I feel an episode come on, I take it for 1-2 nights and it's succesfully stopped me from having that episode go farther.  

I'm still nervous to use it because of what I've read, but my experience with it has been good with how I am using it (low dose, short periods).  "

I have seen too many children in the hospital with medicines that don't work and they have such bad side effects on them they should be banned unless they can prove they help and individual.  I want to warn parents alot of kids can't handle these drugs.  Make sure your doctor really knows your kids before they put medicine in them and don't let them try high doses.

That is the one ""benefit?"" I did get, was solid sleep; I became almost semi comatose in addition to quickly gaining
50 lbs on my 5'5"" body resulting in a deepening of my depression & several serious suicide attempts. Zyprexa IS helpful in individual cases,but not mine.

I started to educate myself and advocate for myself, became a partner in my treatment.  

I still take medications, always will. I've had one suicidal attempt while off Zyprexa, my weight is an acceptable 145 lbs and most of the time I am living a reasonably good, tolerable and informed life.

Don't give up hope!  Don't stop taking your meds! Don't stop learning! It's your responsible way of finding out about yourself & what fits you best plus how to express it! Defend your right to know about your health care treatment, it is imperative.

I didn't mean to lecture.  I felt it necessary to tell my story, in and out of symtoms, with and without Zyprexa. It led me on my path of discovery in my own health treatment and remissions.

I have tried to stop taking this drug several times but was threatened to be put back into the mental unit.  I asked for a different medication several times but to no avail.

I go to sleep carelessly and easily but feel ""hungover"" and groggy thew next day, usually oversleeping and having trouble waking up for the next 4 to 6 hours."

I started off with a small dose (this has been over a year ago) then worked up to the (i believe) 25 mg tablet. I gained over 40 pounds in about 3 months, I slept about 14 hours a day. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't clean my house or play with my son. I had NO energy, it was all I could do to just get up in the morning to go to work. My work performance dropped tremendously, but I couldn't help it. I was severly over medicated and didn't even notice until I took myself off the med. I will not allow my doctor to put me on anything else now because I am terrified that this will happen again with something else. I will deal with my problems on a day to day basis now. I would not recommend this medication to anyone but hopefully someone else would not have to deal with this. As for the weight gain as soon as I came off the med I lost back down to my normal size, so I know this was from the zyprexa.

I took the medicine for 3 weeks.  I had to discontinue use because of the terrible side effects it caused for me.

It was a little rough at first. Made me a little slugish.  I was taking 7.5mg a day.  It worked really well for me but I had to stop because I gained almost 40lbs in less than two months!  I was really fit, so it was very obvious that I gained it.  Plus everyone felt the need to tell me how chunky I had become. Plus that much weight so fast is not healthy.  I really wish it didn't have that side effect because it worked pretty good.  After a few other meds that didn't work, I am currently on Seroquel 400mg. It didn't make me gain weight at first at smaller doses, but they weren't effective. But now at 400 I've gained almost 40lbs in the last three months. I gained alot on Zyprexa, then lost it all on Geodon (worst one I've ever been on!)  But now I'm back up to where I left off with Zyprexa.  I do feel better, but I can't deal with the gain. I will be discussing this at my next appointment. But all in all the Zyprexa was great other then that side effect.

He has most of the side effects of the drug. He falls, is confused, very week, disoriented,dizzy,lazy eyes, quivers,nervous, anxious, hungry, cannot speak, etc. I think they give zyprexa to make it easier for the staff, as the clients turn into vegetables and easier to manage.

374$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$11/6/2008 12:58:19 AM$Reviewer: BW, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$I also take Lexapro for depression, which has worked great in the past. But during this trial, I was still depressed and ABSOLUTELY could not sleep. I dabbled with many sleep aids but many actually stimulated me or the side effects were too much, or would make me more depressed. I began by taking this to sleep and help with the depression. I took 5mg. I fell right to sleep and awoke 10 hours later. I woke up feeling quite refreshed. I was not tired the next day, and HAD NO DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, which had effected every part of my life for months prior. It worked excellent with Lexapro for my mood, thought process and motivation. I felt amazing, but not drugged, very energized and content. But, I would not stop eating. I have always been able to keep plenty of food and snacks in the house, without temptation to over eat. However, this day was much different. I could not stop eating. I LITERALLY COULD NOT STOP EATING. No matter how full I was, I still COULD NOT STOP EATING. I swore every snack/meal was my last, yet before I knew it, I was eating again, still full. Yet I did not feel nausious like I always have in the past when I had over eaten. I could just eat, and eat and eat. At the end of the day, still snacking and eating, I tallied some of the things I had eatin, and realized I had well exceeded 5000 calories! Amazing, from a person that comfortably eats 2000-3000 calories a day. The next evening i took 2.5mg. But the day after was no different than the one before. I stopped taking it and it took 3-4 days for the habitual eating to start to go away. I took 5mg a week later, with the same gloriously amazing effects on my mood. But it had the same horrific effect on my eating consumption, which took another 3-4 days to begin wearing off. Being overweight is one of the most depressing, uncomfortable and unhealthy things in the world, so why would anyone take this for ANY REASON. DO NOT TAKE THIS. Its comparable to heroin feels great but isnt worth TheSideEffects.

I have a love hate relationship with Zyprexa. I love what it does for my OCD making it very manageable along with improving my depression. Zoloft stopped doing the job by itself and this was added.  That being said, I hate the 40 pound weight gain (now 100 pounds overweight), high cholesterol (never a problem before), and high blood sugar (never a problem before). In addition, in the beginning it makes you very drowsy. I have fallen asleep at my desk at work more than a few times. I take 5mg twice daily. I just finished a trial of Celexa without success. Prozac is next on the list to try and get me off of Zyprexa.

Through faith in God and through reading the Bible I have been blessed to obtain a Bachelor's Degree and maintain regular employment with the government. Things haven't always been easy. I've gained alot of weight, but the weight I've gained is minor in comparison to the life I've been able to live. I have also been blessed to not get diabetes. Sometimes things are so good for me that if a person didn't know me personally, they would never know that I had the disease.  God has been so good to me. I recommend Jesus for every situation.

She was put back on Zyprexa and will have to stay on it for the rest of her life. She has been stable since then but tying to come off of it is scary.

Here is the deal with Zyprexa: Now, I am no psychiatrist (although I feel like one after experimenting with different medications for the past 18 months), but, after a great deal of research and personal experience, I can safely say that Zyprexa is the most efficacious anti-psychotic on the market.  HOWEVER, you will gain a ton of weight (which could lead to diabetes and other related problems) if you are not careful.  I am a former athlete, and I exercise for at least an hour every day, and I put on about 20 lbs. while taking this drug.  From what I understand, most people put on much more than that!  So, essentially, Zyprexa is the best drug for schizophrenia (even better than Haldol and the other first generation drugs); however, the side effects can be very serious.  I advise carefully considering your diet/exercise routine before beginning to take this drug.  Simply put, it is the most efficacious anti-psychotic out there...just be careful.

He had been hospitalized for several weeks prior to the ICU stay and was anxious and  confused about place and time of stay. He was anxious, and with ongoing anxiety his O2 level usually fell into the 70s. His CO2 level was in the 60%ile, an acceptable level for his condition, according to the treating pulmonologist. He was also given antibiotics for his pneumonia and MRSA as well as another hospital acquired bacterium (I do not recall the name but think the nurses just called it by two letters, such as ""Po""). Doctors were trying to stabilize his O2 levels. Shortly after the new medication, Zyprexa, my husband showed symptoms of psychosis. He had terrible nightmares that he took for reality and was still more confused over place and time. Inspite of it, he always recognized his family members. Per my request, the Zyprexa was removed. After three days, he no longer had nightmares and realized that some of the dreams were just dreams and place and time were reality again.

453$Condition: Other$11/3/2007 2:27:23 AM$Reviewer: CMD, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$5$I have Schizo-Affective Disorder, basically Bipolar II with regular psychotic symptoms. I was on 10mg Zyprexa daily with Lithium Carbonate, Lamictal and Wellbutrin. I was moved to Zyprexa 2 years ago after Abilify stopped working and landed me in a mental ward. The Zyprexa controlled my psychotic symptoms very well. I still had occasional intrusive thoughts, but almost no hallucinations or irrational reactions. With the mood elevators I was on, I did not have the emotional problems that others talk about. I did experience some loss of higher intellectual function. This was shown clearly by decreased performance on standardized tests. The real problem was the weight gain. I had serious appetite control problems. I even ended 7.5 years of vegetarianism because I couldn't control my cravings for high-calorie foods. I gained 60 pounds in the first 7 months or so that I was on the drug. I wasn't exactly thin to begin with. With deliberate effort, I was able to stabilize at that point. In the last 6 months, with a lot of effort, I managed to lose just 9 pounds. Being fat caused me to develop sleep apnea, from which I may never recover. Between that and the Zyprexa, I was tired a lot. I couldn't get up early one morning a week to consistently make my psychotherapy appointments, causing me to stop them. My sleep MD, with consent from my psychiatrist, put me on Provigil, which helped a lot, but that was only a couple weeks before I stopped Zyprexa.  I do suggest it, but I can't talk about it as a long term solution. I switched from Zyprexa to Geodon 18 days ago. I am not even close to sleepy. My mood has improved. I have taken firm control of my eating. I lost over 6 pounds the first 2 weeks I was off it, because I am now able to stick to a healthy, low-calorie diet. I even feel some of the intellectual function coming back.  Zyprexa was effective, but living with the long term effects was just too much.  It helped when I really needed control.  I should have stopped sooner.

466$Condition: Manic-Depression$10/4/2007 1:22:04 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$2$4$Prescribed in combination with Depakote and Zyprexa after one visit to the doctor.  The combination made me feel heinous: worthless, emotionless, apathetic.   Although, Zyprexa itself was given to me to aid sleep... which it did... a little too well.  I would caution to try diet and exercise first! I don't take any medication now, and I stopped myself.  Training and nutrition has taken care of the problems.
467$Condition: Bipolar Disorder in Remission$9/29/2007 2:26:08 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$3$The Zyprexa changed my metabolism and I gained over 100 pounds.  It gave me high blood pressure and cholesterol. This is a dangerous, addictive medication that should not be on the market.  The benefits do not outweigh the risks.
468$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$9/25/2007 7:39:07 AM$Reviewer: rowan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$1$4$I took this drug for four years.  Although it lessen the anxiety and panic attacks, the side-effects became intolerable.  I slept sometimes as much as 14 hours a day at times and my appetite became something out of control.  I was eating like a starving dog and I gained 75 pounds in less than a year,  my blood pressure went up, and I was retaining water which caused me to have a bloated and shiny-skinned appearance. I have a photo from back then and I looked very un-well.  But I kept on it because my doctor said there was nothing in that class of drugs which I hadn't been already on and had experienced unacceptable side-effects.  Si I took it.  Then late last year the panic attacks and all of the rest of the nightmare came crashing on top of me. I felt psychotic and terrified of what I might do to myself. I had to make an emergency appointment with my doctor and I was in hospital within the hour.  I was weaned off the zyprexa and in hospital for nearly a month.  I am finally beginning to lose the excess weight.  I am on enirely different medication.  Every medication is not the same for everyone, I know, but I don't recommend zyprexa.
