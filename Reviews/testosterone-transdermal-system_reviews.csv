8$Condition: Other$8/30/2009 11:45:52 PM$Reviewer: Bud, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$5$5$"I'm 53 (single, heterosexual) with metabolic syndrome and sleep apnea, had very low energy.  Free testosterone was at the lowest ""normal"" for my age.  After 9 months TRT my energy is better, my need for 12+ hours sleep is down to a more normal 8, I've lost weight and gone off Effexor.  And I often wake up with an erection which I hadn't noticed hadn't happened in a while (maybe years).  Pharmacist cautioned to take antioxidants to prevent testosterone oxidizing to estrogen or progesterone in vitro (I forget which one) which often leads men to quit testosterone replacement therapy because it makes their symptoms worse.  This includes supplemental zinc and selenium.  Also test early in therapy to make sure testosterone level doesn't go above normal; this can cause unwanted aggressive impulses.  Finally, it takes time for this therapy to start working, a few months, at least."
