I've been taking Welbutrin for 28 days and I feel worse than I have ever felt in my life.  I will stick with it for the 6 weeks that my doctor has suggested I try, but this experience has been horrible.  I'm fortunate in that I am retired and can take the time I need to concentrate on my mental health.

6$Condition: Depression$5/13/2019 11:21:16 PM$Reviewer: thankful, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been taking 300mg of Bupropion XL (the generic form of Wellbutrin XL) for four years and I have to say this medicine has saved my life. Before I started Bupropion, I had had five depressive episodes in four years; I have not had a depressive episode since I began taking Bupropion four years ago. I can feel happy again and I can laugh. I am able to feel sadness, but it doesn't overwhelm me. I am not drowning in self-loathing anymore. I am myself again and I have been myself for four years. As far as negative side-effects are concerned, I will have a migraine if I accidentally skipped a dose the day before. It also took a while to kick in. The first two weeks were difficult because my brain would go ""offline"" in the afternoon and I wouldn't be able to do anything until my brain ""restarted"" later in the evening. This pattern lasted for a few weeks. The first month was pretty terrible, though there were glimmers that things were changing; I would feel less awful than usual for ten minutes every few days. The second month was a little better; I was able to feel happy for an entire hour one day and could generally enjoy things more. Week nine was when I had five whole good days where I could feel happy any time I wanted all day long. Week ten was when everything took off and I started feeling like myself again. Four years later, this medication still works for me. I have been able to get back on my feet and rebuild my life after my depression because the chemicals in my brain are working for me and not against me. I feel good. I can feel good whenever I want. I'm not held captive by depression anymore. Bupropion made all of that possible."

Am at 300mg and I feel like I have my life back. Am energetic, engaged and overall just present in life! Its been amazing, this has truly been the only thing that has worked! And am thankful my Doc recommended it. If you have the same results as me you won't regret it. Lastly, if you drink tons of caffine, it might make you slightly hand shaky but totally worth it. 
11$Condition: Other$3/10/2019 11:57:01 PM$Reviewer: Brandy.boop., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken Wellbutrin for years- off and on. I started out as most do, a low dose. I gradually increased every few years, because I still just didn’t feel right. I had gotten to the max dosage of 300mg for depression, and felt good for a while, but still just not great- I don’t know if that makes much sense. I finally went in to discuss ADHD. My youngest daughter had just been diagnosed, and research led me to have an “ah ha” moment. About 6 weeks ago my pcp bumped me to 450mg. Seems like a lot, I know, but for ADHD it’s not. I have felt so much more clear headed. I don’t feel sad or down. I don’t feel overwhelmed and scatter brained. I feel great. My binge eating has taken a hike, and my appetite is that of a normal person. I have actually lost ten pounds from my January 18 appt to my March 4 appt. I couldn’t be more thrilled! I am a mother of girls who I keep in activities, dog mom, a full time medical assistant, a student, and a wife. I was overwhelmed before, with my schedule and life. I am so busy, all the time, but now I feel great and  I wouldn’t have it any other way!

I'd also recently lost 75 pounds and was afraid of regaining. I started the meds and smoked for about a week.  When I ran out of cigarettes I quit.  It worked like a light switch.  I never picked up another cigarette. Sept was 4 years as a non-smoker. I kept taking Wellbutrin for a year after I quit. I didn't gain any weight, never wanted to smoke--just didn't have any desire to. Also, I wasn't any crankier than normal. I know it won't work for everybody, but it was magic for me. Being a non-smoker has saved my health, and literally over $20,000. I'm grateful."

I'm back on it and doing so much better, even after 2 days.  This medicine is just such a good antidepressant.

The depression feeds into my anxiety.  I am a low starting dose.  I am concerned about my blood pressure, but it hasn't noticably risen.  Part of my issue may have been working remotely with little to no human interaction whilst my better half goes to work.  That said, I am not as anxious these days.  I even started traveling for business again and it is painless!  I feel the need to exercise somewhat regularly again!  I sweated two days in a row and actually jogged on the treadmill! I can't say that I have lost any appreciable weight, but I feel ""lighter"" in mood and actually want to do things.  I may have incorrectly attributed my depression to being an introvert and vice versa.  I do really like people even thought they (except for really good friends) drain my energy reserves."

21$Condition: Depression$2/7/2018 2:00:53 AM$Reviewer: ScreenNamePerson, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I was suicidal (didn't want to wake up, began to consider suicide, every day was arduous, couldn't eat, socializing was difficult, loss of enjoyment of anything, hopeless, etc).  Went on 150 XL and had slight improvement, after 6 weeks went up to 300 XL and more improvement, and began to be able to live a normal life and be myself again.  With the increase to 300 i noticed my ears ring (but i already had tinitis so mostly it's just a worse version of something i'm used to coping with), my mouth is often dry and now and then my lips get super chapped, and the most notable thing is that i have a slight tremor, particularly in my thumbs.  I cannot easily delicately pick up things, which makes picking at food awkward.  It's about 4 months since i first started taking Wellbutrin (i'm on the generic, btw-Medicaid woo!).  The past week the skin around my thumbs has felt kind of thick when i bend them and TODAY i am noticing a stiffness in my left thumb. None of the other side effects alarmed or excessively bothered me enough to go back to being suicidal, but this stiffness is weird, it's like i don't have full range of motion or my thumb just won't go where i want it to.  Texting tonight has been very awkward, and typing is also feeling kind of weird, so this is the first time i've felt uncomfortable about a side effect.  If it worsens I would start to consider changing it up, but that of course is an upsetting thing to have to deal with and invite that kind of chaos and darkness back into my life now that i'm finally getting on track after wasting months laying in bed.  Hope you guys are doing well.

I started on 150mg & about 3 years ago I was moved to 300mg on the Extended Release. I have taken it with prozac as well as lexapro, but I feel like those medicines make me a zombie. Wellbutrin on the other hand seems to make me procrastinate less. It ""turns the volume down"" on the depressing & suicidal thoughts, gives me energy to do things. It does decrease my appetite, which is good because most of us overeat anyway. I'd say over all this medicine has literally been a life saver."

24$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$1/16/2018 3:17:39 PM$Reviewer: maplesyrup76, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I had been on Wellbutrin 150 XL for 3 months as my dopamine all but completely shut off suddenly.I suddenly lost all motivation to do anything and could no longer enjoy any of the things that previously brought me joy.After reading online I believed it was having dopamine and not a serotonin-related issue so I asked my dr to try me on Wellbutrin 150xl's. It took a few weeks but turned the dopamine taps back on near full stream again. Side effects I noticed during this time were weightloss, vivid dreams, poor short-term memory, anxiety(never anxious before), sudden and vivid recollection of very old memories, intensified fight or flight response and longer to get back down to the baseline as well as oddly stronger smelling urine. I found greatly restricting caffeine mitigated some of the jitteriness. Even with some of these odd side effects, I found it to be completely worth it for me to find enjoyment in my life again. It is also much much easier to cycle off than SSRI's and can be used for cycles when needed. I found it took about 5 weeks for me to feel full effects.
25$Condition: Stop Smoking$1/5/2018 8:48:32 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$ive taken this medicine before and quit after taking it for 3 days. This time though it made me a bit shaky,moody from time to time. But i have noticed that everytime i have taken this medicine to quit smoking I honestly quit within 3 to 4 doses of this medicine. it makes the cig taste really nasty and makes me kind of sick to my stomach if i smoke. I dont really have cravings for a cig after the first few weeks. I did notice it does keep me awake at night more than normal. But nothing that is bothersome. so i would recommend this medicine over chantix anytime. Chantix was bad for me. i would sleep walk and literally cook in the middle of the night and not realize it. i would have such horrific nightmares and so much more. i refuse to take that again. so the  only other medicine i can take is this one. and for me it has worked. i set my quit date for jan 1,2018 and i smoked all the way until 11:30pm the night before. i have been quit ever since without too many issues. but its worth it.

27$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/30/2017 1:26:55 PM$Reviewer: EricH, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication works well. I started at a lower dose and the NPR finally upped it to 450 mg per day (300 in morning and 150 after 12 noon)After I got to 450 I was happy, smiling and ready to do things I had not thought about in quite some time. Then they increased my mood stabilizer (latuda). It did it's job too good and stopped the wellbutrin from increasing my happiness. So, the NPR reduced the Latuda again with the idea that we could increase if necessary but not as much. I am big, 300 pounds, and it is hard to get enough meds in my, large system to do the trick. By going to 450 it made the medicine available and has actually begun to work.Finally a Doc that thinks beyond the label or computer program.

Each increase in dosage was beneficial for about a week, but then I'd hit a plateau. 450 seemed to be the right dose for about 3 weeks, but I've been on this dose for 8 weeks now and feel like the cons are starting to outweigh the pros. I'm not as focused anymore, in fact I've began to have more apathy. My depression hasn't really been helped and I have emotional panic attacks now and then, especially if I drink alcohol-which I was told was the equivalent to completely skipping a dose..makes sense. I've lost 5 lbs, and I'm not binge eating when I feel low, but now I'm obsessed with the weight loss and feel like that's equally problematic. I am less impulsive, but now I seem more obsessive than normal. I've had multiple surgeries in the past 2 years and I was developing a narcotic addiction, within 2 days of taking this medication that craving went completely away, but my ruminating thoughts are increasing again and the impulse to take a pill for no reason but to feel numb is coming back. I take this along with Lamictal, I've been on Lamictal for 3 years, but it wasn't helping with my depression that I cycle with every 6 weeks. I'm ready to get off of this medication, especially since I notice an increase of negative behavior during my menstrual cycle and I'm a week away from another one.

Bupropion XL-Teva/generic, for over a year now. I have never taken the ""name brand"" as a generic was available when I began treatment. ""Teva"" has bought out ""Actavis"", another generic brand, and my last two refills of ""Actavis"" generic bupropion have not worked as well as the ""Teva"" generic and I now experience ""weird side effects"" with ""Actavis"" pills. Tried to look up ""Actavis"" pills on ""Pill identifier"" and one of the pills-the 300 mgs., cannot be found so I am going to discontinue with the generic version of this medication and ask for the name brand, as I have heard many mixed/negative reviews for the newer generic versions of this medication. I am told at the pharmacy and by doctors that generics must be bioequivalent to the ""real"" drug and may contain ""other fillers/byproducts"", however, as I have had a generic migraine medicine prescribed that did not work at all-when the ""name brand"" works like a miracle. So I will consult with doc. for ""name brand"" or go to another medication, tired of the merry-go-round of generics.    "

Seems like my liver will not process these types of meds safely. I've been on many in search of relief but nothing so far has helped. At least with this test done it may enlighten Drs in the future.

Worked great until the depression bear attacked me again two months ago. He bumped it up to 400 mg with little impact.

 Now he wants to go back down to 300 mg and supplement it with Cymbalta. I fear the sexual and gastro side effects of Cymbalta. Has anyone tried this combination? Does it work on depression? How real are the side effects I mentioned?"

51$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$9/26/2016 11:29:59 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$2$3$I chose Wellbutrin over others due to weight gain concerns.  Initial 150mg dosage saw good results after 6 weeks.  Weeks 4-6 were a rollercoaster of emotions but I gutted through it per many similar experiences by people.  Dose was increased to 300mg but effectiveness is almost non-existent.  Very lethargic, cannot seem to get out of my own way, little concentration and feel more anxious. After meeting with neuroscience clinic I am now officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the dr. advised that I not continue on Wellbutrin as they do not endorse the 450mg max dose.  I have cut my dose back to 150mg pending appt with primary care to discuss alternatives.

I think its anxiety because taking a xanax will alleviate that feeling but really i would rather stay on the immediate release and take it 3x a day rather than this huge 450 mg all at once. Not sure yet if it is working because had a major relapse of major depression. i am praying it works because it's getting old. those of you with recurring depression know the ""crash"" feeling, then the attempt to get back ""up"" and normalize yourself again is so wearing. I just want to feel normal again. "

The first two were golden...lots of energy, my thoughts were unclouded and I felt focused for the first time in a long time. I woke up rested, not lethargic all day.  My orgasms seemed wonderfully explosive, something I hadn't experienced in years.  Another thing I liked was I would wake up at 4:00 a.m., well before my alarm.  I was on-time everywhere.  It was amazing....so I thought.  Then on the 3rd week, I had the most awful mood swings I have ever felt in my life.  I was mean, extremely agitated, I wanted to hurt people, I was so angry.  I cried over commercials, anything with music...slow or fast.  Everything was making me cry and everything was making me mad.  My appetite seemed to increase.  I couldn't control my eating.  I immediately called my doctor the next business day and she switched me right away.  I hate that it didn't work for me because I loved the energy and sex drive.

The first day I took 150 mg Bupropion (Wellbutrin) I felt less anxious. The night of the second day, I woke up remembering dreams, which I had not done in months, but used to be my usual. According to my psychiatrist it is supposed to increase REM, but many people haven't reported a difference. I happen to experience it. As the first week went on I felt more and more like myself, but with a still slightly drugged feeling. I dropped down to 75mg and my life has been so much easier. I'm not constantly on the edge of feeling like I'm not going to be okay, my suicidal ideation is gone, I can smile and enjoy time with my friends without faking it! It is like I am me again after years of intense MDD and ups and downs (mostly downs) on so many other meds. 
Unfortunately, while all other side effects have ceased, I am continuing to experience a huge amount of hair loss (alopecia) which is a very rare side effect. There is no other drug like this (that works on dopamine and norepinephrine) and therefore no alternatives to try. For now, I'm feeling like I have my life back and I'm not willing to give that up, even if my hair is thinning. "

I did some research and I started taking the generic form of this drug while weening off of Effexor and had HORRIBLE side effects - dizziness, nausea, and a terrible itchy rash on the inside of my legs. I discontinued the generic version and have started taking Wellbutrin brand name 150 mg once a day. It's only been a couple weeks but I've noticed increased sweating (especially at night - I wake up drenched in sweat and have to change clothes) vivid scary dreams, and today some dizziness. Can anyone tell me if this will subside or if I'm just not meant to take any form of this drug??

I was nauseous and had headaches and wanted nothing to do with cigarettes, so this worked for me I am still smoke free. However the side effects were overwhelming. From Day 1 your mouth is ALWAYS dry.  Waking up in the morning actually hurts your mouth. On the 8th day I could not get out of bed. My joints and muscles were inflamed and ached so bad I couldn't move. I stopped taking wellbutrin immediately and went back to taking my Effexor. It had been 6 days since I quit smoking (I continued smoking for 2 days in the beginning) so I was much better with the withdrawals. If this medication had not affected my legs and arms, I would probably still be taking it. It worked great for smoking cessation and my libido increased.

I do really like wellbutrin, moreso than SSRIs or SNRIs because it doesn't have quite as bad interactions with illicit drugs (If you're gonna do it at least be kinda smart about it) but mostly because it didn't have as many side effects for me, all I noticed was increased sweating for the first month which has gone away, and my appetite is poor and I lost some weight after I started it, but thats about it.

This medication saved my life and helped me get graduate college. I started feeling better within a week without even trying on 150mg but increased the dose with my doctor to 300mg, which worked the best for me personally. For example, it allowed I was able to stop thinking negatively, could concentrate again, stopped crying all the time, and stabilized my mood at a functional baseline so I could get what I needed out of therapy. All my friends and family told me I was acting more like myself and had my zest for life back. I'm so grateful- before taking it, I did not have enough energy to walk a mile. I had lethargic depression and after taking this medication, I stopped sleeping 14hrs/day, was able to run 3miles like I used to, stopped binge eating, and lost 10lbs after about 5 months on the medication. Once I started getting better (I do not take this medication anymore as my depression resolved after a 9-month combination of Wellbutrin and psychotherapy), I started feeling restless and got agitated, which are side effects and decided with my doctor that I was stable and had enough support in place to stop taking Wellbutrin. I slowly decreased my dose over a month when I did not have a lot of stressful events in my life and consider myself a success story as I rarely have symptoms anymore of MDD. This medication was wonderful and I'm so thankful that it was available when I needed it during the darkest point of my life.

96$Condition: Depression$1/7/2015 4:14:52 PM$Reviewer: autonomous_anonymous, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I relied on these reviews when I first started meds, so wanted to share my experience. 
I have been on Wellbutrin XL 300mg for about 2.5 years with extremely positive results. This is the first antidepressant I have ever taken, and I have been much better on it. No more falling through emotional thin ice 20+ times a day, no more crying, and hardly any negative thinking. Started on 150xl for about 1.5-2 months then up to 300XL. 
In the first months experienced almost no side effects save for a few strange new headaches a couple days, but they quickly went away. Only side effect is constipation, which can mostly be mitigated with fiber and good eating. 

I take it in the morning and it has not affected my sleep, though I find I do sleep better and am more refreshed when I occasionally take valerian or even a melatonin/benadryl. 

Last year I felt while I was doing well, but still needed a little umpf to push ahead. Tried the 450mg xl and it was fine for a few days/ a week but proved to be too strong; I felt angry, emotional rollercoaster started again, and couldn’t' focus or concentrate. Back down to 300 and all is well. Cost for brand name is outrageous. From my research decided to stay away from generics, and found a reliable pharmacy to order from for a fraction of the local pharmacy cost.
Exercise is still a must for me to feel O.K.   Not more than 2 days without of I fall back into a slump. Gym used to make me go from a -6 to maybe a 1-3.  Now I go from feeling a 3 to a 9/10 after the gym. "

It has gotten better since but still not as good as when I was on celexa. My side effects are severe dry mouth and my ears ring all of the time, drives me crazy but are obviously not the worst side effects you can have.  I was placed on this because the weight gain I had while on celexa made me feel unhappy and unhealthy. I have been on300mg for about 2 months. Not overly pleased but it has gotten better with time and I figured I would give myself about one more month before i talk to the dr about another change.

110$Condition: Depression$9/25/2014 12:01:37 PM$Reviewer: DJKLondon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I am a 47 year old male diagnosed with ADHD combined with bouts of major depression. Over the years I have tried every tricyclic, SSRI, SNRI and atypical antidepressant on the market. While I was taking Ritalin or Dexedrine I never experienced the dpression but I decided that I wanted to go medication-free for my ADHD. I question the wisdom of that decision but anyhow my doctor suggested we try Wellbutrin and I agreed. I started by taking 150mg first thing in the morning and then 300mg every morning since then. It's been about 5 months now and I can't believe the change in how I feel! Wellbutrin lifted me out of the depression right away (ie within 2 days) and it helps with the ADHD symptoms as well. Not to the same extent as the stimulants but it's enough that I can focus now and get tasks completed. I am so thankful for whoever invented bupropion. One think I noticed is that it is closely related to amphetamine and diethylpropion, both used in the past as anti-depressants/anorectics. I believe it is this similarity that gives Wellbutrin the edge over the SSRI's (which are garbage in my opinion)currently in use and I would not hesitate to recommend Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR or XL to anyone who is suffering the debilitating symptoms of depression! Two thumbs up for Wellbutrin!

116$Condition: Depression$8/22/2014 9:22:43 AM$Reviewer: katred, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$"As an antidepressant, it worked wonders within the first week, as the dose was being titrated up.  I had energy and experienced needed weight loss and was very pleased, as I did not do well on SSRI or SNRIs.  Unfortunately, I was not aware that I had a low seizure threshold and by the second week, I had a 15 minute duration grand mal seizure and resulting head trauma.  Therefore, the medication had to be discontinued.  

For individuals NOT prone to seizures, I think this drug could be very useful, but I do think extreme caution should be taken when prescribing to anyone, even is there is no known history of seizure, and it is imperative that front office staff be educated on signs of impending seizure.  

I called the doctor's office to report very uncomfortable side effects that seemed to come on rather quickly (tremor, severe ringing in the ears started overnight during second week of therapy and increased dose) and was told by the receptionist that they couldn't see me that day and ""might be able to work me in the next day"", and to not stop the medication until I spoke to the doctor.  After I hung up the phone, I immediately had my seizure.  I don't know if the agitation of their lack of care brought it on, or if it would have happened at that moment anyway, but I learned to be more insistent with medical staff members after this experience.    

So, overall, a wonderful alternative to SSRI and SNRI meds, but not enough education is provided to the staff at many medical offices and a 'warning sign checklist' needs to be in the patient file whenever this medication is prescribed."

I never felt so good, had energy, got out of bed, exercised, it was unbelievable. However, I lost too much weight and my Dr took me off telling me I had to gain 10 lbs and maintain it for her to put me back on the drug. I gained the weight, was put back on Wellbutrin XL my final dosage was 300.  However, it didn't work at all. I got no relief, nothing that I had experienced the first time I was on the drug. I have been on many anti depressants, and the first time on Wellbutrin was the best. I wonder if anyone else has experienced the same issue.  We tried it again last year, same thing, It eas like taking sugar pills.  I was on the brand as my Dr had had poor results with the generic.  I would give anything to have this drug work again and wonder if there are other reported issues with other patients.  So now my rating is no stars as it doesn't work at all, no matter how we changed the dosage.

Prior to it, I was using SSRI type antidepressants. I would recommend anyone with mild depression, which what I have, to try this  first. All the SSRI types caused me to gain weight, feel drowsy during the day, low energy and killed my libido.  Or it did mine. Ladies, if your husband has lost interest in sex while on SSRI's, it is not you. It is the drug. And I would still have bouts with depression. The Wellbutrin XL has none of the above side effects. It's almost the reverse and worked just as good for me as all the newest SSRI meds. Getting off SSRI's can be tough. They have some known withdrawal symptoms. A quick search of those can be found online. I felt like electrical charges were going through my brain and saw flashes of lights. Once that was over and I got on the Wellbutrin, I felt so energized. My libido came back and was higher than before the SSRI's!! I lost 30 pounds too. I tell everyone to try Wellbutrin first. I don't know why doctors don't recommend this medication. My psychiatrist never mentioned Wellbutrin to me. Started me right off with the SSRI's. I did my own research to find them, as I knew I had to get off the others.

I have been on Celexa/citalopram as it seems to work best for me overall. Chronic fatigue is one of my worst symptoms, so as we have many times, my doc and I are supplementing the Celexa with Wellbutrin/bupropion in hopes that the norepi bump would increase my energy. In the past the only difference I noticed was an increase in anxiety, and a practical inability to have an orgasm (anorgasmia.) This time the only difference I notice is anorgasmia. I wanted to post this because I know that Wellbutrin is considered (and shown) to be one of the anti-depressants with the fewest sexual side effects. Experientially, Wellbutrin seems to be essentially worthless as an antidepressant, and exacerbates anxiety. I am thankful I do not smoke, but Wellbutrin is also marketed as Zyban and prescribed for smoking cessation. I do not know what the numbers show for its effectiveness in stopping smoking, but in my humble opinion as anything other than perhaps smoking cessation the med is worthless.

Went to ""top doctors"", acupuncture, chiropractic, etc. the main point is I was told the AMA knows antidepressants have been found to work on specific migraine challenges. For 2 years I tried to get rid of the pain without medication until one day my migraine/stroke symptoms resulted in me thinking I was saying one thing and other words were coming out of my mouth! This terrified me! So I went to a top psychiatrist to see what antidepressant I should take. I had to accept the fact that I could not naturally get rid of my pain! This was in 1995. 

After much discussion it was decided that Wellbutrin would be the best medication with the least long term and short term side effects. I took the sample home and decided to work from home for a few days so I could take the medication safely. 

I will never forget this experience, it saved my life! Sitting at my dining room table, 45 minutes after taking the pill, doing paperwork when all of a sudden I felt a tingling sensation in the shape and size of a baseball at the exact location of my neck injury! I knew then that this medication would work. ( please understand that I was told not to expect any improvement for about 2 weeks!) we had to up the med once within in 2 months and that was it! Thru the years I have gone to the next generations, using the latest now. I cannot use the generic, it does not work the same and there are side effects! Most doctors know this but still people are forced to buy the generic due to cost factors. This is one medication no generic should be approved! 

Bottom line, I am fine. Thank Heavens! Hope this helps someone. "

Started taking it for these pains/shortness of breath and what the doc believed was a panic attack. I also felt jittery and my limbs felt weak.  I was always tired.  Now, I don't know what to think.  At first, I was dead tired but couldn't sleep on this stuff.  I was sleep deprived. I also seemed even sadder than before.  I'm still dead tired and have been sleeping but I feel shaky and my muscles are twitchy as well.  I don't know if this drug hasn't kicked in yet or it's time to try something else.  I also noticed, I went to work out the other day, was lifting weights, and that shakiness and muscle weakness really kicked in.  Anyone else have these issues on Wellbutrin?

What works for one person doesn't work for another. My husband thinks because I'm high strung to begin with and on the hyper side, I had bad side effects. I've stopped taking this 3 days ago and still not sleeping. Doctor put me on Ambien and I fall asleep but can't stay asleep more than a couple hours.

I have been taking Prozac for 2 years and it helps but didn't quite get me to feeling good most of the time (just less bad than I was). Adding Wellbutrin (you can take both) has made all the difference. And it has really helped me focus on work. Prior to Wellbutrin I would start to work and then get quickly bored or distracted and do something else. I had a hard time just getting something started. Wellbutrin has made a very big change in this area. I still get distracted a little but not as much. I may ask to try 300mg when I go see my Dr. But I'm much better off than I was. I didn't even know that I had ADD symptoms, but now I think that's probably what I have had. I am so much happier. Only side effect I notice is that I seem to sleep harder. But that's not a bad thing.

I am able to get up each morning with a positive outlook. I began cleaning, exercising, reading, meeting up with friends and properly caring for my daughter again. I have had no ill side effects except that I am hungry all the time and need to watch what I eat (holy sugar cravings!).

It has really helped me be more positive, less anxious, and more focused at work. On rare occasion, when under unusual stress, I take 10 mg of Xanax (in addition to Welbutrin) to help combat my anxiety.  I took Prozac for two years prior to starting on Welbutrin, but it just made me feel emotionally numb and finally stopped working altogether. I have had no adverse side-effects from Welbutrin and have lost the extra weight I gained while on Prozac.  It has not increased my sex-drive (unlike some other reviewers); however, it hasn't diminished it either.  I would highly recommend this drug to anyone suffering from low-level depression; although, I know everyone reacts differently.  My 18-yr-old daughter, who has ADD (inattentive type), was recently diagnosed with depression as well.  She just started taking Wellbutrin this past week (75 mg/day initially, increasing to 150 mg/day next week).  Hopefully, it will help her as much as it has helped me. (She also takes Concerta and Focalin for her ADD).

188$Condition: Depression$1/20/2014 5:47:27 AM$Reviewer: Frank, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I had tried two other drugs in the past 10 years (SSRI).  I was almost ready to give up but then gave Wellbutrin a try.  The adjustment period was hardly noticeable.  I did have a few nights of restlessness and some night sweats in the first two weeks.  The only major side effect was a major increase in sex drive.  I already had a  high sex drive but this was ridiculous!  Just having thoughts of making love to my spouse brought me to the point of orgasm, while at work!  For a few days, I was going nuts with sexual desire.  Eventually, this side effect ended by the start of week three.  Now, after two months, I'm feeling much more calm and in control of my emotions.  Thoughts of suicide continued in the first few weeks.  Now, after a couple of months, those feelings are gone too.  I also no longer have any desire to smoke and other habitual desires are also gone.  My stuttering, and fast speech and anxiety are also more in control.  Overall, this is my miracle drug.  Can't say it will be the same for you, but for me, life is now grand and improving.

My doctor was good and just kept arguing with them.  I finally told the insurance I was going to switch since I could not get the meds I needed.  They approved the BRAND name for use the following month and I have had no issues.  Good luck to you!

191$Condition: Depression$1/16/2014 12:08:01 PM$Reviewer: Katherine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I initially started Wellbutrin at 300 mg/day (150 mg twice per day) in 2005 along with Celexa at 20 mg due to depression and anxiety. I eventually stopped taking Wellbutrin when my Celexa dose was increased to 60 mg which appeared to be the right dose/medication for me. I was recently reduced to 40 mg of Celexa due to new studies that no more than 40 mg should be taken due to risk of heart issues/death. I am now back on Wellbutrin at 300 mg/day due to the decreased dosage of Celexa. Wellbutrin has worked for me. Side effects included decreased appetite, a little weight loss initially and dry mouth. I am a smoker and I thought Wellbutrin might help with that too, however, I did not notice any decrease in cigarette cravings while on Wellbutrin. The only thing I STRONGLY caution is do not EVER take more than your prescribed amount of Wellbutrin. I overdosed by accident (took 600 mg in one day) about 2 years after I started taking it, it was the worst experience of my life. Hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia....I literally thought I was dead and everyone around me was a ghost. I ended up going to the ER because of it (I actually thought my dead body was at the hospital and I wanted to go there to wake myself up). NEVER, EVER overdose on this medication. You will be sorry! But again, taken as prescribed, I am pleased with it.

The first couple of weeks, I was a bit more irritable, but was ok with it, because I cared about things again and was engaging again in life.  I was mostly irritated at how I had let everything go because I just didn't care or have the energy to do anything.  In the last couple of weeks, I have developed neck pain, headaches, and intermittently blurry vision, which all are listed possible side effects.  It's working so well for my depression at this point that I'm willing to wait a couple of months to see if the side effects go away.  I'm not sure if I've lost weight, but I'm cooking more often and eating less.  With all the other meds I've tried, it was the other way around.  All medications have side effects, these, for me are tolerable to be able to enjoy my young children and actually enjoy life again.  Before Wellbutrin, I was just kind of dragging myself through life.  I've had depression pretty much my entire adult life and tried it with and without antidepressants.  So far, With Wellbutrin XL, I feel like myself again for the first time in a very long time.

It was excellent. I became pregnant and had to get off of it, and I've been forgetful and more 'down' than when I was on it, but less nervous.

I was so hopeful as I've had a horrible time with weight gain on antidepressants, going from 120lbs to 180! Sadly, the first day I was on this pill I had hand tremors and dizziness. The second day I had minor chest pain and my anxiety skyrocketed. It's now the third day and I had horrible cold sweats earlier, and still intermittent chest pain, so I'm stopping. This is obviously not a pill that's good for anxiety, regardless of what my doctor says. I now feel like I've rewound my progress and have to start again thanks to this drug.

It did take a while for it to kick in.  I would say close to a month.  It has lifted me out of my depression AND has helped me tremendously with my concentration.  I suddenly can remember things that I used to forget.  I have actually started online courses because of it.  This side effect was really a welcomed one and I think helped me with my depression.  I was hoping that it would help with smoking and losing a bit of weigh.  But, feeling better with a sharper mind is just fine for me!

I was taking this medication a long with others to help with my Bipolar. Everything was going great, but I didn't know I was very sensitive to medications. I started having petite mal seizures, many times a day and all through the night. I'm even on Topmax which is an antidepressant/anti seizure medication, and I was still having seizures. My doctor took me off the wellbutrin and my seizures have stopped,  but my mood is going down hill. It's a great medication other than the side affects.

Co-workers suggest Wellbutrin and had weight loss effects and were very satisfied.  Thought I would try it.  I weaned off Celexa and started Wellbutrin 150 for two weeks but no satisfaction.  Increased to 300 by PCP and thought all was well.  One night about 9 I noticed I started itching at my ankle.  In an hour I had itchiness on legs and by 10 hives and welts on inner thights, backside, back of legs.  Lay awake until 3 am itching then noted hives and welts on abdomen, chest, underarms, under breasts and sides.  Became worried for spreading to my face or even tongue.  I drove to ER at hospital and treated with Benedryl and Prednisone immediately. 4 days later and I lost movement in my right thumb and hand very painful.  Went to ortho who have me injection and told me it was results from inflammationof the drug.  Today my hands are swollen and hurt badly and I am told it takes time to go thru system.  I am so dreadfully sorry that I switched medications and then again thank God for allowing me to live.  Never thought I would ever have a reaction and I guess time will heal.  I would rather be happy and healthy and perhaps a few pounds over weight than go thru what I have in the past week.

The reaction is often misdiagnosed as a virus, as was in my daughter's case.  After two clinic visits and two trips to the ER, she finally was diagnosed correctly, but had to be hospitalized for a week.   She gained 30 lbs. of fluid in just a few days and was covered with a beet-red rash.  Her major organs were also affected.  She had to be treated with steroids, which is another side-effect story.  Be your own advocate-  if you develop a rash while taking any prescription drug, take it seriously!   Your life depends on it.  DRESS Syndrome is a living nightmare and too many doctors do not have the expertise to recognize it.

However, he did not ween me off of the Celexa.  The Wellbutrin took at least three weeks before I saw a mood improvement.  I definitely was super low during that period.

I aim to take it at least 12 hours before I want to go to sleep.  I am on week four and still experiencing side effects, but I definitely have an improved mood so far.

Either they are not talking to their doctors or they need to get a different one who knows what they are doing. My NP who manages medications for a living starting me on this. I told her this morning, via email, I have had two nights with terrible sleep, waking up several times and feeling very awake!

I have not experienced any severe side effects.  I have dry mouth occasionally, some nausea shortly after taking the pill and don't sleep that well but I haven't in years.  With Wellbutrin I am back to being myself.  I'm not constantly worrying about anything and everything. I'm not dragging myself through every day. Suddenly grocery shopping or pumping gas is no big deal again. I'm able to think more clearly at work. I'm actually planning a vacation which, one month ago and for the past few years, would have seemed like climbing Mount Everest.  I'm just back to being me.  No better, no worse.  I haven't noticed weight loss but my intense love affair with food has waned.  I still like to eat, but its no longer my drug of choice ;).  Very pleased with Wellbutrin. I hope it lasts!

I took it for 4 days and then I became violently ill. Stomach bug or drug reaction are hard to say. It did increase my anxiety attacks so it is pointless to continue it. I am going thru menapause and the mood swings are getting in the way of running my life. feel like im having a heartattack made me realize that I have to quit smoking. This was supposed to help me. but getting so sick that I can't work or function is scarey. the first few days I had the bubble guts and trouble sleeping. but felt like I had medicine head. not good when you have to drive. 
I don't drink and drive, so why would I take meds and drive. dui or dwi, still against the law.

I stopped taking the other antidepressants and continued, but then couldn't afford the brand and started the generic. Awful; dry mouth, anger, sleeplessness, mood swings, and stomach aches; I feared long term effects and so I quit taking Celexa and bupropion over two weeks. It was truly horrible; crawly skin, agitation, depression, anger, disorientation and nausea. I lived in a bathtub for two days to calm my skin symptoms and calm my nerves. Six years later I still experience these same symptoms, although not as pronounced. I don't feel my brain/body is the same and I'm staying away from drugs now. Healthy diet, exercise and cognitive therapy as opposed to ""take the pill"". Being open with my friends and confessing feelings often helps. I still wake regularly agitated and upset/angry over something that is nothing later on when I'm rested and awake--so agitated I could be awake all night. I wouldn't do it again; I'd take care of health by going to a spa and getting verbal/understanding/relational therapy. Finding a decent counsellor is difficult, but persist. A mentor, a priest, a mature relative--these people can give a 'reality picture' or feedback so you can get grounded over time. It's not just understanding yourself; it's finding a real relationship that can go deeper than becoming a good social character. Someone to confide your soul with...don't stop looking but use your discrimination and don't just confide in anyone. Really know and watch the actions of this person for character and their own self-understanding. If you are really looking sincerely, someone will appear and not necessarily cost you $100. an hour. For me, it was a woman in my church. Good luck to you...

As soon as I started the increased dose, all the side effects came on. I went from being depressed sometimes to being constantly down. Sometimes I was unable to get out of bed and do the basic everyday things. I started having hallucinations, feeling disoriented and having blackouts. I used to be very active and worked out 5 days a week. I gained 20 lbs while I was on it. The more I excercise and watched my diet, the more weight I gained. My doctor insisted that I may have had a previous underlying condition not related to the drugs. She also said she would consult a neurologist on my behalf. While I waited for her feedback, I did some research online and saw that my symptoms may be seizures (which I never had before taking the drugs). She told me that the neurologist suggested I stopped the meds as it appears I was having seizures. Within 2 weeks after I stopped taking them, the symptoms stopped. Ironic that I may have ended up taking anti-seizure meds to fix the side effects of another drug that was supposed to help me. My doctor still insists that this is the best out there at this time. Would love to try the name brand but my insurance only covers generic at the co-pay price. If I want the original, I will have to pay almost $1000 per month which I cannot afford. "

I went back to 150 mg. but the only improvement was that I was able to sleep.  I'm conscious nearly 100% of the time that this medication is in my system.  I'm stopping it.  Better luck to you.

I started taking buproprion when zoloft didn't seem to be working for me.  I have been suffering depression since my husband cheated on me.  Unlike zoloft and lexapro, I didn't gain a bunch of weight nor did I feel tired and disconnected all the time.  I actually feel like my old self, the jovial old self.  I feel as close to normal as any other anti-dep I have taken.  The side effects for me were dry mouth the first month and increased...yes increased libido.  For some reason this drug heightens my libido not in the sense that i want it more but a great sense of touch and excitability.  (Wonderful not complaining lol)  The best thing I like about this drug is that I don't feel like a zombie.  I feel in control of me still.

On the second or third day, I noticed a few red dots around my mouth with a white head. After my shower I gently scrapped of the white head (it was very small). By the 6th day I was still very sick to my stomach, had a severe headache and the tiny whiteheads (rash?) had turned huge and they covered my entire mouth area, upper lip and my nose, my cheeks and also my back and breasts. When I took a shower I used mild soap and gently washed these areas, no matter how gentle I was they would all start to bleed and it would not stop. I had to hold a tissue on my entire face for up to 15 minutes with pressure. The rest of the skin on my face was ""dead"" that is the only way I can explain it. I could rub my fingers across my forehead or my upper cheeks and the entire first layer would rub off into large clumps of skin. I stopped taking Wellbutrin after a week and a half. the nausea is gone, the headaches are less frequent and not as intense however my face has over 30 red pimples, scabs, an area of a rash including my back and breasts. I will never put another Wellbutrin in my body again. "

I experienced some traumatic life events recently and planned suicide. Sought help and wound up hospitalized. I was put on Resperidone which i later found was an anti-psychotic med. I was extremely depressed but clearly not pyschotic. Post hospital psych doctor prescribed Wellbutrin 150mg 2x daily with Lamictal which is an anti-seizure med. Initially felt more cheerful and hopeful. After not sleeping more than 3-4 hours per night for 9 consecutive nights I missed two days of work from pure exhaustion yet still can't sleep. Also feel like someone is squeezing my heart and I am having night sweats. I will not take this drug ever again. Stopped today. Can't wait to get this out of my body.

Was on 300mgs XR each time & I managed to stay on it for at least a month (often 2-3) every time, but this stuff just turns me into a lazy sloth no matter what!.  Some people seem to be under the impression that its a stimulant but no way (I am actually on add meds so I know the difference): just wait until you've been on it for a full month, then you'll see! You'll see that it's like any other antidepressant in that it turns you into an apathetic zombie only you'll be way less choosy and you'll eat anything in sight.  I also found that this stuff DID NOT help my ADD in ANY way, but then again I actually have add for reals and am not just self-diagnosing myself.  I believe this could help calm hyperactivity though, so maybe it's good ADHD.

I'm wide awake after 4 hours of sleep but it only lasts for a couple of weeks and then I sleep fine.  They both make me a little scatter brained but especially the 300mg.  It's hard to concentrate.  But as far as the depression goes its great.  The GENERIC did not work AT ALL!  I've had many rounds with my insurance getting them to pay for the name brand but the generic simply did nothing for me.  My doctor had to call them and write on the prescription ""Name brand medically necessary"".  Increase thirst is the only side affect.  It's easy to wean yourself off of these.

First thing I noticed on the second day of taking it was that I was unusually short of breath, and my heart started being quickly randomly throughout the day. On the fifth day I woke up with a sore left arm, and the pain spread to the left side of my chest. Developed chest pressure and that continued on for the full 8 days that I took the medication and ended when I went off the medicine. My anxiety also seemed to have increased; I could never calm down and my body always felt heavy. However, the only somewhat positive thing I can mention is that I felt that this medicine kind of woke me up a bit; before I was pretty numb, but I started feeling again. The side effects were enough to make me go off of it within 8 days. I hope to try the name brand Wellbutrin to see if there is an improvement.

But feel I can be focused when I need to be. I take when go to bed and I don't have insomnia, nor do I wake up real groggy (which was a problem when I initially tried taking it in the morning). Agree that you MUST stay with name brand, or try ""Watson"" generic. ""Teva"" is horrendous though. Ruined one of my vacations when the pharmacy switched me from Watson to Teva and I didn't realize there would be a difference but it was an awful experience. I do prefer name brand though.

I have been on it for 12 years. I originally took 150mg once a day; moved up to twice a day but switched to 300mg slow release so I wouldn't forget to take one of the doses. I tried so many different drugs over the past 20 years that I've lost count and the side affects were often horrific. Once my psychologist recommended Wellbutrin and my psychiatrist concurred I have never switched and it is the only anti-depressant I take. I also dropped 20 lbs of the 30 the other drugs had caused me to gain. It has helped with ADD, SAD and the all encompassing symptoms of depression. There have been a few times during the years when I was unable to take it for several days in a row and you could tell but just one dose and I was back up feeling great. I'm sorry it doesn't work for everyone; it has so few uncomfortable side affects when compared to some of the newer drugs. But for those who have found relief I can tell you that after all these years I still have found relief. (My husband calls them my happy pills!)

Foggy head, slow thought process, disinterest in sexual relations, minimal positive effects. I am quitting smoking and may be Bipolar so we tried Wellbutrin XL, 150mg. Severely decreases my interest in cigarettes/nicotine. Does not affect my thought processes [after the first week or two], my intimate life, or my sleep [provided i take it in the morning]. I do seem to drop things more often, but that declines as time goes on. I feel normal. It's the perfect medication for me. I recommend discussing it with your doctor to anyone with more than one issue potentially going on, that focuses more on depression than anxiety attacks.

Best thing I ever did! I researched it on-line and found the ratio of people praising it to hating it was much more favourable than most other anti-depressants. Problem: I'm in the UK and it is only licensed for giving up smoking. So I have to order it from Europe or USA. I started by taking just a quarter of one 150mg tab and working up to the full dose by day 7. (different for everyone of course)

Doing it this way made it much easier on the side-effects which for me were itchy rash on my hand and foot and difficulty getting to sleep maybe a bit of nausea but I found if I  ate some food with them it helped -even though my research said it shouldn't affect. I have read that taking a quarter of a tablet and building up gradually to lessen side-effects doesn't work. It really does for me. Bupropion has made me feel completely ""normal"" I didn't feel like I was on medication at all, until recently. After about a year and half I found I got occasional head pains. Not a headache as such. If I lay down on my front suddenly to watch television or something like that i would get a sharp pressure-like pain. I would keep still or slowly sit up and it would pass. after a few months I gradually started to get a slight hang-over feeling for a few hours most days. without any changes to my diet etc. I don't normally get headaches. My delivery was very delayed recently and I literally ran out. I was very worried what would happen with suddenly stopping (i could not get any from the doctor of course) Nothing happened so I stayed off them for two months. I can now very slightly feel anxiety on waking up that I used to get but only slightly so I decided to start again rather than wait until it gets bad. Today is the first day and I have a bit of that slight tightness in the head feeling. Anyone else had similar?"

It caused my thoughts and behavior to be out of control.  I took it because my former MD said, ""if you have chronic pain you also have depression"". I have never been depressed in my life yet placed on Prozac and changed to Wellbutrin. This medication made me end up in a mental health ward where doctors automatically place a person on anti-psych drugs. Anti-psych medications are scary and should never be given to patients automatically.  Wellbutrin made my thoughts and actions so crazy and doctors since have told me that this is a common side affect.  Scary thought! Due to the fact I was discharged on these crazy drugs to take at home I continued to have scary thoughts and odd behavior.  This has been a nightmare that I would not wish on my worse enemy. Ive been in and out of psych wards for four years due to drugs that are on the market and we are told we must take the medicine a doctor orders. The ER doctor sees my medical records of a former  mental illness and then send me back to be committed to a mental ward with several E.R.visits. It was a revolving door as I would be once again on medicine that alters ones thoughts and behavior. I am lucky as my doctor got me off of Wellbutrin and every time I have been forced into a mental health ward by an emergency room doctor, my doctor weans me off of these terrible drugs and I am back to my old self.  I never had a history of mental illness until I started taking Wellbutrin and then being forced to take anti-psych medications will make your brain think things you wouldn't believe and behave in an out-of-control manner.

I originally started on Wellbutrin XL after participating in a double blind drug study for depression.  Wellbutrin combined with Cymbalta was the study administrator's best guess as to what I had been taking. This is not a usual drug combination, but it has done wonders for me.

I am just now seeing a difference. As each individual is different so do I believe how long or how soon it takes for antidepressant to kick in. I did experience some "" sudden anger"" moments but those too are starting to go away. I had been on Prozac for many years and it was not working anymore so doc prescribed wellbutrin. I think the transision between the two drugs is what caused some of my uneasy feelings but is better now. My advice is, give the drug time to get in your system before dismissing it. As stated everyone is different and it may just take longer for some to feel the effectiveness . It's helped me so far and anticipate it getting better everyday."

I have been on multiple drugs for my depression over the last several years and in and out of the hospital several times also.  I was put on the Welbutrin after my last hospitalization for attempting to take my own life earlier this year(2011).  I am currently on the maximum dose and I also take Lamictal(100mg)and Remeron(30 mg) to help with sleep.  I was like a zombie with the 5 meds I was on before my suicide attempt now I feel so much better.  For the first time in 6 yrs I have my energy back, I'm not falling asleep during the day,I am hopeful instead of hopeless and I am back working after an extended medicalleave.  I do see a therapist in addition to the medication currently and attribute the success of my recovery to the combination of the new medicine, therapy and the intensive care I received in my week and a half stay at a psychiatric hospital 6 months ago but I believe the medication change to Welbutrin has made a huge difference.  I hope my experience is helpful to someone out there who is suffering from this medical illness that can be difficult to treat.

Nor does it keep me awake at night staring at the ceiling the other antidepressants have done in the past. I take it along with seroquel 75mg at bedtime and I'm able to fall asleep without any problems. The biggest complaint I have regarding seroquel is tha it makes me crave sweets and other foods, so you really have to excercise discipline as far a healthy diet is concerned (but its not easy) because seroquel raises glucose levels and can cause diabetes, so you really have to try and limit you carbohydrates as well. Other than that, I'm satified for now.

I give Wellbutrin an OK.  I really need something more effective for depression.  I may take the leap to a new drug called Viibryd which is hyped as offering good depression relief without the sex problems.  I first got on Wellbutrin to knock out the Cymbalta sex effects.  It didn't work.  I may find myself on it to aid the Viibryd if it turns out to be problematic.  Anyway, good luck with Wellbutrin.  If it works for you..that's great.

I was miserable, nervous, angry, sad, never satisfied. Did nothing for the low sex drive. Demanded to be taken off after a month. 6 months later I am still hearing tidbits of what I was like when I was on Wellbutrin, in fact I can say I was almost fired by my employer because of certain things I spewed out of my mouth without regard to anyone's feelings. I am now taking Cipralex 20mg once in the morning. I have been taking antidepressants for most of 15 years.

First time I took this about 5 years ago I was literally having sexual urges constantly so my doctor took me off it after a month of ""bliss but agony"". Well, speaking to my psychiatrist who specializes in meds and heads the state board where I live, Wellbutrin was actually considered being used as a drug for lacking sexual desire when they did their initial studies. This was due to the results of the initial tests showing increased sexual desire of women and actual orgasm without stimulation. It was being studied at this time to see positive effects for depression. It helped me the first time I took it although I felt like a nympho. Back on it again 3 years ago to help libido but doing nothing but causing constipation...no sexual desire at all. Actually wish I was experiencing my initial use ""urges"" that caused me to stop it, was having ""almost orgasms"" at work and couldn't concentrate."

It made my husband happy, but being that I couldn't get enough I went outside the marriage to be satisfied. It almost seemed to put me in a bipolar state. It never happened before and it never happened since. Keep in mind I am not blaming this all on the drug because I was feeling like i wasn't getting enough attention at home and these other men provided that for me. It just seems an odd coincidence that this all started 4 weeks after i was put on wellbutrin. No problems since i got off the medication.

At first it was just anxiety, but as the years have gone by I developed severe depression on top of it. I've tried just about every kind of ""depression"" medication on the planet, and Wellbutrin (the generic, Buproprion) has been the one that's helped me the most. The depression has gotten 90% better during the time I've been taking it. Still have anxiety issues (but I've got Xanax for that...LOL)...but I'd rather be anxious than depressed any day.
I have to take this medication in the morning, otherwise it's hard to get to sleep at night. And I'm carrying around several extra pounds, but I think that all depression meds make you gain weight. 

After reading some of these reviews, it's obvious that everyone reacts differently to this medication as far as ""side effects"" are concerned. For the first week after I started taking it, side effects were a little rough...my hands shook really bad at times, I had a hard time sleeping, and I was a little nauseated. After my body adjusted to it (and it takes about a week) the symptoms subsided & everything was fine.

On the plus side ~ after I'd been taking Wellbutrin for about 6 months, I quit smoking. One of the nice little side effects of this medication. ; )

If you have depression and haven't tried Wellbutrin yet, give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.

I've just completed step 3 of the patches & my Wellbrutrin XL was increased from 150Mg to 300.I have COPD quiting smoking is a real challenge. I will say the Wellbutrin XL has helped with the deppression of quiting smoking.

Was prescribed this for anxiety after being on Lexapro for 2 years & feeling like I was in a coma, doc changed me to wellbutrin 150mg, it did increase my energy 100% but I suffered every side effect except weight loss of course (damn) & seizures, I had a constant headache & neck ache 24-7, tried tylenol & advil neither provided any relief, dizziness 24-7, rapid heart rate, nausea, shakiness, restless leg syndrome at night, inability to fall asleep, diarreah, hair falling out, constant ringing in the ears, all this started right away & continued 24-7 for 4 weeks, then I started hearing voices in my head that weren't mine!!  That was the final straw, I threw it out, think i'd rather just deal with the occasional panic attacks!!  It's fascinating how some people have no side effects & some of us have side effects that are worse than the condition it was prescribed for.  Zoloft was wonderful with no side effects but it stopped working after a year.

For those of you who have benefited from it, I am truly happy. Unfortunately, I did not. I have never experienced a med with so many and so intense side effects. The first couple of weeks were actually OK, but once it built up in my system I experienced severe headaches, dizziness, ear ringing, nausea, night sweats, insomnia, and nightmares. The drug also caused my system to violently reject ANY other central nervous system drug I put in my body. Couldn't have a drink, a cup of coffee, or even take an ibuprofen without feeling just awful. So I stopped. That was 2 years ago. Not the end of the story, however. Every 2 months or so I get what I call ""flashbacks"" where I have episodes of the exact same symptoms that last about 3 days. This stuff tried to take my body over and it still doesn't want to let go. I curse the day I took it."

After a divorce, losing both parents (within 7 months) and the recent loss of both my dogs, Wellbutrin just doesn't seem to be effective anymore. My doc tried adding different medications along with it, but weird side effects (from the newer additions) have kept me on Wellbutrin.

Overall, no real side effects with Wellbutrin XL except for losing a few pounds, but nothing major. Just wish it would have kept on working. Maybe my issues are just too much for it."

Pros: has decreased cravings, allowed me to stop and think before i do impulsive self-destructive behaviors (SBDs), reduced All-or-Nothing (AON)thinking with bingeing, reduces bingeing (best thing ever)also reduced depressive episodes gets rid of hopelessness feeling. OH AND INCREASES SEX DRIVE FROM BASICALLY ZERO TO A LOT.
Cons: nausea, shaky hands, dry mouth for a week. Makes me manic a lot more- get angry and very hyper during the episodes. i stopped taking it for this reason for 3 days and became very dpressed. hopelessness, called suicide hotline (never been like this before) altho my life ssucks rite now so that was part of it. went back on it and the mania has lessened. this drug also decreased my alcohol tolerance from low to basically zero- ystrday i got drunk off of half a bottle of beer, felt dizzier than usual. im pretty sure im not supposed to be drinking with all the meds im on (increased seizure risk) but im in college so thats not going to happen, you should probably talk to your doc about this.
overall i like this drug i have been trying to get it for years bcuz of the weightloss potential. im taking 2 other psychotropic meds so that may affect results. "

I could not get a good breath in- it was tight and no matter how hard I tried, it would take 5 or 6 deep breaths/yawns before I got one breath, then the process would start over. I had chest pain/tightness and an incredibly fast heartbeat. I exercise regularly and am only 24, so this was unusual. I ended up in the ER because my chest hurt so bad I worried I was damaging my heart. They couldn't find anything and wouldn't believe my generic accusation, until a social worker called a psychiatrist who confirmed my symptoms as a common side effect from this generic. I took Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression 8 years ago, and I was fine. I know my body has changed, but I believe this generic may be dangerous for some. With coupons, my co-pay will be $230... so now I will be either fighting or beginning again the struggle to find an adequate medication."

My doctor thought perhaps it would help with my obsessive/compulsive behavior.  It did not do anything for that.  I guess it helped with depression somewhat.  The problem arose when I noticed any time I'd lie down, whatever thought was in my head would vaporize.  Trying to remember exactly what I'd been thinking would not get it back to save my soul.  Sometimes, I would write down my thoughts, then lie down just to see if they'd go poof (they would)---at least I could read about what was on my mind just minutes before.  However, even reading the subject would not return the thoughts themselves.  When I brought this up to my doctor, he said, ""Uh-oh.""  Apparently, I was suffering seizures on Wellbutrin, which caused my mind to reset to 0.  I was immediately taken off this drug and another was tried--and another--whichever had the best sales pitch.  I ultimately did find an extended-release antidepressant that works perfectly for my particular needs.  "

Both issues have become worse as I head into menopause (very common so I'm told). I started with the generic version. After experiencing strange side effects (happy one minute, suicidal thoughts the next...and I'm NOT exaggerating), I switched to the name brand. Let me also state that I have never felt suicidal in my entire life! How scary that a generic med could make me feel that way. It is NOT the same as the name brand and I pay a hefty co-pay every month to have the ""name brand"" prescription filled. In any case, it is helping me with the mild depression/ADHD. And as a side note, I have develop tinnitus from the medication (not really noticeable until I'm ready to fall asleep). "

According to one article, it's the patented membrane that allows for extended release that seems to be the problem. Apparently some generics don't use the same XR method, which can lead to a huge release of the active ingredient followed by little to no release. Wellbutrin has a membrane-like wall that allows a constant release, but many generics use pills that just dissolve slowly. Other bodily functions can speed up or slow down the release (i.e., amount of food in stomach). Just thought this was interesting so I'm passing it along and will also ask my doctor about it.  http://www.prevention.com/health/health/healthy-l iving/find-out-how-to-use-generic-drugs-safely/ar ticle/ca929d93636d6110VgnVCM10000013281eac____

I've always been lucky in life and have had a great family and basically everything a child could ask for. Although, I've had some tramatic experences in my childhood my parents where in the process of getting a divorce, my father committed sucide when i was nine, and i had to move 3 years later due to expensive living in New York. After i moved  to the south it was a major culture shock and sunk into a depression. I was always a bigger taller girl which affected my self esteem, when i was 13 i weighted around 135 lbs and was 5'4. Over two years i gained 60 lbs and 3 cup sizes and am now 5'7, thankfully i still had a shaply hourglass proportion. Finally when i was around 195 lbs. i was severly depressed and though ""how did this happen"" and ""why did i let myself go"" Everyone said you look fine your a beautiful girl. Thankfully not to toot my own horne, but i am an attractive girl and look very mature for my age but that didn't matter i felt horrible. In 09 my doctor prescribed me Prozac 20 mg and i didn't like the though of being on medicine so i didn't take it reguarly  which is bad. It made my tired and it just did not work. My doctor was a prozac pusher lol. To make a long story short in October 2010 i wanted another advise and saw another doctor and he put me on WELLBUTRIN XL 150 Mg later uped me to 300mg. I though wow thats so much medicine compared to 20mg but he explained to me how it works differently and it has different mg and 150 isn't so much. 4 Months later now Feb 2011 i feel great and have lost 45 lbs in 3 months. The medicine isn't  a miracle drug or a weight loss drug. It just helps you feel like yourself, actually i felt like i wasn't on meds. It helps motivate you to help yourself and get back on track and boosts energy. It severly decressed my hunger which was a super plus and motivated me to start working out. 4 months later with watching what i eat (even over the winter holidays) an"

That's all changed now. I am very happy with the effects. I started at 150 mg for about 2 weeks and didn't feel much... then started on 300 mg once a day and voila, I felt a strong difference in my mood, no more nagging negative thoughts, increased ability to not only handle the stress, but become a strong leader in my family and help others develop a more positive attitude and perspective. I recommend this drug, but like everyone else says, hopefully not as a permanent way to deal with life. Once some of the challenges I am going through have been resolved, I plan to slowly taper off of this drug altogether. It is the ONLY drug that I take.

Side effects experienced are - dry mouth, dry lips, trouble sleeping (I can stay awake like I'm a teen again)some constipation at first, and I had one dizzy spell that lasted about 3 secs. I possibly had a headache or two. I suffer from migraines also. I do eat less since I am focused, I'm not constantly reaching for food. I am in school and can actually read a chapter and remember what I read. I still over react some but have only been on the drug 4 weeks. I don't dwell on things like that anymore. Once they happen, it quickly goes away. I love this drug so far. My pharmacy tried to make me take the generic. I gave it back and asked for the Brand.

I tried to ween off a couple mo.s ago and my mood was fine but I was experiencing very low blood pressure, disorientatation,and dizzy spells that lasted for hours. I cannot say that this was directly related to withdrawal. My Dr. could not find any reason for these symptons. I went back on my meds after that, because of personal problems as well, and they seem to work better now, I think I was getting used to the dosage... overall it seems to work well, I do still get irritable which could be beause I don't take my 1st dose right away when I wake up, and I forget or have to skip my second dose because it is too late in the day to take it..

All I wanted to do before taking this was sleep, and when I was up I was grouchy and irritated. I actually like getting up in the morning and enjoy my day. Everyone around me is much happier as well. I tried Cymbalta first and it didn't fit my specific needs, and in fact worsened my depression. There are different medicines for different types of depression. Wellbutrin works on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is for motivation and acivating the reward center in the brain. I wouldn't discourage or encourage the use of this drug. It's your doctors job, depending on your depression symptoms, to match you with the best medicine for you. You need not listen to people that say not to try it, everyone is different. This medicine may or may not work for you. Treating depression is not an exact science, due to our lack of knowledge about the brain. Finding the right depression medicine will take trial and error, which can be very frustrating. Stick with it and you will find a medicine that works for you.

General Dysthymia & Sleeping Problems

Pros:
The increased energy levels and motivation have really helped.  The initial euphoric/hyper feelings dissipate quickly but are still enjoyable for the first few days.  Bad thoughts and anxiety tend to pass much more quickly.  Bad moods and sadness are not nearly as ""low"" as they were before.  It makes it much more easy to combat problems instead of dwelling on them.  Improved sleep seems to be a result of the other effects.

Cons:
Constipation is sometimes a problem, but this can be dealt with through proper diet.
I also get more thirsty throughout the day.

Neutral:
Really reduces hunger pangs and overall appetite.  This has been very helpful for losing the weight put on while depressed.  It may not be good for those who are already lean."

One stay was 28 days. I'm a heavy smoker and was given patches in the hosp. The pharmacy was later delivering medication, ie... my patches to the hospital floor one evening. I have never felt such hatred, meanness, urge to actually kill. Not taking wellbutrin but going to start next week. My point is this: I was not just irritable, I was furious, until they got my patch on and all that went away. Maybe what you are calling side effects from the meds are actually withdrawl from the nicotine. I was astounded that I could feel such rage. But as I said, after patch got in to my system all the went away. I see there are two different kinds of wellb. one is ss and one is xl. Could someone tell me the difference. Also I was treated with many drugs, one being cumadin, the blood thinner, for a blood clot that in my leg that had went to my lung six times. I began to notice that when the generic was used, actuallly with all the drugs I had to take, I noticced that the generic drugs were a joke. My doc told me that drug co. have a 10% leway on what they put in meds. That is awful. Generics DO NOT work for me. and i can't afford the name brand. Has anyone else noticed this? and is there any way we can make a complaint to some organization.I did not mean to mislead about being on the medication, but I will be on it this time next week.

Hanging out with a ""bad"" crowd and some drug abuse. He's been in behavioral therapy for 2 years - I finally said, ok, nothing I am doing is working (therapy, life coach skills, summer school).  I was looking into wilderness camp for him too. But, I did not want to put my son on drugs for poor grades.  I did not want him on amphetamine drugs - adamantly. He has been on Wellbutrin 150mg 1x/day for a month.  The change was almost immediate. He wanted to cut his hair shorter - which gave him a real boost when the kids (girls) noticed.  He has gone from a F/D/C student to an A student (it's only the 3rd week of school - so we'll see).  Teachers he has (again) have noticed the change and love it.  He is my son again.   He still has the dumb friends, he still  is smoking uknowwhat I am sure - but it does not seem to be his all emcompassing thought.  He wants to go to the Jr Dance, he is exercising and taking pride in his appearance, he is talking to other kids too at school and noticing the difference in kids.   I am thankful I tried this medicine.  Even though the change is seems drastic - it feels ""normal"" to him, not like he is BAM someone new - just an improved version of him.  My only thought is that after only being on this for one month his Doctor wanted to increase him from 150 to 300mg - I don't understand that - why kick it up (soo much after only a month) when it's fine?  So, I said we'll try the 200mg - which is not timed release - lasts 8 hrs and if my son does not like it - we will go back to 150mg time release.  I guess the 300mg is timed release - but why drink Mountain Dew when a glass of water is really all you need? "

It works great. The pharmacist has several manufacturers he can go to for the one that works better for the patient so I would try different generics until I found a suitable one. I also take 225 mg. of Effexor XR along with the Wellbutrin and Buspirone (generic Buspar). I recently switched my Effexor to generic and it is working great. I guess because I have been on them so long, I do not have any adverse effects.My doctor is switching my Buspar to Xanax because the Buspar has affected my vision and I am experiencing involuntary muscle contractions and jerking movements. I tried Cymbalta once before and I felt suicidal so back to the Wellbutrin for me.

I was prescribed first Zoloft, then to fight the fatigue caused by it, Wellbutrin XL. As soon as I started taking WB I began to feel more energized, awake at 5.30 am, just like another reviewer, more alive. This was during the winter months. At this time I was also taking a small amount of Zoloft, that was upped a little while later to 200 mg's, at which point I began to feel worse. Than my wellbutrin was upped to 300 mg's,and I began to feel better again. I then ran our of Zoloft completely, and my medication provider failed to reorder it for me, so I remained without it for nearly five weeks. They were wonderful weeks. While the first few days I felt dizzy, I did not feel more emotional or irrational in any way. my doctor, however, insisted I go back on it when it arrived. Sadly. Getting back on that was a rough road. Only two years later, when I was diagnosed with lupus, could I stop. Wellbutrin has been amazing. Yes, it comes with some photosensitive side effects, not so fun for lupus patients, but the good outweighs the bad. Long term, i agree, the effects seem to fade a little. I don't like being without it. It helps another friend with Irritable bowel syndrome, it helped me lose a few pounds. Neither the generic, nor the 150 mg format is a good substitute for the extended release (XL). It has been great and I highly recommend it if you must be on antidepressants.

The insomnia abated after about 3 weeks of treatment and I take a fiber supplement to deal with the constipation. It also abates with time but never completely goes away. Another side effect at firt was a general ""hyper"" feeling but that also wore off after a few weeks. Unlike the SSRIs, Wellbutrin does not make me feel ""drugged” - I feel emotions, good and bad - but the difference I notice while taking the drug is that I tend not to brood or obsess over negative events or ideas, it is easier to let them pass. I think it has also made me more able to open up to talking about my situation because I don’t think I have to reign in my “bad” emotions so tightly as I don’t fear them getting out of control. It is easier to work through them, and talk about them. Wellbutrin by itself is a great help, but by far the most effective treatment for me has been talk therapy. Depression runs in the family. I did not start seeking treatment until age 27 when it became overwhelming  and was affecting my work and relationships. The first course of treatment my physician prescribed were SSRIs (Paxil, Prozac and Zoloft), but I could not tolerate the side effects nausea and drowsiness, but the worst, that although my depression was dampened, so were all my emotions. These side effects never abated. I became even more distant from people I loved and could not function effectively at work because it was difficult to concentrate. I had great doubts about all of the anti-depressants after those experiences, and am skeptical of drug claims and the pharmaceutical industry in general but have to admit that Wellbutrin has been very effective. I know that SSRIs are very effective for many  people - I just wanted to share that portion of my experience because I believed that because they did not work for me, nothing would. I am glad to be proven wrong."

I really like the fact that I don't feel like I need to sleep all the time which I did when I was on Celexa. I also like the way it helps boost my mood and has definitely helped with my sex drive that had been non-existent with Celexa. However, I am waiting for some of the side effects to wear off. My doctor said to give it a few more weeks before I decide if I like it or not. From day two I have been dizzy. It is better now than it was, but still feeling it. I also have been very nauseas and I have had a mild headache, kinda feels like a sinus headache. I also have had hot flashes and night sweats and my ADHD is actually worse. I find that odd since this drug can also be taken for ADHD. 
If the side effects fade I am all for this medicine, but if they don't there is no way I can keep taking it. I have also had some trouble sleeping, but as long as I take at least half of my dose of Neuratin and Buspar a few hours before bed I am fine. If I forget to take it early I can't take it at all because I need 12 hours before getting up to get those two out of my system or I can't find it hard to wake up on time. I'm gonna give it one more week and if the side effects don't fade it is back to the doc for our next trial and error run."

752$Condition: Stop Smoking$5/26/2010 8:46:58 PM$Reviewer: JustSayNO, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$3$I use to take Wellbutrin many years ago for depression. This was before they came out with the SR and XL. You had to take it using a starter kit that had a certain dosage for each day. Side effects were minimal for me except for severe upset stomach for the initial 2 to 3 weeks. It eventually subsided. My doctor said that side effect is rare. Well NOT 4 me. My doctor wrote me a prescription for XL 300 the other day to help me stop smoking. Im assuming the extended release formula replaces the need for the gradual starter kit. I sure hope so otherwise taking 300mg from the get go may be intolerable for my digestive system. It worked pretty well for my depression but what I remember most was the effect it had on reducing my smoking. Cigs tasted like sucking on molded burnt logs. I quit the medication because at that time I really wanted to enjoy my cigarettes again. Idiot I know. Not this time though. Those old molded burnt logs are going to be thrown out never to return. I suggest this medicine for smoking cessation over that new Cymbalta stuff. It has the same indications at about a tenth of the price. Cimbalta is just ripping people off. I really doubt it affects the brain much differently than does Wellbutrin. Especially when only taken for a short period. Wellbutrin is indicated for smoking cessation. If it was harmful to people who are not depressed I doubt that this purpose would be listed as one of the uses. If I could afford the Cimbalta I'd try it instead just to see how it compares for me versus Wellbutrin in altering the taste of cigarettes. My guess is Cymbalta does not work as well as Wellbutrin for this purpose. It was marketed differently probably due to the stigma some have for taking anti-depressants. It will interesting to see what the effects,if any,while taking when not depressed. It may have the effects of ecstacy...lol doubtful but it would make for quite an experience.

I was diagnosed with Major Depression 5 years ago and initially was prescribed Celexa. I felt a little better but still had no concentration or energy. My psychiatrist added Wellbutrin XL and it turned out to be the answer I needed. I would not have survived my depression without the addition of Wellbutrin to my celexa (300mg Wellbutrin and 40 mg Celexa). I know some people have shared negative side effects of this drug but you will not know unless you try it. It worked well for me but it is not for everyone. If you have depression please do not give up on finding the right medication for you. It just takes some time. I have been on meds and in individual therapy and it has been successful  in treating my depression. I am now to the point where I am titrating my Wellbutrin so that I can be med free and start a family. Thank you Wellbutrin for giving me my life back!

this is probably the single WORST drug to ever be invented. i urge you before trying this drug to examine every other possible option with your doctor. everyone i have ever met who has taken this has had severe problems with it."

I see the doc tomorrow and wil try something else. I do want to day I had the insomnia for about a week, the a rash for about 3 days, but th eside effects have pretty much disappeared, so if that is a concern for you, try to tough it out.

But after starting a family, work and daily activities, I found myself overwhelmed and it was difficult to deal with people and situations. It was enough for me to consult with a doctor and see what was out there to help. My symptoms in plain english included, not wanting to be around friends or functions that normally I would attend, loss of interest at work, easily distracted by anything, sleepless nights, picking at my husband over every little thing (which was causing problems.

I took this drug when I was 20 turning 21, I quit taking the drug b/c I had bad side-effects (I figured out the only time I had those side-effects was when I was drinking alcohol) recently I realized I had a serious alcohol-abuse problem, I joined the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have been sober for 5 months. When working with my Psychiatrist in an attempt to control my ADHD (he wanted to work in my Alcohol Abuse) I asked him if I could try Wellbutrin again.  I have only been taking it this go around, for less than a week, I take Wellbutrin in addition to Trazadone (for sleep) Lexapro (my opinion the BEST anti-depressant) Adderall (for ADHD), one of the 'benefits' I am receiving from Wellbutrin is the cessation my my nicotine cravings! The other 'benefits' I am experiencing: more 'real' energy (not too much) I am able to get through the day without PRAYING I can go to bed when I get home at 6pm, also I can THINK much more clearly, I have patience now (I didn't realize I wasn't very patient before), I have a reasonable appetite during the day (Adderall suppresses appetite) I am calm and I cry a lot less than before :)

I slowly switched from Effexor to Wellbutrin, I take 400mg in the morning now, then added Xanax .25 at night for anxiety. The effect was startling - in a few days, I hate much more energy and motivation. I used to have to take naps at work at lunchtime because I felt like I was going to almost faint - at least 2-3 times a week. I have done that for 10 minutes once in 2 years. I was able to do 5 years of taxes that I was too tired to tackle before, and I can function much better in general now. Made a huge difference in my life, night and day. Wellbutrin affects dopamine levels much more than most of the SSRI's, I believe that's the reason. I am a recovering alcoholic (26 years sober), and drinking affects dopamine too, so I can see why Wellbutrin works for me.

It would seem to me that this medication could very well increase anxiety for those who have anxiety related issues. 
What it has done for me : Got me out of bed instead of sleeping all day for no real reason i could think of . It jump-started me so to speak. I have way more get up and go along with reduced anger,i got away from this senseless sadness,constant rehashing issues i have no control over and this is what i should be.

The side effects are annoying (get less sleep now, increased libido, possible increase in anxiety) and really became noticeable at 300mg. It hasn't hosed me over like just about every other anti-depressant I have taken (and I've tried a couple dozen at this point) so it's the one I have to settle for. I'm taking the SR version in case my IBS acts up. To the person that asked about taking all of the SR's at once, they release the medicine over a 12 hour period, so I have to wonder about that. I spread mine out (loosely every eight hours). On the other hand, having a higher dose during the day may be a good thing. Sounds like you should ask your doctor about this.

808$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/1/2010 8:55:28 PM$Reviewer: Christine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$The Brand Wellbutrin XL 300 mg works very well for me, with Lamictal 200 mg and ongoing psychotherapy. It stabilizes my mood swings effectively. However, my insurance company decided to switch me to generic form of Wellbutrin. I assumed it was working for me until I hit bottom and was so out of control I didn't know what to do. I wasn't in therapy at the time. My GP was continuing the prescriptions and follow up with me after I moved away from my therapist. My GP recognized that I was in trouble during a routine exam and sent me immediately to a therapist she highly recommended. This therapist works closely with a psychiatrist that I am now seeing.  She recognized that the problem was the generic form of Wellbutrin (I wasn't taking Lamictal at that time).  I read several reviews by patients experiencing the same problem, with the same symptoms, which I found on the internet. I owe my life to these doctors for recognizing the problem and switching me back to Brand Wellbutrin XL.  My insurance company still won't cover the Brand but insists on the generic even though my doctors have explained the problem and insisted that I take the Brand name drug. I have to pay full price for Wellbutrin or suffer the dire consequences.  I have now ordered the drug from a reputable pharmacy in Canada at a lower price.

My ""mild"" depression includes a general feeling of lethargy, difficulty motivating myself to do simple things, feeling overwhelmed with the thought of completing simple tasks.  I was functioning in life but at a  lower level.  Anyway onto the med review:  MD prescribed 100 mg 1x a day and then told to work up to 200 mg 1x a day after a week.  First week at 100 mg....tons of headaches, crazy dehydration, wierd flighty feeling, nauseus, lack of appetite.  I convinced myself to stick with it at uped my dose.  Experienced 4 days of the worst headaches of my life.  I had to quit completely b/c I couldn't function.  Waited a week and began 100 mg once a day again and this time no headaches,  I am sticking with my low dose since it seems to give me the extra lift I need.  I don't feel medicated or foggy.  The biggest thing to disappear was the feeling of being overwhelmed.  I feel like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.  As for side effects now...I have a tendency to get dehydrated more quickly when on the meds so I have to really drink alot of water.  If I don't hydrate the headaches follow.  Initially my appetite completely disappeared.  Now it's less but not significantly.  This med does seem to reduce cravings in general.  I am not a drinker but had a couple drinks (despite my better judgement) on NY's Eve.  The next day or 2 I felt like the meds weren't working.....felt lethargic, just down.  Definately not worth the drinks of Champagne so I'll abstain 100% for now.  I am at a much lower dosage then is prescribed for most people but it works for me.   Main con i that I do notice that I can become agitated quicker.  I am usually the most laid back person, almost too laid back.  So for me it's not a big deal but I wouldn't recommend this med to anyone who has a tendency to anger easily or experiences anxiety."

I took the 2 a day version for 5 months before not being able to stand the headaches anymore.  I also felt very jittery the first week or so.  I recently switched to the extended release medication and my headaches are gone!  My doctor said that maybe the large dose twice a day was like a fire that then burned out over & over.  I would definitely recommend the extended version of this drug.  In the past I had taken zoloft and I did feel great.  A little too great.  I gained 30 lbs over 6 months and had NO libido.  And I couldn't sleep at night to boot!  I did love how I felt, but I had to sleep and I didn't want to take a medication to sleep every night on top of the zoloft.  I like the welbutrin better for me because it only lessened my symptoms enough to be able to wrap my head around the issues in my life that were completely overwhelming me.  It didn't mask the problems as I felt the zoloft did.  Only helped me feel like I could compartmentalize them and start to deal with them.  Definitely make your doctor give you the extended release!

She began to withdraw from her normal behavior, and her school work regressed to about a 2-3rd grade level.  Her memory was affected dramatically.  We removed her from the Wellbutrin treatment after we heard similar stories about the effects.  She began a slow recovery and is functioning at a high level now.  Her ability to know left from right, tell time and several other skills that she had for several years were severely affected and she continues to struggle with some of these issues.

The symptoms were all there, however, we removed him from his Wellbutrin that had been prescribed for depression a year before, and he slowly began to improve.  It took several years before he could function again on a level that would seem normal.  He continues to have some memory problems, but the onset seemed keyed to his start of the Wellbutrin.

*and after finally getting off this med, migraines still occur.
I was hospitalized early on from a migraines created by using this drug. **I  had no history of migraines before this. needless to say the doctors do not know these symptoms and do not advise you. i had 5 straight weeks of migraines and discontined Welbutrin XL 150 and on the second day after, the migraines stopped! Also i do not feel suicidal all the time, as with effexor use and welbutrin; that was a 100%- 24/7 hobby with the use of these drugs; thinking of suicide and stopped my artistic life style cold. too bad i let them tell me to take this crap for so long. life's situations don't make us always need a pill... to fix us in the mental department. sad the doctors who give us this stuff- do not know what they are really doing.

Found myself in a state of lethargy but not physically tired - like I was on auto-pilot. Went to work, paid the bills, but in a state of zombie - like a mental lobotomy. Wellbutrin (with xanax that I was already prescribedd for anxiety) has shown positive results. I hate to think that drugs (or alcohol for that matter) are the answer, but clearly, Wellbutrin (buproprion) is an effective adjunct to my transition toward totally clean living.

The right doctor, the right attitude, and the right support system (outside the clinical realm) are important. I see Wellbutrin as an excellent mental stabilizer toward the end of dependence, and the transition toward livivng life on life's terms."

Treatments over the previous 20 years included Adapin and Prozac, both of which had unpleasant side affects; nonetheless, I stayed on Prozac for 15 years prior to switching to Welbutrin. My overall experience has been good, especially in the beginning. However, after insurance forced me to start using the generic, I have found it to be less effective than the original formula. I'm thinking about going back to brand name even though I have to pay for it. I hope it's the generic formula and not due to tolerance build up that is causing the waning effects.

I have been on the generic brand of Wellbutrin XL 150mg for 6 weeks now, and feel ""better"" overall (taking med for chronic depression/anxiety) and not having the severe mood swings, nor the usual emotional outburts and crying spells that I used to.  I feel more focused and in control...finally getting myself back and able to smile.  I have completely stopped smoking cold turkey, which was not initially intended, but a definite benefit. I have not had any side effects, except some weight loss due to appetite control, which is also a welcome benefit. I went up to 300mg after 4 weeks, but found it to make me very irritable, so I came back down to 150mg. After visiting my doctor, we decided to add 10mg of the generic Prozac to my med regimen, since I felt that I was very ""indifferent"" and not really finding the ""joy"" in things.  Today was the first day on Prozac...felt lots of energy and remain very optimistic.  Good luck everyone.  You're not alone:)"

They also caused weight gain and sexual disfunction. I was weaned off of them with a lot of withdrawl symptoms. About 8 years ago I was on wellbutrin. I remembered how much better it was than the others. When I felt that things were getting bad again I asked my Dr if he could try me back on that. I immediately had more energy, better attentin span, weight loss and better sex. I am only taking half the dose prescribed, 150mg in the morning. I am now at a plateau, so I may begin taking my second dose of 150 mg early afternoon. The only side effects are slight hand tremors, some irritability and my heart races especially if I have a few drinks. Not enough side effects to give it up. Really, if the other drugs you are taking make you feel lifeless, ask your Dr to try this. When I went off this the first time I had way less withdrawl sickness than the others.

I have BP and had an episode of severe depression that lasted several months last year. Before that, my episodes were manic except for a depressive episode when I was sixteen. The mania is not as severe or as lengthy as it was in my late teens and early/middle twenties so Lamictal alone has been enough to keep me stable at this point. After 10 weeks on Wellbutrin I finally started to crawl out of the dark pit. My current regimine is 300 Lamical at night and 300 Wellbutrin XL in the morning. The Wellbutrin causes ringing in the ears. I don't notice it too much until I sit down at the end of the day to relax (I have two small children). I enjoy reading, but am distracted too much by the ringing to concentrate. I am tolerating it because Wellbutrin has worked so well for my depression. Also, I had been on a generic and my Pharmacy switched to another generic brand and it really messed me up. I was very anxious (I don't suffer normally), confused, dizzy and had a strong metallic taste. My doc said that she's had other similar complaints and recommended switching to the name brand. I did and since then have been back to as close to normal as I'll ever get LOL:) Also, to all those suffering from sleep problems and irritability, do you drink caffeine? I'm very sensitive to it and have been off of it for six years. On occassion I will ""splurge"" and have a sweet tea or Dr. Pepper at a resturant, but then I'm very jittery, irritable, hyper and VERY chatty. When I finally go to bed (2-3 am) I wake up often which impacts my mood and concentration the next day...vicious cycle, so I stay away from it."

The Clp I like it seems to really help calm me. I take it around 1 pm before my kids come home from school! My primary care dr. retired so my new dr wasn't comfortable refilling the clonopin because it can be addictive! Who cares if I'm taking it everyday anyway? So I go see a real phsyc. dr. f9or help. The first 2 days I was very tense and jumpy had hot flashes. After that the migrain hit. I have suffered from headaches in the past so didn't relate it to the meds for a couple days. But after 4 days of severe pain in the top of my head, I spoke to my Dr. who said a small percent of people will experience migrain from the Wb. The next morning I had an ice pack on my neck at six am. I took only the Celexa that day and realized around 11am my headache was almost gone! I still had tension and restlessness dry mouth. Today I didn't take anything until about 11 am I took 1/2 clonopin to take the edge off. I am actually feeling good today. I slept better last night. That helped alot! I see him in one week, during that time I will try go solo as much as possible. (I have my clonopin if I get too out of hand!) Then I will ask my dr to try effexor xl. I was on this for 5 years before I got pregnant with my youngest. I did very well after the 1st couple weeks of side effects. Hope this helps someone. I know I go to the reviews to see how pills effect different people. It helps. We all have a different chemistry and a single goal in common...TO FEEL GOOD!

It is an extended release version of the drug which should help eliminate the need to take it more than once a day.  Anyway, my best advice to anyone with depression and/or bi-polar disorder is to try any meds that are offered or are available.  It took a while to find the medications that worked for me.  Don't be worried about taking more than one drug either, if you need to.  I have been taking Wellbutrin XL for 3 1/2 YEARS.  I am taking 450 mg and have been for most of that time period.  I have had excellent results on this med, and have had no side effects at all, ever, nor have I had any significant weight gain.  This medicine has worked wonderful for ME.  I have bi-polar disorder; therefore I also take Lamictal 400 mg, and Seroquel 100 mg.  This is the ""cocktail"" of meds that have worked for me.  Medicine affects everyone differently.  Don't think that just because one person had serious side effects that you will also.  This medicine may be just what you need.  Sometimes you have to trust the doctor more than the reviewers.  The doctors know what the side effects may be.  They are in no way trying to hurt you!  They are trying to help you the only way they know how!  Good luck and God bless you!  There is hope, just don't give up!"

Before taking Wellbutrin, I wasn't a depressed person, but it caused me to become suicidal and ended up overdosing and was hospitalized due to severe seizures.  I was diagnosed in my early 20s with clinical depression, and was put on Wellbutrin XL again to treat it.  It made a major difference in the first 2 months while on it, but after that it became useless and I became more suicidal than ever.  My appetite was very off while on this medication - I could go for two days without feeling hungry and would literally have to force myself to eat.  My anxiety worsened on the medication as well.  I just switched to Zoloft today. Hopefully that will help!

It has made a major positive difference in my life in the way I handle things; I am able to think much more clearly and rationally.  For the first few years I combined the medication with therapy.  I was taking 225 mg when I started and have had to increase it once to 300 mg/ day.  I currently take the Wellbutrin 300 XL.  Word of caution on the generic version of Wellbutrin 300 XL - I tried it when it was approved and found after a few months that I was becoming depressed again.  The generic did not work for me; the tablet may have the same amount of medication but the packing (what makes up the rest of the pill)is completely different than the brand name.  For me it seemed like instead of medication being steadily administered to my system throughout the day it hit all at once, thus the return of the depression.  I was hoping to be able to save some money with the generic but it is worth it to me to take the brand name.

I had to stop it because it made my depression worse. I felt hopeless and started having suicidal thoughts. I was tired all the time and I felt like all I wanted to do was sleep. It took so much energy to get up and do ANYTHING that it like I was fighting with my inner stubborn child to get anything done. Including going to the bathroom. My mind felt like I was in a fog bubble and I couldn't think. I had to concentrate very hard about just basic things. I became cranky, irritable and downright ridiculously rude. Anything that I thought fell right out of my mouth no matter what it was. I couldn't stand being around me... I know no one else did either. Having two children that I homeschool, I couldn't stay on the medicine. I decided that mild depression was better than being psychotic and on the verge of catatonic.

For the first time since I was a child I felt like a ""normal"" person. It helped with every facet of The Monster, Depression. I have been taking this drug for twenty years and I will never give it up. It and the doctor who prescribed it gave me my life back. It also helps somewhat with Fibromyalgia and CFIDS. It once   helped to keep me awake. I no longer get that benefit from the drug and am taking Provigil to try to remain alert.

I've been taking Wellbutrin XL for over 4 years. I also was taking Cymbalta (didn't notice any help from that drug), but stopped due to the perceived ineffectiveness over 6 months ago with no negative effects. WB however seemed to help level out my depression. Instead of the very deep lows they became less severe over time until my mood was manageable. When I began taking WB I immediately noticed a decrease in appetite and lost several pounds right away. In time my appetite came back and have gained the weight back. It also helped with my cravings for habits I had stopped years ago, e.g., smoking, drinking, drugs, etc. If I wanted to stop smoking, drinking or drugs I would HIGHLY recommend WB as an adjunct therapy. I see why ZYBAN is prescribed for smoking cessation! I have tried weening back to 150mg from the 300mg dose I take daily before bed, but noticed mood changes within a week so I went back to 300mg, not wanting to fix it if it wasn't broken. It seems as though I may have to take something for the rest of my life as I have been a lifetime depression sufferer. The only side effect I suffer from is that I think it contributes to sexual dysfunction, but depression itself could be the main culprit. There is no free lunch with any medication. Your mileage may vary ;-).

Not to mention feeling jumpy and jittery most of the time. I am convinced that the generic form is to blame. Will be going back to my doc very soon...something has GOT to change and SOON!!

968$Condition: Depression$8/9/2009 12:17:06 AM$Reviewer: Julie, 25-34 Female  (Patient) $3$3$5$I have been on the generic Wellbutrin for a few months now. I cannot take the XL or XR type. I do not have more energy, I am still very fatigued and I seem to be as depressed as I always was if not more. But I don't think the worsening depression is from the generic Wellbutrin but from other life issues. I am all for a medication that doesn't cause you to gain weight because if you are already depressed that will cause additional depression at least it would in me and I would be non compliant.
969$Condition: Other$8/7/2009 9:18:07 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug drastically improved my quality of life. Though I do not have a formal dx of MDD, I suffered from both depression and fatigue- not sure if it was fatigue as a symptom of depression, or that I was depressed because I was fatigued all the time post mono.  In any case, the Wellbutrin XL took care of both of them. In my experience having tried all three, the brand is the best, then the generic buproprion, and BY FAR THE WORST is the generic budeprion-HORRIBLE headaches.  Right now I have been taking 300mg of the generic buproprion for about a year because the brand got too expensive, even with insurance.  While on the brand drug, I lost about 10-15lbs but since have gained it back (not sure if it is related to swtiching from the brand to generic).  Side effects I experienced/still experience include a headache the first week on it, constipation the first week on it, and for the two years I have taken it I have had increased eye sensitivity to sunlight.  As a patient taking it and a registered nurse, I highly recommend this drug for patients experiencing depression with fatigue, especially if SSRI's increased your feeling of fatigue.

983$Condition: Depression$7/24/2009 3:46:23 AM$Reviewer: Kathy O, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have suffered from depression most of my life.  In my early 20’s I started see a psychiatrist.  I received talk therapy as well as antidepressants’ throughout my life.  I have been off & on Prozac for the past 20 years.  For nearly two years, I have had trouble with sleeping too much (anywhere from 12 to 20 hours a night).  When I saw my regular doctor, she suggested increasing my Prozac to 40mg & said I should expect to stay on it for the rest of my life (I am 63).  With no improvement she added Effexor (75mg).  It didn’t seem to improve the sleeping or depression.  Besides the excessive sleeping, I also felt like crying all the time; found no joy in life; had no energy; & no motivation to do anything (other than what was absolutely necessary ).  I went to a psychiatrist  and he decreased the Effexor  (37.5mg).  With still no improvement, he stopped the Effexor and started me on Wellbutrin (300mg).  Within about three weeks I felt like a “normal” person.  I would wake before the alarm would ring, had more energy and felt not so hopeless. I hadn’t felt like this in a long time.  The change lasted about two months.   After he wrote the next prescription for Budeprion XL (300mg), which he said was cheaper.  I started to feel like I was going back to my old pattern of sleeping too much (not as bad as before but still too much) and not as much energy as with Wellbutrin..  I am sad to say I did not experience any weight loss with either the Wellbutrin or the generic.  While taking the generic, I had some adverse effects which include: dry mouth; tremors of the hands; increase in resting heart rate (85+ per minute); trouble keeping my balance and some hair loss.  When I see the psychiatrist in a month, I plan on having write a prescription for Wellbutrin, not the generic.  It is worth the extra money.

It has really helped me out in so many ways.  I have Muscular Dystrophty (FSH type).  Have been markidly depressed for about 6 years.  Nothing has worked, until I actually asked.. to try Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin has changed my life.  It has definatly increased quality of life, over quanity of life.  Makes dealing with my everyday disease more at ease, with my physical weakness, and mental tiredness.  And what I like about it is, is that it doesn't make you feel ""high"" or ""euphoria"", well, to me anyways, but you just... feel good.  And that is quality of life to me."

989$Condition: Other$7/18/2009 5:26:06 PM$Reviewer: ashleyamore, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$3$I just began [this will be day 4] my treatment with wellbutrin. I tried to get an appointment with a psychiatrist only to be told that I couldn't be seen until the middle of august. [almost a full month from then]. I already had been suffering from severe daytime anxiety, but one night I awoke with what I would later find out was a nocturnal panic attack. This was very scary for me, as I thought it could've been sleep apnea, and my nighttime panic attacks were MUCH worse than my daytime ones, which is saying something. My heart would race, beat out my chest, I would shake, become disoriented and dizzy, and my chest would tighten up. My breathing would become very labored. This happened to me every night for over a week before I broke down and went to my PCP. He prescribed me wellbutrin 150 mg once a day for a week, to be increased to two a day if I don't see results. I also have bipolar disorder, which I'm not sure if my PCP knew.  Anyway, my side effects were NOT pleasant. For the first three days I was so restless I felt like I was going to claw my own skin off. I had TONS of energy. My nighttime panic attacks worsened. I felt like I was on coke. [LITERALLY]. I couldn't stop pacing, and my heart was racing. I couldn't sleep. I took my medication at 8pm as I'm generally a night owl, figuring this would be ample time for my body to adjust to the medication before sleep. I was up every day for 3 days until 6 am. Last night was the first day so far that I felt only mild symptoms. I was twitchy but able to sleep at my normal time [around 1 am]....It makes me somewhat apathetic. But once I would take the medicine during the first three or so days of treatment, let me tell you, it was HELL. I seriously considered stopping the medication because my anxiety was driving me crazy. I do have the jaw clenching still. If you can stick it out through the temporary hell, its not so bad for my mood. STAY CALM ON THIS MEDICINE- IT MAKES PANIC ATTACKS MUCH WORSE DURING THE FIRSTDAYS

Five days after starting, I woke up 5:30 am with such a severe headache I could hardly move, which was followed by severe nausea- my husband got a waste basket for me just in case because I could not move.  I had really bad chest pains added to this, and I counted the minutes till my doctors office opened at 8:00 am.  I had read that some people had more severe side effects with the generic version.  The active ingredient is the same amount in both, but the other components are different, causing some people to react differently.  I wanted to be prescribed Wellbutrin, not the generic, and within a day, most of the symptoms had gone.  What a relief.  It has been mostly a good change- I feel more calm, less anxious, and able to concentrate more, I feel almost ""normal"", but I still have some agitation and sometimes cry at small things, but do not feel depressed, if that makes any sense.  It usually only lasts a few minutes.  I think it would be beneficial to add another medication to this to maximize my results."

After taking it I feel normal again. I know it works becuase if I miss a few pills the same feelings come back until I start taking the pills regularly again. They seem to have a few day delay. Also, my pharmacy gave me the generic version one time so I thought what the heck and decided it wasn't a big deal, but I was wrong. It made my feel like I wasn't taking anything at all and the old feelings were back. After that I made sure my pharmacy always gave me the name brand. This drug really works for me.

No weight gain and lots more energy with normal wellbutrin. antidepressants and heart meds as well as thryoid meds have the biggest problem with patients not doing as well on the generics, Insurance companies should be more concerned about the health of the public rather than making a buck

in a few weeks He could tell .  I felt it within 48 hours. That was the first drug I was on so I never really trusted them after that and no drug ever came close to helping me but it stoped working.  and I was put on
I couldnt even tell you how many drugs and combos. since then.  BUT I did learn that 
it is true that when they (who ever they are)say it may take six weeks , trust it , don't give up. Its a good drug and I dont

There is a difference in absorption rates among the generics and I felt like I was getting it all at once-  Zoned out, headache, down right rotton and tired.  I read an article about some having the same problem so tomorrow I'm back to wellbutrin.  Also it's common to need another medication with this to combat what I call compulsive hyper nastiness.  Everyone is different to what brand/dosage/combination works for them and requires alot of patience.  If you don't feel your dr is listening to you when you're not feeling well, move on to another dr. Just like meds, some drs are better than others.  :)

Regardless, at the times I would go off of Wellbutrin, I would get into addictive habits like excess drinking and other unsavory vices.

Now, I don't think Wellbutrin is all that effective since I take other drugs that address the underlying issues I have with the bipolar and ADHD.

It does make me hyper and at times very aggresive but I know it is just the medicine and I can keep it in check.  I haven't gained any weight either.  The only negative thing I can say about it is if I take too much of this medicine, I feel very irratated. I have to space 2 150mg XL at least 4 hours apart. I can't take one 300 mg XL at one time.

I was prescribed 150mg, but after 5 days I had to get off.  I started to get increasingly shaky and I got a bad sore throat and dry mouth.  I didn't sleep for like 2 days, and I started to act kind of weird - like I blew everything out of proportion.  I also started to get nauseous and have headaches.  Anyway, the evening of the 5th day of being on Wellbutrin, I ended up having my first ever panic attack...the night before a final.  It was horrible - it was one of the worst nights of my life.  Thankfully I was able to get a hold of my psychiatrist who was able to get my final rescheduled - I know for a fact I would not have been in any shape to take it the next day.   

Anyway, I'm disappointed Wellbutrin didn't work for me.  I realize that it helps a lot of people, but if you start to get these types of anxiety/mood symptoms, go off before it gets any worse - because it will, and it's not fun.  "
1047$Condition: Other$5/14/2009 9:15:26 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I was put on Wellbutrin XL 150 for complaints of anxiousness associated with job related stress.  I was on Lexapro 5 mg which assisted me in not worrying about how I would manage to complete all the tasks of my demanding job each day.  However, the Lexapro gave me a zero sex drive.  At 30 years old, I was not comfortable with that. In the first week, I took 2.5 mg of Lexapro while starting Wellbutrin XL at the recommendation of my doctor.  The first week I did not have any problems, but by the second week, I began having racing feelings, hot flashes, chills, belly pain, and what seemed to be an increased heartbeat and off vision.  Additionally, I felt agitated and by week three, was crying off and on for no reason.  After four weeks of being on Wellbutrin XL (3 weeks of just Wellbutrin XL by itself since I was still taking Lexapro in the first week), I contacted my doctor, who as luck would have it, is on maternity leave now.  I attempted to taper every other day for a few days, but I felt worse on the day I took the drug versus the day I skipped.  I am now 12 days off Wellbutrin without tapering.  Nevertheless, I am still having hot flashes off and on and a racing heartbeat feeling.  It is not as bad as when I was taking the medication every day, but I still do not feel myself.  If you have just a bit of anxiety about how you can manage all that is required in a job which lots of responsibility and long hours, I would not recommend starting this drug.  I do not have depression,  yet most of what I am reading seems to indicate that people who need an extra push to get out of bed are the people that find this medicine useful.

I felt so much better on it but as of now, I am 40 lbs heavier. I have maintained the same weight for like past couple years prior to taking Zoloft and now I cannot stop gaining. It averages about 10 lbs a year and changes in diet and increases in exercise did nothing for me. I got frustrated and depressed about myself so I called my PCP and told him I wanted to try wellbutrin xl, because I heard its does the same thing and often causes people to lose weight rather than gain. I have been taking the generic Buproprion SR now for a little over a month and I am completely miserable. Apparently, people who have anxiety are not supposed to take this drug because it only treats depression and a side effect of it is an increase in anxiety. I have been experiencing loss of appetite but that come with nausea and queasiness-- I feel like I am pregnant (and I am not!). My head feels like its out of whack and I cant really describe the way that it messes with my vision and hearing without sounding like a whack job. My doctor should have known that this drug, with is an SNRI will not help me the way an SSRI does because of my anxiety. This past weekend I graduated college-- an important part of my life-- and I felt incredibly hostile and would go from screaming at my friends and family to bawling my eyes out in 2.5 secs. Thanks, doc. I am glad that I have google and WebMD to tell me what I should/should not take, because he apparently cannot.

The only good thing so far is that I am not smoking as much, only about 2 or 3 cigarettes a day from smoking about a pack a day. Guess I will be going back to the doctor very soon for something else.

My mood doesn't flip at the slightest negative event and one annoying thing no longer ruins an entire day for me. I can think clearly and positively without losing my ability to be upset when there is a reason to be. (nothing like showing up to a funeral grinning and cracking jokes because you can't feel sad.) I don't have issues with getting up in the morning (well not ones that I didn't have long before the bipolar set in. I am not a morning person.) and I don't have the issues of manic episodes where I can't sleep until I have to be medicated into unconsciousness. I no longer constantly sit at my desk with the lights off holding a box cutter and staring at it for hours or go off on screaming rants about things that are trivial. I feel in control of myself and my actions as opposed to the constant feeling of being out of control; an observer in my own self destruction. This is what it does for me. Considering that we are all complex creatures of finely balanced chemicals it may not for you but that doesn't mean there isn't something that can help you regain control of your life. Take time with your physician to figure out what is right for you. And be picky it's your life if something isn't working go back to your doctor and try something else don't torture yourself and end up even worse.

The wellbutrin itself worked great, I had loads of energy and did not experience any of the side effects. However, since I've switched to the buprpion,(due to insurance prefering everyone use Generic),I have tried 3 other antidepressants to try to help with the side effects. My mood has changed dramatically for the worse, no energy, headaches or migraines at least 3 times a week, have not even wanted to quit smoking, and now I am at the point of just staying alone, not want to join in family functions or talk to my closest friends. I highly recommend that anyone taking Bupropion XL talk to their physician about writing a letter of referal for the name brand Wellbutrin XL to the insurance company because the Generic is not the same and does not have the equality as the Wellbutrin.

In December I began taking the 300mg XL version.  It helped me tremendously.  I had so much energy and motivation to do things.  It was a generic.  In March I had to switch my pharmacy so they gave me a different generic.  It was made by Watson.  I started getting really tired all the time.  I was constantly angry with people for no good reason and also seemed to be obbsessive compulsive.  There were also many physical side effects also.  I finally realized it was the medicine and stopped it immediately.  I began feeling so much better within 24 hours.  I can't believe the difference in these generics.  Please pay close attention to how you begin feeling when you take these.  I seriously think I would have become suicidal if I had not quit and I have never felt that way before.  If it's not working for you go to your doctor and try something else because these medicines can really change your entire personality.

1065$Condition: Depression$4/21/2009 11:20:32 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$3$Wellbutrin alone didn't do anything for me, but together with Lexapro, I felt like a new and happy person. The only side effect that I didn't like was the low sex drive (since I am married, my husband wasn't happy about that!) But he admitted I seemed genuinely upbeat and energetic. I even decorated the house for Christmas which was incredible for me since my depression worsens around the holidays. Having tried many different meds, I think this combo works the best.

Maybe I'm just sensitive I guess.  With this one the worst was probably the constipation and blurred vision with bouts of dizzy spells where I felt off balance all of a sudden.  It seemed to work well with keeping my anxiety attacks under control and supressing some OCD tendencies but again I can't handle the side effects.  I am hoping something will work as well without the extras I don't need.  We'll see I guess...

However, I experienced a paradoxical reaction to the medicine about 48 hours after first use.  Interestingly, the first time I used it, I felt better.  Not the next... I felt like I wanted to die.  I have had depression most of my life, and this beat everything I have ever felt (this was a -1 dose- effect, btw).  I quit taking it immediately and tossed it in the trash.  I had an appointment with my psychiatrist the next day, and told him all about it.  Normally, a doctor would say not to miss a dose (which I did by not taking it the next morning) without asking, but mine said he was glad I got off it.  Desipramine works better for me.

Not suggesting that this is a poor drug; I'm sure it's great for many people.  However, believe it when they say it can have side effects or make you feel worse..."

This is not about Wellbutrin, but the generic, Budeprion SR 150 mg x2. Irritability, jitters, at first, with 2nd dose at noon--super-witch, anger replaying itself.  I checked reviews of generic first, before reading here.  Many of the same comments were made.  At first, it seemed to work w/Lexapro.  Then after weening from Lexapro I  felt so brain racing and fatigue from the event.  Thought it was the Lexapro withdrawal.  Paid attention to my reactions after a.m. dose only and then with noon dose.  There appears to be a cumulative negative effect, producing more irrational impatience.  I'm scared; will discuss w/psych after having read generic reviews and Wellbutrin reviews.  I  do not normally have bad reactions to any kinds of medication.  NB: the generic medication seemed to work w/ Lexapro for a year. I've been on the genric Budeprion SR for two months. I'll ask to switch to the Wellbutrin and write back.  I've been retired about a year--I should be relaxed.

In that time I went from being my easy going sweet self to a witch on wheels. It was bad enough for my whole family to sit me down. I was later diagonsed with bi-polar due to extremely stressful conditions. I'm not sure if this medication exaserbated that problem since at the time it had gone undiagnosed. I would recommend before starting anything for depression you make sure that's all you're dealing with.

1081$Condition: Depression$4/7/2009 11:02:49 AM$Reviewer: lazybonz,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on wellbutrin for 15 years-I came off of it for a short time but the anxiety caused me to return to it again. Like most depression sufferers I have tried many drugs over the years but this one has the least side effects and works great. I occasionally get dry mouth so you do need to stay hydrated.  I was a smoker and a drinker and have kicked both habits as the drug really does reduce cravings for any pleasure. Unfortunately that does include sex as well-it does decrease your libido but that can be overcome if you work at it! It does not decrease the pleasure level but the desire to get started just isn't there. I did have a period of time where I was not eating as it does also take away your cravings for food. My hubby loves to eat so he makes me eat too,so I have not had anorexia since I met him but I did with my first husband. So I would say that an understanding mate goes a long way toward helping to make this drug a success. I take 150 sr upon waking and before bed. My insurer is also pushing the generic but that did not work for me. I understand there are some generics that are better than others and if the cost is a factor you could try those first. I am convinced that wellbutin treats alcoholism because it runs in my family and I was a problem drinker until I took wellbutrin. I can have a drink now and not want another-but that may just be me. It is sure worth a try if you drink too much-I don't know why it is not more widely used for treating alcoholism because it works. You do have to take wellbutrin for 60 to 90 days to get the full effect of the drug.During that time you do have dry mouth but that subsides after a while and was not a significant problem for me. I am 62 years old so I don't know how much longer I will take it but the doctors seem to think that it is a lifelong drug. It has made a drastic change in my life and I recomend it highly!!

I have tried it all.  Paxil made me sleepy and sweat but relieved anxiety, Prozac gave me tons of energy but made me 'crazy' and moody, Cymbalata made my anxiety go thru the roof, Celexa didn't do anything. I was on Zoloft for years, it was great for the anxiety but not the depression.  I slept a lot and just had no ambition to do anything more than I had to. I am now on the generic of this - 150 the first week and I am in day 2 of 300mg.  I LOVE IT SO FAR!!  My energy is through the roof, my fog of depression has lifted and I feel great.  My only side affect so far is that I seem to have an aching back, that could be due to the anxiety level needing to balance out.  However, I will take a slightly aching back over no energy and sleeping all of the time!
One thing I have learned is that everyone reacts differently to each med. so you just have to find the one that works for you."

I can cope .  I tried stopping several times, became immediately in major depression.  I started with low dose,gradually over the years increased to 300mg.  I have tried every version and every generic and brand name, each one is a little different because of absorption rate is differs from brand to brand.  All are effective, but I do notice differences if affect and side-effects.  Some are absorbed more slowly so work best when take b4 bedtime to not interfere with sleep, but others donot.  Also different people will experience different absorption rates between brands and dosages.  So you all hang in their, talk to your Dr.

Loved the energy boost and eveniness of my mood. I also immediately quit smoking...have tried quitting many times before with no success. I started getting bad cramps and realized I was horribly constipated.  Tried upping my fiber and fluid intakes but nothing helped.  I had to stop taking it because of this...BUMMER.  I really liked this med and wish I could continue but I can't take laxative everyday to conteract the constipation!!!!!!!  Some decrease in sexual desire did occur.  My doc prescribed me Effexor XR and I filled the ordered but I do not think I will try this one because of the horrible things I have been reading about it.

I wasn't given the XL to start off with and for some reason...just couldn't remember to take 1 pill 3 times a day.  I am a SUPER busy mom and full time college student (aren't we all super busy though?).  Anywho, After 2 weeks I went to the doc to let him know about my difficulty and THEN he gave me the XL...it is SO much easier taking 1 pill in the morning and being done with it.  So far, things seem to be improving.  I am on the 300.  It has ALSO cut back my craving to smoke (AWESOME..since taxes went through the roof..again).  My depression seems to be getting a little better but I haven't experienced any weight loss that I was REALLY looking forward to.  LOL!  
I am giving the XL a month to ""kick in"" and hopefully by then my depression will have subsided or at least decreased more.  Oh...ALSO...I AM tired ALL THE TIME!  But if the medication helps me smile again and feel ""normal"" then perhaps less sleep and an occasional redbull will make it all worth while  :o)
Good luck to everyone who is taking this...I not only hope it works for me...but for all of you as well!!!

Can anyone tell me some POSITIVE REASONS why I should continue use??? & How hard is it to wean yourself off of it????? Jill, I read your comments.  Would love to chat:  [email protected]

I was given this medication for depression, weight loss, and to help me quit smoking.  I was originally diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and then after many tests, I was advised that I didn't have it (ARGH!). I have tried many other medications such as Adipex, Merida, Lexapro, Effexor...etc and have had no success (with MAJOR side effects), so this is kinda my last hope and I'm praying this will work.  I haven't experienced any side effects yet (maybe just a little more tired), but it hasn't been that long.  I just want to feel ""normal"" again and be able to function as a ""happy"" parent should.  Please keep me in your prayers as I will keep you all in mine.  Also, if anyone has any additional info they would like to share...I welcome it!  Thanks so much!

Wellbutrin was effective in those areas but once I was  told to increase from one table to one and a half the gates of hell were open. I began to fell trapped in my own body and wanted to get out by killing my self. I would cry uncontrollable and even wanted to kill my husband. It felt like I was walking in water. I was told by a pastor to stop taking this immediately. Once I stopped I have not had a day of depression. I used to get depressed often. My advise is do not take this med unless you really have to try to quit smoking and lose weight on your own. I pray that those of you who are taking this will not experience the negative effects that I had.

My doctor bumped me up the the XL. It started working almost immediately. It felt as if the veil and earmuffs had been removed and colors and sounds became real again. I was extremely happy with the 50 lbs I lost. Sex drive came back with a vengeance. No listed side effects. It is now Feb 2009 and it doesn't seem to be working anymore; back to being irritable, short tempered and just sad. Going to Dr in 2 days to see if something else will work. One side effect that I can't find anyone else having is it messed with my period, even on birth control. My period would come whenever it wanted regardless of what week of pills I was on. Once I switched to taking the BCP at night and Wellbutrin XL in the a.m. it seemed to get MUCH better. Now that the wellbutrin isn't working as great, my cycle is completely whacked. Usually one week w/o it, then get it for a few days, then another week w/o, etc. Doctors say it has nothing to do with each other but I have been on the same BCP for almost 6 years and it didn't happen until I started taking the Wellbutrin XL.

I combine Wellbutrin XL 150mg with Adderall XR 15mg during the week, and take just the Wellbutrin on weekends (when I don't work).  I have had few negative side effects-- the two noticeable are the dry mouth (the dryness affects intercourse as well) and hair loss, which I experienced when I was on the 300 mg dose.  I backed down to the 150mg and the hair loss has stopped.  I am grateful I was prescribed this drug first-- it really does work quite well.

I've been on Wellbutrin for (about) a year and MUST comment on the effects of the generic brand, Bupropion (Sp?). 
   Because I don't have insurance, I spent a while on the generic version and failed to progress out of my depressive state. For a few weeks I felt like I was mildly feeling a change, but eventually it felt like I had plateaued, and shortly after, I returned to spiraling downward. 
   There were other medications added and subtracted to Wellbutrin in order to determine the right combination of drugs to aid my depression/anxiety/ADD. I AM POSITIVE that my only improvement was the result of other medications (Lamictal- mood stabilizer). 
   It has been documented that the generic version of this drug does NOT produce the same progressive results as the name brand. I can confidently say, that my experience w/ Bupropion was not a good one, in fact, I'd say it was horrible, and at times, worse than my initial state.
   I have been back to taking the name brand Wellbutrin XL for about 3-4 months. I have continued to feel a drastic improvement in my mental state, and finally recognize the person that I knew I always was. It has enabled me to live my life again.   
   Although I have felt such a great improvement, the cost is $167 (that's with insurance), which is the CO-PAY! Without the insurance, the cost is $230-$270, and very few insurance companies offer reasonable coverage for Wellbutrin XL, since the generic version was approved."

It definetly helped me overcome my depression for a while. However the drug did give me seizures. I'd take 5 or 6 Wellbutrins a day (as opposed to one)to get high and lose wieght. This gave me grand mal seizures. I stopped the drug and resumed my pill regimen months later, vowing to take only one pill a day. I did, but still had seizures. The seizures weren't a result of overdosing on the wellbutrin. They happened because I was taking them while abusing street drugs (Ecstasy and Cocaine). Please, tell you doctor if you have a drug problem or are prone to overdosing on OTC/prescription pills for fun. I crashed my car into a tree during one of the seizures I had.

After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, I don't build up a tolerance (even after 10 years), and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

Did not help my anxiety but I still take Lorazepam for that. In the last 3 weeks (about a year since I started it) I've become very depressed, irritated at stupid things, angry. This morning my doctor said sometimes it just doesn't work anymore. She prescribed Cymbalta so I'm going to wean off of Wellbutrin while weaning onto Cymbalta over the next 6 weeks.  I do know people who got WORSE using Wellbutrin, I know some who love it after years of use. I was right in the middle. I loved it but it just stopped working.

Wellbutrin has been a life saver for me. It works very well for me combined with Effexor XR.  Took a long time to find a combination that worked. I have more control over my emotions, irritability,anger and suicidal thoughts. I feel so ""normal"" sometimes I forget my meds. Isn't long before (24-48 hours) before I notice a difference and get back in control. 
Unfortunately, my medical insurance changed this year and instead of a $35.00 co-pay, it is now $215.00 co-pay for the Wellbutrin. I am guessing it is to force folks to get the generic. I refuse, I know I will not do as well on the generic.I am scared,I do not want to go through the misery of finding a substitute. What if I can't find something that works as well for me?

All previous medications were either ineffective, or caused intolerable side effects. Wellbutrin, for me, is a miracle drug, allowing me to function like a normal person.

I quit smoking as well as lost nine pounds. I went from the verge of dropping out of school to finishing the semester with A's and B's. ALL GOOD!!!!! One side effect was an initial loss of sleep-which faded. I also have a high resting heart rate because of the epinephrine in this med. I think this could be harmful long-term.

Initially I was prescribed this 150mg twice daily by my PCP and noticed a remarkable difference in my ability to focus and concentrate, and it improved my mood.  Unfortunately the dosage was too high to start out with and I had very uncomfortable heart palpitations and was dropped back to 100mg twice daily.  That continued to help my mood and memory a great deal but I didn't have the benefit of the focus and concentration.  Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist and still taking 75mg daily of this plus some Ritalin, which is helping me to concentrate better and not get as distracted.

It also curbs my appetite. At first it made it difficult to get to sleep, but .50 mg of Trazadone is enough to help me get to sleep, and makes it easy to get 7-8 hours of sleep. Wellbutrin does not affect my dreams like Prozac did. With Wellbutrin I do not have the sexual side effects associated with other anti-depressants.

It took about 3 months for me to be completely satisfied.  It also curbed my appetite and I've been able to lose 25 lbs.  Nice.  It also helps with concentration.  I haven't felt this good in over a decade. Everyone is different, so if you're trying this and don't feel the results you want and it's been less than 3 months.  Give it a chance.  An added bonus:  No sexual numbness.

My doc said I should only take the Lunesta when I really feel I need it..hello!! I need it every night...the withdrawal effect is unbearable...2 to 3 days is the longest I've gone in not taking...also extreme inner ringing in my ears..sounds like I'm in a house full of crickets!!

None of them worked well.  Then, my doctor prescribed this. After about three weeks, I noticed that I would wake up without the customary depression that had been afflicting me for over a year and a half. Mind you, the depression has not gone away, but it has lessened greatly. The medication also sped up my metabolism and I lost weight. Nice. I also have more energy and my mind is not as lethargic as before. I take the medication with Lamictyl for anxiety and mood swings. Bupropion's side effects are occasional hyperactivity,  occasional stomachaches and frequent visits to the number for number 2, which may be caused by my sped up metabolism. Furthermore, my libido has increased and my performance in that department has improved. I am fortunate to be taking these medication and hope the benefits to not subside with time. Again, I emphasize that the depression has not ceased completely, but it has lessened in frequency and intensity.

When I would have a low, although less often, they would feel like life or death lows. And my tension increased. But it did change things, atleast, just not for much better. But different, but still bad, is better than same and still bad.

It was easy to use. Only thing is trying to take it regularly and trying not to get drunk while taking it.

I'm pretty neutral about satisfaction. I believe it may work for some, but it increased my volatility, although it did do *something*, atleast.

We tried many different dosages, but I had awful side affects-constipation, sweating, ringing in the ears, weird weight fluctuations, and almost constant headaches.Having to take it two or three times a day was really diffult to manage. I continued to feel sad, hopeless, and TIRED. I slept all the time. This medication did NOT work for me at all and I weaned myself from it according to my doctor's instructions. I am now on Paxil and still have constant fatigue and headaches. Although Paxil has worked for me in the past, it's not doing for me what it used to. After the fiasco with Wellbutrin, I am not looking forward to trying yet another medication.

With the Wellbutrin XL as part of his regimine, his moods are more even as he only has to take the medication once a day;  with a twice daily medication, he would often forget to take the second dosage so I  love the time release aspect.  He doesn't have any sexual side effects which is great and just has to watch what he eats (low carb diet) to keep the weight off.  I am every pleased with the effect this has had on his depression.

I have a tendency to be anxious and I don't really think it does too much to help with that.  The only side effect is that I feel a bit jittery but feel more alert.  Also, it has definitely cut my appetite which has helped get rid of a little extra weight that I put on over the past year (which I think was due to Zoloft and depression).

Actually it made the anxiety problem twice as bad. Overall it was ok for the depression but I could not maintain an erection for nothing while I was taking this product. Which is due to the anxiety issue caused by this product. One minute I was semi hard and as soon as I would think about my problem, it would just shibble up. Or even if I heard a sound like the wind blow, the party was over. I have stopped taking this product for only a week now and Ole Willie is standing proud again.
The only problem is now I can see a slight depression behavior problem returning and I do not know what to do. I do not want to have issues but if I can't enjoy having a sex life, it's depressing too!"

I started at 75mg 2x/day, and am currently at 100mg 2x/day.  My depression symptoms have subsided and I am more comfortable around people with less irritability.  However, I continue to have anxiety and constant worry (Generalized Anxiety Disorder).  It appears that Wellbutrin does not list this as one of the treatable conditions.  I am considering switching to Prozac instead.  One major plus about Wellbutrin is that it has had no sexual side effects on me, unlike other antidepressants I've tried before such as Paxil and Lexapro.  Also, I haven't had any weight gain from taking Wellbutrin; however, my appetite has increased (I get hungry quicker).  If depression is the only condition to be treated, then I would recommend Wellbutrin.

I've been taking generic Wellbutrin 75mg for less than a week now, and so far it seems to be helping. I'm sometimes groggy in the morning, but it goes away and I feel awake and clear-headed all day. One unusual thing: by evening I sometimes feel anxious, and two nights ago I had a full-blown panic attack and could not stop crying and feeling scared. I had a very stressful day at work though so maybe I can attribute the panic to that. I also notice changes in my appetite, like I will be hungry but not want food, or feel full after three bites of something. My energy level seems better, and I don't feel a lack of sexual desire like I did before the drug. The flat, gray feeling seems to be lessening. Overall, I do feel better, like a fog has been lifted off of me.In two weeks I'll switch to the brand-name version at 150mg, so hopefully things keep improving. Hope this helps!

I was originally prescribed Ritalin but can not take stimulants due to a weird reaction and I developed Tourettes Syndrome.  After years of trial and error with medications I have settled with Strattera 60mg and Wellbutrin XL 150 mg.  They work well together. The Wellbutrin helps with ADHD, depression, and helps balance the irritability I get from strattera, however it does make me more anxious, which is hard to live with.  The Strattera lets me concentrate and my grades are decent in my third year college. 
With any drug there are side affects but after six years the Wellbutrin is still working. It doesn't seem as harsh as other drugs and the weight management is just a bonus.  If I forget to take it my day is not so smooth.

Honestly, it was like putting on a pair of glasses for the first time after not realizing you'd been looking a blurry world.  It did make it easier to get up in the morning, it didn't affect my weight, it didn't affect my sex drive or the quality of sex, AND it really improved my daily depression.  Apparently it is the only anti-depressant that doesn't have any usual sexual side effects, if that's something important to you.

Worked great! In addition, I found it 'energizing' and started wondering if I was dysthymic as well. Found it much easier to get out of bed in the morning and less dependent on drinking coffee to perk up.  I've taken 150mg once a day in the morning for several years and I'm very pleased with the results.  I tried taking the recommended BID dose, but the evening dose would keep me up at night and vivid dreams. I currently feel like the positive effect are slightly wearing off and I would like to slightly increase my dose to 200 mg daily in the AM.  Again, very thankful that I discovered this medication and I think it has helped me tremedously.

I did not tolerate it well at all. The first day was fine, but then the second day I felt ""dopey"" and ended up in bed with a fever later on that night. After that experience I stopped taking it but still had a low fever for a few days. I also had a weird sensation in my head that is difficult to describe. It almost felt as though I was about to lose control and have a seizure. After stopping this too went away. I will say that I am very sensitive to medications, so this may work well for some, just not me or other people with the same sensitivity. If you are sensitive to meds make sure to discuss the risks of this medication with your doctor."

I never felt speedy at all (maybe because this wasn't the first med for me).  
This works pretty well for anxiety, but it would probably work better with therapy (I'm looking for another Dr).  They're probably going to up my dose for ADHD so we'll see how that goes.

I don't cry at everything anymore- in fact, hardly at anything, I'm not as socially aggressive when I get angry, and it takes considerably more to make me angry.  I am still irritable, and that's something I wish would get better, but I'm glad not to be so miserable and ""blah"" everyday... I figure, at least I'm not an emotional wreck and I can at least tolerate some of the things that were making me feel terrible before.  Also, I have definitely experienced decrease in appetite... I don't eat much during the day, but sometimes at night I'll wake up and find myself going to the fridge to make myself a sandwich because I'm so hungry from not eating all day!  Also, I find it more difficult to fall asleep, and normally I go to bed pretty early and have no issues, so it's weird for me.  Other than the appetite and insomnia this med seems ok.

I have been on WellbutrinXL (generic since it became available) and Depakote (ditto) for 12 yrs. Best years of my life by far. Wellbutrin with marginal dose of Depakote keeps me out of any significant depression, while allowing me the very slight hypomania that enhances creativity, productivity, and sociability (like a safe ""6"" or ""6.5"" on a 0-10 scale, zero being suicide).  Sounds like it's not for everyone, but for me personally now, at age 50, seems like I'll gladly take it to my deathbed!"

I started treating my disorder with prozac which threw me completely off balance and gave me severe moodswings. I moved on to Effexor which was effective for a bit over a year but then lost effect. My doctor then changed me to Wellbutrin XL which has been great. While I had no side-effects onthe original brand, I decided to try the generic brand. I gained a lot of weight ad fell a bit into a slump- a doctor I consulted told me the generic brand had a shorter half-life than the original; making it less effective.

Since taking Wellbutrin I am constantly very angry, I react very harshly to things, I feel hateful, I cry at anything and I am lashing out at the ones that love me the most.  I have a constant knot in the pit of my stomach that seems to get worse the later in the day it gets.  I can't do this anymore.  My daughter and I have always had a great relationship but now it seems as if she is hesitant about talking to me about anything because she is unsure how I will react.  I have absolutely no interest in anything intimately, in fact the thought of it makes me cringe.  I will be calling my doctor in the morning and requesting something different.  I can't put my family through this anymore.  There has got to be something out there that will work for me and my symptoms.

It effects dopamine and nuropenephrin (sp?), but doesn't really effect serotonin.  I tried taking Wellbutrin XL by itself and Lexapro by itself...with the former, i had similar anxiety issues that others have mentioned, and I didn't feel that Lexapro did too much for me...plus it made it really hard to orgasm.  i've been on 300 xl and 10 mg for about 2 years now, and it's been a great combo for me.

I have been taking it for only a week, but I am more angry.  I have been lashing out at my 8 and 4 year old.  Extreme anger.  I also have had diarrea. I also will think that I see things out of the corner of my eyes that aren't there.  I now can cry at the drop of a hat.  I do take a generic form of Wellbutrin.  I have been sleeping great!  Other pills that I have taken usually keep you awake a night.  Who knows maybe I have not taken it long enough.  I called my Dr today and he wants me to wait another week.

Wellbutrin, I thought was a lifesaver until I begin to slow down and do ""normal"" things in my life. While being an athlete, I did not have the time to sit down and notice the impact of this medication; however, once becoming a mother, I noticed the zombie in me. I literally felt like a zombie once re-prescribed this medication (I did not take the medication while pregnant). Times where it was perfectly normal for me to cry (like a funeral) I would not cry at all. I was desensitized to the world around me to include my newborn. I immediately took myself off the medication without the guidance of the doctor (bad idea - but at the time it worked for me). I did not have any withdrawal issues, which is a good thing! Nevertheless, I begin to try other medications in hopes of addressing my depression. But, I did not want to go through life feeling numb. In the end, I have turned to herbal treatment which is working wonders for me. I will NOT go back to this medication. I promised myself and those who love me. "

Three days after starting to take 300mg, I broke out in hives just on my face. I couldn't leave the house until they went away!

There seem to be two types of generic pills; I found one didn't help me at all, but the other one (purple colored) was as effective as the brand name version.  I experience shaking hands and constipation from the medication.  It doesn't cause the low sex drive and weight gain that I've experienced with other medications.

I think it is important to note however that this drug caused me to noticeably shake my hands all day. I am a phlebotomist and this had a negative affect on my job. Also, while it takes away the depression, it causes your mind to not really care about anything. Sure, your not depressed, but you become emotionless. Maybe my side effects were due to the combination but I just want to stress the fact that you need to be very careful before just taking what is prescribed to you by the physician. I believe I had TOO much drug therapy.

I have been trying to find somthing to just get me through this time so I can be sane for my family- not to pretend it is not there. I am on my second month on Welbutrin. It took at least a month to kick in. I was irritated easily for the first few weeks, but that went away a few weeks ago. I have lost just a few pounds and I do not feel like a flat line like I did on Lexapro. My sex drive is also still intact, thank God! The only downfall is that every night I get nausea, wich is why for me, it is not easy to use. My doc says to wait it out a few more weeks and make sure to take it every MORNING (I work nights so I took it later) I tried to have two drinks one night, and almost vomitted. I also got airsick for the first time. But I laugh again, and I am ready to be there for my mom now, who will be undergoing a stem-cell transplant soon. The stress is not gone- but I can at least handle it better now.My husband and mom both need me too much for me to wallow in misery all the time. If only I could get rid of the damn nausea! Oh yea, my husband said he noticed my memory has been better. I used to think depression was somthing you could talk yourself out of. Somtimes you have nothing left to give, and that is when it is time to see a doc or counseling to search what is right for you. I hope this helped someone because alot of the others helped me. Good luck!

She was only 42 years old. The psychiatrist prescribed this to also help me deal with my child being hyperactive.

CONS: It made me feel very hot, sweaty, uncomfortable. If I take it in the morning I am tired, if I take it at night I am wide awake. As a mother of toddlers I need my sleep.

PROS:
Helped with anxiety, weightloss, nervousness.

I have learned getting over a death is not easy but with medication, relaxation and talking it out helps.

On the other hand, I am not sure what is worse the anxiety etc. or the terrible sweats and feeling like I have a terrible fever and cannot move at times.

If you are concerend and will not take medication due to weight gain, this is the medication for you."

After trying some different medications and dosages we finally decided on Wellbutrin XL 450mg with Effexor XR 225mg. I've been on this for about 2 years. IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID! My anxiety and anger was gone after a few weeks. I stopped fighting with my husband and co-workers everyday. I was able to take difficult situations in stride. The worst side effect was dry mouth. I will say that after reading some of these reviews I'm terrified to ever go off of the Effexor XR.

I tried stopping this med , thought i didnt need it anymore turns out i do. I had no withdrawal symtoms when stopping it just got really depressed again Iv had weight gain while taking this. Didnt do much for sex drive.to summ it all up, since taking this med i want to be a wife, mother,do my job at work, clean my house all things i wanted no part of before.I will continue to take this med,but i am concerned because i am about to have to switch to generic because i can no longer afford this ""miracle drug' but i will pay what i have to to be able to keep feeling this way its wonderful."

I have no signs of improvement with my depression. It did give me an energy boost to begin with but that only lasted about 3 - 4 months. Most importantly I have realized that a drug can not change the people around you just you. So if your depression is due to things outside of you it will have littel to no effect for you. At next appointment I will be asking to be taken off of it.

1394$Condition: Depression$5/20/2008 4:59:02 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Initially started with Zoloft, which was really good for depression and anxiety. The only thing about Zoloft was, not only did it take away the anxiety...it took away all my emotions!! I was numb. Was not sad, was not happy, just didn't feel anything. A friend of mine's infant died recently, and I was sad for her in my head. I wanted to cry, but couldn't.  It also takes away the libido. Yeah...that sucks. So my doc switched me to Wellbutrin 100mg, and at first, just like a post I read earlier. I felt drugged, tired and wierd. I kept taking it though. It's been about a month, and I love it. It's false happiness in a pill, but I guess that is better than none at all right? I love it !!! I am not as anti-social as I had become. Starting to be myself again, which I thought would never happen.

I recently resumed taking it again after being off of it for almost 6 months due to problems with my insurance. For the past two days I have suffered with horrible anxiety attacks, I had to go to the emergency room yesterday. I have never had anxiety attacks or anxiety problems before. I think I would rather be depressed than experience anything like that ever again. I felt like I was on acid or losing my mind or something. In addition to the new anxiety, it has also caused me to be continuously either constipated or have diahrrea, nothing in between. It also gave me insomnia, which by itself is  manageable but coupled with anxiety it can drive a person insane. I will not take this drug again, even if it means crying out my depressions and talking myself out of suicide. Be careful and be prepared.

However I was taking 150mg of the XL. Within 30 days I was ANGRY and mood swings did not begin to explain it. I switched from 30mg of Cymbalta, being used as a mood swing adjuster. Wellbutrin XL made my life hell for my close friends and family as well as myself. I went off over how beds should be made, to what color shirts were. I'm still dealing with the aftermath of stopping all mood adjustment drugs now. This made me loose myself and control of my actions. Something I never want a drug to do for me. Good luck and please be aware of your actions when your on it. 
1437$Condition: Depression$3/11/2008 12:26:38 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was on this medication for the last two years of high school and 1st year of college. My doctor switched me to wellbutrin sr (which didnt work as well for me) but the time i was on wellbutrin xl, it changed my life! Grades improved, I was getting honors (something I had never gotten before) and I was very very driven and motivated to do things. It helped my concentration so much and my desire to accomplish things in my life. I will give this warning: once being on it for long periods of time I felt great and felt like I didnt need meds anymore. I would stop taking it and within a month later would have horrible episodes from being off of it. This happened to me about three times. Once your on it, it is hard to get off but it definately improved my life. I am now on an SSRI and have found that I have no emotion at all and its hard to feel anything. While on wellbutrin, I still could feel emotions,etc. It didnt take every feeling away from me totally. This is a good drug to take, especially for a teenager, that is when I started it. I attribute all my accomplishments to this drug, I realy would not be where i am today without it and I am looking in to going back on it in combination with my SSRI

I've been on it since it was created. If you want further info you can email me b/c it won't all fit here: [email protected] This drug works for depression & smoking cessation-no doubt. However, don't expect to be able to stop taking it, in my case, perhaps ever. 5 x's I've stopped. The 1st 3 were due to no insurance & by the 3rd I was 'rationing' pills and splitting them in half. The 4th was an attempt to ween myself and the 5th was w/a Dr.'s assistance that Rx'd another drug to ease me off. I CANNOT BE WITHOUT THIS DRUG. It's a horrendous 'rubber band effect' I call the ""crash n burn"". It took awhile for me realize that It may be a month or so after it's out of your system to happen, but it will happen, and it will be harsh. I have taken this drug w/little conjunction of other drugs and know that it works to promote an overall sense of well being. BUT there are side effects [for me-everyone is different and thus cannot be expected to have the exact same experience]. For me I do have dry mouth, periodic insomnia, lower sex drive and constipation (the latter 2 were present before, just intensified by the drug). I feel like a Rx junkie, getting low on this drug causes me to panic. I have hoarded it for ins. changes. You win GSK- you now own me. I hope you're happy and proud of yourself. Despite choosing to be happy and not wanting to rely on a chemical to make that be, I no longer can. Perhaps I'm being too harsh on GSK and I truly have a chemical imbalance that will always need to be corrected??? Could be. I just think the warning should be known of how powerful Wellbutrin really is. Is it a miracle drug or the socially acceptable form of crack or smack? I have developed a love/hate relationship with it at this point in my life. I love to take it and fell good and I hate to take it and feel weak for needing it. Straight up depression just blows. Too indescribable to an outsider about how it actually feels. "

1441$Condition: Depression$3/5/2008 12:47:36 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$4$Before this medication I was absolutley a mess. I was crying almost everyday, on my days off from work I would lay on the couch and would not get up all day. I had stopped going out with friends, gained over 30 lbs, and overall just didn't care about anything. I decided it was time to take action and as much as I thought, oh this is a phase and I will snap out of it, I realized I couldn't do it on my own anymore. I started out at 150 mg and yes, there were side effects. I couldn't sleep at night, I lost my appettite (which I didn't mind), I was alot more anxious and kind of trembly, and I was sweating alot more and really thirsty. At first I was like, I can't do this, I work 12 hours a day I need sleep and food and, etc. These side effects lasted for about 2 months. For the sleeping issues I started taking this medication right when I woke up in the morning, about 5:30 am. I noticed that this helped me have more energy through the day and wore off toward the evenings but, still I was only sleeping like 4 hours a night. I started taking Xanax and Ambien, not together and not every night, but this helped alot. I have been on this medication for almost a year now, my doctor upped my dose to 300mg, I am soooo much more motivated, happy, and I have found me again.I have lost over 20 lbs and like I said this medicine gives me energy and the motivation to workout now and care about what I look like. The nervous, anxious, trembling feeling has gone away. I still sweat a little moe than usual and am thirsty but, it is not a major thing to me, I have adjusted. I would really recommend this mediaction to anyone who was having the symptoms of depression like I was. And, those symptoms weren't at certain times in the season or just every once in a while, yes they were worse during winter then summer. I was on a roller coaster of emotions up and down and I needed major help. Give this med. a try, ride out the side effects if you can, it is worth it in the end!!!!

I have no negative side effects. If anything, my side effects are positive - increased sex drive and slight weight loss. I'm on 300mg currently and probably need to up it a little as I still get depressed occasionally. All other drugs I've taken have made me extremely lethargic and disconnected. I have none of that with Wellbutrin.

I had been severely depressed for over a year, and bad circumstances beyond my control that happened in 2007 made it even worse.  I have to say that after the first month on Wellbutrin (and therapy), however, I am feeling great.  It is also a great energy booster and I feel like I'm accomplishing much more than I had for so long.
BUT...I have a terrible time trying to sleep.  Even with taking a sleeping pill, I average 4-5 hours of sleep a night.  While I don't want to stop taking Wellbutrin, the insomnia is a real problem, and as of yet my doctor and I haven't found a way to overcome it. "

Yes, I was sad but thought it was because of circumstances in my life at the time.  He prescribed Wellbutrin XL.  Wow, I can't believe how it evened out my mood.  My life is once again normal.  It takes the rough edge off and I am much nicer to be around.  I do have to watch my weight though, seems to have put some pounds on.  That's minor to losing friends, a marriage and even the dog feared me.  Wellbutrin has saved my marriage for sure.

I take Wellbutrin XL in the morning and Lexapro at night.  I was a little nervous starting it again because of what it did the last time, but I am having no problems with it this time. Id recommend it but only in conjunction with something else. I also go to therapy now, so maybe that is one reason why the effect is different now than before.

It worked and I don't smoke anymore. Then I realized I like the new me and realized I had undiagnosed depresion. After 2 years of taking it I went to a new OB-GYN for my yearly and she inadvertantly changed me to Wellbutrin XL (it stays in your system twice as long as the SR). I didn't think anything of it as I am a RN and work in a pharmacy where the standard is the XL dose. After 3 1/2 to 4 months I started having blurry vision(I had LASIK 2 1/2 years ago), nausea, diarrhea, dizzyness, then anxiety, jittery, then shaky and rapid heart rate with missed beats. So bad that one day I clocked out and went to the ER. My heart was racing at 120-135 beats per minute. They sent me home on a Holter monitor to record my heart and it came back with frequent sinus tachycardia with occasional premature atrial and ventrical beats. Not realizing the drug switch, I was positive that my thyroid was out of wack. Had all the tests even changed doctors since I didn't think the first doc was doing enough. Finally I asked an eye doctor if Wellbutrin could be causing my vision problems and he told me to get it changed. I start a new medication in the morning, so we will see if it works for me.

However, I sometimes have trouble sleeping. I have stared to lose weight slowly -- four pounds after two months of ues.I am going to add more dietary changes and hope to lose more weight. I am a bit concerned about getting more sleep since I often awaken after a few hours sleep--as little as three hours but sometimes more. I usually get up and read or go on line for a while and then sleep again for maybe three hours. I  am going to try getting some exercise to see if that helps.

When this drug was in my system after about 5 wks, my depression sunk to the lowest EVER; mood swings were almost out of control, very unlike my character, to where eventually I felt suicidal and completely hopeless like life was just not worth living.  I called the dr ofc told them this drug was evil!  That I flushed it down the toilet.  It scared the you know what out of me... I am currently on Zoloft 50mg now, and that is working great for me.  WXL is scary, atleast it was for me. I feel like ""me"" again on what I'm now on. "

I think many of the side affects are caused by lack of sleep while ""adjusting"" to this medicine. Seretonin is what keeps our Sanity, and is only produced when we sleep well, 8 hrs. For Smoking, I am surprised how my breakfast and coffee does not include a Cigarette afterwards. I will set a target date to quit after 2 months. This does not remove my anxiety or panic attacks like Paxil did, they must affect the mind differently. I am concerned about the possibility of a seizure on this medication as I am also a Drinker.

Slowly tappering off Effexor at the same time.  Effexor caused me to crave sugar and alcohol (sweet vodka coolers) everyday.  I was never a drinker, just socially glass of wine.  Gained 35 lbs in 4 months, 124lbs to 165lbs, very depressing.  Now on Wellbutrin I have no cravings at all, even coffee, and my mood is much better,eating healthy and a week without drinking.  Hopefully continues.

However, Wellbutrin has the least side effects, and I don't feel like I'm taking an antidepressant.  I simply feel the absence of the extremely depressed feelings.

Although I occaisionally feel agitated on this medication I found that it gives that ""motivation in a pill"" effect I've been hoping for. It has also helped me to stop smoking. It is very nice to wake up and have the motivation to do the dishes and clean up and feed my son a healthy breakfst instead of laying around on the couch or smoking a cigarette first thing. I felt that it gave me an ""attitude problem"" when i was first given this medication for depression, but coupled with Effexor it is a dream come true for my ADHD symptoms. While on this medication my migrane headaches have gone away COMPLETELY and my overall blood pressure has lowered. My work has been more satisfying and less of a burden and it is easier to wake up at an ungodly hour to be there. I was also a habitual user of pot before starting this medication and have stopped smoking pot and cigaretters almost effortlessly. "

After spending a year getting off of it, and another year trying to stay off of Anti-depressants altogether (cognitive therapy as alternative) I threw in the towel and sought 'something new' from healthcare provider.  Aside from forgetting to take it some days, I seem to tolerate it well.  I've not exactly been happy-go-lucky, but considering the despair I'd experienced during the preceding year, I feel it's been effective overall.  I'm not where I want to be yet, but I can conceive of 'getting there' - which is major progress in my book.

I was generally in good moods and my moodswings were less intense. After about five months it stopped working, so my doctor put me on 300mg. There is a noticable difference in moods depending on whether you take it in the morning or at night. Taking it in the morning was difficult to remember, so i resumed taking it at night with my Seroquel. It is a stimulant and could be good for use in the morning if you are a morning person-- no one likes being awake but grumpy in the morning. Overall, i like this drug. It has been the most effective anti-depressant I have taken in a span on 6 years.

I am a generally happy person, and work on a lot of projects.  I can see the glass half full or half empty.  WellbutrinXL oral helps me see the glass half full.
I have tried several other anti-depressants, including one that is supposed to help for chronic pain.  That one had too many sexual side effects.  The other one had a weight gain factor.  One of them made me MORE depressed.  One made me tired.  WellbutrinXL oral allowed me to have energy, lose a small amount of weight, I had no sexual side effects, and was able to wake up in the morning.  It gave me more energy than the rest of them.

In fact, this medication has an unpleasant odor and taste when taking.  I have to take an acid reflux med to keep from throwing up, and it doesn't always work.  The meds work, but hurt my tummy.  I am diabetic II under control.  I dread the a.m. and evening meal, as I have to eat and then take the meds ---except for the welbutrin in the evening.  I've been diagnosed since August, 2007, so I'm still working on everything.  I do not like throwing up anywhere, and especially at school.  I teach school.  To help, I take Lithium Carbonate 300 mg. twice daily.  I also take Glucophage 1000 mg. twice daily.  I take Calcium Citrate + D twice daily.  In addition, 20 mg. of Crestor at night.  (My cholestrol is at 200.)  I take AcipHex, 20 mg., of the morning.  I take 15 mg. of Dalmane to sleep.  However, I do not take the Dalmane or Crestor with the night pills.

As far as I can tell, the Welbutrin is working -- when I can keep it down.  I do think it is a combination of pills.  The Lithium is new since August ---- I had been on Depacote since 1999.  If you have any suggestions on which pills to take, and then the others to help the nausea, please feel free to advise.  Thank you for listening to me!"

Doc Rx wellbutrin, and ALL habits stopped, INCLUDING wanting to be married(nearly 30 years) and being a parent to my children.  I became manic and cried ALL the time.  I stopped the wellbutrin, but these 'habits' have been damaged.  ALTHOUGH I don't know exactly how this med works, I know it's responsible for my dramatic change in personality, which is not good.

It has worked very well. Not only do I feel much happier, I have more energy too. Plus I lost 20lbs. I don't think the Wellbutrin directly caused the weight loss, but I think it gave me more energy and more of a desire to do things, which caused the weight loss

Zoloft actually had me contemplating suicide and Effexor had me gaining so much weight I physically felt just as bad as I did mentally. I tried others too before finally trying this one. The biggest plus was that I've LOST weight, cravings were drastically reduced, and my libido wasn't compromised. That was truly wonderful!

After smoking for 18 years...I quit.  Yes, it did cause some nausea at first...however you must eat when taking this medication.  Take with meals.  Also, don't give up.  It also has a side effect which decreases hunger.  I lost weight after quitting smoking...about 10 lbs.  I was scared after quitting smoking I would gain.  I didn't I lost.  This medication is a wonder drug.  It is rough in the begining as your body adjust.  It's not fun but give it time the side effects will go away and it is effective overall.  I really support the use of this drug.  I am an RN and also think if this drug does not help with smoking cessation try Chantix.  I am an Open Heart Nurse and we have had great success with our patients on Chantix.

I recently was prescribed wellbutrin due to anxiety and addiction to cigarettes. I took it for 3 weeks and yes quit smoking but had more anxiety than ever and more depression. I had many fits of out of control crying and anger. My boyfriend brought the medication I was on to my attention because he knew that i was a little on the emotional side but not possessed. I even had a week long outbreak of hives. Although I am only 90% sure this was the medications fault. I was so distracted at all the other stuff I was going through I did not crave cigarettes and as far as drinking was involved I got sick after two drinks so I am taking a vacation from alcohol as well. I still have hives on and off so hopefully in another 24 hours the medication should be completely out of my system and hopefully hive free. I will finally be able to breath peacefully and with out a cigarette in my hand."
