I was prescribed this drug as an alternative to opiate pain medication twice in the last 10 years. Not only was this drug not effective for that use, but both times I experienced severe sexual dysfunction within the first month of use. Both times I had to stop use of the drug. I recovered sexual function after the first use 10 years ago, but after the second use within the last year I have never recovered from the sexual dysfunction. All males should be made aware of this possible side effect by their Doctors. Sadly in my case neither of my providers did so.

Iâ??ve always delt with depression, with my second pregnancy had bad postpartum depression. I was on Wellbutrin for a while, but it wasnâ??t helping much. This has worked. It took a couple weeks to adjust to the medication, but now the only side effect I have is dry mouth that forces me to drink lots of water, which is a good thing.

11$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$8/15/2017 1:10:26 PM$Reviewer: Dan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I have been taking this med (40mg daily) for 4 years now to treat stomach/gastro pain after surgery damaged my vega nerve, and it has been a blessing. My life was pure misery before due to severe pain after every meal. I lost weight, couldn't sleep. This med began working for me within a couple of days and I'm grateful for it. But there are negatives, as well: chronic constipation, dry mouth, foggy thinking at times. Also, I learned early on to take the med at least 2-3 hours before bed to avoid nightmares. 
But I deal with those negatives because the alternative is too awful. Best of luck to everyone struggling with NP.  "

I am also VERY dizzy when I get up after watching tv. I was caught by my husband when I fell into the wall going into the kitchen towards the rest room. I find I need to use the bathroom more often but not much happens. I have severe cramping in my abdomen but that could be from anything at this point. I take for migraines and nerve pain due to my syringomelia. I had severe headaches and random muscle spasms before taking. I was so used to the headaches before that they just became a part of normal life. I didn't get a single one in the first 10 days taking this med but I had forgotten how BAD tey were when one showed up. I switched my RX in my glasses and am headache free again...Just conserned that my vision with ""switch back"" as soon as I stop taking the drug."

Not only did the drug NOT help with the pain nor help as a sleep aid but, in fact, made matters worse. The pain that had focused  on my lower limbs was now throughout my body. Shivers, aches, and tingling from head to toe. Hallucinations and severe anxiety were also a nice side effect that I was not expecting. When I mentioned this to the doctor she was alarmed but not terribly surprised. This drug may work for some  but it definitely did NOT work for me. Thumbs down from me I am sorry to say.

I do everything to manage my weight as my normal weight is 108-110, I dropped to 98lbs and gained back 8lbs over night while taking this drug. I don't sleep at night stay up until 3-4 AM and this is why my (PCP) doctor prescribed this drug to help fall asleep and stay asleep. I informed him today it makes me feel drugged out all the next day and weight gain. I am honest with my PCP and I stopped taking this medication before symptoms get any worse. There are other medications that will help sleep until then I'll continue taking a Xanax 2mg that I've been on for 20 years. :I don't take on normal bases 4X daily, take only when I feel shaky from withdraws, cut my own self down to 2 a day, so taking one at bedtime and drinking more water should help.

Been a while since I took it, but I remember it's mild calmative effects & how that helped me quit drinking. Once-upon-a time I had such a bad drinking problem that I needed 12+ beers just so I could sleep at night - and so I wouldn't go into DT's. One night I discovered that taking Pamelor (nortryptaline) with just one can of beer allowed me to get a nice refreshing sleep without DT's. Eventually I was able to quit drinking altogether. Granted, nortryptaline isn't indicated for that use specfically, but that's what it did for me. It's very mild, it's relaxing and effective for many things.

I rated this medication as an overall 4 because when you wake up with a headache every day or your headache wakes you up in the middle of the night, relief on any level is a good thing! Hoping this medication will be more effective with time.

The 25 mg dose was extremely ineffective in treating my headaches. I also expierence side effects such as dry mouth, peeing more often, weight gain, loss of appetite, and mood swings.

I thought I had hit gold because right away I was sleeping better without my pain.  Within a short amount of time (although I did not connect it until recently) I became confused and extremely anxious. After a month and a half of taking this med, I checked myself into the hospital.  Of course, no one connected my symptoms with the medicine and instead said I had an anxiety and mood disorder.   I was then put on a lot of new medicines.

With the lithium (3 weeks now) I'm not crying as much, still very emotional but able to hold it in better. Ive tried numerous medications and either feel worse or don't feel any different at all...like I may as well not even be taking anything. I always seem to have no problem gaining weight though.

5 months ago I was prescribed Nortryptiline. This medication has changed my life. I take 20 MG at night. My headaches still happen, but nothing compared to the last 3 years. My appetite was actually surpressed instead of experiencing weight gain. My overall nerve pain has decreased. The only time I feel pain is when my medication wears off. I also take Tramadol 2 X per day and 50 Mg of Zoloft once per day. The Nortryptiline and Tramadol combo is the best for my situation. My mood has also been very positive and I have most energy back.

I've been on nortriptypine for over 5 years now and it is the best anti-depressant I've ever tried by far. I actually sleep for the first time in my life without waking up with panic attacks. Getting a good night's sleep alone has probably done wonders for my depression and anxiety. Sometimes I do feel a bit more tired when I do wake up but it's worth the good sleep. I do have some annoying side effects like increased heart rate, dry mouth, and flushing/red skin but they are worth the results I get. I haven't had a manic episode in years and am able to control and re-direct negative emotions much more effectively than I ever have. I really thank the one psychiatrist that suggest this medication to me, it changed my life.

Effectiveness: it worked a little for the pain (severe migraines)

Satisfaction: Would definitely NOT recommend this drug. The side effects were horrible. I had hallucinations about a week after starting to use it. I also started to have a hard time getting back to a normal sleeping schedule while using it. My anxiety was higher than normal. And I'm very sorry to say that after 2-3 weeks I started having suicidal thought, had a seizure, and then had to be rushed to the hospital in intensive care for 3 days.

The medication did help with the pain, but the side effects were far too much for my body to handle. It also didn't help that I didn't have an attentive doctor. I certainly don't think everyone will react this badly from the medication, but I highly advise that you have a doctor that doesn't underplay the possible side effects if you choose to use it. If you are using it and start to have odd side effects after a week please report them immediately and don't think they'll get better (for me they just got worse). And if you're doctor thinks you're overreacting, seek a second opinion or go to the hospital. I wish I was never given this drug, it nearly killed me."

I believe that it has also helped my other chronic pains as well. I may have gained some weight and have chronic constipation as side effects of this medication, but it is well worth it!

I now require 10-12 hours of sleep.  I can fall asleep at any time.  I have no motivation to do anything fun or entertaining.  The first week, I was severely depressed.  The second week, my need for sleep went from 10-12 hours to 8-10 hours.  It slightly increases anxiety.  It does not improve concentration.  No one has mentioned that it increased depression and anxiety while decreased motivation and never touched concentration, so I thought I was going crazy or maybe just having a rough personal life.  This is week 3 now, and I still have yet to see this medication benefit my life.  I also find it strange that people take it for neuropathic pain, because I have had one hell of an eye ache since I've started.  There is a warm sensation... which is a benign side effect.  The only other side effect I have experienced is nightmares and vivid dreams.  The worst side effect has been the depression, and the most annoying has been the increased need for sleep.  I may have gained some weight from an increase in desire for sweets.  For some, this would be a deal-breaker, but if I can sit down and do something productive for once, it would all be worth it.  My form of ADHD is not untreatable... other medications with high side effect profiles have worked.  I have yet to try Selegiline, and recent studies are looking positive for the treatment for Adult ADHD.  I will move on from this drug once the pills run out and still have found no obvious benefit.  I have yet to find someone with only ADHD-PI benefit from this drug.  I honestly don't see how it would benefit those suffering from depression, I have had quite a miserable experience so far, especially that first week.

185$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$5/15/2011 5:42:20 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$2$Chronic migraines, chronic pain, and depression. After reading others symptoms, I was apprehensive about taking this drug. I was unable to work or do much of anything between the constant pain and provoking migraines so severe they would require hospitalization only after I had vomited everything possible to allow travel. i could often not slow or stop them with the best migraine meds, and they would continue for days or even weeks right prior to starting nortriptyline. The side affects can be intense at first. I was started at 40mg 1 hour before bed. Each week I increased 20 or 25mg til i was at 100mg. My miraines were gone (now only minor headaches controlled with a couple advil) and i was back at work 4-6 hours a day. However, the side effects were unbearable, I thought I would have to stop. I didnt even know who I was or what I was doing, thoughts raced, I had to hang on to things often until my balance was stable, my stomach was beyond constipation, mouth was so dry i had to keep water and gum close day and night, and it took all of my focus to drive or try to communicate with anyone. I truly felt like I was losing my mind at this dose. My dose dropped to 75mg and within a few days everything came back into focus. Every symptom lessened to an acceptable level and I was still working most of the time and free of migraines. The only problem now was I had severe depression from the injury i had been trying to recover from for over four years. So under doctors care I slowly incresed dose 25mg. to where I am now at 150mg. (This medicine treats depression at 100mg and higher dose) With each increase side effects worsen temporarely but managabley, and you can always decrease dose until you can manage. Work with your Dr. You will probably also need to see a physcologist to help you stay grounded if you are prescribed higher doses. I am now working full time and still able to enjoy a few light activities. A good diet and exercise are essential. May the Lord bless you!

I couldn't tell any difference for sure, it was subtle, but the drug made my throat way down my neck sore inside. I stopped taking it, sore throat went away. I started it up again, sore throat came back. Sore throat is what I'd call moderate, but was pretty uncomfortable. Doctor said to quit taking the med due to the sore throat, that the sore throat could indicate something (very complex) and that I should stop taking the med. After I stopped taking it a few days later the tinnitus got noticeably worse. At this point I realized the drug had worked some and had made the symptoms less severe, but it was no cure. Sore throat was slower to go away the 2nd time coming off the drug. Sore throat is not a normal one caused by a virus etc., it's deep down in my throat. Also felt irritable and tired after coming off the drug which is somewhat odd considering the extremely small dosage of 10mg. Perhaps it was just my annoyance at it not working better for me.

My does started from 1 pill and progressed to a final dosage of 3 pills at bedtime. My migraine frequency went from 8-10 per month to 3-4 per month. It was a blessing however, it has caused severe gastro problems for me. I have tried several OTC remedies. So now after 3 months of use, my doc is pulling me off and trying something different. The side effects outweighed the pro's in this case but I encourage any migraine sufferers to try the Topimax/nortriptilyne combo. Perhaps you won't have the side effects I had to the extent that I am having them. I also had a huge decrease of libido and have gained a few pounds. It figures that I find a med that helps my core problem and causes many other problems :(

Good as anti-depressant also as in last 4 mths I have been Dx'd w/ COPD, obstructive sleep apnea & breast cancer but I still find joy everyday.

Not from this med, but there's nothing like sleeping w/ a face mask blowing 22mph into mouth for sleep apnea to make your mouth dry (even w/ a humidifier). Mood swings?

I have run the gammet of drugs over the years to no avail.  However, I was able to control my moods until a divorce.  
At the age of 29 I had my first majoy episode,, and was treated with drugs and therapy for a short period.  A new wife helped greatly for a while.  I used alcohol to treat myself for many years, but graduated from AA and the depression came back
Due to a turn coat friend, I had my third episode sober, smoking free, and off drugs.  I for the first time could not take life as it was and took an overdose of Xanax.  Luckyly it was discovered immediatedly and I was cleaned out and sent to lock up for 7 days observation.  I came out taking 300mg of Wellbutrin for 3 years and 1 year of therapy.  However, the occassional thought of suicide  still occured.  My doctor put me on 50mg of Nortriptyline at night along with Clomapin for anxiety and 300 mg of Wellbutrin during the day.  I now sleep through the night and am a little weak in the mornings with a dry mouth, but it get better as the day goes by.  I solved the constipation by taking 3-4 magnesiom tables daily.  My suicidal thought are under control as I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't have that many days left on earth and I want to finally enjoy them.  A little dry mouth or constipation I can handle, suicide I cannot handle.  It is a premanent solution for a temperary problem.  "

All the info I have found (and spoke to pharmacist) say this is VERY rare.  My doctor told me this is not true but it is the newest meds I take so I say it has to be the reason.  I just cannot find out the long term affects if I continue taking this medicine as my doctor has suggested.  Anyone know?  The breast pain is unbearable.  I enjoy that my breast got bigger but the pain is not worth it.

I was taking 10-15 OTC pain relievers a day for the regular headaches and would have to go to the emergency room once a month or so to get an injection for migraines that would knock me out till the next day. I'm down to about 2-3 regular headaches a week and I'll still get a migraine about every 2-3 months (and I have Relpax for that now). So for what it was prescribed to do, it has done great. The side effects I have noticed are trouble sleeping, bouts of dizziness and decreased sex drive. I was also diagnosed with depression in '95 and have been on several different meds over the years, but have not been on anything for that for about 4 years. Since I started the Nortriptyline over a year ago, 50 mg at night, my depression is actually coming back. I just read today that Nortriptyline is also used for depression, but up to 3 times the dosage I am taking for headaches. I will be talking with my DR about my options going forward since my depression (bad enough that I feel I need to go back on a medication)is now a reoccurring thing that is coming around way more often than I (and my family) am comfortable with.
But for the headaches, this has been the only med that gives me this much relief.          "

It did help me function b/c I had depression and anxiety and insomnia. I was able to go to college and get a job but after many years on it I developed problems.  I now have gastroparesis and IBS. Most DR.s say this med helps the stomach but slows the intestines but since I've been off it 5 months all of my problesm with digestion  from swallowing all the way down to eliminating have improved. I had also developed reoccurring infections in my lymph nodes and exhaustion to the point of sleeping 17 hours a day. This too has improved but not gone away since being off the med. I'm guessing that my body has changed as I have aged making this not the right medicine for me anymore but it helped for many years. When I first started it it was a relief to me not to wake in the middle of the night in full blown panic attacks, and to feel calmer. No other med has worked as well but I have to say goodbye b/c the infections in my lymph nodes and the exhaustion is too much to deal with. Some people say they felt foggy on it but I never did. I felt electrified without it, and normal with it. It calmed me, and in emergencies, it really stopped full blown panic attacks. Dr.s say I shouldn't take it as it is dangerous but what antidepressant isn't? Am considering Lexapro now, but after being drug free for 5 months I feel physically healthier and am wondering if the trade off is worth it. I am depressed. I have no....no desire to do anything. No drive. No hope. No pill is magic but what if it helps? No way to know but to try. As long as it isn't liver/heart/kidney/nervous system damaging I guess comming off would stop the negative effects. Plus I'm waiting to completely come back from the Cymbalta which nearly killed me.

316$Condition: Depression$7/18/2009 9:18:35 PM$Reviewer: ddprib, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$The primary reason of me taking this is for sleep deprivation with a secondary reason for depression.  Prior to this medication, I was taking (3) 50mg tablets of amitriptyline at dinner as they take quite awhile to take effect. Amitriptyline definately works better than the Nortriptyline for sleep if taken at dinner time and not bedtime. I take Zanax 3 times a day also, so I don't know if they cause anxiety.  I had to get off of the Amitriptyline because it makes it very difficult to get up at an early time like going to work.  The Amitriptyline started making me listless and depressed during the day also and then my Dr. put me on Nortriptyline as it makes it easier on getting up in the morning and having more energy during the day.  I would advise anybody taking Nortriptyline or Amitriptyline to read all the precautions here on WebMD as it gave me alot of information of all of the side effects along with other health problems you may have as Diabeties, etc.that is listed and let your Dr. know about many other body issues you may have including Diabeties, etc. I am more well of on Nortriptyline than Amitriptyline, unless you just want to sleep night and day.  In closing, I just urge you to read all of the information they provide here on WebMD. About 90% of the info. provided between the 2 medicines is the same.

Two weeks ago, I was stepped down to 25mg/day, and the side efects have almost disappeared.  If the 25mg dose can continue to stave off my migraines, I'll be a very happy camper.

The first few days I was using it I felt very tired in the afternoon, But after about a week it really started to help lessen the symtoms of my condition. Less anxiety, no aches or pain, better consentraction/focus, more energy, happier, less irratable, more ease falling asleep, and I was do much better in school. When ever I exercise or reading I felt a pleasant tingling sensation, a side effect but an enjoyable one. Exercising also increased the benefits of the medication. The side effects usually were not to bad, dry mouth and strange taste in the morning, dizziness after standing up, faster heartbeat, and slightly high blood pressure. I never had any sexual problems, but I have noticed a lowered sex drive. About 1 to 2 times a month at night after taking my dose I start to have what I would describe as ""closed-eye visuals"", very strange and sometimes scary, I also sometimes wake in the night and when I started to fall back asleep after a brief amount of time I would feel an unpleasant strong ""prickly"" felling in my brain, followed by the strange dreams, which seemed overpowering as if I was still awake.

Until I read other reviews on this site, I could not figure out where the weight gain was coming from.  I also dream like there is no tomorrow between this medication and the amitryptilene I am also taking.  I was on 50 mg of each 1 time per day and I have now cut back to 25 mg of each/day, hoping to still manage my pain but lose the weight gain....It seems there is always a trade off when taking any medication; a symptom is treated and others pop up.

363$Condition: Depression$1/21/2009 2:46:52 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) $1$1$4$My mother was taking this medicine for her depression. She was on it for a little over a year. She committed suicide while on this medication...ironically...this medication is what she used for the suicide...she took an intentional overdose. I suppose that everyone is different and responds different to medication but I have read some other's comments about extreme mood changes in their loved ones. Then there are other reports stating everything is working great. I have always found it strange that the very medications they use to treat depression can actually make it worse. Most antidepressants now actually have warnings about causing a deeper level of depression and actually causing thoughts of suicide in some people...even in those who have never considered suicide previously. Doesn't make sense to me...but I am not a doctor nor a chemist who make these drugs. Hooray to those of you that find relief in this medicine and I have deep sympathies for those who have seen themselves or their loved ones go further downhill. It is rough to witness someone's pain and suffering like that.

I could not balance my check book, write checks and then send them off.  I do medical transcription and I was unable to do that.  I told my doctor of the symptoms and asked about the nortriptyline.  He again was not worried about the medication.  I was sent for several MRIs in various parts of my body.  At no time did anyone suggest the nortriptyline was to blame and I was not in any condition to think what the problems were caused by.  Finally, I accidentally forgot to take the nortriptyline for a week and began to feel better, at which point I realized that the nortriptyline had been the culprit all along.

I am insisting that I be taken off this medication since it scares me to have my heart rate so high, especially since I work out almost every day and it's almost impossible to keep my heart rate in the 'zone' when it's so high to start with.

I started with Neurontin, Lyrica, and Cymbalta. None of them helped the pain. I had some success with amitryptyline for about 3 months 2 years ago. It gradually quit working. I tried to avoid taking opiates but had no other options. I started with 5mg hydrocodone 4/day. Because of constipation the neurologist switched to oxycodone. He upped the dosage to 7.5mg 4/day then 10mg 4/day. This helped a lot for about a year. I then gradually felt the pain coming back. I switched neurologists for another opinion. She lowered the oxycodone to 7.5 and I started with 25mg/day Nortriptyline then 50mg and finally 75mg. After a week at 75 mg I began having trouble urinating. It got so bad that I couldn't go for almost 8 hours. I'm back to my primary care tomorrow to talk about other alternative treatments. I have seen a pain mgmt specialist he wants me to see another neuro and possibly get setup with the Spinal Cord Stimulation unit. I'm fearful of that until someone convinces me that it is safe. I am so tired of all this. I have been to over a dozen doctors and none seem to understand or care about chronic pain.

But I've been researching this medication more and have noticed that my headaches could possibly be related to depression (not sure). I've noticed that I'm a lot happier now, and just today (after about 2 weeks of being on it) I didn't get a headache all day. So I finally feel that the medication is taking effect. My doctor also had put me on the lowest dose possible, and after my MRI's and MRA's my headaches were still unknown and the medication wasn't working with only one pill a night. So she upped my dose to 2 pills a night and it's been working amazingly.

Have taken SSRIs, and an MAOI with little success. This medication has increased my fatigue, so that I'm sleeping 12+ hrs a day, and still feel tired. Instead of solely decreasing the depression, the med seems to numb all of my emotional responses.  I am less tearful but more apathetic. Also I've noticed increased irritability. 

I have had ongoing headaches seemingly related to the depression and tension, and haven't noticed any difference in the severity or frequency of those headaches since taking the medication. 

I've had extremely dry mouth and increased thirst since starting the medication, along with increased appetite.  I've only been on the medication a short period of time (two weeks), but I think that my doctor will probably take me off the medication when I go back for my next appointment. "

It helped with the migraines already. Today I had a break down though. I feel so depressed and just want to cry. I also have dry mouth and am a little ""up"" not quite hyper but just going faster. I have a little blurred vision. I hope this will all go away soon. Hopefully it won't get worse."

Within a few days, it has worked somewhat, i feel there is a headache there, but it doesnt feel as bad and feels like something is trying to mask the pain. But none-the-less it does help for the most part, as I have since only had 2 headaches.

421$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$3/16/2008 10:24:06 PM$Reviewer: Solice,  Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I had severe headaches that would last 24/7 for weeks at a time.  I was at the end of my rope.  The only way I could stop the pain was to go to the hosiptal and get a Compazine i.v.  I'd go home and sleep it off and a day later the headache would come back.  If I weren't a mother I would have considered ending it. Absolutely nothing else worked. When I started taking this drug I had very strange dreams at first. You might want to start on a low dose and work up to a higher dosage.  This medication helped my headaches within 24 hours. If you are desparate enough you will try anything and the dreams were weird, but I'd choose them over the pain anytime.  The dreams went away and now if I miss the medication for 2 or more days the headaches come back.  It is a lifesaver.

For a couple of week's I felt good. Then I rebounded back with Depresion and Anxiety. Not that any of the other drugs helped much. Trazadone did for awhile. then the side effects kicked in. When I stopped the drugs, I started having brain freezes. little shocks evry time I moved my eyes or head. Sometimes 40-50 a minute. They lasted for about 6 weeks. Tey didn't stop until my Dr. (a new Dr.) had me start Nortriptyline. He started me on 10mgs, which is a very, very small dose. The brain freezes stopped right away. It took a little time and I have worked up to 50 mgs. I am not depressed hardly at all anymore. My anxiety is still there but is managable. My outlook on things is a lot better. Besides a little blurred vision, I am not having any side effects.

I was waking up w/ panic attacks in the middle of the night, but now the Nortriptylin has helped w/ that part of it.  But I am still feeling lightheaded, weak and fatigue throughout the day.  I have been told that all of these are side effects, but how long do the side effects last?  I am only taking 10 mg each night and have been for the past 5 days.  Do the side effects generally last longer than 1 week?  Help me.  Will I ever feel better?  Thank you.

I've had dosage increased twice and both times with superb effectiveness. However, the numbness on my right forearm and tingling suggest that I might need to increase dosage again which probably will not happen.  I might have to go to another scription or have another scription added to the nortriptyline to make it more effective.
Overall, I would love for my body to be able to use this drug because it is so effective for both the tingling and numbness caused by the neuropathy."
