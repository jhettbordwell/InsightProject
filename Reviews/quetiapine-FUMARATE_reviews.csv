2$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/9/2019 12:43:38 PM$Reviewer: I Need A Vacation, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$3$I've been on this for 5 days now and all I want to do is sleep. Have a difficult time getting out of bed in the morning. I don't feel depressed but I'm still agitated with everything.  I feel like I'm in a fog and cant think clearly.  I started out with 50mg until last night and now I'm on 100mg.  Still feel groggy and I've noticed that I can't talk without stumbling.  I think I'm going to call my doctor and request a different drug.  I just don't feel right on this. Have a dry mouth and throat, tired, head fog, agitated feeling, dizzy and just overall not feeling well. In the past the drugs that worked the best didn't make me feel like this at all.  They worked great from the start but eventually stopped working which is why I'm on this one.  Need a replacement.

It made me very angry, full of rage, and plain mean beyond irritable. This was not environmentally induced, for I seldom interacted with others because of the extent of my depression.

8$Condition: Manic-Depression$1/3/2019 7:29:58 AM$Reviewer: AshleyHerbert, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$3$2$"I thought I'd post my review on this drug as it has its benefits but for me, the negatives have far outweighed them, I'm not slowly coming off the tablets and have gone from 200mg to 25mg and should be off them totally in a month or two.

I was prescribed these in May 2018 after a difficult time and they helped me for the first couple of months, however, the past few months I've been unable to wake up, I never feel rested and I have zero energy, this is a drastic change for me as I was previously a gym bunny eating a clean, high calorie diet.

I was taking this alongside, Pregabalin 200mg (now stopped) and Citalopram 40mg (now 30mg).

My review is just to share my experience and to see if anyone else shares the same side effects as it's had a massive impact on my lifestyle both inside and outside of work. 

Hopefully my GP can find something more suited."

Low Dosage 1x/day: 7.5mg 30 days, 15mg 30 days, 25mg 30 days then 37.5mg 30 days.

Can not take it at bed time, I'm awake 3 to 5 hrs.  Started taking in the morning with Lamotrigine 200mg 1x/day.

Just realized this time of day will not work for me. I nod out sitting on the toilet or when I'm on my computer after the 3 to 5 hrs has passed.

Will start taking with my dinner meal and see how it works.

Effectiveness - wow!  Disabling depression is in the past.

Started to have ""desire"" again to get out, enjoy, do things of interest and even get more focused.  Main thing is just having feelings again.

Low ratings for ease of use is due to figuring out the timing of when to use this med. Thus, little bit lower satisfaction.

Recommend this if you're able to handle all the drowsiness!

23$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/23/2016 5:27:36 PM$Reviewer: I feel good, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$3$Started taking 200mg along with Lamectal. Within 20 minutes I was so tired I could hardly talk. I no longer had high/low but I felt like a zombie-no emotions at all, always tired and dragging, no desire to do anything. Decreased to 100mg and felt emotionally better but still had a hard time completing tasks. Here it is 7 years later with a new doctor. After learning more about the side effects I decided I had had enough. We made a plan to get off quetiapine- SLOWLY to prevent a manic/depressive episode. It took 6 months and I am totally off it. I had to retrain myself to fall asleep drug-free but I did it. I feel 100% better! My head's not foggy, I have energy, projects are actually getting completed. This does not feel like the manic highs I've experienced before. I just feel good. Like a new lease on life. Do your research and talk with your doctor before taking this drug.

And while it's still a bit painful to get out of bed, once I do I no longer feel ""stoned."" There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

Days one through five were as follows: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg.  Then it was a matter of getting my body acclimated to 400 mg, which I thought would never happen. 

If you are able to take vacation/sick days/medical leave, I do suggest it. I did not. Either way, just know it does get better within a matter of weeks. "

It's like a manic insomnia, I just never WANT to go to bed. I've also used the 25 mg. dose in the daytime, when I felt extremely angry & tense. Well....it works, make no mistake about it. But gives me a heavy sedated feeling and a good bit of dizziness. Keeps my thinking calm & rational though. I understand that quetiapine is also good for opiate withdrawal. I can see why. I feel it's a good drug BUT one must buckle-up for the side effects and just suck it up. It works for the intended purpose. At 25 mg. basically it feels like an overly-strong antihistamine. I have no experience with quetiapine at higher doses,

46$Condition: Manic-Depression$10/10/2014 1:32:07 PM$Reviewer: Wendy, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been taking Seroquel for 6 months & it has been as vital as a heart pill or any other that helps you maintain a healthy life. There are side-effects, and some are not pleasant but I find that the benefits have greatly outweighed any negatives. In the beginning, I was often tired and had a hard time waking up in the morning, but that has evened out over the months. I also had an initial weight gain of 10 pounds, mostly caused by the Seroquel “munchies” as I call them. And that has also leveled off. You do need to pay closer attention to your diet on it. There is also a strange reaction where you want to move your limbs while you are resting. I found that decreasing my dose some helped with that. 
Now the positives: I have never slept better. I used to wake up multiple times during the night and had a difficult time falling to sleep. I now get at least 8 hours of the night and wake up feeling calm and relaxed. And it is a deep, restful sleep. It does not feel artificial or leave me with a medicinal hangover. Sleep has done wonders for my health. I no longer have bad headaches or muscle cramps throughout the day. I rarely have to take ibuprophen (which I used to take almost daily). No more self-medicating with alcohol or alcohol cravings.But the best and most significant difference is that I have finally found my calm! I can be happy, satisfied and content with little things. It's also made me more patient with others. I now know the meaning of peace of mind. It’s no longer me against the world looking for the enemy in everyone I meet. I feel at ease when I wake up and actually enjoy my morning coffee, watching tv, and reading without interruptions from intrusive thoughts.I no longer lash out at my husband or scream at my kids. My compulsions for self-destructive behavior have melted away kind of like a demon leaving my body. I cannot tell you what a huge relief that is. Everything is lighter without the weight of your own guilt and shame. It gave me my life back"

But no one's kidding about the side effects practically rivaling the problems for which you're taking it (which makes me wonder how the first-gens could have possibly been worse, but that's what I hear.), and withdrawing from this one's worse than usual.

The most severe problem when trying to come off this once it becomes intolerable is the unbelievable nausea that comes on within a couple days if your tapering rate is off, and is comparable to drinking way too much. It is not pleasant, to put it mildly. When I withdrew too quickly, the nausea was all-encompassing and even basic finger-movements were like short free-falls.

Don't screw around with this stuff, it punishes you hardcore if you stop taking it or taper off too quickly.

I'd recommend this for periods of mania, but not when you don't need it for that. It caused me to be listless, apathetic, and like pretty much all antipsychotics I've tried (though nowhere near to the same extent as the sadistic side effects of Zyprexa), causes what is commonly termed ""brain fog"", which makes you feel, well, drugged. In my case, it was so bad that I would not accept it. I'm still trying to taper off it, but nothing's been more unpleasant than quetiapine in this regard.

It's still vastly superior to Risperdal and definitely Zyprexa, and probably some other antipsychotics that were so disorienting I literally could not remember long periods of time while being on them. But it's the best of the worst, as it is. Take with extreme caution, and be wary of taking it for long. Its one saving grace is that it works fast and knocks out mania (along with you) almost immediately, so use it for that."

This resulted in my placement in the psychiatric ward, where the doctors switched my meds from Zoloft 200mg per day at night to Seroquil 600mg per day, 200mg in morning and 400mg at night. I understand that they did this in order to stabilize me and help me get to sleep (I was finding it difficult to go to sleep at night). Immediately I noticed a change in my mood. I no longer could feel any of my normal emotions and all I could feel were a powerful feelings of paranoia and fear. My OCD symptoms became worse. I am sure this is connected to the psychotic break. I became numb to all feelings of happiness, sadness, anger... All I could feel were loneliness, shame, and fear. Additionally, I lost the ability to dream (I would pass out promptly after taking Seroquil and wake up in the morning, having felt asleep for only about a minute). After the psych ward I was transported to a residential care facility, and over the course of 3 months I was able to reduce my dosage from 600mg to only 100mg in the evening. Through tapering off Seroquil, I have been able to feel almost my full range of emotions again and I have felt comfortable expressing them. Peers and doctors were able to notice a marked difference in my mood, demeanor, sleep patterns, interaction with others, self-esteem, etc. The last change in my dosage (from 200mg to 100mg) was almost 8 months ago, and the new psychiatrist I have been seeing (not the psychiatrist from the residential care unit) has been resistant to the possibility of tapering off my Seroquil completely. I am looking forward to working with a future psychiatrist and future therapist in order to slowly wean myself off Seroquil completely. This is because I want to switch to naturopathic medicine and therapy to help with my depression and insomnia.

My doctor started me on Seroquel 300 mg along with 2 other meds (Wellbutrin and Trileptal) to treat all of the symptoms for this disorder.  I became stable in about a year and a helf.  And so for the last 8 years I have been able to sleep and function and hold down a good job.  Then they came out with the generic.  I have been on it for approximately 3 months.  It's not working.  I have not been able to fall asleep as I previously did.  I have now resorted to taking 1 1/2 to 2 Xs the dosage just so I can sleep.  Sometimes I lay in bed for 2 to 2 1/2 hours waiting for sleep.  Now my stability has been compromised because I have been forced to take the generic equivolent as I can no longer afford the brand name.  Working at getting this corrected, but beware of the generic form of Seroquel (quetiapine fumarate)!  It is not as efficacious as the real thing.

So far i only deal with thirst and a slight increase in appatite. When i first started taking it i dealt with a drug hangover but it has gotten better over time. It helps with sleep and dreams and some aggitation but i still battle with Bipolar 1 Disorder. For the most part i would reccomend it to others. It is a good drug.

My doctor put me on 800 mg a day right away. I was a zombie..I had no feelings whatsoever. Worst experience of my life. I couldn't function. It would knock me out within 5 mins of taking it, and then I couldn't get up in the morning. It affected my work more than it did not being on meds.

124$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$8/31/2008 6:18:39 AM$Reviewer: bwp, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$Started taking 100mg at night for bipolar and lack of sleep.  Turns out, i slept horribly, crazy dreams when i did.  If i did not get around 9 hours of sleep, i would be worthless the following day (tired, agitated, zombie like).  Also, it made me feel like i had a stomack flu and threw up about 3 out of the 4 days i was on it.  My opinion, if you have bipolar, take drugs that are strickly for biploar, do not take meds that are for one sickness and happen to help another (for reasons that the Dr.'s don't even know how they work)!  I am very upset about the lack of information i was given from my Doctor.  Also she gave me no mention of the extreme weight gain associated with this drug.  Sorry for the ramble but i was not pleased with the side effects of this drug.

138$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/11/2008 11:41:57 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Previously I had been treated with very limited success with: Lithium, Depacote, Triliptal, Risperdal, Lamictal, zoloft, Wellbutrin, Abilify, clonsepam, zypreza etc.  My exsistance was unbearable.  I went to a clinic and was taken off all the above.  I spent three weeks rapid cycling with psychotic features and devestating depressions and suicidality.  Within a week of starting Seroquel  my symptoms disappeared and have not returned in two years.  The possible side effects are frightening but nothing compares with the hell I lived with for nearly 20 years

The weight gain has been hard for my family and I, but is not a major problem.  So far my blood sugar levels have beeb stable which is also a concern for some.

This med has allowed me to function in both my workplace and personal life. I no longer have delusions or hear voices. This med does take a few weeks to start working. It is far better than my previous main meds over the last 20 years which included Depakote and Lithium. I would recommend this med to anyone who has had mixed results with other meds.
