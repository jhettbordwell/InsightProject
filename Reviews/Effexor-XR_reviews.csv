Without that drug, I would have never known.

I just stopped having any emotions except  anger.  I developed  eosinophil reaction on arms and esophagus after 21 years on med.  Tried 3 times to taper off.  Last try I  used prozac to help taper and after 3 months am off completely.  Never again.  I'm  off of it now 60 days.  Still have brain zaps and headaches.

And this lasted for a week Iâ??m just so scared that the side effects are actually worse because , i had to call in sick at my job ... i donâ??t even want to know how Iâ??m going to get off of this because I donâ??t wan to be in meds for years ..

Extremely difficult to come off of due to side effects both times. Presently going through this now. Took last dose over a week ago and continue to have dizziness and head spinning. Very scary! Iâ??m also a nurse.

Went through a research project for Effexor XR and found it to help me more than anything else ever had and it took me half my life to find it.  I feel human with this med.  I have taken it for at least 20 years
7$Condition: Depression$8/1/2018 2:12:01 PM$Reviewer: Jess, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$2$5$When I started high school I had major anxiety and depression. I think this drug kept me alive during that difficult time in my life but it came with terrible side effects. I canâ??t remember a lot when I look back on those four years. My thoughts were kind of hazy and my body always felt weak and heavy. When I was finally ready to come off it it took me two and a half years to come off it completely. I experienced terrible withdrawals: tremors, weakness, mood swings, a weird electric shock feeling throughout my body, dizziness, exhaustion, fever, high heart rate. I am so glad that whole experience is over. I am greatfull that Effexor got me through it but if I could go back I would have tried other things first and maybe just turn to this as a last  resort.
8$Condition: Depression$6/12/2018 9:34:44 AM$Reviewer: Cindy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have bee on this drug for 15 years plus. It saved my sanity and probably my life. You need to take it around the same time each day. For me it levels my moods but sometimes I worry that maybe it just too level with no high or low just level. But it is my life changer to get me out of the severe depression! Thank you Effexor! I tried many others and they did not work for me. Effexor was the one that brought my life back to normal! I will probably be on it the rest of my life Iâ??m on 150 mg a day and have held steady the last 10 years! It works well for me! 
9$Condition: Depression$4/26/2018 9:00:32 PM$Reviewer: Adrienne, 19-24 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$I loved this medication. I was diagnosed with depression at around 10yrs old. I saw a pediatric psychiatrist for a few yrs and after trying multiple meds stayed on Effexor. I took a higher dose of 300mg but was on it for almost 15yrs before it quit working for me. My only complaint in the many years of using it was that if I forgot my pills 2 days in a row I was super physically ill. It made me outragously nauseous if I missed it more than 2 days in a row. If I missed it one day I was ok. Effexor worked amazingly for me and I'm super upset it no longer works but it was a life changer for me.

Tried lots of other anti-depressants and mood-stabilizers before which didn't work. Also took it a while in combo with lithium and diazepam (which made me a complete zombie). Overall it does make getting out of bed in the morning easier. Has been especially helpful with my crippling anxiety. Stopping it is terrible though. Major withdrawal symptoms even if I'm only a few hours late taking it.

Instead of making me feel better, there were days I could barely function due to the fatigue and sleepiness, not to mention the headaches. The dreams were really weird.

28$Condition: Depression$5/10/2016 5:18:30 AM$Reviewer: yaayforme, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$3$5$When I started on this medication I felt like it was really good. My depression decreased significantly but I feel it did kind of numb me like #when you feel like crying but your antidepressants won't let you, yeah. If you do not have insurance this medication can be very expensive. So if you don't have insurance or can't keep up on refills I wouldn't recommend it because once you start you literally can not stop. If I forget to take my meds I get so sick I have to take it or if I run low and/or don't refill on time I am in the ER because I can't function. I get severe brain zaps, very dizzy, hot and nauseous. Besides depression I have borderline personality disorder and I feel this has really help with my impulsiveness and mood swings. I have been at my job the longest I have ever in my life, I have achieved goals I never would have otherwise and it has kind of helped with my alcoholism. My sex drive is really low now, which is kind of good because its helped with my impulsiveness lol. TMI I know but overall I think it is good if the side effects weren't so bad.
29$Condition: Depression$4/12/2016 9:20:47 AM$Reviewer: datura27, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$1$1$DO NOT LET YOUR DOCTOR PUT YOU ON THIS! It is extremely difficult to get off of. I was on 150mg/daily and if I did not take it within 2 hours of waking I would get very dizzy. I became concerned about being on it so I weaned myself off (depression managed well over a year later now) and the ONLY way to do it is to literally count out the little beads and take just a few less every couple of days. Weaning off means headaches, whooshing sounds in ears, dizziness, insomnia. It's very hard to do! Try something else first!!!

Hit and killed a pedestrian and couldnt get over it. Had depression prior but had been able to survive without meds. Doc kept upping my dose. pretty soon was just wound up and put me on xanax which made me sleep. I drive a lot so that wasnt good. Lowered the dose and got off. depression returned in a month. Went back on. Kept playing with the dosage and then it quit working completely. So five years after first being on it i was swithced to effexor. Too high a dose at first. but only took a few months to adjust it so i do a 50mg pill in the morning and one at night. finally im doing good. killed my sex drive but it beats killing myself.

I love that if I forget to take it that it makes me feel odd enough to realize I need to go take it but I can function if I can't get to it right away. I take it as soon as I can to relieve the fussy feeling and it does go away within the hour usually after taking it. I am like the old me, a social bug.

dosage.  No side effects at all.  Was very sad but noticed after about a month that things did not bother me as much.  It was very gradual.  Helped a lot.  No need to try to get off.  Why would anyone try to stop taking a medically necessary prescription?  If your brain has ceased making the necessary amount of serotonin to keep you stable, it is never going to get better.  You need to STAY on your meds.  People have caused their own problems by trying to stop taking meds on their own. Their doctors would have told them that if they had the sense to ask.  "

I could not think right from wrong. I mentally hurt people. I was down right mean. Last I committed a crime not caring. I did not care about ANYTHING! I have gone back up to 75mg.I now feel so much better. The problem is I feel I will always be stuck on these pills.

My dosage went up to 300MG.  At one time ten years ago I tried getting off of the drug due to thoughts it was not working with the help of my Dr.  I was introduced to another drug while getting off of Effexor..  Let me tell you that I could only reach down to 150Mg..  I had to stop, My symptoms of depression got so bad that i thought I was going out of my mind with every side effect possible..
I stopt at 150mg with the help of another medication that was substituted.  
I stayed like that until present when my doctor wanted to take me off of the effexor completely..
he told me he would help me..
well let me tell you it has been hell for me. I have feelings worst the the depression I had upon first starting the Effexor..  I have been completely off of the effexor for 3 months now and considering all my new health problems due to the effexor I refuse to get back on it...
I have become a type 3 diabetec, very high blood pressure getting uncontrolable and cholesteral that I do not want to talk about. The nauseous  and headaches I can go on and on.

 PLEASE I RECOMMEND TO GET OFF OF IT, IT IS A LIFE THREATNING  MEDICATION THAT SH0ULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET

My psychiatrist had me worked up to 225mg which I was told was the highest recommended dosage, and not too much longer after told me to take two pills, two times a day. This drug has ruined my life and turned me into a drug addict junkie and an awful person. This drug caused me to ruin many relationships in my life, caused multiple over doses and the biggest wake up call of my life. An overdose that put me into a coma for a week and the realization that years of my life were erased by the time I decided to become sober in 2013. It is now August 2015 and I am still obsessed with this drug. I have constant relapse dreams and vivid memories of how this drug made me feel that are destroying me, even though I have not taken this drug in almost 3 years. I still look for ways to get ahold of Effexor and how to get prescriptions. Do not sell your soul to this drug.
40$Condition: Depression$7/15/2015 4:09:40 AM$Reviewer: PunkJesster, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$4$I was the first patient at the age of 18 in my doctor's clinic to take this pill in 2000. It was ineffective for me until put on a ridiculously high dosage. When I reached this high dosage, I lost track of time, what day it was, where I was, I would pass out constantly wherever I was sitting, I couldn't react to emotions or feel emotional in the slightest (for ex. my friend committed suicide while I was on Effexor XR I could not cry - I felt completely and utterly numb). When I was being taken off this product I had severe withdrawl symptoms: seizing/spasming of my entire body, feelings of zapping/electrocution in the head, sounds of electric buzzing/zapping, nausea, headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, vomiting, periods of unconsciousness - I was bedridden for 5 days. Long-term side effects: uncontrollable twitches. I would never recommend this medication to anyone.

Getting off of it is horrible. I have been taking it about 2 years,first for hot flashes caused by cancer preventing medicine, then I stayed on it because it helped me with my job stress. I have been trying to get off of it for about 3 months. I can go 2 days between pills but when it gets to 3 days I get horrible nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue so bad I have to drag myself out of bed. I literally thought I was dying until I figured out that it was going without the drug that was causing the problems. I will definitely be sharing my experiences with my oncologist who prescribed it at my next check up.

I dealt with nausea and dizziness like none other.  When the medication stopped working for me, I stayed on it just because the side-effects of going off of it were too bad. I knew I'd have to take a week off work to wean myself off.  And when I did eventually get the time, I did need about a week to fully recover from going off the medication.  I've been on Zoloft, Seroquel, Effexor, Fetzima, and Prozac and none of these other medications had the awful side effects that Effexor did.  My major problem was just the side-effects.

I've had depression, PTSD, anxiety, and never wanted to take pills for it, but after a major upsetting event in my life, I pretty much had no choice and was forced into it by loved ones. Crappy time emotionally. But, I was SURPRISED by the results. It works. It doesn't make my life 100% amazing or even 75% and all problems go away instantly in any means, I get really sad still, but I can function. For anyone struggling to see improvement when taking anti-depressants, please don't give up. After my first drug didn't work, I was so done with it all but agreed to try ONE more time for something and it's working. There are so many anti-depressants out there...don't give up hope.

It really did seem to help at first. I was a lot calmer and less iritated.  i've also tried Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro,and Abilify(it worked but gained 40lbs-do not suggest).  The problem with this drug is it seems to put you into your own world and for me it made me less interested in going out into the world and having experiences with others. It also did have a decreased sexual effect on me.  I was still able to achieve orgasm, just was really not interested with having sex anymore-where as before i was really interested in it.  Now the icing on the cake-getting off of this drug-IMPOSSIBLE. I could tell if i was even a couple hours late in taking it because i would experience numbness in my face-extreme vertigo to the point of vomiting, cold sweats, horrible! i am tapering off of it now to try a new drug, Britellex.  If this doesn't work-i am just going to deal with depression!

I am thankful for the support of my MD and his second referral and grateful for the support and knowledge of my current APNP.

The only way I can describe the side effects of this drug is like getting food poisoning, the flu and a migraine combined with taking a sleeping pill.. thats what it feels like within an hour of taking one 75mg capsule. 

I was dry heaving, had diarrhea and cramps for 2 days, headaches and major drowsiness. I felt like I was hung over from a week in Vegas.

The side effects were far worse then having depression. "
57$Condition: Depression$8/2/2014 3:53:42 AM$Reviewer: SirGrumpy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$4$"I got brainwashed into a 1 year effexor treatment and it worked like a charm. 7 years of depression and anxiety simply vanished on the first pill. So did my interest in sex, erections, empathy and emotional depth, which were supposed to re-emerge after treatment so I didn't complain about it at the time. I also had an uncharacteristically positive disposition on the matter (high on serotonin) and I was afraid of going back to depression so I even passed down on the possibility of switching meds. When I consulted with the doc regarding going off the drug at the 1 year marker, he actually suggested prolonging treatment by another year since ""effexor is harmless"". I refused because the unexistent libido and cold erections were not something i was willing to endure for more than a year and i felt perfectly fine mood-wise. So, the doc told me to taper, I went cold turkey and through the typical withdrawal of hellish nightmares, dizzyness, brain zaps, irritability and inability to think for a week. One and a half year off the meds i got the empathy back... From my new psychiatrist that is, who keeps hearing about how my libido, erections and interest in activities are still far from normal and how his 3 colleagues which i previously tried to consult on the matter tried to force-convince me, first visit, that it's just me or i'm still depressed and effexor had nothing to do with it. He was sceptic at first and then stumbled upon some research which backed me up on the sexual stuff. He assumes that it's not permanent and has no idea on what to do to help, other than offer me some drug treatment(...), bear with my obsessive monologues of rage and regret and suggest alternative methods like acupuncture, which i haven't yet gotten around to trying due to procrastinating over the agonizing uncertainty. Mending a busted leg at the expense of an arm is hardly my idea of healing and a lifetime of unreasonable medication is simply unacceptable to me, so effexor and the like...NO!"

Warning... The withdrawal symptoms are AWFUL and SCAREY! I was released as a patient by my family doctor after he had complications with my mother and she passed. Due to the doctor change my scripts needed an authorized refill. Well, getting a new doctor takes longer then 30 days, so I had no choice but to stop my meds.

Yes the withdrawn symptoms, yes very difficult to get off the drug BUT you MUST tamper very very slowly. 
I learnt this and I am on and off this drug say once a year and/or when I want, here what I do...

From a health shop I buy some hawthorn herbs capsule (*I need the capsule to be empty*, so I put the hawthorn powder on my cereals –it is good for you, but sue that is not the topic)

Then if I started with 37.5, I open the capsule and divide the content in two>
Take for 5 days
Then>take 2 capsules 37.5 and divide the content in 3 capsule >take for 5/7days

Then you are at 37.5 (one original capsule) > take for at least 10 day (if you need to increase the dosage ...same fashion described, .. 
one 75 capsule, split in two and so on. 

AND TAKE NOTE WRITE ALL DOWN, TIME AND DOSAGE. If you use Effexor XR this way + cognitive therapy = The nightmare is over...live is fabulous again-;) (Well this is my experience anyway)

If you do not do this, yes all that bad stuff happens.
***Felling over optimist and a bit ...to happy. Write down a few notes and read them every morning, i.e. I am so confident because of the drug, don’t go overboard.

This is a great fabulous drug for anxiety/rage and depression.

PS: I have being in other antidepressants >same story.... get a pill cutter in the pharmacy.

Bottom line tampering may take you 3-4 months if you are taking it for 6-7 months, if you are taking for  1-2-3 years, you may need a year to go off WITH NO SIDE EFFECT....TAMPER THE INCREASE-DECREADE DOSE SLOWLY. (Quitting cold turkey...means pure madness do NOT do that).

PS. Tranquilizers ...CAREFUL the addiction is greater than the antidepressant

There were times when I felt I no longer needed it and when I stopped taking it (weaning myself down to smaller and smaller does) and went through some harsh withdrawal symptoms. I always ended up going back on it because my symptoms returned. Life for me is much nicer because of the Effexor XR.

I have suffered no side affects, have occassionally had to take Abilify when mood swings became unbearable, but otherwise my life is good.

Effexor was my last attempt at antidepressants. I've been on a relatively low dose of 75 mg. Used it for approximately one year. Like the other meds, Effexor did next to nothing to improve my depression or alleviate anxiety, except causing me to cry less (instead feelings are bottled up inside) and diminishing my libido. The main difference between Effexor and the other brands is much worse withdrawal symptoms. I've been following my doctor's instructions for weaning off the medicine for three weeks, still I experience debilitating dizziness and what feels like small electric shocks to the brain. Constantly. A truly horrible drug. Can't wait to get it out of my system. 
86$Condition: Depression$1/7/2014 9:06:34 PM$Reviewer: amyd, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"Effectiveness of Effexor XR (150 mg daily) for depression:  sadness and crying over nothing was practically eliminated;  enjoyed being with people again;  stopped worrying that something bad was going to happen;  easier to deal with life's difficulties.  Overall I think it was easier for others to be around me and a good drug of choice for the time.

Undesirable side effects:  still had libido, but reduced orgasms to zilch...main reason for going off this drug.  Realistic nightmares the first year or so which diminished over time.  Extreme yawning and felt groggy always.  Dry mouth (which I think is a side effect of most anti-depressants).  A missed dosage (which seldom happened) would make me feel very light-headed and woozy.  Be sure to follow your Doctor's recommendations for changes in dosage (increase or decrease).

Was off Effexor XR for about 9 months. Sex life improved 500%.  Energy level improved and gave me motivation to exercise and lose about 20 lbs.  Other than that, everything irritates me and I am not easy to be around (type A perfectionist that I am).  Back to my MD today.  Am going to try Lexapro."

After getting on the correct dosage, which ended up being 225mg for me, I felt like my old self again. It's not a ""happy pill"" but simply allows me to feel the emotions of everyday life. I laugh like I used to before my depression, and yet can feel sad and cry at times when it would be typical to feel that way. Before this medication, I was just crying all the time - for no apparent reason. Other meds have caused me to feel NO emotions at all. Yes, the weight gain of about 15 pounds was frustrating but I could also do more to lose it. I do sweat more as well. I have only missed one dose and there were very minimal side effects which I was expecting - headache, some tingling when I moved my head suddenly.  When I told my doctor these side effects, he asked me if it was worth taking.......ABSOLUTELY. I know it isn't for everyone but for me - I'm just fine with it. I have my life back again."

If you forget a daily dose the withdrawals are terrible. A medication prescribed to patients dealing with bipolar disorder who sometimes have trouble remembering should never have built in, sickening withdrawals if you miss one daily dose. If you take this pill, you'll be at risk of heatstroke on 80 degree days if you're in the sun too long. You'll have high blood pressure that you didn't have before, too. I'm a recovering cocaine and crack addict (7 years clean) and the withdrawals from Effexor XR make coke/crack withdrawals seem like a case of the sniffles. Unlike street drugs, the longer you go without Effexor XR in your system, the more the withdrawals make you think you're dying. The makers of this drug and those who prescribe it are evil people only concerned with their financial bottom line and keeping patients unwillingly hooked on their product.

I had experienced the negatives 4 hours after my regular scheduled dose... headache would become a migraine with sweating and soon I would be vomiting. so I decided to ween off the pills slowly.

Prozac stopped working after about 6 months. Zoloft made me act and feel like a zombie. Wellbutrin made me suicidal (even more than I was. I also tried the Effexor immediate release tablets but it made me sick to my stomach and I couldn't tolerate it anymore. I was on it for 6 weeks and the side effects never went away, so I had to stop taking it.

I was on it for about six years and worked great for me during that time, along with 12.5mg of Paxil CR.  I weaned myself off of the Paxil, no problem.  Went to the MD to do something about the Effexor because all in all, I don't believe there are enough studies out to show if it is safe  to take while pregnant and the MDs I have talked to seemed to think this as well.  I am on day three of being off Effexor.  Not fun!  Luckily, I had some planned days off of work (I work as a nurse) and am glad I'm doing this away from work.  From what I have been reading, the side effects will go on for another week or two.  I feel nauseated, ill, just do not feel good in general.  I'm on 20mg of Prozac now, which has been proven to be safe to take while pregnant.  Just want to get this Effexor withdrawal done, so over feeling ill.  People on here call them ""brain zaps"", which is what it feels like in your head, withdrawing from this drug.  I just can't wait to be done with it.  I had a crying spell this morning, luckily have an understanding husband who helped me through it.

I am sick of meds. I didn't think too much of it because I
did the same with a mood stabilizer last fall-cold turkey.
I've never been suicidal but main stream depression seems to a classic part of my personality. To have on-going chronic pain for years wears a person down. Loosing family members to cancer over & over doesn't help, either. So, off I go to a doctor about 8 yrs ago, per husbands suggestion. Fast forward to today. I stopped the Effexor-300 mg & now I'm not sure what to do. Go back on it? I won't call my doctor. What I really want is to get off it plus Zopiden & Xanax. I need my thyroid med, of course. I haven't smoked or had a drink in over 14 yrs. Trying to do the right thing has now become a nightmare. Sleep-aid? ADDICTED. Plus, I take 200 mg over the counter sleep aid along with the Zopiden each nite. And, I pray. I would joke, even as a teen 50 yrs ago that my glass was always 1/2 empty. Nothing's changed. I now have flu-like symptoms. Sad part-even while on the meds, this last yr I've stayed in bed about 75% of the time.
I'm not high energy, never was. Don't let people tell you to
JUST GET UP. My extended family thinks I'm lazy. Now I'm facing 2 more surgeries. I learned the hard way to keep my mouth shut, pretend all is well so not to drag family down. This is not a pity party. This is my life. Are there others that can understand me?"

I have been on this drug for several years and it has been very effective.  However, if I have been late in taking or have missed a dose, I get extremely ill-terrible headaches, extreme crying, nausea, the works.  This has been my biggest complaint with this drug.  A year ago, I tried weening off of it to try another, but I could not do it.  My last doctor visit, my doctor said Pristiq was a great alternative and was just as good.  I started it the day after.  Now I am throwing up and can not keep anything down.  I have a horrible headache and I cannot stop crying-and I am at work! No more sick days.

Now, I will be trying a week of overlapping the two.  We shall see how this goes....I will say that I was in a very deep depression and compared to 3 years ago, I am doing very well.  However, I do have my days, weeks when I still do not get out of bed on weekends.  But Effexor has been very helpful.

I was so depressed that I was crying all the time.  Effexor helped immediately with very little side effect.  However, if I missed a dose, I became extremely ill.  The worst side effect was brain zaps, like little electric shocks.  I decided to stop taking Effexor because of the side effects and it was hell to stop.  I started at 150 mg per day, weaning down to 35 mg per day.  I truly worried for my mental state as I detoxed this drug.  I have never been suicidal, but did feel hopeless and overwhelming sadness.  I had two panic attacks and raged/cried nonstop for several weeks.  I took double doses of Omega3 which really helped with the brain zaps. I have been off the Effexor for a little over a month now and feel that it is mostly out of my system.  I think this is a dangerous drug and should not be taken without full knowledge of the side effects, particularly when decreasing the dose.  I have been telling everyone I know to stay away from this medication.  I now understand why people can become suicidal from antidepressants.

My doctor started me off on a program to ease into it by slowly cutting down my dose of Cymbalta and increasing my dose of Effexor. I ended up on 150mg, but the week after that had terrible headaches. The doctor increased my dose to 300mg.
For the next 4 months, I experienced terrible, migraine-like headaches, and quite frequent hot spells (I'm only 36, not going through menopause yet). The headaches lasted for days at a time, and forced me to use up my sick days from work because of it.
I have Asperger's - an Autism Spectrum Disorder. I found out in the middle of December that Effexor is *contraindicated* for anyone with ASD. So I came off Effexor (entirely) and went back on Cymbalta. During the first week after that, I had two of what I called ""Effexor headaches"", but they lasted only the one day, up until I fell asleep at night. There have been no other withdrawal side-effects for me; I suspect that the Cymbalta has been cushioning them."

The Effexor has really done a number on me. I feel more depressed because I have to take it than I do about my crazy life circumstances. I have had suicidal thoughts regularly while on the full dosage. I decided about 2 months ago to taper off my dosage starting with a 10mg reduction each day (opening the capsule and removing the granules which when counted are right at 150 total). By the 5th day, or 120mg I was a basket case. I decided to Try a different approach. I would remove 5mg making my 7 day intake 145mg. I would then do another week at 140mg, then the next week at 135mg and so on. This has worked. UNTIL last night. I had the single most Terrifying night in my almost 45 years of living. For starters, I take Ambien because I can’t sleep. It didn’t help at all last night. I landed in some weird state of mental being about an hour after laying down. I could not move. My eyes were closed and It took all I could do to open one eye, my right one. I was super-hyper aware of everything surrounding me, My 8yr old on one side, my wife on the other, their breathing, my heartbeat, the dripping faucet, the sleepless stepchild in the other room. It was as if I could hear the air move. I found myself plunged into sheer terror. It was as if everything I have ever read was presenting itself all at once in a barrage of information overload with letter and numbers mixed in no intelligible arrangement. I felt as though I was being immersed in this swirling craziness as if attached to a slingshot being thrust into the mayhem and jerked back out again. I was awake but had no control of anything, my thoughts or body. I could not form words to speak. I could see through my closed eyelids as though I had night-vision goggles on. A heaviness beyond description had settled on me. It passed around 3am. I was looking at the ceiling until 5:30. . I am struggling with the thoughts of this medicine and its death grip on me.

My fingers swelled so much that I couln't wear my wedding rings.  My knees, feet, elbows, hands and fingers hurt so bad that I actually got tested for RA and a bunch of other serious illnesses.  I coulld hardly walk and was crying every night.  I asked several doctors if the terrible pain and swelling I was experiencing could be from the effexor and they all said no.  When all of my bloodwork came back fine I stopped taking it and within 3 days I finally feel like myself again.  I just want everyone out there to know that if they are experiencing terrible joint pain and swelling it could definitely be from effexor xr.

Advice for those who want to stop: Try following suggestions of the website ""The Road Back,"" a nonprofit organization that specializes in getting people off this type of medication. Omega 3 complex (fish oil) mellows brain zaps for me and for the first time I have been able to reduce the dosage. Down to to 37.5 after taking 150 for nearly 9 years. Will quit for good in a week.

I had a terrible time with the drugs I tried, namely Zoloft and Paxil. I had some success with Wellbutrin, until I started having terrible panic attacks and depersonalization. I swore never to use any medications ever again to treat depression, until I entered a treatment facility and my doctor insisted I try Effexor. 

I am so glad I did. Effexor has been a miracle drug for me. I never thought I would find a drug that was so helpful. In the first few weeks I did experience some nausea and other small side effects, but then I just felt...better. I felt happier and more comfortable. After a few months of taking it, I even noticed that my anxiety and panic attacks had become almost non-existent, something I never thought possible. I still get depressed from time to time, but it is far more manageable and not overwhelming. 

I have noticed that even when I miss just a few doses (like when I forget to refill a prescription for a few days) I do get pretty horrible withdrawal symptoms. Obviously I'm not looking forward to going off this drug for good. 

But for now, I'm feeling great. For anyone out there struggling to find the right drug, don't give up! I thought all anti-depressants were evil until I found the right one for me. I now believe that since all our brains are different, everyone just needs to find the drug that works best for their brain."

I had tried so many other meds for depression with good results, but become resistent after taking them a good amount of time. Dr ""didn't know"" what else to give me. I had a friend who was in fulll blown Major Depression and was prescribed Effexor and after 2 weeks she was a different person; in control of her emotions, depression, a complete 360 degrees of how she was. So I told my dr this story and he put me on Effexor 150 mg 1X per day.  This seemed to work wonderful after days of getting into my system. About a yr after taking it, I noticed my depression getting worse. Dosage was upped to 300 mg. 1X in am and have been doing well on this. Still have bouts of depression, but these are situational. I did not  have any side effects that I noticed, but am not one to ever really get side effects from meds. All in all, I feel that Effexor XR is a great anti-depressant compared to some of the others I've been on; Prozac (stopped working when I was forced to got from name brand to generic fluoxetine and bombed out, lost job) trazodone which I took over 10 years ago for depression which did not work and now prescribed for sleep (loses effectiveness after years of taking), Lexapro which was like candy and did nothing, and a couple others, I can't even remember their names.  Effexor works. If you get side effects, give them a few days to work themselves out, don't give up on Effexor.  It changed my life to one I can tolerate at least 85% better than before!  My friend was able to go off Effex as her depression was situational and when she changed her situation, she was able to go off Effex, by tapering it down.  NEVER STOP A MED COLD TURKEY>of course you'll get side effects of stopping it all at one time!  Let doctors taper you on and off meds, do not think you can do it yourself!

182$Condition: Depression$10/8/2012 4:02:10 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I've dealt with depression since around 12 years of age.  I was told I may have a chemical imbalance at age 16.  At 19, I tried Prozac but didn't stay on it.  Then I tried Lexapro, Paxil CR, Cymbalta, all prescribed by family doctor.  I eventually had a breakdown at age 23 after being off Cymbalta for 6 months and had a psychiatrist start me on Effexor 150mg. It changed my life.  My relationships with others improved, I became an RN, bought my first house and married my love.  I will be 30 soon.  I started Paxil 12.5mg a year after starting the Effexor because depression was still getting me and the combination of the two has worked great for me.  I worry about getting pregnant while on these drugs.  I have discussed this with my family MD and psychiatrist both and both say they should be fine for me to take while pregnant.  The biggest complaints I have about these two meds is sweating at night when sleeping, low sexual desire and possible slow weight gain over the years (but that can't be proved to be the drugs).  DO NOT stop antidepressants on your own or taper off of them on your own. Take Effexor at the same time every day.  Just a few hours of being late with my med causes extreme irritability, dizziness, panic and if waiting too long, sobbing uncontrollably thinking you will die, even though you know it was the med withdrawal.  And it takes a few hours for it to kick back in.  I advise to see a psychiatrist for mental illness, not just your family MD.  Except for a few side effects that I've decided I can live with, this drug changed my life and helped me accomplish my life goals.  I think more clearly, can handle stress and don't worry unnecessarily.  I am not emotionless and live a happy and healthy life.  The next step is figuring out if Paxil and Effexor are safe to take while pregnant.  So far, I think I may taper off the Paxil before becoming pregnant but stay on the Effexor.  Not sure but will discuss with my doctors and post how I deal in the future.

My worst long term side effect is memory loss/ short term. I forget if I have taken it or not. Either way, those effects are horrendous. I have been experiencing double vision, pain in my bones and headaches. I do have other changing effects, but those are my most severe. I have decided to take a different approach. I already exercise regularly.I am changing my entire diet. Gluten free (wheat, barley, malts etc.) and Casein free (dairy), have worked tremendously for our son with asperger syndrome.

I have already experienced the brain zaps and hallucinations and so forth from missing meds. I know what I am in for and not looking forward to it. I have no choice. Hopefully this diet will help brain function. I'd rather have crappy food, than have my body fall apart and hurt. Good luck to everyone, I hope you all feel better soon.

I guess if it's not working for you, you should stop taking it (under close medical supervision), but several of the reviewers admit it helps them, then talk about the withdrawl symptoms..  Not real sure why you stop taking a drug that works for you?  Depression is not like an infection -- you aren't ""cured"" by taking a few doses.  If you had high blood pressure, you wouldn't stop taking blood pressure medicine just because it came down while you were on it, would you?  
I have been on this for years and it works for me. I would be a basket case without it.  I was fat to start with, so I guess I didn't notice if I gained weight after I started it. I just know I am a much better person inside my head with it than without it. "

I guess the medicine works for some people but I'm not one of them.

This med (effexor) worked great for me. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for 20 yrs and this did the trick. The only problem I have with effexor is that I found out I was pregnant when I went in for surgery and had to stop effexor cold turkey! Not good, do not recomend cold turkey unless dr advises. Withdrawl is pure evil! I have been off effexor for 4 days and still feel almost numb and tingley all over! I feel light headed and dizzy, I feel like my balance is off and only doing it for the wellbeing of my unborn baby! after I give birth I will definately go back on effexor and hope I never have to stop again!!

I did not feel it was doing any good whatsoever so when  finished with the Tamoxifen, I asked my doctor to switch me back to the other meds. Even with tapering off, smaller doses etc etc, the side effects and WITHDRAWAL symtoms are beyond belief.  What is in this stuff that makes it so addicting? I still am having the horrible withdrawal symptoms and it's been over a month of cutting down.  NO ONE should ever have to go through withdrawal like this ... if it had been an illegal drug then I could justify it, but a drug that is supposed to help depression - ridiculous.  In my opinion this drug should be taken off the market immediately.

You can do a long taper of weeks, months and in some cases years and you will still have horrible side effects.  A year on, and after having to go on another antidepressant because the side effects of withdrawal were so horrible, I am still not feeling right and one of the worst side effects is memory loss.  Do no take this drug.  The Glaxo Smith Kline July 2012 billion dollar settlement is the tip of the iceberg.  That settlement had to do with prescribing for teenagers and off-label uses (lies) - just wait, there will be more if people on the inside continue to whistle-blow.  Meanwhile, there is nothing to help those whose lives have been ruined by this crap. It is as difficult to get off of as heroin but I am not so sure it isn't worse.  No one really knows how or why it ""works"" - but it works by somehow deadening your feelings. You don't give a damn about anything.  If you ever want to go off of it, plan on tapering and then going crazy anway. "

Weight gain and lack of sex drive seems to be the side effects of all of these SSRI's. It has helped a lot with my major depression. The past 6 months or so, it feel like it has stopped working. Maybe I have been on it too long. I do, however, wonder how any other SSRI will work better since they all basically work the same way. I'll check with my GP and possibly try something else.

212$Condition: Depression$5/24/2012 12:43:19 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  (Patient) $2$1$4$I was prescribed Effexor xr by me PCP. I had some improvement but it didn't seem to change much of my symptoms. I finally got in to see a Psychiatrist and he changed my medication, adjusting to lower the Effexor and increasing the new medication. The first reduction from 225mg down to 150mg caused me horrible mental distress and many other problems. The worst was extreme rage which I had to be prescribed another medication for it because I could not control my anger and could not tolerate any kind of emotions I had. Until my Psychiatrist talked to me and I understood it was the medication, I knew I was in for a hard time. It's been 3 months backing off and I'm just now at 75mg this week and have another 6 weeks to go before I can try staying off the Effexor. I think this medication can be helpful for a lot of permanent problems, but I think it's a catch all pill the PCPs prescribe because it's supposed to cover so many problems. I would recommend going to a Psychiatrist to be diagnosed and get on the proper medication the first time. I'll never let a regular doctor diagnose my mental state again. I could have easily not continued my life because I couldn't handle the withdrawals until the Psych DR. put me on the medication to keep the rage under control. Most people I talk to that have taken this medicine have gotten off it because the unbearable problems it causes.

it helps with the depression, sure, but it stuffs around with the function of your brain - the most complex organism in the known universe - with drugs that have only been around since what, the 70's?  
I have been on and off effexor since 2004 and it has made what would have been simply a 'rough patch' (which is just part of life) drag on until this day and still dragging because now i am addicted.  It has messed up my perception of what is 'normal' for me.  It has made me sedate and subdued and satisfied with not achieving really anything much since then because i have been sort of 'comfortably numb'.  It has stopped me from resolving the original cause of my problems by putting a blanket over them so it's all still there, you just can't feel it until you stop taking the damn stuff.  It has made my personality so flat and dull that i might aswell be depressed. 

IT HAS MADE MY EYES BLURRY AND MY DICK NOT WORK.  

Sure, it helped the depression, but so would lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and drinking, exercising, healthy diet, nutrient supplements and some good councelling.  But i was young, and the doctor's said that i was sick, and you just assume that they know what they're talking about. WELL DON'T!!! Read up on it yourself first!!!  Look into alternatives like relaxation techniques, healthy eating, exercise, see a naturopath, meditate, quit smoking and drinking if you do, make some positive changes in your life, find a good psychologist to talk to, THESE THINGS ARE A LAST RESORT IF-ALL-ELSE-FAILS OPTION!!!  So many GP's and psychiatrists will listen to your symptoms and just start dolling out the drugs! Anti-depressants and benzodiazapines and anti-psychotics are only needed in cases of serious mental illness. Im not mentally ill but i ended up hospitalized when i tried to come off too quickly!

When I tried Effexor, I had finally decided to consult with a psych. I had a similar reaction to all of these drugs, but my one time 18 mg. dose of Effexor was the worst; my body got the warm, tingly sensation, loss of coordination, hard to concentrate, hard to swallow, extreme head ache, body shakes, vomiting, no sleep for 2 days. I only took it one day, and three days later, my head is still pounding. Where as my internist had suggested that I stick with these symptoms for a week in hope they would get better, my psych wanted me to stop and head to the ER right away. Come to find out, not all people can matabolise the SSRI/SNRI drugs. I suggest listen to your body, and if the side effects do not feel right, please consult with psych before continuing to experiment with these drugs.

When I got severely depressed I thought that no drug could help me with a terrible quality of life from 24/7 migraines that not only gave me constant pain, but prevented me from doing much of anything for the 2 and half years before.  Also having had a major stroke I was suffering from other disabilities.  A certain percentage of those suffering from chronic pain do commit suicide.  The doctor had me increase the dose and get counseling.  I never got the counseling, but 4 weeks later the depression went away--and still with the same horrible life.  Although I believe that the higher dose did help with some of my migraine pain.

I have now gone off of it and switched to Pristiq because of the lack of any sex drive.  We'll see if it improves.  

I have suffered from depression for many years and am committed to taking anti-depressants for the rest of my life, so the fear of getting off of it is not a concern.  I did in fact discontinue the Effexor while first switching to Savella which caused extreme nausea and never got it up to proper dose--now to the Pristiq.  If you taper off Effexor gradually, you can get off of it, unless you need it and then the depression will return. I had that experience as well years ago.

I had no other side effects other than the lack of sex drive--a big one."

251$Condition: Depression$12/1/2011 7:14:31 PM$Reviewer: [email protected], 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$4$I started taking Effexor XR due to mood fluctuations related to my hormones.  It worked wonders!!  I was on 75 mg. for years with no issues.  My insurance company then felt that need to substitute the brand name with generic (which I did not catch, so I could not figure out what was wrong with me), and I crashed-BIG TIME.  The generic is in no way like the brand name.  It took me a good 3 months to get back to where I was.  I have since increased to 150 mg. after the loss of my father, and slipping back a bit.  I did notice that if I fluctuate the times of taking it, even by a couple of hours, I will have a difficult time with anxiety/sweats.  Has anyone else ever experienced that?  When I called the doctor they automatically wanted to increase the dosage, but I am hesitant to do so because I am fearful that everytime I increase it gets me closer to being at the max I can take, and I don't want to ever get to a point where I can't take this med.  I am extremely med sensitive, and to find something that works for me is a godsend.  I know that the withdrawal is awful, but quite honestly, I never plan to stop taking this. 
252$Condition: Depression$11/29/2011 4:14:56 PM$Reviewer: rusmom, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years$5$5$5$I've been on this time-released drug (and now use the generic form) for almost 4 years and have remained on the 37.5 mg doing just fine. I haven't gained weight and have lost/been able to maintain my weight unlike what I was on previously. My headaches haven't increased. I'm in my mid-60's and doing fine on the drug. After reading all the horror stories that people have posted, I have to wonder why they kept upping the drug if it wasn't working for them. There are so many types of drugs for depression, you should work with your doctor to find the one that's right for you. If your current doctor doesn't help or they're just fishing for different drugs and not monitoring you, CHANGE DOCTOR'S.

It put me on an even keel, and takes away the ""fretting"" about what used to send me into a black abyss every day.  Kind of like just sweeping everything under the rug - I'm okay with that; I guess I'm happy just avoiding the problem.  The ONLY problem I have (and my Dr tells me that it is a very rare side effect) is that I can easily sleep 15 to 17 hours a day.  And, no, it isn't the depression causing that because I have tried switching to Wellbutrin which eliminated the sleeping problem.

I have tried celexa, zoloft, wellbutrin and always return. It is so important to taper SLOWLY if coming off. I thought I was in control of my depression, could get by without medication,and with my DR's supervision, tapered for 2 months to get off 75 mg daily. Going slowly, side effects are minimal. Don't even think about quitting quickly.We halved the dosage for 3 weeks, 1/2 again for 3 weeks, etc. As for weight gain, I have lost 5 lbs and have decreased appetite. It hasn't helped with hot flashes, I'm 54 and in menopause. Sometimes I have weird dreams, but overall I'm happy with the med. It got me out of my deep, dark hole and I feel like myself again.

If you carefully follow your doctor's instructions there are a number of things you can do to make the transition quite manageable (including decreasing the dose very slowly and adding a drug like Prozac).  Never stop taking Effexor without your doctor's instructions but don't be frightened away from a medication that may help your life feel worth living again.  I have been taking 300mg/day Effexor for over a year now and it is the very best thing that has helped me manage my depression.  I have always followed my Doctor's instructions and have not had any problems with the medication.  I do have to be very careful not to miss a dose though or I experience a lot of dizziness and anxiety.  I have been treated for severe depressive disorder for about 6 years and have taken a number of different different medications as part of my treatment (including Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Lamictal).  I was only getting minimal benefit from depression medications when my PCP was prescribing them but since I started seeing a psychiatrist and she put me on Effexor I have been managing so so so much better (even when my Mom died of cancer last year).  I highly recommend getting a psychiatrist and talking with them about all the pros and cons if you are considering taking Effexor.

Plain SSRIs used to work, and I have restarted Sertraline which I'd taken successfully before.  I was so unaware of the effect, I didn't even know I should be calling psychiatrist or PCP.

Yes, there are some side effects; trouble sleeping (I take it in the morning now), some weight gain (not all due to the drug I'm sure), and if I forget to take a dose, I feel dizzy (Use a weekly pill box and keep some in your purse or at work just in case). I can live with those relatively minor side effects. I can't live with the constant darkness and occasional suicidal thoughts I had before. I've been taking this medication for years, recently with the addition of Wellbutrin. I will continue taking this medication as long as I need to.

I couldn't concentrate, some days couldn't get the words out I wanted to say and tired most of the time. Best way to describe it would be living in a numb state...not depressed, but not anything, just living live a zombie.  I've been reducing dosage for the last two mths. Usually very, very passive, but first day on reduced (from 75 to 37) I was so angry I thru a bottle and put a hole in the wall. My 2nd day off it completly(today) is a nightmare! Now very ANGRY & Mean! Yelled at my elderly mom yesterday and mad at everything. Today, I'm mad one second,crying the next. Minor brain zaps,minor because I withdrew slowly, was down to aprox 15 mg when I stopped completly. For anyone contemplating taking this, PLEASE research it in detail.

I have lost a total of about 15 pounds since I started taking this medication; in which I truly needed to loose.  I am going to continue this medication because my doctor says that it could take up to six months to start helping; not that it isn't helping because it has.

It has caused a few strange things-sweating is more prominent as are the vivid dreams.  Increased blood pressure/heart rate.  If you miss a dose, you can definitely feel it within a couple hours of normal taking time.  I got pregnant a few years back and they stopped me cold turkey-DO NOT DO THIS!!!  The side effects are WORSE than taking the drug.  They finally realized this and put me back on it.  It has truly helped me, despite the negative parts-its been a life saver for me.

There are some of us who will need anti-depressants once, some who need them intermittently, and some who need them forever.  It works for me, so until it doesn't anymore, I will keep taking it."

I take 150mg/day. Is pretty effective although some days I feel like a need a larger dose. I don't really notice any side effects when I take it correctly but like other writers have mentioned DO NOT miss a dose or withdrawl kicks in immediately. I ran out once and missed 2 days and thought I had the flu or mono for a week. I can always tell immediatly if I've forgotten to take my medicine within a about 4 hours.
Remember not every medication works for every person. Also when 37.5mg may be effective for one person another may need 150mg to be effective. Do not just assume because the doctor started you out on one dose that this will work for you. Keep in close contact with your doctor so that adjustments can be made if one dose isn't working for you. I do agree though that family doctors and internists should not be allowed to prescribe psychiatric medications without scheduling psychiatrist followup with their patients first. I know my doctor wrote me the rx when I asked and then just keeps renewing it. Not a good idea. "

After doing internet research to see if anyone else out there was experiencing similiar symptons as me, I found out many described the exact symptoms as I..now I know they are withdrawal symptoms.  At least I am relieved to know that what I thought may be mini strokes is being referred to as ""brain Shevers"". When I tried to explain to my family, they thought I needed to go back to taking the effexor because they thought I was being paronoid."

I had all the side effects starting it dizziness, brain shocks, headache, nausua, slight weight loss. But after a few weeks it does go away and I felt wonderful like a had not felt in years. BUT...I have gained ALOT of weight over 20 lbs and I have more memory loss than ever and I am only 45 years old. I have not tried coming off this drug as I have read the withdrawal effects but if the vision change gets worse i may have to and I think it will be hard. So I agree DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE taking this drug and weigh the risks.

I was sent the generic for Effexor this last month thinking their wouldn't be much of a change but I started noticing that I had a total flat mood but didn't feel depressed. My anxiety increased & my blood pressure increased to a dangerous place even with taking medication so a small dose of a different medication for blood pressure was started.

I know we all react differently to meds but I have been so stable in all areas of depression, anxiety, & blood pressure that I am wondering if going to a generic could change my moods & other symptoms alone. Plus, will it begin to taper off the flat mood & help me be stable again. My anxiety & blood pressure have been affected the most."

It helped a great deal and the benefits of the drug outweighed the negatives. The negatives for me were extreme exhaustion and lack of ability to get up and do social things like I used to. I did continue to force myself to going out with my friends and became used to living with the exhaustion. Tho it was always nagging part of my life. Sleeping 11 hours + a night and still being tired. Not to mention the vivid dreams and drenching night sweats (not just sweat, but clothes are wet and sheets are wet to visible point - like an absorbed puddle almost).

After 5 years I've decided to go off the medication, I feel my life is in a much better place and I'd like to try life drug free. Also, at this time, the negatives were outweighing the positives. 

I've been on a dose of Effexor XR 150 for 5 years. I've been weaning off for a full 5 weeks under the supervision of a psychiatrist that I see once a week. It went well at first but as I'm approaching my 3rd week on a quarter does (37.5) I've become really sick. Terrible headaches every day, vomiting, dizziness, motion sickness...its really debilitating and I'm now out of sick days for work. 

Aside from the actual physical sickness, I'm also having high anxiety and could burst into tears at any point. It could be a great joy or pretty much any emotion/feeling that triggers this. 

I wish I knew what I was getting into. I don't regret my 5 years on the drug and the way it helped me get my life back in order - but I was not prepared for the terrible withdraws from this drug. "

I came off of it with a Dr. help (A PDoc not a family practitioner) over a years time. I have been off of it & on nothing for 3 years and I have lost ALL the weight and feel good. Please work with a Doctor and come off slowly. DO NOT come off of it alone or any SSRI or SRNI work with your doctor. If you need it stay on it! Also, see a therapist! Talk therapy works a pill will NOT solve it all. I recommend a book by Dr.David Burnes-Feel Good. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is amazing.

HOWEVER,  when I was prescribed Effexor, after the first few days I started having nightmares, I mean CRAZY nightmares and during the day I felt like I was in a fog.  It was the scariest feeling ever.  So I just stopped taking them. WHEW!! That's when I really thought I was losing my mind.  I called my DR but he never got back with me.  (It was a new DR)  So I got on the internet and read about it and I found all these other horror stories exactly like mine.  And you can NOT just stop taking them so as bad as I hated to I had to start back up and wean myself off them.  I take Klonopin now and it works awesome.  However,  it's not for depression, only anxiety so if you have depression you will need something with it.  I just wanted to tell my experience about Effexor,  I'm glad it helps some people, just be careful and ask a lot of questions to your DR ahead of time!!

I had to give up my job in L.A. and move to Las Vegas when my husband was transferred in 2000; this was a monumental step for me, causing great headaches and depression. 
Once when I went on a five-day cruise, I forgot to take this medication and experienced withdrawal involving nausea and stomach aches; that reaction frightened me, and I am very cautious now not to forget the appropriate amount of Effexor XR when I travel. I have had absolutely no negative side effects other than the one mentioned above. 
Many unhappy experiences have occurred in my life since 2000, but Effexor XR has helped me considerably, and I wouldn't want to change to another anti-depression medication. In fact, my doctor asked if I wanted to try Pristiq, a newer anti-depression drug; I did experience it for two or three weeks, and it was not a good or effective medication. I was teary and emotionally upset for the duration of the drug use. I returned to Effexor XR and felt completely better and more satisfied immediately.
The only drawback is the expense of Effexor XR; I run out of insurance in June, and it costs me around $400 for a 90-count the rest of the year; however, I have to continue with it because it does the job. "

I was supposed to be on it until Sept. 2010, but due to the high cost and the fact that I took my last treatment at the end of March of this year, I decided to stop taking it.  I read a lot of blogs regarding the brain shivers, insomnia, etc. and was pretty apprehensive about going ""cold turkey"", but decided that it couldn't be any worse than kicking a heroin habit.  It has been almost 2 weeks now and the first week I found myself being very emotional, crying for no reason, brain shivers, insomnia, etc. It was uncomfortable but not as bad as others have experienced.  I'm doing pretty well this week, still have the brain shivers, but they're not as frequent or as severe.  I would recommend reading the experiences of others BEFORE taking Effexor XR.  I have taken Zoloft in the past, but did not experience any withdrawal problems with it."

My doctor increased the dosage to 150 mg. 

This was where all went wrong.

The symptoms of needing an increase in dosage are similar to the symptoms of needing a decrease. I went the wrong way. 

For nearly 2 years I stayed on 150 mg- my attention span barely existed, my short-term memory was terrible, and I felt as if I was constantly in a fog-- much like the original depression. 

In an attempt to rid myself of all medicines, I quite cold turkey for about a week. The same withdrawal symptoms that everyone talks about- the brain ""zaps"", dizziness, headaches, shaking, etc.- consumed me. 

What I did next saved my life in many ways. I went to ANOTHER doctor who put me on 37.5 mg. I began to feel stable for once. I felt as if I was back again; I felt like me. I have been on 37.5 mg now for a while, and all is well. I have no outbursts, no lows, and even no manic states. 

I truly believe that people's many bad experiences with Effexor are due to over-medication."

I went from Celexa to Effexor XR 75mg. and after, 1 week 150 mg. I had feelings like a panic attack (except I knew I wasn't dying). I fortunately had been on it such a short time (1 wk at 150 mg), I weened myself back off just like the dr. had weened my dose up. I think there are newer, or at least better meds. I also have chronic pain and major digestive probs which were made worse. I had been on Celexa for 12 yrs. Why mess with something that works?

You dont get warnings on this before taking this drug.  Look/google it up and read the horror stories before you decide to take this drug... You will be sooooo sick no matter what when you try to get off this drug.....tons of people can not get off because of how bad the withdrawl is.  You just can not function...You are to ill to move, you get so dizzy you vomit, you get weird brain zapping feelings, you cant concentrate, I was afraid to drive it was so bad and so on... #2 Now being off this drug and the side effects slowing  I feel so alive, motivated, happy,I can finally poop like normal and sex !! Being on Effexor you might as well forget sex... I forgot how fun it was (lol). I had no idea what this drug did to me, looking back just a month later and how I feel now,,,,Was I a walking zombie?...I dont know but Im so happy to be off it....I would not recommend Effexor to anyone!!!

449$Condition: Depression$6/5/2010 5:36:35 PM$Reviewer: Ethomas99, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$1$If you're reading reviews because you are considering taking Effexor, PLEASE READ THIS. I hope this medication gets taken off the market. I was put on 37.5 mg in a psychiatric ward while I was suffering extreme depression from drug abuse and psychosis in 2006. It helped a lot. My brain was so imbalanced from my drug use that at the time, I needed medication. However, the initial euphoric reaction I had to it faded, and my quack doctor increased my dosage more and more. By 2008 I was on 300 mg, the maximum dose. I stayed on it, out of fear. Why was I afraid? Because missing a dose even by a matter of hours made me experience severe withdrawal. In the beginning, I dropped 30 pounds in 3 months, but then gained it all back slowly and no matter how healthy I ate or how often I excersised, I couldn't lose weight. My hair also stopped growing. Finally with enough support from family and friends, I tapered down. It's taken almost 2 years to go from 300 to 75 mg. Each time I taper, I have debilitating withdrawal. Nausea, sweating, anxiety, mood swings, body aches, brain zaps (feels like fireworks going off in my head) and extreme trouble organizing thoughts. But my hair grew and I lost weight. My mood became stable and I was generally more upbeat. I stopped getting overly upset at small things and my energy skyrocketed. I have to wonder what must be in this medication that makes withdrawal reduce me to the fetal position, crying in a pool of sweat, and taking less of it makes my hair grow and restores my metabolism. I can't wait to be done with this. It's taken me to hell and back. It traps you into a physical dependency that makes it impossible to skip a dose or stop, because withdrawal is so scary and the half life is so short that if I forget to take it and leave for work in the morning, I have to anticipate getting sick by the afternoon. STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF, IT'S EVIL.

It was the scariest experience in my 20 years since diagnosis.  Fortunately I was able to get the drug from Wyeth and am again stable.

There's no point in suffering when there is something that can immediately help. After reading countless ""caveats"" about coming off it, I weaned myself off very slowly and with direction from my Dr. I reduced my dosage by 37.5mg 1 month at a time.  IT WORKED VERY VERY WELL.  I experienced little to no withdrawel symptoms.  I've been off the med for about 10 weeks.  Sadly I'm beginning to have more episodes of feeling depressed; not being able to get out of bed, having little-to-no energy, and am probably going to go back on it.  I really wanted to be ""free and clear"" of the med and I'm not sure that it's possible. Some people have a chemical imbalance and it's beyond their control.

I suddenly began having a dizziness that was unexplained.  Emotionally, I felt good though, and thought maybe it was time to get off the drug.  I reduced my dosage down to 37.5 for two weeks, then cut the few remaining pills in half for about 10 days.  What ensued from there has been a nightmare.  I was having severe brain shivers most of the day every day for over two weeks.  Brain shivers are like an electrical stimulus to your brain.  My emotions and sensitivity to light and sound were severe.  My doctor was totally unavailable to me during this process.  It has now been over a month and all of these symptoms are still happening, although to a lesser degree.  However, I believe this is a VERY dangerous drug and would recommend against starting it.  If you are on it, try switching to something less severe and then titrate off.  There is no way of knowing the length of time I will have to suffer with these symptoms and apparently there is no relief from them.

After about 4 years, I opted for anotber due to the horrific weight gain. My Dr. recommended Effexor CR. I started at 35 mg and went to 75 shortly afterwards which I was happy with. In January 2009, I opted to see if I was able to do without the meds. I slowly reduced my dosage from 75 to 35 over 5 months. By my sixth month, I was 100% antidepressant free. My withdrawal symptoms by weaning myself off slowly were minimal, but due to the high stress of my job and my minds tendency to make things much, much bigger and dramatic than what they really are I decided, along with my Dr.'s recommendation, to return to taking Effexor CR. The side affects such as sexual, weight gain, forgetfulness are minimual in comparison to being without it....at least at this time in my life. Maybe some day. Just not right now.

I was on each of those anti-depressants for long enough periods of time to know that they were doing nothing for my depression.  Effexor XR, started at 37.5mg a day, increased to 75, increased to 112.5, increased to 150 and finally to 300mg per day and I have almost forgotten what depression is.  It's the best treatment I have ever been on for my moderate to severe depression.  And all with not one adverse side effect.  Oh, well, except for the weight gain.  I'll take the extra pounds in exchange for the heavy weight that has been lifted, for seeing a vivid world instead of a gray world.

They were really bad when I missed multiple doses (because I did not have a refill).  I take them in the morning because if taken in the afternoon or evening I get terrible insomnia.  My body jumps a lot when I sleep.  Recently, I changed prescription providers and started to get the zappy feeling even when I take the medication and do not miss a dose.  I read in another review that increased exercise or sweating caused this person to get that zappy side effect so I'm thinking that is a possible cause of my zappy feelings instead of pharmacy issues.  I take 225 mg/day and still get terrible PMS every month.  I've been on the medication for over 5 years with a steady increase in the dosage.  I am afraid to stop taking this medication, even with the consultation of my doctor, because of the withdrawal side effects.

This also helped with nausea and vertigo in the early stages until enough accumulated in my system. The reverse happened when I was first  weaned off it.So taking it at night was right for me and it also kept me awake during the day so I slept better at night. However the weight gain, high blood pressure and cholesterol have caused me to decide that the side affects could possibly be more dangerous for me than the depression. Anyway I have decided to very gradually get off Efexor, again and hopefully forever, with the help of my doctor.I agree that it is most important to be as knowledgeable as possible before deciding to take it.

Was told by family Dr. Efexor 'was not addictive'(you can become addictive to anything really), I would need to take forever and that if I weaned off it it I would need higher does to bring me around the next time.I did successfully drop 75mg daily for 2 years. It was not what I believe to be depression that returned. No sleep for 3 days lead to my mind running 100 miles a minute while my body seemed to move in slomo. This is one serious drug. Returned to Efexor 150mg and I awoke to electrical impulses in my head that were likefireworks and my body shook uncontrolably Result meds increased  to 175 mls. been ok for 4 yrs but weight increase caused hypertention which caused mild stroke so now i'm on stroke whatch.. Whatever decision we make about medication it all comes down to quality of life... and what the alternatives are. So research and research again then make an educated decision whether to continue or not.

I fly off the handle quite a bit. My husband would describe me as ""hyper"" a lot of the time.  I tried weaning off of this drug while increasing a new med - Wellbutrin - at the recommendation of my doctor.  The withdrawal from the effexor, once I was completely off of it - was HORRIBLE!  Brain zaps, dizziness, night terrors (even when taking an afternoon nap) - oh, and very very tired - I started just curling up on the bed and falling asleep once I was off of the Effexor. The Wellbutrin gave me serious stomach problems, so this doc said ""I don't want you taking anything (meaning anti-depressents) until we know what's going on with you.""  Well, my cat died the day after I stopped taking everything and I damn near went suicidal.  I mean I went completely beserk, had crying jags, etc.  Got back on EffexorXR (37.5 mg) immediately per my primary care physician's insistence. I have since found new medication psychiatrist who suggested that maybe the Effexor's effect on my norephinephrine was just too much for me.  At least at my current low Effexor dose 37.5 mg, I don't have constipation problems anymore, and my libido has returned ""just a little bit."" (thank goodness).  I'm ramping up on Zoloft again (per doc's suggestion) - it did wonders for me when I first started taking in in 1994-2006 (and I lost weight, too) so maybe it will help me again.  I sure need something to pull me out of my current depression.  But the Effexor WITHDRAWAL effects ARE HORRIBLE - and I'm a little bit scared of going completely off of it for that reason."

I was so excited but after about 3 weeks I had to go off it because the side effects became too much for me. I had many, and some may have been allergic reactions. I experienced: tremors, fainting, loss if coordination, insomnia, blurred vision, peeling rash around my mouth, racing heart, irregular heart beat, & shortness of breath among some other things. I went off cold turkey and the withdrawls were awful but I needed to get off it quickly. It was very disappointing since it was working better than any other anti depressant I'd been on...

I had been on various dosages of Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil with either poor side effects (inability to orgasm) or poor effectiveness. Doc put me on 150mg of Effexor XR. It helped my depression, anxiety and libido but the side effects and withdrawl were horrible and TOTALLY debilitating! 

I was getting my prescriptions through MedCo's mail order system so it was very easy to be out of meds and at least 3 days from getting any more. The worst withdrawl symptom was a nauseous dizzy feeling in my head. I could not move around without feeling as though my brain were somewhat disconnected from my head. It would worsen with each day to the point of nearly vomiting! Let me be very clear here, I could not move my body without feeling like I was going to barf! And I have an iron stomach! 

Another serious effect that I have experienced is hand tremors. It has been 12 years since I began taking Effexor XR and 4 years since I stopped and my hands still shake, sometimes so bad that people ask me if I have Parkinson's Disease!! Most of the time people say nothing but look at me like I am a junkie! I have been to the Doc and they ran tests and have no explanation- even though I KNOW that I never had this problem until I went on Effexor XR. 

I would recommend this pill because it helped me overcome a severe depression but I caution strongly against it if you have a hard time keeping a pill schedule. 

The Doc's didn't want me to go off of the pill. They said depression was ""in my genes"" and I would fight it my whole life. Well, as a biologist, let me tell you that THAT is NOT always the case. I have been anti-depressant free for 4 years and I have never felt more clear, fresh, raw and happy than I do now. Sure there are bummers, sometimes every day. But I just focus on the good parts and count my blessings with my shakey fingers every moment I remember to! "

Effexor was the 3rd anti-depressant they put me on (I was sick of being a zombie every day on anti-depressants).

However, if you are considering this medciation, you should be aware that it is very important not to miss a dose.  It causes a very uneasy/uncomfortable feeling...kind of like a hangover, but light-headed and dizzy.  Even being a little late taking it can cause these symptoms so you should get in the habit of taking it at the same time every day.  Another thing to be careful of...don't stand or raise up to quickly or you can become very light headed

Paxil-made me sleep my life away. Zoloft-felt like a zombie. Wellbutrin-made me extremely moddy. Celexa-awful neck pain & my jaw would clench. The only problem I had with effexor was how huge-dialated my pupils got. I hate to sound so picky but my eyes are greenish-hazel so if my pupils dialated, it was really obvious and I felt really self-consious about it. I'm taking about like my pupils were almost as big as my eye. I thought people might think i was on some illegal drugs, so I just decided to go off the meds. WOW, major withdrawl symptoms. It's hard to say, if I had dark colored eyes, I would def stay with this med. I hadn't felt so good in a long time, and it worked awesome for both depression and anxiety! Will try Lexapro next

If you are even late on a dose, it starts with the creepy lightheadedness that makes you feel off...then comes the nausea.  After 4 days off one time (due to finances), i felt like dying.

I was without it for a few months from an insurance problem and had to go off cold turkey and I will say that it was terrible for the withdrawal, though nothing as bad as the horror stories I have read from other people.  The biggest problem for me was not the withdrawal however, it was that nothing else that I tried worked for me.  I wound up fixing the problem with the insurance and went back on it.  Even knowing what the withdrawal entails, if the benefit outweighs the risk... that's the basis for all meds.  My experience with this med has been a lot more positive than the stories I have read. Regardless if people say that it's addictive and regardless if I ever wind up having to go through the withdrawals again if my insurance drops coverage again... this is an essential med for me and I will take advantage of the benefits it brings for as long as I am able to.  Without it I am a crying miserable wreck and completely overwhelmed by my depression.  With it there are still depression factors but at a level I can live with.  I do take four other psych meds along with the effexor and my current dose is 150mg/day.  Just for reference, the other meds are buspar, klonopin, seroquel and lamictal.  No benefit from trials of prozac, wellbutrin or celexa.

I have gone through withdrawals from a severe addiction to a very strong illegal drug and THAT wasn't even this bad! It caused vertigo as well as horrible sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, eye pain from the light, and the worst mood swings ever! My husband had to take me to the ER because he found me on the kitchen floor and all the chairs were knocked over, apparently I had fallen. I couldn't remember anything at all until an hour after I had taken a dose of the effexor which the doctor had given me. 

Also.  Since I have been on the effexor, I have become an anti-social zombie. I barely get out of bed and my already lack of motivation turned into a lack of life period. The only thing I like about this medication is the fact that it stabilizes my mood, well... more like it keeps me mono-toned 100% of the time. I no longer have extreme lows or highs."

I have been on every anti-depressant.  Effexor is the worst and the withdrawal when weaning off of it was pure hell.  The withdrawal was so bad that the doctor had to put me back on it at four times the dosage I was taking!  I cannot believe I lived through taking and withdrawing from this drug.  They should take it off of the market!  God bless anyone who takes this awful drug.

The standard course of treatment was prescribed, therapy and drugs. After two years of meds and less than satisfactory results Effexor got its turn. Finally, I had relief, for a few months. Effectiveness tapered off, dosage increased, then combination with other meds. Sound familiar, after 10 years enough of this. The treatment is worse than the illness. My answer is healing prayer and neurofeedback therapy. Get off the chemical highway, it wont cure and is endless.

I tried other drugs, but they didn't work or made me really ill. I also have problems with severe anxiety and this has really helped! I can always tell if I've forgotten to take it though, and I have read the other comments about coming off of it. If I miss a day I get nauseated and woosie. It has caused me to have high blood pressure, but, when I think of how much better I feel and how it helps the anxiety, well, I guess it's worth it. 
641$Condition: Depression$11/9/2009 9:59:50 PM$Reviewer: triplet mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I started taking this drug for severe chronic depression and anxiety. Beginning this drug, I was vomiting right away, so make sure you take it with food. The side effects get better as you continue taking it, and rather quickly. After taking this drug for 2 months though, the drug was helping immensley with the anxiety, but making my depression much worse! I began hallucinating and hearing voices & whispers, and became very suicidal. I slept alot, had zero energy or desire to do anything. I wouldn't shower for days and couldn't even get basic things done. I am now weaning off of it to start something new (Celexa), and the weaning has been fine except that I notice that I am much more aggitated and irritable, and anger very quickly. Anxiety attacks are coming back as well. I have back problems, so I also take muscle relaxers, pain killers, and nerve relaxers as well. Not sure if there is an interaction going on? It's very hard to be patient with finding a drug to work for you. I am half tempted to try the medical marijuana to see if that helps with pain and anxiety?

It's hard to remember how or if it was effective in the beginning. I have been batteling SEVERE depression for over 10 yrs and spent 5 of those yrs in bed. I've been on all kinds of meds in different combos and ultimately came off everything 2 yrs ago except for the effexor. I CANT stOP. If I go even 2 days without it the brain zaps are terrible. Fortunately I don't seem to be having any of the other side effects many of you have talked about ie no wt gain or moodiness that I can see but how do you differentiate the moodiness of the med effect from the symptoms of the depression itself? If I really knew that ex was still helping me I wouldn't mind it so much but I just don't know if it really is helping or if I'm staying on it to avoid the withdrawl of stopping. Also I don't have insurence and it's expensive to stay on it just to stop the withdrawl. Still I have found that most other meds I have tried have had worse side effects. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to meds now that I have tried so many but with some meds I would forget what I was saying half way through a sentence. It was awful. If I try again to get off ex I would do it over a 1 yr period. I don't know what to do. I'm still classified as severly depressed but at least I'm working and interacting with people again. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

I have been tapered down to the 37.5 mg level (I had been up to 300mg) but I can not quit the drug completely!!!  Even at this low dose, I experience the extreme effects I did when I forgot my medication while on vacation.  One side effect I did not realize I had was a complete lack of interest in sex!  Now that I am down to the lower dose, my sex drive is back thankfully & my energy has increased.  I have lost 15 pounds due to diet & exercise since lowering my dose.

659$Condition: Depression$10/26/2009 4:14:39 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I began taking this med in '08 after trying lexapro and wellbutrin, which did not work for me. I took 75 mg once a day (effexor xr). AFter one week I immediate felt relief and felt like my depression was being treated! I felt wired at first, dry mouth, nausea...the side effects it states you will have. But they eventually went away. I stayed on this med for 6mths, but since I planned to have a baby, I went off of it. The only withdrawal symptmos I had were the brain zaps, but I gradually withdrew the amount I was taking by breaking open the capsule. I only had to do this for 2 weeks. Now after having the baby, I am on this med again...this time on the generic form. Same initial symptoms. I have been taking it for 3 weeks now and I already feel like my head is clearer and I'm not as angry. I think with these types of medicines you have to just try to see if they do work for you or not. Just b/c someone else had awful reactions or withdrawals does not mean you will! With any of these drugs that affect you physiological system, you do risk that possibility of withdrawal symptoms!

Pretty severe postpartum depression. Worked very well and was happy with the results for the next 2 years. 

At one point my Dr tried to wean me off, but soon realized it was a bad idea. Within one week I had serious thoughts of suicide...did not actually attempt but the desire was very strong.

Now I feel like a prisoner to this medication. I experience erratic mood swings, paranoia, apathy, no sex drive, jitters. My body/brain won't let me sleep until very late at night, so I'm always tired and lethargic.
I was once an outgoing person, and now i'm reclusive and anti-social.

It is FDA approved up to 225mg/day, but many doctors prescribe way higher than this with good results.  I saw one post on here where the person said the drug didn't work and they were at 37.5mg/day.  Yes, the drug will have virtually no effect on you at that low dosage!!

I've been on it a year and I'm at 300mg/day.  It is a wonderful medicine, but I don't like the sweating and the fact that it raises blood pressure.  People, DO NOT trust your primary care or family doctor to know about these psychoactive drugs.  They mean well, but a Psychiatrist is where you need to go for the guys who know everything about psychoactive drugs.  Also, I am not a doctor, nor do I work for a drug company.  I just wanted to throw some facts out there for people to use so that they can be helped.

Missed a dose, here and there, and the withdrawal was intense.  The electric shock feeling was terrifying the first time. I complained to my doctor ans was told that the ""shock"" feeling might actually be a plummet in saratonin levels.  So, on my own, I cut back, first to 75mg per day and then half again.  I was able to go dose free for 2-3 days before the ""shock"" would come and I'd take a pill.  I continued just treating the ""shocks"" as they came until I was pill free for days, then weeks at a time.  If you are ready to wean off Effexor, get your doctor to lower and break up your dosage (instead of 2x75mg per day, ask for 4x32.5). This will help you begin slowly skipping one dose and so on.  Effexor is a fantastic medication and it doesn't have to be a nightmare (literally) to come off it.  Pay attention to your ""shocks"" or crashes as you lower your dosage and treat only when you feel them.  It will work.  I was completely off the medication within three months and I had very little hardship. "

It helped me through a very rough time in my life. By July, my head was feeling weird ( i.e. strange pressure behind my eyes, trouble focusing, apathy, swore I heard music in my head) and I was weaned off of it. I was receiving psychiatric counseling also so I had some good coping mechanisms already in place. Almost 3 months later, I am still getting a headache at the same time every day. My focus is back,the pressure behind my eyes went away and no more music but I don't think I can recommend this drug for more than 3 months at a time. The withdrawal headache for me is minor but for some, withdrawals from this drug are terrible.

I started hearing music in my head when hospitalized in April & it continues to date. About 2-3 mos after I fell & fractured my pelvis, my hair started falling out & still is. I have dry mouth,hoarseness, difficulty at times swallowing. Been blaming everything on the recovery from the fall, but now I wonder. I'm going to call my dr tomorrow & try to get off this.

There are no side affects unlike the other ones ive tried and even if i do miss a dose i just stay in bed (as you can get an annoying not painful brain shake symptom) but within an hour of taking the missed tablets the shakes dissappear.  I would recommend effoxer xr to anyone with severe depression, also i wouldnt change it for anything.

I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. I have a great life and wonderful family, but because of this pill, I just can't be happy. I talked to my Dr. but he refuses to change my meds or prescribe something else. I have tried to wean off of it, but the withdrawls are worse than detoxing off of opiates. I AM STUCK IN A HELL OF MY OWN. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never taken this drug.

I also had a horrible experience where I went on vacation & forgot my medication.  The withdrawl symptoms started the next day.  I was completely floored by what happened to me; the dizziness, sweating, headache, brain zaps & lack of ability to concentrate were severe.  I was also completely drained of energy.  I have been on a lower dose for about a week now, and none of the side effects, just a lingering tiredness.  So far, so good.  

I would urge all patients to seek treatment other than Effexor & tell doctors that if they feel they MUST prescribe it, to let the patient in on the symptoms they will experience when they get off the drug, or even miss a dose.  

Im sure if I would have known the problems associated with Effexor XR, I would have NEVER, EVER taken this drug.  I would suggest everyone else to do the same."

Do have the side effect of elongnated ejactulation during sex and sometimes the most basic of words don't come to me and its frustrating. I take 300mg. a day and the side effects are pretty tough if you come off of it. I have resigned the fact that I will be on a drug for my life for depression and anxiety and in no way would I go back to the life I had prior to this medication. For the first time in my life I know how people live i.e. not being paranoid, worried or nervous all the time.

I was working in a stressful environment, and I realized that my depression was getting worse, like a heavy weight that kept getting heavier.  The effexor has helped with that, but I found it does not keep my anxiety levels down, so I take it in combination with a low dose of paroxitine for anxiety.  So far this has been effective, and I have been on the regimen for over a year now.  I was diagnosed in 1998, and have taken only Paxil (paroxitine) until I began this regimen.

Coming off of it I did experience brain zaps which I found slightly annoying. If I missed more than one dose I would be sick to my stomach. I had to make sure I took it at the same time each day.

I sought out help in my final year of college. The Health Center DR put me on this and it worked. It worked for me for the whole time. There was one lul where watching a movie with a lighter in my hand (as i just lite a candle While watching 1408) the fire scene came on and i thought to myself... I could light this lighter and drop my hand and it would look like the movie. (I never have thought like that EVER) I was already working on coming off this drug as I was ALWAYS sweating and I wanted to end the medication life. Every night was filled with sweat, all winter long I was sweating, ACTUALLY I didnt mind it because I was warm when it was Cold. The other side effect I got was if I missed my dose even by 3 hours if I was walking I which ever direction i would turn that hand would go numb. The weaning off was not too hard, but I took it slow with an actual physician, I went down 37.5mgs each month. When it came to the end I felt like crap for about a week, the sweating ended after about a month. It has now been out of my system since March 09 and its July09. I look back at the last year and a lot of it, was a blur due to this medication.
746$Condition: Depression$7/26/2009 5:40:55 PM$Reviewer: Butterfly, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$5$"I was initially precscribed Effexor XR to treat my severe dailey migraines along with several other drugs At that time I was not diagnosed with depression although, I suspect my doctor thought that was the cause of my headaches. I had mild relief but, still had dailey headaches. About 4 years ago my doctor recommended Botox injections. We found that the combination of Effexor and the botox injections (every 3 months) was the winning combination. After 47 odd years of severe to incajpacitating migraines, I AM FINALLY HEADACHE FREE. I take one 250 mg Effexor in the morning and another at bedtime. As to side effects, I can't comment as I'm on several other medications with the same side effects, namely dry mouth and eyes.  However, it's more than worth it to only have occassional. normal headaches (like when it's approaching time for the botox) and very rarely a severe one.  I'm, naturally, very pleased with the Effexor. 
I was unaware of the withdrawal problems but, will probably be on it forever so I'm not worrying about that now."

I could actually see something happen- like i noticed that i was changing, and i was back to my old self again. Then about a few months later it just stopped working. IDKY- it just did. and now my episodes have came back, and they are stronger. Not to mention I get tired- a LOT easier now and can't get enough sleep- even when i take it just before bed. I also find myself having way more panic attacks, so the doc has upped the RX and decided to try piggy backing with another. So we shall see how this one goes! I mean it really did work- and hopefully it will again.

I had no side effects, except for a 40 pound weight gain over the 4 yrs that I was on it. The weight gain was bad enough, but worse than that is trying to get off this drug.

As long as I am on it I am very much in control and have no anxiety at all. Once a Dr. tried to take me off of it and it was the worst week of my life, so I agree totally with the comments related to the withdrawl issues. Also I travel a lot overseas and a couple of times I have either forgotten to pack it or it was in my luggage that did not arrive on time. If you are on a high dosage it can be difficult to get foreign Dr's to prescribe your normal dosage, so triple check that it is in your carry-on before you leave.

My doctor is weaning me off while trying something new (Cymbalta). So far, so good, but we are taking it in baby steps. Once before, she tried weaning me off it and I just had to give up and stay on it because of the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. The so-called ""brain zaps"" were horrible. I thought I was going to die. I had the worst of both worlds: depression increasing as withdrawal symptoms were getting worse. I am hoping for an easier transition. The medication did work for many, many years, so overall I am satisfied, but for me, the withdrawal symptoms were too much to bear."

771$Condition: Depression$7/9/2009 3:22:20 PM$Reviewer: difficulty weaning off, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$2$1$This medication worked well for me while taking it. If I missed a dose by even a few hours I would begin to get dizzy and have odd sensations in my brain. When I attempted to wean off the medication I had a lot of trouble. The Dr. lowered my dose to the lowest doseage and I did that for a while with minimal dizziness and odd sensations but everytime I tried to skip a day and get on that portion of the weaning off I would get terrible dizziness, bumping into things, hearing a creaking noise in my brain and having memory difficulties. My balance was entirely off. I did the one day inbetween for longer than my Dr. originally anticipated. The Dr. said he has never seen a patient have such difficulty weaning off a medication. I missed 2 days of work over the course of this and am on vacation as I write this. I haven't taken the medication at all in 4 days and the problems are fairly minimal. This has been more difficult to quit than quiting smoking. It concerns me that a medication can alter some process in the brain that when removing the medication from the system, following the process of doing so, causes such severe changes in my natural chemestry. I don't know if this experience is unique to me but if someone has difficulties with medications I would avoid this one if there is a different choice.

DO NOT TAKE!!!I have watched my mother, who has never taken a recreational drug in her life struggle with this drug almost killing her (literally) from the withdrawl symptoms. She began taking it to treat her hot flashes and depression and built up to 225mg. All was well and wonderful, that is until she ran out of insurance, lost her company and could no longer afford the outrageously expensive drug. She stopped taking the drug and began to feel like she was shutting down, physically and mentally. I have struggled with opiate addiction for a few years now and i think there is no worse feeling than the withdrawl you experience when quitting. that was until i saw my mom go through this. she went to the hospital for what she was feeling (not knowing it was effexor withdrawl) and they told her that her body was literally shutting down. Once she started telling them the medication and dose she was on, they knew right away it was the effexor. since then she has only been able to ween down to 75mgs, due to the fact that YOU CAN LITERALLY DIE FROM THE WITHDRAWL OF THIS DRUG. She feels too awful when she tries to take any lower of a dose. She feels like she cant control any mental functions, she feels out of body, horrific nightmares, can't sleep right, complete physical drain, awful rages. And thats just the symptoms that wont actually kill you!!!Just take the time to research the class action lawsuit against Wyeth. And the thousands of blogs about the people going through the same things i have described here. Please just don't take this drug, i wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy.

I tried Lexapro (did not like and did not seem to work), Paxil (worked but was too powerful with side effects), Remeron (did not seem to work and had little to no side effects), and Welbutrin (did not seem to work as well as Effexor ""for me""). One thing is for sure, all of these meds cause grief when missing a dose or trying to stop. Paxil was by far the worst if I missed a dose. I have always taken low dosages of these meds but they seem to even me out. Effexor does not cause side effects at 75mg but at 150mg I was having libo issues and it did not seem to help me in any way that was apparent or measureable. Effexor XR can be missed for about one day but come the second day I get headaches, the zaps and dizzy headed. Some of the other meds I tried could not be missed by one day without terrible withdrawl symptoms. I might try a Welbutrin/Effexor combo but it will be a minimal dose for both.

Overall, works great for me.

I've been on so many other anti-depressants that their effects eventually wore off.  I did experience the vivid dreams (nightmares sometimes), thirst, lack of sexual desire, insomnia, anxiety, but the worst part towards the end was the tiredness.  I was what my doctor called a state of hibernation.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I couldn't wake up in the morning, I'd nap at lunch and go to bed as soon as I got home from work.

Wow, that's no fun.  I will never say to someone, ""hey snap out of it"" Life works in funny ways sometimes.  Anyways, was forced to get help with the depression. Started with lowest dose 37.5 for 10 days, then 75mg for 14 days and to date at 75 + 37.5 = 112.5mg.  The hardest part was waiting for it to work, It took atleast 5/6 weeks. I wanted to quit many times, but stuck with it. Weird side effects along the way but help from Dr., Therapist and friends helped. The other problem was I expected when it did work to immediately make the depression just go away.  Found out ""it don't work that way"" I guess the depression came on slowly (thou I never realized) and it goes away slowly.  So I seemed to feel best in the evening and worst in the morning. Dr. said that's normal with depression. The other hurdle to get over is I'll be feeling like my old self for a day or two and ""boom"" out of the clear blue it creeps back.  Which at first really scared me and pissed me off.  How dare it, after all that hard work. But, with patience I slowly start feeling better again. Quite a roller coaster ride. To date, I have more better days than bad days. Having to work hard at feeling just ""normal"" does suck.  But life is worth it. With so many horrible things that can happen to us, I try to feel fortunate compared to those who have no real hope.  Regarding people with suicide thoughts, as long as you keep them as thoughts, just don't act on them.  I'm sure every adult has wondered about suicide at some point. Someone once told me that suicide is a ""Final solution to a Temporary problem"". Think about it very true.
Depression/Anx are the most treatable of mental disorders.  So hang in there, take baby steps, and believe in the BIG Guy.  That's all I'm doing. "

I have been off it for a week and I am constantly dizzy (even feel dizzy in my dreams) and often nauseous.  I am also really irritable and am trying to avoid my co-workers so I don't bite anyone's head off for no reason. When I'm not irritable I feel weepy and lately anxious and paranoid.  I have already started taking Wellbutrin and I think it is helping.  It is very frustrating that none of the literature talks about length of withdrawal symptoms.  I know it's different for everyone but surely someone has measured this in a test group and can publish the results from that group.  I haven't even been able to find a comment anywhere from someone saying they managed to get off it and are now finally feeling better.  Very disheartening.  Published tests of new drugs should include discontinuation symptoms and observed length of those symptoms. There is no good reason to exclude that data.

It helps me get through the day and helps me sleep better at night.  

I began taking Effexor 6 years ago, starting with the lowest dosage, currently I take the highest dosage.  

It must be taken daily for it to be effective, and be warned, do NOT stop taking it cold turkey.  Missing a pill causes vertigo (dizziness), nausea and fatigue.  

The drug does not mix well with alcohol.  If you do drink, be advised, you will 'hit the wall' rather quickly, and likely sprial into a depression episode.  

If taken correctly it is a miracle drug and I plan on taking it the rest of my life. It may not be for everyone, but it probably saved my life.

I would not say my depression has lifted 100%, which is a rare case, but probably about 80%, which gets me through most days. It was prescribed about 5-6 yrs ago by my PCP, when I saw him for the first time. I had been on Lexapro, Celexa and Paxil previously, (not at the same time), but with each of those meds, after taking them for about 6 months to a year, I began to have very very vivid dreams, not exactly nightmares, but vivid enough to really disturb my sleep and not allow me to function well the next day. This HAS NOT happened with EFFEXOR XR 150mg, even after all this time. 
Also, about 2 yrs ago I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia,and we tried taking me off Effexor a few months ago and going on Cymbalta, to kill two birds with 1 stone, so to speak, but I had a horrible reaction to the Cymbalta (the Fibro actually got much worse) and I went back to Effexor. This seems to be the best antidepressant for me with the fewest side effects, maybe dry mouth, and some sleepiness, nothing major. Unless I miss a dose. DO NOT MISS A DOSE! If you wish to reduce your dosage or get off the drug altogether, do not do so without a dr's advise, otherwise you will feel like a truck hit you.
My conclusion, for me: it works, and I will continue to use it.     "

I started this medication after being severely depressed.  It was a great drug while I was on it.  I didnt cry all the time, or anything like that.  In fact, I was quite numb to everything around me.  But after 3 years or so of being on it, I was going to lose my insurance, and Effexor is way too expensive, so I decided to get off of it.  And let me tell you, that was the worst decision I have ever made.  The withdrawal effects were so severe.  I ended up checking into a psychiatric ward.  I had brain zaps, nausea, constant crying.  In fact, it is a year after I stopped taking this medication, and I still have severe nausea.  This medication was good while I was on it.  So basically, if you are prescribed this medication, plan on being on it for the rest of your life.

My fam doc and accompanying info with the script did NOT talk about it; otherwise I would NEVER have taken it. And there's NOTHING to help with this nightmare but ""ride it out"".

I had headaches 5-7 times a week but thought that was just me - I've had headaches for years.  I was fatigued but thought I just had no will power to exercise, and improve my fitness.   I would only sleep about 5 hours a night, I had no energy.   I was slower in everything I did eg, speech, typing, decision making domestic chores.     During the Dr-scheduled withdrawal I had headaches, diarrhea, shakes and felt dreadful - I was sent home from work twice. 

AFTER withdrawing  the facial sweating and headaches STOPPED;  I had increased libido and upswings in moods.  My speed of speech, processing, decision making and implementation increased significantly (I work in an environment where constant statistics are taken throughout every shift.  I have gone from 'Performance Management"" - ie, your performance is below standard and your job is at risk - to beating targets in an incredibly short period of time - since withdrawing from the Effexor¬).

The downside is that after a honeymoon period of about 10-12 days my anxiety increased so much that today I have been put on another medication  (Lexapro) to control it.  I'M HOPING my body will better tolerate it  however I will know better what to look for instead of assuming these problems are all personal attributes uninfluenced by medication side effects as everyone of them improved since coming off the Effexor.  
SUMMARY:
The Effexor definitely controlled depression and anxiety (though from time to time I still felt both) but the cost in side effects was VERY high and if the facial sweating had not started YEARS after taking the medication, indicating I was experiencing a side effect, I would still be taking Effexor & suffering all of the side effects, whic"

The side effects are dry mouth, an abundance of mental energy and feeling quite comfortable, not wanting to venture out of the house or do errands. It doesn't interfere with sexual activity (as it does for some). I can, but prefer not to drive for @ 2 hours after dosing. I am convinced that I have been in 2 minor fender benders due to rapid thinking and acting.

After trying a couple other medications to treat my depression and slight anxiety, Effexor worked wonders. However, I have since been weaned off of it in the past few months (trying to get pregnant), and I have found that, while my depression has lessened, my anxiety and irritablity has gown through the roof. It is far worse than it was before I was put on the effoexor in the first place. I am now taking Buspar for my anxiety because it may be a little safer for pregnancy, but I am still incredibly high strung. I plan to get back on it after my pregnancy.

I was to go 2 weeks lower does of effexor and then 4 days later add the celexa. Well rollercoaster ride I was on the first three days of lowering the dose to 75mg I was wired with energy you wouldnt believe then slowly felt better with the celexa it took a little bit for me to get used to the medication switch and so forth. Well now its been two weeks off of the effexor and its a very hard drug to get off so just be careful. I have felt very dizzy, lightheadedness at times throughout the day. It feels as though you have had nothing to eat and your sugar is dropping even if you have eaten already. That shakey tingly feeling. You will have it in spurts for a few days, you might get panic attacks if you have had trouble with them in the past. They dont last long but they last for only about 10 minutes or so.

I was on the highest legal dosage at the time (I don't know if it's changed since then) and would get horrid nightmares if I forgot to take it, and it made me sleepy all the time.  Since going off, I can't remember a lot of what happened that year I was on it, and I developed intense sensitivity in my two front teeth, particularly troublesome as a clarinetist.  I discovered after a visit to an endodontist that they sometimes use this to block nerves to the teeth.  Had I been aware of this possible side effect, I never would have taken it.  My career as a clarinetist ended at 19 because the drug was too new and doctors didn't know it could do this to me.  I never wanted to go on anti-depressants in the first place, and I'm not happy I was on this.

The withdrawal period was the worst time in my entire life. The best way to get off it, if you are looking, is to reduce the dose VERY SLOWLY. Talk to your doctor, and come up with a plan to reduce dosage. I have read on other sites that people just stopped after 75mg, but that is what I was on initially. I had to cut it in half every week over the course of several weeks. I would advise taking a different drug as this is seriously not worth the pain of getting off it.

Anyway I am still trying to get off them. I have been on about 17.5 mg for 8 months now. For about 5 months I have been only taking the 1/4 tablet every few days, just when I start getting the withdrawl symptoms. The symptoms are awful. I have tried and waited about 24-30 hours after symptoms start to see if they might go away but in that amount of time they never have and I end up taken the med. I had been told when I started them that I would just tapper off over a few weeks. Wow,years later. When I had told my Doctor about all the anxiety and other withdrawl symptoms he said I was just going to have to stay on them.....forever.that was not ok with me. Anyway just know I think I have read a few blogs from people at another site that had no problems getting off. Most were like me though so if you are reading up on theis drug before you take it you have been warned it is not fun at all getting off this.If you think how bad could it be, well if you think you are depressed now plus worse things and feelings. good luck

This situation is becoming unbearable and it is like that with every anti-depressant I have tried in this group does the same thing.  I am also on doxepin and remeron, they do not cause this.  I quit taking Effexor for 3 months and the hot spells completely stopped.  But then I was crying all the time and the depression had really set in.  I saw no purpose for anything.  I obviously was born with clinical depression.  The doxepin 50 mg. and the remeron 30 mg. did not seem to help, except with sleep. So, I started back on the Effexor 150mg. and in a few weeks all was fine, except the hot spells.  I am not getting enough exersize because of this and I am a very active person, or was.

After a month with no change, the Dr increased it to the maximum manufacturer's dosage (I was 95 lbs).  The depression lifted like magic and I felt alive again. The Dr insisted I remain on this med at this high dose and after 2 1/2 yrs my weight gain of 50 lbs...!!! became a depression in itself, had drawers and a closet full of clothes I couldn't fit into anymore. I was horrified. This med made me CRAVE food and especially sweets..and I'm not by nature a sweet eater.  I changed Drs in July 2000 and he was surprised at the large dose I was on, took me off of it completely.  My experience was that it worked, it had several side effects as they all do, but the huge dose for the extended time was detrimental in the long run.

There were many stories from people that scared me.  I told my Dr. about them and of course he said, ""yeah, there are many skeptics out there ESPECIALLY on the web.""  Well, he was right.
The drug has been very effective.  I gradually built up to 150mg.  In the past I've taken lexapro (effective also, but gained weight) and wellbutrin (totally ineffective, lost weight).  This drug is a very happy medium. It's effective and I haven't gained weight.  I'm extremely satisfied with the results.  I feel a lot more stable, my anxiety has gone WAY WAY down, and overall I am really back to being myself. I started feeling the effects of it about 3 weeks into taking it.  
My purpose of writing is really to say - everyone has their own experience with these drugs.  You may need to try a few.  The most important thing is to, when coming off, speak with your doctor and do it slowly - you should have a problem, really."

To get off of these with mild withdrawls, I had to break open the capsuls and SLOWLY start to decrease the amount inside. I took away about 1/4 and took 3/4 of the beads for a week or two, then brought it down to a half, then down to 1/2 of a 1/2, then to just however many would stick to a couple finger tips full, took about 6 weeks to wean myself off.

I could never figure out why I was always feeling tired so I decided to start weening myself off the medication for 4 weeks I have been down to 1 pill, side effects I'm not as tired and not yawning, not feeling dizzy but I do have a headache.

I recommend doctors to go straight to this medication.  I also recommend getting th patient off sleep-aids if they are on them, asap! The reason is sandoz-buproprion or trazadone or panaxil etc. tends to be the culprit for the bad side-effects.  The patient needs to sleep, but might feel miserable and totally ineffective on them. As soon as they can sleep four hours or more regularly on their own, they need to get off the sleep-aids so they can see the effects of Effexor -XR working faster.  I have taken up to 262.5mg for over a year. There is not any problem with a higher suggested does as long as the patient is monitored every week in the increase phases. Even two times a week if they are a high risk patient.  Effexor is freedom that I haven't felt in years and I would not be here without it.  If you need it, take it!  If you had a malignant tumor, remove it! Same thing. Get proactive, take care of your depression, and get on with a normal happy life! Good Luck to you in your journey.

I have spoken with a few people about it and I might have to go to an actual detox facility if I want to get off of it all together. I have had issues with my insurance not wanting to cover this medicine and it has been a hassle since I started taking it.  If it didn't treat my depression at the same time I would not take it.

At this higher dose it is also effective for treating anxiety and OCD. Once the initial side effects have been resolved, which I found to be quite tolerable, the drug works well. It is very important to take this drug as directed. Missing a dose has unpleasant side effects. Missing 2 or more doses causes extreme negative side effects that are physically and mentally noticable. The key here is follow your Dr's direction for taking this drug to the letter and never self reduce without his/her approval. The drug is highly effective when taken as directed.

All of this I dealt with for the 1 1/2 years that I was on Effexor, but I feel compelled to tell my story of trying to ease off of the drug. I found the experience terrifying. I became instantly sad and angry. I also had ""brain zaps"" as I called them for several weeks. I could feel electrical shocks in my brain and legs and feet. I also had this strange sensation of being able to hear very loudly and feel my eyes moving. It all sounds silly, but was very scarey at the time.

There is no other way to describe it.  I am afraid to come off it, but the withdrawal symptoms scare me so much I have started to ween myself down.  I feel like I am addicted to it.

Be sure and really quiz your doctor about all the medications and ask him or her why they feel a particular anti depressant is the one that they want to get you started on. Talk to others what has worked for them and go on line and get as much info as you can. One spcialist told me that he felt Effexor worked particulary well for women.

972$Condition: Depression$2/17/2009 12:56:14 PM$Reviewer: ANGELA,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$1$4$In the short term, Effexor XR was very effective in treating my depression and anxiety.  However, after being on this med for 8 months, I gained 35-40 lbs! The weight gain was not immediate, it just sneaks up on you.  There was abolutely no weight gain for the first 3 months or so, but then I noticed gaining a few pounds here and there and my clothes became tighter.  Even though I had not changed my eating habits at all, I was gaining weight!  I went from a size 8 to a size 12.  At that point, Effexor became counter-productive for me since the weight gain really depressed me.  I went off of it last week (cold turkey) and I've lost 4 lbs.  Luckily, I've had no withdrawal symptoms (even though you are not supposed to go cold turkey).  In summary, I guess for the short term (3 months or less), Effexor XR is great, but I would never EVER take it longer than that due to the weight gain.

The Effexor got me out of a hell hole. But for the last year, I have been experiencing advancing blurriness, aggitation and finally jaundice. Because of my moods going up and down, I thought and also my psychiatrist thought that I was bipolar so he put me on Lamictal.I couldn't tolerate this med. because it caused severe joint pain. I had blood work checked last March and the results were all normal except for my cholesterol and triglycerides were  elevated. These are side effects of Effexor XR. I wish I had read all this information when all the symptoms started happening to my body. I should have gone on the computer and read all the side effects instead of being naive. I questioned my psychiatrist and he thought that I was rationalizing too much between an elevated blood pressure and an increase with my aggitation. (Jee, I am not bipolar after all). I guess I was right and he was definately wrong. Even though we have ""mental issues"", we should take all the changes in our behavior seriously after we are put on these medications. Our chemical imbalances lead us to take these chemicals. I have been off the med for almost 2 weeks after cutting myself down (I work in a doctor's office) and the main withdrawal was dizziness and I had to really concentrate on what I was saying. I feel great right now, no depression or anxiety. I hope and pray I remain this way and I hope that everyone pays attention to each and every day while on this med. Keep a diary. "

I had to stop taking it once I realized it was causing my violent dreams.  The very real problem with the violent dreams is that I was acting them out in my sleep.  This resulted in my hitting and kicking my wife in bed, and then throwing myself out of my bed resulting in back surgery after one episode, and neck rehab after another.  The dream side effects can be very dangerous!  I have tried several other antidepressants, resulting in other side effects, none have included the violent dreams.  Anafril still involved acting out my dreams, but they were not nearly as violent.  Luvox does not seem to control the anger, so I am trying Lexapro next.

It was the only thing that helped me to get off of it and not suffer the extreme withdrawal symptoms. It took me about 3 weeks to ween off. I am back on it again, though. It seems to work. Same as many others- very bizarre dreams! Can be very funny. No nightmares, though. Sometimes, lack of energy. Definitely lack of desire, but not lack of ability to have sex. I have noticed memory issues, but not sure it's related to this drug or Ambien.
995$Condition: Depression$2/2/2009 10:07:21 PM$Reviewer: big momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$1$2$After taking first Zoloft for a long period of time I switched to Celexa because of the lack of sex drive. I recently began taking the generic Effexor when the Celexa seemed to stop working. There were a lot of side effects initially which eventually went away and the antidepressant seemed to be working. I've recently been having problems with exessive fatigue ( after a full nights sleep, I can still sleep all day and have fallen asleep mid sentence sitting on the couch!)I've begun to suspect the Effexor may be the cause of this because I see no other reason for this constant tiredness and have not had this problem before. However, I had no idea that the withdrawls lasted so long so I am afraid to discontinue use. I am the only person at home with my three young children and I have an idea what I am in for because I have forgotten a dose before and the dizziness and heart palpitations were awful and appeared very randomly. I wouldn't recommend this medication if you have any other choices.

Yet It has become more difficult then one can imagine. Night sweats, terribile nightmares, dizzy spells, overall lack of energy are a few things to name from its nasty withdrawl. Although Effexor stabely helped my depression the withdrawl is just not worth it. Even If I missed one dose in the morning I begin to feel sick within 12 hours. Do not even begin to take this drun unless you have tried everything.

For the first 2 years or so, it helped. I was able to leave the house and do the things I used to do with ease. Then things started to change. 

Now I constantly have nausea, insomnia, tremors, brain zaps, vertigo (dizziness) and mood swings. I take it every other day, and I still have the same result. It has effected my job, I have more panic attacks, I am slowly starting to not be able to leave the house, and I seem to be more irritable after its been in my system. After I take it, I am miserable the whole day. I can't eat, sleep, function, I feel like a zombie.

When I don't take it, I have severe brain zaps, I cry if someone looks at me cross-eyed, I become more violent, and I can't leave the house. Even going to the grocery store makes it worse.

I've tried a wide range of medicine to help relieve some of these symptoms, and so far nothing has worked: Celexa, Paxil, Depakote, Wellbutrin, Gapabentin, Neurontin, Topamax, Klonopin, Seroquel.

Mind you, I was around 17-18 during the time that I was taking all these, so it could have been my age, and maybe the fact that I had raging hormones and ""nothing worked"". 

I don't have health insurance, so it's been quite hard for me to change medications, so I've stuck to this medication. Why? I have no idea. All I do know is that I need to get on something different. It doesn't seem to help me anymore, only make things worse. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. It would really help me out a lot. I just want my life back."

Severe dizziness, heart flutters, feelings of passing out brain zaps. Within an hour of taking the next dose, the symptoms stop but it is very scary. I found a website where other users state they have all had withdrawl symptoms also.  I do wish my doctor would have advised me of this prior to my using this medication. The information from the pharmacy does not say anything either. I have tried other brands that also helped my depression and not had these symptoms.

I felt cured, but had to take it because of tremendous physical withdrawl.standard reduction not tolerable. So I did it my own way, zoloft was cheaper. I continued my Rx of Effexor as ordered & started zoloft at 25mg.(sort of did it like a starter pack). As I increased the Zoloft, I decreased the Effexor. Took me about 2 wks just listening to my body & emotions.Had to go for 150mg of zoloft initially & now have been able to decrease that without the nasty withdrawls. I started Effexor cause I was a mess & the Zoloft just wouldnt cut it at first. I have improved my ways through counseling & feel better, but initially I do believe the Effexor was a much need lifesaver. I have noticed a little less 'drive/motivation' since switching meds but for now I've got a handle on it. I prefer Effexor XR--bless the day it ever goes generic!

1024$Condition: Depression$1/16/2009 8:00:54 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $2$2$5$It is an easy drug to use, just swallow it once a day. I have been on it for 12 years. I've tried to self wean myself off of it but can't.  The original prescribing doctor left the state six months after putting me on it but said it would only take a year for me to stablize emotionally and be taken off of it. Since going on it I have been diagnosed with Disassociative Personality Disorder; I have also become an alcoholic. When I told my doctor how much I drank, he told me I really shouldn't do that any more. I am suicidal but benefit from the personality disorder since part of me remains the caretaker of human beings and animals and birds that I have been for my whole life. My brother shot his rifle at me because I had refused to let him molest me at less than 9 years of age, my father both sexually assualted and abused me at an early age and also told me that I should have been killed as a defective being; my mother told me from an early age that as the second born twin I would have been killed at birth had I been born in Africa. (note: I'm not African). I thought Effexor RX would help me get through a difficult stage as a government whistle blower. Instead I am addicted to it and lorazapan and alcohol. If I didn't have the ability and opportunity to care for beings and creatures less fortunate, I would have left this world.  No, I don't think any medicene that requires taking it for 12 years and with no end in sight is good. Treating a symptom does not treat the person or the cause.  And anyone on these meds should realize that most medical studies only look at the complications of usage for 6 months or less. The analytical side of me tells me that there is something very wrong in an advanced society that perpetuates drug usage rather than helping individuals to overcome emotional trauma.

I became depressed early in High School when I underwent extensive back surgery and my parents got a divorce. These two events happened simultaneously, and my father falsely blamed me for the divorce. This led to my severe depression and self-hatred. I convinced my father to let me talk to my General Practitioner about depression, because he doesn't believe in ""Shrinks."" After trying many other antidepressants (Prozac, Lexapro, Elavil, and others), my GP decided to start me on Effexor. I was 15 years old at the time. I was not made aware of the drug's short half-life, nor was I told of the extreme dependence I would develop. I have been taking a very high dose (300mg daily) since I began the drug, and I absolutely hate it. As far as my depression symptoms go, this drug has been very effective in controlling them. However, if I miss just one dose, I suffer extreme ""brain shocks,"" dizziness, chills, shaking, and other withdrawal symptoms. I have talked with my GP about stopping this drug, but she will not assist me with it, because she believes I need to take it at least until I graduate from college. I am currently searching for a Psychiatrist who will understand this drug more thoroughly and who will help me break my addiction. I do not want to live my life dependent on a drug, and I wish I had never begun taking Effexor. Please consider VERY carefully the side effects and the dependence-causing qualities of this drug before you agree to take it. Also, be sure your doctor fully understands your condition. If you are suffering from a mental illness, speak to a Psychiatrist or Mental Therapist, not just your Family Doctor or General Practitioner. This medication is highly habit-forming. Please beware."

My experience with Effexor has been the worst. I had been taking 150mg for about 3 months and felt better. The depression ""broke through"" again and my doc increased the dose to 300mg. I began to experience terrible side-effects: headaches, irritability and even though I do not drink alcohol I felt hung-over every morning. Called the doctor and started cutting back the dosage over a few weeks. Now that I am not taking the drug at all I am miserable. I cannot sleep at night, I feel anxious, I'm experiencing what others have described as ""brain shivers"" and I just feel like my brain is not working properly. I'm having a lot of short-term memory problems too. It's the worst withdrawal I've ever experienced. 

I wish I had learned more about this drug before I began taking it. Any benefit I had during the first 3 months do not outweigh the side-effects and horrible withdrawal. This is a drug of last resort. Use with caution."

I saw my OB and he allowed me to wean myself off of the medication, but my life was a living hell for about a month.  Fortunately I was finally off of it totally and my baby (now 2) is happy and healthy.  I am on celexa now, which works as good or better than the effexor.

My experience was that it was not very effective for treating the symptoms of depression, and once I made the decision with my doctor to discontinue use, the side effects of withdrawal were absolutely unbearable. It took almost a year to come off the drug with very small reductions in dosage because any larger reductions caused me to not be able to function properly. Even going from the smallest available dose (37.5 mg) to nothing was almost impossible - I had to break the capsules apart and count out the little pellets inside to make smaller reductions in dose. The doctor's suggestion to take 37.5 mg every other day was not helpful - it just meant that the ""day off"" was terrible. Please, please consider the severe side effects of this drug before using it. It may be able to help you, but if it doesn't, you will pay a very high price for taking it."

My doctor had me on this medication for over 7 years and he told me that I shouldn't stay on this medication for over 2 years but couldn't get off because of bad side effects that kept me on taking it. When I finally got off of this horable medication I had severe withdraws, migraine headaches, saw things that was not there, body shook for 30 days (including with the 30 days of seeing things that was not there & headaches). Everytime I would move my body and head I would get a ""shock"" that would go up to the top of my head like it was an electrical shock. I felt as if my brain was moving. Sounds scarey, you should feel it to experience it. How can any company make this pill for any human being is just cruel. I think if the doctors would take this pill for 1 month and get off of the pill they would not recommend this pill for nobody! This pill is the most physical addicting pill I have ever been on and highly recommend that no one to take this pill. It made me have sucidial thoughts and actually did overdose and was put in rehab different times over this medication. I went off this pill with out my doctor's permission because I didn't want this in my system anymore. I feel so much better now then when I was taking that medication. I have been off Effexor for now over 2 years. Thank God for taking this in my own hands and getting off this nasty medication. Xanax is much better for me and I only take it when I need it not like the Effexor. Plus I have no side effects with Xanax.

The side effects of Effexor varied with the dosage. Some side effects went away at higher doses, and some side effects were worse at higher doses.
The highest dose I used was 375mg, and at that level I lost my ability to concentrate on anything.
Now I take a 150mg dose/ day and have little or no side effects, but see no benefits as far as depression or anxiety symptoms.

From the very beginning The medication did exactly what it's supposed to do. I started out taking the Effexor XR at a very low dose and was ""built up"" to the 150 mg a day,that I've taken for so long. About 4 years ago the medication was increased to 150 mg Am & 150 mg PM. About 1 year ago I noticed that the medication didn't seem to be working as effectively as it always had. So, about 8 months ago, my Dr added Wellbutrin SR 150 mg to my medications. I don't take the wellbutrin every day, just on those days that I feel is gonna be a really bad day. On those days I take 150 mg Effexor XR & 150 mg Wellbutrin SR AM and if I feel that I need it I take it the same way at night, before I go to bed. Over all The medication has worked very well for me."

1056$Condition: Depression$12/27/2008 1:53:29 AM$Reviewer: wagirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$4$"I started taking Effexor 2 years ago to treat severe depression and anxiety with heart palpitations.  My doc also put me on atenolol to control the palpitations, which is a nice combo because it reduces your blood pressure and prevents migraines.    After a year I felt better, like many of you who complained about wanting to get off it, and slowly tapered off.  What I have learned in the last year of horrible depression trying to do it ""on my own"" with diet, exercise, counseling, and the atenolol - is that going off was a horrible mistake.  I was feeling better BECAUSE of the Effexor XR.  I stopped working out, gardening, doing the things I love this year.  I am now back on it and committed to staying on it for at least two years straight this time.  I had tried Prozac, Celexa, Wellbutrin before with limited results on my depression and increased anxiety.  Effexor XR is the only one that has really helped both my depression and anxiety at the same time.  Within 24 hrs of starting it again, I already feel calmer, happier, more hopeful and at peace.  Life seems worth living and I am thankful for everyone in my life again too instead of ready to walk away from them all, lock myself in a hotel room, and cry for a few months like I was before I started it again.  Yes, decreased libido, difficulty achieving orgasm, don't drink more than one alcoholic drink or you will be sick and have the worst migraines and nausea ever, vivid dreams and some difficulty sleeping.  Overall, it has definitely been worth it. Definitely not a ""starter"" antidepressant, but it can be very effective when others don't work for you.  I recommend the XR version over the others to reduce side effects.  I am a therapist myself and sometimes people have biological causes of depressions that need something strong like this.  Commit to taking this one if you need it, and withdraw VERY slowly.  It can save lives.  It did mine."

I started at a 37.5 dose, and was escalated to the 75 dose. I have been on Effexor for a little less than a year, and am terrified to ever go off, as even when I dont take my medication at the same time each day, it is a miserable reaction. The 'dizzies', as I like to call them, are by far one of the worst feelings I have ever experienced within a medication. They are so severe that it feels as though the room is jerking left to right. My advice: Take this medication close to the same time each day - and good luck to us all if anyone ever have to go off this medication.

However, taking it in the evening after dinner (instructed to take with food), I found several initial side effects; nausea, frequent urination, trouble sleeping, diarrhea. A few months ago I stopped a three month course of Cipralex because of side effects. Most troubling is the anecdotes refering to the withdrawal symptoms. It may be that having suffered almost lifelong melencholia, I should prepare myself to stay on one medication or another to improve my mood, but I'm concerned that the side effects and withdrawal, (should I chooose to stop) are not worth it. Currently I am experiencing a serious bout of 'situational' depression, (illness of my son), and this problem is long term and has little chance of resolving. Can an anti-depressant, such as Effexor, be helpful in dealing with this problem?

1101$Condition: Depression$11/24/2008 9:05:16 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$2$3$"This drug worked great (much better than other antidepressants) for me for a few years, then the good effects seemed to wear off.  Sexual side effects were awful also.

Also, this is not a scientific claim at all, but I and others have noticed that it seems to make you smoke a LOT more (if you smoke already)- I tried another bout w/ this drug recently and it didn't work how it did the first time - still made me smoke like a fiend though, and maybe even made me crave alcohol more, too.  

This drug is VERY hard to get off of.  I had the ""brain shivers"" for several MONTHS after reaching a 0 dose after tapering down off of it as slowly as possible. 

Looking back on this drug, considering its withdrawal symptoms and the fact that it didn't feel the same when I ""retried"" it is that I sort of felt/feel nervous that it changed my brain or something.  I feel like I am not nearly as smart/quick as I was before I ever took it.  I can't say that this drug caused that, but it seems to be the determining factor.  

So, I would say that anyone should be careful taking this drug b/c it is very powerful.  It can help a lot, but it is very easy to become dependent on, and might end up changing you.  It's not a good first choice for folks who just need ""a little help getting through the holidays"" or need a little help after a bad event.  It is more appropriate (in my opinion) for someone willing and able to continue w/ it (if it works well) for chronic/serious depression.

I had to quit almost immediately after starting treatment. Apparently, side effects are relatively rare with this medication, but I got it all and then some...Couldn't sleep, constantly clenching and grinding teeth, shaking, crying, severely dilated pupils to the point where my eyes hurt and I couldn't see. Takes about a month for the meds to work, but only eight hours to get the side effects. I understand it works for a lot of people, but obviously not me. I'm on zoloft now and that is working much better for me.

Effexor has worked the best of any drug I have tried in regards to Depression and Panic treatment. I am now up to 225mg per day, and I think I found my correct dosage. It has been months since I have experienced any panic attacks, and severe depression bouts are virtually gone as well. If you have started this medication, be sure to converse with your doctor frequently to find the dose that is best for you. Also, this is an SNRI drug- which means it works for serotonin and norepinephran- but, the benefits of norepinephran cannot be seen at a low dose; if you stop increasing at an early stage, you may as well be taking an ordinary SSRI like Zoloft, etc.

When I got close to being able to come down off, I took it each day but only when I remembered I forgot to take it. I have finally downgraded myself to 37.5 mg on the next 2 weeks.

Before I was put on this, I was a complete mess-- attempting sucicide frequently, self-injuring to the point of needing stitches regularly, starving myself, multiple hospitalizations. During my very last hospitalization over a year ago, I was taken off all of my meds (high doses of Abilify, Seroquel, Lamictal, Trazadone, Prozac, Lithium, and Inderal) and put on Effexor. I do not remember the early days on Effexor (that period is kind of blurry, and I was withdrawing from the other medications), but I have been on Effexor ever since. I have had one dose increase, but now at 225 mg, I am doing amazing. I realize the poteniality of life and the little wonders each person has inside.

Before deciding to finally treat my depression and hopefully get rid of it once and for all, I tried Paxil with limited response.  In addition to my 150mg a day dose of Effexor XR, I do talk therapy once a week and try to exercise about three times a week.  I haven't noticed any adverse effects but I am diligent about taking it in the morning and also working out and not emotional overeating.  I totally understand that some people have had bad experiences with the drug; however, for me it does work and that is just something to keep in mind.  I actually feel like myself and am out enjoying things that I did before my depression took over.

Well, I ran out before I could refill(mail order), and my monthly appt. was just a week away so I decided to hold off til then, hoping to get a cheaper(generic) form.
BAD DECISION! 
Now 5 days into cold turkey and I am totally exhausted! My husband has had to wake me up out of horrible, fitful nightmares 4/5 of those nights, some only to continue when I fall asleep again. Mornings~ my body is sore from my minds' activities; running from..., inability to scream, though vocal(he says), flailing of arms and legs, night sweats, and just total mind and body exhaustion from the night's events. I have just left a message with my GP, after finding these posts, to see if he can help me to detox from this OR modify my rx.  My pain mgt. doctor doesn't like prescribing antidepressants anyway, nor did he even remember doing so, although he has been doing so for 3 yrs. 
I feel I should've been warned about these sorts of things happening, tho I do know that cold turkey isn't usually the right way to get off any medication. "

I got very I'll  vomiting Dizziness, headachs, I could not see or move, without getting sick. I called the drug co. myself and told them  what was going on, I asked how long these symptoms would last, they did not know. after many trips to the DR. and hospitals I was told that my so called panic attacks wern't panic they were mini siezures. any way I stayed off the meds and it was pure Hell for about 2 or 3 months. one thing that did help ease the dizziness ,vomiting ect... was the hospital gave me a script for motion sickness, I don't remember the name but you can ask your DR. I don't know what it feels like to be an addict of heroine but I watched someone very close to me come off of it and in my opinion effexor is an addiction just as bad, the only difference is your not aware of what your your about to put yourself through. I 'm off about 3 years now, I have my up and downs and during my downs I remember what effexor did to me and I continue Drug free. I wish you all well and I pray this gives you enough info for you to say no to effexor.

They did NOTHING I was just really sad, and sleepy (not good with a new baby)I tried all sorts of things to make me feel a bit better, including exercise, acupuncture, herbal mixtures, smoking, counseling.  I think that Effexor was new on the market at the time and my Doc asked if I would like to give it a try which was about 10 years ago when my 1st child was nearly two, I couldn't believe the difference. I FINALLY felt 'alive' again, unfortunately when I fell pregnant with my 2nd one in 1998 the Doc took me off and put me on some other drug. I had terrible neck pain and low blood pressure - I even gave up smoking I felt so ill. When she was born I went straight back on the Effexor and have been on them ever since. In 2002 I had got myself down to 37.2mg and doing alot of exercise I never felt any withdrawal side effects. I then hit a 'BIG WALL' in my life and had to get the dose put back up, but then baby #3 decided to come along, Doc said stay on my Effexor since I'd been on it for so long - he didn't like my side effects from last pregnancy either.
I am currently on 150mg which I take every morning. If I don't take it by 1pm my fingertips go all tingly and funny and I soon remember, the longest that I have gone without is three days and I didn't know that I had forgotten them. 
Over the years my doses have varied, alot has to do with what's happening in my life.
I have been on these with drinking alcohol, and that was not too good, I now just have them every day and I find that even though life's little tests can make me feel like it is all up and down, I know that the Effexor is keeping me on an even keel and I believe that I am staying pretty level in my day to day feelings, and not going to extremes, as I had previously experienced.
I hope this review helps someone else, as I believe that you can't just 'solve' depression/anxiety in a few months."

I have no sex drive anymore and am also constipated. My doctor suggested cutting my 150mg down to 75mg. That only lasted about a week until I went back to the 150mg. I can't afford to taper down as I can not function properly at work. This must be what it is like to be addicted to crack...NO WAY OUT!

However, she has lost feelings for loved ones, stating that she has no feeling for us. She also suffers from several of the negative side effects (headaches, bladder problems, chills/hot flashes, muscular twitching, rash, and anxiety). Due to the influence of this drug she refuses to listen to my sugestion that she see her Doctor about trying a different medication. I strongly do not recommend this drug.

1159$Condition: Depression$10/20/2008 2:12:58 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"To those saying Effexor should be removed from the market, let's be fair - different meds work in different ways for different people. It is your (along with your doctor's) responsibility to research new medications before starting to put them into your body. My doctor warned me about the side effects and let me make the decision to try Effexor to determine if the benefits outweigh the detriments. I have experienced increased sweating (I knew that to be a possible side effect) as well as the withdrawal symptoms many have described (""electrical storm in the head"", dizziness, etc.) but luckily, I knew what to expect and the effects were manageable. It is absolutely IMPERATIVE that you discuss ramping the dosage up/down when you start/stop Effexor XR. If your health care provider does not mention the possible withdrawal symptoms associated with missing a dosage or stopping Effexor ""cold turkey"", they do not know enough about this medication to be prescribing it. If this medication does not work for you (give it 6-10 weeks for full effect), taper the dosage and get off - try something else. I only remain on Effexor because it works to manage my depression. As common sense would indicate, do not stay on this medication if the benefits do not outweigh the side effects. The withdrawal symptoms will be worse than any of the side effects you experience on Effexor, but they ARE temporary (so far as we know) and will go away after ~ one week. I have been on and off different dosages for years and can tell you that it's not a drug to put in your body unless you are aware of and understand the potential undesired effects."

If I had a flare up, and slept for too long, therefore not taking my pill at the exact time every day, I had horrible mood swings that became progressively more violent, and I could not control them, even knowing that I was being outrageous. I had terrible headaches that rendered me useless at times. I felt suicidal, and it became increasingly worse. I became paranoid, and developed sleeping problems. Trying to come off of this dangerous drug was an equally terrifying experience. I was told that I couldn't start a different drug in the same ""category"" because of what these drugs-pain relieving antidepressants-are made of. And I just had to fight my way through it, tapering off from 300 mgs. daily. Luckily, a doctor prescribed depakote, and that has helped. 3 people in my family have been prescribed effexor at varying dosages through the years, from 37.5 mgs, to my 300 mgs., and not a single one of them has had a good thing to say about the experience. I would strongly recommend, if someone's dr prescribes them effexor, say NO and find a new dr."

I often experienced nightmares, sleeplessness borderlining on insomnia, and inability to achieve orgasm.  In addition to this, I do NOT like the idea of possibly having to increase my dosage, making me even more dependant on a drug that I personally do not believe was necessary in the first place.  I have missed doses in the past, and experience even worse side-effects, i.e. these 'electric shocks' that everyone seems to mention, strong mood swings, and even worse cases of insomnia.  Noting this only helps reinforce my decision to stop taking this medication, as the side effects will eventually cease...the only question being - how long?  I last took this medication 48 hours ago, and the electric shock feeling is the worst of the bunch.

These changes in mood were rapid and unexplainable...also felt hungry but threw up most everything I ate. I was tired and weak all the time and had disturbingly vivid dreams...it was enough to keep me from trying it again once I got insurance through my job.

The body aches, sweating, twitching and SEVERE Muscle spasms lasted for about 4 weeks.  The muscle spasms STARTED after about two weeks of being off medication.  That was actually the worst of all.  I was taking Clonazapam to help with that, which it did.  Again, I just need for people to know that all the terrible withdrawal symptoms will end.  Don't start taking them again just because you can't take it.  TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR about what you can do and take to ease these symptoms.

I had slight improvement in depression.  Had to go off of it because I wanted to get pregnant.  There are no words to describe the horrors of withdrawal.  It is horrendous.  I felt like I had the worst flu imaginable for 6 weeks.  And I went off of it very slowly for the 4 weeks prior to that.  I was vomiting, had vertigo, fever, exhausted, achy, literally unable to move a muscle without serious pain.  What saved me was that I got hold of a few non XR tablets of Effexor and I would take a very small bite (probably 5 mgs?) of it when I felt horrible.  That relieved my withdrawal for a few hours usually.  They don't make non XR anymore as far as I know but I would also call up the toll free Effexor line and scream at them whenever possible.  I would suggest that the company make the non-XR for this reason.

My brain has felt like it has been in a fog the entire time. I get headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, extremely blurry vision and I just feel numb. However, knowing I will be off this in 3 weeks gives me hope. I was prescribed effexor for depression and GAD. I think effexor should only be prescribed for severe cases. The side effects have been awful and your body goes into withdrawal even if you're late. I would say if your symptoms are not life-threatening (yourself or others)try something else!

This drug is not worth it!!!  I am in the process of quitting Effexor after about 1 year. While it did help at first with my depression and anxiety the withdrawal process is horrible! I did not receive any information about addiction/withdrawal from my doctor, pharmacist or the medication guide. According to the Effexor website this drug is not addictive - totally false! When I talked to my doctor about the lightheadedness I experienced each day as I would get close to the time to take the pills, she just said ""oh that's odd you are so sensitive to it"" and recommended that I take the pills at a different time. I also experienced extreme sleepiness daily. After slowly cutting down my dose over the last month I have now been off Effexor for 3 days. I am ok as long as I don't move my head or eyes which is impossible. I have a feeling somewhere between sea-sickness and electric shocks running through my brain. Combined with muscle aches and tension, nausea, insomnia and spontaneous crying I am not functional at this point. A nurse at my health provider told me today to expect these withdrawal symptoms to last at least one week. This experience has more than undone any good that Effexor has done for me. I am glad that the drug has helped some people, but i feel that it should be taken off the market. I'm afraid that what I'm experiencing now may be causing some damage to my brain that will come back to haunt me later. Although i have been diagnosed as dysthymic with several episodes of major depression since childhood, I am through with anti-depressants and all prescription drugs for now. My doctor had recommended that I try Cymbalta after getting off Effexor, but it reportedly also has strong withdrawal symptoms for many people. I don't want to go through this again. Don't risk your mental and physical health with Effexor!"
1211$Condition: Depression$9/27/2008 1:15:06 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$3$Good and bad experiences with Effexor. I was on this drug for about 2 yrs. I was on 75mg for one year and 150 the 2nd. It immediately helped with the depression/anxiety. It did affect my sleep, made me able to sleep an abnormal amount. Also, after waking I could wave my hand in front of my face and experience tracers, sometimes more intense than other times. One summer I went home from college and ran out of meds, withdrawal symptoms were intense!  Intense restlessness, weird vision, odd dizziness, mood swings, etc.  Mostly made my head feel strangely terrible and unlike it ever had before.  Resumed meds and returned to normal.  Now, I have been coming off the meds and have just fully come off them.  Withdrawal symptoms have been weird feeling in head, intense moods, lots of crying at one point, and now have been experiencing some stabbing pains in my torso that I am pretty sure have to do with the changes in meds. BASICALLY, this med can help but coming off is difficult and will make you experience things you never have before. Every person experiences it differently and lucky for me I think my case was not too bad.  Doctors should be educating their patients more thoroughly about this drug and it's effects.  This is a drug for mental conditions, and treating such a thing should not be treated lightly.  These are our lives we are dealing with.  Patients have the right to know more about what we are taking.

I have been trying to keep my posts up to date on when certain things are happening as well as how long they last in the hopes of helping others out there like YOU!  Talk to your doctor about maybe something for anxiety to help with some of your symptoms.  The stomach issues lasted less than a week.  Take Pepto Bismo or something like that to help ease that part.  I was just given Clonazapam, which has helped a lot with my twitching and muscle spasms.  It also helped me to actually get some sleep.  We are all here for you, OK?  If you have any other questions, ask it here and i will keep checking back.

Let me first say: It DOES work. My depression and especially my anxiety have been non-existent while taking. However, the withdrawal symptoms are THE WORSE EVER. Even if I was late taking a dose (I usually take in the morning) by the afternoon, I would be nauseus, BRAIN ZAPS, headache, and very weak. When I take my meds, it goes away. I hate what this has done to me. I think this drug really needs to be taken off the market. It may work for depression and anxiety but the price you pay is not worth it. There are  other ways to deal with depression and others meds that don't cause such horrible side effects. I've gained 30lbs in 8 mos. I just talked to my DR. 2 days ago and he's starting me on a plan to start weaning off. I am so scared because I've read the horror withdrawal stories. But I am so desperate to get off this drug, that I'm willing to deal with the symptoms. If you are thinking about taking this drug: DON'T DO IT!!!

I hope this will be useful for others going through that hell.  Just returned from the doctor about my SEVERE muscle spasms.  I MEAN SEVERE!!!!  They started two days ago.  You can't sleep.  It HURTS!!!!!  :/  He put me on Clonazapam to ease that and said I may have to endure another week of this.  The headaches are going away.  I am no longer sick to my stomach all the time.  Sweating has eased up a lot.  AllI can say is, if you are trying to stop taking this medication, you will need to endure some awful side effects.  DO NOT GIVE IN and start taking them again.  It will be hard, but it will end.

I hope and pray someone will find some confort with this information.  Again, you are not alone and it WILL go away.  I will post again once I am ME again.  I just wish this information was available when I first tried to get off it!!!!

I went from 120 pounds to almost 160 in a very short time frame.  THAT made me more depressed.  I was not eating a lot.  So while the medication did help make me feel better and ease my anxiety attacks, I did suffer from weight gain and dry mouth.  Due to losing my job, no insurance and no money, I have been OFF Effexor XR for 10 days now.  THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE!!!!.  My Doctor DID NOT tell me about the side effects of coming off Effxor XR.  I have been throwing up constantly, dizzy all the time, flu like symptoms, can't sleep, severe body aches.........  It is amazing how horrible the withdrawal symptoms are.  I just want others to know that they are NOT CRAZY and are NOT ALONE.  I have been trying to find out how long this will last to no avail.

Just sprinkle it on applesauce, but don't crunch or chew. I've been on approx. 25 mg. for about 5 days now. Getting ready to lower that even more. The side effects are not nearly as bad.

I've read up the reviews on most antidepressants & can see that almost everyone experiences side-effects & withdrawal symptoms - some none, some mild, & others severe. They say ""No pain no gain.""
Doctors aren't know-all, so it's best if one does some research on their own & not rely fully on their doctor for info. 
One has to weigh the pros. & cons. of taking a drug themselves, not getting discouraged by others' unpleasant experiences. For example, before taking Effexor, I was sad 24/7. I would curl up in bed whole day, re-playing hurtful & unpleasant memories from past,& getting so worked up over them (angry/sad) all over again. I kept thinking of all sorts of sad things & just cried & cried. I wanted my husband to stay with me all the time; I was so demanding. I didn't want to go out or do anything. My world was so dark & gloomy. I even got suicidal, thinking of quick & painless ways to die. Everything seemed hopeless, like I was never going to get better, ever. I just wanted to die. Or I believed I was seriously going insane. Now, although Effexor mostly makes me so drowsy & fatigued & causes some other inconveniences, I'd rather suffer from these for a while than go back to the miserable & horrifying state I was in, which was a whole lot more difficult for others to deal with.
One last thing, if you can afford it, try counseling by a psychologist. It sped up my recovery by miles."

It's true as some said that doctors don't seem very informed about the full scope of side-effects of this drug, or they hesitate to tell because they're afraid to scare off the patients.:) My doctor only told me about having dry mouth & sweating more, but you probably agree that those are the least of concerns. I did look up more on all possible side-effects on the net; was shocked at how bad they can be, but since the med. did help me feel better mentally & emotionally (coupled with psychotherapy), I didn't bother trying to see how I'd do on other drugs. Doctor increased my dose slowly,& I experienced almost all the side-effects, particularly extreme drowsiness & fatigue. Now my dose is very slowly being reduced; had some mild withdrawal symptoms for about 10 days, & feeling so much better (less sleepy & tired) afterwards. Now on 112.5mg & things seem to be going pretty well. Good med. in general for me. Personally, I don't mind the withdrawal symptoms, though severe, as long as I can get rid of depression, which is a more serious concern to me & debilitate me more in all sense than any side-effects/ withdrawal symptoms, which are mainly physical.

1271$Condition: Depression$8/19/2008 8:39:52 AM$Reviewer: alb, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have worked for several years with my doctor and mental health therapist to find ways to minimize the symptoms of chronic depression with exacerbations of seasonal affective disorder.  After much experimentation we hit on the combination of taking Wellbutrin year-round for the chronic depression and adding Effexor XR in varying doses throughout 9 months of the year to treat the seasonl affective disorder.  
I start taking 37.5 mg of Effexor in the middle of August, increasing to 75 mg at the middle of October and to 112.5 mg at the end of November.  I maintain that dose all winter, until the beginning of April when I begin decreasing the dose at about 3-week intervals so that I'm off the Effexor by the middle of May.
I have tried decreasing the dose more quickly than that, but like many others have reported, the side effects made me very uncomfortable.  (I have learned, when weaning off, to carry one 37.5 mg capsule with me to take if I'm feeling especially uncomfortable, but find I have rarely needed to take it.)
While the medicine has been indispensable in relieving my suffering, I also must report the importance of behavioral interventions – showering and getting dressed every day, getting outside daily (even if it’s just to sit on the porch), calling or visiting friends when I’m feeling down, and seeing my mental health therapist and/or doctor when I’m feeling overwhelmed.  They help me to see how my thoughts may be contributing to the depression and how I can get back on track.
If you are suffering, don’t give up.  Try the interventions your doctor suggests, and let him or her know what works and what doesn’t so that your treatment can be tailored to you.

I just had to wean myself off of it a couple of months ago because my insurance is changing and I can no longer afford it. I did have weird dreams when I first started taking it and I would sweat alot in my sleep. I'm assuming this was caused by the Effexor because I'm no longer having those problems. As far as weight gain, I lost and gained weight on it, so I believe it has no effect on weight. I believe I gained weight by eating lots of fast food and rarely exercising. I do believe it slowed down my weight lost process making it harder to lose weight. I start on Celexa tomorrow and hoping it works as well as Effexor!

Rather than make me feel better, it has made me not feel at all.  I finally realized how much I was missing in life because I could not enjoy things while taking this med, so my doctor is very slowly taking me off of it. 

I have quit taking it before, and because of life circumstances, I was put on it again.  The withdrawal I experienced from this med is unlike anything I ever experienced before.  I got all of the usual things; flu-like symptoms, brain shocks, anger, sadness, hopelessness, and more.  This time I am taking Geodon and Wellbutrin SR to help with the withdrawal.  It has helped quite a bit to take these meds!  I do still have some withdrawal symptoms, but not even close to as much as I had before.

In all, I think that Effexor XR can be very helpful to a depressed person, but  people need to know about the withdrawal BEFORE they start it!"

I am so grateful that my roommate was with me. She was there to calm me and escort me back home. So, in a nutshell, I would say pay close attention to the side affects on this medication because they can pull you out of your element. I hope this helped.

It really helped me. Regretably my doctor never told me that there would be withdrawl symptoms until after I had been on the med. for 2 months. Since it was giving me my life back, I have stayed on it for 2yrs. I never planned on remaining on the drug forever, so after talking with my doctor, I have been ""stepping down"" over the past 2wks. I have 3 days left on 37.5 mg. then I'm done. I've had mild withdrawl symptoms such as fatique ,slight nausea, and lightheadedness.  Most often the symptoms are greatly minimized by late afternoon. Eventhough the med. really helped me get through a horrible time in my life I will be glad to be totally off of it.
I will be all the wiser the next time I am prescribed medication for anything. I will make certain that I am knowledgable of a drugs side effects and potential for dependency before I ever start taking it, no matter how bennificial it may be. Instead of solely trusting the doctor to inform me."

I used to feel too tired and depressed to exercise, and it didn't help me.  It only made me want to eat more, and I gained about 20 lbs over that time period.  I am NOT prone to such weight gain. I've felt a bit better, but that's because my situation has changed and I've moved to a better place.  If I continue to gain weight, I will be really upset.  My clothes don't fit anymore.  I was really scared to stop the drugs, but since I moved I'm no longer on the same health care plan, so I can't see the doctor who prescribed Effexor.  I noticed that I didn't feel any side effects when I was late taking Effexor, so 3 days ago I thought I'd try to see what would happen if I waited a few more hours.  I felt none of the really frightening side effects that users on this site and others have reported.  I figure better to get off it before my body becomes dependant.  I did get some uncomfortable stomach cramping when eating dinner last night, so I took some pepto bismol and took about 1/3 of my 150 mg capsule and woke up feeling great.  More energy than I've had while on Effexor.  I'm scared that I'll feel some scary side effects soon, but so far, thank God, I feel fine.  I wouldn't recommend going cold turkey, as most folks seem to have experienced absolute hell.  I wonder why I was so lucky.

Four years ago, I began taking Prozac for depression and Klonopin for anxiety.  I did really well with that combination except for one thing: my sex drive died. As a result, I asked my Dr to change my medication, and he reluctantly changed me to Wellbutrin and Lexapro.  My sex drive returned but I was miserable.  I ended up in Detox.  After that, I tried Cymbalta and Amitriptyline which did not help and had bad side effects.  Finally, I tried Effexor.  Its a miracle.  The very next day I felt 'normal'....something I hadn't felt in years but instinctively knew was right.  I have experienced no weight gain with  Effexor, my sex drive has returned, and I am 15 months sober.  I want to make 3 points.  1)Effexor is great for ME, 2)don't give up until you find what's right for you...its worth it, 3) some side effects aren't as bad as you think if you weigh all the consequences (i.e. no sex drive would have been better than ending up in Detox).

Started Effexor 13yrs ago and now take 225mg daily. Prescribed for depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, perimenopause. It has numbed me.  Side effects include: nightmares, much weight gain, blurred vision, loss of sex drive, confusion to the point of not being able to function, lost motivation. No longer want to be with people. Hard to feel any emotion except saddness/hopelessness. I'm certain it caused a problem with sleeping and got to the point that I was extremely fatigued.  Tests showed extremely low oxygen level when resting.  No energy.  Now sleep with a bi-pap machine which helps.  I was not overweight at the time. At first felt calm, but developed into talking too much, almost an excited/silly behavior that eventually passed after a few years. Tried to discontinue with the following side effects: extreme anxiety, anger over little things, aggressiveness,  crying spells, fearful (not my personality). I retired early due to not being able to function at my job. Now I feel really ignorant for not realizing the medication was causing many of these symptoms. I stayed on the drug because other meds hadn't worked for depression. My doctor said to ease off dosage by decreasing one pill per month.  Still horrible side effects and after two months of being completly off started back on meds.  You are asking why?  I just got tired of feeling so anxious and tearful or angry.  Not feeling was easier.  Guess I am very weak.  Am planning on changing doctors and again asking for help in discontinuing it.  I have a loving husband and children, but life is just too hard.   "

I was taking 150mg at breakfast and 75mg with supper. (225mg a day). I felt almost emotionless. Which could be a good thing for some. I recently quit taking effoxor because i didnt think i had deppression. Just anxiety.  I have been doing horrible. The brain shockls are unberable, I cannot think straight. I hate everhything. I am unsure on what to do. I am so confused. I take pain meds just to cope. I am either going to try another antideppresant or go back on Effexor XR. 
1306$Condition: Depression$7/18/2008 1:06:59 PM$Reviewer: sammyed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$4$"Having been diagnosed with major depression in my teens and now almost 50, I have tried numerous antidepressants. Effexor is best, although I fall in to denial of needing medication at all. It's true it has side effects, especially when you try to go off it, but weaning and keeping to as low a dose as possible should be the norm for ANY med! It helped me more than Prozac because it is a SNRI and not just a SSRI. That makes a difference for me. I still cried a lot on Prozac and lost sleep. For us diehard depressives, the worst side effect of all is committing suicide, right? Effexor helped me feel positive and productive. My BP med is also necessary though it has side effects--beats having a stroke! Sure, sexual interest declines but that happens without meds, to me. I say be grateful for the medication advances of this era, it sure beats the 1970-80's or earlier! I do manage side effects of Effexor by staying on 75 rather than the 150 I was on, to feel less robotic, as I saw it. 300 certainly sounds like a big dose to me and I've been hospitalized with depression 3 times. When ""weaning"", give yourself at least 3-4 weeks to gradually go off. I laugh that it is like a nuclear reactor going on and coming off line. But I don't want to go hang from a tree anymore. One day, maybe I will show true acceptance and quit going off my meds!"

When looking at reviews, read comments made by people who have taken Effexor XR for a significant amount of time.  This more accurately explains side effects, etc.  I have taken Effexor 300mg for over 7 years.  While in the beginning it was a God sent, with time I'm learning that the side effects are horrible.  I tried to ""ween"" myself off this med, and was in the ""brain shocks"" were the worst pain possible.  I was bed-ridden for 3 weeks and ended up caving in.  I am still on the medicine today and once again am going to try and ""ween"" myself off-because I want to get pregnant.

I went down to 225 mg by only taking (3) 75 mg caps.  At the end of two weeks, I will go down 75 mg more, which will put me at 150 mg daily.  I have had no withdrawal sysmtoms doing it this way.

I had chest pressure, my blood pressure would go up a lot and my vision was blurred.  That was at 75mg.  When I began to taper down, the withdrawls suck too.  You have to gradually wean yourself off till you're down to a crumb or you will have dizziness as well as other symptoms.

1324$Condition: Depression$6/23/2008 9:40:21 PM$Reviewer: Vase, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$4$I have been taking effexor for about 15 years, along with other antidepressants. (I've been on antidepressants since 1975.) I take 300mg in the morning and 75mg at night, along with Wellbutrin. . Effexor has worked very well most of the time. I still have the chronic crashes occasionally that can last for months, but that is the nature of the disease. I have none of the nausea, dizzy, or aggressive etc symptoms I read about here. The addictiveness is the only negative. I have gone into severe and dibilitating withdrawal when trying to trim down the dosage.  If I miss a dose I start wringing my hands, and become jumpy and fearful - even irrational. That makes me paranoid about running out, not being able to afford it, etc. even to the point of panic attacks. Antidepressants are also sneaky because you can think you are well and don't need it, when actually it is the pills themselves that make you better. If given a choice, I would still take the medication. It keeps me mostly non-suicidal (very rare - usually if pill supply is threatened) and as stable as one can expect. Yes I get angry about addictiveness, but I really appreciate not being so severely depressed, and being able to be functional, and at times even happy. I know too well the opposite.

Now at 150mg dose this medication has helped me to be calm in the beginning and I have more self-confidence now. The downside is I've become more of an aggressive, rude and outspoken person. Normally, I'm not rude or aggressive at all and my temper is flaring very often and the calm feeling is diminishing. It's almost as if I'm looking to be challenged and I've got to win at any cost. I've had chronic constipation, night sweats and arguments with my husband over petty things. He's asked me to please stop taking this medication. I want to stop but I'm afraid that I'm now a 'legal' drug addict. My dependence on this medication makes me feel weak and ashamed; but I panic if I miss a dose and I keep some in my car, purse and work just in case I forget it. I tried to stop taking it by cutting down on the dose and I cried for two days. This is a nightmare and I promised myself that I would never be dependent on anything or let anything control me; a promise now broken.

Negative:  Big issues with constipation.  I was having issues with clenching my jaw, but that seems to have gone away.

All in all, this seems to be a very effective drug.  I was a little bit scared of taking it due to all the negative posts on here, but so far I haven't had any major issues.  I take it at the same time every day, however, I did travel outside of my time zone and was several hours late in taking my meds.  I had no ill effects other than ""Shoot, I forgot to take my pill!""

On a side note:  Before starting on this medication, I was having problems with pains in my legs and leg jerking while sleeping.  Both of these issues have completely stopped (my husband is thrilled that the night leg jerking has ceased)

So far, I highly recommend this drug.  It has made my life better."

I have been prescibed prozac, zoloft, lexapro, and effexor xr.  The complete loss of sex drive i have had related to all these medications made me more depressed than ever.  All of these medications are effective for a while then plateau. The same with effexor. I havent been taking any mood altering medications for over six months.  The doctors wanted to counteract side effects with more pills! (ridiculous)  I feel more stable than ever, (life is supposed to have ups and downs).  Keeping eating and sleeping habits in check, I feel great.  I would reccomend steering clear of pills if at all possible.

Physically, I get these little ""shocks"" through my body. Don't want to be a slave to this drug the rest of my life.

I was taking 225MG everyday for a year and a half and I had very little side affects while I was taking it (trouble sleeping,nightmares,profuse sweating)but it seemed to lose effectivness very quickly. Rather than continue to up my dosage I was switched to 300MG of Wellbutrin once a day. I felt better while taking both medications but now that I am trying to get off of the Effoxor Xr I feel like I'm dying! I have gone from super happy to crying to total rage all within the last 2 hours. I was instructed to slowly lower my dosage over 2 weeks which I did and I don't think that was slow enough. I can not focus and I feel like I am going to vomit every second of the day. The pain in my head is not even comparable to a headache or migrain. Everytime I turn my head I feel like I am going to fall over and driving HA! thats a joke.I have been completley off of this pill for only 3 days and I have fully come to understand why addicts relapse. This should not be on the market and it should not be given out as quickly as it is. Doctors don't tell you that hey it may work for awhile but then when you come off of it you are worse than before you started taking it. I would NEVER recommend taking this regardless of how bad you think your depression is. Trust me it is much harder to deal with the thoughts and feelings while coming off this drug than it is to deal with the depression. If you do feel you need medication which I agree some do such as myself all I can say is do your research before you take anything, I wish I had done that.I would love to know if there is anything I can do to ease the withdrawl symptoms, please if anyone can help let me know before I end up taking another pill to make it stop!

1381$Condition: Depression$5/10/2008 1:28:04 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I have been taking Effexor XR 75mg for 4.5 years now.  It has given me my life back.  

It took me a long time to admit that I might be depressed, as I didn't want to face what I perceived as a stigma against depressed folks as deficient in character, lacking in faith, or ""crazy.""  Finally things got so bad (not getting out of bed on the weekends, suicidal thoughts), that I 
""gave up"" and went to see a counselor.  That was the best decision of my life (other than marrying my wife.. although I guess you could say that THAT wouldn't have happened had I not sought help!).

So after seeking help seven years ago I was diagnosed with double depression and started off with Prozac.  That didn't work, so switched to Zoloft.  Zoloft worked on my depression and I can vividly remember the joy of seeing leaves rustle in sunlight about 5 weeks after starting Zoloft and feeling happy for the first time years.  I gained 20 pounds of fat and lost my sex drive almost completely, but I was so happy to be ""alive"" again that I lived with those side effects for a couple of years.  Eventually I wanted more, so I dropped Zoloft cold turkey, lost weight, sex drive came back, but so did depression.  Finally got on Effexor XR and it has been a miracle.  A little sex drive lessening but not a lot, and no sexual function problems at all.  My depression has stayed away for the 4 years I've been on this drug.  

This drug has worked wonders for me, and I hope that it will for you.  Realize that no one drug works for everyone, and that you do have to try out different medications to find the one for you.

One thing -- if I skip a dose I can immediately tell, because I get a little dizzy, a little headache, etc.  I've heard that trying to go off Effexor can be very tricky.  Apparently if you want to go off you need to gradually lower the dose or switch to another med that can help while you're coming off of Effexor and then ""wean"" off of that.

God bless."

This medicine also increased my heart rate. I was only on this med for 11 days but decided to stop because of all the negtive side effects.

It's been 2 months and I've noticed fewer headaches and less blurred vision; slight increase in sex drive.

I grew up singing, dancing, and involved myself in art all my life until soon after I started taking the meddication. Coming off the meddication I did what my doctors told me to do, but during the intense withdrawl I tried to committ suicide three times - something totally out of character for me. I have stablized somewhat now, but I am still fell the both harsh physical and mental pain and frustration coming off of it. My doctor didn't think twice when she raised my dose after I became severly depressed and cut my arm open to such an extent I passed out from blood loss. I never felt that way before the medds. During this time I never thought something could do so much damage, and I trusted my doctors and parents. It's sad to think of myself naive when I decieded to finally try meddiction to help my at the time non-sucidal depression. My mom went on effexor to and I feel like I dont even know her any more. So far no one I have talked to believes me or cares to hear about the situation. This drug has piosoned my life, and it scares me that other people could have half the problems I did with it. For this drug to be put out on the market makes the world of XR even yet worse than it already does.

I have definitely noticed a huge difference in my thinking.  I have suffered from mild depression since a young child but finally seeked medical help.  At the moment my mind wants to drift to negative, pesimistic thoughts I can literally feel Effexor perk me up.  Unfortunately, I am also beginning to feel the side effects.  For the past 2 days, I feel like I am extremely hungry one minute, and within a split second I'm nausious.  For the past 5 days, I have been experiencing dreams that range from weird to deathly scary.  Within 3 days of my first dosage, I could tell my sex drive was gone.  After reading the numerous comments (good and bad) about Effexor, I have decided to come off of it.  Luckily I haven't been using it for very long.  For anyone considering Effexor, I strongly suggest that you do your homework on this medication; and if you do decide to try it, promise yourself that you will not let a doctor tell you that you need more mg to fix the problem.  Trust yourself and listen to your body.

I was unable to get out of bed and ended up sleeping for 3 days straight! I could not function so I'm back at the 300 mg dose. I'm going to try and get off of it slowly.

1407$Condition: Depression$4/21/2008 5:48:53 PM$Reviewer: elephantlover, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$1$I've been taking effexor xr for 7 or 8 years. It has worked wonders, but in the long-term I find that the side effects become overwhelming. I'm now maxed out at 300mg and have severe withdrawl symptoms every night. Because the med makes me a little hyperactive, I take it around 2:30am so that when it reaches full strength in my system it's time to wake up. The bummer about this schedule is that I have terrible nightmares and the worst night-sweats (soaking my sheets and pajama's) because of the withdrawl symptoms. If I miss a dose (god forbid!!) the withdrawls are crippling - headaches; shooting electricity type feelings originating from inside my skull and radiating out into my entire body; drastic mood swings; violent outbursts and uncontrolable anger; feeling unawake and groggy. This is just a partial list. I would like to taper off this medication, but I'm afraid of the withdrawls. Effexor has been great at treating my depression and helping me to take control. If anyone has successfuly gone off of effexor, I would appreciate any tips or advice you could share.

The withdrawl effects however are VERY hard to handle. I would caution anyone going on this drug about the withdrawl symptoms. My experience includes intense mood swings, very strange dreams, headaches, general depression symptoms, crying, lashing out at loved ones, violence to name a few. All of this on just missing one pill. I have also taken a couple of drug tests since being on Effexor and have NOT had a positive result for PCP or any other narcotics as reported from others.

Insomnia is a problem however and I have to take Ambien CR to sleep and I have some mild sexual effects.  Headaches are a problem if I miss a dose.  In my opinion the benefits of this drug far outweigh the side effects.  My dose has just been increased to 150mg due to some mild loss of effectiveness at the lower dose, but given my current life circumstances this is not surprising.  Since starting Effexor I have lost the weight the Zoloft made me gain, I have less social anxiety, and I am able to deal with things MUCH better.  I am generally happier with life in general and I would recommend this medication.

Sadly, instead of getting relief, I ended up with what felt like a psychotic break. I had severe mood swings, moving between a complete lack of emotion and severe crying spells. I couldn't control my emotions, I couldn't make decisions, I ended up almost attempting suicide (my friend caught me). I ended up in the hospital because of this medicine. As soon as I stopped the medicine I started feeling better. By far the worst and scariest reaction I have ever had to a drug, and I have had lots of horrible ones.

Of my 81 years of age, I have been depressed for over half my life. I have been through all kinds of depression medication. So far I believe that effexor has helped me more than the others. Not wanting to be on medication, when I started feeling better I started cutting back on the dosage from 5 tablets of 75mg to 2 tablets of 75 mg. This was without my doctor's approval. While on a trip, I ran out of medication for about 3 days. I went into a deep depression which I describe as a living hell. After I saw my doctor, and he chewed my ass out for cutting back on the medicatin without his knowledge, he thought I would be on the maximum amount and dossage the rest of my life.Rather than going back down into that deep dark valley,although I dont feel that I am complety over my depression, I wil stay with his recommendations.
1426$Condition: Depression$4/9/2008 6:57:16 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$3$"I have had depression for as long as I can remember and was diagnosed with it early in my adult life. I had been through prozac, which I loved at first, but after a few years lost its effectiveness. Apparently antidepressants do that after prolonged use. I have been thought Zoloft, Wellbutrin and I think Cymbalta, I'm not real sure about Cymbalta.
Anyhow, the Effexor has been working, I'm actually taking its generic version Veneflexine (I think that's how it's spelled)  It was slow to work at first and I think my Dr got a little crazy with the dosages as he had me taking 5 pills a day. Although I convinced him I could get by with less and I'm taking 300 mg, or 3 a day. It's somewhat inconvenient in that I take 2 in the morning and 1 at night, but aside from that I have been happy with it. No real side effects, possibly insomnia, but I've had that before I started taking it.
I just know what I was like before I started taking it, and what I'm like now and it does work. I never really had a major problem with anxiety, perhaps once very rarely usually situational in cause, however I can't say that I've experienced in anxiety since I've taken it, but then again haven't had much situations to cause it either....whew!
I personally would give the medication a thumbs up.  It does work, however everyone's wired slightly different. So if it doesn't work, don't give up on your treatment. There are a lot of medications out there, and keep searching until you find the right one, it will definitely make life worth living again."

I was suffering from severe panic attacks and did try to commit suicide. I have been on this medication for 5 years now. I am 59 years old, and suffered from depression since my 30's. My only warning about this medication is DO NOT RUN OUT OF IT, always make sure you have your prescription, just one day without Effexor and it feels as though electric shocks are going off in my brain every 2 to 3 minutes, I cannot relax but I am able to focus. It is not a pleasant experience, so I always make sure I don't run out of it.

The dosage was increased steadily until I switched to Zoloft at 21.

From the age of 14 to 21, I experienced no sex drive. I would not recomend this drug for teens.

I am now on 300mgs Efexor and 300mgs of Wellbutrin a day and am ok again. However, with the increased meds I do suffer with some ED and lack of sexual desire and some lack of overall emotions.  So beware at about 3 to 5 years as you may need an increase in dosage(not just me, read through the reviews and you will see). The ""great"" thing about efexor if I miss a dosage after about 4 hours extreme headaches and dizziness remind me to take it. I do not look forward to the day I ever try to get off this med, as just taking a pill late can give me such a killer headache, and taking the dose does not immediately take it away. So even if the drug works well for a long time, keep an eye on yourself as you may need an increase later on!  "

I called my ins. co. and complained to 8 people over a period of 6 weeks, before I could speak to a supervisor.
I will not tke a drug made in a foreign country in light of what has just happened with heprin. As a result of taking the generic,I felt like I was leaving my body physically and mentally. The generic form of Effexor just about did me in, as I was told I had to tke 150 mg.of it to get the same benefits of the brand. I was also  told that paroxitine was a generic for Effexor. I worked in the health care industry for over forty years and know better.How sad that we have people deciding what meds our ins. will pay for who have no more drug education than this.Because I still work, I do not qualify for a $0 copay and because my ins. will not pay for the brand. The brand Effexor was on the formulary at the beginning of 2008, but disappeared a week after I tried to fill my Rx. I guess i grew up in a time when peoples lives had some meaning and money wasn't the priority.

It seemed like after a few years that it wasn't working as effectively with my monthly PMS,too.  The doctors asked me if I wanted to increase the dosage(sure glad I didn't).  Now five years later, I want to discontinue taking Effexor and I feel horrible.  I have been decreasing the dosage as my doctor instructed and only stopped taking it all together for five days and feel HORRIBLE.  I have all the symptoms that everyone else describes.  It is really sad to hear that one writer says he/she feels the withdrawal symptoms still have 6 months.  I wish I had known about the terrible withdrawl symptoms when I first started taking it.  I would have reconsidered.  I would definitely tell anyone out there to try other anti-depressants before taking this drug.  My doctor is putting me back on the low dose 37.5 mg because of my symptoms.  I am determined to get off this drug sooner or later.  I think I will try the antioxidants that other writers have been talking about and perhaps suggest to my doctor to take Prozac.

The start-up side effects weren't bad, a little weight loss, night sweats, loss of sexual desire. THe kicker is coming off this medicine.  Wish I had been warned of the withdrawls.  Nausea, whirling, forgetfullness, exhaustion, moodiness, crying, blurry vision, dizziness, the list goes on. A friend told me when I decided to stop taking the medicine that it would be hell - wish the doctor had told me that when I started taking it. They got me - either I pay the extreme monthly cost (since there is no generic and I have no rx insurance any longer) or I suffer the withdrawls.  If you plan on taking this drug - get informed first.

My mother tried the medicine but she could not tolerate it at all.

The dosage was increased 12/10/07 to 225 mg / day.  My psychiatrist pulled me off the medication as of 3/5/08.  I'm going through some serious withdrawals due to the elimination of this medication.  I'm in a partial hospitalization program for treatment of bi-polar, however, I was told there was nothing that could be done regarding the withdrawal symptoms.  Everyone I've talked to say that quitting Effexor cold turkey is EXTREMELY bad due to side affects.  I hurt from hair to toe nail.  I experience ""jolts"" in my brain; I have constant ringing in my ears; my mood changes are awful.  If you are ever instructed to cease this medication immediately and abruptly, I strongly urge you to discuss the side affects (withdrawal symptoms) with your MD--it's the hardest thing I've ever done and I don't know how long it will take before the medication is completely out of my system.  I feel completely helpless against these symptoms.  I don't ever want to go through something like this again."

I took it because I was having difficulty handling my 3 yr old ADHD son and a marriage filled with a lot of conflict.  After a while some of the despression came back but the rage and anger I felt during PMS has not come back.  After about 1.5 yrs I went down to 32.5 mg because I noticed at 75 mg I just didn't have much ambition.  My house wasn't as clean as I wanted and I just didn't get much done except what absolutely had to get done.  I feel better on the 32.5.  After about a month adjustment..I am back to feeling pretty even most of the time...still feel PMS some but it is manageable and I have much more energy to do things and I feel more organized than I have since I first started taking it.  Right now...the 32.5 works well for me.

My brain felt like electroyde were going off all the time.  I felt very bad.  The worst thing that it did was take away my taste buds for over a month.  I couldn't taste ANYTHING.  I found a web site that mentioned this reaction and showed it to my doctor.  He called the drug company.  They were not aware of this happening.  I had printed out the artical on the web site and the drug company were really surprised.  I'm off on Effexor XR but couldn't handle the return of depression and anixety so am now on Lexapro.

It has an immediate effect  20 mins afer taking first dose i was laughing !!! longer term removed some of the deperesssio and most of the anxiety sysptoms. Caused high blood presure and increase in weight, total suppression of any sex drive, impotence. benefits did not last and extreme discontinuation symptoms when trying to stop even though tapered off over several months and finally replaced with prozac which was then tappered off as well. withdrawal symptoms persist still after 6 months of not taking effexor. one dose of prozac or effexor removes symptoms immediately so not a recurrance of original problem. i Would only recommend using effexor as a last resort it is virtually impossible to stop taking it once you start. Withdrawal efects i have had are worse than original problem. I now have severe confusion, mania, violent outbursts and physical manifestations include dizzyness , trembling limbs, sweats, stomach problems. The original depression is still present and the anxiety is if anything worse. however i have been on virtually all the different types of medications in the past 30 years and effexor was the firt to make a difference, but at what a price?!.

Terrible whirling feeling.  I have taken this for 7 years.  This is the second time I've tried to get off this drug.  1st time the doctor and I assumed that I just wasn't ready and the symptoms were the depression.  This past month I am going to get off the medication come hell or high water.   Enough is enough.  I feel terrible, have gained 50 lbs since I started it, problems with blood pressure and I see someone is having issues with liver.  Bingo, so am I.  Don't know quiet yet, I am being tested.
I feel like hell right now.  Body aches, ringing in ears, whirling ,felling like crying, bolting,  almost like a flu, muscles hurt.   But have reading all these reactions, I am going to give it all I have to get off of this stuff.   Aren't the drug companies at fault for this kind of problem.  I was not told, read, heard anything that this was a possibility.   I would have tried something else for the depression.  I glad to see that I'm not alone, but also sorry to hear so many are having the same problem.  I tried to tell my doctor that I read how difficult it was to get off this, but she said, yes you can.   I didn't think to ask, at what expense.   On the flip side, if she didn't give a positive attitude you might wallow in that idea.   All in all, this stinks.   I feel like hell and hoping that I'll make it out of this drug.
All the best to those who are trying as well.

Words are completely lost to me at times...I know the word I want to use is somewhere in my brain, but can't come up with it.  I mix up words, forget names, can't remember where I put things.  Sense of time also seems ""off"".  Something that happened yesterday can feel like years ago and vice versa.  More tired now than ever.  I could sleep most of the day.  In general my mood is much improved, but sometimes I feel like I'm loosing my mind.  My husband says I've improved incredibly on Effexor, so I guess I'm staying on it. I'd like to think there's something better out there, but I'm afraid of withdrawing from Effexor.  Have been on Prozac and Paxil over the years before switching to Effexor."

If anything it just made me feel numb to my emotions.  I understand the need for mood stablizers, but I feel they're made available too easily.  Doctors seem too ready to hand out medication to mask the problem rather than work it out.  The worst part of this drug (beside the minor, but annoying side effects) was the withdrawl.

I can't function, I can't think, I feel dizzy, hot flashes, headaches and I pretty much just feel like I'm going crazy. I felt better being depressed. I have a whole new respect for drug addicts. If detox is anything like this, no wonder the relapse rate is so high."

I am now taking some OTC items which are helping tremendously. I saw that some people trying to escape the Effexor demon were taking fish oil supplements and multivitamin/minerals, so I'm now taking Organic Flaxseed Oil and a Mega Vitamin/Mineral Complex with an additional boost of B-Complex Vitamins which I purchase cheaply with very low shipping costs from http://www.VitaCost.com. Some treatment programs are stating that with the depletion of antioxidants, one needs to add a product such as gluathione supplementation. This is also available from VitaCost very cheaply. I've added another super antioxidant, Acai pure freeze-dried pure organic powder from Amazon Thunder, the provider of Acai for the Oprah Show documentary. I take my scoopful daily in juice, but some people like it in applesauce, yogurt, etc. It has no sugar added and is completely organic. It's available from http://www.amazonthunder.com/members/coonmartranc h. I've been using these dietary boosters during the entire time and will continue to do so for several months after I'm completely off the Effexor as my withdrawal symptoms have been minimal. Let me know if this suggestion helps or not. Best wishes.........

Over a month ago I started taking effexor, my doctor told me to wean myself off wellbutrin, so I have slowly trying. Back to effexor, I don't like it and would not recommend it to anyone. I have had suicidal feelings, frequent crying spells, so tired, anxiety worse, affraid to make decisions, paranoid, burden on my family and a constant feeling of despair and hopelessness. I tried to relate these feelings to the only person in my life who would listen (my sister) and it only back-fired on me. My wording is all off and I'm so scared. I'm getting off this stuff or I'm just going to lose it. I live alone and don't have anyone close to me (got my sister mad) and afraid to go anywhere or be around people. Can anyone tell me how to do this without feeling crazier than I already feel? Please help!

This medicine just makes me feel blah - not happy, not sad - just like I'm a lump taking up space.  I took many other anti-depressants and they didn't work.  I also take an anti-anxiety medication which I like and would continue to use.  I just wish to quit taking Effexor.  If I didn't have to work, I would definitely do the cold turkey way.  I would think long and hard about taking this medication.  I had no problems at all coming off the other anti-depressants.

I would run to the bathroom several times a day and look at that poor guy in the mirror having a bad trip and say ""I'm you and your messed up"". When I called my doctor and said what was going on he said ""double the dose"". For some reason I didnt think of it but after crying for 48 hours and begging the doctor to stop it he just said ""dont take anymore"".

I was given a heavy dose 300 mg/day. On it for ~18 months. Started to reduce the dosage and what I call 'neurochemelectrical discharges' started zapping my brain. It was tolerable and expected. Kept reducing the dosage slowly as directed. Finally made it down to 37.5mg/1x day and the 'neurochemeletrical' circus was raging...but slightly tolerable. Went totally off and felt like I was back in college having the worst psychadelic experience of my life. Called the Dr. and picked up two more titration packets with the 37.5s and eased them back in and then started staggering them every other day and longer. My brain finally settled down a little. I was ready to stop again, and did so. I was still seeing (and mostly feeling...tracers) but they were tolerable. I was off for 8 days...yes 8 (eight, 7+1, etc.) so it was out of my system but the psychadelic party was still going. I broke down and took a 75mg capsule I had...just in case... Bottom line. THIS STUFF IS REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET OFF OF! Please consider this if your Dr. suggests it. Believe me, I know how bad things may seem, but please consider all options. I now have to start the original (or generic) Effexor at 25 mg for 7 days and then split them to 12.5 mg for 7 days. I am pretty tough (now anyway...) by most standards but this (withdrawl) is, in my opinion, worse than depression. I know how to take care of that now without meds. Just please look into it before getting on it.

While taking the medication, I have had the dosage adjusted several times. The most prevalent side effect for me was hot flashes and weight gain. Under medical supervision, I tried to decrease the dosage of the medication in an attempt to ultimately stop taking it. Yet, as the dosage was decreased I found myself becoming more depressed and even suicidal. Therefore, I had to increase the dosage again. I feel that this medication has contributed to my hypersomnia. However, my doctor disagrees. I will continue to seek a change in my medication. Yet, I will continue to take this medication for the time being. I take three 75 mg tabs once a day.

I take 75mg once every morning.  I have been increasingly fidgety, and there are times when I can't stop tapping my feet.  Sleep is more difficult.  My doctor says that this is normal when starting Effexor and it will go away within a week or so.  I hope he's right.  I've never had such strong side effects from a psych med.

The process is difficult, but by the 8th day or so, you will start feeling better.

Depression syptoms lessened, but now I never cry and my emotions seem stifled. My sex life is non-existent as I have no libido and cannot orgasm.

My feeling of not being full is gone already but now I am experiencing a lot of dizziness, or head rushes constantly as a withdrawl from this medication which is why I am researching this further on this website.

I take this drug for PMDD.  My husband says that I am sweet otherwise but during this time I am really upset over small things and at times have very very negative thoughts.

When trying to go to a smaller dosage after about a week or 2 on the 75 dosage, I felt a bad shocking sensation in my head. This was alarming but I was glad to know that I was not the only one.  The medicine does help me with my over all mood and I don't get as anxious or concern about things as much as I used to.

I refused to go any place where I would be locked in, so he prescribed Wellbutrin along with the EffexorXR. I have multiple diseases, and daily take some 15 different drugs, including opiates for pain. I have been seeing this man for almost 5 years quarterly for scripts for a controlled med. I wanted off the Effexor, I beleived it was causing the Weight Loss,(130 lbs to 89lbs) Drooling, Hallucinations

Overall I really have really liked this medication. It has had an impact on my life. I had social anxiety disorder as well as depression. Both of them were cleared up for a long time. 

Unfortunately, I burned out at my job last year and have ended up in the hospital for depression. I don't really want to say that my medication didn't work because I think I really caused my burnout (working 80+ hours/week, volunteering, etc.) My doctor bumped up my dosage from 150 to 225 and that seems to have helped me (along with a lot of therapy). Sometimes I am concerned though that maybe it is losing its effect on me. I hope not... I am not sure what I would change to. 

It was sort of rough in the beginning of taking this medication - I was hyper and it was harder to sleep. Those effects wore off after a couple of months. 

Now my side effects seem to include night sweats (sometimes the sheets are wet), weight gain (some, but it could just be that I am getting older), and my orgasms are different (its like I feel them through a filter). If I miss taking it for a few hours I feel vertigo and sort of out of body. Miss two days and I just quit moving. It sucks. I try to avoid that at all costs now :)

Overall I am pleased with this medication. I was on Paxil before and all I felt like doing was stare at the wall.

1594$Condition: Depression$1/8/2008 10:34:26 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$4$"I've been on Effexor XR 300mg/day for at least two years now (used Zoloft for years, have also been prescribed buproprion/wellbutrin, trazadone, zyprexa, gabitril).
I like effexor because I had no side effects and it seemed to work well.  I felt a bit numb and still have some trouble concentrating and cannot hold extreme emotions for very long, but I think this drug is effective.  The negative is that the withdrawal symptoms SUCK.  Unfortunately this drug does not 'build up' in the system, so after 24 hours, you will definitely feel the missed dose.  I am miserable and won't even drive when I feel that way.  The worst part is that it makes me sleep, and not really wake up.  I've missed work, classes, etc.  If you are forgetful or cannot remember to take meds daily (missing more than 3 days a month), or even a little undisciplined (like me) I'd say don't do Effexor XR.  Once you take the missed dose, though, it kicks in a few hours later.  I'm looking to switch again, as I feel it does not work nearly as good as at the beginning of treatment (2+ years ago)."

I would fly into rages over minor things, had short-term memory losses that felt like the way people describe Alzheimers, could not concentrate, and developed blurry vision.

It took quite a while to understand how it effected my body, and the proper times to take it, so that its side effects fit my schedule.  To avoid being tired, I started taking the medication at 5:00 AM (150mg) so that I could sleep for an hour after taking it, thereby avoiding the exhausted feeling mid-morning.  I take my other dose (150mg) at 10:00 PM, or right before bed.  IMPORTANT - Do not stop taking this medicine ""cold turkey"" and definitely talk to your doctor before you change the dosage.  Contrary to early studies, this drug has addictive properties that manifest themselves in the form of EXTREME vertigo.  I ran out of medicine for two days, by the morning of the third day, I could barely walk without weaving and bumping into things.  The emergency room doctor told me this was due to my abrupt change in dosage, and after a day of taking my medicine, I was fine."

Since I have been on effexor I have gained about 70lbs and have lost most of my normal energy, which is straining my marriage.

Initially I experienced benefits from the medication, but eventually these benefits were replaced by negative side-effecs which crippled me.  I gradually discontinued the Zoloft (against medical advice) and my health improved dramatically!  I continued to take the Effexor, although the therapeutic benefits diminished and I was plagued with dark, destructive and suicidal thoughts.  I decided to wean myself off of the Effexor (against doctor's advice again).  It took me about 2 months gradually reducing the dosage (sometimes increasing it again when withdrawal symptoms occurred).  Today I use only diazepam (5mg x 3) to control anxiety and panic.  My experience with prescription antidepressants is that the initial benefits diminish over time to be replaced by negative side-effects.  Effexor may be a good short-term therapy, but over time the side-effects increased and the benefits disappeared.  Diazepam in the only prescription that has provided consistent, continuous and effective treatment.

Then it had gotten rid of my angry outburts and given me patience, which dramatically changed my relationships with many in a positive way. But lately I've noticed many changes. I sleep alot and am extremely fatigued. I am numb & emotionless. I have lost all  motivation in daily life . Constipation. Lessened sexual desire. And I too feel the ""brain jitters"" but mostly when something happens that would usually make me upset and cause the angery outbursts. When I have them it makes me feel like a freak who isn't being myself! I would love to get off the medication but am very scared to experience the side effects to the fullest effect. I have missed up to 4days of doses at once and felt horrible. Lots of sharp pained headaches! I do believe that this drug is intended for a lifetime of use.

I don't know what I would have gone through with out it.  In the begining, it takes a little while to start working, but as soon as it does, you will know it.  Things get better!  The only thing I have noticed that I dislike very much about it, your sex drive diminishes and it is very frustrating, but after speaking to my doctor, he found a solution.

Wellbutrin made me irritable, and Lexapro made me feel flat. I have had no side effects because my doctor started me on 35 mg and has gradually increased the dose to 150 mg.

I'm on 150 mg/day (I was briefly on 300 mg/day in an effort to treat ADHD symptoms but have since dropped back to 150 mg and added focalin) and it seems to be the best I'll get from antidepressants.  At the higher dose I started feeling emotionally numb (I'd recognize I _should_ be sad, but I wouldn't feel it), I'd sweat a lot (very weird), I had crazy dreams, and generally I just felt...weird.  At 150 mg, though, I have regular emotions, and I still get sad sometimes, but it's ""normal"" sad, emotions that I should be feeling.  It keeps me much more level and really functional.  It works great for me."

I've been on it since 1999 when I was diagnosed with a chemical imbalance, depression, panic attacks, etc....finally, after being unhappy for so many years and being unable to control my runaway emotions and my temper. I recommend Effexor as it really does help you even things out and you are able to become the person you're meant to be, without all the depression, anger, and anxiety that a chemical imbalance can cause. I can't imagine ever going off Effexor as it has helped me change my life.

Missing just one dose would make me feel zaps in my brain. I tried to stop taking it once after the 1st year(under my doc) and couldn't do it. The next year I was finally able to taper down, but had severe brain zaps for months afterwards, developed acne for the first time in my life.  The scars are now starting to heal and I don't have zaps anymore-occasionally though. It's been since February and it's December now...I would recommend anything BUT effexor...
1668$Condition: Depression$12/10/2007 5:25:37 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$1$1$I have to say this drug is great for depression and anxiety BUT...once you try to go off of it the withdrawl is similar to opiod/heroin/narcotic withdrawl. I tried going off the 75mg of Effexor XR slowly by taking 37.5 for 2 weeks(under my doctors supervision) and I literally thought I was going to end up in the hospital because I was vomiting, sweating, shaking and in excruciating pain for days. Unfortunatly I feel like I am going to be stuck on this medication for the rest of my life because the withdrawl is more than I can bare. I ended up going right back on the 75mg a day because nothing I did made me feel better once the drug was out of my system. I give the drug credit for its effectiveness in treating depression especially if you have tried other drugs and nothing has worked, but this is more of a long term treatment rather than a quick fix. 
1669$Condition: Depression$12/10/2007 10:41:55 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$1$1$1$I tried Effexor this past year due to increased weight gain with my Celexa.  I have to tell you that this was an awful medication for me.  I was extremely nauseated and had awful headaches when first taking this medication.  I continued with the tretment thinking I was being a wimp, well the nausea somewhat subsided and the headaches, but then the uncontrollable sweating started. I was soaking wet all day and with this medication in combination with Dexadrine for ADD I actually felt numbness in my lips and chest pain one morning on the way to work.  Heart attack? Who knows...It scared the bejeebers out of me though, I went back to the Celexa again and remain on it currently with again the same weight gain issues.  It is a bum deal for those of us who are fighting depression, to know that you are going to gain weight which being a female, we all know it is hard enough everyday of our lives to try to maintain a healthy weight.

The worst side effect was what seemed like all night-long dreams of sheer terror where I was literally fighting for my life. Others included extreme nausea, high blood pressure, dizziness, hallucinations, numbness in my right hand,and agitation. It is the worst experience from any medication I have ever been on.  I would seriously warn anyone who is considering taking this medication to see  his or her doctor WEEKLY until the medicine takes its full affect. It may help someone, but it almost killed me.

It did nothing for my depression, caused me to gain over 40lbs (which I had just recently lost), caused extreme diarrhea and vomitting, and made me emotionless.  My fiance and I split up because I felt nothing.  I was literally numb of emotions.  I couldn't laugh or cry.  I wasn't happy or sad.  I was just there.  I absolutely hated this drug.  I switched to this from Wellburtin because of Wellbutrin's side-effects, but the side-effects of Effexor were much worse and not worth the switch.  I'm back on Wellbutrin, and have my life back under control.  No more crazy thoughts, diarrhea, vomitting, or numbness.  Effexor works for some, but is definitely not for all.

I am trying to be patient so that I can have relief from depression, and not worry about what the drug is doing to me. It affects EVERYONE DIFFERENTLY so please don't be scared of what others report about THEIR side effects. If you find it doesn't help keep your mood steady and positive, try something else like adding therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy to your 'arsenal of support'  Do not go off effexor cold turkey, this is stated everywhere and many people ignore this warning, which causes problems. Warnings and directions are there for a reason and following the instructions can help you to have a more positive, healthy experience with anti-depressants. I hope this has been helpful for those of you considering effexor for depression/anxiety or whatever it may be for you, and know that ANY step toward getting help for yourself is a good one!! also, congrats for educating yourself first!  good luck everyone.

I take 150mg Effexor with breakfast and I also take 20mg Adderall tablets 2X/day, once with breakfast and one with lunch.  The Effexor by itself does an excellent job for me with depression, anxiety and nervousness.  I do, however get extremely sleepy when using it alone.  So the Dr. prescribed the Adderall to offset this by keeping me alert during the day and also to help me focus.  I don't have any side effects whatsoever except I am a little bit numbed or non-emotional, this may just be due to being so anxious for so many years.  I would give anything to be able to go back to my childhood and had these medicines then.

I wish I had taken it years earlier, because I have been dysthymic for most of my life (60). After I had BC, was on Tamoxifen, and other major life changes, I went from ""not happy"" to not  wanting to ""do"" tomorrow - not suicidal, but significantly different ... tired.It's gotten me out of the pit. For the past couple of years I have also taken Adderall for ADHD.  This threesome seems to work.  How long will I have to take it?  Who knows? The alternative sucks. I may yet try reducing the dosage, because all these chemicals can't be all that great for my liver. I'm just glad I found a doctor who was willing (and able - a PhD (Biochemistry) along with the MD) to try different combinations until we found one that would work. Once I went through a period of missing dosages here and there that must have mounted up.  I can miss 150mg of my total 375mg/day without ill effects - more than that is too great a drop at once. Coming off the drug is not pleasant, I hear, but it is doable and takes a l-o-n-g time. Have to be patient."

However, like many others, I experience severe withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose. I've tried to get off it to start another drug and have been unable to do so. I was up to 450 mgs whereas my father only took 75 mgs and did not have trouble getting off the drug when it was time. I experience nausea, ""brain shivers"", crying and severe depression when I miss more than one dose. Also cannot have an orgasm (or a very weak one anyway). Think seriously and discuss thoroughly with your doctor before starting this drug. I had tried nineteen different combinations of drugs before I started taking Effexor XR. Exhaust other possibilities first. I'm afraid that I'm going to be on this drug forever, whether I need to be or not. I'm not certain that it's been worth it."

My Effexor treatment is supplemented with low dose Dexadrine. This is closely monitored by my MD. The help of Dexadrine is an often overlooked or underprescribed medication because of the unnecessarily fearful connection of the ""speed"" phenomenon - this is from a complete lack of education on the part of the MD as regards the usefulness of this medication, at proper times, to supplement the fatigue that can accompany depression."

I feel this has not helped my mood as expected and when I stopped I began having horrible side-effects.  The most bothersome where what is described as ""brain shocks"" or ""brain surges"".  They're not painful, however they happen repeatedly throughout the day and make me dizzy often.  If I would have known about this side-effect that is rarely mentioned, I definitely would have thought again from taking this medication."

My PCP put me on this right before I left home for college.  She thought the stress I was going through was related to depression but the fact was I was scared to move 15 hours away to go to school.  I was on this medication for 2 years and if I missed a single dose, I would feel the withdrawal symptoms immediately.  I would have trouble walking, very unsteady (like I was 80 years old), extreme sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, weakness, tired all the time.  When I tried to stop taking the medication, I couldn't go more than 2 days even with 37.5 mg.  Finally, I just had to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and laid on a couch for a whole week until I was completely detoxed.  It was the worst experience of my life...and the medicine did nothing to help my ""depression"".  RESEARCH everything before you start taking something that you know nothing about.  Don't trust your doctor just because they went to medical school."

I can tell that the drug is working because I dont get as angry at work about every little thing anymore. I have this, dont care attitude now. I have had to go more than 24 hrs without it because of the cost and it was very uncomfortable. I have tried other antidepressants and never experienced anything like this. I got extreme nausea, upset stomach, brain buzzes and more. I am on the highest does my Dr can give me, 225mg a day. Recently I asked for something cheaper and was rx the generic. I see or feel no difference.

I also deal with adult ADD, and Effexor has made it easier for me to concentrate and follow through on tasks. I'm very thankful to my doctor for recognizing the signs of both depression and ADD and prescribing this for me.
1807$Condition: Depression$10/4/2007 11:12:25 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$4$I take 300mg per day (2 pills of 150mg), which is 1 dose away from the most mg allowed to be prescribed by law.  If I do not take this medication EXACTLY 24 hours every day, immediately I start getting withdrawl symtoms. Being a recovered drug addict, I know it is much like a withdrawl from heroin. 1st is the migraines. Then the sweating, bones hurting, vomiting, diareah, it's horrible. But, that's how I never miss a dose. The more extreme symptoms I wrote about do not happen until the 1st full 24 hours without the medicine. But, nonetheless, I've been free from depression for 4 years now, and clean and sober for the same amount of time. i would recommend this product only if you plan to be on it for a LONG period of time, as you can tell what it will be like to try to get off of it.

1823$Condition: Depression$9/23/2007 4:23:40 AM$Reviewer: Edana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$5$I was on Prozac for years, and the doctor wanted to try Effexor XR. Within four months, I was suicidal and totally withdrawn. Saw a medicine specialist who put me on Wellbutrin, but I am still on the Effexor XR. It has proven nearly impossible to get off of it, unless I am willing to spend three weeks in a locked psychiatric ward. It doesn't seem to do anything until we try to titer me off the drug (300mg daily). Then I am in awful pain, sick, nauseated, and have to get back on it again. I am 61 years old and have a terminal illness. Considering that I should have been dead a year ago, I am just not willing to be shut away from husband and family for three weeks. My personal opinion is that the entire inventory of Effexor XR should be burned!

Then upped the dosage to 75mg as directed.  After I would say 6 months I wanted to cut back down to the 37.5 dossage.  I went off the charts. I went back to the 75mg, and since now I am at 150mg.  I hope that someday I will not have to take this anymore, but at this time it seems unlikely.
