1$Condition: Depression$12/17/2019 9:12:37 PM$Reviewer: ?, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$4$5$I started taking Venlafaxine ER in my late 60's for what I thought was a recent situational depression, only to discover I had been subject to a mild depression all my life, perhaps even from birth.  Without that drug, I would have never known. 
2$Condition: Depression$11/12/2019 8:47:32 AM$Reviewer: Psworrell , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$1$5$Never really addressed depression.  My anxiety did lower.  I just stopped having any emotions except  anger.  I developed  eosinophil reaction on arms and esophagus after 21 years on med.  Tried 3 times to taper off.  Last try I  used prozac to help taper and after 3 months am off completely.  Never again.  I'm  off of it now 60 days.  Still have brain zaps and headaches.
3$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$11/11/2019 9:38:26 PM$Reviewer: pipelineguy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$3$3$I have been on various doses ranging from 37.5 to 150 per day. I found it made my range of emotions much narrower, but unfortunately it dulled the highs ... I found the higher dose was causing ED and some crazy dreams. Difficult to get off of. I am no longer taking it.

I have overwhelming nausea, dizziness, and headaches at least 2 days a week. I love what the drug has done for my mental health but my physical health, not so much.
5$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/7/2019 12:06:36 PM$Reviewer: kittykat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$Have been taking 150mg daily for 20 years.  First few yrs I tried weaning and coming off only to have awful anxiety and confusion back, bed bound again and unable to function.  Accepted Iâ??d be taking this drug long term.  Keeps me focused, confident and stable in mood.  Extreme nausea, weird vibrating head and vertigo if I forget to take it 2+days. Thank you Effexor XR for allowing me to experience happy life and probably saving my life in general.  Dreading the day I can’t take this drug anymore for whatever reason life throws at me.

A long time now I have accepted 150mg daily, I?m focused, confident, stable in mood.  Anxiety no longer has me bed bound or unable to function.  Dreading a time in the future if I can no longer take this drug for whatever reason.

My sleep has been very good but you do have very vivid interesting dreams.  This drug changed and saved my life.

12$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/24/2019 12:35:51 AM$Reviewer: kaybee, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$My first time on Effexor three years ago, I quit it cold turkey due to side effects. DO. NOT. DO. THIS. I threw up for a week, had cold chills, and couldn't leave my bed. It was full blown withdrawal. I recently had an uptick in my panic disorder and depression, compounded by PTSD. Because Effexor had worked to manage my day-to-day symptoms before, I was placed back on it. There are definitely side effects if I miss a dose, such as vomiting and dizziness. I've also noticed that even taking it regularly, I've developed an aversion to solid foods. It may be from the vomiting when I was changing doses, but it's pretty bothersome living off of yogurt and protein shakes until the drug starts wearing off at night. My panic disorders have become few and far between, and to me, that is worth the annoying side effects and dependence. 
13$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$3/23/2019 9:34:34 PM$Reviewer: Kimhen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$One pill was all it took. Do not take this! I have PTSD and severe anxiety. I also shake like a cold wound up Chiwawa! I have been taking Xanax for years and it worked great. My DR retired and my new Dr after getting me off that prescribed meEffexor. 4 hrs after my first dose, dizzy, throwing up, slurred speech and horrible headache and the shaking is horrible. 1st dose was enough for me. I would rather be on nothing than feel like this. It has a short life so hopefully I will start feeling better within a day or 2.

17$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$3/3/2019 11:37:06 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$1$4$DO NOT TAKE THIS POISON UNLESS YOU ARE OK WITH THE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS. Yes it works for depression and anxiety but if you ever want to quit taking it you will go through hell. I was taking Zoloft and it quit working. Dr suggested effexor XR. It was like a miracle. I could enjoy life again. I woke up with a sense of possibility. Worked great for about 5 years then it seemed to quit working as well. So I upped my dose. Even then the results weren't the same as they had been. Finally after 10 years at the age of 28 I decided to work with my Dr and go on Prozac. I slowly decreased from 150 mg effexor down to 37.5 and was even to the point where I had samples of 37.5 I would open and dump out half. It didn't matter. Side effects we're HORRIBLE. I couldn't think. I would find myself just standing staring off into space not sure what I had been doing. Weird swooshing noises in my head. Took me a half hour one day just to get dressed because I couldn't focus. It was the worst experience of my life. It was impossible to work or drive or do anything normal. This medicine should be used only as a last resort.

I get tremors in my sleep and terrifying nightmares. My sex drive is non existent. I canâ??t display emotion. I constantly feel like Iâ??m dreaming when wide awake. Effexor turned me into a zombie.

24$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/29/2018 3:30:24 PM$Reviewer: Mackenzie , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$My experience of this med was horrific. At 150mg I hit a new low. Was suicidal, impulsive, vomiting constantly and had frequent panic/anxiety attacks. Was so desperate to come off this medication I went cold turkey. Huge mistake. Developed discontinuation syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms were terrible. Fever, tremors, hives, night terrors, vertigo, insomnia, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms and vomiting. By day 6 I was hospitalized with severe dehydration and exhaustion. Was immediately hooked up to an IV to replace fluids and was given anti sickness meds. Doctors introduced Effexor at a lower dosage (75mg) and devised a tapering plan. IÃ¢Â?Â?m extremely sensitive to this drug so am tapering slowly to avoid any more withdrawal symptoms. Currently on 18.75 mg (halved a 37.5mg pill). IÃ¢Â?Â?m almost free of this drug, canÃ¢Â?Â?t wait to have my life back!!!!!

Then my psychiatrist said to me ‘well if you think it does nothing try coming off it then!’. Of course I didnt try to come off it but I know that today,  it is 1 of my psychiatric drugs that I would go into an absolute panic  if I couldnt take it for a day.

This medication made me feel incredibly jittery! The way I felt is what I imagine a meth head feels like. My anxiety shot through the roof, my pupils were extremely dilated and I had dark thoughts. I had NEVER in my life have EVER thought or felt this way. This stuff was not for me! I had to get off of it after 5 day.  Don't freak out over my story, remember everyone reacts to these medications differently!! My aunt is on this one and at a higher dosage and she said it works amazing for her. So don't get discouraged!

29$Condition: Depression$8/1/2018 2:12:01 PM$Reviewer: Jess, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$2$5$When I started high school I had major anxiety and depression. I think this drug kept me alive during that difficult time in my life but it came with terrible side effects. I canâ??t remember a lot when I look back on those four years. My thoughts were kind of hazy and my body always felt weak and heavy. When I was finally ready to come off it it took me two and a half years to come off it completely. I experienced terrible withdrawals: tremors, weakness, mood swings, a weird electric shock feeling throughout my body, dizziness, exhaustion, fever, high heart rate. I am so glad that whole experience is over. I am greatfull that Effexor got me through it but if I could go back I would have tried other things first and maybe just turn to this as a last  resort.
30$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/5/2018 9:31:32 PM$Reviewer: RichWS, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I’m a 69 year old male with heart disease that required by-pass surgery in 1997. I started having panic attacks on 2010, although I didn’t know what they were at the time. The attacks got much worse after a heart attack in 2015. Symptoms included loss of appetite, nausea, shaking, headache and even dental pain. I was in the hospital three times for these symptoms over the past 4 years with no resolution. I finally went to the hospital in November 2017. I suspected these issues were anxiety related and a doctor offered me a prescription for 75 mg of Effexor (started with 37.5 mg for the first week).  Symptoms subsided fairly quickly over the first week and I had a good Christmas. It’s been seven months now and I’m feeling great. All symptoms are gone. I’ve been eating good, sleeping, good and have been very active outside, biking and doing yard work (retired in 2014). Still on 75mg. No significant side affects other a mild reduction in sexual activity. It’s definitely been very effective for me. Hope it keeps up.

It saved my sanity and probably my life. You need to take it around the same time each day. For me it levels my moods but sometimes I worry that maybe it just too level with no high or low just level. But it is my life changer to get me out of the severe depression! Thank you Effexor! I tried many others and they did not work for me. Effexor was the one that brought my life back to normal! I will probably be on it the rest of my life Iâ??m on 150 mg a day and have held steady the last 10 years! It works well for me! 
32$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/10/2018 8:19:33 PM$Reviewer: Noddy, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been on Effexor XRT for 3 months. I had been on another anti depressant which had stopped being effective for many years. While I feel Effexor has been excellent for stabilising my depression and mood the physical side effects are terrible. Constantly nauseous, lightheaded, dry mouth with horrible metallic taste in my mouth. Although I have recently had my eyes checked and my prescription changed my vision is not clear. This may be due to the medication or something else. I take a natural sleeping tablet at night otherwise I do not sleep. I do awake more refreshed and more prepared to meet the day. I will persevere for a bit longer. I am being monitored by my psychiatrist.

It is horrible, I don't have any emotions, I can not sleep, panic attacks are worse, my brain feels like its shaking out of my skull, nervous, and just feel like I am losing my mind. I was taking Zoloft and I am going back to it. Not for me. I am hoping that my withdrawal will not be so bad.
34$Condition: Depression$4/26/2018 9:00:32 PM$Reviewer: Adrienne, 19-24 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$I loved this medication. I was diagnosed with depression at around 10yrs old. I saw a pediatric psychiatrist for a few yrs and after trying multiple meds stayed on Effexor. I took a higher dose of 300mg but was on it for almost 15yrs before it quit working for me. My only complaint in the many years of using it was that if I forgot my pills 2 days in a row I was super physically ill. It made me outragously nauseous if I missed it more than 2 days in a row. If I missed it one day I was ok. Effexor worked amazingly for me and I'm super upset it no longer works but it was a life changer for me.
35$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/3/2018 4:50:19 AM$Reviewer: Josh, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I'm 38 male. Been taking Ativan daily for over 10 years to treat panic attacks and anxiety. All of sudden one day started having extreme disturbing thoughts and the Ativan was barely helping anymore. Miserable for about 6 months with this new strange anxiety/panic with crazy horrible thoughts was really creating a lot of despair in my life. Luckily and by the grace of God I found a deacon of my church that steered me to a really good psychiatrist. He prescribed me effexor xr 37.5 mg 2x a day. Initially no relief but after about 2 weeks slowly but surely I began to feel normal and not having any disturbing thoughts. What a blessing to feel at peace again. Wasn't even feeling much need for the Ativan anymore. Before the new anxiety/crazy thoughts started i was averaging .5 of Ativan a day and feeling fine for the most part. Then after I started having disturbing thoughts all of sudden and out of the blue (was on a trip driving out of town when it began). Anyways, it was disturbing me so much that I was taking anywhere from 2mg to 3mg of Ativan a day just to get by and was still feeling miserable and feeling I was at my breaking point almost entirely from morning til night. And now for over a month i felt normal almost 100 percent of the time. Reduced my Ativan down to 1mg a day and sometimes don't even feel the need for it. I take 37.5 mg in the morning and at night and my goal is to get off the Ativan all together and only being on the effexor. Thank God it helped me tremendously and I hope anyone that suffers from what I did can get the help and peace that I did! God bless and heal all who suffer with all mental illness!!

I experienced a prolonged period of depression. It begun with anxiety and all those 'lovely' attacks. I have been on Effexor for all that time. It works (only 75 mg for the past few years), but it concerns me that I have been on it for so long. My old brain (I'm now 58!) tells me if I've missed a daily dose with vivid, almost psychedelic dreams. Oh, and those really odd shocks to my physical self. Other than that, my sex drive is good, real good. I still drink and exercise a ton. You have to, right? I think this drug probably helped give me the wonderful life I am fortunate to be living.

51$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/2/2017 12:19:26 AM$Reviewer: Mortimer, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$When I was prescribed this medication I read the reviews and then got kinda nervous about taking it.  I decided to only take 1 x 37.5 mg per day. I was very nauseous the first 4 days.  Had a strange vacant feeling, kinda weak, stuck it out and most of the side effects went away.  The only bothersome one I have now is slight constipation.  Magnesium citrate and Metamucil are dealing with that.  I'm pretty sleepy after I take it in the am but coffee does the trick (and no longer turns me into a nervous wreck).  I am calmer, I can concentrate better, my sense of humor is back, I feel normal, like my old self.  I'm not anxious about silly things, but I'm also not a zombie.  My dr is fine with me sticking with the low dose.  I know this drug isn't for everyone, but it is working for me.

I have taken most SSRI meds, but Effexor XR 150mg has been the best by far. I rarely have panic attacks, and if I do, they are mild and controllable. My anxiety in general is low and I don't get depressed any more. I also don't have any side effects (only decreased appetite which isn't so bad!) I am able to perform a stressful, professional full time job without any problems. I intend to keep taking this forever. If it works, why try and stop it?! I have never been happier.

My libido isn't as strong as it has been in the past.  I have memory problems which may because by it.  Then again it may be due to depression so take that one with a grain of salt.

I was originally on a high dose then it went down to 150mg, then to 75mg and then to half of that, however, in the winter went back onto the 75mg dosage and have stayed on it ever since. When I was on 150mg or higher I couldn't even cry, I was very unemotional, but, at least at that time, I probably needed the high dosage. Happy with 75mg a day and also take Vitamin D with it since my test I am very low with regard to that.

I started on 75mg and stepped up to 150mg. After a few months doctor increased dosage to 225mg because worrying and paranoia were returning.  225mg worked awesome on my symptoms. It was so good not laying awake in bed, worrying about everything, thinking every whisper I heard at work was about me and feeling my blood pressure and heart rate rise, from the constant state of heightened alert required from my job.(Jailer) I stayed on this dosage for about a year and finally realized the side effects were not decreasing. The inability to orgasm, unbelievably excessive sweating (I had to change t shirts 6 hours into my shift at work) And the dreams! They seemed to last all night long and were so detailed and vivid and they seemed to continue from one night to the next!  It was almost like living another life while I slept. It became intolerable once these dreams started morphing into nightmares in which i would talk, cry and scream in my sleep (so says my wife, but I don't believe the crying part) and wake up sweating. I started taking a small dosage of welbutrin for my inability to orgasm (which I had no problem with, but my wife did). It didn't work.  Anyway, I had to quit because of the side effects, but the results for the intended purpose were incredible.  I am currently weaning off effexor and trying something else. Oh yeah!  I almost forgot the 3 to 4 days between bowel movements which culminated into an incredibly painful,humongous stool, when I finally was able to defecate! I mean really, really painful, to the point you doubt it would come out!  Another little bonus from this drug. But,hey, it worked so well, I will return to it if I can't find something better. Good luck!

If you do not have insurance this medication can be very expensive. So if you don't have insurance or can't keep up on refills I wouldn't recommend it because once you start you literally can not stop. If I forget to take my meds I get so sick I have to take it or if I run low and/or don't refill on time I am in the ER because I can't function. I get severe brain zaps, very dizzy, hot and nauseous. Besides depression I have borderline personality disorder and I feel this has really help with my impulsiveness and mood swings. I have been at my job the longest I have ever in my life, I have achieved goals I never would have otherwise and it has kind of helped with my alcoholism.

(Although those 2 weeks waiting were horrible, especially since I didn't know if it would do anything). 
What it's helped with: severe depression, severe anxiety, panic attacks, and that heightened startle reflex. 
Side effects I experience on 75mg: night sweats, occasional shakes (these have gotten less over time), and occasional nausea (again, less over time). There have also been some seriously vivid dreams/nightmares, but I've also got PTSD. *shrugs* Could easily be either."

Effexor has made me have more positive thoughts and just overall in a happy mood all the time. I like that when I forget to take it I feel a little weird and then it reminds me to take it. At some point I did feel reliant on the medicine almost like I was addicted to it. I have had little to no side effects taking this drug. I have noticed a twitch in my eye that comes and goes but that is nothing compared to the suicidal thoughts I was experiencing. I feel that it has strengthened my relationship with my boyfriend and family. I used to have a short fuse and snap all the time at people and not understand why I would get so mad at something so small. I honestly felt like I freak and a test patient after all the medicines my doctor had me try. Do not only listen to the negative effects of this medicine. Everyone's body reacts different to every medicine, what doesn't work at all for one person may be life changing for someone else. Trying different medicines to find the right one for you is completely normal.

It's been such a life-changer I'm actually concerned about possibly needing to go off it for an extended period of time when I, hopefully, try to conceive.

It is extremely difficult to get off of. I was on 150mg/daily and if I did not take it within 2 hours of waking I would get very dizzy. I became concerned about being on it so I weaned myself off (depression managed well over a year later now) and the ONLY way to do it is to literally count out the little beads and take just a few less every couple of days.

Although it worked well for me at 150 mg a day I developed a rash on my shins and severe constipation.  I began reading up on weening myself off of it and learned that there are severe side effects when trying to get off of it.  After lowering the dosage for the last 3 weeks, per my new doctor's instructions, I am now on my 4th day without it and agree with what I read about how difficult it is to stop taking this drug.  The brain spasms or zaps, disorientation, dizziness, nausea, headaches, sleepiness and generally not being able to function has been almost unbearable.  Thankfully, I have been off work for 4 days because I definitely would not be able to function at work.  All this after only about 5 months on this drug.  What really upsets me is that the doctor that prescribed this to me did not mention how bad the withdrawal symptoms would be when getting off of it. I have even read that some of the symptoms may be permanent for people that have taken this drug for an extended amount of time.  I am so glad at this point that I developed the rash and constipation so I was not on it for any longer.  I would HIGHLY suggest you think twice before starting this drug and can only hope my symptoms will subside with time.

I love that if I forget to take it that it makes me feel odd enough to realize I need to go take it but I can function if I can't get to it right away. I take it as soon as I can to relieve the fussy feeling and it does go away within the hour usually after taking it. I am like the old me, a social bug.

I was put on Effexor and have been feeling much better. I am aware of the side effects but similar to eating unhealthy (pizza, burgers, etc) you run the risk of high BP.  So instead of living a miserable life I decided to manage my anxiety, eat healthy, and exercise. Getting on a medication like this is forever so make sure you know that before going on. If your brain lacks the chemical balance unless all of your life problems are solved accept the fact that you may need medication to help live a happy life.

dosage.  No side effects at all.  Was very sad but noticed after about a month that things did not bother me as much.  It was very gradual.  Helped a lot.  No need to try to get off.  Why would anyone try to stop taking a medically necessary prescription?  If your brain has ceased making the necessary amount of serotonin to keep you stable, it is never going to get better.  You need to STAY on your meds.  People have caused their own problems by trying to stop taking meds on their own. Their doctors would have told them that if they had the sense to ask.  "

Patients should never wean themselves off their meds. You ARE NOT a doctor. Talk to your doctor or their nurse first and let them help you.
Anti-depressants affect everyone different. Remember these types of drugs are providing our brains with much needed chemicals it is missing or does not have enough of. Therefore they are going to affect me different than they will affect you. There are so many meds in our world these days that cause some serious side affects and some are worse than others. This should be part of your discussion with your doctor. Especially if you are already taking meds for some of the side effects or if there is a family history. Regardless, your doctor may still decide this is the best med for you."

After a few weeks I felt great and could return to my high stress job as a Flight for Life paramedic (a job I've loved doing for the last 15 years). The job takes a toll. I fly adults/kids hurt and dying every shift to trauma centers and ERs. I'm still going through medication dose adjustments. The two issues with the drug I have noticed are acne (cystic) breakouts on my face and a lack of a sex drive. Also, the healing time for breakouts, lacerations, and scratches seems prolonged. Neither is overwhelmingly bad but I'm hoping these issues will resolve. In the meantime I've been taking Spironolactone (an underused acne wonder drug) which helps. Before taking Effexor XR I had to sedate myself to leave the house. No way could I think of going to work without panic. This drug saved my sanity and career.

he told me he would help me..

My psychiatrist had me worked up to 225mg which I was told was the highest recommended dosage, and not too much longer after told me to take two pills, two times a day. This drug has ruined my life and turned me into a drug addict junkie and an awful person. This drug caused me to ruin many relationships in my life, caused multiple over doses and the biggest wake up call of my life. An overdose that put me into a coma for a week and the realization that years of my life were erased by the time I decided to become sober in 2013. It is now August 2015 and I am still obsessed with this drug. I have constant relapse dreams and vivid memories of how this drug made me feel that are destroying me, even though I have not taken this drug in almost 3 years.

It was ineffective for me until put on a ridiculously high dosage. When I reached this high dosage, I lost track of time, what day it was, where I was, I would pass out constantly wherever I was sitting, I couldn't react to emotions or feel emotional in the slightest (for ex. my friend committed suicide while I was on Effexor XR I could not cry - I felt completely and utterly numb). When I was being taken off this product I had severe withdrawl symptoms: seizing/spasming of my entire body, feelings of zapping/electrocution in the head, sounds of electric buzzing/zapping, nausea, headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, vomiting, periods of unconsciousness - I was bedridden for 5 days. Long-term side effects: uncontrollable twitches. I would never recommend this medication to anyone.

So far after 5 weeks I have insomnia, crazy dreams, and had thoughts of death and very dark mood.  I went to urgent care and the provider has me taking 75 mg until my PCP is back from vacation next week.  After one day of 1/2 dose I have an unrelenting headache, agitation, and no appetite.  I feel insane.  This drug (like all drugs) is poison to my system.  I'm sure it's helpful for others, but it doesn't work for my body chemistry.  I was hopeful.  The side effects are scary.

It may work for some, however I'm sure there is something better on the market that is far less addictive if you ever plan on coming off of it! 

I was prescribed this for anxiety/OCD and as far as how well it worked, I only noticed a slight difference. I felt a little less anxious, but it also made me completely numb to all other emotions too. Another side effect I noticed--I lost all of my sex drive.

When I found out I was pregnant, my doctor agreed that I should go off of this since it wasn't doing much anyway. This has proven to be a real nightmare! I took me 3 whole months to come off of it. For those of you who are struggling to come off of this now, I'll offer the method I used: 
I split open the pill, counted the ""beads"" into even amounts and took each amount for about a week until my body adjusted to it. Doctor's can prescribe lower dosage amounts, however, the jump from one dose to another may be too much of a shock to your system. For example, I jumped from the 150 mg I was taking to 75 mg, then started the bead counting to completely come off. That jump was pretty intense let me tell you!

So overall, any small effect I noticed from this pill really wasn't worth the pain of trying to get off of this nasty drug!"

I have tried almost every medication(s) available. Effexor XR is the only medication that allows me to function with the least side effects. I take 150 mg twice daily. I no longer have to keep xanax as a back up as I have been symptom free for many months. The only side effect I have had is headaches. The one concern is going off the medication. There was a point I could not get my Effexor refilled and after 3 days of being off it I was extremely sick. But once I got back on the medication I felt better within 3 hours. So it is important to wean off the medication if the treatment is stopped. Over-all, this medication was a life saver.

My mood and general feelings improved about 50 percent.  I still had sad days, but they were very rare.  I also take Lithium and Trileptal for my bipolar condition.  Went off Effexor for about 7 months and noticed negative feelings coming back strong.  Went back on Effexor with Doctor's supervision.  And added light therapy lamp (beginning October 2006)and they both worked well together. Hope this information helps someone.  Take care.  
148$Condition: Depression$12/16/2014 1:15:57 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$Effexor has been really good. I've had depression, PTSD, anxiety, and never wanted to take pills for it, but after a major upsetting event in my life, I pretty much had no choice and was forced into it by loved ones. Crappy time emotionally. But, I was SURPRISED by the results. It works. It doesn't make my life 100% amazing or even 75% and all problems go away instantly in any means, I get really sad still, but I can function. For anyone struggling to see improvement when taking anti-depressants, please don't give up. After my first drug didn't work, I was so done with it all but agreed to try ONE more time for something and it's working. There are so many anti-depressants out there...don't give up hope.
149$Condition: Depression$12/9/2014 6:08:40 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$3$I have been taking Effexor 150mg for over a year.  It really did seem to help at first. I was a lot calmer and less iritated.  i've also tried Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro,and Abilify(it worked but gained 40lbs-do not suggest).  The problem with this drug is it seems to put you into your own world and for me it made me less interested in going out into the world and having experiences with others. It also did have a decreased sexual effect on me.  I was still able to achieve orgasm, just was really not interested with having sex anymore-where as before i was really interested in it.  Now the icing on the cake-getting off of this drug-IMPOSSIBLE. I could tell if i was even a couple hours late in taking it because i would experience numbness in my face-extreme vertigo to the point of vomiting, cold sweats, horrible! i am tapering off of it now to try a new drug, Britellex.  If this doesn't work-i am just going to deal with depression!

Now I don't even think about it & I'm happy & socialble again! That's all great.But I had a heart attack in 2008 and now find out this drug is not good for me to take due to the possibility of having another heart attack.I am losing weight easily probably due to going out more for walks.I don't know what to do now after reading about the heart attack possibility? I also am sweating up a storm on this drug,but the relief it has given me is worth all the sweating & risks I suppose. At least I am living instead of staying indoors alone dying. I started on 37.5 mgs and tonight will begin 75 mgs. Anyone else taking this who's had a heart attack and is anyone else sweating ? Just curious? Thanks & good luck to everyone.

165$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/3/2014 5:38:18 PM$Reviewer: hellokatie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I started taking Effexor XR after trying Zoloft (caused 20 lb weight gain and intense dreams but did not help at all) and Xanax (which works amazingly well & I still take it as needed). I have always had GAD but started getting (what I eventually narrowed down to) panic attacks at age 21. I would feel extremely uneasy & lightheaded in public basically ALL the time and it made it hard to go places. I also had a few full blown panic attacks at home (all at night) and had myself convinced I was having a heart attack, would pass out in public, would have a seizure, etc. Along with all of these issues I would get heart palpitations which I had never gotten before. I have no other health problems besides hypothyroidism which is treated. I literally had no idea what was wrong with me and I always thought it HAD to be something besides anxiety because I have always had anxiety and when this started & continued to happen I was under less stress than ever. I was soo doubtful of this drug and assumed I would need xanax for the rest of my life and accepted it. I tried Effexor anyways, dubiously, and after 1 week I noticed an improvement. My lightheadedness started to clear up and since then I have had minimal to no issues. Felt like I got my life back. I have no side effects besides memorable dreams. I do sometimes get panic symptoms but I am only on 75 MG so I'm fine with it. But NO panic attacks since, and everything else if basically perfect. I am a 22 year old female of average weight & height and have been on the generic of Effexor successfully for about 5 months now. Oh - and I literally haven't needed Xanax since which was so helpful and necessary for my symptoms before. Thanks Effexor! 
166$Condition: Depression$8/2/2014 3:53:42 AM$Reviewer: SirGrumpy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$4$"I got brainwashed into a 1 year effexor treatment and it worked like a charm. 7 years of depression and anxiety simply vanished on the first pill. So did my interest in sex, erections, empathy and emotional depth, which were supposed to re-emerge after treatment so I didn't complain about it at the time. I also had an uncharacteristically positive disposition on the matter (high on serotonin) and I was afraid of going back to depression so I even passed down on the possibility of switching meds. When I consulted with the doc regarding going off the drug at the 1 year marker, he actually suggested prolonging treatment by another year since ""effexor is harmless"". I refused because the unexistent libido and cold erections were not something i was willing to endure for more than a year and i felt perfectly fine mood-wise. So, the doc told me to taper, I went cold turkey and through the typical withdrawal of hellish nightmares, dizzyness, brain zaps, irritability and inability to think for a week. One and a half year off the meds i got the empathy back... From my new psychiatrist that is, who keeps hearing about how my libido, erections and interest in activities are still far from normal and how his 3 colleagues which i previously tried to consult on the matter tried to force-convince me, first visit, that it's just me or i'm still depressed and effexor had nothing to do with it. He was sceptic at first and then stumbled upon some research which backed me up on the sexual stuff. He assumes that it's not permanent and has no idea on what to do to help, other than offer me some drug treatment(...), bear with my obsessive monologues of rage and regret and suggest alternative methods like acupuncture, which i haven't yet gotten around to trying due to procrastinating over the agonizing uncertainty. Mending a busted leg at the expense of an arm is hardly my idea of healing and a lifetime of unreasonable medication is simply unacceptable to me, so effexor and the like...NO!"

Yes the withdrawn symptoms, yes very difficult to get off the drug BUT you MUST tamper very very slowly. 
I learnt this and I am on and off this drug say once a year and/or when I want, here what I do...

From a health shop I buy some hawthorn herbs capsule (*I need the capsule to be empty*, so I put the hawthorn powder on my cereals –it is good for you, but sue that is not the topic)

Then if I started with 37.5, I open the capsule and divide the content in two>
Take for 5 days
Then>take 2 capsules 37.5 and divide the content in 3 capsule >take for 5/7days

Then you are at 37.5 (one original capsule) > take for at least 10 day (if you need to increase the dosage ...same fashion described, .. 
one 75 capsule, split in two and so on. 

AND TAKE NOTE WRITE ALL DOWN, TIME AND DOSAGE. If you use Effexor XR this way + cognitive therapy = The nightmare is over...live is fabulous again-;) (Well this is my experience anyway)

If you do not do this, yes all that bad stuff happens.
***Felling over optimist and a bit ...to happy. Write down a few notes and read them every morning, i.e. I am so confident because of the drug, don’t go overboard.

This is a great fabulous drug for anxiety/rage and depression.

PS: I have being in other antidepressants >same story.... get a pill cutter in the pharmacy.

Bottom line tampering may take you 3-4 months if you are taking it for 6-7 months, if you are taking for  1-2-3 years, you may need a year to go off WITH NO SIDE EFFECT....TAMPER THE INCREASE-DECREADE DOSE SLOWLY. (Quitting cold turkey...means pure madness do NOT do that).

PS. Tranquilizers ...CAREFUL the addiction is greater than the antidepressant

I felt fairly good about life, and ok about myself. Plus it helped me lose weight by controlling my appetite. 

However, after being on it for a year, I began to have suicidal thoughts. Well, suicidal everything to be exact. My thoughts started turning downward and my self esteem followed. All of a sudden I was considering not being here anymore, how the world would be a better place without me in it to keep on making disastrous mistakes (which wasn't how life really was, my thoughts were affected by the depression), and as each day passed, the thoughts and feelings of despair intensified. I've never had adverse reaction to anti depressants before and hope I don't again. I had to tell the doc and I changed medication, but the withdrawals that followed, were horrific for me. I was in a medically induced sleep for basically the most of 3 weeks, as when I was awake, without the buffer of the medication (whilst awaiting the new one to build up in my system), my thoughts and feelings were VERY raw, sad and painful. The suicidal tendencies were intense and I never want to experience them again. I don't know if I'd make it through another bout of it.

So after the three weeks, I came somewhat right, am on avanza now and need therapy every week. I miss the effexor due to the normalness I felt (and the appetite control - let's be honest!), but it wasn't for me in the long term."

However, I was negligent in take the meds for 2 days in a row (I was completely involved with something and just FORGOT)  I will never do that again.   The withdrawal symptoms I experienced were horrendous - involving vomiting, tremendous nausea and compared to the worst kind of flu I ever had.   I have taken measures to remind myself to take the medication so that I never experience that again.   P.S.   I have been on this medication for at least 10 years.

We tapered it down...but I never, never, never felt this horrible!  I went off this medicine with my doctors help....but I can't believe the withdrawal symptoms.  Had I known the withdrawal was like this, I would have never started effexor in the first place--yes, it helped, but NOTHING is worth feeling like this.  From now on, I will check if there are any withdrawal symptoms on ANY medicine I may be prescribed---still can't believe how bad the withdrawal is---and to think some people just go off this stuff???  Don't know how they do/did it!  If someone came to me today and said they were being prescribed Effexor~~I would honestly tell them to NOT start it---the side effects are not worth it, at least not in my opinion!

My first couple of weeks on this medicine I kept waking up too early in the morning (I take it in the morning). I also had nausea and appetite suppression. Those side effects went away after a couple of weeks. For the next six weeks I had a lot of difficulty orgasming... now it is still harder than it was before the medicine, but it's nothing terrible. Here's the good news: I am free from obsessive thinking! It's like the skies have opened up for me! Bad things still happen, but I feel like I have much more of a choice of how to respond!

Effexor has done wonders for me in both of these areas.  However, this drug is a wicked Catch-22 because it is nearly impossible to go off it. Don't let any doctors fool you into believing you might experience ""minor withdrawal symptoms"".  This drug is evil when it comes to trying to get off the medication.  It is almost a guarantee that you will experience major nausea and flu-like symptoms, dizziness, ""brain zaps"" or what feel like jolts of electricity shooting through your head, and major disorientation.  I have been trying to get off of this medication for over a year with no success.  My doctor tried to taper me off by substituting Prozac every other day, but that does not work at all.  I'm still on 37.5mg and cannot figure out what to do.  All the while, these doctors act like it's no big deal to go off this drug.  They have no idea what they're talking about unless they have experienced it themselves.  If you Google ""Effexor Withdrawal"" you will find hundreds of message boards with people complaining that they can't get off this medication.

I was diagnosed with Panic Attack/Anxiety Disorder in April 1997, and I've been taking 1 mg of Xanax - currently, and for 10 years or more - three times a day.  While Xanax has worked well for me, I cannot say the same for the anti-depressants that I was prescribed as an aid in treating anxiety without raising the daily dose of Xanax.

I've taken Prozac, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin over the years, and in the the last 3 years, Effexor ER tablets. for 1 of those years I took 225mg ER a day.  This is the worst anti-depressant I've ever taken, and I will not take it again.

It's taken me 6 months to finally get off Effexor safely, by tapering doses per week in several phases until I stopped taking it. Because I did it this way, I managed some of he horrible withdrawals many have endured tapering or stopping with this medication.

This was the best decision I've made since convincing myself to see a psychiatrist all those many years ago. It is a debilitating drug that was largely ineffective - it's also expensive, and it comes with serious withdrawal symptoms."

Effexor was my last attempt at antidepressants. I've been on a relatively low dose of 75 mg. Used it for approximately one year. Like the other meds, Effexor did next to nothing to improve my depression or alleviate anxiety, except causing me to cry less (instead feelings are bottled up inside) and diminishing my libido. The main difference between Effexor and the other brands is much worse withdrawal symptoms. I've been following my doctor's instructions for weaning off the medicine for three weeks, still I experience debilitating dizziness and what feels like small electric shocks to the brain. Constantly. A truly horrible drug. Can't wait to get it out of my system.

Overall I think it was easier for others to be around me and a good drug of choice for the time.

Undesirable side effects:  still had libido, but reduced orgasms to zilch...main reason for going off this drug.  Realistic nightmares the first year or so which diminished over time.  Extreme yawning and felt groggy always.  Dry mouth (which I think is a side effect of most anti-depressants).  A missed dosage (which seldom happened) would make me feel very light-headed and woozy.  Be sure to follow your Doctor's recommendations for changes in dosage (increase or decrease).

Was off Effexor XR for about 9 months. Sex life improved 500%.  Energy level improved and gave me motivation to exercise and lose about 20 lbs.  Other than that, everything irritates me and I am not easy to be around (type A perfectionist that I am).  Back to my MD today.  Am going to try Lexapro."

I had started on 75mg the 3 years on have been up to 225 mg.  My moods still swing quite a lot and still have the need for constant counselling.  I would rate around a 8/10 for effectiveness but I am just about to change to a different brand and one thing that I will say is trying to get off Effexor  whatever the dosage may be is extremely hard.  If I had my choice over again I would have went with a less addictive one.  If you miss one day you will feel terrible until you have it in your system.

Then I was executor and power of attorney for my mother's will.  Next a step-daughter-in-law and my stepson disowned me and I can't see my granddaughter, then my daughter-in-law took something I said the wrong way...HUGE misunderstanding.  I have just sent off an apology card and a little ""Hope"" angel, hoping we can go back to being such good friends.  I went to Mexico for my late brother's daughter's wedding end of April 2013.  My sisters all partied on their own and left me out.  Ate most meals alone, went to pool alone, etc.  Left phone messages for them to call me when they were going into town which I really wanted to do.  They never called me.  I had a meltdown there.  It was hard enought to go through the wedding without my brother, but this made it ten times worse.  My heart is broken into many pieces.  My husband is very depressed and stays in bed most of the time.  I feel like a widow.  I feel alone in a crowd.

I have been on it for over 10 years. There are two downsides to it though. First, it will give you the weirdest dreams you ever had...some can be very scary, but I got used to them...second thing is that it is EXTREMELY addictive. I tried to come off of it several times befor, weaning my-self off of it very slowly and carefully with my doctor....no way at all. I just couldn't do it at all. You will have extreme withdrawal symptoms...feeling like you have the flu like chills, muscle weakness, throwing up non stop during the day, extreme anger, brain zaps like you are having mild seizures but yet you are awake so, it is a very good medication but very difficult to quit. I just have to live with it I guess...

I think it helped a bit when I was dangerously depressed (sleeping 20 hours a day, abusing Ambien, not eating).  I was hospitalized for three weeks where they force fed me Effexor.  I felt obliged to cooperate.  I left as bad or worse off than I entered.  I just said the words that got me out and immediately went back to sleeping and taking my remaining ambien.  What saved me was when I ran out of Ambien and had to go back to work to survive.  Very supportive people there kept me going.  I stayed on Effexor (150 mg) daily, but rehabbed myself by walking eventually up to two miles every day.  I experienced blurred/cross eyed vision early on.  That got better.  I also had a lot of confusion which eventually improved.  Shaking eventually improved with other meds.    What got me was body pain like someone had tackled me.  Each day I would wake up with a bad back and drowsiness.  I blamed it on Trazadone and other drugs, but got no relief when I quit them.  On my last appointment my doctor (very nice man) upped my meds to 225mg.  That was the last straw.  I never filled the new prescription, but getting off it was easier said than done.  I experienced dizziness, headaches, a fuzzy headedness and confusion after a day or two.  My 150 came in capsules so I couldn’t split it up.  I finally tried opening the capsule and pouring the little beads out.  I took half one day and half the next and I’m feeling pretty good.  I’ll re-evaluate in a week or two.  My body ache seems to have improved.  All in all I’m feeling the best I have in months.  All this has taken place over the past six months.

If a doctor or shrink ever tells you that withdrawal is easy and you just taper off gradually, they have no idea what it's actually like to go off this drug.  I honestly think it should be taken off the market or reviewed by the FDA.  It also made me gain about 15 pounds and I only take 37.5mg.

After getting on the correct dosage, which ended up being 225mg for me, I felt like my old self again. It's not a ""happy pill"" but simply allows me to feel the emotions of everyday life. I laugh like I used to before my depression, and yet can feel sad and cry at times when it would be typical to feel that way. Before this medication, I was just crying all the time - for no apparent reason. Other meds have caused me to feel NO emotions at all. Yes, the weight gain of about 15 pounds was frustrating but I could also do more to lose it. I do sweat more as well. I have only missed one dose and there were very minimal side effects which I was expecting - headache, some tingling when I moved my head suddenly.  When I told my doctor these side effects, he asked me if it was worth taking.......ABSOLUTELY. I know it isn't for everyone but for me - I'm just fine with it. I have my life back again."

It gets rid of my depression, but I would rather keep sleeping than get up for anything.  I don't care if I clean anymore. I have no drive.  I don't go to the gym.  I'd rather feel a little lonely than miss the gym.  Can't lose the rash.  Totally hate the doctor who conned me into taking this.  Immediate gratification, but persistent side effects.  A rash for 2 weeks for no reason after dosage doubled.  I have skin allergies.  I know what is causing my rash.  Wish I never took this horrible medicine.  It should be removed from the market.  Ready for a law suit soon, surely.  I should have listened to other user's complaints and never have gone on this dug.

It was given to me whilst I was in hospital and didn't really care about what was going on.  I've since tried to stop but the side effects became unbearable.  Had I been told, I would never had agreed to start taking them.  Beware people in relationships, the first thing to go is your labido.

I was always so tired so I took it at night but that didn't help. I am sensitive to medications and the withdrawls for Effexor were HORRIBLE. I didn't just stop either. I took a lower dose for a week then another lower dose for a week then half a dose for a week and so on. I was so sick. I was throwing up for 2 weeks and so sick for a month. I could hardly get out. I felt like little electrical shocks would zap my head. It's so hard to explain but I thought maybe I was wrong. I started reading other peoples experiences too and they were the same. My friend also had bad withdrawls and had to get back on it because she couldn't function at work. DON'T go with this one, try another one.

The only thing I don't like about this medication is if I miss only one dose, by the middle of the day I start having electrical feelings all through my body and my head feels like it is swelling.  All I have to do is take my missed dosed and in a couple of hours I'm OK.  I really can't complain because this medication has really helped me over the years.  I'm a 2005 breast cancer survivor and Effexor XR was the best drug to be on during and after my treatments and medication I was on for continued treatment for my cancer over the following 5 years.
307$Condition: Depression$7/30/2013 1:01:54 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$1$1$This drug will ruin your life. I've been on 150mg for a few years. If you forget a daily dose the withdrawals are terrible. A medication prescribed to patients dealing with bipolar disorder who sometimes have trouble remembering should never have built in, sickening withdrawals if you miss one daily dose. If you take this pill, you'll be at risk of heatstroke on 80 degree days if you're in the sun too long. You'll have high blood pressure that you didn't have before, too. I'm a recovering cocaine and crack addict (7 years clean) and the withdrawals from Effexor XR make coke/crack withdrawals seem like a case of the sniffles. Unlike street drugs, the longer you go without Effexor XR in your system, the more the withdrawals make you think you're dying. The makers of this drug and those who prescribe it are evil people only concerned with their financial bottom line and keeping patients unwillingly hooked on their product.

Wasn't taking for depression but feel a little depressed now from missing feeling so good all the time and how well I slept when on it. (after a lifetime of insommnia) Any drug has a downside but honestly I don't see where all the negative comments are coming from. It does work but if anyone is hoping to find an AD with no side effects, they are going to be disappointed.  It is a chemical after all.

Effexor XR is a wonder drug for panic disorder. I take 225mg/day. I have been on it for approximately 14 years. It's great for panic but does not help greatly with agoraphobia.

The worst were: nausea, overactivity after taking the drug (what I imagine ADD must be like), complete loss of sex drive, sleeplessness, elevated body temperature (much more prevalent at night than during the day), alternating constipation and diarrhea (during the first month), among others.

I highly recommend trying Pristiq instead. It worked for me for over a year, but after my insurance dropped it I figured I would try something new. Huge mistake. I would rather pay top dollar for Pristiq than next to nothing for Effexor XR."

The 5 star reviews are just INCOMPLETE reviews, that in time will show this nasty drug for what it is. 7 years on 150 mg. Effexor xr, things were okay, at this point my review would have been positive. Sooo I no longer felt I needed or wanted to take this""medicine"" due to the many, many side effects. I had experienced the negatives 4 hours after my regular scheduled dose... headache would become a migraine with sweating and soon I would be vomiting. so I decided to ween off the pills slowly. My doctor takes me from 150 mg. to 75 mg. I think I can handle it, I was wrong. After 5 months of hell I'm trying to figure out what to do next...

I was put on this medication for social anxiety disorder about ten months ago. Initially when I first started taking the medication I only had one side effect of dry mouth which subsided after about three days. It took about two weeks before the medication started to show affect. Prior to taking Effexor XR I had extremely poor concentration at work, mixed emotions and issues with social anxiety. Effexor XR did help my concentration a lot. It helped settle my emotions and I began to not care too much about things (in a good way). It didn't really help with social anxiety and I didn't expect it too either. About two months ago I decided I wanted to stop the medication because my fiance and I are would like to start a family within the year. Basically I just wanted to medication free. At first I just went cold turkey and that is a very BAD IDEA. I was nauseous, tired and I had very severe brain zaps. To wean myself off the medication the second time, I tried something different, after reading a few others recommendations. I opened the capsule and took out 5 ""balls"" for the first day, 10 the next and so on until there was only 5 left. This took a few weeks and I had no withdrawal symptoms apart from very minor ""brain zaps"". It has now been four days since my last capsule and I feel great I am so happy to be off this medication and If I had known now what I know I would never have started taking it in the first place.  (I also gained 10kg on this medication too). I know everyone is different but I just wanted to share my experience. "

I have been on any natural supplement you can think of, Prozac, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and Lexapro. Lexapro helped for a while but stopped working after about 4 months. Prozac stopped working after about 6 months. Zoloft made me act and feel like a zombie. Wellbutrin made me suicidal (even more than I was. I also tried the Effexor immediate release tablets but it made me sick to my stomach and I couldn't tolerate it anymore. I was on it for 6 weeks and the side effects never went away, so I had to stop taking it.

If I took the drug even five minutes later than normal, I would vomit. If I took the drug without enough to eat, I would vomit. The sickness was accompanied by sweating, shivering, and weakness.

Going off the drug was akin to a heroin addiction. Visual hallucinations. Lucid dreams. Lucid nightmares. Stomach pains so bad that I blacked out. Sweating. Nausea. Dizziness. Extreme weakness. Panic attacks. Off the chart anxiety.

That being said, I would like to point out that this was after a few years of taking the drug. It did work for a time and I remember thinking that I felt better (this was paired with therapy sessions).

I also did not wean myself off of the drug. Once side effects started I stopped taking it. This was a mistake. My symptoms may have been greatly reduced if I had weaned off of this instead of going cold turkey.

I have had friends that have had similar experiences with this medication. I have also had friends that have had great experiences with this medication.

It is all a matter of your body and your reaction to medications. Sometimes you have to try a few before finding the one that is right for you. It is a journey. Good Luck."

I found it helped me focus better and I felt generally more happy. After about six months I decided to come off this medication as my partner and I have been considering having a baby so I want to be medication free and start preparing myself. I am now on 37.5mg and have been for the past 4 days.. So far so good. I havent' had any sid effects except for slight nausea on day 2 of 37.5mg but I just ate a decent sized dinner and it passed. I found if I had missed one dose of the 75mg I would get very nauseous and feel so terrible, I could not function at all. This only happened once thank goodness. Overall I would say this medication just helped clear my fuzzy mind and I could function better at work, I don't think it helped with regards to the social anxiety. I have gained about 4kg in the six months but whether this is related to the medication or not i am unsure :) Hopefully weaning off this medication won't be as difficult as some others have described. Fingers crossed!

Almost from the beginning my dose has been 375 mg per day. One reason that I am taking less now is that my Rx is running out, I've no refills, and am in a new city without any MD. I will rectify that soon.  
     With the lower dose I seem OK although I want to know that I have the medicine on a steady dosage, without hoarding it or worrying about my prescription running out. Also, some people find stopping the use of this drug to be difficult.
     Other than those considerations, I am amazed that the drug went to work quickly and still works to keep me reasonably sane. I am not at all outgoing so it is hard for me to live in society and have a reasonably happy life. Effexor seems to help me and I know I feel better than I ever did without it. My brain chemicals and life experiences have been at war with my feelings of hope and happiness for the majority of my life, but this medicine is helping me out now. "

It pretty much made me lifeless...no emotions, no feelings, just there. Not even a year past when I learned ways to cope with the anxiety attacks, tried to ween off this medication and ended up freaking out because I could not stand how sick I became. I had brain 'zaps' that would not subside and felt like a basket case. I immediately took a pill and felt great after 2 hours. Talked with my dr about trying it again and he suggested dropping the dose this time and for a few days I felt horrible with the brain 'zaps' and just generally miserable. This time though it subsided so I tried the next step which again made life impossible to live. I was in bed for a few days before I starting taking taking the normal does again. Finally after 2 years and a dr who I felt would not help me get off this medication I was able to quit cold turkey from the lowest does. It was awful. I was sick for a week straight before I learned that benadryl relaxed everything so the brain 'zaps' would disappear as long as I took it. I have never felt better and really wish I had looked up the withdrawal side effects for this drug. Some people get it worse than others and it can last up to weeks. It took 5 weeks before I was able to stop taking the benadryl. If you are taking this for a short-term please reconsider it took 2 years for what should have been only a few months.

Went to the MD to do something about the Effexor because all in all, I don't believe there are enough studies out to show if it is safe  to take while pregnant and the MDs I have talked to seemed to think this as well.  I am on day three of being off Effexor.  Not fun!  Luckily, I had some planned days off of work (I work as a nurse) and am glad I'm doing this away from work.  From what I have been reading, the side effects will go on for another week or two.  I feel nauseated, ill, just do not feel good in general.  I'm on 20mg of Prozac now, which has been proven to be safe to take while pregnant.  Just want to get this Effexor withdrawal done, so over feeling ill.  People on here call them ""brain zaps"", which is what it feels like in your head, withdrawing from this drug.  I just can't wait to be done with it.  I had a crying spell this morning, luckily have an understanding husband who helped me through it.  I don't feel I can concentrate as well without the Effexor and feel my moods are up and down one minute to the next.  I plan to go back on the Effexor after we have our baby. "

The anxiety would keep me awake at night and after weeks with only a 2 to 4 hrs of sleep at night, I went to see a doc.  we tried a few other meds to help me sleep before trying any anxiety meds.  The sleep meds either didn't help or kept me drowsy all day.  we switched to a few anti-anxiety meds then settled on Effexor.  It resolved the anxiety issues and the sleep problems.  However, I experienced, what I characterize, severe sexual dysfunction, reduced sexual desire, headaches, loss of appetite for several weeks, then increased appetite, constipation and chronic sleepiness.  I would describe the sleepiness as almost like narcalepsy.  I lost energy and had little desire to do anything.  Finally, I ""forgot"" to take a dose.  I had terrible nightmares that night and difficulty staying asleep.  I had even more significant headaches the next day, horrible dizziness - it felt like I was withdrawing from cocaine or something.  That was enough.  I just stopped taking it.  After a few days, I feel normal again with a significant increase in energy.  My advice:  stay away from these drugs!  Don't get hooked!  You should find out what triggers the anxiety/panic attacks and increase physical activity.  Eat better and learn to relax!"

I am sick of meds. I didn't think too much of it because I
did the same with a mood stabilizer last fall-cold turkey.
I've never been suicidal but main stream depression seems to a classic part of my personality. To have on-going chronic pain for years wears a person down. Loosing family members to cancer over & over doesn't help, either. So, off I go to a doctor about 8 yrs ago, per husbands suggestion. Fast forward to today. I stopped the Effexor-300 mg & now I'm not sure what to do. Go back on it? I won't call my doctor. What I really want is to get off it plus Zopiden & Xanax. I need my thyroid med, of course. I haven't smoked or had a drink in over 14 yrs. Trying to do the right thing has now become a nightmare. Sleep-aid? ADDICTED. Plus, I take 200 mg over the counter sleep aid along with the Zopiden each nite. And, I pray. I would joke, even as a teen 50 yrs ago that my glass was always 1/2 empty. Nothing's changed. I now have flu-like symptoms. Sad part-even while on the meds, this last yr I've stayed in bed about 75% of the time.
I'm not high energy, never was. Don't let people tell you to
JUST GET UP. My extended family thinks I'm lazy. Now I'm facing 2 more surgeries. I learned the hard way to keep my mouth shut, pretend all is well so not to drag family down. This is not a pity party. This is my life. Are there others that can understand me?"

I do not know why the doctor prescribed Effexor to help with my fainting spells but Effexor seemed to help.  My problem was not while I was taking Effexor because I had no problems while I was taking Effexor.  I was up to 225mg per day.  I had been taking Effexor for six years - then I decided it was time to wean myself off of Effexor.  This is when the problems started.  If you are trying to wean yourself off of Effexor - PLEASE BE CAREFUL!!!  I initially set a goal of one year to stop taking Effexor.  I was able to wean myself off in six months.  I think six months was too fast!  The withdrawl symptoms associated with Effexor are/were very serious for me.  I experienced severe ""brain shivers"" or ""brain zaps"" as some people call them.  It felt like my brain was being ""zapped"" by a nine volt battery every few minutes or hours.  I also experienced very severe depression.  I had never been diagnosed with depression before but I could tell what it was when I was trying to get off of Effexor.  I could not just stop taking one of the 35mg pills and then cut back on another 35mg pill.  My body and mind could not take the shock.  The capsules have  about 80 to 90 little micro-pills in them (I don't know what else to call them).  I had to open my capsule every day and take out one micro-pill from the capsule each day.  I did this for many months.  Sometimes I had to stop lowering my dose and ""level off"" for a week or two until my body got used to the lower dose.  Then I began lowering the dosage one micro-pill at a time until I had to level off again.  Every day it felt like a psychological torture.  It was horrible.  I felt like committing suicide many times.  My ""brain zaps"" were unbearable.  I did take cannibis I was able to get from a friend and that helped my symptoms a little bit.

I was so depressed that I was crying all the time.  Effexor helped immediately with very little side effect.  However, if I missed a dose, I became extremely ill.  The worst side effect was brain zaps, like little electric shocks.  I decided to stop taking Effexor because of the side effects and it was hell to stop.  I started at 150 mg per day, weaning down to 35 mg per day.  I truly worried for my mental state as I detoxed this drug.  I have never been suicidal, but did feel hopeless and overwhelming sadness.  I had two panic attacks and raged/cried nonstop for several weeks.  I took double doses of Omega3 which really helped with the brain zaps. I have been off the Effexor for a little over a month now and feel that it is mostly out of my system.  I think this is a dangerous drug and should not be taken without full knowledge of the side effects, particularly when decreasing the dose.  I have been telling everyone I know to stay away from this medication.  I now understand why people can become suicidal from antidepressants.

397$Condition: Depression$1/18/2013 11:30:29 AM$Reviewer: tagAught, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$2$"I went on Effexor XR for depression, because my insurance company would not pay for Cymbalta. My doctor started me off on a program to ease into it by slowly cutting down my dose of Cymbalta and increasing my dose of Effexor. I ended up on 150mg, but the week after that had terrible headaches. The doctor increased my dose to 300mg.
For the next 4 months, I experienced terrible, migraine-like headaches, and quite frequent hot spells (I'm only 36, not going through menopause yet). The headaches lasted for days at a time, and forced me to use up my sick days from work because of it.
I have Asperger's - an Autism Spectrum Disorder. I found out in the middle of December that Effexor is *contraindicated* for anyone with ASD. So I came off Effexor (entirely) and went back on Cymbalta. During the first week after that, I had two of what I called ""Effexor headaches"", but they lasted only the one day, up until I fell asleep at night. There have been no other withdrawal side-effects for me; I suspect that the Cymbalta has been cushioning them."

The Effexor has really done a number on me. I feel more depressed because I have to take it than I do about my crazy life circumstances. I have had suicidal thoughts regularly while on the full dosage. I decided about 2 months ago to taper off my dosage starting with a 10mg reduction each day (opening the capsule and removing the granules which when counted are right at 150 total). By the 5th day, or 120mg I was a basket case. I decided to Try a different approach. I would remove 5mg making my 7 day intake 145mg. I would then do another week at 140mg, then the next week at 135mg and so on. This has worked. UNTIL last night. I had the single most Terrifying night in my almost 45 years of living. For starters, I take Ambien because I can’t sleep. It didn’t help at all last night. I landed in some weird state of mental being about an hour after laying down. I could not move. My eyes were closed and It took all I could do to open one eye, my right one. I was super-hyper aware of everything surrounding me, My 8yr old on one side, my wife on the other, their breathing, my heartbeat, the dripping faucet, the sleepless stepchild in the other room. It was as if I could hear the air move. I found myself plunged into sheer terror. It was as if everything I have ever read was presenting itself all at once in a barrage of information overload with letter and numbers mixed in no intelligible arrangement. I felt as though I was being immersed in this swirling craziness as if attached to a slingshot being thrust into the mayhem and jerked back out again. I was awake but had no control of anything, my thoughts or body. I could not form words to speak. I could see through my closed eyelids as though I had night-vision goggles on. A heaviness beyond description had settled on me. It passed around 3am. I was looking at the ceiling until 5:30. . I am struggling with the thoughts of this medicine and its death grip on me.

I coulld hardly walk and was crying every night.  I asked several doctors if the terrible pain and swelling I was experiencing could be from the effexor and they all said no.  When all of my bloodwork came back fine I stopped taking it and within 3 days I finally feel like myself again.  I just want everyone out there to know that if they are experiencing terrible joint pain and swelling it could definitely be from effexor xr.

Advice for those who want to stop: Try following suggestions of the website ""The Road Back,"" a nonprofit organization that specializes in getting people off this type of medication. Omega 3 complex (fish oil) mellows brain zaps for me and for the first time I have been able to reduce the dosage. Down to to 37.5 after taking 150 for nearly 9 years. Will quit for good in a week.

I had a terrible time with the drugs I tried, namely Zoloft and Paxil. I had some success with Wellbutrin, until I started having terrible panic attacks and depersonalization. I swore never to use any medications ever again to treat depression, until I entered a treatment facility and my doctor insisted I try Effexor. 

I am so glad I did. Effexor has been a miracle drug for me. I never thought I would find a drug that was so helpful. In the first few weeks I did experience some nausea and other small side effects, but then I just felt...better. I felt happier and more comfortable. After a few months of taking it, I even noticed that my anxiety and panic attacks had become almost non-existent, something I never thought possible. I still get depressed from time to time, but it is far more manageable and not overwhelming. 

I have noticed that even when I miss just a few doses (like when I forget to refill a prescription for a few days) I do get pretty horrible withdrawal symptoms. Obviously I'm not looking forward to going off this drug for good. 

But for now, I'm feeling great. For anyone out there struggling to find the right drug, don't give up! I thought all anti-depressants were evil until I found the right one for me. I now believe that since all our brains are different, everyone just needs to find the drug that works best for their brain."

I'm coming off it, I absolutely hate it. The worst part is the confusion and sex drive.inability to orgasm.

I have been on Effexor XR 225mg/a day for 4 months. I maxed out on Zoloft previously with no improvements, but Effexor has been a great change. I have much fewer episodes of panic attacks and crying spells. The downside is that when I've missed doses, I have had the worst episodes ever. I cried so hard I was gagging and coughing and wanted to die. Anyway, I just set an alarm on my phone for pill time so I don't forget. 

Also, I would like to note that I have recently been prescribed a drug called Nerontin that I take 3x daily in conjunction with the Effexor. It's been a life changing drug. I have taken so many different things to manage my anxiety, and this one removes all the tension. It kind of makes me feel drunk and a lot more talkative. It really helps with my severe social anxiety. 

But I digress, Effexor is great for controlling my depression mainly and works better to control anxiety only at higher doses. 

I would also like to say that I read other peoples reviews, and some talked about the withdrawal symptoms. If a drug is really helping you, why would you stop? Depression and anxiety are very real diseases much like high blood pressure or diabetes. People with high blood pressure or diabetes do not stop taking their meds that keep them alive so why would you? Mental illnesses do not go away. Psychiatric drugs only help to manage symptoms, and they are not a cure.

Bottom line, I will take this drug for the rest of my life. I have come to accept that I am sick, but will do everything in my power to be strong and in control of my life. I cannot imagine the puddle of misery I would be without it."

I had tried so many other meds for depression with good results, but become resistent after taking them a good amount of time. Dr ""didn't know"" what else to give me. I had a friend who was in fulll blown Major Depression and was prescribed Effexor and after 2 weeks she was a different person; in control of her emotions, depression, a complete 360 degrees of how she was. So I told my dr this story and he put me on Effexor 150 mg 1X per day.  This seemed to work wonderful after days of getting into my system. About a yr after taking it, I noticed my depression getting worse. Dosage was upped to 300 mg. 1X in am and have been doing well on this. Still have bouts of depression, but these are situational. I did not  have any side effects that I noticed, but am not one to ever really get side effects from meds. All in all, I feel that Effexor XR is a great anti-depressant compared to some of the others I've been on; Prozac (stopped working when I was forced to got from name brand to generic fluoxetine and bombed out, lost job) trazodone which I took over 10 years ago for depression which did not work and now prescribed for sleep (loses effectiveness after years of taking), Lexapro which was like candy and did nothing, and a couple others, I can't even remember their names.  Effexor works. If you get side effects, give them a few days to work themselves out, don't give up on Effexor.  It changed my life to one I can tolerate at least 85% better than before!  My friend was able to go off Effex as her depression was situational and when she changed her situation, she was able to go off Effex, by tapering it down.  NEVER STOP A MED COLD TURKEY>of course you'll get side effects of stopping it all at one time!  Let doctors taper you on and off meds, do not think you can do it yourself!

I didn't want to take an anxiety drug, and effexor really didn't help until I reached the minimal clinical dose of 150 mg/day.  Had to take Extended time release; immediate release made me sick to my stomach.  For me, this med has been VERY effective in restoring chemical/good hormone imbalance caused by my constant pain.  I do notice that missing a dose (once daily) I become more irritable, but get back to ""normal"" shortly after taking pill.  The benefits of this med OUTWEIGH the RISKS.  If your doctor didn't walk you through the side effects, get a different doctor.  Ultimately it's your body, your decision.  This med correct a chemical imbalance in your brain, so you are naive to think you won't experience problems if you just stop taking this med.

439$Condition: Depression$10/8/2012 9:26:02 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$1$5$After being on this for a few years, if I missed a dose, I felt as if I could feel my blood running thru my veins. I would cry over any little thing and my emotions were a wreck. I did not like being 'dependent' on this drug and wanted off of it. My doctor did not agree, so I asked him to gradually lower the mg. I am finally off of it completely and would not advise this to anyone that could possibly avoid it.
440$Condition: Depression$10/8/2012 4:02:10 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I've dealt with depression since around 12 years of age.  I was told I may have a chemical imbalance at age 16.  At 19, I tried Prozac but didn't stay on it.  Then I tried Lexapro, Paxil CR, Cymbalta, all prescribed by family doctor.  I eventually had a breakdown at age 23 after being off Cymbalta for 6 months and had a psychiatrist start me on Effexor 150mg. It changed my life.  My relationships with others improved, I became an RN, bought my first house and married my love.  I will be 30 soon.  I started Paxil 12.5mg a year after starting the Effexor because depression was still getting me and the combination of the two has worked great for me.  I worry about getting pregnant while on these drugs.  I have discussed this with my family MD and psychiatrist both and both say they should be fine for me to take while pregnant.  The biggest complaints I have about these two meds is sweating at night when sleeping, low sexual desire and possible slow weight gain over the years (but that can't be proved to be the drugs).  DO NOT stop antidepressants on your own or taper off of them on your own. Take Effexor at the same time every day.  Just a few hours of being late with my med causes extreme irritability, dizziness, panic and if waiting too long, sobbing uncontrollably thinking you will die, even though you know it was the med withdrawal.  And it takes a few hours for it to kick back in.  I advise to see a psychiatrist for mental illness, not just your family MD.  Except for a few side effects that I've decided I can live with, this drug changed my life and helped me accomplish my life goals.  I think more clearly, can handle stress and don't worry unnecessarily.  I am not emotionless and live a happy and healthy life.  The next step is figuring out if Paxil and Effexor are safe to take while pregnant.  So far, I think I may taper off the Paxil before becoming pregnant but stay on the Effexor.  Not sure but will discuss with my doctors and post how I deal in the future.

I did need to add an anti anxiety specialty drug recently. My adult son also took Effxor. He gained weight, and had low sex drive so w/ help from doc tapered SLOWLY(key), including taking apart caps and dividing beads to mimimize side effects. He was put on welbuterin and a non-addictive anxiety med and is doing very well. The key to getting off Effxor with the least amount of side effects is lowering very small amounts at a time.

I'm not totally over all of my anxieties but I feel like I now control it and not it controlling me.  I also can notice when I forget to take my medicine.  It's not a good thing to forget.  I've become extremely ill by the time I realize I forgot to take my meds.  I also notice that I tend to cry alot and become easily angered on day when I'm late taking my medicine.  It truly has helped to keep me balanced and sane.  I don't think I could ever come off of this medicine and the truth is I would never want to because it really works.

It does help tremendously with my anixety.  However, I feel my brain chemistry must really be off balance.  Because Effexor 75 mgs makes me not want to eat and I LOSE WEIGHT!!!! Which is actually and very good plus for someone who has battled their weight all there life.  Withdrawel symptoms are very weird for me.  I have a few, like extreme anxiety, heart palpatations.  But I also have numbness of the face..and I feel ""High"" which I kinda like.  The worse part of Effexor is being very careful about taking drugs that cause interactions.  I took some wellbutrin (not prescribed for me) because I was going through withdrawels and caused a psychotic episode...SO BE CAREFUL WITH INTERACTIONS.."

I was extremely satisfied for years. In fact, I felt normal. However, in the past 3-4 years my body has started changing and I finally realized it is the medication. My worst long term side effect is memory loss/ short term. I forget if I have taken it or not. Either way, those effects are horrendous. I have been experiencing double vision, pain in my bones and headaches. I do have other changing effects, but those are my most severe. I have decided to take a different approach. I already exercise regularly.I am changing my entire diet. Gluten free (wheat, barley, malts etc.) and Casein free (dairy), have worked tremendously for our son with asperger syndrome. I am going to let my adjust to this way of eating. In about a 8- 12 mos, I will attempt to come off this drug. I have already experienced the brain zaps and hallucinations and so forth from missing meds. I know what I am in for and not looking forward to it. I have no choice. Hopefully this diet will help brain function. I'd rather have crappy food, than have my body fall apart and hurt. Good luck to everyone, I hope you all feel better soon.

I guess if it's not working for you, you should stop taking it (under close medical supervision), but several of the reviewers admit it helps them, then talk about the withdrawl symptoms..  Not real sure why you stop taking a drug that works for you?  Depression is not like an infection -- you aren't ""cured"" by taking a few doses.  If you had high blood pressure, you wouldn't stop taking blood pressure medicine just because it came down while you were on it, would you?  
I have been on this for years and it works for me. I would be a basket case without it.  I was fat to start with, so I guess I didn't notice if I gained weight after I started it. I just know I am a much better person inside my head with it than without it. "

I'm 24 now and slowly came off the drug through a compound formula (literally all the way down to 2.5mg). The drug is extremely hard to come off of - very, very bad withdrawl symptoms.

I won't say I can't cry but it is a rare occurance... as opposed to being something I would have found myself doing often, and with little reason. I am much happier and less ""unreasonable"" now that I am taking Effexor regularly. I am 60 years old and now only use 37.5m daily. Going without the medication is still not an option for me.

The first first time I tried to stop I could not get out of bed. I was feeling so ill I had to call in sick at work. I spent two days like this. I went back to see him and explained what happened and was told that after a couple days I would be fine. Wrong!! I kept taking the tablets because I could not handle feeling so sick. Even after all this still I was not told that I needed to come off them slowly . When I went back to see him, he was away so I had to see another Dr who gave me a lower dose and explained that I needed to take the lower dose for a while before I could come off them completely. I did this for 2 months and then decided that it was time to stop. Had enough. If I had known what was to come I would have never ,ever listened to my doctor and trusted him. It has been over two months now and I'm still having withdrawal symptoms. The nausea, light headed, heart racing,finding it difficult to concentrate, lack of libido, sudden feelings of sadness or anger, sweating even when it's cold, nightmares, just to name a few.

I did not feel it was doing any good whatsoever so when  finished with the Tamoxifen, I asked my doctor to switch me back to the other meds. Even with tapering off, smaller doses etc etc, the side effects and WITHDRAWAL symtoms are beyond belief.  What is in this stuff that makes it so addicting? I still am having the horrible withdrawal symptoms and it's been over a month of cutting down.  NO ONE should ever have to go through withdrawal like this ... if it had been an illegal drug then I could justify it, but a drug that is supposed to help depression - ridiculous.  In my opinion this drug should be taken off the market immediately.

You can do a long taper of weeks, months and in some cases years and you will still have horrible side effects.  A year on, and after having to go on another antidepressant because the side effects of withdrawal were so horrible, I am still not feeling right and one of the worst side effects is memory loss.  Do no take this drug.  The Glaxo Smith Kline July 2012 billion dollar settlement is the tip of the iceberg.  That settlement had to do with prescribing for teenagers and off-label uses (lies) - just wait, there will be more if people on the inside continue to whistle-blow.  Meanwhile, there is nothing to help those whose lives have been ruined by this crap. It is as difficult to get off of as heroin but I am not so sure it isn't worse.  No one really knows how or why it ""works"" - but it works by somehow deadening your feelings. You don't give a damn about anything.  If you ever want to go off of it, plan on tapering and then going crazy anway. "

Weight gain and lack of sex drive seems to be the side effects of all of these SSRI's. It has helped a lot with my major depression. The past 6 months or so, it feel like it has stopped working. Maybe I have been on it too long. I do, however, wonder how any other SSRI will work better since they all basically work the same way. I'll check with my GP and possibly try something else. OR maybe wean myself off of it, which is something that I have been debating fot several years. Time will tell.

I was on prozac for 10 years and did not seem to be working anymore. My doctor put me on 75mg per day and it has been a life changer. I feel somewhat normal again. I dont walk around with my head in the clouds but I am not in a bad mood all the time anymore either. I have had a loss of apetite but that is the only side effect so far.

I feel that I am stuck on this medication!!  I have gone from 112.5 mg to 75 mg I've added Prozac to it now.  I feel great, however I feel like a prisoner at the same time!

Though I was concerned that I didn't need a medication for depression, I trusted my doctor.  My hot flashes were not as frequent or as intense, but I was still getting them.  Plus the other side affects including weight gain, insomnia, lack of sex drive.  After 2 years I decided I would rather have the hot flashes then the side effects, if a medication is not working for what it was prescribed for, why take it?  My mother and grandmother had hot flashes and they managed to survive without any drugs.  I agree with all the posts about going off of the drug, it has been a hellish journey, and I have done under DRs supervision.  First reduced from 75MG to 37.5, then taking every other day, now I have been off for 2 weeks.  Still experiencing dizziness, brain fog, insomnia, but I am going to hang in there as I know eventually I will comletely detox from this drug.  Please do your homework before you start taking this medication.  I have a family  member taking it for depression/anxiety and it works amazing for her, but I would really think about it before using it for hot flashes only.

The other reviews about drug withdrawl are correct:  one cannot just stop, there must be a stepdown period. Times were awful when I allowed myself to run out of the drug, or there was an insurance problem with my reorder.  One or two pharmacists, sympathetic to my plight of being out of the drug and knowing the withdrawl effects, have given me enough meds for a day or two until I could get insurance paperwork straightened out.  Also, according to clinical trial and recommended usage guidelines, this drug is not normally used to treat ADD, so I've had problems getting insurance companies to cover the dosage I use for the purpose for which I use it.  I tried many drugs before settling for this, none were as effective.  The cost is down now that there is a generic formula.

It has been wonderful for me. I was having panic attacks and chest pain that I thought was a heart attack. I was yelling constantly at my children and would have fits of crying. Both my parents suffered from anxiety.  I went on this and a rescue medication. After 3 months I was able to get off the rescue med and continue on this.  I have not had any more panic attacks, or chest pain. I am more patient with my children and my husband loves that I dont get upset at little things like I used to. I am more mellow. The only down side was that it made me sleepy. That diminished after about 3 months.  I keep my pills in a pill strip so that I remember to take on every day. When I forget it gives me horrid headaches.  I know there is a generic now, but I am sticking with the name brand. If you go to the effexor website you can get a card which gives you up to 75.00 off your copay. My insurance charges me over 85.00 a month now because there is a generic, but with the copay card I pay just 10.00 a month.  I was in a horrible place before this medicaion and I dont want to go back there. I hope it continues to work for me.

It took over 24 hours before I felt normal again. I should have called 911, but thought that I had vomited all of it out and that I would feel better soon. Wrong! Very scary time.

502$Condition: Depression$5/24/2012 12:43:19 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  (Patient) $2$1$4$I was prescribed Effexor xr by me PCP. I had some improvement but it didn't seem to change much of my symptoms. I finally got in to see a Psychiatrist and he changed my medication, adjusting to lower the Effexor and increasing the new medication. The first reduction from 225mg down to 150mg caused me horrible mental distress and many other problems. The worst was extreme rage which I had to be prescribed another medication for it because I could not control my anger and could not tolerate any kind of emotions I had. Until my Psychiatrist talked to me and I understood it was the medication, I knew I was in for a hard time. It's been 3 months backing off and I'm just now at 75mg this week and have another 6 weeks to go before I can try staying off the Effexor. I think this medication can be helpful for a lot of permanent problems, but I think it's a catch all pill the PCPs prescribe because it's supposed to cover so many problems. I would recommend going to a Psychiatrist to be diagnosed and get on the proper medication the first time. I'll never let a regular doctor diagnose my mental state again. I could have easily not continued my life because I couldn't handle the withdrawals until the Psych DR. put me on the medication to keep the rage under control. Most people I talk to that have taken this medicine have gotten off it because the unbearable problems it causes.

My whole family is gone.You have to trust me when I tell you that I have tasted hell. I was wound thighter than a mid-western tornado.I then went to my doctor who is a personal friend,internal medicine/infectious deisease,one of the smartest docs in Ca.He did not hesitate to put me on Effexor and I did not even question him. I`m real again.It has been extreamly beneficial for puting me back into society. Effexor: TRazadon for sleep,meditation,yoga,swimming,biking,workouts,ex ersize is crucial.Quit sitting around the house feeling sorry for yourself,this is just a componding scenerio,life is to short for that.Yes,its hard and I sympathize, beleive me, but its still a gift.Embrace the trails,they will make you stonger.Then suck it up and go have some fun.
   Yes there are side effects. Hard to empty my bladder. No problem with erections,ever, but hard to ejaculate sometimes. A little loss of intrest in sex,it just takes someone to get me fired up about it. MY EARS are ringing! Anybody else? I have had some many MRIs in a short period of time that I thought perhaps that might be part of the ear problem.My doctors says the only way to know is to go off of effexor, but there is no way I am ready.On a final note. After reading all the Horror stories about effexor withdrawal, I asked my doc, (who has weined me off of oxicontin,percocet,zanax,alcohol)and asked him about the withdrawal, and he said "" DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 37.5 Mil out of your perscription in a two week period if not longer and then another 37.5 for two more weeks and so on. I am here to tell you all that is a SLOW process or your going to be hating freaking life if you try and go cold turkey on any med., not to mention you could have a seizure!Ahh, excuse me, but what part of talking to your doctor first before stopping this drug don`t you guys understand>?

it helps with the depression, sure, but it stuffs around with the function of your brain - the most complex organism in the known universe - with drugs that have only been around since what, the 70's?  
I have been on and off effexor since 2004 and it has made what would have been simply a 'rough patch' (which is just part of life) drag on until this day and still dragging because now i am addicted.  It has messed up my perception of what is 'normal' for me.  It has made me sedate and subdued and satisfied with not achieving really anything much since then because i have been sort of 'comfortably numb'.  It has stopped me from resolving the original cause of my problems by putting a blanket over them so it's all still there, you just can't feel it until you stop taking the damn stuff.  It has made my personality so flat and dull that i might aswell be depressed. 

IT HAS MADE MY EYES BLURRY AND MY DICK NOT WORK.  

Sure, it helped the depression, but so would lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and drinking, exercising, healthy diet, nutrient supplements and some good councelling.  But i was young, and the doctor's said that i was sick, and you just assume that they know what they're talking about. WELL DON'T!!! Read up on it yourself first!!!  Look into alternatives like relaxation techniques, healthy eating, exercise, see a naturopath, meditate, quit smoking and drinking if you do, make some positive changes in your life, find a good psychologist to talk to, THESE THINGS ARE A LAST RESORT IF-ALL-ELSE-FAILS OPTION!!!  So many GP's and psychiatrists will listen to your symptoms and just start dolling out the drugs! Anti-depressants and benzodiazapines and anti-psychotics are only needed in cases of serious mental illness. Im not mentally ill but i ended up hospitalized when i tried to come off too quickly!

Except when my idiot psychiatrist ""forgot"" to call in my March script and I was forced to stop taking my meds COLD TURKEY one day. I have suffered the withdrawal off of such a powerful medication and have been continuing to withdraw as of this writing.

I have Dystonia Episodes even if Im a few hours late taking this drug. I also had a Gran Mal Seizure when I missed a dose. I am so afraid off getting off this medicine.

534$Condition: Depression$3/4/2012 10:59:30 AM$Reviewer: JJPet, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$This was the 5th drug I have tried in the SSRI/SNRI class. When I tried Effexor, I had finally decided to consult with a psych. I had a similar reaction to all of these drugs, but my one time 18 mg. dose of Effexor was the worst; my body got the warm, tingly sensation, loss of coordination, hard to concentrate, hard to swallow, extreme head ache, body shakes, vomiting, no sleep for 2 days. I only took it one day, and three days later, my head is still pounding. Where as my internist had suggested that I stick with these symptoms for a week in hope they would get better, my psych wanted me to stop and head to the ER right away. Come to find out, not all people can matabolise the SSRI/SNRI drugs. I suggest listen to your body, and if the side effects do not feel right, please consult with psych before continuing to experiment with these drugs.

Then tried lexapro, continued to gain 20 more lbs, eventually stopped working for me.  Effexor XR is much better, but don't try to go off suddenly.  Miserable side effects.  No weight gain on this which is a plus.  Have taken off weight gained on other antidepressants.  In winter go up to 150 mg due to lack of sunlight in northeast.  Pharmacist substituted the generic form and I didn't notice.  Awful.  After 3 days, was an emotional basketcase, crying, sensitive, not sleeping.  Overall has helped me cope with anxiety, stabalized moods and restored my cheerful personality, easier to cope with insanely intense professional job, graduate school and family ... full plate.  Works for me. Hope it helps you.

Pfizer had been providing it to me thru ""connection to care"" assistance program. For that I am greatful! BUT, I tried to re-apply and with NO warning was told via phone that they no longer have Effexor on the program. I have had to stop with only one week of weaning off and have never been so sick. My doctor is very unhappy with Pfizer! It is DANGEROUS to stop without weaning off SLOWLY!!! I was given no heads-up at all that I would'nt be getting a refill. This is not how you treat people, nausea, diarhea, headache, dizzy like the world is swimming, aches all over my body and what feels like ""brain-snaps"" for lack of a better term. I've been living on soda crackers for a week now. I am truely grateful for the pills i was given, but I believe it to be EXTREMELY WRONG not to offer at least a weaning off process with the last supply. They (Pfizer) should be ashamed of putting countless destitute people in harms way after getting them completely dependant on their product. I will never use a Pfizer product again!

While I agree with everyone about the missed dose side-effects (MAN those brain ""zaps"" and vertigo SUCK!), This combo literally saved my relationship. I noted that others experienced sexual side-effects, but I have been fortunate enough to avoid them.  I also agree with the patients here that say that if you take Effexor, make sure you're in it for the ""long haul."" I am, and it has been well worth it as I feel stable again. My advice (at the risk of sounding like a commercial): make sure you consult with your doctor before starting and do NOT try to come off of this Cold Turkey!"

I'm able to focus and think through my reactions to daily events in a way I never could before. HOWEVER, if I'm without my dosage for more than 1 day, I have a terrible reaction: intensely disturbing dreams and ""brain flashes"" like electricity going through my head...AWFUL FEELING!  Even the use of non-XR version doesn't help. I feel like I will never be able to be off this medication. But it's been so helpful in my daily life, not sure I want to discontinue. Very grateful for the generic version."

Took care of my anxiety & hormonal mood swings 100% but helped me feel normal, as myself. Major complaint was lowered sex drive & insomnia; kept me up all night...never slept. Had to discontinue after learning of pregnancy...horrible side effects that lasted 3 weeks: electric shocks orginating from brain to core of body, dizzyness, and mood swings out of control.  Only antidepressant that worked for my hormones however. My mom and sister did well on this too, may have a genetic component.

Hot flashes and night sweats were severe.  Anyone who complains about 'weaning off' should have read about the drug before taking it.  My dr. told me right up front that if I wanted to discontinue useage, I had to be prescribed something else for about 2-3 weeks.  If you're using the internet to read these postings, you should be using it to read about the side-effects of stopping usage suddenly.  Yes, they're severe and horrible.  Missing a pill is not pleasant.  But this is all part of the deal.  I can't take HRT due to cancer history in my family, and this drug has the fewest side effects of anything I researched.  Do your homework, folks, and don't take anything you don't understand fully.  I would (and do!) recommend Effexor as a solution for lots of the miseries of 'change of life'.

I am on a very high dose = 225 MG per day (3 pills), and have been for about 5 years, however I will say my life feels incredibly normal.  I experience hardly any anxiety, nervousness, or mood swings whatsoever.  I can remain calm, cool and collected.  The ONLY downside of this drug, is forget trying to stop taking, or weaning off.  If I miss my dose by even an hour, the withdrawal symptoms are horrid.  I feel electric shocks throughout my body, I feel tired, weak and extremely irritable.  That said, if you stay on a rigid schedule of taking the exact time every day, you will feel blissful.   I have no intentions of discontinuing this drug, and my doctor has decided long term use is not harmful.  Overall this drug has been lifechanging and I am forever thankful for it.  I feel like ME again.

This has been the only one that works fast and I have no side effects (75 mg). The plus side is that I also don't eat as much. I would start forgetting to take it and just take myself off. I had tried the 150mg and it did cause nausea for 1 week. I think it was too strong for my body. The 75mg I could not even tell I took anything other than I would not have the attacks and I felt more like myself.

It has been three weeks of weaning this drug out of my system but I don't see any light at the end of this tunnel. Everyday I feel worse than the day before...and I wonder if these effects are permanent. I would tell others never to go on Effexor unless they commit to lifetime use never trying to come off of it.

I like the change in my mood but continue to need Xanax for anxiety before sleep. My only complaint about Effexor (both versions) is that they will make me quite drowsy and nauseated for about 6-8 hours after ingestion.  I have learned to take them in the late afternoon or at dinner, then I can sleep or drowse through the evening, feel nauseated in the comfort of my own home and will continue with this regimen when I find a new job and go back to work.  It definitely has made me feel brighter and less depressed than Prozac. Prozac and Abilify worked equally well, but the cost of Abilify was just too high for me to continue. So I am happy with this combination.

The first 2 weeks were pretty bad. Loss of sex drive, couldn't sleep more than 2 hours a night and felt like I was on speed. After 2 weeks it seemed to be working to treat my depression without side affects. Looking back, I think this drug contributed to me having to file bankruptsy. While on this drug I was reckless with money. I spent money like it grew on trees, maxed out the credit cards and didn't have a care in the world about any consequences of my actions. I had short term memory loss and could never pay attention for more than a few minutes.

When I got severely depressed I thought that no drug could help me with a terrible quality of life from 24/7 migraines that not only gave me constant pain, but prevented me from doing much of anything for the 2 and half years before.  Also having had a major stroke I was suffering from other disabilities.  A certain percentage of those suffering from chronic pain do commit suicide.  The doctor had me increase the dose and get counseling.  I never got the counseling, but 4 weeks later the depression went away--and still with the same horrible life.  Although I believe that the higher dose did help with some of my migraine pain.

I have now gone off of it and switched to Pristiq because of the lack of any sex drive.  We'll see if it improves.  

I have suffered from depression for many years and am committed to taking anti-depressants for the rest of my life, so the fear of getting off of it is not a concern.  I did in fact discontinue the Effexor while first switching to Savella which caused extreme nausea and never got it up to proper dose--now to the Pristiq.  If you taper off Effexor gradually, you can get off of it, unless you need it and then the depression will return. I had that experience as well years ago.

I had no other side effects other than the lack of sex drive--a big one."

It worked wonders!!  I was on 75 mg. for years with no issues.  My insurance company then felt that need to substitute the brand name with generic (which I did not catch, so I could not figure out what was wrong with me), and I crashed-BIG TIME.  The generic is in no way like the brand name.  It took me a good 3 months to get back to where I was.  I have since increased to 150 mg. after the loss of my father, and slipping back a bit.  I did notice that if I fluctuate the times of taking it, even by a couple of hours, I will have a difficult time with anxiety/sweats.  Has anyone else ever experienced that?  When I called the doctor they automatically wanted to increase the dosage, but I am hesitant to do so because I am fearful that everytime I increase it gets me closer to being at the max I can take, and I don't want to ever get to a point where I can't take this med.  I am extremely med sensitive, and to find something that works for me is a godsend.  I know that the withdrawal is awful, but quite honestly, I never plan to stop taking this.

I haven't gained weight and have lost/been able to maintain my weight unlike what I was on previously. My headaches haven't increased. I'm in my mid-60's and doing fine on the drug. After reading all the horror stories that people have posted, I have to wonder why they kept upping the drug if it wasn't working for them. There are so many types of drugs for depression, you should work with your doctor to find the one that's right for you. If your current doctor doesn't help or they're just fishing for different drugs and not monitoring you, CHANGE DOCTOR'S.

Six months into it and I went back down to the lowest dose and six months later I stopped taking it.

This drug has been the worst thing that's happened to me. I've been on it for approximately 5-6 years at 300mg daily. When starting, no problems at all. After the effective period (which has been so long ago, i dont even remember when it stopped working) ended and i became so uncontrollably sick from the withdraws I started reading on here about what i was going thru. I was amazed how many people were reporting the EXACT same things i was going through, but more so the fact that my dr told me NOTHING about any of it! Since then I have literally been too afraid to try to stop again because of the withdraws. This drug is so highly addictive it is unreal. Until the last month, I've taken the medication with no benefits with the sole reason being the fear of withdraw symptoms. The last month, however, My depression has escalated and feel that I can no longer fear the withdraw and still be this miserable. I have a new prescription (cylexa I believe) and will be starting in the next day or so.

Kind of like just sweeping everything under the rug - I'm okay with that; I guess I'm happy just avoiding the problem.

I first came on WebMD and read all of the amazing reviews of how people love this product. I suffer from panic attacks, usually brought on my situations or events. I didn't have general anxiety and a Xanax was usually how I would treat an attack.  But since my attacks were becoming slightly frequent the doctor prescribed me Effexor XR 75mg.  I took my first pill after breakfast and within 2 hours I started too feel like a zombie. I also started to exhibit signs of an anxiety attack (sweaty palms, hot/cold, nausea)But I was able to press on, went into day two, same thing, trouble sleeping, overall miserable. So I started reading online, most people were starting off at 37.5mg. not 75mg. so on the 3rd day I put a call into the doctor to find out what he thought, because obviously something wasn't right with this prescription.  Within 2 hrs of being awake I felt a panic attack starting, so I took .5mg of Xanax hoping that would calm me down.  Unfortunately the panic attack was full blown, and was one of the worst attacks I have had in over 10 years.  I was on the verge of calling 911 to help get me sedated but luckily I had family who helped sedate me and get me to sleep.  Today is the 2nd day without this medication, and again I woke up with the same general anxiety and uneasy feeling I had yesterday. All in all, this medication is not for everyone. The side effects are very real, and very strong. I was brought up around anxiety in my family and am very knowledge on what triggers my attacks and how to handle them accordingly.  What I am experiencing because of this Effexor XR is not horrible and beyond anything I have dealt with before.  I strongly suggest that you use this with caution and I hope that if you read this and it helps you I have done my job. This is my first review on here and I just felt the need to share how horrible my experience was with this medication. I would not ever take this again.

I was on Zoloft for 3 months and started having panic attacks and anxiety all the time so the venlafaxine has been a godsend.  I have gained 10+lbs even while exercising and watching my food.  I have noticed when I miss a dose I get a very bad headache, dizziness and nausea.  No sex drive.  I did not realize that stopping the drug would be so terrible as described in the other comments.  If it is anything like missing a dose I know it will be bad.  For now it has helped me and until I read about withdraw symptoms I would have said this stuff was great.

It hasn't really helped much with my anxiety though.

My dosage was 300 mg per day. The reason I am commenting is I have been tapering off of the med and want to forwarn anyone to not do it without a dr. The withdrawals are bad, please do it slowly. I have had all kinds of withdrawals that have been very scary and still are having them. Please for your own good, do not do this on your own. This is one medication I will never go on again, or one like it. Please be careful with your decisions and your health, thank you!

It helped with my depression for several years, but being on this drug long term caused a multitude of physical problems. In addition to confusion, sexual dysfunction, constipation, constant gas, ringing in my ears, and memory problems, in the last year I have developed severe stomach problems, weird and frightening dreams, twitching of my legs, arms and hands. I weaned myself off this drug for 2 weeks, then went cold turkey 3 weeks ago when I realized my stomach problems were improving since I stopped taking Effexor.  Right now I fight unexpected feelings of irritablility on and off all day, sadness, and frustration, but I can eat anything I want, no more heartburn or indigestion.  My sex life is back, and I have more energy. I am trying to be aware of my moods and if I feel that I need medication again, it will not be Effexor.

I had/have panic disorder and thought I was going to lose my mind to uncontrollable fear (fight or flight feelings)..it cam so suddenly and prevented me from eating, sleeping, drinking, etc. My doctor put me on this and it may have saved my sanity. I got a grip. I didn't intend to stay on it because if you miss a dose you start to feel VERY strange...I did not like that...but when taken properly it was a savior, and it's the only drug I have ever said that about. I didn't feel worse, or more depressive, I just felt better and clamer. I did go off of it because I want to be as medication-free as possible. But it did help me get control over my panic/anxiety...coming off the medicine slowly was still rough. I had my fiance on the phone almost all night at the worst of the withdrawl. But everything was OK. At least I know I can come back to this medicine if my panic ever gets to that point again.

I think i've read enough.  I have been on Effexor XR for 6 days now.  I am eager to have this drug take effect.  I am currently on Paxil 60mg.  I started feeling the drug in my body within a couple hours; neither positive benefits or negative one yet except I had a hard time falling asleep last night. I'm taking 75mg once per day at bed time.  Paxil took 4 weeks to really benefit me.  Dont stress out about whether it will work or not; just go on about your business letting the days pass and sooner than later you will make a decision on what to do.  Paxil has been a life changer for me.  I never knew so many others had this excruciating condition.  I don't plan on ever getting off these meds; they work so well.  I need to take it, no big deal.

658$Condition: Depression$7/24/2011 10:09:18 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I know that a lot of people say they have had problems coming off this medication but that is not always the case.  If you carefully follow your doctor's instructions there are a number of things you can do to make the transition quite manageable (including decreasing the dose very slowly and adding a drug like Prozac).  Never stop taking Effexor without your doctor's instructions but don't be frightened away from a medication that may help your life feel worth living again.  I have been taking 300mg/day Effexor for over a year now and it is the very best thing that has helped me manage my depression.  I have always followed my Doctor's instructions and have not had any problems with the medication.  I do have to be very careful not to miss a dose though or I experience a lot of dizziness and anxiety.  I have been treated for severe depressive disorder for about 6 years and have taken a number of different different medications as part of my treatment (including Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Lamictal).  I was only getting minimal benefit from depression medications when my PCP was prescribing them but since I started seeing a psychiatrist and she put me on Effexor I have been managing so so so much better (even when my Mom died of cancer last year).  I highly recommend getting a psychiatrist and talking with them about all the pros and cons if you are considering taking Effexor.

I feel that it was poor choice for me as my depression has historically had significant anxiety component with inability to be still, severe insomnia (partially work hours related, partially just me) When I started Effexor, I almost immediately started losing ability to pay attention to what I was doing, seeing, hearing etc.  Huge memory gaps still exist although I stopped taking it about a month ago.  Plain SSRIs used to work, and I have restarted Sertraline which I'd taken successfully before.  I was so unaware of the effect, I didn't even know I should be calling psychiatrist or PCP.  After about a year, it got so bad, I couldn't perform my work and have been underemployed, then finally unemployed.  Will the lost memory come back? (new ones are f0roming quite well now

I quit taking meds for about a year, but depression returned. Began taking Effexor; first at lowest dose, gradually raising to 150. Yes, there are some side effects; trouble sleeping (I take it in the morning now), some weight gain (not all due to the drug I'm sure), and if I forget to take a dose, I feel dizzy (Use a weekly pill box and keep some in your purse or at work just in case). I can live with those relatively minor side effects. I can't live with the constant darkness and occasional suicidal thoughts I had before. I've been taking this medication for years, recently with the addition of Wellbutrin. I will continue taking this medication as long as I need to. If, for some reason, I needed to quit taking it I'd work with my doctor to gradually lower the daily dose ... not just skip doses or quit taking them.

Since then I have been taking Gabapentin 600mg 3 x a day, Skelaxin 800mg 3 x a day as well as Dermerol 50mg at least 3 x a day, but usually 5 to 6 times a day  There was some relief but not much and was unable to sleep on my left side at all due to the severe pain in my hip and leg.  Added Elavil 75mg to help with sleeping which did help however the side effect of an increased desire for sweets eventually became too much to deal with.  As I was eating one thing, I was thinking about what to have next.  With my height at 4' 10'' my weight ballooned up to 140 lbs I was very uncomfortable, so I stopped taking it.  My pain was to the point I could barely function and I became severely depressed, fatigued and my pain was off the charts, at least as far as I was concerned.  After researching Cymbalta and Effexor I talked with my doctor and decided to give the Effexor xr 75mg a try.  I have been on it for 3 months now and I am very pleased with the results.  My depression has all but abated, I have my ""bad"" days one or two days a week mainly fatigue but not as bad as it was.  But more importantly is my PAIN IS SO MUCH BETTER!  I am hoping to get off of the Gabapentin and Skelaxin as well as weaning off of the Demerol.  I'm finding that I don't need it as much as before.  As long as it continues to work for me I have no issue with staying on it.  I do have some side effects, I always have a slight headache but I can deal with it, if it gets too bad then I take some Ibuprofen.  The most annoying side effect is the sweating, I live in the Desert Southwest where the temps often run 110 degrees in the summer months.  I'd rather sweat than be in pain.  The insomnia was the worst, however I've found that if I take in the morning that seems to work for me. "

How long do the effects last?  Am I destined to stay on this drug for the rest of my life?

I guess I'm very lucky that something finally worked.  But, on the minus side, withdrawal is a BITCH!  If I miss one dose, I get a persistant headache and my thinking becomes cloudy.  Last year, I was in the hospital for my depression and the first day there, they did not give me any meds until late in the day.  By that time, I was already feeling really crappy.  The nurse insisted that what I was feeling was not withdrawal.  I knew better, of course.  Anyway, you really have to weigh the pros and cons before you take something as powerful as what we're prescribed.

I've been on it aprox 6 yrs. Now coming off of it. I felt for the last several yrs I was living in a fog, just realized the last yr it was the effexor xr. I couldn't concentrate, some days couldn't get the words out I wanted to say and tired most of the time. Best way to describe it would be living in a numb state...not depressed, but not anything, just living live a zombie.  I've been reducing dosage for the last two mths. Usually very, very passive, but first day on reduced (from 75 to 37) I was so angry I thru a bottle and put a hole in the wall. My 2nd day off it completly(today) is a nightmare! Now very ANGRY & Mean! Yelled at my elderly mom yesterday and mad at everything. Today, I'm mad one second,crying the next. Minor brain zaps,minor because I withdrew slowly, was down to aprox 15 mg when I stopped completly. For anyone contemplating taking this, PLEASE research it in detail. If you do an internet search you will see that I am one of many going thru the hell of withdrawals on this awful medicine. Dr's DO NOT tell you what this is like. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone...well maybe the CEO of the drug company that makes this horrible stuff!

Let me begin by saying that I am not a typical case. Six years ago at the young age of 28, I become post-menopausal do to surgically removing ovarian tumors. Because of this, I do not have hot flashes. My symptoms are extremely slow metabalism and low libido. So my doctor gave me Effexor in the smallest dose to hopefully combat these symptoms. Although I read all of the reviews here before taking it, everyone reacts differently so I decided to try it. I took 1 pill Sunday night. Within an hour my heart began to race. I did not sleep all night, and went to work the next day. My eyes were bugged out and I was wired, I could have ran a marathon! By 2:00pm I started to come down, my heart stopped racing but I was still wired. I did not take another dose Mon. evening, and I slept well. However, I woke up Tues. with a horrible headache. Within 15 minutes the diarehea started and then immediately the vomitting. I couldn't even keep down water. After vomitting 15 times, I had to call off work and was able to go back to sleep. I slept over 14 hours that day and finally kept down soup at 4:00pm. Another full night of sleep, Wed. I was a little groggy and Thurs. I felt like myself. All of this was only with ONE DOSE and the minimum dosage at that! Although everyone reacts differently, please research this well and have someone available who can monitor you and help you if you need it. This is very potent stuff. Good Luck.

Expensive as anything and the only way I could afford it was to go through the Wyeth patient assistance program.  Now I'm in Portugal to help elderly relatives and can't get access, so I'm trying to wean off it.  IT SUCKS!  Withdrawal is hell!  If you can avoid starting it, all the better, believe me!  Best advice for weaning off it is to avoid anyone you care about so you don't tear their heads off and walk as much as possible.  That's my best strategy anyway.  I'd surely like to be asleep right now but that's not happening thanks to these lovely withdrawal symptoms. ARRRRRGGGGG!

I actually thought I was having a nervous breakdown! The constant crying I could handle but when the dizziness and the brain zaps started it really scared me. I went to a doctor who told me that I should have been weaned off of that one and it will take 2 to 3 weeks for the withdrawal symptoms to ease. Now I have to take Klonopine for a few weeks to help with the symptoms but I will have to be weaned off of that also!!!

It has caused a few strange things-sweating is more prominent as are the vivid dreams.  Increased blood pressure/heart rate.  If you miss a dose, you can definitely feel it within a couple hours of normal taking time.  I got pregnant a few years back and they stopped me cold turkey-DO NOT DO THIS!!!  The side effects are WORSE than taking the drug.  They finally realized this and put me back on it.  It has truly helped me, despite the negative parts-its been a life saver for me.

I take 150mg/day. Is pretty effective although some days I feel like a need a larger dose. I don't really notice any side effects when I take it correctly but like other writers have mentioned DO NOT miss a dose or withdrawl kicks in immediately. I ran out once and missed 2 days and thought I had the flu or mono for a week. I can always tell immediatly if I've forgotten to take my medicine within a about 4 hours.
Remember not every medication works for every person. Also when 37.5mg may be effective for one person another may need 150mg to be effective. Do not just assume because the doctor started you out on one dose that this will work for you. Keep in close contact with your doctor so that adjustments can be made if one dose isn't working for you. I do agree though that family doctors and internists should not be allowed to prescribe psychiatric medications without scheduling psychiatrist followup with their patients first. I know my doctor wrote me the rx when I asked and then just keeps renewing it. Not a good idea. "

Chocolate is sending me into mania.  I haven't had caffeine for years but starting having some for migraines.  I believe since I have been taking what I think is generic everything has changed.

I was originally prescribed Celexa, Lexapro (which I hated, although I know many others who swear by it), and EffexorXR with Effexor being simultaneously the most effective yet most difficult to adjust to.  Withdraw was annoying but not unbearable.  I found the worse symptoms occur from not being properly titrated.  My doctor started me on 150mg after being off of the drug for 2 years.  I'm now one week into the treatment and have severe diarrhea, no appetite at all, and have hardly slept a good nights sleep in a week.  Please don't be discouraged by this drug by my review, it certainly improved my quality of life when prescribed properly. However Effexor when not properly prescribed can make a patient non-compliant and unwilling to seek much needed treatment due to these uncomfortable side effects.  To all suffering from depression and anxiety out there, I wish you all the best and i hope my review was helpful.

Plus, will it begin to taper off the flat mood & help me be stable again. My anxiety & blood pressure have been affected the most."

I'm currently taking the drug and have been for around 2 years now. The FDA recently approved of a generic, which is fantastic because even with the best insurance my medication costs were through the roof. *HOWEVER* - Ween yourself ONTO, and OFF of the drug. DO. NOT. MISS. A. DOSE. Anything more than 24 hours off the drug and it feels like you're dying. Headache, dizziness, double-vision, nausea, muscle pain, crying fits - you name it. If you are thinking about coming off the drug, start off slow. It's something you need to talk to your doctor about. When taken properly, just like any other drug, it works wonders.

I'll tell you what I am doing that seems to lessen the withdrawal effect. First get a notepad because you are going to want to write everything down because you will be decreasing your dosages. Your effexor XR capsule will have little white beads inside of it. Depending on your dosage, that is how many beads are in it. My dose is 75 mg, so I have 75 little white beads in it. Step 2 is to get a small dark colored bowl and a pencil. Next wiggle ""cap"" off the capsule. This is the shorter end of the capsule. Once you have it off then set it to the side. Now you will see that there are the tiny little white beads inside. Do not dump the entire content of beads into the dark colored bowl! (I use the dark colored bowl since it's easier to spot and count the beads). Now while holding the capsule, tip it slightly to loosen the beads up and grab your pencil. With the pencil tip, easily scrape the beads out one at a time if you can. Always check your bowl and COUNT the white beads because you need to be exact. EVERY DAY YOU WILL REDUCE YOUR DOSAGE BY 5 WHITE BEADS! DON'T REDUCE BY ANYMORE THAN THAT OR YOU WILL DEFINITELY EXPERIENCE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS! Once you remove 5 beads from the capsule, screw the top ""cap"" on snug. You will have to wiggle it back on. Discard the beads preferably in an old medicine bottle with a child-proof cap. Take the capsule with at least a bottle of water to wash down and WITH food. Do not take with juice because I heard it can increase the effects of medications. So far I have reduced by Effexor dosage from 75 mg to 40mg with no side effects. I am really starting to feel like I am getting my personality back! Plus I have dropped a few pounds since my body is feeling alive again. I recommend this method to anyone wanting to get off this Effexor nightmare. Do not stop cold turkey or you'll be like a person experiencing a heroin withdrawal and that's not a pretty sight!"

Do not stop taking Effexor without sloooowly reducing your beads! Otherwise you'll be like someone going through a heroin withdrawal and that's not a pretty sight! It might seem like it will take forever but you will get off this beast! 
861$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/25/2010 9:19:05 PM$Reviewer: Jojo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$3$5$"I've been skeptical for last 2 yrs on taking any anti-anxiety medication, but finally due to the worsening of my physical symptoms (panic attacks and shortness of breath in middle of the night, insomnia, high blood pressure), my doctor has prescribed what I refer to as the ""happy pill/miracle drug"".  My first experience of taking this drug - within two hours of taking my first dose of 37.5 mg - I had blurred vision, fatigue and a ""fogginess sensation"".  Same night, I had experienced insomnia, extreme night sweats and flue-like symptoms.   Above side effects has since subsided.  It's now been three weeks on same daily dosage, and am now re-experiencing blurred vision again and ringing in my ears.  As for my panic attacks and other symptoms at night, it's gone.  I'm currently on meds for HBP, and is closely monitored.  Pros-""It definitely works - no more anxiety:)  You get a good night rest.  Live a normal life again"".  Cons-""What price do you have to pay?  Does the side effects of this drug really worth  living with?  Are the withdrawal symptoms really worse than what I was going thru b4 this ""wonder drug""?  What are the long-term effects on your liver and other internal organs?  Is it really worth it?  I'm still debating on whether to continue Effexor or not since I have no intention of increasing my current dosage for obvious reasons.  I may go back to herb medicine since I never experienced any side effects as indicated above and no withdrawal symptoms.  
**In conclusion, Efferol does relieve anxiety symptoms, and I have felt the immediate effects within two weeks of taking it. As for continuing on taking it, we'll have to see if there's any other alternate methods-Natual products, healthy diet, meditation and relaxation techniques, acupuncture and exercise... "

It helped a great deal and the benefits of the drug outweighed the negatives. The negatives for me were extreme exhaustion and lack of ability to get up and do social things like I used to. I did continue to force myself to going out with my friends and became used to living with the exhaustion. Tho it was always nagging part of my life. Sleeping 11 hours + a night and still being tired. Not to mention the vivid dreams and drenching night sweats (not just sweat, but clothes are wet and sheets are wet to visible point - like an absorbed puddle almost).

After 5 years I've decided to go off the medication, I feel my life is in a much better place and I'd like to try life drug free. Also, at this time, the negatives were outweighing the positives. 

I've been on a dose of Effexor XR 150 for 5 years. I've been weaning off for a full 5 weeks under the supervision of a psychiatrist that I see once a week. It went well at first but as I'm approaching my 3rd week on a quarter does (37.5) I've become really sick. Terrible headaches every day, vomiting, dizziness, motion sickness...its really debilitating and I'm now out of sick days for work. 

Aside from the actual physical sickness, I'm also having high anxiety and could burst into tears at any point. It could be a great joy or pretty much any emotion/feeling that triggers this. 

I wish I knew what I was getting into. I don't regret my 5 years on the drug and the way it helped me get my life back in order - but I was not prepared for the terrible withdraws from this drug. "

If I had it to do over I would have much rather endured the weeping and heart ache than the tremendous ordeal and physical side effects this has been! I cannot wait till this is entirely out of my body! Please if there is another non addictive drug take that! This is horrible!!! If you have to get up and work your life will be hell untill this has been cleansed entirely from your system. I am not sure how long that process takes but would love to hear a report of someone who made it off and how long it took them to ween from the drug and the side effects leaving.

I have tried several antidepressants for my anxiety disorder and this one seems to work the best for me. When I felt that I didn't need anything anymore the Doctor had me wean off and low and behold the  withdrawal symptoms that you read about for this drug were horrible... for two and 1/2 weeks I was nauseous and dizzy with vertigo symptoms non stop and lost weight. After the withdrawal wore away is when I felt that I needed something yet to help control my anxiety. I am now on the 3rd drug and am almost ready to tell my doctor that I'd rather be back on Effexor XR again. Only one other downfall other than the withdrawal symptoms is it causes low libido. We have to work on that one.

When your body adjusts, then it's like you're not taking anything at all.  However, if you forget a dose, you feel very weak and dizzy.  There are also unpleasant withdrawal (they refer to it as discontinuation effects) symptoms.....you feel absolutey horrible for days on end.  I wish I never took then, and cannot wait until my body adjuss to being off of it.  Be sure that you really want to take it, or that there are NO other options before you do.  If you must take it, ask your MD lots of questions.

Worked for hot flashes and the depression, however, - Life is very stressful weening off of it. The Tinnitus from the drug has become very difficult to cope with. My  Doc is taking me off (weening) effexor to go back on Zoloft. The five day 'no med' period is just awful. The well known brain shivers, headache, depression, zero concentration are debilitating. Will this stop once on the Zoloft - how soon after starting? I had actually thought that maybe I could start life anew with NO meds. Effexor weening is the most difficult medical experience I have ever had. I wouldnt wish it on my anyone.How much time would it take to stop these effects?

I had pretty much tried all the other ones and nothing worked, I couldn't tell I was taking anything and I would just stop taking them abrubtly and nothing happened.  HOWEVER,  when I was prescribed Effexor, after the first few days I started having nightmares, I mean CRAZY nightmares and during the day I felt like I was in a fog.  It was the scariest feeling ever.  So I just stopped taking them. WHEW!! That's when I really thought I was losing my mind.  I called my DR but he never got back with me.  (It was a new DR)  So I got on the internet and read about it and I found all these other horror stories exactly like mine.  And you can NOT just stop taking them so as bad as I hated to I had to start back up and wean myself off them.  I take Klonopin now and it works awesome.  However,  it's not for depression, only anxiety so if you have depression you will need something with it.  I just wanted to tell my experience about Effexor,  I'm glad it helps some people, just be careful and ask a lot of questions to your DR ahead of time!!

I hated life and asked my husband if we could give our child up for adoption.  I knew something was seriously wrong, so I went to the doctor.  They put me on Zoloft, but it didn't work and I didn't have several weeks to wait and see if it would work.  I went back to the doctor, and they put me on Effexor XR.  It started working within a few days and significantly increased the quality of my life.  I could take care of my baby again and began sleeping better and enjoying life again.  The only side effect I noticed was strange dreams, but that was a small price to pay for feeling human again.  I was on it for about a year and decided to wean off it after finding out that I am pregnant again.  I was on a dose of 75mg/day, and it took me about two and a half weeks to wean off Effexor completely.  The only side effect of weaning off was that my head felt ""floaty"" - I joked with my husband that I felt like a bobblehead.  I am starting to feel more anxiety again and may go back on it if it is safe to use during pregnancy.  I know Effexor is not for everyone, but it truly has been a miracle drug for me."

I had to give up my job in L.A. and move to Las Vegas when my husband was transferred in 2000; this was a monumental step for me, causing great headaches and depression. 
Once when I went on a five-day cruise, I forgot to take this medication and experienced withdrawal involving nausea and stomach aches; that reaction frightened me, and I am very cautious now not to forget the appropriate amount of Effexor XR when I travel. I have had absolutely no negative side effects other than the one mentioned above. 
Many unhappy experiences have occurred in my life since 2000, but Effexor XR has helped me considerably, and I wouldn't want to change to another anti-depression medication. In fact, my doctor asked if I wanted to try Pristiq, a newer anti-depression drug; I did experience it for two or three weeks, and it was not a good or effective medication. I was teary and emotionally upset for the duration of the drug use. I returned to Effexor XR and felt completely better and more satisfied immediately.
The only drawback is the expense of Effexor XR; I run out of insurance in June, and it costs me around $400 for a 90-count the rest of the year; however, I have to continue with it because it does the job. "

I'm doing pretty well this week, still have the brain shivers, but they're not as frequent or as severe.  I would recommend reading the experiences of others BEFORE taking Effexor XR.

My doctor increased the dosage to 150 mg. 

This was where all went wrong.

The symptoms of needing an increase in dosage are similar to the symptoms of needing a decrease. I went the wrong way. 

For nearly 2 years I stayed on 150 mg- my attention span barely existed, my short-term memory was terrible, and I felt as if I was constantly in a fog-- much like the original depression. 

In an attempt to rid myself of all medicines, I quite cold turkey for about a week. The same withdrawal symptoms that everyone talks about- the brain ""zaps"", dizziness, headaches, shaking, etc.- consumed me. 

What I did next saved my life in many ways. I went to ANOTHER doctor who put me on 37.5 mg. I began to feel stable for once. I felt as if I was back again; I felt like me. I have been on 37.5 mg now for a while, and all is well. I have no outbursts, no lows, and even no manic states.

I have lived with severe anxiety my whole life. The benefits of this medication in the past 5 weeks are AMAZING! I do have a few concerns, I don't care for the daily left temple headache that comes and goes through out the day; but not stressing about everything all the time makes me happier than I have ever been! The other two side effects I have are that it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy sex or orgasm anymore and some nights I wake (3-5 am) and have HORRIBLE episodes of anxiety to the point of a panic attack much worse than before I started taking the Effexor.  I thought this medication was ""constant"". Is there a ""low time"" with this medication?? No one else has commented on this in any other post so maybe it's just me? I am very worried about increasing or weaning from this medication per all the reviews here but I am SO COMPLETELY HAPPY during the day without all the looping crazy thoughts in the back of my mind that have plagued my life prior to the Effexor XR. Lastly, I also take Adderall for ADD, I am glad I talked to the Pharmacist before starting the Effexor, he told me that I needed to space the two medications a minimum of 2 hours apart every morning or I would not be happy with the side effects."

The tingling in my face and head and hands and then sever panic attack that i can't breath and i know that i am fine but the withdrawls are horrible i don't recommend taking this medication unless nessary because it is very difficult to come off of it.

Right now I am weaning off of it. These withdrawal descriptions are scaring the hell out of me! They are enough to create anxiety themselves!

However, I began feeling more and more aggitated and anxious. Plus, the weight gain and not able to stop it created ""image issues"". I decided to come off the medicine. I spoke to my doctor and began the awful process of weaning off the drug. Once getting from 75mg to 37.5mg was not so bad. But then when I was down to nothing the pain began....the nausea, vomiting, ""brain zaps"", tingling in my arms and legs, and feeling not in control of my emotions became too much to bear. I started lashing out at my husband and one night it got so bad I tried to committ suicide! 
I am in the process of finding other alternatives to control these symptoms...Valerian root and ginger tea have helped me the most!!
I think doctors should warn of the pain and problems this drug has when one is trying to come off of it. "

The sympton that has got me freaked out is the the ""brain zaps"" like explained from the last user. When I move my eyes or move my body a certain way i get those zaps in my head and sometimes it shoots down to my fingertips. I'm gogn to talk with my dr tomorrow.

What ever you do Do not take Effexor without reading the effects you will have when you want to come off it...#1 The effects you will live with when coming off this drug are not worth it....I weaned off the best way possible going from 150mg to 107 to 75 and finally to 37.5 over a couple months and still had to live with the worst side effects / withdraw symptoms you could imagine for months!!  You dont get warnings on this before taking this drug.  Look/google it up and read the horror stories before you decide to take this drug... You will be sooooo sick no matter what when you try to get off this drug.....tons of people can not get off because of how bad the withdrawl is.  You just can not function...You are to ill to move, you get so dizzy you vomit, you get weird brain zapping feelings, you cant concentrate, I was afraid to drive it was so bad and so on... #2 Now being off this drug and the side effects slowing  I feel so alive, motivated, happy,I can finally poop like normal and sex !! Being on Effexor you might as well forget sex... I forgot how fun it was (lol). I had no idea what this drug did to me, looking back just a month later and how I feel now,,,,Was I a walking zombie?...I dont know but Im so happy to be off it....I would not recommend Effexor to anyone!!!

I could not handle that dosage at all, i felt drugged all the time so I weened myself back to 75mg, which took a week to feel ""normal"" again because of the side effects of the withdrawal! Over time, it has stopped working for the depression, but my mood swings are still being stabilized.  If you are getting it prescribed just for depression, don't take it!

988$Condition: Depression$6/5/2010 5:36:35 PM$Reviewer: Ethomas99, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$1$If you're reading reviews because you are considering taking Effexor, PLEASE READ THIS. I hope this medication gets taken off the market. I was put on 37.5 mg in a psychiatric ward while I was suffering extreme depression from drug abuse and psychosis in 2006. It helped a lot. My brain was so imbalanced from my drug use that at the time, I needed medication. However, the initial euphoric reaction I had to it faded, and my quack doctor increased my dosage more and more. By 2008 I was on 300 mg, the maximum dose. I stayed on it, out of fear. Why was I afraid? Because missing a dose even by a matter of hours made me experience severe withdrawal. In the beginning, I dropped 30 pounds in 3 months, but then gained it all back slowly and no matter how healthy I ate or how often I excersised, I couldn't lose weight. My hair also stopped growing. Finally with enough support from family and friends, I tapered down. It's taken almost 2 years to go from 300 to 75 mg. Each time I taper, I have debilitating withdrawal. Nausea, sweating, anxiety, mood swings, body aches, brain zaps (feels like fireworks going off in my head) and extreme trouble organizing thoughts. But my hair grew and I lost weight. My mood became stable and I was generally more upbeat. I stopped getting overly upset at small things and my energy skyrocketed. I have to wonder what must be in this medication that makes withdrawal reduce me to the fetal position, crying in a pool of sweat, and taking less of it makes my hair grow and restores my metabolism. I can't wait to be done with this. It's taken me to hell and back. It traps you into a physical dependency that makes it impossible to skip a dose or stop, because withdrawal is so scary and the half life is so short that if I forget to take it and leave for work in the morning, I have to anticipate getting sick by the afternoon. STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF, IT'S EVIL.

I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 12, I am 26 now, and this is the ONLY drug that has worked for me. I have tried many, many medications and Effexor has had the best results with the least amount of side effects. Granted, the withdrawals are terrible, but if you are responsible and don't run out before you refill, this is not a problem. I have had NO weight gain because of this medication. My opinion is this goes to show you that these types of medications work differently for different people, so don't put too much credence in these reviews.

HOWEVER...
I went to Hawaii on vacation and forgot my meds.  Luckily I was able to get more but it took 4 days.  The first 2 days without Effexor Xr were tollerable.  The last 2 days I was extremely suicidal.  My withdrawal symptoms included extreme suicidal thoughts, awful taste, heebie-jeebies, clothes felt like sandpaper, people touching me freaked me out, socially a mess and horrible nightmares.  The devil was one step behind me...Mind you I was on holiday in Hawaii.  Hours after taking my dose I felt reborn and finally enjoyed the wonderful environment. 
This drug is very powerful. Every debilitating reason I took the drug was hightened 10 fold during withdrawals.  
I don't have the funds to pay for the drug so Wyeth has supported me with free meds through their patient assistance program.

It seemed to work very well.  But I had no idea how hard it would be to stop taking. The cost got way too much.  Tried to stop but withdrawal was horrendous.  Even missing a dose was very bad.  Most Drs do NOT understand how bad  it is to stop.  This drug should come with a warning.  I have read so many people have tried to stop and can't.  PLEASE do NOT tae this medicine.  Find another.  Finally, I went to a psychiatrist to help me wean off.  I have been off effexor for one month now.  She had me take Wellbutrin and celexa.  I will have to wean off celexa but nothing like effexor.  The first 2 weeks after I stopped effexor were bad.  I had flu like symptons, aches, nausea dizziness and those brain shocks.  They have lessened.  I am still dizzy quite a bit but it is manageable. I began wellbutrin and celexa 2 weeks prior to stopping effexor.  I was on 75 mg effexor and stopped cold turkey.  Depression is good and I am so glad to not be a slave to that drug.  I plan to wean off all meds in 2 months and see how it goes.  I am starting to feel myself again.  I didn't think I was that numb on effexor but I was.

But the worse part is trying to stop taking it!  It is the worse symptoms I have ever had from anything.  It has lasted 4 days now and shows no signs of lessening.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!  Check the internet for other stories like mine - they are numerous!  If I had known, I would NEVER have started taking this in the first place.

I had tried Lexapro, Zoloft, and one other drepression med with no luck. I have struggled with depression since about 10 years old and within 3 years of taking Effexor XR in the 75mg dosage, I have been taken off depression meds completely. There are times that I feel I need it and I am comforted to know that if I do get a reoccurance of depression that I have something that I know works.

I was not advised of the horrific withdrawal symptoms. My GP prescribed me this without any discussion or explanation.  I was originally on 150mg per day and then reduced to 75mg (not without problems). Thereafter managed to reduce to 37.5 mg twice per day and then one 37.5mg per day. Each time I reduced I experienced withdrawal.  I recently stopped taking Effexor, on the advice of a Consultant. The withdrawal symptoms are terrible. I have electric shock like feelings in my head which travel down my arms whenever i move my eyes from side to side, extremely sensitive to sound, shaking, nausea, disorientation, vertigo, either insomnia or extreme sleepiness, nightmares, weakness, flu like symptoms. I have now reached day 6 off Effexor and no sign of the  withdrawal abating.  I am now seeking the help of a counsellor to assist me in coping with not only the withdrawal but the terrible mood swings.  My life has completely changed since taking and coming off this drug, and not for the better. I would say to anyone thinking about taking Effexor to think carefully before doing so and be aware of what you are going into.

Aside making me feel more depressed, I gained an enormous amount of weight, had blurry vision, felt weak all of the time, restless legs, arms, hands & throat; had less than no sex drive,  and my hair started to fall out (that was the last straw). Getting off of it s u c k s. The side effects were so bad, I was afraid to come off it completely so I cut down to the lowest dose for as long as I could until finally I stopped it altogether...but not before having the worst episode of blind rage I've ever had in my life, followed by anxiety attacks, brain shocks, and dizziness. Took almost two weeks after I stopped the drug completely to not feel any of the things above. Sure, I can be a depressed person (hence, why I take anti-depressants!) but Effexor made me an ultra-depressed crazy person and to be honest, i'm not sure how it has FDA approval. But again..this is just my experience, others have had success.

Gradually,the side effects started to out weigh the benefits.Extreme dry mouth,inability to cry at any time.(It,s just not normal to not feel sad EVER.)Absolutely no sex drive,which in itself was depressing.Getting off the drug was a horrible experience.The docs never seem to tell you that part of it.I started  at 75 mg/day and was increased to 150 mg.That was not good. I went back down to 75 mg and stayed there for a while.I finally got fed up with ""missing life"", so I tried to get off the drug.It was a slow ,difficult process.It took over a year, gradually cutting down.First 75 mg every other day to 50 mg every other day and then 50 mg every three days.At that point I would go as many days as I could possibly stand it before taking a 50 mg dose.The withdrawal symptoms were vertigo,confusion,and the ""Brain zaps"" that only someone who has gone thru this can actually relate to. I am finally done with this med although I still have some of the zaps now and again. Do not go on this drug unless you are willing to give up all feelings (good and bad) and are done with sex.I am now on hormone replacement therapy and feel great.I changed docs too becuase he thought Effexor was the wonder drug of the century and would not switch me to HRT."

In 2008, I was laid off and eventually could not afford health insurance or medication.  Effexor (no XR) was cheaper and available in a generic but it was not effective.  To go off Effexor XR is to dive into the black hole of insanity - confusion, depression, inability to reason (cook, pay bills, etc), 'brain zaps', suicidal thoughts and the belief that I would become homeless.  It was the scariest experience in my 20 years since diagnosis.  Fortunately I was able to get the drug from Wyeth and am again stable.  I do fear the next time I need to go off this drug for lack of funds or to change medications...just know that it will require medical intervention!

It worked very very well.  I did experience some weight gain (about 10 lbs) and loss of interest in sex.  However, I still feel that if you need it you have to take it.  There's no point in suffering when there is something that can immediately help. After reading countless ""caveats"" about coming off it, I weaned myself off very slowly and with direction from my Dr. I reduced my dosage by 37.5mg 1 month at a time.  IT WORKED VERY VERY WELL.  I experienced little to no withdrawel symptoms.  I've been off the med for about 10 weeks.  Sadly I'm beginning to have more episodes of feeling depressed; not being able to get out of bed, having little-to-no energy, and am probably going to go back on it.  I really wanted to be ""free and clear"" of the med and I'm not sure that it's possible. Some people have a chemical imbalance and it's beyond their control.  Sadly I'm feeling that I'm one of those people..."

It has changed my life and has worked wonders for me. I hardly ever have any episodes of anxiety or anxiety attacks like I did before and they were severe! Been on it for 10 years. The downside is definitely missing even 1 dose or trying wean off. It is horrible. Missing 1 dose makes me feel like I have the flu times a thousand. I wish I knew when I was prescribed this, just how terrible the withdrawals can be. As wonderful as it has been for me, it is scary to think what would happen if I got stuck somewhere w/o my Effexor!! Don't EVER try to stop taking this drug w/o consulting your doctor! I tried one time and made it for almost 4 agonizing days w/o my daily dose before I thought I was going to die.

I suddenly began having a dizziness that was unexplained.  Emotionally, I felt good though, and thought maybe it was time to get off the drug.  I reduced my dosage down to 37.5 for two weeks, then cut the few remaining pills in half for about 10 days.  What ensued from there has been a nightmare.  I was having severe brain shivers most of the day every day for over two weeks.  Brain shivers are like an electrical stimulus to your brain.  My emotions and sensitivity to light and sound were severe.  My doctor was totally unavailable to me during this process.  It has now been over a month and all of these symptoms are still happening, although to a lesser degree.  However, I believe this is a VERY dangerous drug and would recommend against starting it.  If you are on it, try switching to something less severe and then titrate off.  There is no way of knowing the length of time I will have to suffer with these symptoms and apparently there is no relief from them.

After about 4 years, I opted for anotber due to the horrific weight gain. My Dr. recommended Effexor CR. I started at 35 mg and went to 75 shortly afterwards which I was happy with. In January 2009, I opted to see if I was able to do without the meds. I slowly reduced my dosage from 75 to 35 over 5 months. By my sixth month, I was 100% antidepressant free. My withdrawal symptoms by weaning myself off slowly were minimal, but due to the high stress of my job and my minds tendency to make things much, much bigger and dramatic than what they really are I decided, along with my Dr.'s recommendation, to return to taking Effexor CR. The side affects such as sexual, weight gain, forgetfulness are minimual in comparison to being without it....at least at this time in my life. Maybe some day. Just not right now.

I also developed a severe anxiety disorder after coming off it 2 years ago that I have been struggling with ever since. Effexor's website says it is perfectly safe and not addictive. THIS IS A LIE.

The effects can be dramatic, I have two friends who suddenly and scarily became suicidal whilst under Effexor.

Within the last year I started sweating a lot, my hands shook more, and it became harder to think clearly and not get irritated and angry (even at 75 mgs). I could not work feeling this way and I quit my job, so I decided to get off Effexor when my insurance ran out.  Whoa! Talk about side affects! The doc gave me 37.5 mg pills to take for 2 weeks to taper off, and now I have been on zero Effexor for one week.. and I have major ringing in the ears, nausea, dizziness, shaking, constantly tired, can't sleep, and bizzare crying jags over little things that never bothered me before.  I am hoping that this will all subside within the next week or so.  I have to agree that the benefits of Effexor are not worth the withdrawal symptoms.  I hope and pray they are over soon.

It got me through one of the roughest years of my life.   However, getting off of it was nearly impossible.   I had the worse case of insomia that I have ever had when I tried to get off of it.  I had to taper it down very slowly. I started at 150mg and ended at 37.5mg.  Even on the 37.5 mg I had to start taking it every other day then twice a week before finally getting off of it just a few weeks ago.  It took me months to get wean myself off of it.   The bad news is, my father is dying and I just lost my job (no I am not making this up) so I may have to get back on it to deal with the depression.    To me the good things were worth having to wean myself off of it.

This also helped with nausea and vertigo in the early stages until enough accumulated in my system. The reverse happened when I was first  weaned off it.So taking it at night was right for me and it also kept me awake during the day so I slept better at night. However the weight gain, high blood pressure and cholesterol have caused me to decide that the side affects could possibly be more dangerous for me than the depression. Anyway I have decided to very gradually get off Efexor, again and hopefully forever, with the help of my doctor.I agree that it is most important to be as knowledgeable as possible before deciding to take it.

It was not what I believe to be depression that returned. No sleep for 3 days lead to my mind running 100 miles a minute while my body seemed to move in slomo. This is one serious drug.

I fly off the handle quite a bit. My husband would describe me as ""hyper"" a lot of the time.  I tried weaning off of this drug while increasing a new med - Wellbutrin - at the recommendation of my doctor.  The withdrawal from the effexor, once I was completely off of it - was HORRIBLE!  Brain zaps, dizziness, night terrors (even when taking an afternoon nap) - oh, and very very tired - I started just curling up on the bed and falling asleep once I was off of the Effexor. The Wellbutrin gave me serious stomach problems, so this doc said ""I don't want you taking anything (meaning anti-depressents) until we know what's going on with you.""  Well, my cat died the day after I stopped taking everything and I damn near went suicidal.  I mean I went completely beserk, had crying jags, etc.  Got back on EffexorXR (37.5 mg) immediately per my primary care physician's insistence. I have since found new medication psychiatrist who suggested that maybe the Effexor's effect on my norephinephrine was just too much for me.  At least at my current low Effexor dose 37.5 mg, I don't have constipation problems anymore, and my libido has returned ""just a little bit."" (thank goodness).  I'm ramping up on Zoloft again (per doc's suggestion) - it did wonders for me when I first started taking in in 1994-2006 (and I lost weight, too) so maybe it will help me again.  I sure need something to pull me out of my current depression.  But the Effexor WITHDRAWAL effects ARE HORRIBLE - and I'm a little bit scared of going completely off of it for that reason."

I feel like the old me before menopause began.  My husband & I can cuddle again without me having to pull away due to hot flashes!
I also was experiencing increased migraines before Effexor which I suspect was largely due to lack of sleep (and hormone flux because of menopause).  These too have been less frequent.  I have not noticed any weight gain with this product and I found I have lots and lots of energy again.  After reading the other reviews regarding addiction, I do intend to speak to my doctor about going back down to the 37.5mg level.  Even that level made a big difference in the night sweats.  I am not a proponent of taking pills for everything, but believe me I tried all the 'natural' remedies with no success."

You must take it at the same time of day (i take it after dinner)everyday to avoid drenching NIGHT SWEATS,headache and feeling like crying. I noticed WEIGHT GAIN of about 10 pounds over the last 2 years. Too bad it's so expensive. 
1175$Condition: Depression$2/9/2010 4:37:52 PM$Reviewer: SideEffex82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$2$1$"I was on Effexor XR for 8 years for depression/mild anxiety through the end of high school and through college. I had been on various dosages of Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil with either poor side effects (inability to orgasm) or poor effectiveness. Doc put me on 150mg of Effexor XR. It helped my depression, anxiety and libido but the side effects and withdrawl were horrible and TOTALLY debilitating! 

I was getting my prescriptions through MedCo's mail order system so it was very easy to be out of meds and at least 3 days from getting any more. The worst withdrawl symptom was a nauseous dizzy feeling in my head. I could not move around without feeling as though my brain were somewhat disconnected from my head. It would worsen with each day to the point of nearly vomiting! Let me be very clear here, I could not move my body without feeling like I was going to barf! And I have an iron stomach! 

Another serious effect that I have experienced is hand tremors. It has been 12 years since I began taking Effexor XR and 4 years since I stopped and my hands still shake, sometimes so bad that people ask me if I have Parkinson's Disease!! Most of the time people say nothing but look at me like I am a junkie! I have been to the Doc and they ran tests and have no explanation- even though I KNOW that I never had this problem until I went on Effexor XR. 

I would recommend this pill because it helped me overcome a severe depression but I caution strongly against it if you have a hard time keeping a pill schedule. 

The Doc's didn't want me to go off of the pill. They said depression was ""in my genes"" and I would fight it my whole life. Well, as a biologist, let me tell you that THAT is NOT always the case. I have been anti-depressant free for 4 years and I have never felt more clear, fresh, raw and happy than I do now. Sure there are bummers, sometimes every day. But I just focus on the good parts and count my blessings with my shakey fingers every moment I remember to! "

Lexapro was not helping ..maybe making it worse (according to a Federal study) I was on Lexapro...but my income decreased so I needed a generic. My shrink put me on generic Effexor. I did not know why immediately but my GI doctor figured out why I was getting nausea...it was due to effexor...he is a smart guy. After a few weeks the side effects passed.I no longer have highs or lows but can function without fear and anxiety. Unfortunately I am still falling victim to spells of obsessive thinking and acting on these after awhile. I do not have the daily OCD,...the trembling hand washing etc but get fixated on things or a course of action contrary to all the best advice. It has caused me problems and cost me money in the real world...plus a lot of humiliation. Being aware of my lack of awareness when I am in a spell causes me suicidal thoughts...probably just self-pity but I am an adult and soemtimes cannot find real reasons to live...on the contrary I find more reasons to be dead. I attend 12 step meetings however and have listened to folks like me who after years realized their life had completely turned around until they were ""happy, joyous and free"". I also hear at these meetings about the ones who self-destructed, either immediately thru suicide or slowly thru alcohol and drugs. I do not think God wants me to kill myself but I do wish he would fast-track my spiritual emotional, mental, physical, situational and locational recovery.

Effexor okay but Lexapro made me feell better and Celexa really helped me  fast when I went into severe depression. I would like to be completely drug-free but do not want to be the same person I was. Have not put on any weight but it is hard to tell about side effects because I take other drugs as well.  "

My mother also gained about that much weight, but the dr. kept insisting it was my diet or exercise, neither of which changed. Most of the weight was in my abdomen, making me look about 6-7 months pregnant. She put me on Topamax to help lose the weight. Now I have side effects from that as well.

After having lived a life barraged with social anxiety disorder coupled with depression, I had finelly gotten to the point of going to my doctor and asking for help. The best way I could express my condition to him, was by saying,""Something's wrong."" I was loaded with self-doubt, could not make ANY decisions with a measure of confidence, had paranoid thoughts on a near daily basis, and suffered from enormously heavy feelings of guilt (reliving bad scenes & bad decisions I've made  in my lifetime.) Was started on 75 mgs. or Effexor XR five months ago. My life changed instantly!! It helped with the anxiety within a couple of hours, and all the irrational negative thinking has subsided.Downsides are involved though. For me, there were two.
And they were major for me. Libido prblems and extreme tiredness. Both issues have been minimalized through pinpointing MY correct doseage, and my body adapting to the medication. After topping-out at 225mgs.(way too much for me) I have zeroed in on my proper dose; maintaining the wonderful effectiveness of the medication, and nearly ridding myself of the unpleasant side effects. I say nearly because they are still there... however, they are very slight. Also, I did wean myself off completely back in Nov. and DID NOT have any of the horribles effects I am reading about on here. I DID however experience ""my old self"" immediately! Needless to say, I restarted the medication and am having huge success on the smallest doseage of 37.5 mgs. per day. This is enough for me, and I have a Keith Richards' like constitution!! That being said, I am amazed that such a low level dose has affected my life in such a miraculous way!!!"

 I have tried all kinds of anti depression meds and the Effexor XR is the only one that has worked for me. I've taken it for 6years now and the only problem I have noticed while taking it is my weight gain but over all I feel great.

However, if you are considering this medciation, you should be aware that it is very important not to miss a dose.  It causes a very uneasy/uncomfortable feeling...kind of like a hangover, but light-headed and dizzy.  Even being a little late taking it can cause these symptoms so you should get in the habit of taking it at the same time every day.  Another thing to be careful of...don't stand or raise up to quickly or you can become very light headed

Paxil-made me sleep my life away. Zoloft-felt like a zombie. Wellbutrin-made me extremely moddy. Celexa-awful neck pain & my jaw would clench. The only problem I had with effexor was how huge-dialated my pupils got. I hate to sound so picky but my eyes are greenish-hazel so if my pupils dialated, it was really obvious and I felt really self-consious about it. I'm taking about like my pupils were almost as big as my eye. I thought people might think i was on some illegal drugs, so I just decided to go off the meds. WOW, major withdrawl symptoms. It's hard to say, if I had dark colored eyes, I would def stay with this med. I hadn't felt so good in a long time, and it worked awesome for both depression and anxiety! Will try Lexapro next

If you are even late on a dose, it starts with the creepy lightheadedness that makes you feel off...then comes the nausea.  After 4 days off one time (due to finances), i felt like dying.

I was without it for a few months from an insurance problem and had to go off cold turkey and I will say that it was terrible for the withdrawal, though nothing as bad as the horror stories I have read from other people.  The biggest problem for me was not the withdrawal however, it was that nothing else that I tried worked for me.  I wound up fixing the problem with the insurance and went back on it.  Even knowing what the withdrawal entails, if the benefit outweighs the risk... that's the basis for all meds.  My experience with this med has been a lot more positive than the stories I have read. Regardless if people say that it's addictive and regardless if I ever wind up having to go through the withdrawals again if my insurance drops coverage again... this is an essential med for me and I will take advantage of the benefits it brings for as long as I am able to.  Without it I am a crying miserable wreck and completely overwhelmed by my depression.  With it there are still depression factors but at a level I can live with.  I do take four other psych meds along with the effexor and my current dose is 150mg/day.  Just for reference, the other meds are buspar, klonopin, seroquel and lamictal.  No benefit from trials of prozac, wellbutrin or celexa.

Up untill she took effexor and when she was on prozac our friends and family thought of us as love birds. 

We had a great sex life and that completely disappeared withing the first two months. She became angry, impulsive, agitated towards me and the rest of the family. She thinks it is working. She tells her shrink that it is working. She sees her shrink for 30 minutes every 3 months and he renews her prescription without checking for side effects with her family. 

If you are thinking of taking this drug, give yourself a going away party because you will be leaving everyone who knows and loves you you will be replaced by an entirely different personality. Here is how Weyth promoted this drug through falsified testing and paying for positive reports from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/health/17depres s.html http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22237 http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/12/18/dear-me-ne meroff-wrote-himself-about-payment-for-effexor-ar ticle/ 

This medication is addictive! Addiction - Big Pharma marketing calls it "" discontinuation syndrome"" which the shrinks don't tell you about before you start taking it. Agitation, anger, impulsiveness, memory loss, loss of cognative ability and weight gain. The manufacturer stresses the opposite - weight loss - but that is true in young women. It makes it appear that women are getting a feel good pill and a diet pill, when in fact many post menopausal women gain 30 - 50 pounds.

It caused vertigo as well as horrible sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, eye pain from the light, and the worst mood swings ever! My husband had to take me to the ER because he found me on the kitchen floor and all the chairs were knocked over, apparently I had fallen. I couldn't remember anything at all until an hour after I had taken a dose of the effexor which the doctor had given me. 

Also.  Since I have been on the effexor, I have become an anti-social zombie. I barely get out of bed and my already lack of motivation turned into a lack of life period.

I read many reviews before starting the drug, and I was scared to death of all the reviews that said the drug had horrendous side effects, and was absolutely impossible to get off of.  Well, I have experienced just about every side effect imaginable, that I will outline below for you.  But, I will never experience the effects of withdrawing from the drug, because I have absolutely no intention of getting off the drug.  My life is now phenomenally enjoyable, which I will also outline below.  I'm going to give you complete details, because I wish someone had maybe done the same about a year ago when I was searching desperately for answers to my many questions.  Here goes. ME: I am a forty-something male, married, two sporty kids.  Profession requires public speaking and frequent client interaction.  I was a professsional athlete and continue to work out almost every day.  PROBLEM: I've always been extremely anxious around people, although few people knew it.  It was a constant struggle being around people other than those I knew really well.  I was also nervous talking to important clients or making important presentations, but, again hid it.  The reality, though, was I was not enjoying myself, avoided all such situations, and therefore didn't excel at many things I did, despite the fact that I am a very smart, witty and caring person (don't mean to sound vain - just saying I've always had the tools to be an extremely successful person, but my anxiety/depression squelched everything).  My anxiety occassionally elevated to full blown panic attacks where it was obvious to the people I was with that I was nervous.  I know now that I was experiencing related depression as well. At times I would get into a complete funk, tired and exhausted, despite the fact I was getting lots of sleep.   I would be in a fog. CURE: My GP prescribed ativan at first, since my primary c

I had started taking prozac about 6 months after my daughter was born, stayed on that about 1 year but experienced weight gain, stayed sleepy. went off that about a year, then started having anxiety again, crying at the drop of a hat. My doc recommended effexor.  I asked to stay on lowest possible dose, and have really liked this mecication.  the only side effects I noticed when I 1st started were extreme ""energy"" esp. when I 1st woke up, and some trouble sleeping, but I was already having trouble with that. That subsided quickly enough, the only other thing that was significant was headaches, but I can't say for sure that it was from med.  They have stopped too. I feel effexor has allowed me to be the person I'm meant to be.  I feel very happy and ""normal"" again, even better that ever.  The few side effects I have/had were not enough for me to stop taking it.  A co-worker quit her effexor cold turkey and told me "" you've got to get off that stuff"" story similar to other posts here.  My take is--don't stop any meds like that cold turkey, that's just dumb.  And everyone is different, but I would stay on as low a dose as possible, I think It makes it easier if you do decide to stop.  I wish I didn't have to take anything, but since I do, I like this med.  With prozac I felt sluggish, and was ravenous all the time, but not with this.  I feel very energetic most of the time, and don't worry like I used to.  But there are alot of meds out there, try something different if one doesn't do it for you."

Beginning this drug, I was vomiting right away, so make sure you take it with food. The side effects get better as you continue taking it, and rather quickly. After taking this drug for 2 months though, the drug was helping immensley with the anxiety, but making my depression much worse! I began hallucinating and hearing voices & whispers, and became very suicidal. I slept alot, had zero energy or desire to do anything. I wouldn't shower for days and couldn't even get basic things done. I am now weaning off of it to start something new (Celexa), and the weaning has been fine except that I notice that I am much more aggitated and irritable, and anger very quickly. Anxiety attacks are coming back as well. I have back problems, so I also take muscle relaxers, pain killers, and nerve relaxers as well. Not sure if there is an interaction going on? It's very hard to be patient with finding a drug to work for you. I am half tempted to try the medical marijuana to see if that helps with pain and anxiety?

Was on Prozac later, then Lexapro.  With Lexapro, I felt a lot better as far as moods and swings went, but after taking it for 4 years, it leveled off and worked less and less.  Then I took Effexor.  
I feel a lot better, and more level mood wise.  I've been suicidal since age 14, and am now 54.  I've gotten past the pain part, so 'leaving town' isn't the issue it once would have been.  IOW, it'd be a whole lot easier to do myself in now than before, were it not for wife and kids who would take it as something their fault.
I liked Lexapro, but it stopped working out.  Effexor works, but all the posts and comments are scaring me.  What to do?  stop and die, or keep taking it and die, or at least deal with powerful side effects, while the other part of effexor allows a better life for the time being.  A pill for every need- medical legacy of the USA.  Just a wholly BIZARRE plight to be in.  Here I thought that other stuff I was experiencing was some other pill. sweating, lucid dreams, strange physical sensations, 'blank spots' during the course of the day or workday, strange physical pains or feelings.  Maybe back to Lexapro.
Thank you all for posting, for your experiences have led me to think about other realms that had not occurred to me...  Just so bizarre!  And yeah, even the sex dept has gone south"

I started out with Prozac and other meds years ago with little effect. I was prescribed Effexor XR several years ago and I've experienced wonderful results...Before the medication I was having suicidal thoughts and cried all the time. 
I've also detoxed from the medication a few times and that can b no fun. However my MD worked out a detox plan with another med that made coming off the drug a breeze...so speak with ur physician  might ...I related to the post about brain zaps ...or something along those lines."

I tried Zoloft, then Lexapro, then Paxil, & finally Effexor XR. I have been very satisfied with Effexor XR, 75mg. I tapered off a couple of yrs. ago by skipping a day, and then taking one 75mg. pill, etc. for a wk. or 2.  I did not have any bad withdrawal symptons by doing it that way. Then a couple of yrs. ago in June '07, more troubling things happened in my life, so I went back on it again. I have extreme fatigue, but I don't know if it is because of Effexor XR.

It's hard to remember how or if it was effective in the beginning. I have been batteling SEVERE depression for over 10 yrs and spent 5 of those yrs in bed. I've been on all kinds of meds in different combos and ultimately came off everything 2 yrs ago except for the effexor. I CANT stOP. If I go even 2 days without it the brain zaps are terrible. Fortunately I don't seem to be having any of the other side effects many of you have talked about ie no wt gain or moodiness that I can see but how do you differentiate the moodiness of the med effect from the symptoms of the depression itself? If I really knew that ex was still helping me I wouldn't mind it so much but I just don't know if it really is helping or if I'm staying on it to avoid the withdrawl of stopping. Also I don't have insurence and it's expensive to stay on it just to stop the withdrawl. Still I have found that most other meds I have tried have had worse side effects. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to meds now that I have tried so many but with some meds I would forget what I was saying half way through a sentence. It was awful. If I try again to get off ex I would do it over a 1 yr period. I don't know what to do. I'm still classified as severly depressed but at least I'm working and interacting with people again. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

Yes, I have side effects--mild sweatiness, loss of apetite, the need to be busy and enjoying semi-solitude. Every once in a the combination ""fails"" and I start down the ""slippery slope"". I have successfully
been weaned off Effexor under the therapist's guidance and I never experienced the brain pain that other reviewers felt. Truthfully, I'd rather have the side effects than be in bed in a fetal position OR WORSE. I have accepted I will have to be on Effexor XR for the rest of my life. With few exceptions, I am having the happiest years of my life (spending many of them being depressed and untreated.)   "

I decided to wean myself off this drug as I experienced weight gain & SEVERE withdrawl symptoms.  I have been tapered down to the 37.5 mg level (I had been up to 300mg) but I can not quit the drug completely!!!  Even at this low dose, I experience the extreme effects I did when I forgot my medication while on vacation.  One side effect I did not realize I had was a complete lack of interest in sex!  Now that I am down to the lower dose, my sex drive is back thankfully & my energy has increased.  I have lost 15 pounds due to diet & exercise since lowering my dose.  My advice to others is STILL the same!!  DO NOT accept this drug from anyone, even a doctor!!  Since I have been unable to remove myself completely from this drug, my opinion about this is even stronger. There are so many alternatives, do yourself a favor & JUST SAY NO!!!

1352$Condition: Depression$10/26/2009 4:14:39 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I began taking this med in '08 after trying lexapro and wellbutrin, which did not work for me. I took 75 mg once a day (effexor xr). AFter one week I immediate felt relief and felt like my depression was being treated! I felt wired at first, dry mouth, nausea...the side effects it states you will have. But they eventually went away. I stayed on this med for 6mths, but since I planned to have a baby, I went off of it. The only withdrawal symptmos I had were the brain zaps, but I gradually withdrew the amount I was taking by breaking open the capsule. I only had to do this for 2 weeks. Now after having the baby, I am on this med again...this time on the generic form. Same initial symptoms. I have been taking it for 3 weeks now and I already feel like my head is clearer and I'm not as angry. I think with these types of medicines you have to just try to see if they do work for you or not. Just b/c someone else had awful reactions or withdrawals does not mean you will! With any of these drugs that affect you physiological system, you do risk that possibility of withdrawal symptoms!

1359$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/22/2009 9:21:30 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I did not take Effexor XR very long because it hospitalized me with SEVERE DEPRESSION and SUICIDAL THOUGHTS at a very low dose. I realize that I just had a very bad reaction to this drug, but it was the worst reaction I have had from any of the medications I have been on for Bipolar Depression (close to 15). I now take Cymbalta, which is also a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and it has been one of the best medications I have ever been on. My advice for anyone who is considering taking Effexor XR is to look out for a severe reaction involving depression and suicidal thoughts. I wasn't sure if my reaction was to Effexor XR or another new drug I was taking, but it turned out to be Effexor XR. I thought I could just tough it out through the side effects and that it would maybe get better, but that was a horrible mistake that put me in the hospital.  Just be sure to use caution when starting this medication!

My doctor prescribed XR as it was the latest and greatest drug out there.  Initially it worked wonders.  For the first time I could breathe freely everyday, I was productive, and never nervous.  A few years in I decided this wasnt something that I wanted to take forever, especially since my MD warned me it wasnt for long term use and it should have changed my chemistry.  I weaned myself off, which I expected to be painful based on others experiences, and it was.  That wasnt the worst part though.  After withdrawal ended I was left feeling like I had no brain.  Years later I still feel the same way.  I have no memory, I'm always at a loss for words, and I can't begin to articulate my thoughts.  Effexor changed my life for the good for a very small amount of time, but the damage it has done has been much much worse.  I can only hope its not permanent.  Be very careful when taking this drug.  Think long and hard about the side effects, because there will be some, and what you would do if it fundamentally changed you if you decided to stop taking it.

I did get those ""brain zaps"" at the lower part of the back of my head.  Also a little bit dizzy at times.

Pretty severe postpartum depression. Worked very well and was happy with the results for the next 2 years. 

At one point my Dr tried to wean me off, but soon realized it was a bad idea. Within one week I had serious thoughts of suicide...did not actually attempt but the desire was very strong.

Now I feel like a prisoner to this medication. I experience erratic mood swings, paranoia, apathy, no sex drive, jitters. My body/brain won't let me sleep until very late at night, so I'm always tired and lethargic.
I was once an outgoing person, and now i'm reclusive and anti-social.

I believe Effexor is a great short term solution to combat depression and potpartum. I wish I would have known about the side effects of long term use because I do feel it was a factor in my divorce."

Great medication just remember going off of this is like having drug withdrawals.

Noticed a difference right away, moved out, got a good job, better decision making.  Now not noticing a lot of difference other than not as bad depression.  Side effects noticed, sweating A LOT more, vivid dreams, tired a lot, occasional headaches.  Missing a dose, NOT A GOOD IDEA! 24 hours are manageable, 48 hours- mind numbing migrane. Had to drive home at night with sunglasses one because of sensitivity to light.  Only on 75 mg, not sure may need higher dose but nervous.

It's not some great ""happy"" pill.  Biggest complaint is NO sex drive at all! Start to get off the med & sex drive comes back. Cannot just stop taking this! I felt the worst in my life when tried to quit taking it; zapping feeling, crying, very angry, nausea, headaches.....list goes on & on.
There is no generic for the XR formula. I had to cancel my health ins., so if I want this med I have to pay $160 per month for it.  Currently I am seeing if Wyeth (manufacturer) will let me have it at no cost. Have to go to their website & print out application. Take it to your doctor to do her/his part & mail it in.  
I'll know in 5-7 days if I can get it free.

I am now 55 years old and have few side effects from the medication and menopause.  My OB suggested I go off the medication and set me up with a plan to slowly withdraw from the medication.
I am through my first week reducing the dosage and I have had a challenging time with hot flashes, and anxiety.  I was put on the generic form of Effexor and not sure if it's due to these symptoms or the change in dosage. 

I have to admit I've had minimal mood swings during the past 7 yrs, which has been a blessing, as I have a very stressful job and don't intend to retire until I'm 65 years old.

Was told that my arthritis was getting worst. After returning home after job lost and no insurance, I weaned off effexor XR because I could not afford it. To my surprise my pain in my hips and legs was gone. I could walk in the park and climb hills.  I could not believe it. It is not listed as a side effect.

It is FDA approved up to 225mg/day, but many doctors prescribe way higher than this with good results.  I saw one post on here where the person said the drug didn't work and they were at 37.5mg/day.  Yes, the drug will have virtually no effect on you at that low dosage!!

I've been on it a year and I'm at 300mg/day.  It is a wonderful medicine, but I don't like the sweating and the fact that it raises blood pressure.  People, DO NOT trust your primary care or family doctor to know about these psychoactive drugs.  They mean well, but a Psychiatrist is where you need to go for the guys who know everything about psychoactive drugs.  Also, I am not a doctor, nor do I work for a drug company.  I just wanted to throw some facts out there for people to use so that they can be helped.

Missed a dose, here and there, and the withdrawal was intense.  The electric shock feeling was terrifying the first time. I complained to my doctor ans was told that the ""shock"" feeling might actually be a plummet in saratonin levels.  So, on my own, I cut back, first to 75mg per day and then half again.  I was able to go dose free for 2-3 days before the ""shock"" would come and I'd take a pill.  I continued just treating the ""shocks"" as they came until I was pill free for days, then weeks at a time.  If you are ready to wean off Effexor, get your doctor to lower and break up your dosage (instead of 2x75mg per day, ask for 4x32.5). This will help you begin slowly skipping one dose and so on.  Effexor is a fantastic medication and it doesn't have to be a nightmare (literally) to come off it.  Pay attention to your ""shocks"" or crashes as you lower your dosage and treat only when you feel them.  It will work.  I was completely off the medication within three months and I had very little hardship. "

My ADD symptoms were a strong tendency to ""spin off"" into depression when facing manageable but tough problems. And also when I was exhausted by overwork! The depression became bad enough at 26 to cause me to take a year off from everything. I've been on many, many drugs; most worked for a while, some never worked, but none were too bad as far as side effects. After Prozac ""pooped out"" on me, I was put on Effexor, 75 mg twice a day at first, then building up to 300 mg XR once a day. The med seemed to work great the first several months. But then my energy dropped, which led me to cut back exercising. Over the next couple of years, I gained 80 pounds! After batteries of tests and numerous nutritional/diet solutions, I peaked out at about 280 pounds. I'm 5' 7"" tall! My doctors concluded my weight gain was due to the Effexor. SO I got off - but OH GOD was it bad! It took nearly a month for the drug to ""clear"" my system. During that time (and especially the first two weeks), I had shakes, tremors, problems sleeping. Worse, there was this strange effect: my head felt like it was being whirled around, quickly, like you might experience on an amusement park ride. And I would get what others have described as ""brain zaps"" - it felt like I was getting a sudden surge of electricity through my brain (without pain). My Psych put me on Wellbutrin after the first two weeks. That got some of my energy back, and improved my mood. At the end of a month, all the weirdness stopped. The Wellbutrin helped me to feel more like myself. This drug is effective up front - but I'm convinced it should be used temporarily for severe cases. Then a patient can switch off to another med once things are more ""under control.""  "

My depression was under control within 2 months, but my dose had to go higher as I was experiencing withdrawl even when taking the drug. It does not help my adhd and has even been antagonistic to my impulsivity and restlessness. Once I became comfortable on it, at 28, we found out that I have severe secondary hypertension and might have a stroke if I stay on Effexor. I'm in the process of weaning to Cymbalta with the option of going back on a stimulant now, and I feel better already. Know that this drug is definitely a lifer, and it does help control depression and anxiety very well, but to keep an eye on your blood pressure, pay strict attention to your diet, and excercise, even if you don't have the motivation or energy. That's what saved my life.

I would urge all patients to seek treatment other than Effexor & tell doctors that if they feel they MUST prescribe it, to let the patient in on the symptoms they will experience when they get off the drug, or even miss a dose.

It's been 1 year now And I'm down to 1/2 of a 37.5  pill a week,down from 225 a day. If I had of known that this loss of controll of my own life  is what it would have done to  me I would have put this effort into finding a support group or some other form of non drug related help. Life may have been difficult but I had feelings, Happiness saddness and love I wasn't numb.Life is getting better with time,The side effects are leaving day by day and I cried for the first time in 5 years.(tears of joy)It was better than any drug getting me through life.So please research this drug find people who are taking it or who have taken it before you decide.It is a miracle drug but it is also the drug from HELL.Good luck

I finally got off of it with 2 ER visits and the worst withdrawal symptoms I could ever imagine experiencing.  I have been off now for a month and am still dealing with some of the withdrawal symptions that are still hanging in there.  Doctors don't tell you how terribly addictive this drug is so be super careful and really decide if you want to become so addicted and dependent on a drug. When I was on it I had to take it to the exact hour every day or I'd start getting withdrawal symptoms.  Just be very careful with this one.

The withdraws were horrific, I was paranoid, suicidal, delusional, and I am lucky I had a great support network.

Its been 8 days without the drug and I still have a hard time concentrating, I can't move quickly or I'll become nauseous, I dry heave in the morning or sometimes randomly, I am SO FREAKIN HOT and I can't cool down, I sleep all day (even at work - thank goodness for a wellness room), I've got muscle spasms, ""brain zaps"" where its like the world does a shuffle inside my skull...DO NOT GO ON THIS DRUG UNLESS YOU HAVE SERIOUSLY DEEP, DEEP DEPRESSION. There are much better options out there. I have been on 6 other medications, this one working the best for ""moods"" but I had no libido and was more or less numb for the entire time and the withdrawal is not even remotely worth it. It almost negates anything good Effexor ever did for me. If given a choice, I'd go back to Wellbutrin. That said, I've opted out of the antidepressant route all together and am going to a Naturopath and dealing with my issues through CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). 
Please really consider your reasons for needing to be on medication and how long you think you may be on it. Effexor, if it has to be used, should only be as a very last resort. VERY LAST - it is like withdrawing from heroine, and i was on the absolute lowest prescibable dosage!!"

I think that it may be a mildly addictive drug.

As regards coming off the drug,what I remember most were the ""brain zapping"" jolts, like an electric current flashing through your head.These passed quickly but are unpleasant.

Side effects: Sweating,teeth-grinding,mild euphoria,intermittent libido, problems with sleeping.

I'm back on the drug again now and Iknow whn to cut down on the strength/frequency of the dosage when I feel high after a couple of days.

Overall, it helped me when I was in a very poor mental state but remember:

The drug is going to affect everyone in their own way.Make your own decision, Talk to your doctor and READ THE BLOODY LABEL before taking this, or any, drug.The Internet means that there is little excuse for ignorance,but exercise caution.

Best of luck to you sll and the drug is only a part of recovery."

I was working in a stressful environment, and I realized that my depression was getting worse, like a heavy weight that kept getting heavier.  The effexor has helped with that, but I found it does not keep my anxiety levels down, so I take it in combination with a low dose of paroxitine for anxiety.

I went through a lot of doctors, therapists, group and medicine to get to the normal state I am in today.  One out of the five therapists I experienced was effective.  Group, for me, was useless.  I take 225 mg of Effexor XR once a day and a light dose of Klonopin twice a day.  That, combined with putting my foot down and taking charge of my life made all the difference.  I am a very happy, in charge, successful person today due to my medication and life adjustments. 
1481$Condition: Other$8/15/2009 3:13:47 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"I have suffered from severe fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome since 1983.  By nature, the disorder is resistant to treatment; as such, I have tried many different drugs in a desperate attempt to get well. I discovered that an antidepressant which reacts on both 5-HT & NE works best, and out of the three currently marketed, Effexor XR (150mg) worked best for me by far. It does have one colosal drawback, however; it is extremely expensive. Without insurance, 90 capsules, 150mg, in the US will set you back over $400. Cymbalta's efficacy compares favorably, but it's price also compares to Effexor XR 150mg caps. I tried milnacipran when it was only available in Europe, without success. In any case, if you are trying to overcome severe CFS, you're in for the fight of your life. GOOD LUCK!"

I ran out of these once and had a horrific experience with the immediate withdrawal. When I was able to get my medication a couple of days later I tried taking 1/2 of my prescribed dose (due to the scare of the withdrawal). I am prescribed two 150mg caps per day. I found one cap per day was no effective in treating my depression, so I went back to my full dose and felt much better. I have found it is useful in treating many disorders - many of which I have and my doctors have been pleased I am already taking Effexor to help with these. This would include lessening hot flashes, as well as lessening pain.

The anxiety pretty much disappeared.  However, I caution everyone to do your research before deciding to take this drug or any like it, and if you can possibly get through it without meds even better. If your anxiety is not that bad than I think xanax is much better and safer with no withdrawls because it's a fast-acting medication that leaves your system quickly.  I've recently ""weaned"" myself off Effexor and  while doing so experienced dizziness, moodiness, wierd brain/eye movement stuff, nervousness, did not sleep well for a few days, and tiredness which lasted about a week.  I plan to use the xanax as a PRN but so far have not had to use it, I also started to work out regularly a few years ago (martial arts) which I think helps the anxiety and is a much better alternative to medications."

Pain, extreme bloating, gurgling, pressure in the abdomen. It affects my life to the point that I do not even go out that much anymore. It is unbearable.  So, after awhile, I figured out that every time I stopped the Effexor XR, my gut problems returned.  I then have to go back on this medication.  I know that the gut is made up of 95% serotonin. Therefore, my gut area has become addicted to this medication.  I wish I could go off of it, but after trying many times, I must stay on it.  I sure hate to depend on this drug to keep my gut stable.

The medicine worked great the first time for my extreme anxiety of everyday life.  I lived in a constant state of panic.  Yes, I agree the side effects can be terrifying and cause more anxiety.  I dealt with an increase heart rate and felt very nervous the first week both times.  However, I know this medicine works.  The first time on effexor xr for more than a year; I experienced the terrible effects if I missed a dose.  But, I also know whats its like not to even want your two precious children come towards you because they made nervous. I went back on the effexor when I also lost my fourteen year old daughter to Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.  When you almost lose a child you realize its time to quit being young and stupid and think you can handle things on your own.  I would rather deal with some unwanted side effects and unpleasant feelings than to not enjoy my childrens life. Plus, I noticed the way I lived in fear affected my children.  And my daughter has shown signs of the same anxiety.  I realize getting help means helping to teach my children to enjoy and embrace everyday God gives us.  And if I am having a bad effexor day, I except that its not a good day and know tomorrow is a new day. Also, taking a 0.5 mg Xanax helps control the side effects when starting effexor xr.  It helps with the nervousness and rapid heart rate.  Took it three times a day the first week when starting and reduced the xanax til 2 a day and sometimes those are just half a pill.  Ask your dcotor about something to take the edge off when starting a effexor because it takes years or more for our nerves to get bad; so it takes the effexor some time to undo the damage our nerves has caused(there is no shame in it).

I sought out help in my final year of college. The Health Center DR put me on this and it worked. It worked for me for the whole time. There was one lul where watching a movie with a lighter in my hand (as i just lite a candle While watching 1408) the fire scene came on and i thought to myself... I could light this lighter and drop my hand and it would look like the movie. (I never have thought like that EVER) I was already working on coming off this drug as I was ALWAYS sweating and I wanted to end the medication life. Every night was filled with sweat, all winter long I was sweating, ACTUALLY I didnt mind it because I was warm when it was Cold. The other side effect I got was if I missed my dose even by 3 hours if I was walking I which ever direction i would turn that hand would go numb. The weaning off was not too hard, but I took it slow with an actual physician, I went down 37.5mgs each month. When it came to the end I felt like crap for about a week, the sweating ended after about a month. It has now been out of my system since March 09 and its July09. I look back at the last year and a lot of it, was a blur due to this medication.

I had mild relief but, still had dailey headaches. About 4 years ago my doctor recommended Botox injections. We found that the combination of Effexor and the botox injections (every 3 months) was the winning combination. After 47 odd years of severe to incajpacitating migraines, I AM FINALLY HEADACHE FREE. I take one 250 mg Effexor in the morning and another at bedtime. As to side effects, I can't comment as I'm on several other medications with the same side effects, namely dry mouth and eyes.  However, it's more than worth it to only have occassional. normal headaches (like when it's approaching time for the botox) and very rarely a severe one.

I could actually see something happen- like i noticed that i was changing, and i was back to my old self again. Then about a few months later it just stopped working. IDKY- it just did. and now my episodes have came back, and they are stronger. Not to mention I get tired- a LOT easier now and can't get enough sleep- even when i take it just before bed. I also find myself having way more panic attacks, so the doc has upped the RX and decided to try piggy backing with another. So we shall see how this one goes! I mean it really did work- and hopefully it will again.

I had no side effects, except for a 40 pound weight gain over the 4 yrs that I was on it. The weight gain was bad enough, but worse than that is trying to get off this drug.

Within 30 minutes I had stopped sighing to get my breath. It is truly a miracle drug for me, as I have always had depression with several episodes of clinical depression.

Decided life's too short to live with depression and anxiety.  Thank God for Effexor.

As long as I am on it I am very much in control and have no anxiety at all. Once a Dr. tried to take me off of it and it was the worst week of my life, so I agree totally with the comments related to the withdrawl issues. Also I travel a lot overseas and a couple of times I have either forgotten to pack it or it was in my luggage that did not arrive on time. If you are on a high dosage it can be difficult to get foreign Dr's to prescribe your normal dosage, so triple check that it is in your carry-on before you leave.

My doctor is weaning me off while trying something new (Cymbalta). So far, so good, but we are taking it in baby steps. Once before, she tried weaning me off it and I just had to give up and stay on it because of the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. The so-called ""brain zaps"" were horrible. I thought I was going to die. I had the worst of both worlds: depression increasing as withdrawal symptoms were getting worse. I am hoping for an easier transition.

1567$Condition: Depression$7/9/2009 3:22:20 PM$Reviewer: difficulty weaning off, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$2$1$This medication worked well for me while taking it. If I missed a dose by even a few hours I would begin to get dizzy and have odd sensations in my brain. When I attempted to wean off the medication I had a lot of trouble. The Dr. lowered my dose to the lowest doseage and I did that for a while with minimal dizziness and odd sensations but everytime I tried to skip a day and get on that portion of the weaning off I would get terrible dizziness, bumping into things, hearing a creaking noise in my brain and having memory difficulties. My balance was entirely off. I did the one day inbetween for longer than my Dr. originally anticipated. The Dr. said he has never seen a patient have such difficulty weaning off a medication. I missed 2 days of work over the course of this and am on vacation as I write this. I haven't taken the medication at all in 4 days and the problems are fairly minimal. This has been more difficult to quit than quiting smoking. It concerns me that a medication can alter some process in the brain that when removing the medication from the system, following the process of doing so, causes such severe changes in my natural chemestry. I don't know if this experience is unique to me but if someone has difficulties with medications I would avoid this one if there is a different choice.

If a dose was missed or late, I would immediately feel ""shocks"" throughout my entire body; like I was being electrocuted. It has been the most difficult and worst experience of my life to come off of these drugs.  It has taken several months for the withdrawals to stop even though I have been slowly weaning myself off.  During this time I have been extremely angry, self destructive and suicidal.  I truly did not think I would make it.  The coming off effexor part has been so terrible that I cannot remember if it worked for me for all those years or not.  My doctor did not offer any support except to say that ""everyone goes through the ""shock"" feelings...You just have to deal with it"".  Obviously she had never been through this as I am sure most doctors will never get themselves hooked on these drugs.  I did not know what to do.  If it weren't for my husband & family I am 90% sure I would have killed myself.  I will never allow my body to become addicted to these types of medications again.  Please do not take the first doctor's prescription and believe that he/she has your best interest in mind.  Please seek second or third opinions.  Drug companies offer incentives to doctors for selling their ""drug"" and as we all know, anti-depressants are the trendy, hot drug and there is so much competition the pharmaceutical companies have to push doctors to prescribe their brand.  I am not saying that medication should never be used; it helps many, many people - just PLEASE protect yourself. I am telling you now, if you start Effexor XR, you will end up taking it everyday for the rest of your life or you will go through the worst pain, depression, anger you will ever experience trying to get off Effexor XR AND you cannot do it by yourself - you need someone to watch out for you."

Effexor XR was, at one time, the best anti-depressant I had ever taken in terms of mood symptoms.  I did have some gastrointestinal side-effects; diarrhea and stomach-aches.

After approx. 4 years though, the effect from the Effexor XR diminished and I had to take an increased dose, which brought more side-effects and less impact on elevating my mood.  If I ever missed a dose of Effexor XR or took it a bit late, my head would feel dizzy and horrible.  I went off the medication twice.  Once, (a former) doctor did not have another anti-depressant for me to switch too and that was a nightmare, both with bad side-effects and mood issues.  The second (and final) time I discontinued the Effexor XR, I started Pristiq and my new doctor helped make a very smooth transition by decreasing the Effexor XR and increasing the Pristiq.  So, overall, Effexor XR may prove very effective, but may have some side-effects.     "

DO NOT TAKE!!!I have watched my mother, who has never taken a recreational drug in her life struggle with this drug almost killing her (literally) from the withdrawl symptoms. She began taking it to treat her hot flashes and depression and built up to 225mg. All was well and wonderful, that is until she ran out of insurance, lost her company and could no longer afford the outrageously expensive drug. She stopped taking the drug and began to feel like she was shutting down, physically and mentally. I have struggled with opiate addiction for a few years now and i think there is no worse feeling than the withdrawl you experience when quitting. that was until i saw my mom go through this. she went to the hospital for what she was feeling (not knowing it was effexor withdrawl) and they told her that her body was literally shutting down. Once she started telling them the medication and dose she was on, they knew right away it was the effexor. since then she has only been able to ween down to 75mgs, due to the fact that YOU CAN LITERALLY DIE FROM THE WITHDRAWL OF THIS DRUG. She feels too awful when she tries to take any lower of a dose. She feels like she cant control any mental functions, she feels out of body, horrific nightmares, can't sleep right, complete physical drain, awful rages. And thats just the symptoms that wont actually kill you!!!Just take the time to research the class action lawsuit against Wyeth.

I gained over 35lbs and had never before had a weight problem. Getting off the medication is not easy. You really have to ween off of it over several weeks. My side effects with getting off of this drug were dizziness, headaches, sweating, nausea, shocking sensations etc. decreasing it to 37.5 and then decreasing the number of beads inside is the only way to do it.I wished I hadn't started this medication in the first place.

I stopped the Cymbalta due to the cost! I love love love this med. I always have felt heavy with burden, or have had social anxiety, couldn't stand to talk to ANYONE if i wasn't interested in the conversation. I could agree with them all day long but not even remember what the conversation was about later! I had NO interest in anyones thoughts, ideas, or conversations, or life stories! I could only see the pos. effects from this med. when it finally regulated in my body, which was roughly a constinous month without missing a single dose! I became more engaged in conversations with people, was truly interested with what they had to say, and was able to comprehend what was being said to remember it later! I am more happy with life in general, i'm more laid back and just about accepting of whatever burdens or stress that heads my way! I do have VERY vivid dreams( almost life like), I STILL have NO SEXUAL DRIVE AT ALL! I DO NOT like that and neither does my husband! I AM NOT ABLE TO ORGASM, I HAVE GAINED ABOUT 15LB.S IN 6 MONTHS, i have less desire to get up and do the things i once loved (waxing my car, cutting grass, and MAINLY cleaning)! Its a toss-up for me on wether or not its worth taking the meds and dealing with the neg. side effects, or going back to being a selfish, inconsiderate individual that loved the outdoors!  I love the possitive sides and ABSOLUTLY HATE THE NEG. I hope this information has help a user that has some questions!

I tried Lexapro (did not like and did not seem to work), Paxil (worked but was too powerful with side effects), Remeron (did not seem to work and had little to no side effects), and Welbutrin (did not seem to work as well as Effexor ""for me""). One thing is for sure, all of these meds cause grief when missing a dose or trying to stop. Paxil was by far the worst if I missed a dose. I have always taken low dosages of these meds but they seem to even me out. Effexor does not cause side effects at 75mg but at 150mg I was having libo issues and it did not seem to help me in any way that was apparent or measureable. Effexor XR can be missed for about one day but come the second day I get headaches, the zaps and dizzy headed. Some of the other meds I tried could not be missed by one day without terrible withdrawl symptoms. I might try a Welbutrin/Effexor combo but it will be a minimal dose for both.

It was the worse side effects I have EVER experenced and ended up in the ER after one week of use. It caused severe night sweeats, sleep diisturbance, worsened the anxiety to the point of my brain being completely manic/aggitated and could not concentrate on the minor of things (TV!).  It was explained to me by a psych doctor, after the fact, that the reason I had this reaction is because the med is for anxiety AND depression. Since I did not suffer from depression it simply added 'gasoline to the fire' by speeding  up my brain - tenfold! I am now on Buspar (one week) and  have not experienced any side effects.

I was what my doctor called a state of hibernation.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I couldn't wake up in the morning, I'd nap at lunch and go to bed as soon as I got home from work.  I'm transitioning to Pristiq at this time so let's see how this goes but Effexor and Paxil have been the two meds that worked the best for me.

I have been taking the Effexor XR for almost 3 months after being on Cymbalta, and the generic for Effexor, due to the fact that Cymbalta didn't help me much and taking two doses of the generic effexor just about made me puke because of the taste. For the first couple weeks of taking it, i swore that it was a waste of time and most deffinatley money! I continued doctors orders and took my medicine on a regular basis! I am glad that i did because after my body regulated the drug i have seen a great difference. I am much more happier, content, and i don't loose my cool at the drop of a dime! I am able to focus 10 times better and i am able to socialize much easier than before! It has done wonders for me! I found that taking my med. before i go to sleep rather than early in the morning when i awoke made me feel better and help curve the appetites and cravings! This drug makes you pretty hungry and wanting to snack all the time. So by taking it before i go to sleep helped me bypass all the cravings and snacking! my dreams became more vivid or ""real life like"" but i would rather the dreams than the weight gain! The only down side to this medication that i have experienced so far is minor headaches, (including sinus), and only once since taking the med. i felt like snapping and being extremely pissed off, (most likely due to my body trying to regulate the drug), gaining weight, (I ABSOLUTLY hate it). I am retaining ALOT of fluid. I have an appointment Fri. so hopefully i will be able to get the water retention under wraps! I have not expierenced the brain ""zaps"", nausea, or any other negative side affects that many users talk about on the reviews of this drug! I hope that some of this information has helped other users, and or reviewers that are thinking about taking Effexor XR. Everyone is different when it comes to narcotics! "

1671$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/1/2009 9:01:10 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have always had the normal bouts with anxiety but around 6 months ago, while I was away on a conference trip, I began having anxiety attacks (excelerated heatbeat, feeling of something bad was going to happen if I drive over the bridge). Then when I got home, the anxiety got worse.  I felt like I was losing my mind, totally unlike myself. I decided I needed to see my doctor immediately because I knew something was not right.  He gave me Effexor-I started on 37.5 dose for 10 days, then increased to 75mg a day.  The first time I took it, I felt this overwhelming sensation of cool happiness and I knew it was going to help me.  My anxiety didn't completely go away but it has made a huge difference in how I felt during that time.  My doctor said he can increase the dosage but I didn't want to for fear of being overly medicated and too dependent on it.  Now that I have been on it for 6 months, I feel okay to increase it, if need be.  I am a little apprehensive of what type of withdrawal side effects I will feel, but I am confident in my doctor and will follow his instructions to decrease my dosage slowly.  I know everybody has their own experience with this medication, but I wanted to share mine in hope's that it will help someone feel okay about taking it.  I had not intended to write this review but I read the guy's experience who wrote on 5/30/09 @ 3:21pm and it touched me.  So I hope this will help someone. Also, turning to my faith, family, and friends has been a tremendous help.

Wow, that's no fun.  I will never say to someone, ""hey snap out of it"" Life works in funny ways sometimes.  Anyways, was forced to get help with the depression. Started with lowest dose 37.5 for 10 days, then 75mg for 14 days and to date at 75 + 37.5 = 112.5mg.  The hardest part was waiting for it to work, It took atleast 5/6 weeks. I wanted to quit many times, but stuck with it. Weird side effects along the way but help from Dr., Therapist and friends helped. The other problem was I expected when it did work to immediately make the depression just go away.  Found out ""it don't work that way"" I guess the depression came on slowly (thou I never realized) and it goes away slowly.  So I seemed to feel best in the evening and worst in the morning. Dr. said that's normal with depression. The other hurdle to get over is I'll be feeling like my old self for a day or two and ""boom"" out of the clear blue it creeps back.  Which at first really scared me and pissed me off.  How dare it, after all that hard work. But, with patience I slowly start feeling better again. Quite a roller coaster ride. To date, I have more better days than bad days. Having to work hard at feeling just ""normal"" does suck.  But life is worth it. With so many horrible things that can happen to us, I try to feel fortunate compared to those who have no real hope.  Regarding people with suicide thoughts, as long as you keep them as thoughts, just don't act on them.  I'm sure every adult has wondered about suicide at some point. Someone once told me that suicide is a ""Final solution to a Temporary problem"". Think about it very true.
Depression/Anx are the most treatable of mental disorders.  So hang in there, take baby steps, and believe in the BIG Guy.  That's all I'm doing. "

I have been off it for a week and I am constantly dizzy (even feel dizzy in my dreams) and often nauseous.  I am also really irritable and am trying to avoid my co-workers so I don't bite anyone's head off for no reason. When I'm not irritable I feel weepy and lately anxious and paranoid.  I have already started taking Wellbutrin and I think it is helping.  It is very frustrating that none of the literature talks about length of withdrawal symptoms.  I know it's different for everyone but surely someone has measured this in a test group and can publish the results from that group.  I haven't even been able to find a comment anywhere from someone saying they managed to get off it and are now finally feeling better.  Very disheartening.  Published tests of new drugs should include discontinuation symptoms and observed length of those symptoms. There is no good reason to exclude that data.

It helps me get through the day and helps me sleep better at night.  

I began taking Effexor 6 years ago, starting with the lowest dosage, currently I take the highest dosage.  

It must be taken daily for it to be effective, and be warned, do NOT stop taking it cold turkey.  Missing a pill causes vertigo (dizziness), nausea and fatigue.  

The drug does not mix well with alcohol.  If you do drink, be advised, you will 'hit the wall' rather quickly, and likely sprial into a depression episode.  

If taken correctly it is a miracle drug and I plan on taking it the rest of my life. It may not be for everyone, but it probably saved my life.

After going through a series of therapies for major depression, it was discovered that I had a major case of ADHD with anxiety and panic cohorts (at the age of 48!).  This diagnosis explained everything that was me.  I was referred to a PA (believe it or not!) who worked with Psych MD's and started me on Effexor.  It was almost an instant relief of my anxiety.  After two months, I was at 150mg per day.  Now, to get off ritalin without driving everyone mad.  Without ritalin, I am now on 300 mg per day, with 300 mg of Wellbutrin to boot!  Yes, I'm an extreme case, but it's disconcerting that most of the reviews are negative.

First, I was on several drugs for a while that didn't really work.  I agree that Effexor shouldn't be a first line of defense.  But if it works, why worry about the withdrawals?  I don't ever want to stop taking Effexor.  My wife and kids can approach me 24/7 even with bad news.  I have no stress except eustress.  I can keep my cool, ignore messy people, gossip, and know it alls!

One other thing - why is Effexor not advertised (by the doctors) more for treatment of moderate to severe AD/HD?

I have nothing but high praise for Effexor.  It saved my marriage, my family, my work, among other things."

I would not say my depression has lifted 100%, which is a rare case, but probably about 80%, which gets me through most days. It was prescribed about 5-6 yrs ago by my PCP, when I saw him for the first time. I had been on Lexapro, Celexa and Paxil previously, (not at the same time), but with each of those meds, after taking them for about 6 months to a year, I began to have very very vivid dreams, not exactly nightmares, but vivid enough to really disturb my sleep and not allow me to function well the next day. This HAS NOT happened with EFFEXOR XR 150mg, even after all this time. 
Also, about 2 yrs ago I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia,and we tried taking me off Effexor a few months ago and going on Cymbalta, to kill two birds with 1 stone, so to speak, but I had a horrible reaction to the Cymbalta (the Fibro actually got much worse) and I went back to Effexor. This seems to be the best antidepressant for me with the fewest side effects, maybe dry mouth, and some sleepiness, nothing major. Unless I miss a dose. DO NOT MISS A DOSE! If you wish to reduce your dosage or get off the drug altogether, do not do so without a dr's advise, otherwise you will feel like a truck hit you.
My conclusion, for me: it works, and I will continue to use it.     "

I started this medication after being severely depressed.  It was a great drug while I was on it.  I didnt cry all the time, or anything like that.  In fact, I was quite numb to everything around me.  But after 3 years or so of being on it, I was going to lose my insurance, and Effexor is way too expensive, so I decided to get off of it.  And let me tell you, that was the worst decision I have ever made.  The withdrawal effects were so severe.  I ended up checking into a psychiatric ward.  I had brain zaps, nausea, constant crying.  In fact, it is a year after I stopped taking this medication, and I still have severe nausea.  This medication was good while I was on it.  So basically, if you are prescribed this medication, plan on being on it for the rest of your life.

I would not recommend this to anyone.."

It worked almost immediately for about 1 year and then the hot flashes came back but not as severe.  My doctor wanted to increase my dose but I opted not to.  Thank goodness I made this decision.  I have been trying to wean myself off this drug for 2 months very gradually.  Every change came with symptoms.  I am now down to 37.5; on one day; off two.  Everytime I try to go to off 3 days I feel like I have the flu and worse is the fact that my brain is disfunctional.  I am dizzy, confused and cannot concentrate.  This in addition to nausea and fatigue.  I want off this drug so badly because it eventually made me feel ""nothing"".  I went to a funeral of a very good friend and felt nothing.  I have not cried in over a year even though I want too.  I am miserable and I am going to try just not taking it again.  It should be offered in a lower dose for weaning off purposes.  If I knew that I would have to go through this, I would have put up with the hot flashes instead!  These symptoms are so severe, I don't feel like I should drive or work.  I am also irritable and my family is finding me difficult to live with.  The doctor who prescribed to me is a GYN and I don't think she had knowledge of these horrific side effects either.

I had headaches 5-7 times a week but thought that was just me - I've had headaches for years.  I was fatigued but thought I just had no will power to exercise, and improve my fitness.   I would only sleep about 5 hours a night, I had no energy.   I was slower in everything I did eg, speech, typing, decision making domestic chores.     During the Dr-scheduled withdrawal I had headaches, diarrhea, shakes and felt dreadful - I was sent home from work twice. 

AFTER withdrawing  the facial sweating and headaches STOPPED;  I had increased libido and upswings in moods.  My speed of speech, processing, decision making and implementation increased significantly (I work in an environment where constant statistics are taken throughout every shift.  I have gone from 'Performance Management"" - ie, your performance is below standard and your job is at risk - to beating targets in an incredibly short period of time - since withdrawing from the Effexor¬).

The downside is that after a honeymoon period of about 10-12 days my anxiety increased so much that today I have been put on another medication  (Lexapro) to control it.  I'M HOPING my body will better tolerate it  however I will know better what to look for instead of assuming these problems are all personal attributes uninfluenced by medication side effects as everyone of them improved since coming off the Effexor.  
SUMMARY:
The Effexor definitely controlled depression and anxiety (though from time to time I still felt both) but the cost in side effects was VERY high and if the facial sweating had not started YEARS after taking the medication, indicating I was experiencing a side effect, I would still be taking Effexor & suffering all of the side effects, whic"

It doesn't interfere with sexual activity (as it does for some). I can, but prefer not to drive for @ 2 hours after dosing.

I began effexor to treat migraines. I suffered from many of the common side effects moodiness, constipation, inability to become sexually aroused, dehydration, and weight gain. The worst part about the drug is that it is next to impossible to get off of. But I DID IT!!! You need to start by weening yourself down to the lowest dose (37.5mg). Once there take the capsule pills only. Open the capsule and each day take out 5 of the small round balls. If you feel so sick from the removal stay at that level until you feel ok. Example remove 10 for three days instead of moving on to 15 if you are feeling sick. Keep doing this until you get down to 0. It took over three months but I am finally off this dreaded medication after 3 years. It is not easy but just after a month of not being on it i feel amazing and my sex life has already changed and i am having more frequent bowel movements. This is the ONLY way to get off it. Trust me i have tried cold turkey and the skipping tablets it does NOT work. Good luck and please get off of this medication and on to something else ASAP. I hope this helps :)

I have also taken the new Pristiq, it helps but less for GAD.(even though they are basically the same thing-and metabolize differently. The best way to get off the effexor xr is reduce your dose to 37.5 and take 5mg or 10mg prozac. After 1 week discontinue the effexor and continue to take the prozac for 3 to 4 weeks. This should help minimize the withdrawls, everyone is different so you can tweek it to your needs. I have done this many times... anyway this is food for thought for people that are having problems getting off of it!!I hope it helps!

However, after 4 years of using this medication, I am now trying to come off of it and experiencing withdrawal symptoms that are beyond anything I would have imagined.  The ""brain zaps"" are the worst.  I will accept the fever, muscle pain, restless legs (which include muscle spasms), fatigue, nightmares, vertigo, crying spells and irrational outbursts - but - something that is truly best described as brain zaps - no, that I will not accept.  It is absolutely terrible that this drug is allowed on the market.  There has to be something else out there to treat depression, axiety and panic disorder that does not require such severe withdrawal symptoms.  I feel like a heroin addict or something... ridiculous!  It has been 6 days so far and everything that I have read says that I am no where near out of the woods.  I just pray that this feeling in my brain - that really feels like my brain has been pressed against an electric fence - will subside.  I have now missed days at work due to these symptoms.  I really hope that people consider the withdrawals before taking their doctors word at this drug.  There HAS to be something else."

Although the side effects were rough, I had to admit that there were periods of ""calm"" that made me think if this is how I was going to feel when I was used to the medication, then this IS worth it.

I've been on the medication for about 4 months now and it's been pretty good so far. I no longer have panic attacks and surprisingly rarely get nervous before giving presentations at work (something I could barely do before). One of the only things that I don't like is that I seem a bit ""numb"" and have become more forgetful. I sometimes have a hard time concentrating, too. I've read about the symptoms of withdrawal, which alone would make me stay on this drug...especially if it was like the side effects I had when I started it. 

My family says that I seem more happy and less anxious. I've had no problems facing situations that used to make me feel uncomfortable, which is a huge plus. I'm able to go to the theater, be in large crowds, and my ""nervous stomach"" seems to have disappeared! My next test is a plane trip we're taking late in May. If I can get through that trip without incident, then I feel almost ""cured."" Overall, I'm glad I gave it a chance and wish I would have done this years ago. "

Weight loss and significant weight loss are side effects. If you are gaining weight my guess is you already were overweight and/or you are on a different mediciation that doesn't mix well. Unless they have fixed ingredients since everyone has used it. I had severe mood swings and anxiety before.

I was to go 2 weeks lower does of effexor and then 4 days later add the celexa. Well rollercoaster ride I was on the first three days of lowering the dose to 75mg I was wired with energy you wouldnt believe then slowly felt better with the celexa it took a little bit for me to get used to the medication switch and so forth. Well now its been two weeks off of the effexor and its a very hard drug to get off so just be careful. I have felt very dizzy, lightheadedness at times throughout the day. It feels as though you have had nothing to eat and your sugar is dropping even if you have eaten already. That shakey tingly feeling. You will have it in spurts for a few days, you might get panic attacks if you have had trouble with them in the past. They dont last long but they last for only about 10 minutes or so. I hope this was helpful for any of you getting off of it.

I was on the highest legal dosage at the time (I don't know if it's changed since then) and would get horrid nightmares if I forgot to take it, and it made me sleepy all the time.  Since going off, I can't remember a lot of what happened that year I was on it, and I developed intense sensitivity in my two front teeth, particularly troublesome as a clarinetist.  I discovered after a visit to an endodontist that they sometimes use this to block nerves to the teeth.  Had I been aware of this possible side effect, I never would have taken it.  My career as a clarinetist ended at 19 because the drug was too new and doctors didn't know it could do this to me.  I never wanted to go on anti-depressants in the first place, and I'm not happy I was on this.

The side effects have been some tinnitus (ringing in ears), undoubteldy due to elevated blood pressure, but not extreme.  Also lower libido but at my age I don't care.   I have not experienced signficant weight gain.  It is livable.  This drug as allowed me to function in a high stress workplace effectively.

I've been on so many antidepressants that I can't recall all the names. My first drug was Elivil; the night I took it was the first night I had slept 8 hours in years. For one reason or another, I tried and stopped using many other drugs. I was suicidal and homocidal on Prozac after 3 months of ""heaven,"" had horrible shakes and anxiety on Zoloft, no effect with Paxil and others. Finally, was put on Effexor and it worked to keep me alive. My rages began escalating about two years ago and my psychiatrist added buspirone. I am now ""in control"" but like others here, I gained 40 pounds, have no sex drive, sweat heavily (especially from the head), don't have much energy, have problems with memory, and my body lets me know when I forget to take my pills (dizzy, unbalanced). I may have severe withdrawals if I quit the drug, but I think I'll probably be on them for the rest of my life, so I'm not going to worry about.  In the long run, I would much rather have the side effects than feel like I'm in Hell day in and day out; have nightmares; wish (pray)for death; live alone because I can't get along with anyone; be a threat to anyone who tips my rage scale over the edge. It was a long road and many years (1995 from diagnosis to 2004) before my phyciatrists and I found the right antidepressant and the right dosage. Don't give up trying!"

The withdrawal period was the worst time in my entire life. The best way to get off it, if you are looking, is to reduce the dose VERY SLOWLY. Talk to your doctor, and come up with a plan to reduce dosage. I have read on other sites that people just stopped after 75mg, but that is what I was on initially. I had to cut it in half every week over the course of several weeks. I would advise taking a different drug as this is seriously not worth the pain of getting off it.

Anyway I am still trying to get off them. I have been on about 17.5 mg for 8 months now. For about 5 months I have been only taking the 1/4 tablet every few days, just when I start getting the withdrawl symptoms. The symptoms are awful. I have tried and waited about 24-30 hours after symptoms start to see if they might go away but in that amount of time they never have and I end up taken the med. I had been told when I started them that I would just tapper off over a few weeks. Wow,years later. When I had told my Doctor about all the anxiety and other withdrawl symptoms he said I was just going to have to stay on them.....forever.that was not ok with me. Anyway just know I think I have read a few blogs from people at another site that had no problems getting off. Most were like me though so if you are reading up on theis drug before you take it you have been warned it is not fun at all getting off this.If you think how bad could it be, well if you think you are depressed now plus worse things and feelings. good luck

This situation is becoming unbearable and it is like that with every anti-depressant I have tried in this group does the same thing.  I am also on doxepin and remeron, they do not cause this.  I quit taking Effexor for 3 months and the hot spells completely stopped.  But then I was crying all the time and the depression had really set in.  I saw no purpose for anything.  I obviously was born with clinical depression.  The doxepin 50 mg. and the remeron 30 mg. did not seem to help, except with sleep. So, I started back on the Effexor 150mg. and in a few weeks all was fine, except the hot spells.  I am not getting enough exersize because of this and I am a very active person, or was. Please help, no one seems to know what is in the drugs that causes this.  I have tried, I suppose all of the new generation drugs and have this response to all, yet the others don't work. HELP

After a month with no change, the Dr increased it to the maximum manufacturer's dosage (I was 95 lbs).  The depression lifted like magic and I felt alive again. The Dr insisted I remain on this med at this high dose and after 2 1/2 yrs my weight gain of 50 lbs...!!! became a depression in itself, had drawers and a closet full of clothes I couldn't fit into anymore. I was horrified. This med made me CRAVE food and especially sweets..and I'm not by nature a sweet eater.  I changed Drs in July 2000 and he was surprised at the large dose I was on, took me off of it completely.  My experience was that it worked, it had several side effects as they all do, but the huge dose for the extended time was detrimental in the long run.

I feel great overall.  I am a full time working mom of 3 and working on my master's degree.  I feel great. No more panic attacks. No more aches and pains or worries.  I am worried about coming off the meds when the time is right, but feel great. This is my first time taking any meds for this.  The most of anything I've taken is an antibiotic. It's great. I keep in contact with my doc with check ups, and the current lowest dose works for me.  It was difficult for me to admit I was having anxiety and panic attacks. good luck to all
1788$Condition: Depression$4/2/2009 6:58:18 PM$Reviewer: mistala, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"At first WebMD REALLY freaked me out; reading all of the ""avoid this medicine"" reviews from users.  There were many stories from people that scared me.  I told my Dr. about them and of course he said, ""yeah, there are many skeptics out there ESPECIALLY on the web.""  Well, he was right.
The drug has been very effective.  I gradually built up to 150mg.  In the past I've taken lexapro (effective also, but gained weight) and wellbutrin (totally ineffective, lost weight).  This drug is a very happy medium. It's effective and I haven't gained weight.  I'm extremely satisfied with the results.  I feel a lot more stable, my anxiety has gone WAY WAY down, and overall I am really back to being myself. I started feeling the effects of it about 3 weeks into taking it.  
My purpose of writing is really to say - everyone has their own experience with these drugs.  You may need to try a few.  The most important thing is to, when coming off, speak with your doctor and do it slowly - you should have a problem, really."

My Dr took me off SLOWLY changing the dose every two weeks (2wks at 150/75 alt days, 2 wks at 75/day, 2 wks at 75/37.5 alt days, 2wks at 37.5/day, 2 wks at 37.5/nothing alt days, then off) I have now been Effexor freevfor one full week and I am still suffering from withdrawl symptoms that seem to be getting worse by the day.  I didn't have a problem with the withdrawl symptoms while transitioning until now.  I'm dizzy, my brain feels like its swimming, and my sleep schedule just depends on the day  (sometimes I can sleep sometimes I can't).  Being a nurse I realize that taking medication that alter mood and all that will have withdrawl symptoms but I NEVER realized that anything could be this bad.  The medication worked and served its purpose (without side effects) while taking it but I suggest talking to your doctor about what happens down the road when you try to get off.  Unfortunatley you never know how your body will react until that time comes but maybe there are other medications out there that are easier to transition off of without feeling like a zombie!  Hope this helps!

I was having unwanted thoughts and fears that I knew didn't make any sense. I was so anxious to the point where I could no longer take it. So I decided to seek advice from a PA and he prescribed me Effexor XR 35mg. At first I did other things to try to avoid medication, such as herbal supplements, but those didn’t last all day. One day I was so sad that I decided to go ahead and take the medication. What do I have to lose... This is only my faith day and I really do notice a difference. I no longer feel depressed or worried about things that don't make sense and I finally feel like myself again.

Decided to get off the medication because I could no longer take the side effects when I missed a dose. Even though the doctor brought me down slow the withdrawals were still not good. It has now been 2 1/2 weeks since I have been off, things are better but I am still having the withdrawal symptoms. Even though this medication can help; make sure that the pros out way the cons, other wise try to find something else that gives the same relief.

I recommend doctors to go straight to this medication.  I also recommend getting th patient off sleep-aids if they are on them, asap! The reason is sandoz-buproprion or trazadone or panaxil etc. tends to be the culprit for the bad side-effects.  The patient needs to sleep, but might feel miserable and totally ineffective on them. As soon as they can sleep four hours or more regularly on their own, they need to get off the sleep-aids so they can see the effects of Effexor -XR working faster.  I have taken up to 262.5mg for over a year. There is not any problem with a higher suggested does as long as the patient is monitored every week in the increase phases. Even two times a week if they are a high risk patient.  Effexor is freedom that I haven't felt in years and I would not be here without it.  If you need it, take it!  If you had a malignant tumor, remove it! Same thing. Get proactive, take care of your depression, and get on with a normal happy life! Good Luck to you in your journey.

It works well while you are on it, but if you miss a dose it is aweful!  I have been on this medicine for six years and I don't recommend it to anyone that can find another drug that works.  As soon as I miss a dose I get light headed and feel like I am going to pass out.  Then I develop flu-like symptoms.  I get body aches, fever, chills, and cannot move.  It is absolutely horrible. I have spoken with a few people about it and I might have to go to an actual detox facility if I want to get off of it all together. I have had issues with my insurance not wanting to cover this medicine and it has been a hassle since I started taking it.  If it didn't treat my depression at the same time I would not take it.  Definitely be causious is your doctor recommends it or if you are thinking about taking it.

1854$Condition: Depression$3/12/2009 8:39:12 AM$Reviewer: Alive and Well, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on 300 mgs for 4-5 years plus 100mg of Wellbutrin (counters the effect of low labido and inability to acheive orgasm). At this higher dose it is also effective for treating anxiety and OCD. Once the initial side effects have been resolved, which I found to be quite tolerable, the drug works well. It is very important to take this drug as directed. Missing a dose has unpleasant side effects. Missing 2 or more doses causes extreme negative side effects that are physically and mentally noticable. The key here is follow your Dr's direction for taking this drug to the letter and never self reduce without his/her approval. The drug is highly effective when taken as directed.

If I accidentally missed a dose, the side effects were awful!!  I am now in my third week of weening off of this medication and it has been a terrible experience.  Nausea, dizziness, incredible tiredness, massive emotional roller coaster, terrifying dreams, etc... there are days I feel so sick I can't get out of bed.  I am glad Effexor works for some but don't feel the physical side effects are worth it for me.  I would recommend EXTREME CAUTION to anyone considering this med as an option.  I stayed on a relatively low dose (75mg), as well and still had this many problems with it.
1862$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/10/2009 10:02:09 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$4$3$"I took a small dose (75mg) of Effexor, but for only a month. I heard a lot of bad things about it, but decided to go ahead and try it. The beginning was hard because of the side effects, (couldn't sleep, felt sick to my stomach, jaw clinching) I started out at 37.5mg, but after about 7-10 days moved to 75mg. As soon as I started the 75mg dose, I lost complete desire for sex and could not have an orgasm. That was it for me. I then decided to ween myself off of it. Again, read many bad things about going off the drug. I fortunately didn't have too many problems. I decreased my dose to 37.5 mg for a week from the 75 and experienced a little clinching of the jaw and maybe a little light-headedness. I'm now 4 days off completely. The only thing I notice is I'm having trouble sleeping at night. I am sure this will wear off soon. The good thing, my sexual desire is back. So overall the dug may have been fine if it didn't have the sexual side effect, and the weening off was fine as well. I may not have had any problems because I was on a low dose and only on the drug for a month. It's worth a try if you are wondering if it'll work for you. But if it doesn't, then I recommend going off of it sooner than later. 

PS. I read to take Fish Oil supplements and Super B complex while weening off, which I did. 

Hope this helps....

This drug, if it's not taken at a specific time every day, can send you into a violent manic tailspin, and no matter how much you know what you're doing is crazy, you can't stop it. If you have a sleep disorder, and cannot be sure of the exact time you take your meds, this drug is a death wish. It nearly cost me a husband, and my son, because this drug didn't help with my depression, and trying to come off of 300mg is a long process, and a dangerous one. I was suicidal, more so than ever, on this drug, and when I spoke to other members of my family, and friends, that took effexor xr, no one had anything good to say, whether they took 37.5 mg, or 300mg. Coming off XR, I had to lock myself in my bedroom, and pray that I wouldn't flip out because I was seriously scared of myself, and couldn't control my mood swings. This drug has done more harm than good in everyone that I've talked to.  DANGEROUS

All of this I dealt with for the 1 1/2 years that I was on Effexor, but I feel compelled to tell my story of trying to ease off of the drug. I found the experience terrifying. I became instantly sad and angry. I also had ""brain zaps"" as I called them for several weeks. I could feel electrical shocks in my brain and legs and feet. I also had this strange sensation of being able to hear very loudly and feel my eyes moving. It all sounds silly, but was very scarey at the time. I started doing some research online, and found countless similar testimonials. Some people claimed that these 'Zaps' never went away. I was NEVER warned about any of this, and feel very betrayed by both my doctor and the drug industry. I suggest to anyone starting this med to be prepared. "

Be sure and really quiz your doctor about all the medications and ask him or her why they feel a particular anti depressant is the one that they want to get you started on.

Honestly I'd rather be overweight than deal with the anxiety attacks I had, but still it does stuck.  Also, at one time I thought I was cured and tried to get of the medicine.  I thought I would die!  I did exactly as the doctor told me and slowly weaned myself; but the nausea and headaches were too much to bear.  I decided I'd rather be on it and fat; then go through the pain.  I've found sites on the internet that have better plans for getting off of it than my doctor's, but I still don't think it is worth it.

1936$Condition: Other$2/18/2009 2:23:15 PM$Reviewer: whitefeatherliz, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$I was placed on Effexor XR for Fibromyalgia and associated issues in Sept 2008. I started with 37.5 mg and worked my way to 75mg by Nov 2008. For the most part this medication worked for the pain and anxiety issues that come with Fibro... though the side effects were somewhat bothersome; hot flashes and sweating, my blood preasure became elevated requiring another med to lower it, I felt more tired than I did without the medication, and lacked motivation to do much of anything. I experienced dry mouth, dizzyness and stomach upset for the first several months then these subsided. I found this medication also caused me to become winded very easily, caused heart palpitations and muscle weakness when trying to walk any distance that would be part of everyday activities such as grocery shopping. I admit I do feel this med helped with mood and anxiety levels, since I have had to deal with serious family issues (my daughter was raped, and has been suicidal since the attack). I was able to calmly handle every aspect of the incident with great calm and focus. My reason for coming off the medication is because I am currently participating in a drug research program for Milnasipran so I had to detox off the effexor before starting the program / research. The worst part about the effexor was the coming off phase. The withdrawl from this medication was horiffic! My doctor advised me that because I was on a low dosage for a short period of time I could go cold turkey when coming off the med. I experienced terrible headaches, and zaps (the only way I can explain the effects my brain felt if I would move my head or eyes) this lasted for about 2 wks, I also was very ill; nausiated, diahrea, terrible body tremors, cold chills, and mood swings. All of these detox withdrawl symptoms I was advised can be normal. My brain (the zaps and headaches) was reacting to not having the chemicals that effexor balances out. Overall I believe this med works but I would not go back on it if I had to.

1942$Condition: Depression$2/17/2009 12:56:14 PM$Reviewer: ANGELA,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$1$4$In the short term, Effexor XR was very effective in treating my depression and anxiety.  However, after being on this med for 8 months, I gained 35-40 lbs! The weight gain was not immediate, it just sneaks up on you.  There was abolutely no weight gain for the first 3 months or so, but then I noticed gaining a few pounds here and there and my clothes became tighter.  Even though I had not changed my eating habits at all, I was gaining weight!  I went from a size 8 to a size 12.  At that point, Effexor became counter-productive for me since the weight gain really depressed me.  I went off of it last week (cold turkey) and I've lost 4 lbs.  Luckily, I've had no withdrawal symptoms (even though you are not supposed to go cold turkey).  In summary, I guess for the short term (3 months or less), Effexor XR is great, but I would never EVER take it longer than that due to the weight gain.

I have spent yr.s with fear of meds., anxiety attacks, bipolar, social issues and so much more! I been thru several dr.s who couldn't find a way to treat me. I am now taking this med. everyday, sleeping at night and ready to start the day in the morn. with a smile. I have never felt better. I hope this is something that I can take the rest of my life! I have noticed feeling of pulsating in my head and some blurried vision. I just have found so many great reason to take it then reasons not to, like remember things from day to day, I finally have patients for the little things and I am so much more organized. Finally a medicaton made for all my disorders in one, and finally the end of all those stressful test! Without trying this med. I don't think they'd ever figured out how to give me my life back, my kids a better mom, or my husband a wife that wanted to live another day.

The Effexor got me out of a hell hole. But for the last year, I have been experiencing advancing blurriness, aggitation and finally jaundice. Because of my moods going up and down, I thought and also my psychiatrist thought that I was bipolar so he put me on Lamictal.I couldn't tolerate this med. because it caused severe joint pain. I had blood work checked last March and the results were all normal except for my cholesterol and triglycerides were  elevated. These are side effects of Effexor XR. I wish I had read all this information when all the symptoms started happening to my body. I should have gone on the computer and read all the side effects instead of being naive. I questioned my psychiatrist and he thought that I was rationalizing too much between an elevated blood pressure and an increase with my aggitation. (Jee, I am not bipolar after all). I guess I was right and he was definately wrong. Even though we have ""mental issues"", we should take all the changes in our behavior seriously after we are put on these medications. Our chemical imbalances lead us to take these chemicals. I have been off the med for almost 2 weeks after cutting myself down (I work in a doctor's office) and the main withdrawal was dizziness and I had to really concentrate on what I was saying. I feel great right now, no depression or anxiety. I hope and pray I remain this way and I hope that everyone pays attention to each and every day while on this med. Keep a diary. "

I had to stop taking it once I realized it was causing my violent dreams.  The very real problem with the violent dreams is that I was acting them out in my sleep.  This resulted in my hitting and kicking my wife in bed, and then throwing myself out of my bed resulting in back surgery after one episode, and neck rehab after another.  The dream side effects can be very dangerous!  I have tried several other antidepressants, resulting in other side effects, none have included the violent dreams.  Anafril still involved acting out my dreams, but they were not nearly as violent.  Luvox does not seem to control the anger, so I am trying Lexapro next.

I hope my input will help someone who is suffering from Panic Disorder which can be debilitating when gone untreated. I’ve been on Effexor for about a year and this drug has been a God send for me. I am able to manage my life. If it were not for this medication I would not be able to enjoy life not be able to hold down the management position I have; never mind be able to function in the day-to-day world. I’ve tried Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac which are also good medications however each person is different as each medication is as well. As far as side affects – if you miss a day you may experience what called “brain shivers”. Not a good feeling at all however goes away after you get back on schedule. To suffer and do nothing feels much worse then any side affect you may experience. I would strongly suggest not stop Effoxor cold turkey. As with all antidepressants, patients will need to be weaned off. Regardless, Effexor works well and is well tolerated. Hope this helps.

It was the only thing that helped me to get off of it and not suffer the extreme withdrawal symptoms. It took me about 3 weeks to ween off. I am back on it again, though. It seems to work. Same as many others- very bizarre dreams! Can be very funny. No nightmares, though. Sometimes, lack of energy. Definitely lack of desire, but not lack of ability to have sex. I have noticed memory issues, but not sure it's related to this drug or Ambien.

I recently began taking the generic Effexor when the Celexa seemed to stop working. There were a lot of side effects initially which eventually went away and the antidepressant seemed to be working. I've recently been having problems with exessive fatigue ( after a full nights sleep, I can still sleep all day and have fallen asleep mid sentence sitting on the couch!)I've begun to suspect the Effexor may be the cause of this because I see no other reason for this constant tiredness and have not had this problem before. However, I had no idea that the withdrawls lasted so long so I am afraid to discontinue use. I am the only person at home with my three young children and I have an idea what I am in for because I have forgotten a dose before and the dizziness and heart palpitations were awful and appeared very randomly. I wouldn't recommend this medication if you have any other choices.

First I tried Zoloft, which made me feel horrible and I would literally wake up in the middle of the night having panic attacks.  After starting Effexor XR (give it a chance for your body to adjust to the medication, about a month) I have not had a major panic attack in years!  NOT ONE.  Started on 37.5 mg for a few weeks, then moved up to 75, the to 150, and took 225 mg for a few years.  You will have decreased energy, increased sweating, and lucid dreams.  All of these went away for me after using it for a few months.  When my dose was being increased, the symptoms would return for a week or so.  Not for high BP patients.

Wean slowly...slower than you think.  I've been weaning for months now and have had great success.  DO NOT CUT YOUR DOSES IN HALF when trying to get off the med.  Instead, go down by 37.5 mg each month or so.  Seems conservative, but the side effects aren't as severe.  

Unfortunately, this med is outrageously expensive.  I was paying as much as $240 a month at one point (with excellent insurance).  No generic!  When I missed a dose, I also paid the price.  Your head feels very ""swimmy"".  Light and sound was almost unbearable.  Take it in the morning with a light breakfast to curb insomnia in the evening.  

Effexor XR has honestly changed my life.  I can leave my house, drive, be a good mom, and maintain healthy relationships again.  Hang in there!             "

Effexor has helped with anxiety attacks and mood swings, but the side effects are unbearable, and are 10 times worse if I don't take it at the EXACT same time everyday. Horrible nightmares, chronic constipation, dizziness, headaches and TOTAL loss of sex drive. If you are considering this drug, PLEASE think twice and talk to your doctor about other treatment options. I hope to ween myself off soon, but I'll need lots of help, this is a VERY powerful drug.

This has been the only medication that has worked for all of my symptoms. I couldn't believe how well it worked in the beginning. My concentration was amazing. I didn't even know that it was possible to feel like that. I had tried Zoloft, Cymbalta, Aderall and many others that I don't even remember. I feel like I've tried everything. I do have to say that there are terrible withdrawal symptoms when you go off of it. I went off of it cold turkey off of 150mg when I was trying to get pregnant. Now that I have been on it for 2 years straight I am scared of going through the withdrawal again but I have started noticing a resistance to it.

I have taken Cymbalta and Buspar and neither of them have worked as well as this.  I think everyone is different and you should listen to your dr. when he/she prescribes something.  Maybe this isn't right for everyone.  I take 37.5 mg a day.  My dr. said that I could easily go to 75 mg a day, since that is the usual dose but I feel like this works for me.  At least for now.  I still have minor anxiety but nothing like I had before.  I have missed a dose now and then and when I do my biggest complaint is nightmares.  I realize when I decide to stop taking Effexor that I will experience awful side effects, but I think all medications have this.  When I went off of Cymbalta (took it for 6 months) I had brain zaps, dizziness, and other terrible symptoms that took a few months to get through.  But I did get through it.  This works for me now and I will continue to use it as long as I feel the need.  If your dr. recommends it, try it to see if it right for you.

For the first 2 years or so, it helped. I was able to leave the house and do the things I used to do with ease. Then things started to change. 

Now I constantly have nausea, insomnia, tremors, brain zaps, vertigo (dizziness) and mood swings. I take it every other day, and I still have the same result. It has effected my job, I have more panic attacks, I am slowly starting to not be able to leave the house, and I seem to be more irritable after its been in my system. After I take it, I am miserable the whole day. I can't eat, sleep, function, I feel like a zombie.

When I don't take it, I have severe brain zaps, I cry if someone looks at me cross-eyed, I become more violent, and I can't leave the house. Even going to the grocery store makes it worse.

I've tried a wide range of medicine to help relieve some of these symptoms, and so far nothing has worked: Celexa, Paxil, Depakote, Wellbutrin, Gapabentin, Neurontin, Topamax, Klonopin, Seroquel.

Mind you, I was around 17-18 during the time that I was taking all these, so it could have been my age, and maybe the fact that I had raging hormones and ""nothing worked"". 

I don't have health insurance, so it's been quite hard for me to change medications, so I've stuck to this medication. Why? I have no idea. All I do know is that I need to get on something different. It doesn't seem to help me anymore, only make things worse. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. It would really help me out a lot. I just want my life back."

I have been on it for 12 years. I've tried to self wean myself off of it but can't.  The original prescribing doctor left the state six months after putting me on it but said it would only take a year for me to stablize emotionally and be taken off of it. Since going on it I have been diagnosed with Disassociative Personality Disorder; I have also become an alcoholic. When I told my doctor how much I drank, he told me I really shouldn't do that any more. I am suicidal but benefit from the personality disorder since part of me remains the caretaker of human beings and animals and birds that I have been for my whole life. My brother shot his rifle at me because I had refused to let him molest me at less than 9 years of age, my father both sexually assualted and abused me at an early age and also told me that I should have been killed as a defective being; my mother told me from an early age that as the second born twin I would have been killed at birth had I been born in Africa. (note: I'm not African). I thought Effexor RX would help me get through a difficult stage as a government whistle blower. Instead I am addicted to it and lorazapan and alcohol. If I didn't have the ability and opportunity to care for beings and creatures less fortunate, I would have left this world.  No, I don't think any medicene that requires taking it for 12 years and with no end in sight is good. Treating a symptom does not treat the person or the cause.  And anyone on these meds should realize that most medical studies only look at the complications of usage for 6 months or less. The analytical side of me tells me that there is something very wrong in an advanced society that perpetuates drug usage rather than helping individuals to overcome emotional trauma.

Well they put me on 150 mgs at 17 years old and i definitly noticed a difference, but it wasnt a good one. I felt like the drug made me severely depressed and i would have night sweats and couldnt sleep. I became a person i didnt know anymore, but my mom made me take the pills. I was on them for almost 2 years and then i got pregnant and stopped immediately. Now im not on any meds and i've never been happier in my life.

It has lessened my appetite and in 2 weeks I have lost 4 pounds. I find I need to supplement with Seroquel to keep my mania in check. I have had one episode of severe shakiness and my blood pressure rose as did my pulse rate. My blood pressure returned to normal, but my heart rate stayed elevated all day--87, as opposed to 68. I am only on 75 mgs a day. I like Effexor, but I do have to worry about this manic feeling I have all the time. It's not good for me to feel this way. Seroquel works, but it makes me gain weight. I don't want to have to take both consistently. Anyone else have feelings of mania with Effexor XR?

I suffered for over 50 yrs with panic dissorder, anxiety and depression.  I never had a normal life since 5 yrs old. Now I can do anything and go anywhere.  I had tried 6 or 7 others with poor results.  I will probably be on this for life and I don't care.  Before Effexor Xr - must be XR - I had no life and shook in my shoes.  My problem is the price; as a Senior I hope to get some better pricing - I hope.

I became depressed early in High School when I underwent extensive back surgery and my parents got a divorce. These two events happened simultaneously, and my father falsely blamed me for the divorce. This led to my severe depression and self-hatred. I convinced my father to let me talk to my General Practitioner about depression, because he doesn't believe in ""Shrinks."" After trying many other antidepressants (Prozac, Lexapro, Elavil, and others), my GP decided to start me on Effexor. I was 15 years old at the time. I was not made aware of the drug's short half-life, nor was I told of the extreme dependence I would develop. I have been taking a very high dose (300mg daily) since I began the drug, and I absolutely hate it. As far as my depression symptoms go, this drug has been very effective in controlling them. However, if I miss just one dose, I suffer extreme ""brain shocks,"" dizziness, chills, shaking, and other withdrawal symptoms. I have talked with my GP about stopping this drug, but she will not assist me with it, because she believes I need to take it at least until I graduate from college. I am currently searching for a Psychiatrist who will understand this drug more thoroughly and who will help me break my addiction. I do not want to live my life dependent on a drug, and I wish I had never begun taking Effexor. Please consider VERY carefully the side effects and the dependence-causing qualities of this drug before you agree to take it. Also, be sure your doctor fully understands your condition. If you are suffering from a mental illness, speak to a Psychiatrist or Mental Therapist, not just your Family Doctor or General Practitioner. This medication is highly habit-forming. Please beware."

My experience with Effexor has been the worst. I had been taking 150mg for about 3 months and felt better. The depression ""broke through"" again and my doc increased the dose to 300mg. I began to experience terrible side-effects: headaches, irritability and even though I do not drink alcohol I felt hung-over every morning. Called the doctor and started cutting back the dosage over a few weeks. Now that I am not taking the drug at all I am miserable. I cannot sleep at night, I feel anxious, I'm experiencing what others have described as ""brain shivers"" and I just feel like my brain is not working properly. I'm having a lot of short-term memory problems too. It's the worst withdrawal I've ever experienced. 

I wish I had learned more about this drug before I began taking it. Any benefit I had during the first 3 months do not outweigh the side-effects and horrible withdrawal. This is a drug of last resort. Use with caution."

My experience was that it was not very effective for treating the symptoms of depression, and once I made the decision with my doctor to discontinue use, the side effects of withdrawal were absolutely unbearable. It took almost a year to come off the drug with very small reductions in dosage because any larger reductions caused me to not be able to function properly. Even going from the smallest available dose (37.5 mg) to nothing was almost impossible - I had to break the capsules apart and count out the little pellets inside to make smaller reductions in dose. The doctor's suggestion to take 37.5 mg every other day was not helpful - it just meant that the ""day off"" was terrible. Please, please consider the severe side effects of this drug before using it. It may be able to help you, but if it doesn't, you will pay a very high price for taking it."

I think if the doctors would take this pill for 1 month and get off of the pill they would not recommend this pill for nobody! This pill is the most physical addicting pill I have ever been on and highly recommend that no one to take this pill. It made me have sucidial thoughts and actually did overdose and was put in rehab different times over this medication. I went off this pill with out my doctor's permission because I didn't want this in my system anymore. I feel so much better now then when I was taking that medication. I have been off Effexor for now over 2 years. Thank God for taking this in my own hands and getting off this nasty medication. Xanax is much better for me and I only take it when I need it not like the Effexor. Plus I have no side effects with Xanax.

I started out taking the Effexor XR at a very low dose and was ""built up"" to the 150 mg a day,that I've taken for so long. About 4 years ago the medication was increased to 150 mg Am & 150 mg PM. About 1 year ago I noticed that the medication didn't seem to be working as effectively as it always had. So, about 8 months ago, my Dr added Wellbutrin SR 150 mg to my medications. I don't take the wellbutrin every day, just on those days that I feel is gonna be a really bad day. On those days I take 150 mg Effexor XR & 150 mg Wellbutrin SR AM and if I feel that I need it I take it the same way at night, before I go to bed. Over all The medication has worked very well for me."

I've just finished my second month of withdrawl down from 75mg to 0 mg of effexor. The last 4 or 5 days have turned out to be worse than any other. A lot of back and forth feelings of neverousness and calmness (it's more like my nerves are becoming more active, in a very unconfortable way, and directly reacting to the change in my body chemistry (Effexor withdrawl?). These nerveous reactions  do not seem to be related to my state of mind or thought process they just change directions at ramdom. There are periods when my nervious system calms down and I feel just fine. I have to admit the last few days (not counting today) I all most gave up, I believe the Effexor web site said it takes up to 3 months to clear out of your system so I plan to ride out the whole 3 months and decide then.
On one hand if I go back on the effexor I face nite terrors (screaming in my sleep, diving out of bed, waking up with bumps and bruses and having little or no memory of the event)(my wife and kids tell me about it in the morning) (my wife sleeps in a different bed room so she avoids any injury). On effexor, I have no memory of having any normal dreams. To be honest I love having  normal dreams (not nightmares) over the past two months, since I've been off effexor. I'm done for now and need to take a break.      "

2098$Condition: Depression$12/27/2008 1:53:29 AM$Reviewer: wagirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$4$"I started taking Effexor 2 years ago to treat severe depression and anxiety with heart palpitations.  My doc also put me on atenolol to control the palpitations, which is a nice combo because it reduces your blood pressure and prevents migraines.    After a year I felt better, like many of you who complained about wanting to get off it, and slowly tapered off.  What I have learned in the last year of horrible depression trying to do it ""on my own"" with diet, exercise, counseling, and the atenolol - is that going off was a horrible mistake.  I was feeling better BECAUSE of the Effexor XR.  I stopped working out, gardening, doing the things I love this year.  I am now back on it and committed to staying on it for at least two years straight this time.  I had tried Prozac, Celexa, Wellbutrin before with limited results on my depression and increased anxiety.  Effexor XR is the only one that has really helped both my depression and anxiety at the same time.  Within 24 hrs of starting it again, I already feel calmer, happier, more hopeful and at peace.  Life seems worth living and I am thankful for everyone in my life again too instead of ready to walk away from them all, lock myself in a hotel room, and cry for a few months like I was before I started it again.  Yes, decreased libido, difficulty achieving orgasm, don't drink more than one alcoholic drink or you will be sick and have the worst migraines and nausea ever, vivid dreams and some difficulty sleeping.  Overall, it has definitely been worth it. Definitely not a ""starter"" antidepressant, but it can be very effective when others don't work for you.  I recommend the XR version over the others to reduce side effects.  I am a therapist myself and sometimes people have biological causes of depressions that need something strong like this.  Commit to taking this one if you need it, and withdraw VERY slowly.  It can save lives.  It did mine."

I found gradually lowering the dose helps you get off.  I recently started back on the meds after I was diagnosed with Severe ADHD, BiPolar,Panic attacks, severe anxiety especially social, agorophobia, and Schizo-affective disorder.  I could not tolerate the psychotic (sp) meds side effects and my depression was kicking in (attempted suicide twice) so doc put me back on Effexor.  (Got off due to sexual side effects) Still hate the side effects, but would rather be happy and more healthy.  All is heriditary, lucky me!  So, I am on Effexor XR for depression and anxiety, another anxiety medication, and adderal for my ADHD.  So far, I feel okay, some shakes here and there, especially if I forget to eat since both meds decrease appetite.  Daugther (yes, it got passed down from my dad, to me, to by girls) is on prozac and seems to help with her high anxiety level and anger/depression.  Took her off Adderal after she became moody and irratable on it.  Would definately recommend finding which meds work for you.  Life is too short to spend it depressed and living with anxiety and panic attacks.  There is hope.  Good luck to all and God bless!

I know that it is the Effexor XR, because I never had a problem before, and a few months back I weened off the Effexor XR for a few months and was immediately able to achieve an orgasm.  But then I had to start taking it again because I started having panic attacks.  My Dr. suggested Lexapro - it supposedly has less sexual side effects, but I am happy with Effexor XR for the effectiveness on the panic attacks.

My dr. suggested this medicine.  It took me a month even to try it.  They started me off on 75mg and then put me to 150mg, it seems to work but my son is now 2 and I am ready to get off.  So I tried to get off of the medicine and that was hell.  I had ""ZAPS"" bad, shakes omg i thought I was dying.  I could not take it anymore so i started taking them again.  I am going to take myself off of them very slowly I have now been taking 75 mg for three months I am going to start taking 35mg next month and do that for 3 months and then do every other day for a month, and then maybe I will be free of this medicine.  I would never recomend this medicine to anyone.  If I do I will be sure to tell them about the withdraws they will have when they try and get off!!!!!"

I returned to the Dr. She INCREASED the dosage to 150MG and I was miserable, still hot flashing and my face began breaking out, making me look like some kind of meth junkie.My face was constantly breaking out after being on the lower dose but now I was a PIZZA FACE. I began to decrease the dosage and then I stopped the  madness by stopping the drug.

I will put up with the Flashes and  the dizziness but never will I go back on this CRAP for HOT FLASHES. My next letter is going to be to the FDA.

My doc says that this is suppose to give me energy and help me with my concentration, but so far i don't see any changes.  I'm also on Xanax because i have panic attacks and they seem to work, but i'm now having trouble sleeping at night, having crazy dreams, and a severe pain in my leg while i'm sleeping and i'm not sure if the effexor is causing this.

I have been off and on it for over 5 years - BUT - you cannot just stop taking it - or any anti-depressant! You have to taper the dosage slowly - which I have done several times over the years and have had no side effects or withdrawal.

However, taking it in the evening after dinner (instructed to take with food), I found several initial side effects; nausea, frequent urination, trouble sleeping, diarrhea. A few months ago I stopped a three month course of Cipralex because of side effects. Most troubling is the anecdotes refering to the withdrawal symptoms. It may be that having suffered almost lifelong melencholia, I should prepare myself to stay on one medication or another to improve my mood, but I'm concerned that the side effects and withdrawal, (should I chooose to stop) are not worth it. Currently I am experiencing a serious bout of 'situational' depression, (illness of my son), and this problem is long term and has little chance of resolving. Can an anti-depressant, such as Effexor, be helpful in dealing with this problem?

I lost all ability to have a spontaneous erection and performance on command was extremely difficult. About 1 year ago I successfully attempted to decrease my dose down to 75 mg over several months with little side effects, my sexuall function improved as I decreased the dose. When I tried to advance from 75mg down to 37.5mg I felt a mild form of intermitant Anxiety, started to have/remember  nightmarish dreams and desided to regroup at 75mg for several more months. At the begining of November 08 I decided to go from 75mg to 0. After a nite or two I started to have/remember my dreams and still do after about 30 days no nightmares that I can recall and I 've had my first natural spontaneous erection since starting effexor 5 years ago. The down sides: the first 8 to 10 days I was extremely emotional I mean I cried at sad car tunes, movies it was embarrassing but that went away after 10 days: I also had unusual sounds in my head (kinda hard to describe WHAAA Whaaa?)that disapeared after 10 days also. The last few days (27th to 29th I've started to have(unprompted by any events) intermittent,very mild anxiety, alternating with spells of peace and calm and last for several minuntes each and then disapate.

2179$Condition: Depression$11/24/2008 9:05:16 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$2$3$"This drug worked great (much better than other antidepressants) for me for a few years, then the good effects seemed to wear off.  Sexual side effects were awful also.

Also, this is not a scientific claim at all, but I and others have noticed that it seems to make you smoke a LOT more (if you smoke already)- I tried another bout w/ this drug recently and it didn't work how it did the first time - still made me smoke like a fiend though, and maybe even made me crave alcohol more, too.  

This drug is VERY hard to get off of.  I had the ""brain shivers"" for several MONTHS after reaching a 0 dose after tapering down off of it as slowly as possible. 

Looking back on this drug, considering its withdrawal symptoms and the fact that it didn't feel the same when I ""retried"" it is that I sort of felt/feel nervous that it changed my brain or something.  I feel like I am not nearly as smart/quick as I was before I ever took it.  I can't say that this drug caused that, but it seems to be the determining factor.  

So, I would say that anyone should be careful taking this drug b/c it is very powerful.  It can help a lot, but it is very easy to become dependent on, and might end up changing you.  It's not a good first choice for folks who just need ""a little help getting through the holidays"" or need a little help after a bad event.  It is more appropriate (in my opinion) for someone willing and able to continue w/ it (if it works well) for chronic/serious depression.

Effexor has worked the best of any drug I have tried in regards to Depression and Panic treatment. I am now up to 225mg per day, and I think I found my correct dosage. It has been months since I have experienced any panic attacks, and severe depression bouts are virtually gone as well. If you have started this medication, be sure to converse with your doctor frequently to find the dose that is best for you. Also, this is an SNRI drug- which means it works for serotonin and norepinephran- but, the benefits of norepinephran cannot be seen at a low dose; if you stop increasing at an early stage, you may as well be taking an ordinary SSRI like Zoloft, etc.

During my teen years it helped me concentrate in class as well. I started taking it at age 17 and recently stopped it due to pregnancy. Tapering off of it was not hard for me and I notice only slight physical symptoms of anxiety currently. (Since I learned how to cope without the medicine) It is category C for pregnancy so I decided to stop using it because the baby would be exposed to it. I believe it is worth it for my child's brain to function normally while in the womb. I had no side effects. The extended release capsules were a 'life saver' compared to the generic venlafaxin because the generic I had to take twice a day and I could not sleep; it disrupted my daily life. I tried 3 brands before this one and after 3-4 years of switching my doctor gave me this and it along with counseling helped me to learn to cope with life in a healthy way. My mother takes the same brand and it works for both of us better than any other brand. I keep suggesting it to my sister since I think depression could be hereditary in our family. I would recommend this medicine to anyone. I did not feel like it took over my mood or personality, it only allowed me to try to function normally and get my life back on track in a positive way.

BAD DECISION! 
Now 5 days into cold turkey and I am totally exhausted! My husband has had to wake me up out of horrible, fitful nightmares 4/5 of those nights, some only to continue when I fall asleep again. Mornings~ my body is sore from my minds' activities; running from..., inability to scream, though vocal(he says), flailing of arms and legs, night sweats, and just total mind and body exhaustion from the night's events. I have just left a message with my GP, after finding these posts, to see if he can help me to detox from this OR modify my rx.  My pain mgt. doctor doesn't like prescribing antidepressants anyway, nor did he even remember doing so, although he has been doing so for 3 yrs. 
I feel I should've been warned about these sorts of things happening, tho I do know that cold turkey isn't usually the right way to get off any medication. "

After a overdose of prescription drugs and a ER hospital stay I entered a Live-In rehab for a week. My Dr. prescribed EFFEXOR (150mg) daily. That was 4 yrs. ago, I don't drink anymore, seeming to be better but not making my life better. I tried Double the dose but I felt very angry towards friends who said the wrong thing or extreme Road Rage. I have went back to 150mg on  my own, but yet to see a Dr. about this. I like to be calm but I feel like life is passing me by at this point. I either want to take drug and feel happier or not at all. I'm open to try a much larger dose but I'm afraid I might go crazy! I am a 62 year old female, lost 2 jobs in 2 yrs., unemployed at the present, no boyfriend since 1998, and a Breast Cancer survivor of 7 yrs. I used to have anxiety issues to the extreme, but those went away after cancer treatment. I credit Effexor for ""evening me out"", but I feel like I need something more. My original Dr. moved away last year and I don't think the one I have now is that good. But now, with no insurance and limited income, it's not easy to try out different things. I have gotten Effexor from Canada Drugs for 4 yrs. to be able to afford them, but now I'm going to the County for help on that this Nov. Hopefully, the new Dr. I'll see will be able to help me realize WHAT I need! "

I feel worse now then when I started this crap. I have only been on this for about 10 months. I take 75mg a day. What I thought would be a tempory fix as turned into a nightmare. I am a week and a half into getting off this and it has been the worse experence in my life. Between the sweating, nausia, dieherria, and the brain surges in my head, I feel like I am looking thru a tunnel and if I move my head or eyes on have these brain surges that drive me nuts. I have not been able to sleep either. I can't imagine any doctor offering this to someone that is just having trouble with sleeping and being short tempered because of being premenopausal. I hope this doesn't go on for months like some of you have said. I am determined to get off of this completly. I have been 5 days without any at all. Very hard to drive and work but am doing the best that I can.

For the first 4 years it worked well, then seemed to stop working. My doctor increased the dose but that didn't help.  I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms if i was even a couple hours late taking my dose, or if i took it on a full stomach.  My doctor said it is common for drugs to loose effectiveness over time like this as your body gets used to it, so we decided to try a different medication, but when it came time to ween off the trouble really started. It has been nine months and I am still trying to ween off. The side effects are terrible. It causes horrible nightmares, nausea, sweating, irritability, and much more. If I had known how difficult it would be to stop taking this medication I never would have started it.

If she forgets a dose she suffers from severe headaches, dizziness/vertigo, irritability, sweating and sharp ""lightning like"" flashes going from her head to her toes.

Please if you are attempting to stop taking this medication, do yourself a favor and speak to your doctor first.  I'm sure they'll be able to give you a good guideline about how to correctly stop taking it.  Otherwise prepare yourself for a tough journey if you're trying to go ""cold turkey""."

It was a chronic depression that just lingered. I tried alternative therapies, diet, wellbutrin, paxil, ect with no results. Effexor is the only thing that has helped. For the first year it was a little up and down but it eventually smoothed out and I feel completely normal now. I do agree going off the medicine is difficult and am not sure if I will ever try.

They did NOTHING I was just really sad, and sleepy (not good with a new baby)I tried all sorts of things to make me feel a bit better, including exercise, acupuncture, herbal mixtures, smoking, counseling.  I think that Effexor was new on the market at the time and my Doc asked if I would like to give it a try which was about 10 years ago when my 1st child was nearly two, I couldn't believe the difference. I FINALLY felt 'alive' again, unfortunately when I fell pregnant with my 2nd one in 1998 the Doc took me off and put me on some other drug. I had terrible neck pain and low blood pressure - I even gave up smoking I felt so ill. When she was born I went straight back on the Effexor and have been on them ever since. In 2002 I had got myself down to 37.2mg and doing alot of exercise I never felt any withdrawal side effects. I then hit a 'BIG WALL' in my life and had to get the dose put back up, but then baby #3 decided to come along, Doc said stay on my Effexor since I'd been on it for so long - he didn't like my side effects from last pregnancy either.
I am currently on 150mg which I take every morning. If I don't take it by 1pm my fingertips go all tingly and funny and I soon remember, the longest that I have gone without is three days and I didn't know that I had forgotten them. 
Over the years my doses have varied, alot has to do with what's happening in my life.
I have been on these with drinking alcohol, and that was not too good, I now just have them every day and I find that even though life's little tests can make me feel like it is all up and down, I know that the Effexor is keeping me on an even keel and I believe that I am staying pretty level in my day to day feelings, and not going to extremes, as I had previously experienced.
I hope this review helps someone else, as I believe that you can't just 'solve' depression/anxiety in a few months."

It is your (along with your doctor's) responsibility to research new medications before starting to put them into your body. My doctor warned me about the side effects and let me make the decision to try Effexor to determine if the benefits outweigh the detriments. I have experienced increased sweating (I knew that to be a possible side effect) as well as the withdrawal symptoms many have described (""electrical storm in the head"", dizziness, etc.) but luckily, I knew what to expect and the effects were manageable. It is absolutely IMPERATIVE that you discuss ramping the dosage up/down when you start/stop Effexor XR. If your health care provider does not mention the possible withdrawal symptoms associated with missing a dosage or stopping Effexor ""cold turkey"", they do not know enough about this medication to be prescribing it. If this medication does not work for you (give it 6-10 weeks for full effect), taper the dosage and get off - try something else. I only remain on Effexor because it works to manage my depression. As common sense would indicate, do not stay on this medication if the benefits do not outweigh the side effects. The withdrawal symptoms will be worse than any of the side effects you experience on Effexor, but they ARE temporary (so far as we know) and will go away after ~ one week. I have been on and off different dosages for years and can tell you that it's not a drug to put in your body unless you are aware of and understand the potential undesired effects."

Effexor XR is wonderful for treating COL and restoring one's sense of well being BUT the problem occurs when you attempt to wean yourself from the medication. Make sure you do this at a time when little is required of you and you have time to rest up and understand that this medication does indeed carry significant withdrawal symptoms.

I had terrible headaches that rendered me useless at times. I felt suicidal, and it became increasingly worse. I became paranoid, and developed sleeping problems. Trying to come off of this dangerous drug was an equally terrifying experience. I was told that I couldn't start a different drug in the same ""category"" because of what these drugs-pain relieving antidepressants-are made of. And I just had to fight my way through it, tapering off from 300 mgs. daily. Luckily, a doctor prescribed depakote, and that has helped. 3 people in my family have been prescribed effexor at varying dosages through the years, from 37.5 mgs, to my 300 mgs., and not a single one of them has had a good thing to say about the experience.

I often experienced nightmares, sleeplessness borderlining on insomnia, and inability to achieve orgasm.  In addition to this, I do NOT like the idea of possibly having to increase my dosage, making me even more dependant on a drug that I personally do not believe was necessary in the first place.  I have missed doses in the past, and experience even worse side-effects, i.e. these 'electric shocks' that everyone seems to mention, strong mood swings, and even worse cases of insomnia.  Noting this only helps reinforce my decision to stop taking this medication, as the side effects will eventually cease...the only question being - how long?  I last took this medication 48 hours ago, and the electric shock feeling is the worst of the bunch.

These changes in mood were rapid and unexplainable...also felt hungry but threw up most everything I ate. I was tired and weak all the time and had disturbingly vivid dreams...it was enough to keep me from trying it again once I got insurance through my job.

The body aches, sweating, twitching and SEVERE Muscle spasms lasted for about 4 weeks.  The muscle spasms STARTED after about two weeks of being off medication.  That was actually the worst of all.  I was taking Clonazapam to help with that, which it did.  Again, I just need for people to know that all the terrible withdrawal symptoms will end.

Sickening headaches, nausea, insomnia etc. Now 6 months later, I have vivid dreams,and spasms in my limbs but nothing serious at all. I have previously taken valpro, lovan and Mirtazon. Effexor is the only medication that has helped me function as a normal happy person. I would love to be able to go off them, but as another person commented, it's better than the alternative.

My insurance provider HMO though county health care.  My coverage has been suspended and I cannot afford my medicine and I will be taking my last dose today about 9am.  After that I don't know what I will do.  I know your not supposed to stop taking it abruptly. I have ran out before and 2 two days later, my lips were numb, my brain was pausing, and I felt like I was outside of myself. I may only live another couple of days, because it can be fatal to just stop taking it. My insurance is gone and I do not have 180.00 to 225.00 dollars to have it refilled.  Before County cancelled my coverage, my perscriptions were only $1.00.  Anybody have any ideas as to what I can do about the Dr. who also let me go, (the one that gave me the scrip)who said she can't help me since my coverage was cancelled.  It sure seems like she would be responsible to at least try to contact the County Health Dept. to explain to them that she put me on meds that I JUST CANNOT STOP TAKING WITHOUT BECOMING A FATALITY. i MEAN DOES IT SEEM LIKE SHE WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MY LIFE ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE PHONE CALL, JUST TO COVER MY PERSCRIPTIONS OR EXTEND MY COVERAGE UNTIL SHE CAN WEEN ME OFF EFFEREX XR oral?"

My Dr. increased my dosage to 300mg last year and that has kept me from sleeping well but overall this drug has been a life saver for me.  The side effects of missing a dose are pretty harsh though.  Dizziness, electric sensations by afternoon if I forget to take it in the morning.  I think it may be contributing to mild claustrophobia that I've just recently developed - getting hot, woozy, anxious on long plane rides.

I had slight improvement in depression.  Had to go off of it because I wanted to get pregnant.  There are no words to describe the horrors of withdrawal.  It is horrendous.  I felt like I had the worst flu imaginable for 6 weeks.  And I went off of it very slowly for the 4 weeks prior to that.  I was vomiting, had vertigo, fever, exhausted, achy, literally unable to move a muscle without serious pain.  What saved me was that I got hold of a few non XR tablets of Effexor and I would take a very small bite (probably 5 mgs?) of it when I felt horrible.  That relieved my withdrawal for a few hours usually.  They don't make non XR anymore as far as I know but I would also call up the toll free Effexor line and scream at them whenever possible.  I would suggest that the company make the non-XR for this reason.

The side effects have been awful and your body goes into withdrawal even if you're late. I would say if your symptoms are not life-threatening (yourself or others)try something else!

This drug is not worth it!!!  I am in the process of quitting Effexor after about 1 year. While it did help at first with my depression and anxiety the withdrawal process is horrible! I did not receive any information about addiction/withdrawal from my doctor, pharmacist or the medication guide. According to the Effexor website this drug is not addictive - totally false! When I talked to my doctor about the lightheadedness I experienced each day as I would get close to the time to take the pills, she just said ""oh that's odd you are so sensitive to it"" and recommended that I take the pills at a different time. I also experienced extreme sleepiness daily. After slowly cutting down my dose over the last month I have now been off Effexor for 3 days. I am ok as long as I don't move my head or eyes which is impossible. I have a feeling somewhere between sea-sickness and electric shocks running through my brain. Combined with muscle aches and tension, nausea, insomnia and spontaneous crying I am not functional at this point. A nurse at my health provider told me today to expect these withdrawal symptoms to last at least one week. This experience has more than undone any good that Effexor has done for me. I am glad that the drug has helped some people, but i feel that it should be taken off the market. I'm afraid that what I'm experiencing now may be causing some damage to my brain that will come back to haunt me later. Although i have been diagnosed as dysthymic with several episodes of major depression since childhood, I am through with anti-depressants and all prescription drugs for now. My doctor had recommended that I try Cymbalta after getting off Effexor, but it reportedly also has strong withdrawal symptoms for many people. I don't want to go through this again. Don't risk your mental and physical health with Effexor!"
2368$Condition: Depression$9/27/2008 1:15:06 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$3$Good and bad experiences with Effexor. I was on this drug for about 2 yrs. I was on 75mg for one year and 150 the 2nd. It immediately helped with the depression/anxiety. It did affect my sleep, made me able to sleep an abnormal amount. Also, after waking I could wave my hand in front of my face and experience tracers, sometimes more intense than other times. One summer I went home from college and ran out of meds, withdrawal symptoms were intense!  Intense restlessness, weird vision, odd dizziness, mood swings, etc.  Mostly made my head feel strangely terrible and unlike it ever had before.  Resumed meds and returned to normal.  Now, I have been coming off the meds and have just fully come off them.  Withdrawal symptoms have been weird feeling in head, intense moods, lots of crying at one point, and now have been experiencing some stabbing pains in my torso that I am pretty sure have to do with the changes in meds. BASICALLY, this med can help but coming off is difficult and will make you experience things you never have before. Every person experiences it differently and lucky for me I think my case was not too bad.  Doctors should be educating their patients more thoroughly about this drug and it's effects.  This is a drug for mental conditions, and treating such a thing should not be treated lightly.  These are our lives we are dealing with.  Patients have the right to know more about what we are taking.

I even used it when i was 4 months pregnant and my son came out just fine......
I work in the mental health field and it is a medication highly recomended for it's use 
I take my dose in the evenings, I sleep well
no other side effects other than a decreased apetite...Oh!!! be carefull do not stop taking it suddenlly you wouldn't like the side effects ""dizziness, light headed and stomach cramps ""
if you wish to stop it, talk with your doctor and titrate slowly to avoid any discomfort

You will have a rough time for a little while.  But, YOU WILL GET THROUGH IT!!!!!  I PROMISE!  I have been trying to keep my posts up to date on when certain things are happening as well as how long they last in the hopes of helping others out there like YOU!  Talk to your doctor about maybe something for anxiety to help with some of your symptoms.  The stomach issues lasted less than a week.  Take Pepto Bismo or something like that to help ease that part.  I was just given Clonazapam, which has helped a lot with my twitching and muscle spasms.  It also helped me to actually get some sleep.  We are all here for you, OK?  If you have any other questions, ask it here and i will keep checking back.

Please know... This will not last forever.  OK??????

Let me first say: It DOES work. My depression and especially my anxiety have been non-existent while taking. However, the withdrawal symptoms are THE WORSE EVER. Even if I was late taking a dose (I usually take in the morning) by the afternoon, I would be nauseus, BRAIN ZAPS, headache, and very weak. When I take my meds, it goes away. I hate what this has done to me. I think this drug really needs to be taken off the market. It may work for depression and anxiety but the price you pay is not worth it. There are  other ways to deal with depression and others meds that don't cause such horrible side effects. I've gained 30lbs in 8 mos. I just talked to my DR. 2 days ago and he's starting me on a plan to start weaning off. I am so scared because I've read the horror withdrawal stories. But I am so desperate to get off this drug, that I'm willing to deal with the symptoms. If you are thinking about taking this drug: DON'T DO IT!!!
2395$Condition: Depression$9/20/2008 2:47:51 PM$Reviewer: kchilds, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$1$5$"I am going to try and keep up with posting my withdrawal symptoms and how long they are lasting.  I hope this will be useful for others going through that hell.  Just returned from the doctor about my SEVERE muscle spasms.  I MEAN SEVERE!!!!  They started two days ago.  You can't sleep.  It HURTS!!!!!  :/  He put me on Clonazapam to ease that and said I may have to endure another week of this.  The headaches are going away.  I am no longer sick to my stomach all the time.  Sweating has eased up a lot.  AllI can say is, if you are trying to stop taking this medication, you will need to endure some awful side effects.  DO NOT GIVE IN and start taking them again.  It will be hard, but it will end.

I hope and pray someone will find some confort with this information.  Again, you are not alone and it WILL go away.  I will post again once I am ME again.  I just wish this information was available when I first tried to get off it!!!!

Good luck to everyone!!!!"

I think the side effects are different in males and females. Effexor XR DID help with my depression and anxiety, BUT, I did GAIN WEIGHT!!!  I went from 120 pounds to almost 160 in a very short time frame.  THAT made me more depressed.  I was not eating a lot.  So while the medication did help make me feel better and ease my anxiety attacks, I did suffer from weight gain and dry mouth.  Due to losing my job, no insurance and no money, I have been OFF Effexor XR for 10 days now.  THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE!!!!.  My Doctor DID NOT tell me about the side effects of coming off Effxor XR.  I have been throwing up constantly, dizzy all the time, flu like symptoms, can't sleep, severe body aches.........  It is amazing how horrible the withdrawal symptoms are.  I just want others to know that they are NOT CRAZY and are NOT ALONE.  I have been trying to find out how long this will last to no avail.  I feel suicidal because I do not know what to do to ease these symptoms, but I WILL NEVER GO BACK to Effexor XR....EVER!!!!!  DO NOT TAKE unless you intend to be on it for a LONG time and understand all possible side effects.

Still had horrible withdrawal symptoms after stopping that for only a day and a half: dizziness, nausea, headache, buzzing in head, diarrhea. My husband had the idea to open the capsule and divide up the medicine even further, so it's an even more gradual modification than stopping the 37 mg. Just sprinkle it on applesauce, but don't crunch or chew. I've been on approx. 25 mg. for about 5 days now. Getting ready to lower that even more. The side effects are not nearly as bad. Still get a bit of headache, dizziness, and nausea after about 12 hours, but it's much more tolerable. I'm hoping this will be an easier way to stop completely. I'll know more in another week or so. Good luck to everyone.

2430$Condition: Depression$9/8/2008 5:27:03 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"I guess the fact that a drug doesn't work on some individuals doesn't make it a BAD or DANGEROUS drug then, when it DOES help or work on some others. I've read up the reviews on most antidepressants & can see that almost everyone experiences side-effects & withdrawal symptoms - some none, some mild, & others severe. They say ""No pain no gain.""
Doctors aren't know-all, so it's best if one does some research on their own & not rely fully on their doctor for info. 
One has to weigh the pros. & cons. of taking a drug themselves, not getting discouraged by others' unpleasant experiences. For example, before taking Effexor, I was sad 24/7. I would curl up in bed whole day, re-playing hurtful & unpleasant memories from past,& getting so worked up over them (angry/sad) all over again. I kept thinking of all sorts of sad things & just cried & cried. I wanted my husband to stay with me all the time; I was so demanding. I didn't want to go out or do anything. My world was so dark & gloomy. I even got suicidal, thinking of quick & painless ways to die. Everything seemed hopeless, like I was never going to get better, ever. I just wanted to die. Or I believed I was seriously going insane. Now, although Effexor mostly makes me so drowsy & fatigued & causes some other inconveniences, I'd rather suffer from these for a while than go back to the miserable & horrifying state I was in, which was a whole lot more difficult for others to deal with.
One last thing, if you can afford it, try counseling by a psychologist. It sped up my recovery by miles."

It's true as some said that doctors don't seem very informed about the full scope of side-effects of this drug, or they hesitate to tell because they're afraid to scare off the patients.:) My doctor only told me about having dry mouth & sweating more, but you probably agree that those are the least of concerns. I did look up more on all possible side-effects on the net; was shocked at how bad they can be, but since the med. did help me feel better mentally & emotionally (coupled with psychotherapy), I didn't bother trying to see how I'd do on other drugs. Doctor increased my dose slowly,& I experienced almost all the side-effects, particularly extreme drowsiness & fatigue. Now my dose is very slowly being reduced; had some mild withdrawal symptoms for about 10 days, & feeling so much better (less sleepy & tired) afterwards. Now on 112.5mg & things seem to be going pretty well. Good med. in general for me. Personally, I don't mind the withdrawal symptoms, though severe, as long as I can get rid of depression, which is a more serious concern to me & debilitate me more in all sense than any side-effects/ withdrawal symptoms, which are mainly physical.

I work out 5-6 times a week at the gym, and eat semi-healthy 80% of the time.  I couldn't figure out why I would gain instead of lose weight.  So I added a running regimen into my workouts....same thing- no lose of pounds.  In between all of that, my sexual desire went to nothing.  So, for the sake of my marriage I called my ob/gyn who put me on effexor for bad pms(I did ask to be put on something)  I was told my only option was to lower my dose, so we did.  I went back down to 75mg- then ot was no sleep, bad dreams,short-tempered.  So, I called back two weeks later and stated that I wanted to switch to a drug that had NO sexual side effects.  After 8 days, i finally got an answer(because of my moodiness, I had called 4 more times in that period)  I was told okat to switch, and I had asked for wellbutrin, since there was suppose to be no sexual side effects.  All good, until day 3- thats when the real bad moodiness, and lots of tears came in. 4th day dizzy, and nauseated all day.  My eyes had a glassy look to them.  Couldn't even stay the whole day at work.  Called my sister who is a pharmacist, and told her what was going on I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAPERED OFF OF THE EFFEXOR!!!!  My doctor never said a word about it.  NEVER even mentioned that I might have drug withdrawals from the effexor.  I ended up having serious withdrawals- hot flashes, dizzy, nauseated, terrible lfe like dreams.Crying over nothing and everything.It was one of the WORST experiences I have ever been through. Today I am on day 12 of NO EFFEXOR!!!  I would never recommend this drug to anyone.  The drug withdrawals can last anywhere from 10 days to 3 weeks.  I had started taking the wellburtin, and on day 5 I called my doc. office crying, and the told be to add another half a pill.  I did, and now I want to be on nothing, so I am down to half a pill a day!!!!!  No drug should ever make a person feel that way.

2459$Condition: Depression$8/19/2008 8:39:52 AM$Reviewer: alb, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have worked for several years with my doctor and mental health therapist to find ways to minimize the symptoms of chronic depression with exacerbations of seasonal affective disorder.  After much experimentation we hit on the combination of taking Wellbutrin year-round for the chronic depression and adding Effexor XR in varying doses throughout 9 months of the year to treat the seasonl affective disorder.  
I start taking 37.5 mg of Effexor in the middle of August, increasing to 75 mg at the middle of October and to 112.5 mg at the end of November.  I maintain that dose all winter, until the beginning of April when I begin decreasing the dose at about 3-week intervals so that I'm off the Effexor by the middle of May.
I have tried decreasing the dose more quickly than that, but like many others have reported, the side effects made me very uncomfortable.  (I have learned, when weaning off, to carry one 37.5 mg capsule with me to take if I'm feeling especially uncomfortable, but find I have rarely needed to take it.)
While the medicine has been indispensable in relieving my suffering, I also must report the importance of behavioral interventions – showering and getting dressed every day, getting outside daily (even if it’s just to sit on the porch), calling or visiting friends when I’m feeling down, and seeing my mental health therapist and/or doctor when I’m feeling overwhelmed.  They help me to see how my thoughts may be contributing to the depression and how I can get back on track.
If you are suffering, don’t give up.  Try the interventions your doctor suggests, and let him or her know what works and what doesn’t so that your treatment can be tailored to you.

I just had to wean myself off of it a couple of months ago because my insurance is changing and I can no longer afford it. I did have weird dreams when I first started taking it and I would sweat alot in my sleep. I'm assuming this was caused by the Effexor because I'm no longer having those problems. As far as weight gain, I lost and gained weight on it, so I believe it has no effect on weight. I believe I gained weight by eating lots of fast food and rarely exercising. I do believe it slowed down my weight lost process making it harder to lose weight. I start on Celexa tomorrow and hoping it works as well as Effexor!

Rather than make me feel better, it has made me not feel at all.  I finally realized how much I was missing in life because I could not enjoy things while taking this med, so my doctor is very slowly taking me off of it. 

I have quit taking it before, and because of life circumstances, I was put on it again.  The withdrawal I experienced from this med is unlike anything I ever experienced before.  I got all of the usual things; flu-like symptoms, brain shocks, anger, sadness, hopelessness, and more.  This time I am taking Geodon and Wellbutrin SR to help with the withdrawal.  It has helped quite a bit to take these meds!  I do still have some withdrawal symptoms, but not even close to as much as I had before.

In all, I think that Effexor XR can be very helpful to a depressed person, but  people need to know about the withdrawal BEFORE they start it!"

Then, I begin to have anxiety attacks out of the blue. I was taken off this medication immediately. If you have ever had an anxiety attack, it feels just like the words suggest, AN ATTACK. That was the scariest feeling in my life. I was in Walmart doing what I normally do (look around) and instantly I felt beyond overwhelmed with all that was going on around me.

It really helped me. Regretably my doctor never told me that there would be withdrawl symptoms until after I had been on the med. for 2 months. Since it was giving me my life back, I have stayed on it for 2yrs. I never planned on remaining on the drug forever, so after talking with my doctor, I have been ""stepping down"" over the past 2wks. I have 3 days left on 37.5 mg. then I'm done. I've had mild withdrawl symptoms such as fatique ,slight nausea, and lightheadedness.  Most often the symptoms are greatly minimized by late afternoon. Eventhough the med. really helped me get through a horrible time in my life I will be glad to be totally off of it.
I will be all the wiser the next time I am prescribed medication for anything. I will make certain that I am knowledgable of a drugs side effects and potential for dependency before I ever start taking it, no matter how bennificial it may be. Instead of solely trusting the doctor to inform me."

Have been taking Effexor for 10 months. Am goin'thru the cold-turkey withdrawal stuff. It ain't pretty! Was diagnosed as being bi-polar/depressed when having anxiety over our $$$ woes. My doc sent me to a psych who wanted to put me on Trazadone for sleep, Stay on Effexor(75 mg.),and add 3 mg.Invega (the ""new"" lithium). Hmmm, well folks I felt like a zombie-just numb. No thanks, would rather feel sad or anything but that ""zoned-out"" thing. And really don't think I am bi-polar. Have never experienced that mania thing you read about where you don't sleep for days. Guess the best thing I have learned from this is get educated before you take anything. My doc did not discuss the withdrawal fun. Will be so glad when my ears quit ringing! And got so queasy on day 2 that I threw up a salad. Yuck. Am making a committment to myself to eat better and exercise. Work on my relationship with God, my husband, friends, and spoil my dogs. Try living in the moment and being thankful. This is what really works for me. Best of luck to all ya'll struggling with mood swings. Sending you happy thoughts!       "

I used to feel too tired and depressed to exercise, and it didn't help me.  It only made me want to eat more, and I gained about 20 lbs over that time period.  I am NOT prone to such weight gain. I've felt a bit better, but that's because my situation has changed and I've moved to a better place.  If I continue to gain weight, I will be really upset.  My clothes don't fit anymore.  I was really scared to stop the drugs, but since I moved I'm no longer on the same health care plan, so I can't see the doctor who prescribed Effexor.  I noticed that I didn't feel any side effects when I was late taking Effexor, so 3 days ago I thought I'd try to see what would happen if I waited a few more hours.  I felt none of the really frightening side effects that users on this site and others have reported.  I figure better to get off it before my body becomes dependant.  I did get some uncomfortable stomach cramping when eating dinner last night, so I took some pepto bismol and took about 1/3 of my 150 mg capsule and woke up feeling great.  More energy than I've had while on Effexor.  I'm scared that I'll feel some scary side effects soon, but so far, thank God, I feel fine.  I wouldn't recommend going cold turkey, as most folks seem to have experienced absolute hell.  I wonder why I was so lucky.

For the most part it was good. I stopped crying and could go to work. The first week I took it I slept very little and couldn't go to work. After that week I was fine. I took the medication for about a year. I'm currently off of it. All I can say is UGH! This has not been fun. I stopped taking it about a week ago. It's 3am and I can't sleep. My stomach is upset 80% of the time I am wake. I suddenly get very hungry. I'm dizzy everytime I turn my head. I tapered off the medication like I was told to by my Nurse Practioner. Sadly, my Nurse did not warn me about the side effects of withdrawal. I was only taking 75mg. It worked well while I was on it though.

Four years ago, I began taking Prozac for depression and Klonopin for anxiety.  I did really well with that combination except for one thing: my sex drive died. As a result, I asked my Dr to change my medication, and he reluctantly changed me to Wellbutrin and Lexapro.  My sex drive returned but I was miserable.  I ended up in Detox.  After that, I tried Cymbalta and Amitriptyline which did not help and had bad side effects.  Finally, I tried Effexor.  Its a miracle.  The very next day I felt 'normal'....something I hadn't felt in years but instinctively knew was right.  I have experienced no weight gain with  Effexor, my sex drive has returned, and I am 15 months sober.  I want to make 3 points.  1)Effexor is great for ME, 2)don't give up until you find what's right for you...its worth it, 3) some side effects aren't as bad as you think if you weigh all the consequences (i.e. no sex drive would have been better than ending up in Detox).  Good Luck!

I asked my doctor if I could try Effexor because of the profound effect it had on my sister. It has not had as drastic an effect on me, but I am functioning, and the depression is no longer debilitating as it once was. I take 300 mg. per day, and tried to go higher, but couldn't tolerate the side effects of a higher dose, esp. nausea. The downside is that I understand Effexor is a very difficult drug to stop taking (there is a ""discontinuance syndrome""), so I'm likely to be on it for life."

Started Effexor 13yrs ago and now take 225mg daily. Prescribed for depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, perimenopause. It has numbed me.  Side effects include: nightmares, much weight gain, blurred vision, loss of sex drive, confusion to the point of not being able to function, lost motivation. No longer want to be with people. Hard to feel any emotion except saddness/hopelessness. I'm certain it caused a problem with sleeping and got to the point that I was extremely fatigued.  Tests showed extremely low oxygen level when resting.  No energy.  Now sleep with a bi-pap machine which helps.  I was not overweight at the time. At first felt calm, but developed into talking too much, almost an excited/silly behavior that eventually passed after a few years. Tried to discontinue with the following side effects: extreme anxiety, anger over little things, aggressiveness,  crying spells, fearful (not my personality). I retired early due to not being able to function at my job. Now I feel really ignorant for not realizing the medication was causing many of these symptoms. I stayed on the drug because other meds hadn't worked for depression. My doctor said to ease off dosage by decreasing one pill per month.  Still horrible side effects and after two months of being completly off started back on meds.  You are asking why?  I just got tired of feeling so anxious and tearful or angry.  Not feeling was easier.  Guess I am very weak.  Am planning on changing doctors and again asking for help in discontinuing it.  I have a loving husband and children, but life is just too hard.   "

I thought I am going crazy - which is a pretty short ride for me. W/o Effexor- I just have panic atacks quite severe. BUT with Effexor, I got anxiety episodes - when I would worry about global warming, wars, weather -, vivid dreams/ nightmares which make Stephen King's books look like bedtime stories, debilitating physical symptoms - I would have to stay in bed for hours. Scarier though are the emotional and cognitive symptoms.I would feel like a stranger in my own body, in my own house and even in my own life. I never did drugs - but all the symptoms I have on Effexor are very close to what I imagine someone feels when stoned. BUT THE WORST IS I STARTED DRINKING - AND I NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD THIS PROBLEM. I FELT IN MY GUT THAT I AM NOT AN ALCOHOLIC, BUT COULDN'T EXPLAIN BEYOND THIS. AND I STARTED SMOKING AGAIN, ALTHOUGH I QUITTED 9 YR AGO. I want off this drug ASAP - anxiety and panic attacks are nothing compared to the living hell this med got me in.

However it never really took away the anxiety. I would feel no emotion whatsoever and had no sex drive at all. I am currently getting off of it and have brain zaps. I did this because I am not depressed anymore as well as I started a new job with no insurance. Due to money issues I cannot afford the full price of this medication. I weeded myself off of it per week and have been feeling these side effects for 3 weeks now. I feel dizzy, nausea, major anxiety (I cry 3 times a day at the drop of a hat), tired, and angry because of these symptoms.

Effexor is best, although I fall in to denial of needing medication at all. It's true it has side effects, especially when you try to go off it, but weaning and keeping to as low a dose as possible should be the norm for ANY med! It helped me more than Prozac because it is a SNRI and not just a SSRI. That makes a difference for me. I still cried a lot on Prozac and lost sleep. For us diehard depressives, the worst side effect of all is committing suicide, right? Effexor helped me feel positive and productive. My BP med is also necessary though it has side effects--beats having a stroke! Sure, sexual interest declines but that happens without meds, to me. I say be grateful for the medication advances of this era, it sure beats the 1970-80's or earlier! I do manage side effects of Effexor by staying on 75 rather than the 150 I was on, to feel less robotic, as I saw it. 300 certainly sounds like a big dose to me and I've been hospitalized with depression 3 times. When ""weaning"", give yourself at least 3-4 weeks to gradually go off. I laugh that it is like a nuclear reactor going on and coming off line. But I don't want to go hang from a tree anymore. One day, maybe I will show true acceptance and quit going off my meds!"

It has changed me. I am a more positive worry free person. I don't get afraid anymore. I used to have bad nervous panic attacks. I could not deal with negative and stressful issues at work. Now i am more livelier (my co-workers have noticed), I laugh more. Joke more and feel so much more RELAXED. Social gatherings are so much easier to be in. My hangups and fears are no minimal. 
As for side effects I did have headaches and blurred vision. Seems like the have subsided.. I only take the medication when I am ""PMS""ing. I don't take it on a daily basis and my body does not feel side effect from that. 
Everyone is different Physiologically and tht is what we must understand!!!"

If only I had read these reviews first!  I started at 37.5 then up to 75...still had night sweats, still was irritable and now I have gained an additional 15 lbs or so in the 2 months I have taken this drug.  I also picked up restless leg syndrom, extremely vivid nightmares and absolutely no sex drive or ability to fullfill a sexual experience if you get my drift...this stuff is horrible.  so I started weening myself off by taking one every other day to finally off completely.  I have experienced severe dizziness, brain zingers, nausea but I discovered DRAMAMINE...it does not make the dizziness go away completely but it is at least tolerable and the nausea is gone.  I am focusing now on excercise and a completely healthy diet to avoid going through this ever again with any other magical pill a Dr. can prescribe....so I guess I could say Effexor helped me get a perspective on how important my health is and I am determined to self medicate through diet and excercise...  Good luck to all of you trying to get off this horrible horrible drug.

I have been taking Trazodone for years to help with sleep and combat Fibromyalgia.  I was prescribed Effexor several years ago when the long Minnesota got to me. It was supposed to reduce the pain from the FMS also.  I have never gone above the minimum dose of 37.5 mg.  I have gradually gotten sicker and sicker and have gained a huge amount of weight. I have taken a circuitous route in searching for my health again and started a Ph balancing program which saved my life. 
I have been hearing bad things about SSRI's and really want off of them. Did you know that seratonin comes from the digestive track? Anyway,I stopped the meds and suffered horrible withdrawals! After 2 weeks I finally got some St. John's wart and doubled the dose.  It helped a bunch!  But just yesterday I listened to an audio by Ann Blake Tracy (www.drugawareness.org)which scared me into a different approach to wean off. It's day 2 of taking a reduced dose of Effexor and all of the physical health benefits I've gained in the past weeks are gone. Okay,  they just feel gone.  But it is critical that you wean off very slowly. If not,  the withdrawal can come back even 6 months later.  These drugs get out of the system but remain in the brain for several years.

In summary, it helped for a short time.  But the long term effects are not worth it.  I am lucky to still be married.  And alive.   "

This together with hot flashes, stomach cramps, bowel problems, and a sense of great fatigue. I thought it was all due to menopause. I had had a thyroid extraction 13 years ago due to cancer. Finally, one doctor told me I had a chemical imbalance and that Effexor would be good for me. I'm very pessimist what concerns medications, but after so much aggravation I decided to give it a try. In one week I had no pain, my 15 HF/day had gonne down to 2 or 3 (much milder though), and all the other symptoms desappeared. I miss one day and they all come back. I am on 75mg for 5 months now and the dr. didn't tell me nothing about increasing the dose. She did tell me I may start withdrawing from it after one year... I pray for that. If I will have to stay on it for the rest of my life (as I have to take my med for the thyroid everyday for the rest of my life) I'll do so. 
I have been having very vivid dreams, but none agressive or nightmares. Actually they are quite intricate and funny, like if I were watching a movie.
I didn't put 5 starts for satisfaction because of all the reviews I've been reading and the problems with withdrawl. I surely won't be satisfied if I'll have so much trouble to get out of it!

I'm glad we have the chance to warn the public about this horrible drug. I don't care which experts say this medication is not addictive - they lie!!! It helps you in the beginning after you get passed the initial side effects. You then feel almost euphoric and happy. As you progress with the 'treatment' then I (along with many others) began to notice a change. You think you're just more confident and can't understand why everyone else thinks you've become an arrogant ass. That's because you are and don't realize it. You may become angry and act like a complete fool at 'the drop of a hat'. Then the darkness begins to cloud you're mind and you realize you've become a 'legal' junkie. You need this to feel in control. Nightmares may occur whenever you are able to actually sleep, dry mouth, weight gain, constipation, mood swings, dizzy spells and migraine headaches begin to occur more often; until you realize you're lost in a drug induced maze. I'm am fighting the worst battle of my life coming off of the Devil's candy. It will eventually destroy you.

(I've been on antidepressants since 1975.) I take 300mg in the morning and 75mg at night, along with Wellbutrin. . Effexor has worked very well most of the time. I still have the chronic crashes occasionally that can last for months, but that is the nature of the disease. I have none of the nausea, dizzy, or aggressive etc symptoms I read about here. The addictiveness is the only negative. I have gone into severe and dibilitating withdrawal when trying to trim down the dosage.  If I miss a dose I start wringing my hands, and become jumpy and fearful - even irrational. That makes me paranoid about running out, not being able to afford it, etc. even to the point of panic attacks. Antidepressants are also sneaky because you can think you are well and don't need it, when actually it is the pills themselves that make you better. If given a choice, I would still take the medication. It keeps me mostly non-suicidal (very rare - usually if pill supply is threatened) and as stable as one can expect. Yes I get angry about addictiveness, but I really appreciate not being so severely depressed, and being able to be functional, and at times even happy. I know too well the opposite.

Sounded like a wonder drug to me, and you know what they say about that.... if it sounds too good to be true, it is!  Well, I suffered through 2 weeks of nausea, a feeling of being in a light fog and restless nights.  After one month the nausea had disappeared and my dreams became weird causing me to wake up in a cold sweat and my mood swings were worse and the fogginess never went away.  This is the low dose, remember?  I came to WEB-MD and read what everyone else was saying and decided I did not want to continue on with this drug, which had done nothing for my meopause symptoms, IBS or Fibro...and in fact I had no appetite and lost 10 lbs...only plus I can think of!

Then I progressed to the 75 dose I began experiencing fatigue and headaches; but I was beginning to feel more at ease and had better concentration and I was ready for the 150 dose, according go my doctor. When on the  150 dose I was at times experiencing extreme fatigue and weight gain, along with headaches and chronic constipation. However, I was extremely happy with the results in the beginning. I had self confidence that I never had before and was convinced that I would use this drug forever. I was calm and level headed and for once liked myself. Over a period of time I noticed my growing dependence on this drug. My weight gain was out of control and I bruised very easily. My self confidence turned into aggression that raged out of control. My family would not accompany me anywhere during this time because my temper was out of control and I would 'mouth off' to anyone who looked at me wrong. Then the dizzy spells started to occur and nightmares started. It has been a long road to hell and back trying to get off this drug. I will succeed in getting my life and family back. I'm now at the 75 dose again and my body is craving more Effexor - it's unreal. Next week I'll try to cut the dose to 37.5 but I am afraid because of all the hell I'm going through to get off these pills. Effexor XR will make a 'junkie' out of you - just because it's legal doesn't make it any better than the illegal street drugs. The symptoms are the same and it can eventually ruin your life.

My anxiety and anger was gone after a few weeks. I stopped fighting with my husband and co-workers everyday. I was able to take difficult situations in stride. The worst side effect was dry mouth. I will say that after reading some of these reviews I'm terrified to ever go off of the Effexor XR.

Now at 150mg dose this medication has helped me to be calm in the beginning and I have more self-confidence now. The downside is I've become more of an aggressive, rude and outspoken person. Normally, I'm not rude or aggressive at all and my temper is flaring very often and the calm feeling is diminishing. It's almost as if I'm looking to be challenged and I've got to win at any cost. I've had chronic constipation, night sweats and arguments with my husband over petty things. He's asked me to please stop taking this medication. I want to stop but I'm afraid that I'm now a 'legal' drug addict. My dependence on this medication makes me feel weak and ashamed; but I panic if I miss a dose and I keep some in my car, purse and work just in case I forget it. I tried to stop taking it by cutting down on the dose and I cried for two days. This is a nightmare and I promised myself that I would never be dependent on anything or let anything control me; a promise now broken.

The nausea was the worst, but it disappeared when I moved to 75mg, and after the first few weeks, the other side effects have been minimal; mostly dry mouth and vivid dreams.

Negative:  Big issues with constipation.  I was having issues with clenching my jaw, but that seems to have gone away.

All in all, this seems to be a very effective drug.  I was a little bit scared of taking it due to all the negative posts on here, but so far I haven't had any major issues.  I take it at the same time every day, however, I did travel outside of my time zone and was several hours late in taking my meds.  I had no ill effects other than ""Shoot, I forgot to take my pill!""

On a side note:  Before starting on this medication, I was having problems with pains in my legs and leg jerking while sleeping.  Both of these issues have completely stopped (my husband is thrilled that the night leg jerking has ceased)

However, I've tried to come off it twice and accidentally stopped taking it once. Each time, I got so dizzy that it was hard to function and the mood swings were horrible. I had little weight gain and enjoy the great feeling while on it so I have no desire to stop taking and no need to stop. But, the withdrawl symptoms are horrible. I've tried several different meds until I found this. But none of them had the withdraw symptoms that this does. Great if you want/need to stay on it, but horrible to come off it. "

The only issue I had while taking it was the side effects when a dose was taken late or missed.  I experienced tingling fingers and lips, my brain would feel like it was in a fish bowl that got seriously jostled.  I would feel discoordinated and would sometimes slur my words.  However, when taken routinely, with out missing a dose I would have no problems.  I did gain 30 pounds on it.  Now that I have stopped I have already lost 20 of those pounds.  The one question I would like to see asked is: ""How hard is the drug to come off of.""  I don't think enough people realize just how hard it is.  I have never been a drug user, so I cannot make the comparison, but imagine it is very similar to detoxing.  And I decreased slowly from 225mg at the direction and supervision of my psychiatrist.  It was horrible.  However, given where I was when I started the Effexor, I would do it all over again because it probably saved my life.  But be prepared for when your are ready to stop this medication.  Get your family prepared, come up with a plan of action and have constant support.  Coming off of the Effexor has definetly been one of the hardest things I have ever had to do."

Physically, I get these little ""shocks"" through my body. Don't want to be a slave to this drug the rest of my life.

2657$Condition: Depression$5/16/2008 9:23:51 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$2$This is the worst pill I have evr taken in my life! I was taking 225MG everyday for a year and a half and I had very little side affects while I was taking it (trouble sleeping,nightmares,profuse sweating)but it seemed to lose effectivness very quickly. Rather than continue to up my dosage I was switched to 300MG of Wellbutrin once a day. I felt better while taking both medications but now that I am trying to get off of the Effoxor Xr I feel like I'm dying! I have gone from super happy to crying to total rage all within the last 2 hours. I was instructed to slowly lower my dosage over 2 weeks which I did and I don't think that was slow enough. I can not focus and I feel like I am going to vomit every second of the day. The pain in my head is not even comparable to a headache or migrain. Everytime I turn my head I feel like I am going to fall over and driving HA! thats a joke.I have been completley off of this pill for only 3 days and I have fully come to understand why addicts relapse. This should not be on the market and it should not be given out as quickly as it is. Doctors don't tell you that hey it may work for awhile but then when you come off of it you are worse than before you started taking it. I would NEVER recommend taking this regardless of how bad you think your depression is. Trust me it is much harder to deal with the thoughts and feelings while coming off this drug than it is to deal with the depression. If you do feel you need medication which I agree some do such as myself all I can say is do your research before you take anything, I wish I had done that.I would love to know if there is anything I can do to ease the withdrawl symptoms, please if anyone can help let me know before I end up taking another pill to make it stop!

Not good for anyone who has also had an eating disorder. And nightmares, which Ive had problems with before effexor, are now worse than they ever have been. GAH! Makes me not want to sleep.

2672$Condition: Depression$5/10/2008 1:28:04 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I have been taking Effexor XR 75mg for 4.5 years now.  It has given me my life back.  

It took me a long time to admit that I might be depressed, as I didn't want to face what I perceived as a stigma against depressed folks as deficient in character, lacking in faith, or ""crazy.""  Finally things got so bad (not getting out of bed on the weekends, suicidal thoughts), that I 
""gave up"" and went to see a counselor.  That was the best decision of my life (other than marrying my wife.. although I guess you could say that THAT wouldn't have happened had I not sought help!).

So after seeking help seven years ago I was diagnosed with double depression and started off with Prozac.  That didn't work, so switched to Zoloft.  Zoloft worked on my depression and I can vividly remember the joy of seeing leaves rustle in sunlight about 5 weeks after starting Zoloft and feeling happy for the first time years.  I gained 20 pounds of fat and lost my sex drive almost completely, but I was so happy to be ""alive"" again that I lived with those side effects for a couple of years.  Eventually I wanted more, so I dropped Zoloft cold turkey, lost weight, sex drive came back, but so did depression.  Finally got on Effexor XR and it has been a miracle.  A little sex drive lessening but not a lot, and no sexual function problems at all.  My depression has stayed away for the 4 years I've been on this drug.  

This drug has worked wonders for me, and I hope that it will for you.  Realize that no one drug works for everyone, and that you do have to try out different medications to find the one for you.

One thing -- if I skip a dose I can immediately tell, because I get a little dizzy, a little headache, etc.  I've heard that trying to go off Effexor can be very tricky.  Apparently if you want to go off you need to gradually lower the dose or switch to another med that can help while you're coming off of Effexor and then ""wean"" off of that.

God bless."

2680$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/7/2008 7:21:53 AM$Reviewer: Laura, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $1$1$4$The problem was that it was too easy to use and not easy to stop using.  It has created side effects worse than the depression I first started taking it for.  I now have episodes of extreme anger, and self harm and fear that I may one day harm one of my young children.  I am very distressed with the fact that I have tried to taper off and have severe withdrawals.  I am more depressed because of the side effects and withdrawals than I was before I began taking Effexor. I wish I had sought a more natural approach to depression such as diet changes, exercise, and support groups.  I am disappointed that my insurance will pay for this drug and not for the herbal supplements that have been more effective and not detrimental to my health?  Why do they allow me to take a medication that is causing me physical and mental harm and yet shun the very things that could improve my health in every arena?  I am angered that I have lost ten years of my life and have damaged the relationships with my loved ones due to side effects and inability to quit taking this medication. Those who promote this drug need to know that I fully regret taking Effexor when there are other avenues. More natural, healthy and effective methods should be actively encouraged before prescribing such a  damaging drug. This should be a LAST alternative, if not totally banned.

It worked well; my hot flashes all but subsided within a few days.  However, now a few years later, my blood pressure rose very high(up to 240/150) over the month of April 2008 with headaches and loss of conciousness twice from blood pressure elevation while driving.  I am now not allowed to drive, climb ladders, steps(which means I can't sleep in my bed but fold out couch which is uncomfortable, mow grass because of the possibility of passing out. This is horrible since we live in a small town 1/2 hour from nearest medical facility.
Within the past month, my blood pressure meds have been increased or new ones added multiple times to try to lower my pressure.  In the meantime, multiple tests were done for the obvious reasons for high BP---all negative.  These included brain tumor, adrenal tumor, kidney problems, hormonal. Last week of April and beginning of May had adverse effect from a blood pressure med causing my pressure to drop up to 100 points which caused me to pass out and to be hospitalized for IV fluids to bring my pressure back up to 100.  It was like a yoyo.  Horrible month.
In hospital for another battery of tests, with all negative.  Effexor stopped and most of BP meds stopped.  Then blood pressure was too low.  Am now very tired, shaky, lip tremors, antsy since med stopped after tapering.  This is not worth the hot flashes--I would rather have them than what I have gone through the past month and half and more since I can't drive."

Went back to 75mg for several more years.  Positives - no noticeable depression.  Negatives:  Insomnia, anxiety, vivid & strange dreams, severe headaches, lashing out at loved ones, night sweats and diminished sex drive. Finally had enough and wanted off.  With doc's advice, was weaned to lower dosage of 37.5mg, then advised to take 1 XR every other day until the drugs were gone.  It's been 2 months and I've noticed fewer headaches and less blurred vision; slight increase in sex drive. But, I am dealing with increased anxiety and almost hypersenstive emotions - quick to anger; quick to cry.  Can't bear the idea of going back to drugs so I'm exploring other ways to deal with this.

I lost best friends, fell into the wrong croud, and fell totally behind in school. I grew up singing, dancing, and involved myself in art all my life until soon after I started taking the meddication. Coming off the meddication I did what my doctors told me to do, but during the intense withdrawl I tried to committ suicide three times - something totally out of character for me. I have stablized somewhat now, but I am still fell the both harsh physical and mental pain and frustration coming off of it. My doctor didn't think twice when she raised my dose after I became severly depressed and cut my arm open to such an extent I passed out from blood loss. I never felt that way before the medds. During this time I never thought something could do so much damage, and I trusted my doctors and parents. It's sad to think of myself naive when I decieded to finally try meddiction to help my at the time non-sucidal depression. My mom went on effexor to and I feel like I dont even know her any more. So far no one I have talked to believes me or cares to hear about the situation. This drug has piosoned my life, and it scares me that other people could have half the problems I did with it. For this drug to be put out on the market makes the world of XR even yet worse than it already does. This cover-up attempt at ""wellness"" is just another drug deal except now the government can claim their share half publicly. Drugs are not disapearing any time soon, but this is rediculous."

I have tried Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and Prozac but they just didn't do the trick.  Effexor XR has made me a new person with zero side effects.  I felt better from the first day I started the 37.5 dose and I'm now at 75. Along with ALL my symptoms being relieved, I have the added benifit of reduced hunger and carb cravings.  For the first time in a long time, I don't obsess over food, feel like I'm starving even though I just ate or only feel satisfied eating high carb things.  I sleep better and wake up refreshed.  I've never felt so normal and productive in my life!  I'm drinking more water, I'm more motivated which means more active and in 2 weeks, I've lost 7 pounds without much effort or depriving myself. I've read all the horror stories on the net and just thought this medicine needed some positive feedback.  Just because it gave you some horrible side effects doesn't mean it's bad.  It just means its not for you.  Please don't use scare tactics to keep someone from trying it as it could change their life they way it has mine.  I am aware of the withdrawal symptoms but because I feel so much better, I look forward to taking my pill in the morning so I don't miss a dose and I never plan on going off of it.

My anxiety attacks stopped almost immediately. I still get depressed, but only now usually before my monthly cycle which is common for women. I have more energy and way more patience. I too have the ""zaps"" when I miss a dose. The major downside for me to this med. is the weight gain. I've gained 17lbs in 3 mos. However I must admit my diet is not good so that probably has alot to do with it. I started out taking Celexa first, that helped a little with the depression but did nothing for the panic attacks. This drug has worked great for me. But keep in mind, everyone is different. What works for one may not work for another. I would also like to add its the combination of this med. and intensive counseling that has helped me. Just taking medication without getting to the root of your depression and/or anxiety attacks is just going to leave you going in circles."

I have definitely noticed a huge difference in my thinking.  I have suffered from mild depression since a young child but finally seeked medical help.  At the moment my mind wants to drift to negative, pesimistic thoughts I can literally feel Effexor perk me up.  Unfortunately, I am also beginning to feel the side effects.  For the past 2 days, I feel like I am extremely hungry one minute, and within a split second I'm nausious.  For the past 5 days, I have been experiencing dreams that range from weird to deathly scary.  Within 3 days of my first dosage, I could tell my sex drive was gone.  After reading the numerous comments (good and bad) about Effexor, I have decided to come off of it.  Luckily I haven't been using it for very long.  For anyone considering Effexor, I strongly suggest that you do your homework on this medication; and if you do decide to try it, promise yourself that you will not let a doctor tell you that you need more mg to fix the problem.  Trust yourself and listen to your body.

I'm the one who has to look into drug interactions and side-affects, they don't. Also, I found out you are not to mix it with Zyrtec because it increases somnolence.

It has worked wonders, but in the long-term I find that the side effects become overwhelming. I'm now maxed out at 300mg and have severe withdrawl symptoms every night. Because the med makes me a little hyperactive, I take it around 2:30am so that when it reaches full strength in my system it's time to wake up. The bummer about this schedule is that I have terrible nightmares and the worst night-sweats (soaking my sheets and pajama's) because of the withdrawl symptoms. If I miss a dose (god forbid!!) the withdrawls are crippling - headaches; shooting electricity type feelings originating from inside my skull and radiating out into my entire body; drastic mood swings; violent outbursts and uncontrolable anger; feeling unawake and groggy. This is just a partial list. I would like to taper off this medication, but I'm afraid of the withdrawls. Effexor has been great at treating my depression and helping me to take control. If anyone has successfuly gone off of effexor, I would appreciate any tips or advice you could share.

2727$Condition: Depression$4/19/2008 3:15:36 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I have been taking this drug for over two years now and am extremely satisfied with the way that it works for me. The withdrawl effects however are VERY hard to handle. I would caution anyone going on this drug about the withdrawl symptoms. My experience includes intense mood swings, very strange dreams, headaches, general depression symptoms, crying, lashing out at loved ones, violence to name a few. All of this on just missing one pill. I have also taken a couple of drug tests since being on Effexor and have NOT had a positive result for PCP or any other narcotics as reported from others. 
If you take this drug and need to take a Urine Analysis then disclose that you are taking the drug!  "

It keeps me functioning, and that's a big plus.  On the down side, withdrawal from Effexor is pretty tough- nausea and dark moods/anger- even if I miss one dose, it happens.  If you do taper, work with your doc, and GO SLOW!

2730$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/18/2008 12:06:04 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$3$5$"I have been taking 75 mg of Effexor for about a year and a half. I have loved everything about the medication. I have generalized anxiety disorder as well as social anxiety. I have had these symptoms my entire life but I started to have frequent panic attacks, so I started to take this medication. (I have tried several other prescriptions but this one worked wonders for me!) 
I now suffer less anxiety attacks, I have become more outgoing and less nervous in social situations and my mild depression has diminished. The down side to this was the fact that I have gain a significant amount of weight (25lbs) while taking Effexor and decided about two months ago that I wanted to try life without it. I have been having the worst withdrawals!! I started to take it every other day and would feel constantly slightly dizzy throughout the day. But I pushed through it and it is now IMPOSSIBLE to try and take it every three days. My body is physically addicted to this medication! I can not explain how awful the withdrawl symptoms are. My head feels fuzzy along with my vision, I have awful headaches and feel so dizzy it makes me extremely nauseous. I just lost my insurance and had to pay $150.00 for the prescription because I can't make it three days without taking it. This is a great medication but the symptoms and side effects are tough to deal with. "
2731$Condition: Depression$4/17/2008 6:05:08 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I switched from Zoloft to 75mg of Effexor XR about 6 months ago and I have been very happy with the results.  Insomnia is a problem however and I have to take Ambien CR to sleep and I have some mild sexual effects.  Headaches are a problem if I miss a dose.  In my opinion the benefits of this drug far outweigh the side effects.  My dose has just been increased to 150mg due to some mild loss of effectiveness at the lower dose, but given my current life circumstances this is not surprising.  Since starting Effexor I have lost the weight the Zoloft made me gain, I have less social anxiety, and I am able to deal with things MUCH better.  I am generally happier with life in general and I would recommend this medication.

Sadly, instead of getting relief, I ended up with what felt like a psychotic break. I had severe mood swings, moving between a complete lack of emotion and severe crying spells. I couldn't control my emotions, I couldn't make decisions, I ended up almost attempting suicide (my friend caught me). I ended up in the hospital because of this medicine. As soon as I stopped the medicine I started feeling better. By far the worst and scariest reaction I have ever had to a drug, and I have had lots of horrible ones.

I just thought I was just an emotional person. But when uncontrollable crying started to occur for no apparent reason, I sought help. It was effecting my job, my family, and my activity level. I found myself opting out of social engagements simply because I never knew when I would break into tears.
I've been taking 37.5 dosage of Effexor for 2 years. I was worried that I would be emotionally dead. But that hasn't occurred. I still find myself in unexplained emotional moments, but now I can get it under control. My family life, work life, and social life have dramatically improved. I'm no longer the introvert that I had become.
I do have very vivid dreams, but no problem sleeping. I did gain weight, so I increased the length of my daily walking routine and that helped. I have noticed less sex drive, but now that my husband and I recognize what's causing it, we're able to work through it with no problems. I do get hot flashes, but I'm learning how to deal with that, too. 
All in all, I'm a much happier, even-tempered person. It's a relief. Effexor is simply be a part of my life from now on."

Of my 81 years of age, I have been depressed for over half my life. I have been through all kinds of depression medication. So far I believe that effexor has helped me more than the others. Not wanting to be on medication, when I started feeling better I started cutting back on the dosage from 5 tablets of 75mg to 2 tablets of 75 mg. This was without my doctor's approval. While on a trip, I ran out of medication for about 3 days. I went into a deep depression which I describe as a living hell. After I saw my doctor, and he chewed my ass out for cutting back on the medicatin without his knowledge, he thought I would be on the maximum amount and dossage the rest of my life.Rather than going back down into that deep dark valley,although I dont feel that I am complety over my depression, I wil stay with his recommendations.
2759$Condition: Depression$4/9/2008 6:57:16 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$3$"I have had depression for as long as I can remember and was diagnosed with it early in my adult life. I had been through prozac, which I loved at first, but after a few years lost its effectiveness. Apparently antidepressants do that after prolonged use. I have been thought Zoloft, Wellbutrin and I think Cymbalta, I'm not real sure about Cymbalta.
Anyhow, the Effexor has been working, I'm actually taking its generic version Veneflexine (I think that's how it's spelled)  It was slow to work at first and I think my Dr got a little crazy with the dosages as he had me taking 5 pills a day. Although I convinced him I could get by with less and I'm taking 300 mg, or 3 a day. It's somewhat inconvenient in that I take 2 in the morning and 1 at night, but aside from that I have been happy with it. No real side effects, possibly insomnia, but I've had that before I started taking it.
I just know what I was like before I started taking it, and what I'm like now and it does work. I never really had a major problem with anxiety, perhaps once very rarely usually situational in cause, however I can't say that I've experienced in anxiety since I've taken it, but then again haven't had much situations to cause it either....whew!
I personally would give the medication a thumbs up.  It does work, however everyone's wired slightly different. So if it doesn't work, don't give up on your treatment. There are a lot of medications out there, and keep searching until you find the right one, it will definitely make life worth living again."

I'm not sure if my anxiety causes my depression or the other way around. But I've been dealing with both for many years. I began Effexor XR at the lowest dosage, then increased to 75. Used that dosage for a year. Just recently increased to 150. The reason I tried the increase was because of anxiety. At 75, it helped with most of my depression symptoms. However, I still needed to sometimes take Ativan for anxiety attacks. At 150, Effexor seems to be helping with my anxiety problems as well. I would not take drugs for mental health unless my situation was serious. I have two children, marriage and a full-time job.  With help, I can handle it all.

2777$Condition: Depression$3/30/2008 2:17:37 PM$Reviewer: Dwayne, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"For about 3-4 years I was on 225mg a day then it started not to work as well then I started to not care if I lived or died, very lethargic,apathetic about everything and unable to function working (basically the same as before I was taking the meds).  I am now on 300mgs Efexor and 300mgs of Wellbutrin a day and am ok again. However, with the increased meds I do suffer with some ED and lack of sexual desire and some lack of overall emotions.  So beware at about 3 to 5 years as you may need an increase in dosage(not just me, read through the reviews and you will see). The ""great"" thing about efexor if I miss a dosage after about 4 hours extreme headaches and dizziness remind me to take it. I do not look forward to the day I ever try to get off this med, as just taking a pill late can give me such a killer headache, and taking the dose does not immediately take it away. So even if the drug works well for a long time, keep an eye on yourself as you may need an increase later on!  "

In the past three years on Effexor XR I have experienced a steady improvement in my relationships with my family and the people I work with, both clients and staff. The greatest change has been in the last year. I am excited by the world and nature and people for the first time in my life. I have finally found something that works.

I called my ins. co. and complained to 8 people over a period of 6 weeks, before I could speak to a supervisor.
I will not tke a drug made in a foreign country in light of what has just happened with heprin. As a result of taking the generic,I felt like I was leaving my body physically and mentally. The generic form of Effexor just about did me in, as I was told I had to tke 150 mg.of it to get the same benefits of the brand. I was also  told that paroxitine was a generic for Effexor. I worked in the health care industry for over forty years and know better.How sad that we have people deciding what meds our ins. will pay for who have no more drug education than this.Because I still work, I do not qualify for a $0 copay and because my ins. will not pay for the brand. The brand Effexor was on the formulary at the beginning of 2008, but disappeared a week after I tried to fill my Rx. I guess i grew up in a time when peoples lives had some meaning and money wasn't the priority.

I have experienced EXTREMELY HORRIBLE side affects. My brain feels like I have an electrical shortage (7 days--continuously). My family is falling apart because they CANNOT help me. I hurt all over--from head to toe. These ""jolts"" in my brain make me feel awful, which naturally alters my mood because there is NOTHING that can be done to take this away! Not to mention that after I started taking Effexor XR several years ago, it decreased my sex drive; resulting in difficulty having an orgasm (something I did not have a problem with before taking Effexor)!  I have no desire for sex, even though I find my husband so very sexy! Additionally, I struggle with constipation; have abnormal dreams; weight loss was great (at the beginning) but not withstanding; my cholesterol and blood pressure have been up and down like my weight; and I forget a lot details and dates (something that is not conducive to my family or profession). There are times I feel like in my effort to try to minimize my anxiety, I developed something much worse—an Effexor XR addiction!  If you plan to stop taking Effexor XR abruptly, I strongly urge you to consider the side affects (withdrawal symptoms) with your doctor. I do not know how long this will last, but I am fighting it--barely. I feel completely helpless against these symptoms, and I do not ever want to go through this again."

It seemed like after a few years that it wasn't working as effectively with my monthly PMS,too.  The doctors asked me if I wanted to increase the dosage(sure glad I didn't).  Now five years later, I want to discontinue taking Effexor and I feel horrible.  I have been decreasing the dosage as my doctor instructed and only stopped taking it all together for five days and feel HORRIBLE.  I have all the symptoms that everyone else describes.  It is really sad to hear that one writer says he/she feels the withdrawal symptoms still have 6 months.  I wish I had known about the terrible withdrawl symptoms when I first started taking it.  I would have reconsidered.  I would definitely tell anyone out there to try other anti-depressants before taking this drug.  My doctor is putting me back on the low dose 37.5 mg because of my symptoms.  I am determined to get off this drug sooner or later.  I think I will try the antioxidants that other writers have been talking about and perhaps suggest to my doctor to take Prozac.

Caused high blood presure and increase in weight, total suppression of any sex drive, impotence. benefits did not last and extreme discontinuation symptoms when trying to stop even though tapered off over several months and finally replaced with prozac which was then tappered off as well. withdrawal symptoms persist still after 6 months of not taking effexor. one dose of prozac or effexor removes symptoms immediately so not a recurrance of original problem. i Would only recommend using effexor as a last resort it is virtually impossible to stop taking it once you start. Withdrawal efects i have had are worse than original problem. I now have severe confusion, mania, violent outbursts and physical manifestations include dizzyness , trembling limbs, sweats, stomach problems. The original depression is still present and the anxiety is if anything worse. however i have been on virtually all the different types of medications in the past 30 years and effexor was the firt to make a difference, but at what a price?!.

Terrible whirling feeling.  I have taken this for 7 years.  This is the second time I've tried to get off this drug.  1st time the doctor and I assumed that I just wasn't ready and the symptoms were the depression.  This past month I am going to get off the medication come hell or high water.   Enough is enough.  I feel terrible, have gained 50 lbs since I started it, problems with blood pressure and I see someone is having issues with liver.  Bingo, so am I.  Don't know quiet yet, I am being tested.
I feel like hell right now.  Body aches, ringing in ears, whirling ,felling like crying, bolting,  almost like a flu, muscles hurt.   But have reading all these reactions, I am going to give it all I have to get off of this stuff.   Aren't the drug companies at fault for this kind of problem.  I was not told, read, heard anything that this was a possibility.   I would have tried something else for the depression.  I glad to see that I'm not alone, but also sorry to hear so many are having the same problem.  I tried to tell my doctor that I read how difficult it was to get off this, but she said, yes you can.   I didn't think to ask, at what expense.   On the flip side, if she didn't give a positive attitude you might wallow in that idea.   All in all, this stinks.   I feel like hell and hoping that I'll make it out of this drug.
All the best to those who are trying as well.

Words are completely lost to me at times...I know the word I want to use is somewhere in my brain, but can't come up with it.  I mix up words, forget names, can't remember where I put things.  Sense of time also seems ""off"".  Something that happened yesterday can feel like years ago and vice versa.  More tired now than ever.  I could sleep most of the day.  In general my mood is much improved, but sometimes I feel like I'm loosing my mind.  My husband says I've improved incredibly on Effexor, so I guess I'm staying on it.

I can't function, I can't think, I feel dizzy, hot flashes, headaches and I pretty much just feel like I'm going crazy. I felt better being depressed. I have a whole new respect for drug addicts. If detox is anything like this, no wonder the relapse rate is so high."

I did not feel emotionally numb which I have experienced with other drugs.  I did have some trouble sleeping at first.

I live my days very calm now, and my relationships don't suffer anymore. I can't imagine going back to those extreme highs and lows.  The only thing I worry about are the long term effects - I would eventually like to trial a 'natural' solution, but for now I won't risk the contentment.

I am now taking some OTC items which are helping tremendously. I saw that some people trying to escape the Effexor demon were taking fish oil supplements and multivitamin/minerals, so I'm now taking Organic Flaxseed Oil and a Mega Vitamin/Mineral Complex with an additional boost of B-Complex Vitamins which I purchase cheaply with very low shipping costs from http://www.VitaCost.com. Some treatment programs are stating that with the depletion of antioxidants, one needs to add a product such as gluathione supplementation. This is also available from VitaCost very cheaply. I've added another super antioxidant, Acai pure freeze-dried pure organic powder from Amazon Thunder, the provider of Acai for the Oprah Show documentary. I take my scoopful daily in juice, but some people like it in applesauce, yogurt, etc. It has no sugar added and is completely organic. It's available from http://www.amazonthunder.com/members/coonmartranc h. I've been using these dietary boosters during the entire time and will continue to do so for several months after I'm completely off the Effexor as my withdrawal symptoms have been minimal. Let me know if this suggestion helps or not. Best wishes.........

It's amazing what it has done for me in terms of treating the depression. I've been on it for almost 6 years now. The thing I absolutely HATE about it is that my body is physiologically dependent on it. Like other users, if I don't take it within a 36 hour window, I begin to experience terrible withdrawl symptoms. It feels like a really bad flu. There is dizziness, nausea, and aches/pains. I really don't like the fact that I've become dependent on the drug.

I would feel like I had a hangover which would keep me from taking the dose even longer since I was vomiting. This is a very bad trip...I had to decrease dosage and switch to another drug to get away from the misery. I am now dealing with things but at least I'm not tied down to a medication that can mess up your life that quickly. Good luck to thoughs that decide it's time to get off it:)

I have had suicidal feelings, frequent crying spells, so tired, anxiety worse, affraid to make decisions, paranoid, burden on my family and a constant feeling of despair and hopelessness.

I was given a heavy dose 300 mg/day. On it for ~18 months. Started to reduce the dosage and what I call 'neurochemelectrical discharges' started zapping my brain. It was tolerable and expected. Kept reducing the dosage slowly as directed. Finally made it down to 37.5mg/1x day and the 'neurochemeletrical' circus was raging...but slightly tolerable. Went totally off and felt like I was back in college having the worst psychadelic experience of my life. Called the Dr. and picked up two more titration packets with the 37.5s and eased them back in and then started staggering them every other day and longer. My brain finally settled down a little. I was ready to stop again, and did so. I was still seeing (and mostly feeling...tracers) but they were tolerable. I was off for 8 days...yes 8 (eight, 7+1, etc.) so it was out of my system but the psychadelic party was still going. I broke down and took a 75mg capsule I had...just in case... Bottom line. THIS STUFF IS REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET OFF OF! Please consider this if your Dr. suggests it. Believe me, I know how bad things may seem, but please consider all options. I now have to start the original (or generic) Effexor at 25 mg for 7 days and then split them to 12.5 mg for 7 days. I am pretty tough (now anyway...) by most standards but this (withdrawl) is, in my opinion, worse than depression. I know how to take care of that now without meds. Just please look into it before getting on it.

It did a great job of preventing the migraines (only one in 6 months compared to 3-4 a month before I started taking it.) However, I put on 20 pounds since I started taking it.  I am not a tall person, so the weight gain really shows and REALLY bothered me.  So, I decided to go off of it.  I went off cold turkey 3 days ago and WOW what a surprise. I have been having estremely severe mood swings (not good when you have 3 children under the age of 6), crying at the drop of a hat, and a weird buzzing in my head.  I thought I was having a nervous breakdown - I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.  This whole episode has scared me (and my husband.)  I just now have read all of the posts regarding withdrawal symptoms and am so thankful that they are there and that everyone has shared their stories;  now I know that there is a reason that I am acting so irrational.  I just hope the withdrawal symptoms end soon. 
2932$Condition: Depression$2/10/2008 9:25:14 PM$Reviewer: $3$3$3$I have been taking this medication for about four years now. While taking the medication, I have had the dosage adjusted several times. The most prevalent side effect for me was hot flashes and weight gain. Under medical supervision, I tried to decrease the dosage of the medication in an attempt to ultimately stop taking it. Yet, as the dosage was decreased I found myself becoming more depressed and even suicidal. Therefore, I had to increase the dosage again. I feel that this medication has contributed to my hypersomnia. However, my doctor disagrees. I will continue to seek a change in my medication. Yet, I will continue to take this medication for the time being. I take three 75 mg tabs once a day.

I now am on Zanax just to help me get through the day. I cant sleep. Oh and did I mention once again, the brain zaps. These things are just unreal. They are happening about 15-20 times in one single minute. Its aweful. I really would love to know when this is gonna quit. I want everyone to know I really wish I would have checked the med out 1st or at least got on here to read about getting off the medicine.  I have to say this is one of the worst things I have ever gone through in my life. It makes you wanna cry because I dont know if I will ever be normal again. Ive asked the drs and the pharmacist about these brain zaps and they say they dont know what Im talking about. PLease someone tell me if they truely end and when. Or if theres any relief from them.

I am weaning off the Klonopin now, because the XR has been really effective.  I have not experienced sexual side effects or weight gain on this drug - the only noticable side effect I've had is dry mouth - and that just makes me drink more water, which is good for you anyway.  

The best thing I've done besides the medication for anxiety is quitting the caffeine entirely.  If you have any kind of panic or anxiety disorder, this is probably the best thing you can do for yourself after getting medical help!  And even though I am not very ""new agey"", I've taken up Kundalini Yoga, which focuses primarily on breathing (good for when you're feeling anxious) and Hatha Yoga (which is great for relieving stress).  Try it, you'll like it! 

While I was happy with the zoloft besides being a bit flighty, this just goes to show that if the first drug you try doesn't work, there are others to try - don't give up!  Be honest with your doctor, and you WILL find something that helps you!"

It completely changed my life.  Don't obsess about little stuff anymore, I feel more alive and in tune that I have in a very long time. Dry mouth side effect is a small price to pay.  Helps my peri-menoupasal symptoms also very much. I sleep very well. I can tell when I've missed a pill.  I tried Zoloft and Celexa before being put on this and neither had the effect the effexor has. To those who have been on depression anxiety medication that hasn't help, ask your Dr. to switch you, it's worth trying more than one kind.  It's been a godsend for me.

He started the medication after he became depressed, paranoid, accusatory, started having panic attacks in social situations. He went from being very irritable, and untrusting to a sweet, thoughtful, animated person. It worked so well for him, when I had a bad day or pms, he would jokingly offer to share it with me. I liked the results it gave him. He did not have the problems that others have described when getting off the medication. He weaned off it over about 2-3 weeks and had no adverse effects. The important thing about these types of medication is to be open and honest with your doctor about how you feel. It will do you no good to hide your embarrasing symptoms, like decreased sex drive or mood swings or crying from your doctor. Sometimes these things are hard to talk about, but that is why you are paying him for his opinion.

After a little over a year of taking it at a dose of 112.5, it stopped working.  I refuse to increase it due to what I've understood to be withdrawal effects. I'm on a schedule to discontinue, and I'm a bit worried.  No problems yet. But the flashes are back with a vengence, whether or not I take it.  I did notice weight gain, too, which I hope will remit once I'm off of it completely.

At first I took it at the 37.5 dose then I went to the 75 dosage and I could not handle the nausea, intense tightening of the neck, constipation, lack of appitite, sleepiness and vertigo. I have to take this medicine mid morning so that the ""Yarning Effect"" will not start until I get home.  I asked my doctor to just take be down to 37.5 and that has seemed to help.   I take this drug for PMDD.  My husband says that I am sweet otherwise but during this time I am really upset over small things and at times have very very negative thoughts.  I have read the side effects and read the comments prior to my taking the Effexor XR.  I now take the medicine every other day or as needed.  I know that it is supposed to be taken daily but if I take it daily even in the small dosages, I have Vertigo after about a week and have little emotion at all. When trying to go to a smaller dosage after about a week or 2 on the 75 dosage, I felt a bad shocking sensation in my head. This was alarming but I was glad to know that I was not the only one.  The medicine does help me with my over all mood and I don't get as anxious or concern about things as much as I used to.  I may be able to take this medicine like this due to the fact that I am a petite woman, I am not sure. I hope that the medicine works for you.  "

Yes, it helped with libido, sex drive, very high energy.  I realized that over time my hours of sleep were decreasing, especially after the birth of my little one.  My moods were swinging way outer limits, I obsessed about huge global, national, and biblical superstorms.  I know that sounds crazy, and I was.  I checked myself into a mental unit at a local hospital two months after 9/11/2001.  I have seen several psychiatrists, I have been diagnosed with BPD.  I've had three episodes all while taking EffexorXR, which put me inpatient again.  I have now found a wonderful university hospital in the state I live in, the residents are brilliant.  I no longer am a victim to Effexor.  I'm  happy for those who have found solace with Effexor, but feel also heart-broken for those who have suffered its horrible long term usage, and the process to get off of it. Thank you for reading this, peace be upon you.

The only real effect I had from it was suicidal ideation! I was sent to a Psychiatrist who specializes in drug usage. He wanted me off the EffexorXR, but insisted I would have to spend 3-4 weeks in a psych ward to detox. I refused to go any place where I would be locked in, so he prescribed Wellbutrin along with the EffexorXR. I have multiple diseases, and daily take some 15 different drugs, including opiates for pain. I have been seeing this man for almost 5 years quarterly for scripts for a controlled med. I wanted off the Effexor, I beleived it was causing the Weight Loss,(130 lbs to 89lbs) Drooling, Hallucinations
and Nausea. He finally, after getting to know me, gave me a plan to teeter off the drug. I have been free of the capsules for 12 weeks, the first three weeks I barely remember. I am so glad to be off, my memory is better, and cognation is coming back!

Overall I really have really liked this medication. It has had an impact on my life. I had social anxiety disorder as well as depression. Both of them were cleared up for a long time. 

Unfortunately, I burned out at my job last year and have ended up in the hospital for depression. I don't really want to say that my medication didn't work because I think I really caused my burnout (working 80+ hours/week, volunteering, etc.) My doctor bumped up my dosage from 150 to 225 and that seems to have helped me (along with a lot of therapy). Sometimes I am concerned though that maybe it is losing its effect on me. I hope not... I am not sure what I would change to. 

It was sort of rough in the beginning of taking this medication - I was hyper and it was harder to sleep. Those effects wore off after a couple of months. 

Now my side effects seem to include night sweats (sometimes the sheets are wet), weight gain (some, but it could just be that I am getting older), and my orgasms are different (its like I feel them through a filter). If I miss taking it for a few hours I feel vertigo and sort of out of body. Miss two days and I just quit moving. It sucks. I try to avoid that at all costs now :)

Overall I am pleased with this medication. I was on Paxil before and all I felt like doing was stare at the wall.

Before the small things would upset me and I would be very anxious and upset.  Now I feel like I am more on an even keel and don't get upset and anxious anymore.

I like effexor because I had no side effects and it seemed to work well.  I felt a bit numb and still have some trouble concentrating and cannot hold extreme emotions for very long, but I think this drug is effective.  The negative is that the withdrawal symptoms SUCK.  Unfortunately this drug does not 'build up' in the system, so after 24 hours, you will definitely feel the missed dose.  I am miserable and won't even drive when I feel that way.  The worst part is that it makes me sleep, and not really wake up.  I've missed work, classes, etc.  If you are forgetful or cannot remember to take meds daily (missing more than 3 days a month), or even a little undisciplined (like me) I'd say don't do Effexor XR.  Once you take the missed dose, though, it kicks in a few hours later.  I'm looking to switch again, as I feel it does not work nearly as good as at the beginning of treatment (2+ years ago)."

As soon as I start taking it again, it goes away almost immediately.  I don't think I'll ever be able to stop taking it, and that scares me worse than depression.

It took quite a while to understand how it effected my body, and the proper times to take it, so that its side effects fit my schedule.  To avoid being tired, I started taking the medication at 5:00 AM (150mg) so that I could sleep for an hour after taking it, thereby avoiding the exhausted feeling mid-morning.  I take my other dose (150mg) at 10:00 PM, or right before bed.  IMPORTANT - Do not stop taking this medicine ""cold turkey"" and definitely talk to your doctor before you change the dosage.  Contrary to early studies, this drug has addictive properties that manifest themselves in the form of EXTREME vertigo.  I ran out of medicine for two days, by the morning of the third day, I could barely walk without weaving and bumping into things.  The emergency room doctor told me this was due to my abrupt change in dosage, and after a day of taking my medicine, I was fine."

Initially I experienced benefits from the medication, but eventually these benefits were replaced by negative side-effecs which crippled me.  I gradually discontinued the Zoloft (against medical advice) and my health improved dramatically!  I continued to take the Effexor, although the therapeutic benefits diminished and I was plagued with dark, destructive and suicidal thoughts.  I decided to wean myself off of the Effexor (against doctor's advice again).  It took me about 2 months gradually reducing the dosage (sometimes increasing it again when withdrawal symptoms occurred).  Today I use only diazepam (5mg x 3) to control anxiety and panic.  My experience with prescription antidepressants is that the initial benefits diminish over time to be replaced by negative side-effects.  Effexor may be a good short-term therapy, but over time the side-effects increased and the benefits disappeared.  Diazepam in the only prescription that has provided consistent, continuous and effective treatment.

For someone with a history of 3 separate depressive episodes, Effexor has increased my energy, decreased my appetite, made me less agitated, improved my mood and did not adversely affect my libido. All in all, I highly recommend this psychotropic!

If you start, be prepared to stay on it for life.  I got down to a bare minimum but if I cut it clear out got very sick.  Noise in ears and hurt when I turned my eyes even.  I finally upped the dose when I had a bad time and I'm back up on the higher dose again now.

It works very well, however, after taking it for so long I am starting to get very undesirable side effects - constant sweating, sore mouth with tongue getting cracks in it, like it was cut with a knife.  Thes side effects are bad enough that I wanted to stop taking Effexor.  I did for a while and replaced it with Wellbutrin, but that only helped with the depression.  It didn't help my headaches.  They came back.  

I need more serotonin to take care of the headaches."
3142$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$12/20/2007 9:15:49 AM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$"This medicine is Awful.  Been using about 7 months and suddenly I have been itching all over.  Made my blood pressure go up, so now I am on 3 different meds instead of 2.  Someone should be shot for making such a med.  My research shows that itching is a common side effect of this med. AND they say that it is not addicting, well explain to me why I have to be tapered off slowly.  I was taking 225 mg per day and for the last couple day down to 150mg.  Nausea, dizzy, etc. They also had me on Risperdal at bedtime, so I am going through withdrawals from that also.  If I ever get off this med.....no more for me.  Doctors should take it for a few months and then try to go off to experience the side affects.  I have had BAD headaches every since I started this stupid med.  I just pray to God that I can get off this med and stay off.  If you are going through similar side effects, I feel for you and understand.  Oh, by the way, I was on .25 of risperdal and they took me off cold turkey.  How can the FDA approve such mean drugs?!?!  I hope if you are trying to decide whether to take this drug or not, you do some serious research before deciding unlike me.  Now I am among the thousands of others who are trying to get off this and have a normal life.  Friends say ""quit scratching"" but you cannot quit.  I am taking benadryl to try to help with the itching.  Search effexor and itching on the net and see what you find.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!  Good luck to all who are going through what I am and may God bles you all."

I didn't notice a change until about month after I started effexor. Then it had gotten rid of my angry outburts and given me patience, which dramatically changed my relationships with many in a positive way. But lately I've noticed many changes. I sleep alot and am extremely fatigued. I am numb & emotionless. I have lost all  motivation in daily life . Constipation. Lessened sexual desire. And I too feel the ""brain jitters"" but mostly when something happens that would usually make me upset and cause the angery outbursts. When I have them it makes me feel like a freak who isn't being myself! I would love to get off the medication but am very scared to experience the side effects to the fullest effect. I have missed up to 4days of doses at once and felt horrible. Lots of sharp pained headaches! I do believe that this drug is intended for a lifetime of use.

At the higher dose I started feeling emotionally numb (I'd recognize I _should_ be sad, but I wouldn't feel it), I'd sweat a lot (very weird), I had crazy dreams, and generally I just felt...weird.  At 150 mg, though, I have regular emotions, and I still get sad sometimes, but it's ""normal"" sad, emotions that I should be feeling.  It keeps me much more level and really functional.

I recommend Effexor as it really does help you even things out and you are able to become the person you're meant to be, without all the depression, anger, and anxiety that a chemical imbalance can cause.

I tried going off the 75mg of Effexor XR slowly by taking 37.5 for 2 weeks(under my doctors supervision) and I literally thought I was going to end up in the hospital because I was vomiting, sweating, shaking and in excruciating pain for days. Unfortunatly I feel like I am going to be stuck on this medication for the rest of my life because the withdrawl is more than I can bare. I ended up going right back on the 75mg a day because nothing I did made me feel better once the drug was out of my system. I give the drug credit for its effectiveness in treating depression especially if you have tried other drugs and nothing has worked, but this is more of a long term treatment rather than a quick fix.

I continued with the tretment thinking I was being a wimp, well the nausea somewhat subsided and the headaches, but then the uncontrollable sweating started. I was soaking wet all day and with this medication in combination with Dexadrine for ADD I actually felt numbness in my lips and chest pain one morning on the way to work.  Heart attack? Who knows...It scared the bejeebers out of me though, I went back to the Celexa again and remain on it currently with again the same weight gain issues.  It is a bum deal for those of us who are fighting depression, to know that you are going to gain weight which being a female, we all know it is hard enough everyday of our lives to try to maintain a healthy weight.

With Effexor, it is VERY IMPORTANT to continue taking the medication. The withdrawal is terrible!!! One a few occasions for one reason or another I've found myself without my pills for a few days and it was awful. The withdrawal symptoms start within 48 hours and it's so hard to describe. To borrow from another reviewer...It's like your life is a slow motion movie. I start to get a little paranoid and VERY panicky. I am a little nervous about ever going off this medicine because of that. When I go off my pills, I feel completely out of it.

It did nothing for my depression, caused me to gain over 40lbs (which I had just recently lost), caused extreme diarrhea and vomitting, and made me emotionless.  My fiance and I split up because I felt nothing.  I was literally numb of emotions.  I couldn't laugh or cry.  I wasn't happy or sad.  I was just there.  I absolutely hated this drug.  I switched to this from Wellburtin because of Wellbutrin's side-effects, but the side-effects of Effexor were much worse and not worth the switch.  I'm back on Wellbutrin, and have my life back under control.  No more crazy thoughts, diarrhea, vomitting, or numbness.  Effexor works for some, but is definitely not for all.

One thing i am worried about, is ever trying to get off this med. I have heard the withdrawal symptoms are insane. I have experienced wierd effects if I skip a dose; i.e. nausea, sensations in my brain (hard to explain), and the anxiety returns.

I have not experienced any sexual side effects, and my appetite has not increased or decreased, just stayed steady and I have in fact lost weight with this med. I am moving up to 225mg, just to try and make it so I don't have ""bad days"" as often as I do now, which is about once a week. I used to take lexapro and with that I didn't want to have sex ever and gained weight like crazy.

I have agoraphobia, which is a fear of open spaces, basically anywhere that is not my house, and with this it made it a little better, but nothing compared to the effexor xr. I am on 150mg before bed, and when i take it before bed, I can't sleep, so it was switched to the morning. Now that I take it in the morning, I have a regular sleep schedule, not so much a loss of appetite, but a steady one, and I have actually lost weight. My sex life is great, and has not been effected like it was when I was on the lexapro. With the effexor xr, I can leave my house to attend school, I'm a senior in college, and attending class is much easier, also grocery shopping is a breeze too. Overall, I am happy with my results, but it is being increased to 225mg a day to try and fix it more, since I do occasionally have bad mornings where I do not want to go outside.

I am trying to be patient so that I can have relief from depression, and not worry about what the drug is doing to me. It affects EVERYONE DIFFERENTLY so please don't be scared of what others report about THEIR side effects. If you find it doesn't help keep your mood steady and positive, try something else like adding therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy to your 'arsenal of support'  Do not go off effexor cold turkey, this is stated everywhere and many people ignore this warning, which causes problems. Warnings and directions are there for a reason and following the instructions can help you to have a more positive, healthy experience with anti-depressants. I hope this has been helpful for those of you considering effexor for depression/anxiety or whatever it may be for you, and know that ANY step toward getting help for yourself is a good one!! also, congrats for educating yourself first!  good luck everyone.

I hope and pray it doesnt last to much longer because I dont know how much longer I can take it.

I take 150mg Effexor with breakfast and I also take 20mg Adderall tablets 2X/day, once with breakfast and one with lunch.  The Effexor by itself does an excellent job for me with depression, anxiety and nervousness.  I do, however get extremely sleepy when using it alone.  So the Dr. prescribed the Adderall to offset this by keeping me alert during the day and also to help me focus.  I don't have any side effects whatsoever except I am a little bit numbed or non-emotional, this may just be due to being so anxious for so many years.  I would give anything to be able to go back to my childhood and had these medicines then.

I wish I had taken it years earlier, because I have been dysthymic for most of my life (60). After I had BC, was on Tamoxifen, and other major life changes, I went from ""not happy"" to not  wanting to ""do"" tomorrow - not suicidal, but significantly different ... tired.It's gotten me out of the pit. For the past couple of years I have also taken Adderall for ADHD.  This threesome seems to work.  How long will I have to take it?  Who knows? The alternative sucks. I may yet try reducing the dosage, because all these chemicals can't be all that great for my liver. I'm just glad I found a doctor who was willing (and able - a PhD (Biochemistry) along with the MD) to try different combinations until we found one that would work. Once I went through a period of missing dosages here and there that must have mounted up.  I can miss 150mg of my total 375mg/day without ill effects - more than that is too great a drop at once. Coming off the drug is not pleasant, I hear, but it is doable and takes a l-o-n-g time. Have to be patient."

Worked okay but I was never professionally diagnosed  with anxiety/depression before i started taking effexor. I was probably considered average by most professionals regarding levels of anxiety.  My family doctor put me on this med after I told her I get anxious at times and I wish i could go back in time and stopped myself from taking a brain altering med that my family doctor prescribed.  Not only was the weight gain horrible but the loss in sex drive drove me insane.  I finally decided to go off but the withdrawal was so horrible, i considered going back on this drug.  I had the usual side effects, brain zaps, etc.  But the emotional withdrawal symptoms is what is so devasting. I find myself crying and screaming when i'm alone and I have never ever had this problem pre-drug.  Please please, don't take this drug unless a trained counselor or doctor prescribes this and after much evaluation, finds this to be the correct route.  Family doctors aren't trained to see the signs of depression and anxiety.  My life is an absolute mess now and hopefully once all of the drug is out of me, i can lead a normal life.

However, like many others, I experience severe withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose. I've tried to get off it to start another drug and have been unable to do so. I was up to 450 mgs whereas my father only took 75 mgs and did not have trouble getting off the drug when it was time. I experience nausea, ""brain shivers"", crying and severe depression when I miss more than one dose. Also cannot have an orgasm (or a very weak one anyway). Think seriously and discuss thoroughly with your doctor before starting this drug. I had tried nineteen different combinations of drugs before I started taking Effexor XR. Exhaust other possibilities first. I'm afraid that I'm going to be on this drug forever, whether I need to be or not. I'm not certain that it's been worth it."

When it seems like it isn't working anymore, increase your dose. After 5 years, I am having a problem with it working for me, so my doctor is now adding to it. Also, try Vitamin B's, which really helps too. I have experienced a change in the meds when I have to take antibiotics, and have seen my molar teeth crumble.

I was taking Xanax at the same time. I had to stop taking Effexor as it caused central nervous system depression, which if you take this type of combination long enough it can be fatal from my research. I stopped the drug after two days. Symptoms of central nervous system depression include: extreme drowsiness, losing your balance, pains in the back of your head, extreme mobility problems, extreme state of confusion.The only anti-depressants I would recommend based on my own experience to be used with any of the benzodiazepines(xanax,klonopin,ativan,librium,etc .) would be Zoloft or Remeron(mirtazapine).

Both situational and chemical. Effexor has been best for overall effectiveness, but I still have some difficulty with depression. Some help is better than none and my alternative is a disabling depression during which I am unable to even get out of bed through the day. My Effexor treatment is supplemented with low dose Dexadrine. This is closely monitored by my MD. The help of Dexadrine is an often overlooked or underprescribed medication because of the unnecessarily fearful connection of the ""speed"" phenomenon - this is from a complete lack of education on the part of the MD as regards the usefulness of this medication, at proper times, to supplement the fatigue that can accompany depression."

It seems to be relatively effective. I have full medical insurance, yet the cost to fill my Effexxor has never been less than $97.00. Personally, I find that overly expensive. Most importantly, I'd caution any and everyone considering taking Effexxor to research its side effects beforehand. Personally, I found the side effects to be nothing short of nightmarish. I 'm very regimented about taking my Effexxor every day at roughly the same time everyday. On the rare occassion that I missed a dose, let's say on a Tuesday morning; by Wednesday morning & CERTAINLY by Wednesday evening, I am completely nauseous, my equilibrium is totally off kilter, my pupils begin to dilate, then decrease down to the size of a ""pin dot"", and alternate back & forth until I am able to take my next dose. I become extremely dizzy, and was literally afraid to drive my car. The side effects are so fierce, that I have only missed a dose perhaps 3 times in 5 years. Even then, it was a result of me unexpectedly having to stay overnight out of town on business - or some other extinuating circumstance. I don't mean to be disparaging, I'm simply an advocate of self education re: psychotherapeutic meds because every person reacts differently to any drug & often times, physicians can't quite fathom the toll certain aspects of certain drugs have on our personal health and lifestyle."

My PCP put me on this right before I left home for college.  She thought the stress I was going through was related to depression but the fact was I was scared to move 15 hours away to go to school.  I was on this medication for 2 years and if I missed a single dose, I would feel the withdrawal symptoms immediately.  I would have trouble walking, very unsteady (like I was 80 years old), extreme sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, weakness, tired all the time.  When I tried to stop taking the medication, I couldn't go more than 2 days even with 37.5 mg.  Finally, I just had to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and laid on a couch for a whole week until I was completely detoxed.  It was the worst experience of my life...and the medicine did nothing to help my ""depression"".  RESEARCH everything before you start taking something that you know nothing about.

In fact, it heightened it.  When i drank a mixed drink, i became an angry drunk.  I attribute the increased angriness to this drug because i haven't had a problem since i've been off it.  There is a reason why it says not to drink alcohol while taking this med.  If thats a problem for you, then i would do some additional research.  also, the weight gain was awful.  I gained 20lbs in 3 months.  I'm usually very petite and this was such a tramautizing event for me that i became more depressed.  
Overrall, just do research before this is prescribed to you.  My midwife, who has no mental health training, gave this to me. I find this absolutely irresponsible.  It ruined my life for two years and since i've been off, i feel like my old self.  "

If I do not take this medication EXACTLY 24 hours every day, immediately I start getting withdrawl symtoms. Being a recovered drug addict, I know it is much like a withdrawl from heroin. 1st is the migraines. Then the sweating, bones hurting, vomiting, diareah, it's horrible. But, that's how I never miss a dose. The more extreme symptoms I wrote about do not happen until the 1st full 24 hours without the medicine. But, nonetheless, I've been free from depression for 4 years now, and clean and sober for the same amount of time. i would recommend this product only if you plan to be on it for a LONG period of time, as you can tell what it will be like to try to get off of it.

Any upset became fly off the handle blind anger.  This med stopped the derailment, totally and completely.  And immediately.  I still get angry, but it doesn't overtake me anymore.  I wish I could recapture the first two weeks on 39.5 mg; absolute contentment.  Doubling that did not much of anything; doubling it again (today) has been nice, but I still deal with being me.  I was afraid of meds like this; felt if I couldn't do it myself, I was weak and worthless.  Lemme tell ya, this med has made me ME again, to where I can interact with the world again instead of evading because I fear yet another inappropriate outburst.  I do like yakking with people; I am no longer sullen, which prevented that.  On the job, instead of finding fault with everything and anything, I've recaptured the joy in my ability to do what I do.  One idiot I work with, instead of being a source of bristling irritation, is just an idiot, period.  I still get angry and experience frustration; I'm still me.  But I don't find myself wanting to grab a baseball bat and knock some sense into people's heads anymore.  This med did not work for my biological daughter.  Can't judge meds like this that way.  But she did say it was nasty to get off of.  Weird positive side effect I've noticed:  when first taking, and at each dosage increase, my breathing is easier (I have asthma).  All in all, the positive of this med (no longer itching to jump out of my skin and whack somebody) is well worth it.  I watch the ceiling at night with each dose increase; when I do sleep, dreams are clearly remembered.  I am well pleased with this medication.  Me, who resisted messing with my psyche to the max for years.  If you're sitting on the fence, I'd say go ahead and jump in.  The water's fine.

She prescribed me 150mg of this drug. Initially it helped with my depression, but after a month I was still experiencing sleep problems. Then my memory and concentration significantly decreased. I experienced poor coordination, lethargy, and ""shakiness."" I fell back into a depression just based off of my symptoms."

3457$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/26/2007 11:28:50 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$You cannot drink alcohol while taking this medication. If you do drink, only limit to one alcoholic beverage per hour.  For mania and BPD symptoms, this drug works well in combination  with Lamictal (an anti-convulsant). This combo treatment helps immensely. Talk to your doctor about it.

3468$Condition: Depression$9/23/2007 4:23:40 AM$Reviewer: Edana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$5$I was on Prozac for years, and the doctor wanted to try Effexor XR. Within four months, I was suicidal and totally withdrawn. Saw a medicine specialist who put me on Wellbutrin, but I am still on the Effexor XR. It has proven nearly impossible to get off of it, unless I am willing to spend three weeks in a locked psychiatric ward. It doesn't seem to do anything until we try to titer me off the drug (300mg daily). Then I am in awful pain, sick, nauseated, and have to get back on it again. I am 61 years old and have a terminal illness. Considering that I should have been dead a year ago, I am just not willing to be shut away from husband and family for three weeks. My personal opinion is that the entire inventory of Effexor XR should be burned!

Then upped the dosage to 75mg as directed.  After I would say 6 months I wanted to cut back down to the 37.5 dossage.  I went off the charts. I went back to the 75mg, and since now I am at 150mg.  I hope that someday I will not have to take this anymore, but at this time it seems unlikely.

I have been on and off Effexor 3 or 4 times.  If you do not go off of this drug slowly it can cause terrible side effects.  If taken as the doctor prescribes, it is great.
