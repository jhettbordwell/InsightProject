She was just told upon filling her prescription that it will no longer be available.  She has had many breakthroughs on the previous drugs they have tried to use to treat her before.  Has anyone out there had any success with a replacement for thiothixene before?  She is extremely worried that she will not be able to fing an effective replacement

He bites so hard his tongue would bleed. He checked with his doctor and pharmacist and they never heard of this. His symptoms are gradually returning but he no longer bites his tongue.  He stopped against medical advice and soon will be in crisis.
