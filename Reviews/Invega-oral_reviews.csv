Non the less I hope not to take it any longer. I really dislike most side effects related to prolactin (even if it is what it makes it effective?).

She put me on welbutrin, but I was still terribly sick. I was really ready to give up, and go to a hospital. Then she started me on Invega 3 mg every night and I have NEVER felt this good, and I am 57, have had bp all of my life. I quit smoking several months ago, and have had two months of acute bursitis in both hips, so no exercise. So I have gained about 5 lbs, and think it's the combo of those three things. At this point, with the way I feel now, I can tolerate a little chubbiness!

Looking back after being on the Invega...I wasn't me.  I feel like I'm not in a fog any more or have to sleep all the time.  I can concentrate, I think clearly, I can write (I'm a college student so have many papers to write), I have my interests back.  I love this medication.  It as changed my life so much.  I actually enjoy doing things now...being with the family...interacting with everyone!!  Thank you so much for finding this medication.  In all the years I have had to deal with my Bi-Polar I have never felt more like myself then I do now (just without all the bad stuff!).  Oh, and a nice side effect is that I have lost 17 pounds which I put much more then that on when I was on the Risperdall.  This is a wonderful medication in so many ways!!

I have been on it for 3 years, and I have had no episode.  In fact, I am happy most of the time.  I did gain a lot of weight at first.  I gained 40 lbs initially, and now I am 25 lbs overweight.  It just increases your appetite.  Watch what and how much you eat, exercise, and you should be fine.  It saved my life!

I was diagnosed with Bipolar when I was 18 and am now 26. Over the period of 6 years I went through over 10 meds that didn't work. Invega is a miracle to me. I have not gained weight, in fact I have lost weight after being on Zyprexa. I do have raised prolactin levels and don't menstrate, but my mood is stable and I have not had an episode on over 2 years. This drug has worked for me and even with the side effects I will continue to take it.

His episodes of violent rage have completely vanished. He's a typical teen again. He has gained weight though. About 30 lbs. When I weigh the weight gain versus the violent eposides of rage... The weight gain wins, hands down. We couldn't have dealt with the rage anymore.

I've gone through about 7 doctors and even more medications.  The dosage that has finally been successful the past 2 years has been lithium, lamictal, and invega.  I used to take geodon, but my personal feelings of distress (more physical than anything else) made me beg for something else.  And then, whala!  A new drug called invega.  I soon was able to study for school better, my relationship with my then girlfriend now wife went to new heights; I even have been able to sustain a job for the past two years, all while buying my first home at 25 and a new car.  I truly attribute invega for giving me the stability to be myself again.

For a while I was taking 3mg then the dr. increased to 6mg due to some moody behaviors I still had however I have gained a lot of weight taking this medicine though I don't eat that much.

It seems to be helping my manic episodes cycle faster and my aggressiveness toward others has been decreased. I guess it's ok. I will know more when my dosage gets increased next week to 6mg. Since my psychiatrist is able to provide me with samples and it replaced the Geodon I was taking, which also costs a fortune. I will continue but have some fears in reagard to the numerous side effects this drug presents. I have noticed a severe increase in joint and muscle pain and stiffness in my body. I will write an update next month.

My complaint, though, and this is a big deal to me, is that I gained a lot of weight.  I believe they understate how much weight gain Invega can cause.  If you're really thin to begin with I wouldnt worry about it.  If you're on the heavy side to begin with then only take it if absolutely necessary.

My only concern is that I am having the prolactin side effect and am leaking breast milk.  My oldest child is 18, and I had a hysterectomy at 26, so pregnancy is impossible.

Currently,I am experiencing joint and muscle soreness.  I'm unsure, but I may be experiencing diarrhea as well.  My doctor prescribed Cogentin (2 mg) to relieve my joint and muscle pain.  I've only taken it for 4 days,but have seen considerable improvement. Since taking the Cogentin, I have seen a remarkable improvement to my mental outlook.  My diarrhea also seems much better.  Whether or not this is due to
the Cogentin, I don't know.  While taking Invega with 100 mg of Seroquel, I experienced anxiety and my mental outlook was poor.  I always looked at the negative side of things and fixated on the worst possible scenario.  It's unclear as to whether or not my psychiatrist will keep me on Invega.  "

The sleep problems went away and my behavior was fine for about 5 1/2 months. Now the sleep problems are startng again.  It seems I have slight problems breating and the tingling /twithching in my toes and feet are more severe.  I get real thirsty and drink lots of water.  It as if the systems in my body are shutting down and adrenalin is being pumped into my blood to keep my systems going which in turn keeps me awake.  The drug seems to calm me down but only for a short period of time after taking it. They just uped me from 6 mg to 9mg two days ago.  We will see how it goes.
