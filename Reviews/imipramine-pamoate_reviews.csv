1$Condition: Other$5/20/2014 1:48:07 AM$Reviewer: annette, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$5$I have been taking imiparmine for several years after trying several other drugs for panic attacks and agoraphobia this has worked the best for me. However it took years for the sweating and other side effects to pass but in the end it was worth taking. I tried to stop taking my symptoms returned almost immediately.  
2$Condition: Depression$1/16/2014 8:32:46 PM$Reviewer: trainwreck54, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$Imipramine has worked better than anything else for my serious psychiatric problems. I've been on it most of my life. The imipramine pamoate formulation seems to smooth out the side effects-tremor and dry mouth especially. The old tricyclic antidepressants have the spectrum of action of the new SNRIs and are much cheaper.

7$Condition: Depression$1/6/2011 7:02:33 PM$Reviewer: Jaime, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$"A couple years ago, I was given this as an addition to my zoloft.  I tried it for a couple weeks, but I couldn't stay on it.  I don't remember whether it helped my anxiety or depression, but I remember the side effects.

My muscles felt like I had the flu.  They would get fatigued very quickly.  They other thing is that my memory was totally shot.  I couldn't recall simple words that I use all the time.  I know that happens to everyone once in a while, but this was extreme.  It would happen 5 times in the same conversation.  I'd have to stop in the middle of a sentence and try to explain the definition of the word to the person I was speaking to.

May be a great for someone else, but it just didn't work for me."

10$Condition: Other$10/4/2009 4:08:46 PM$Reviewer: Sheba20, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$I fractured my spine in a car accident.  I have terrible chronic pain, and sometimes I get pretty depressed trying to cope with it every day.  Mr Dr prescribed this to help me sleep at night.  I feel like I have a bad hangover in the mornings, and feel very dingy.  I have to have a lot of focus at work and I can tell I probably will discuss not taking this drug with my doctor.

12$Condition: Other$3/12/2009 3:47:31 PM$Reviewer: Shanbanan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$4$I was given this drug in hopes of easing my Interstitial Cystitis symptoms. The worst side effect was panic attacks, and sweating. I had hot flashes, and was literally dripping sweat almost all day. It made school and work very diffucult, and embarassing. It did help my symptoms a bit, but I decided the side effects were not worth the small gain.
13$Condition: Other$2/14/2009 5:09:47 AM$Reviewer: bmollin, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I took 75mg each night before going to bed. After about a week I had my first full day in 6 months without getting any headaches and/or migraines. I really helped me in a big way. Wish I knew more about how it works.... - Thanks, Brian
