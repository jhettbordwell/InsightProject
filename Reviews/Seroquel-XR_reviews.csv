Worst of all it made me sleep walk I was in the back yard at one point. i have Major Depressive Disorder with anxiety difficulty sleeping I am now on a different med.
1$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/24/2019 2:19:48 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$2$3$I have been on 50 mg of Seroquel XR for 7 years with 1 mg of ativan when I need it. At first the medicine did wonders for me. I could sleep at night, wasn't having panic attacks on a daily basis, anxiety went down, and I felt normal again. However, after being on the same dose of it this long I am no longer getting those affects from it. Also I don't have bipolar or schizophrenia so don't know how useful it is to me anymore. I would say for people who need short term relief from severe anxiety/panic it is very helpful. I would say after taking it for about three or four years then I would get off it. The long term side effects are not worth it. 
2$Condition: Schizophrenia$5/12/2018 9:05:39 PM$Reviewer: Eli Johnson, 25-34 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$1$3$I have been taking Seroquel for 17 years. I started taking seroquel 25mgs per day and now Im on 800mg seroquel xr per day. It puts me to sleep. I gained 10lbs or less in 17 years. I have developed gynecomastia and cant wear a t shirt without some people mentioning my gynecomastia. My prescribing doctor says I look emasculate and skinny. My other doctor says my gynecomastia is noticeable when I take my shirt off. My doctor recommended that I see a specialist to check for male breast cancer with ultrasound and mammogram and the test is covered by my insurance. The doctor said there were no cancer cells thefore surgery to remove the gynecomastia isn't covered by insurance. I cant afford to pay for the true gynecomastia surgery to remove the hard breast tissue.
3$Condition: Schizophrenia$8/16/2017 5:57:24 PM$Reviewer: Shawn Low, 25-34 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$1$5$I have been taking Seroquel XR 800mg daily for almost 11 years. Before this I was on regular seroquel for many years. It really helps with my racing thoughts and sleep. Sometimes I get hives and have to take an antihistamine. I have recently noticed male gynecomastia and hard glandular tissue growth on my chest. 
4$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/25/2017 1:08:22 AM$Reviewer: LowEndMusic, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$4$Very satisfied. I've been taking Seroquel for about 8 years and have had no side effects, not even the weight gain. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I still get some depression (mania is completely calmed) and because as much as I love that it helps me sleep, I work nights and can't always get 8 hours so I am a bit groggy for the first few hours I'm up. Still satisfied and I wouldn't change off it.
5$Condition: Other$12/2/2016 11:09:23 PM$Reviewer: JohnsonBoy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"When I was prescribed Seroquel XR for severe anxiety recently, I wasn't expecting good results. Instead I anticipated getting bad side effects. I didn't like the idea of taking an anti-psychotic medicine. But almost immediately this XR version of Seroquel showed itself to be the best answer for me. 

It literally makes me 'normal', more normal than I've ever seen myself,  and so far none of the side effects I expected have occurred. Not even after the doctor doubled my dose to 100 mg. 

I am Cool-As-a-Cucumber around the clock, but not lethargic or lazy. I convey my thoughts in a measured and logical fashion, yet my personality isn't dulled. I stop sweating & trembling when around people, I don't fear everything. I sleep well and don't feel so depressed & hopeless when I wake up. And all that crazy paranoia seems to be gone now. 

Best of all I don't feel like a drugged-up zombie, nor is my vision blurred or my mouth dry - none of the side effects one would normally expect from an anti-psychotic drug. I wish I'd been introduced to Seroquel XR sooner. It doesn't give the same harsh side effects that regular (immediate release) Seroquel does."

Because the withdrawal effects are sooooo unbelievably nightmarish you will certainly wish you could die. Seriously, do your research, google ""Seroquel Withdrawal"", you have been warned."
7$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$5/28/2016 9:30:11 PM$Reviewer: Tony, 35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$300 mg at night for 7 years. Stopped on my own once and for about 6 months I was very manic and wound up in jail. That was 2014. No major problems since I take many other meds but if you try and stop on your own be careful the people you live with notice changes first. For me I thought I felt better to the point of casinos girls cocaine and 30000 in debt that still haunts me.

No noted weight gain or sedation.

However, I think it also makes me completely robotic and lifeless and the 'balance' I have in my life is actually me totally placating. I started on regular release and am now cutting myself off of XR. This drug makes me always groggy/hazy. Cannot wake up in the mornings. Pretty oblivious to things outside of myself. Totally uncreative. And, MAJOR weight gain. 
10$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$2/19/2016 11:05:14 AM$Reviewer: INeedSleep, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Within 10 minutes of taking ONE pill I fell to the floor and became catatonic. I have no memory of what happened but was told I was screaming at people, shaking like I was having a seizure but still talking, and very uncooperative. A complete opposite of my normal personality. The only thing I remember is taking the medication and then someone waking me up the next morning in the hospital. Every doctor that I've seen or talked to said that is not a side effect of Seroquel.

It does help and will help to keep me asleep    through the night most of the time.

13$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/22/2015 3:16:32 AM$Reviewer: goosegirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$2$4$Here is the thing about Seroquel XR, by the time I started taking it I was so desperate for sleep and some relief from my depression, I didn't care what it did to me. Five years later, my dosage doesn't work to help me sleep but twelve hours later I still can't get out of bed. It makes me feel DEPRESSED! I am so unmotivated to do anything and yes I get the late night munchies even though I'm almost falling down the stairs to get food because I'm groggy. I'm determined to wean myself off this drug. I think its good for a short term, but not long term. I tried cold turkey and I felt like I was dying for well over a month. I went back to half a dose. Sometimes if I haven't slept I take a whole dose. It's been months and that's as far as I've gotten. I don't know how long it will take me to finally get off of it. But I want off. Even at half a dose I have more energy than I have in the last five years combined. I feel like I belong as a participant rather than a bedside observer!
14$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/29/2015 8:02:06 PM$Reviewer: Mare Mare, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$The med did do what it should do. Help alot with my moods and best of all I could sleep at night. Was never over tired but did gain weight and with bad heart it that was getting hard to do things with getting worn out. Was given samples for almost a year but then hard to get and cost was 300 copay a month I then stop taking it. And i want to warn others do not just stop taking it. follow a doc plan to slowly stop it. I did cold turkey and was the worst 2 weeks of my life.( Still having problems) Very heavy headed and it was just a feeling i cant describe.Would not wish this on anybody.  If it wouldnt been the cost, I would had stay on it.
15$Condition: Other$5/3/2015 10:06:58 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"If I could opt out of giving any stars I would. I'm almost 17, I took this between November 2013 and March 2014. I got switched to this because I found Abilify and Lexapro were not working and requested to be taken off and onto a new kind of anti-depressant. My doctor gave it to me so I could sleep through the night and because I had ""mood swings"" that I didn't actually have. I started off directly on 200mg and then 250 in less than a month. The first week or so was fine but after I went down hill. I was not able to stay awake during the day for school. If I wasn't sleeping I was eating and if I wasn't eating I was either screaming at people and crying or shut off into my room alone. My mental health continued to go in the gutter until I had a break down that resulted in me having to go to a Psychiatric Center over the summer when beds were open. Other than the mental side, on the physical I was getting very sick. I was constantly nauseated and had stomach flu symptoms at least once a month. I gained 40lbs. I was not getting my period either. My energy was gone and I did not have the motivation to do anything. I pleaded with my Dr to take me off but instead she had boosted me up to 350 within two months and was going to put me up to 400 and then 450. This drug ruined my life before I took myself off of it. I had the highest grades in class and I came close to failing last year because it was hard to rebound from the damage in my grade. I do not suggest this drug if you have some sort of obligation in your life because if I were to be on it now I would probably have lost my job already and wouldn't be able to hold my grades for my goal of college. I honestly don't suggest it in general. This medicine is evil."
16$Condition: Other$4/30/2015 6:47:36 PM$Reviewer: ihateseroquel, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$Seroquel caused me to gain 40+ pounds in a matter of 2 months. Yes it stopped the anxiety, but all i did was sleep. I could not tell you anything about those two months aside from what I've been told, except that I was suicidal and had hallucinations until I was completely numbed. I'm covered in stretch marks and it took me over a month to get off of the medication. I hated every minute of it. Never take Seroquel.

I am seriously bipolar;however, that depression was profound. I would have died without proper treatment.  six months of ect and concurrent use of serequel worked like a miracle.  Sure, I have gained quite a lot of weight...but, i am alive and enjoying a good life free of anxiety, insomnia, and horrible depression.  Don't let weight gain cripple your life.

Do need to take in early evening to sleep and to avoid 'restless legs'. Taking in addition to Lithium and Lamotrigine. Depression phase has thankfully passed.
22$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/6/2014 10:33:18 PM$Reviewer: rdnkgrl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$"After OD-ing in a suicide attempt a month ago, I was put on 50mg Seroquel XR in the morning and 200mg at night, which was quickly increased to 400mg at night.  This med works great for the intended purpose...helps control my moods, helps me sleep better, I'm not suicidal anymore, and I find myself having more energy.  What I do not like, however, it that it has caused major weight gain! I have gone from weighing an acceptable (my opinion!) 120lbs to an absolutely horrible 140 lbs in a matter of one short month!!  I am only 5'4"", and although the medicine is definitely working for what it is supposed to, I find that I am getting depressed again over the weight gain issue, therefore cancelling out the benefits of the drug.  I have decided, after weighing myself today in the store at 142 lbs, that I have to stop talking this drug.  It will not do me any good if I keep gaining weight because I am becoming more depressed, therefore suicidal, because I consider myself fat and can't loose weight and I am hating myself.  For me the drug is not worth the side effects.  For someone who is not concerned about their weight it could be a miracle drug!"

PROS: I sleep much better, my mood is more stable, and I rarely enter into manic periods. I am almost a functioning human being again.

CONS: (1) I feel groggy for about 12-13 hours after taking any dose (25-150 mgs), which makes mornings feel nearly impossible, and has caused me to miss several important appointments. (2) About an hour after taking Seroquel I ALWAYS get insane munchies, worse than anything I ever felt smoking/ingesting pot, and then I get very drowsy. MIDNIGHT MUNCHIES + 12 HOURS SLEEP x SEVERAL MONTHS = SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT GAIN. (3) If I don't take my Seroquel, I don't sleep, and over time I have developed a tolerance for Seroquel, so I have to take increased quantities for it to be effective. (4) Recently my blood tests indicated that my liver is damaged, and my new doctor wants to start hunting around for alternatives to Seroquel, but I am reluctant."

I have taken as much as 600 mg., for depression and manic episodes.  It saved my life as I was suicidally depressed.  It went away really quick.  I went from weighing 160 to almost 300 lbs.  I could barely walk one house.  After having cataract surgery in both eyes, developing sugar diabetes, and so sleepy day and night, I changed my diet am walking 1 mile a day, and after two years have lost 150 lbs.  I can only eat around 1000 calories a day and was only eating 800 calories a day to begin weight loss.  If I eat bread I can gain 3-4 lbs in a day.  I am glad I'm not been depressed for a very long time, but can't stand the day time sleepiness.  My doctor has gradually gotten down to 150 mg. and am still as sleepy as can be.  The trade offs have been worth it up until now, but I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.  Don't know how low I can go and still get the good affects of keeping my moods stable.
30$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$6/7/2014 3:19:58 PM$Reviewer: humancondition, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$4$4$"My main uses for SQ are for nervous agitation, depression and anxiety, combined with Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I switched from regular, immediate release Seroquel (I'll abbreviate it SQ) after several years to Seroquel XR (SQXR) because I'd been decreasing the dose gradually over the course of about a year from 600 to 200 mg a day, and the doctor suggested I take regular SQ once a day. At that point, I was taking 200 mg at night, 50 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the afternoon. I was leery of suddenly switching to 300 mg regular SQ once a day at bedtime because I was afraid the effects wouldn't last throughout the day, so I switched to XR instead of regular SQ. The first night I took SQXR I thought I felt nauseous the next day, but that was the only time. I quickly & easily adjusted to a single dose of SQXR at bedtime, with no problems. It continued to work all day, but I no longer had the sleepiness or slightly ""loopy"" feeling I used to get from taking the immediate release drug during the day. This is a significant benefit. In general, side effects from SQXR are less than from regular SQ, and I hear this is the case for many patients. (Be warned: your insurance company may charge you a lot more to get the XR version. Currently XR is not available in generic. If you don't have insurance, you'll pay more than an arm and a leg for SQXR. Even worse, my insurance company had to get special approval from my doctor and put me through a lot of rigamarole to get XR because it was a ""special"" or non-formulary medication.) After several months on XR and working down to 200 mg/day, I've now switched back to regular SQ (to save money, mainly), 150 mg once at day at bedtime. I used to take XR at 10:30 and sometimes wouldn't get to sleep until 2 am. Now I take regular SQ and fall asleep by 12 am. I haven't had any trouble switching to regular generic SQ 1/day. XR has fewer side effects, takes longer to work, costs more. If you want to take XR, you'll probly adjust easily to it."

35$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$2/21/2014 2:11:25 PM$Reviewer: Be of good cheer!, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Seroquel XR as a PRN medication for me together with the combination of 2 other medications (Depakote ER and a once-a-month intramuscular injection: Invega Sustenna) have done wonders for the control of the Bipolar I Disorder mental issue that I have. For years I've struggled with not getting enough sleep at one time period. My extremes of mood swings are ever so much lighter and the manic and depressive phases likewise more controlled.
As in all cases one medication may not work as well for one person as another and maybe not the same dosage either or combination of meds. There are differing dosages of Seroquel XR that may be needed to adjust the amount. I have found out throughout the years that if I could get the proper amount of sleep, most of the time, I wouldn't have a situation whereby I needed to be hospitalized. I've lost count as to the nummber of times hospitalized.
As with all medications it takes time(usually 2 t0 3wks.) to realize if a medication will be successful and most the time there will also be side effects and some are only temporary. I highly recommend that a person not self-medicate with illicit drugs. Watch out for triggers that will sabotage your well-being. As always if possible have a mental health professional guide you through your journey dealing mental hygiene. Do not give up!

I had to self medicate with alcohol before this and my alcohol dependence went away. My severe alcoholism caused 2 hip replacements. The earlier in the evening you take it, the better your tomorrow will be because this drug at 300mg will be noticably on you the next day. Sleep all night guaranteed. The best relief for my extreme nervousness and anxiety. Keep the dose around 150mg 2hrs before bedtime so you can still function the next day. Higher doses cause high grogginess  the next day. This drug at low doses is better than other popular drugs at high doses. I didn't experience any weight gain. Highly recommend this for manic depression anxiety PTSD bi-polar ect. Astra Zenca, the manufacturer, will give it to you free with perscrip. and if you are under $30,000 or ther abouts. Otherwise its about $500/month without insurance "

I was on Lexapro and Abilify before hand and did not like those at all. I was put on this for being ""bi polar"" and to help me sleep. The first two weeks I felt so much better and could sleep better. However, I soon found that I was sleeping all of the time and my mood just got worse. I was a straight A student who always paid attention in class and I turned into a student who rarely went to school and was always sleeping. I began to have horrible nightmares that I would sometimes wake up panting and terrified. I'm normally a hard worker but on this medicine I was disinterested in everything that came up. My health greatly declined while on this medicine both physically and mentally. When I couldn't take my medicine for a week after leaving it at an aunts, with in a few days I was a wake and alert and much happier. The only thing that happened was I was extremely itchy. I was on a high dose from the beginning but I don't think being on a small one would do anything to help. I am now three weeks off this medicine and I feel amazing and able to handle everything going on."

Boosted from 50mg.regular, to 100mg. regular, for a minute. Just when the sleep started gettin' back to normal, Dr. upped to 150mg.XR. Since beginning it, I've had less-than sleeps, am cranky and irritable, especially in the morning. I have weight gain and am not happy about that. This is not helping the insomnia and is instead just making me angry. I will be demanding a return to the 100mg. when I next see the Dr.

45$Condition: Other$10/16/2013 12:27:56 PM$Reviewer: $5$2$5$After being a lifelong insomniac I was prescribed 100mg seroquel at night and became a completely different person. Because I had been living my life staying up too long and then crashing too long and I didn't realize how much that was taking its toll on my body. With seroquel, I would take the pill and within a half an hour drift away for exactly 8 hours of sleep and wake up feeling refreshed. Unfortunately, I had to give it up because I was sleepwalking. It started out small, with me waking up to find pretzel crumbs in my bed and the like. Then one night about 5 months in I woke up in the middle of walking down the stairs and got scared and spazzed out and tumbled down the stairs. I wasn't seriously hurt, just scrapes and bruises, but I thought I should tell my pdoc and he took me off it it before anything worse happened  :(.

I worked up to 300mg.  I took the medication at night & it would knock me out for 10 – 12 hours straight.  I gave it a couple months to see if the side effects would lessen.  They didn’t.  So we cut my dosage in half down to 150mg.  I still slept a lot & I could not get moving the next day.  I kept taking the meds thinking things would level out over the next few months.  They didn’t.  The medication did not help my depression at all & on top of that my body felt so drugged.  I was so weak that I could barely take care of every day household chores.  I almost never left my house because I always felt so bad both emotionally & physically.  We cut my dosage down again & a couple months later I still felt horrible.  I WAS A PRISONER IN MY OWN BODY!!  I read that other people gained weight on this medication.  I actually LOST weight.  I have always been thin but while on this medication I started to look like a walking skeleton.  I live alone & I was too weak & tried to even get up to cook.  I was only eating one small meal a day.  It was quite scary watching myself literally withering away.  I finally asked my doctor to get me off Seroquel.  She prescribed Citalopram (generic for Lexapro) and after just two weeks I am starting to feel better & I am eating better also.  I regret wasting almost a year of my life on Seroquel.  I should have gotten off of it sooner.  Live & learn.

I have a history of manic-depression and I was on the depressive side. Seroquel xr worked extremely well and had me functioning again. My Dr. was knowledgable and supportive which played a key role in my well being.
  After 2 or 3 years I began feeling disillusioned about life. I had gained some extra 80 pounds. I didn't really expect this but it probably was worth it because it saved my life. The Dr. gave this drug as an alternative from what I had been taking. Believe me if you don't need the drugs you're better off living a healthy lifestyle. Growing up in the era of drugs and alcohol I did my share and attribute this to my life."

The ones most bothersome from seroquel are as follows:  I need to get about 10-12 hours of sleep each night.  Otherwise I am too sleepy.  Just after I take seroquel, and I feel ready to go to sleep, I lay down and it only lasts for about 10 minutes.  This is where you can't eat unless it is low in calories and carbs.  The drug gives me a big appetite, and think thats why people who are taking this drug get diabetes.  I was newly diagnosed with diabetes  about 8 weeks ago.  Now if I eat sweets, etc, I get a very fast heartrate, and stomach ache.    I really don't like seroquel, but I have to take it because I act like myself and not like an idiot when I don't.  Its not for idiots, but for me it is for a disturbed mind with ups and downs of emotions and everything is a big question mark.  hard to explain.  Hope this helps

Not a good experience. Tiredness would begin to kick in after an hour.  Slept fine but wouldn't want to physically or psychologically get up in the morning.  Unmotivated upon waking, bad mood, irritable.  Felt better as the day progressed because the Seroquel was getting out of my system.  I know you're supposed to take it for several days until any anxiety relief kicks in and a few weeks until depression relief kicks in but I couldn't make it.  The drowsiness and crabbiness wasn't worth fighting through for that long to see if it would have even worked anyway.

After taking it for a while it helped me with constant mind racing and with insomnia.  But the biggest downfall with this medication is severe weight gain and appetite increase.  I fall asleep fast but still get up in the middle of the night to eat.  I spilled a bowl of cereal in my lap in the middle of the night a few days ago. I gained 5 pounds in less than a month.  I have takin this medicine for 3 months and as of yesterday the only side effects were eating wayyyy to much and a lil spacey at times.  Well because of my eating habits I asked my doc. for a different medicine that didnt have weight gain.  She gave me GEODON.  Tonights my first night and I'm scared because the reviews are horrid.  I prayed to my lord Jesus, and all will be well.  Seroquel Is a great medicine though.

I was suffering with this before taking it (except dizziness), but now I'm constantly worrying about my heart, and I had no idea this could actually be the cause for this. I also told my doctor about my heart problems but apparently health doesn't matter to these people as long as you're on something. Will be contacting my doctor soon to try something else.

These are the one's for which I've had some relief by taking Seroquel XR 200mg 2 to 3 hours before bedtime: anxiety, insomnia, & psychosis. I firmly believe getting enough sleep each night on a regular basis is one of the best strategies for avoiding mental health crises along with proper diet and exercise routines. Doing things for others can often be therapeutic in his/her own health situations! I've had biploar 1 disorder since ~ 14 and I'm now 54 - by the grace of God, His mercy, and Providence am I still alive as likewise all other humans. Have a good day!

She always knows who her family is, is an avid reader of the newspaper and can discuss topics with you, she just asks the same questions quite often. She's had some trouble sleeping at night and after Ambien had failed to work her doctor prescribed Seroquel XR. We immediately noticed a change in her. She was very groggy and would hardly stay awake. When she was awake she was responsive to conversation but also very ""zoned out."" My mother had requested this medication to be discontinued after consulting with my uncle who is a physician. He is strongly against the use of this medication in elderly patients with dementia. One side effect listed is death in patients with dementia! She has now been admitted to a rehab facility for 2 days and we have been very concerned as she will hardly wake when speaking to her and has absolutely no appetite. I was sitting with her this evening and noticed she had been sweating. This is very rare as she is extremely cold natured. We have found in fact the Seroquel XR had NOT been discontinued and we are EXTREMELY FURIOUS! Although my grandmother is up in age and had an incident I STRONGLY believe this medication is the culprit in her recent behavior.

In the nine days on seroquel, I had four migraines. I am good at avoiding triggers, but was unable to stave off migraines while taking this medication. I was on a very low dose (50mg once daily at night). 

I would not recommend this medication for those without insurance coverage or who experience migraine headaches.

I spoke to him some time ago and stated I felt there was potential for weight gain and he assured me it was not so.  I have since been informed that weight gain is highly likely.  My next visit to him is somewhat in the future, so I will contact my medical doctor to see if he can prescribe something for the insomnia. Afterwhich I will stop taking the seroquel.  I have had knee replacement surgery on both knees and was doing much better before the weight gain.  I will begin a water zumbia class the twenty sixth of March.  I am very uncomfortable with the added garth as well do not appreciate not fitting into my clothes and having to buy more.

I started taking seroquel at the tender age of 13 after a series of medication trials and failures. It has at the very least kept me from going off the deep end.. I do know that when I haven't been able to afford the $478 (and rising all the time) for a 30 day supply of 150mg daily I feel the effects of not having it- i get depressed, cannot focus at all, angry at everything, fidgety, restless- cannot sleep at night at all. When I'm on it I mostly feel foggy, my memory has declined significantly since taking it (no other reason sticks out as to why). It has contributed to many small failures in my professional life, but I know I wouldn't be alive to hold a job without SOME meds. I take in conjunction with Wellbutrin- it has been a good combo for me, but no cure all. I've had weight gain, tremors, constant constipation.. I cannot keep focused enough to finish sentences in many cases and it's extremely embarrassing to look like a fool like that. I would recommend this medication to those who haven't and need to try something because it's been better than nothing and it has generally contributed to a better quality of life for me. Now if only I could rid myself of the life sentence that is bipolar disorder. I really worry about the long term effects (diabetes is probably not fun)."

The shakes and side effects from the Lithium was a million times what I now experience with the Serequel XR.  When the doctor first prescribed it as a replacement, I resisted at first because of the extreme drowsiness and sleepy hangover that the regular Serequel had caused me when I was once prescibed it.  However, the XR has a whole different efffect on me.  It has been so much more manageable than the Lithium with next to no side effects.  I take it 1-2 hours before I need to go to bed and wake with a clear head.  It has helped the mania like never before - I used to have days that I would not leave the house so not to interact with people, that is rare now.  I really like this drug, and it has been a life saver for me.  It may have been difficult to adjust to at the beginning, I honestly don't remember - but if so, work with your dr. to find the right dose - once that happens, it is so worth the work.

Fortunately, I've been able to get off of it. This drug caused intense, scary visual and auditory hallucinations, nightmares, significant weight gain, increase in mammary size, and anti-social tendencies. Before you freak out about my credibility, prior to becoming bipolar, I was a practicing psychologist, family therapist, a university professor, (Psych) and socially well-adjusted. I am also taking, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Lorazepan, and Temazapan. In the last two weeks, I quit smoking, and quit Seroquel. The hallucinations have stopped, the voices have stopped and I feel more at ease. The medical model of mental health is really a no-win situation. One brief example that reminded me of the frustration of long-term self-medication; I had a bone spur on my elbow and waited 2 months before seeing my family doctor, I didn't want to take any additional medication. Well, I had it bass-ackwards. After 3 DAYS! on Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory, my elbow stopped hurting. After 3 YEARS on the aforementioned meds, I still get depressed. All the literature states that these meds will restore the ""deficiency"" of neurotransmitters and encourages you to keep on taking them. Well, where's the cure? Look at the  list to the left, there's 25 meds for depression. How did the neurotransmitters become depleted, that's my question. I am beginning to realize that being depressed is depressing. Maybe we should allow ourselves to feel anxiety in manageable doses and work through it, instead of sedating our more painful emotions. That's what I'm going to try. Wish me luck. Peace. MK-ULTRA"

The weight gain is starting... 7 lbs so far.  I should be able to manage it by keeping tabs on my diet.  The increase in prolactin has given me larger breasts.

She was then promised freedom if she took a higher dose, and the medicine that had previously caused her organs to begin shutting down, all while she was not able to make logical, rational, healthy decissions for herself.

That is how the head of the ward at the Rockyview hospital works. He gets someone else to do the diagnosis then over doses on meds. I also had severe PTSD over a home burning down and then 6 months later losing my job and the house I had purchased and everything I owned. This was not considered important and not addressed. So, the value of this med to me is based on major misdiagnosis. I had no remission of depression and no help with sleeping. I not only had no help with depression it got worse. I could not move my neck anymore. I was told this did not matter. I could no longer reason well and, as a Systems Analyst, it was critical that I be able to think. This did not matter either. I was taken off Seroquel cold turkey and thought I was going to die though this had happened with Effexor too.
I believe we are all guinea pigs. I trust my GP more to know what is going on but I have to have a psychiatrist to get my paperwork done for early retirement and nothing to show for a life of hard work. "

The weight gain on Seroquel is unbearable for me even though the medication is effective for treating my manic episodes and insomnia.  I'd almost prefer the mania to the weight gain though. Also, possible hypoglycemia, tardive dyskenisia, and potassium disruption in the heart cause me to question whether I should take Seroquel.

This has helped me to sleep like you wouldn't believe. No more midnight cleaning episodes! I have diabetes and my sugars are slightly up but I can live with that if it means my bipolar is under control. I am trying harder to watch what I eat and exercise more, I have gained a few kilos but nothing scary. And again, I can handle gaining a few if my moods are ok. I still have slight ups and downs but nothing that I can't handle with a bit of downtime and some me time. I am now on seroquel xr 400mg to see how I go...am a little anxious that I won't be able to sleep but will have to wait and see how I go. I am hopeful that it will help to really even me out and I can get on with living life. :)

Within a month I was feeling much better and was able to get off the numerous other meds I was taking - including a very heavy sleeping pill that didn't work a lot of the time.  I take a total of 600 mg before supper along with Lamictol and Rivotril.  My only problem with Seroquil is the weight I have gained because of it.
