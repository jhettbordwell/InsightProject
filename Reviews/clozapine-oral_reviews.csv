It is the most destructive brain altering drug known to man!
There is no way of getting off it without major relapse! FACT
It should never be a last resort med!!!
If you want to end some ones life put them on this med!

I've tried pretty much all of the schizophrenia medicines. And this one is the best. It has stopped hallucinations, delusions, everything. The only thing i don't like about it is how much it makes me sleep. I've went from about 8 hrs a night to 12. Its still worth it though."

10$Condition: Bipolar Disorder in Remission$8/14/2012 1:43:59 AM$Reviewer: BipolarVet, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$1$I am taking 25 mg per night to address the manic part of my bipolar disorder.  Even at such a low dosage, it makes me very drowsy and it's hard to get started in the morning.  On average, I sleep between 10-12 hours a day with clozapine, when I used to sleep more like 7-8 hours.  Also, I have to have quite frequent blood tests to make sure my white cell count is not too low from the clozapine.  However, in spite of all these negatives, I still am glad to be on it because it has helped me remain stable and avoid hospitalizations for the past year and 8 months.

He attempted suicide 2 times heard voices and thought tv and radios were talking to him. He had been in mental hospital 3 times, and it was not until a very excellent psychiatrist started him on clozaril, that it was like a miracle. He is on very low doses and can function now , go to school and work. He is also on low dose lithium at bedtime. Although monthly blood draws can be a nuisance , it is well worth the inconvenience.  he also has an excellent therapist who helps him look forward and not rehash the past.

18$Condition: Schizophrenia$1/23/2010 12:07:24 PM$Reviewer: [email protected], 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) $2$1$2$I am the younger brother and legal guardian to a 55 year old femal that has been on this treatment (colzapine) for approximately 20 years and we are finding that there are many problems after prolonged use of this medication. The reason that this treatment was sought was because the alternitive tretments were so devistateing to her general health and mental behavior. The alternitive medications were stelzine, thorzine, and heldol. Currently she is recieving 500 mg per day of clozapine along with other medications but as of the last 6 months she has been experianceing total regression of her illness, in other words she now is worse than she's been in the past 15 years. I would like to find a alternitive to clozapine. I would like to try a medication that was designed for a female if at all possible. She has been hospitalized 4 times in the last 6 months and I'm running out of options. Any sugestions would be greatly appretiated.

23$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$7/9/2009 2:08:32 AM$Reviewer: Mia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$1$My 42 yr old son had paronoid bipolar and was on clozapine for l6 days.  He wasn't even suicicidal.  He died on the l6th day of being on clozapine. He died of a heart attack.   I say take this horrible drug off the market.  It kills people.  He was healthy before he started taking clozapine.  I blame the doctor for putting him on it when he wasn't even suicidal.  There were other drugs he could have put him on.  Now we lost out beautiful 42 yr old son.

Found that using Clozapine with Haldol (or other antipsychotic) is not a good idea.  Clozapine alone, is best.  Give it at least 6-9 months and don't be afraid to go up on dosage if all testing indicates ok to do so.

The only real problem I had was the dosage.  This pill comes in a 50mg tab and I cut it to 25mg and I was still dizy so I cut that in 1/2 so 12.5 mgs and now I'm very good.
