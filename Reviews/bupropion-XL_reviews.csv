2$Condition: Depression$1/4/2019 11:44:46 AM$Reviewer: teechur, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"I started on Bupropion to deal with my depression after I'd lost a lot of interest in a lot of things I'd previously loved like running, competing, exercise, etc. I was crying a lot for no reason, and my previous good self esteem was in the toilet. It really helped with the crying, but it increased my anxiety dramatically and I'd never had anxiety before. I also feel it made my emotions very ""flat"". So instead of crying all the time I was having very few emotions even when I should be. I went from a formerly bubbly, motivating person (prior to the depression) to a quiet, withdrawn person who was too afraid to go outside and run and running has been my life for 15 years. I'm going to talk to my doctor about reducing the dose. "
3$Condition: Depression$1/3/2019 10:05:42 AM$Reviewer: guigeek, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking Bupropion HCI XL 300 mg for about 10 years.  It is the only medication that works for me with the least amount of side effects (dry mouth and itching). I do take an allergy pill as well. I don't walk around crying for no reason or get upset over little things. I don't have thoughts of wanting to die anymore.  I quit smoking, cold turkey, 3 years ago and have remained a non-smoker.  This drug has been great for me.

I have extreme joint pain in my thighs, arm & thumb.  I am currently in the process of tapering off of Bupropion.

I have a history of depression and recently diagnosed with AdultADD. I did begin to notice a lil less procrastination more motivated to do at least 1 task. My moods have been upbeat more often. I smoke cannabis so my urge for that has decreased. Although, 3rd day in I woke up with the most painful headache stemming from last night. I thought if I sleep on it; then it will go away in the morning. It hasn't. To b cont'd.

I feel better, but I'm sure it will get even better than before.  My lower back started aching within 24 hours and I'm hoping this subsides.  I will tell my doctor in 3 weeks, but I see there are others with this symptom.
7$Condition: Depression$3/29/2017 4:45:48 PM$Reviewer: meggie, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$I had been on Lexapro 10 mg once daily.  I had lost my mother and brother within nine months of each other.  I was devastated.  My husband suffered a spinal cord injury at our summer vacation at ocean city in 2011.  I have been getting worse. My doctor prescribed bupropion 150 sr once daily two weeks ago in addition to the Lexapro. I have only been taking 75 mg as I have reactions to certain drugs.   I feel better during the day but still experience anxiety every morning.  I like to have an alcoholic drink but feel it does not agree with the bupropion.  Any advice would be so helpful. 
8$Condition: Depression$2/7/2017 10:24:41 AM$Reviewer: goodvibes, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I am very new to anti-depressants but after my anxiety attacks and depression getting out of control my doctor suggested them. I was on Zoloft for months but my sex drive went way down. My doc then put me on 300mg of Burpropion. I have been on it for about six months and the results are amazing. I feel like my normal self again and my sex drive also went back to normal. I had a little chunk before but I lost it all totaling 35 lbs of weight loss. I feel amazing. I am diagnosed with Depression and PTSD so for me this medicine did the trick! 
9$Condition: Depression$1/21/2017 12:26:54 PM$Reviewer: DEC, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"This drug saved my life, and probably my marriage. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever. I started on 150mg time release two years ago, and after six months increased to 300mg time release. I take it early every morning once per day, but do not find that it has any effect my ability to sleep. One artifact of taking Bupropion is that I can no longer drink alcoholic beverages without feeling awful, so I have quit drinking completely. This is probably for the best, as before I started using this medication, I drank heavily for 20 years in an attempt to ""self medicate"" my depression. Even though I still love the taste, I have no desire to drink anymore - I'm much happier living without depression than I ever was getting drunk. It seems a small price to pay for the miracle that it has performed in my brain chemistry. I still feel down and sad from time to time, but now it's because I have a reason for it, like people with normal brain chemistry. You're supposed to have mild depressed feelings when bad things happen, and so I've learned to distinguish between these feelings and the depression I lived with most of my life. I have more energy, am more motivated, and can retain my mental focus better than I have in years. I'm more willing to and capable of interacting socially with people, despite being a severe introvert. I'm less of a pessimist and generally more pleasant to be around now than before I began treatment. I wish I'd been prescribed it when I was a teenager, as I believe my life could have been so different. I wouldn't stop taking Bupropion at this point even if they tried to tell me that I didn't need it anymore. I expect to take it for the rest of my life, and I'm fine with that."

The became a point that I was complacent thinking that the drug was no longer worker for me.  I ended up not refilling and after a few days of not taking it, I started to feel horrible.  Anxiety and depression all came back full speed ahead.   It was then I realized that this drug really was doing wonders for me.   I take in the morning because at night it would keep me up.

I have seen a change in my depression for the better. I especially suffer from morning depression. I do not suffer from anxiety (thank GOD). I take two pills in the morning. The side effects do have me a little concerned. I have been feeling light headed, especially in the morning. Also a little bit a nausea as well. My doctor said the side effects will subside over time; we'll see.
14$Condition: Depression$12/4/2015 2:52:04 AM$Reviewer: Neelson, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have severe depression and this medication has worked great for that. I have only experienced two side effects. My blood pressure has risen a little bit, it used to be in the typical range.  And I am frequently nauseous. My stomach doesn't hurt. The nausea is mainly due to my neck being sensitive. If I have a necklace on or something around my neck, I will gag a lot. And sometimes I throw up. But taking ompeprazole has helped with the nausea.  Overall I am thankful for the medication.

I didn't want to leave the house and did not even want the phone to ring because that meant I had to talk with someone. I feel completely normal again while taking this medicine. Have your vitamin  D checked. Mine was very low and this also contributes to depression. I currently am on 2,000 units of vitamin D also and I like having my old self back. I am once again happy and enjoying my life.

It took me almost 2 weeks to get up the nerve to actually swallow this pill because I was so scared of the side effects. I am so glad that I did..It has helped me tremendously. The first couple of days were alittle rough adjusting to the side effects. But they were really no worse than what I was already experiencing..Jittery, nervous,agitated,emotional. If you are scared of taking this medication..please don't be! I was diagnosed with depression and was having severe panic attacks. I was given Bupropion HCL Xl and Xanax. I started out on 150mg tablets for the first week then started on the 300mg 1 x a day. What a difference this medicine has made. I am much more calmer now and my mood swings have greatly improved. So please don't be afraid to take this medicine because of the ""bad reviews""..I was the same way I would read the reviews and talk myself out of taking it. Atleast give it a chance...I know I'm sure glad I did!"

Tried Paxil briefly when I was younger and had intense side effects- sleep, teeth grinding, sex drive, felt more miserable. Few years later tried the generic of Wellbutrin XL. Started the first month at 150mg and didn't notice too much, then up to 300mg and felt a near immediate substantial improvement. Much more energy, less likely to let sad thoughts fester, much easier to get out of bed in the morning.

Lost my health insurance and fell off the medication for about 9 months and the last three got bad. Started back up a few weeks ago and after a couple days adjusting (side effects of a sort of mild vertigo, trembly hands) I've got the energy back and feel more capable. It's shown me the possibility of a tolerable, if not enjoyable life."

It was been very helpful, I'm no long crying over everything, and nothing. It has also helped my ADHA. My only problem is the VA doesn't carry the extended release formula, which would allow me to go from 4 tablets a day to 1 a day. With all the other meds I have to take daily any reduction is good.

It is a high-grade amphetamine. Don't let any doctor lie to you about it. I took it 5 years and have been off it 3 years, taken off this poison by a nonAmerican doctor who doesn't buy into the ""give-a-pill"" theory of medicine. Wellbutrin has changed my brain permanently. I was never angry before. Now I live every day very angry. My life is hell filled with anger. This medication is poison. Please, don't do this to your life and your brain. Run very far. I would give anything not to have taken this poison. I'm very sure my Medicare paid for the mags on my first doctor's Porsche. Eat right and exercise. Do not surrender to the ""medicines"" Rx companies give you. They don't care what it does to your brain. They only care about their profits. PLEASE, PLEASE take this seriously. Or you will be awakening every morning irrationally filled with hate and anger when you never were before. That's where I'm at now. I don't know when it will end. If ever.

At first, I felt some occasional mild dizziness but that was only temporary and it was nothing serious.  I have experienced some memory issues as well but nothing that has affected daily life negatively.  I have tried to cut down to one a day but I felt depressed feelings coming back.  It worked especially well when I was on a walking regimen.

BIG mistake to switch from Pristiq to this.  This medication has made me feel like a zombie.  I feel achy, hungover, tired, depressed, and have lost all energy and will to exercise.  The only thing that helped me last night was taking 50 mg of the Pristiq again. I am stopping this generic immediately.  I would be willing to try the brand name Wellbutrin XL as I have read many reviews stating that the generic and brand name versions are very, very different.  I would be willing to bet that I would not have had this negative experience if my doctor had prescribed the the brand name version instead of the generic.  Now, onto Fetzima tomorrow.  Hopefully that works better!

My dose started out with 45mg per day which I would recommend, reduces the risk for any side effects. I am now up to 300 XL with 150 SR upon waking. The only side effect I have experience was dizziness when starting the med. I now have been on the bupropion for 6 months with only positive results. This med is not given for people with anxiety disorders because it does act as more a stimulant.

This was before it was prescribed for people who wanted to quit smoking.  I mentioned that to my doctor and he discounted it.  Whatever.  Bupropion worked very well for me with my chronic depression for a few years mostly by helping me focus and get out of bed in the morning.  I switched to Paxil when the side effects of clenching my jaws and muscle tremors outweighed the benefits.  Paxil was awful -- I picked my skin, drank too much alcohol, had no impulse control, couldn't cry, gained weight.  Tried Zoloft next -- suffered massive, gross skin sores; toe, foot and leg cramps; urinary incontinence.  Then tried Cymbalta which seemed like it worked, but was too expensive, so I went back to bupropion.  It's worked really well for a few months.  My skin is good again and my emotional responses are normal.  I can get up and go in the morning, even though I'm very wakeful during the night.  I lost my Paxil weight.  However, I'm bummed because I'm starting the jaw clenching again and feel that slide toward needing another change.  Ack!  At least I'll be retired in a couple of weeks and only my daughters and dogs will have to join me for my next medication ride.  I'm hopeful it'll be a smooth transition.

And just maybe i can repair my relationship with my husband. I had 2 strokes in '97 which put me on this horrible path of mental pain and it makes me depressed just thinking how long it took me to figure everything out.

I wanted to try Adderall for focus on school and general duties; along with depression, but doctor gave me this. Overall, this worked for me. I got out of bed, got done what NEEDED to, and lost weight fast,which motivated me more. After 1 week, I decided to get off it because of my circumstances...new job, school-had to perform as all eyes were on me, and most certainly felt that. The bad...I was overly self-conscious, my heart raced to where I felt tired but felt I had to do something because I couldn't sleep. My memory sucked...I felt spacey. Now, if I weren't in the new job with all this pressure, I would have stuck with it to see if SE went away. My question to ANYONE out there (please answer!!) is do these SE go away? Thinking to ask for half the dose and up it as needed. In the meantime, has anyone divided the tablet or is that not recommended with Extended release? Many thanks for any info. I am not on any other drugs by the way. Oh yes, another great thing...I am a heavy drinker which I found hard to stop but this helps and that is a wonderful thing...fewer cravings.

After I take the Bupropion I can feel the effects for about an hour, but after that nothing.  It makes me tired & sleepy.  Im thinking maybe my dose needs to be raised and I need to be put on the extended release tab instead.  I go back to the doctor in a week so I will voice my concerns then. 
48$Condition: Depression$1/23/2014 2:10:58 AM$Reviewer: berlinATX, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $3$1$5$"I had taken Wellbutrin for depression with successful results approx 10 years ago and had very favorable results: I had energy to get through the day, felt all-around better. But eventually it just stopped working (and I had reached the maximum dosage/day)I found the more I spoke to others who were taking the med (or had taken) said they had the same experience. 
Now I've been taking Prozac for the same reason and it works shockingly well but I have 0 libido...no more like -25 libido and have no highs or lows. Granted I'm not crying and it's helped my fibro-myalgia, improved my sleep and cut down on sweating but I'm a creative person and have lost all creative emotion. Enter Wellbutrin again. First day I've got pupils so dilated I can hardly function, massive anxiety, can't sleep, can't eat, nausea, everything smells strong and sickens me. I felt generally serotonin sick. I think if I had a benzo script I could muddle through but I've yet to have any psychiatrist give me one in over 5 years since Xanax got ""trendy"". Needless to say, I'm back at Prozac until I can even tell my doctor what happened. 
My advice is follow your gut. If you feel really horrible, it's probably not worth forcing it. I've done that with other meds like Paxil and wound up in the ER with mania and not a single doctor in the whole place intersted in or able to help...and that's scary."

The more he asked me questions, the more I finally realized that I was depressed and had been for a couple of years. I was having such negative dark thoughts and the doctor prescribed this to me with a high dosage immediately.  It took a few weeks but I am so glad I got help.  I started to feel better, had more energy where before I could barely make it through the day. I lost weight and started feeling more positive.  I experienced an increase in libido and a slightly decreased appetite.  I started exercising and although I've suffered some additional setbacks, I have learned how to deal with them and keep moving forward.  I have forgotten to take my pills for 2-3 days at a time and I have began to feel ""icky"" again.  I am a work in progress and I hope that one day I will be able to live pill free by exercising regularly and eating a clean diet...I am working towards that but for now I am very happy with this medicine.  As for side effects, I am lactose intolerant and have IBS so any nausea or other discomfort have been indistinguishable.  I have occasionally experienced dizziness and slight headaches but other than that, I have not significant side effects.  "

I went and saw a psychiatrist instead of my primary care physician who knows nothing about mental health. The psychiatrist first started me on 150mg of Bupropion and advised me to continue to take the Cymbalta as well. The first week I could feel a major difference. I had a hard time sleeping at night but that went away after a week. But my feelings and moods were changing and I felt so much happier. Within the first month of taking 150mg, my appetite decreased, my energy INcreased, my moods became much more pleasant...and I was becoming a more positive person. But I was still feeling a few signs still of my Depression. My bed is my ""safe haven"" and where I go when I am depressed, I nap. I encountered about a handful of naps in that one month. I was still feeling like a worry-wart and had irritation issues. So when I saw the psychiatrist again after those 4 wks, he increased my dosage to the 300XL while still taking 120mg of Cymbalta. This is now my 2nd week taking this medicine with the increased dosage... and I feel absolutely amazing. I feel as though I have woken up from a deep sleep. I have so much energy. I can exercise because I have motivation. I am so much more pleasant with people at work and just in general. I can think rationally and be positive. I feel absolute love for myself. I no longer feel like a worthless, ugly, ashamed individual who could never leave the house. I feel A L I V E. I could literally hug my psychiatrist for listening to me and not over-medicating me. This medicine has helped me so much, you have to give it the full 4wks to feel the effects but wow. It has changed my entire life. "

I never felt a difference on either dosages; I was still very depressed and still had several crying episodes.  The feeling of sadness and emptiness still lingered.  I hoped it would help with my anxiety as well, but it didn't help with that either.  I'm not surprised by the ineffectiveness of this drug because I have never taken an antidepressant that has changed my mood and kept my anxiety at ease.  I wasted my money on this drug.

I can say that within 2 weeks or so I wasn't so despondent and bleak.   I actually can say that I became euphoric and felt there was more to life than justing working, eating and sleeping.  I began to notice that I became very hyper and almost manic.  I started to snap at my family and employees (I'm told more than usual), and develpoed palpitations, hypertension, ringing in the ears, dry mouth, frequent need to urinate, horrible neck, and upper back pain, and difficulty falling asleep (which is already a know cause for depression...imagine that!  I was cut fromm 300 to 150mg and noticed 50% less pain.  Two days ago I quit cold turkey (per my Dr), and I HAVE NO NECK PAIN ANYMORE!  What is also odd is that I still have a feeling of euphoria, but less anxiety.  Maybe I never needed the drug, it just could have been a rocky time in my life.  There is so much evidence regarding the placebo effect.  I hope that this is the case.  If my depression returns, I will believe that it was truly the wellbutrin than helped.  I am going to attempt Buspar for my anxiety.  I'll comment in a few months if anyone is interested.

I wanted to get away from the SSRI/SNRI meds so I suggested Wellbutrin to my doctor as an alternative. He had some reservations but started me on the 75mg immediate release Bupropion. One tablet for two days. No problems so the dose was increased to two tablets per day for the next ten days. At this point I was feeling a bit ""wired"" with some muscle twitches and difficulty sleeping. I believe these are typical with this medication. Also had a slight headache. Not real bad but always there. At this point I am wondering if this is the right medication for me. Feeling ""different"" but not really getting the relief that I wanted. I went to three tablets per day for about three weeks. Still having some issues at this point but I was seeing some benefits. Went to four tablets for the next ten days with much improvement.
   My most recent prescription was for Bupropion HCL 100mg taken three times a day. After about six weeks into this I feel much improved and confident that this medication will work well for me. Do not discount the effectiveness of this medication too quickly as there are some rough spots to get past before any benefit is seen.
   I did use low dose Klonopin to take the ""edge"" off the Bupropion. I did not need more than 1mg per day at the most and I am at a point where I believe I can stop it completely. The sleep issues have been resolved nicely with a 10mg dose of Doxepin at bedtime.
   Each individual is different as to the medications that work best. This is working for me.

My doc said to take 150mg each of the first four days, then 300mg per day. I didn't notice much of anything at all the first there days, but on the fourth day, I woke up at 4:00, feeling cranked up, then I thought I'd go ahead and take the fourth day's dose. That last dose was horrible. It felt like I had drunk a couple of posts of black coffee after missing sleep for about a week.

I troopered on and increased my dose to 300mgs, thinking I was just going through an acclimation period. Wrong! I had all the irritable side effects, the tinnitus, the insomnia. It was very similar to speed except without the horrible crash during the wearoff.

Finally, I called my doc and told her it was no good. She said I could cut the pills in half but that they would no longer be SR since the innards would be exposed. On the 75mg twice a day dose, sometimes I thought I was doing all right. But then the next day would be awful again, especially the insomnia. I cut the pills again, down to 37.5 mg twice a day, and I feel almost nothing except tinnitus and sometimes insomnia, but not as bad. There's no good side on this low dose, however. One good thing, unlike SSRIs, there's no ejaculatory disfunction on this drug. It even makes you sort of horny."

I had horrible side effects from the Bupropion- I felt drunk, sea sick, nervous, loss of appetite, couldn't sleep, woke up often in the night etc.  The 150mg/twice a day proved to be too much, and actually caused more anxiety than I started with. Sometimes going for a higher dose isn't the right answer. I went down to once a day dose of 150mg and it was magic! Together with celexa, I have gotten a hold of my depression/anxiety/OCD/PTSD. And, I have lost the 10 lbs I gained when first starting Celexa- yipee! If considering, or becoming discouraged with this drug- try out lower doses! Also- I'd suggest giving any SSRI medication at least 2 months to let the side effects wear off. I have absolutely no side effects now, and happy as can be!
102$Condition: Depression$4/10/2011 1:40:40 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$I started taking this 3 weeks ago for depression/anxiety. It really helped my concentration but it also kept me up all night every night that i took it because I had way too much energy. Also, if I had any caffeine, my heart would be pounding and my hands shaking to the point where it was embarrassing to try to hold a pen. I could definitely see this helping anyone for weight loss since I didn't want to eat anything even when I was hungry. But for anxiety, it made mine much worse. I also felt completely in my head and unable to control myself. I was having a difficult time controlling what came out of my mouth, which is scary in the office...i had to stop taking it. I do wonder if the non generic would have been better, but my insurance would only pay for the generic.

I do feel my mood overall is better, but i snap over smaller things, and I went from sleeping all the time to not being able to sleep back to sleeping alot not as much as before. Should i consider the name brand Welbutrin? im not sure this is all new to me, I do feel bettr, but still not Amazing by any means... not sure here :(

105$Condition: Depression$3/22/2011 12:27:04 PM$Reviewer: Leighann maines, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking Bupropion for little over a month (100mg 2x a day), and I have to say it has done wonders for me. I no longer have morbid thoughts or feel miserable all the time. I have noticed that when I'm close to my menstrual cycle I experience intense agitation, but aside from that I haven't experienced any other side effects. It has no sexual side effects at all which is fantastic. I'm so glad I've finally found something that works after taking every SSRI under the sun to no avail. My advice to anyone taking it is please wait a full month before you decide it isn't working (extenuating circumstances aside like if your suffering severe side effects then by all means consult your doctor) but I have felt better and better everyday since taking it. This has been my wonder drug and has given me my life back. I can concentrate better and have gotten my motivation back to pursue my personal goals in life. I hope everyone has the same results as I did. If you haven't don't give up there is something out there that can help you, and it is so worth it in the end.

Can say it definetly helps with the smoking. For the depression it is hard to tell. it gives me more energy but i am irratable and angry for no reason alot of the time and small things will just set me off now. Also have had bad ringing in ears periodiocally and can't stop clenching my jaw. finally realized what was making me do it.Bad dreams at night but might not be from this.

I haven't really noticed any big differences except this week would've been my BIG mood swing time of the month and I didn't have any. It is definitely cutting down my appetite which is great, as a result of my depression I was dwelling on situations and would eat or drink late at night and basically binge on snacks. I will take my 30 days dose and if I notice any bad side effects (like hair loss, ringing in ears as I have read on here) I will request to be changed to wellbutrin which who knows if my insurance will cover. I am going to Mexico in 2 weeks and they sell the brand name Wellbutrin for $100 a bottle with no prescription needed, I guess I will see if my insurance will cover it first. I've taken it in the past and my sex drive multiplied by 10 which was great as my depression had diminished my sex drive and general interest in anything. So far Buproprion hasn't changed sex drive but it's only been a week."

I just feel better. I am in less pain and no longer dwell on things for long periods of time. There was some feelings of agitation for a couple hours after taking a dose at first, but this passed after about two weeks. I sometimes have a light ringing in my ears, and I seem to get overly excited from time to time (a new feeling), a small price to pay for feeling better. Recommend starting with a very small dose and SLOWLY building up, that's what I did.

After a week of this medication, my doc wanted me to up the dosage to 2 pills daily. During my very first day of taking this medication I had adverse reactions.  My heart beat increased and I felt somewhat anxious.  Several days later I began taking the 2 pills per day as prescribed.  I noticed my neck began itching and had red blotchy spots appeared. Not only that but I became quite irritated and my husband said I was ""a bear"" while on this stuff. One of the most unpleasant effects was that I began ""clenching"" my teeth together and noticed an awareness in my teeth I'd never experienced before. This alarmed me so I called my dr's office. The nurse suggested I go back down to one pill again and come back in and see the doctor.  I have since been taking Sertraline (generic of Zoloft) with less adverse effects.  I have been on it now for almost 3 weeks and it's already much better than the Wellbutrin SR ever was.  The only good thing about this med is that it didn't have any bad sexual side effects...if anything it increased sexual desire.  But the bad far outweighed the good on this one."

This year when the weather turned cold I didn't like it but I didn't dwell on it. I find I don't dwell on stuff like I used too also. I'm taking 300mg a day and started with 100mg pills but found it to hard to remember to take it 3 times a day, so the doctor upped the pills to 150mg and taking it 2 times a day was much easier for me.

Now that I have stopped still have ringing in right ear and nerve pain. I went to er after 5 days on the generic Buproprion. Bad drug for me. Also, made me very angry which I am not naturally. The more expensive brand name slow release version works great so a doc. can write no substitutes as adverse reaction. Hope this helps others who suffer from depression. Above all please don't give up. Keep going to your doc to try something else as you will find right med for you.

I guess my beginning was uneventful, because I don't recall any adverse reactions. In retrospect, I did have vivid bad dreams and night sweats that I attributed to menopause. At my last check up my doctor suggested that maybe I didn't need this drug anymore. We tapered from 100 mg. a day to 100 every other day, t0 100 every third day.  I have not been on any for about two weeks.  Starting on the day I reduced I have had gastrointestinal symptoms I never expected-- slight nausea, severe diarhea, burning in the top left of my abdomen, extreme thirst, tiredness, a bit of a headache.  I don't really think there have been psychological withdrawal symtoms, except that I find myself thinking that what I really am feeling gastrointestinally are signs of some horrible fatal illness (anxiety?). So, this has been going on for about 4 weeks. Has anyone else had withdrawal symtoms like this?

I have been on several medications for depression and I have found that in my case it wasn't so much the drug as it was the dosage and combination of drugs.  Granted I have been diagnoses with major depression, as well as cancer, so the multi drug treatment isn't always for everyone.

Before Bupropion I was glued to my couch feeling bad for myself. I ramped up to 150mg before I really got motivated because I was also on Citalopram. With the motivation came high anxiety and clenching of my teeth which gave me headaches. I felt like I was on drugs all the time.

Finally, we reduced the Citalopram to 5mg, reduced Bupropion SL to 100mg and added a little (2.5mg)of Zyprexa.  Now I'm human again and I don't feel like I'm on drugs.

Warnings: Zyprexa has caused me to gain weight but worth not feeling like I'm on drugs. One last thing.  I've tried several drugs and none got rid of the ringing in my ears.  I just humm to it instead."

My health care provider prescribed it in addition to fluoxetine, which helped with my symptoms but made me feel drowsy and lethargic. On the bupropion (150mg SR in the morning) I couldn't sleep, I was jumpy, my brain felt like I was full of electrical zaps. I felt less inhibited, but this was actually a bad thing -- I didn't trust myself to know what was and wasn't appropriate to say or do. It was kind of terrifying, actually. I felt like I just wanted my self back. I can tell I would have lost weight quickly if I had stayed on it for any length of time. I was way overstimulated by it. Wished it had worked out, but it most definitely wasn't for me. Right now I'm on a very low dose of fluoxetine (10mg) to minimize side effects. Hoping to get off of it completely, but at least it helps when I need it without messing me up that much.

However, due to some of the side effects I am considering stopping it.  I have never been so angry in my life.  The smallest things set me off into a rage.  Im mean to my boyfriend and yell at my pets constantly. I feel like ripping out my hair at times.  I have never taken the brand name because I lack insurance.  Im not sure what to do.

My doctor said to switch back to my old depression meds. But I loved the way it worked for those 2 weeks, the best part was having a sex life again. Now I am thinking of spending the big bucks for the Wellbutrin ( no insurance for meds) Hopefully the improvements others here have found going off the generic form will work for me.

158$Condition: Depression$4/8/2009 9:56:53 PM$Reviewer: sexless, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$"I have had sexual side effects, but so far I can't tell how severe they may be as my body may still be adjusting to the drug. Initially, and still (after 2 months), I noticed that while I can reach a physical climax and ejaculate without any problem (unlike with Prozac where this had become difficult), the ""rush"" felt in the brain is missing -- no toe-curling reaction that leads to the afterglow feeling. More of a ""that's it?"", kissing your sister kind of feeling.

Recently, I have noticed a complete loss of libido - no interest in sexual stimuli that is usually a turn-on. I don't know if this is bupropion-related or not; I don't see sexual side effects listed at this website. In fact the reason I switched from prozac to bupropion was to reduce sexual dysfunction, which it has to some extent.

I wonder if anyone else has experienced these symptoms?"

On the fourth day I noticed a decrease in appetite and a bit of jitteriness.  I thought I might lose some weight!  That night I had a total meltdown.  While lying in bed trying to fall alseep, for no apparent reason I had the worst anxiety attack I have ever had.  I had the most horrifying and disturbing thoughts - things I am not capable of doing to those I love.  My husband sat up with me until I was finally able to sleep.  I stopped taking the drug immediately and felt better in a day or two.  It was extremely scary - felt like a ""bad trip"" I had once as a teen.  I won't take another anti depressant after that.  I don't know how drugs like this help people. "
164$Condition: Depression$1/1/2009 10:41:44 PM$Reviewer: SomethingsGottaGive, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$Well when takin alone, this stuff really works.  I tried every other drug before this one, and I must say this was the easiest for me to adapt to in regards to side effects.  However I was also givin Lorazepam with it which I ended up abusing and then even using alcohol and marijuana on top of it.  My advice would be to just take the bupropron sr alone with nothing else.  Alcohol and marijuana do not mix well with this.  I was feeling great after two weeks of taking this med but then started smoking pot again, and within 2 days I was back to my depressed self.  I stopped the lorazepam because I felt tired all the time and bupropion is supposed to make me wired, not tired.  So in the end, I realized to get better, I would have to ditch all my bad habits, and subtitute them with this drug, bupropion.  If you smoke pot or drink or do any other kinda narcotics, I would suggest not doing them at all if you truly want to get the full benefit of this medication.   
165$Condition: Depression$12/30/2008 1:30:46 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$3$1$I wanted to use this drug because I was depressed and also wanted to quit smoking. I used a generic non timed release and found I actually experienced withdrawal symptoms between doses. The only good thing I experienced was once I went through a few weeks of theses withdrawals between doses nicotene withdrawal seemed like a cakewalk. Even though I only used drug for a few weeks I have never had an urge for another cigarette and that was about 5 years ago.

When the SR and XL came out, I was switched to those and continued to do well. Now that BCBS won't pay except for generic, I went on Budeprion and had to double the dosage to get the same effectiveness. I never had panic attacks before but they started and I thought they were due to birth control pills I began taking to deal with bleeding problems. THEN, I did mail order and they gave me BUPROPION (not Budeprion) - it went rapidly downhill from there to the point where thoughts of harming myself occurred for the 1st time in years. Realized they gave me even the wrong generic - note the syllables - had to call my doc, the insurance, cuz it would've been $125. Still having problems with insurance cuz of mail order - never gonna do that again! I still have problems with any generic and wish the brand name was affordable.

One night I was looking around my living room for my kids, the next night I was cleaning the bathroom! This when on for 3 weeks. My husband started to hide the car keys at night so I wouldn't drive anywhere! I was having bad nightmares too. My doctor told me she didn't think this was a side effect but a few days after she took me off it I no longer had nightmares or sleepwalking. If you can't take actual wellbutrin I don't suggest taking this as a replacement!

Depression was 'much' better.  Ater about a year I noticed that the depression was getting bad again. Found out that my insurance company had my pharmacy substitute this new wellbutrin generic.  It DOES NOT work.  After getting back on the real wellbutrin I starting feeling better again.  A few months later I began feeling bad again and, sure enough, my insurance company had done it again.  I now have to make sure that my doctor writes ""do not substitute"".  It cost me more but is so worth it.  Bupropion should be FLUSHED."

I got progressively worse to the point that it nearly distroyed my fiance' and it had wrecked a few other relationships in its wake.  I had become this evil person, with anger, agression, short temper, and violent at times, which all was very unlike me.  So before it destoyrd me, we went back to my doc and got a once a day 300mg.  Just 2 days of it now, and i can feel me comiing back slowly.  I hold the hope that i can repair the dammages.

I have been on the drug for 2 years and during that time span, it's probably happened 10 times. The morning after I have had a drink or two, I will wake up in bed with the room spinning violently, feeling like I have been slammed onto the floor, and I have to get up and stumble dizzily to the bathroom in order to get sick. My doctor said that you can still drink while taking this medication, but that it will increase the effects of alcohol- so you feel drunker on less booze. However, the vertigo has increased ever since I increased my dosage to recover from S.A.D. Now, I've woken up with vertigo twice in the past week. I think I need to not drink any alcohol for a couple weeks to see if it gets better.

However, I am glad that I started taking it, because Bupropion has been very helpful in treating my depression and has allowed me to do better at work, as well as given me the energy to pursue the things I know I want out of life."

Within about 5 or 6 weeks these side effects subsided and I felt much better.  My doctor presribed a sleeping aid with it as well which helped with the insomnia.  I was able to wean myself off the sleeping aid after two months and have only had a few bouts of insomnia since.  The weight loss, increased sex drive and overall feeling of well being have been worth toughing my way through the side effects in the beginning.  I was on prozac for two years before this drug and I am most definitely thankful I switched to buproprion sr.

I still struggle with those feelings, but Wellbutrin XL (or the generic now) has helped immensely.  I'm on a 300mg/day dosage which I take in the morning.  It has allowed me to get past the feelings of worthlessness and near-paralyzing sadness.  

The only problems I've had with Wellbutrin is a reduction in my sex drive, an infrequent side effect of this drug. Maybe I'm just lucky.  I also highly recommend not stopping usage of this quickly.  I stopped for a couple weeks then started up again, only to have my internal chemistry sent into a tailspin.  For almost three weeks after, I had to deal with severe anxiety, sadness, depression, almost to the point where I needed to visit the local emergency room.  My system has since re-balanced, but I highly recommend not following in my footsteps.  Continue using or talk to your doctor before cessation.  "
