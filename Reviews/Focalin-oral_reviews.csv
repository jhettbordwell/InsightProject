I've tried generic methylphenidate, Adderall, Concerta, Daytrana, and Strattera. Focalin, at a higher dosage works great for me without any of the irritability I got from the others, minimal side effects. Taking xr 2x daily or 1x with non-xr as needed.

Last year I finally went to see a Dr and was put on Adderall. After 3 months it was a nightmare. I had so many ups and downs emotionally, as soon as it wore off I was worse off to begin with, I kept having to increase my dose. I switched to focaliN 
3$Condition: Other$5/19/2017 9:09:16 PM$Reviewer: Jiggity, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$5$This medication is powerful and not to be taken lightly. It does has side effects. As a 27 year old man with a technical career working on multi-million dollar machines this medication has helped me greatly. Downside as a married man is sex-life(it makes you feel naturally uninterested) and social life(you just don't care, I have a family and finances to run, the love is not gone just the empathy for the small things). Also there are at times, though rare, that you feel an impending doom...The impending doom I always realize at the time is false and it's just anxiousness but it does cause it some times. For me the benefits have really helped my career. It's been completely worth taking it. Learning faster and being more interested in tasks that my original self thought were mundane or would never of thought to pick up. It's helpful. I do plan to wane myself off of it and perform as normal but I feel it has helped my brain retain information and learn and take a interest in learning when I needed it most. Especially when it's your career and it's how you feed your family. Weird positive side effect it has made my bowel movements regular. Most negative weird side effect shortly after taking is gagging and or vomitting induced by my smoking tobacco habbit or eating. It makes eating breakfast very hard. Which is a shame.

He has gastrointestinal issues while on it that cause extreme gas. Secondly his eyes went from 20/20 vision to 20/50 vision that glasses cannot correct all within 18 months. This is one of the severe side effects. Please beware of putting your Child on this drug.I pray his vision gets better after stopping this drug.

Before i say anything bad about this drug, it does help with focusing..but almost helps too much. My grades improved dramatically when i started taking this, but my social life plummeted. I started feeling anxious, depressed and I couldn't really hold a conversation until the end of the day on the bus when it was wearing off. My parents didn't really see much difference in me because it wears off within the hour i get home, but yes, there is a huge difference (at least for me.) I don't recommend this drug to anyone who is creative and has a hyper lifestyle (Me.) It makes you a different person, almost zombie like because its hard to hold on just one social conversation. I think that was the main reason i didnt like it, all my friends were asking if i was sick or sad etc. and i would just say im not having a good day because its too hard to explain to them because i just dont have the motivation. luckily i only take this medicine on the weekdays and not on the weekends so im normal all weekend. Overall it just makes my life a little bit more hard to deal with because of my hyper, happy lifestyle....but it also helps with school. So its your choice. Do you want a more happy lifestyle and be social? or get better grades, but not be social whatsoever. I had to choose the not social way because of my grades, but because of so many conversations i have missed out on with my friends i wish i had taken another medicine. 
7$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/2/2015 4:28:30 PM$Reviewer: redheadok, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$My 6 y/o son was having many behavioral problems at his daycare. Basically he had daily incidents that led to phone calls for me to pick him up because they couldn't calm him down. I took him to a behavior therapist and after a month of visits and questionnaires completed by parents and teachers, he was diagnosed with ADHD + ODD. Although I strongly believe a large part of the problem was the adult's mishandling of the situation, when the ODD kicked in he was physical with anyone near and hurt (not seriously) people. At the recommendation of our pediatrician (who has known my 6 y/o son since birth) and the therapist, we started him on Vayarin and 5 mg of Focalin XR. We did notice a slight improvement with the 5 mg; however, over the course of the next 2 months we walked him up to 10 mg and then 15 mg. We always started a new dose on the weekend so we could monitor him closely. For the first 1-2 days he would have a headache, but it was nothing that prevented him from his normal daily activities. I do notice some excessive sweating and he often sleeps without his shirt because he's too warm. However, the benefits in his case have FAR outweighed those two cons. My child is NOT a zombie, which was a fear of ours before starting the medication. I notice immediately when the medicine takes effect and leaves his system. Multiple teachers at his school have raved about what a wonderful child he is. Now he can focus, complete tasks, and sit still for longer periods of time. I know his teacher has a great amount of experience with ADHD, so she has been incredible during this process. We also recently started behavior therapy at the CDC. My ultimate goal is to wean him off the Focalin XR; however, it has made a tremendous difference in our lives for the last few months. I have zero regrets for using it as a (hopefully) temporary crutch to help as we further develop his coping skills and work to decrease his impulsivity.

The medicine itself works great for attention, but oh god the side effects.
These are the side effects that i have, and i have been taking it for 8 years and it has caused many of these to be longlasting but overall i have mostly stopped due to them. Everything from lack of hunger, Anxiety, and depression has happened in extreme degrees. the anxiety expecially as i was so shy in  high school, one girl that i talked too when i finally stopped taking this stuff legitimatly thought i was a mute when she met me.

Summary:
It may work but at the cost of HORRIBLE anxiety and long lasting depression, i wrote this after a trigger from said depression over something minor that the depression was bad enough to remove my will to do anything for almost a hour. And this was all from one minor thing."

When you stop taking the OPINION of the prescribing doctor as anything more than an educated guess, you can resort to your own knowledge and experience. Loss of appetite means lack of nutrient intake, which our bodies need in order to function properly, i.e. our brains, without proper nutrition our brain cannot focus correctly, now for the HD side of AD/HD what is taken into the body is as important as how much, for instance, water over soda, less sugar loaded snacks (candy). These things combined with some quality adult interaction and intervention, appropriate disciple when needed, and a realistic expectation or individualism, and the opportunity to productively use excess energy that is different for every living thing and can't be lumped into an easy fix diagnosis called AD/HD and simply take a pill for it and alter the natural chemical process in the human body. AD/HD is one of the most over-diagnosed disorders to date because its easier to shove a pill down a kids throat than it is to be a parent.

17$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/14/2014 3:53:45 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$2$"I started taking Focalin for my ADD almost a month ago in place of Vyvanse, and prior to these I took Adderall. I am aware that our bodies’ can react differently to certain medications; luckily, being an adult allows us to better vocalize our reactions to these medications. With that said, of the three ADD medications, Adderall (hands-down!) worked best for me. However, my doctor has stopped prescribing Adderall due to its ""street value"". Therefore, I started taking Vyvanse instead and though it served its purpose, it simply wasn’t the same. Each day I had to take half of a capsule in the morning and the other around noon because taking all of it at once presented anxiety (which I was not accustom to) and when that would finally pass, I was left feeling exhausted. Although I was able to accommodate to Vyvanse, I felt as if my body (and wallet!) needed a change, so I did some research and talked to my doctor about Focalin.  My doc didn't know much about Focalin, but was intrigued by its description and prescribed it to me. I thought it would be OK at first, but I have come to realize that it is not. Much like my initial Vyvanse experience, I receive more jitters/anxiety side effects than I do actual concentration. Not to mention the intense urge to “break in” the nearest toilet...  I honestly feel this medication is doing more harm than help. Like I previously said, I know certain people react differently to medications than others; however, I can't help but feel concerned for those children taking Focalin and are experiencing similar side effects, but are unable to express them properly. With this, I would simply like for parents to be aware."

For my family this was a huge burden. They did not like how hyperactive I could be, but being energetic and creative is who I was. They had me take Focalin, for ADHD when I was 16, even though if you have anxiety you shouldn't take it. I told them I didn't like how it made me feel but they kept me on it anyways. They were desperate to calm me down and improve my grades. My grades improved but my mood plummeted. I had panic attacks every other day, became suicidal, cried in the hallways and was mean to my friends. When I tried to tell my parents this they said that I was behaving fine at home. I was a zombie at home! I sat around in bed and I slept, I lost fifteen pounds (to weigh a whopping 95 lbs at 5'5)They told me that my friends liked how hyper I was and that's why my friends agreed that this drug changed me. I told my doctor I no longer wanted to take it, and when he said that was okay my parents became very angry and suddenly decided he didn't know what he was talking about. I finally stopped taking it after six months. I have a lot of problems but I try to handle it as it comes. Talking to my doctor helps. But this medication was not for me. I had all the emotional side effects, but my parents were more concerned about what they considered my ""behavioral problems"". They wanted a zombie kid but I didn't want to be one, it made me want to die. I now live away from home and though I still have panic attacks now and again, and I still obviously get easily distracted, I understand myself and what I need better than they do. I do not recommend this drug for kids who are overly creative along with hyper, because it kills your creative abilities and turns you into someone else. I'm sure it works for some people and that is fantastic, but listen to your kid too. If they don't like it, try something else."

This pill does exactly what it's supposed to do, but he's a completely different child. He used to love to play and was always happy and smiling. Now, my husband and I only see him this way in the morning when he wakes up, and if we keep him up past his bedtime since the medication has worn off. He's a zombie. He doesn't smile much anymore, he can pay attention to you, but he looks empty. It's so heartbreaking. The only difference with him than the things I've read is that he doesn't have trouble sleeping, there are days he sleeps for 12 hours at night, and takes a 2 hour or more nap. I think if it were my choice, he wouldn't be on this. I miss the little boy that's locked up inside of him after he takes this.

This has gone on for two year; we just found our she has lymphoma hodgkin's cancer.  I have not done any research. It is my understanding that without the proper nutrition the body doesn't function properly and could it be possible that this medication assisted the cancer to grow. It obviously makes one lose appetite, therefore, it seems that the lymps don't function properly causing low immune system.

On our way day, he was telling me that he was seeing the civil war, Abraham Lincoln, the buildings on fire; he recognized that it could not be real, but they looked real to him.  When we arrived at the ER, they kept him 12 hrs under observation and sent us home with instructions not to take the Focalin anymore (of course).

I started taking Focalin around the time I was diagnosed and immediately noticed a difference. I became withdrawn, depressed, unable to carry a conversation with others, it became hard for me to sleep well, eat well, stay asleep, and so on. When I was younger I hated Focalin so much that I would spit it out before I left to catch me bus. Also, because it would ware off by the time I got home my parents never believed I was like a zombie. One day I decided to prove it and take it on a weekend so they could see. They were so concerned for me that they held a little intervention at the end of the day. At that intervention I told them that I took my Focalin and they didn't make me take it anymore. Around age 14 I decided I wanted to take it again. I hated Focalin more than anything else, however, my grades had slipped immensely and I needed help paying attention. After taking the Focalin for a month I was able to pass the classes I had been failing before. Now I'm getting straight A's. Still, after all of this, I find Focalin to be torture. An extremely effective form of torture. And now, I feel as though I NEED Focalin to function properly in society and be a better version of myself. Please, if your child is having any similar symptoms, find a new drug, or a new tactic. Don't let them end up like me.

I didn't tell her teachers so I could really see if they noticed a difference, and they immediately saw a change in her school performance.  She was less impulsive, she stayed on task, and she actually finished assignments!  At home she was able to do more things like getting dressed on her own, cleaning her room, doing most her own homework without me prompting her every five minutes.  We found that giving her half a pill in the morning and half at lunch (the school helps us with that) worked best for her (it seems to last 5 hours).   After school homework time was a challenge since the Rx had worn off, but her Dr. prescribed a 2mg dose as needed for these days, and it works really well.  She is still able to sleep by 8PM.  She still has a good appetite too (which worried me).  It is available in generic form so it's easily affordable. The only problem with this Rx is that it isn't long-acting so you need to give a booster dose mid day.  But we haven't found this to be difficult for now.  I hope this helps someone out there!  It has been a life-saver for our sweet daughter!

He was started on clonadine at night and tenex 2x a day. He was either a zombie or bouncing off the wall.As a parent it tore me apart. He was started on Ritalin and it helped but, Dr wanted us to try Focalin XL 10mg and it was a big help after a week or so of adjusting to it...He is now 7 yrs old he takes Foclain XL 15mg with tenex 2x aday and it has made a huge difference in his life.He still has to be reminded to focus but, teachers and I agree this med has helped turn his life around. last report card was 3 B's and all S's including great behaviour. Everyone is different so it will effect some negatively.Personally I'm glad I gave my son the chance to try it.

There has been noticeable improvement, but it wears off as the day goes on.  In the beginning she was extermemly moody and depressed, but this has tapered off.  Now that she has been on it for awhile it does not seem to be working as well and will need to be increased periodically.  The worst side affect is that she has began pulling out all of her eyelashes.  She becomes hyperfocused and almost obsessed with some activities.

It has had the least negative side effects and has no ""afternoon crash"" which I experienced with other medicines we tried first. 

It helps me listen when someone is speaking, be more productive at work, and has helped me feel calmer overall. 

I do think I will be upping to 30mg soon, as it is slowly becoming slightly less effective after several months, but overall I have been pleased with the results."

She only takes 1 dose of 5mg per day. This is the first and only med shes ever been on. It works great to keep her focused in school. But although it can be a challenge to help her focused without it, I refuse to give her any more, I deal with her behavior the best I can, because her physical health is of great importance. I read several comments and i truely believe that the dosage that most mentioned giving their kids is crazzy. Its great for school because teachers really dont want any more work than they have to. But as parents, lets find other ways to treat our kids than with narcotics, which is what these drugs are, legal narcotics.

I take the short acting generic version of Foclin. I can take it when needed, typically first thing in am, and then 4 hours later, with a 3rd dose if needed @4 more hours.  I like being able to control dose and not have to deal with too much wakefulness when bedtime comes around.

Very much able to concentrate and complete daily tasks with an ample amount of energy.

The first day I took it I felt that I actually wanted to do things,cleaning, homework, laundry.  I do all of those anyway but it's like I have to force myself.  I work full time and go to college full time. I do feel that it is helping a little.  I don't feel like I'm all amped up or anything. More like, clearer. The only side effects are very very mild.  Feeling not very hungry.  Which is fine by me, because I also take Welbutrin XL 300mg and Seroquel 400mg which made me gain like 30lbs in the last six months.  I'm still eating well. Just not allllll the time like before. I also noticed a sort of heavy feeling in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.  Not sure what that is about.  I'll be sure to ask my Dr about it though.  It usually only happens if I take it on an empty stomach.  But other than that I can't tell I'm taking it.  I was scared starting ADD medication because I hear alot of terrible things about being zombie like, mean, moody.. and so on.  So I'm going to stick with it and see how it plays out until my next appointment in a month.

151$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/23/2008 4:13:19 AM$Reviewer: Bert, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$"I am 39 years old and was recently diagnosed with Adult ADD.  After trying Stratera for a few days, my doctor changed me to Focalin 5 mg twice daily.  The Stratera did not work for me, made me very drowsey, wicked cotton mouth, upset stomach and the ever onmious ""sexual side effects""  but alarmingly it gave me very gruesome nightmares.  I've never had that happen before, so the doctor changed me to Focalin after only 4 days.

Wow what a lifesaver.  I'm currently in school fulltime because of a career change.  With the ADD I was unable to work and go to school at the same time, to the point where my parents offered to support me while in school.  The ADD was just too much for me to do both.  After only a few weeks, I can say that this drug has saved me.  Finally I can concentrate fully and not get distracted.  This has allowed me to start working again while in school, so I am extremely happy.

As for side effects, I've been pretty happy with the dose I'm on.  The only real side effect for me is loss of weight, which at my age isn't something I'm going to complain about too much! lol  I do have to remind myself to eat, and it's a weird sensation to go a whole day without eating and not be hungry.  It's amazing in that respect.  Other than that I have no complaints.

One last comment is regarding sleep problems.  I have suffered through many many sleepness nights because of the ADD.  It is not unusual for me to be up until 3 or 4 am everynight because I couldn't quiet my mind enough.  I take this drug twice daily, six hours apart.  In a roundabout way, Focalin has relieved the sleep problems, because by the end of the day I seem pretty well spent.  I workout 3 times weekly and I seem to have more energy now due to the Focalin.  The workouts and the Focalin ensure that I am dead tired by 10 pm.  This is a fast acting drug and I feel it within 5 minutes of taking it on an empty stomach.  It doesn't make me feel ramped up, I do have a lot of energy when taking it."

It has already been life-changing for me.  I am able to work from home for 8-9 hours per day and finish projects I would have never completed before.

He was originally prescribed Concerta XR.  He lost a tremendous amount of weight with Concerta and his behaviors got worse over time.  Our doctor prescribed Focalin XR 10mg a week ago today.  Our foster son is happy and excited about his accomplishments for the first time in his life.  His teacher has noticed a difference as well as our family.  He had gained some of his weight back and has an appetite again.  We are very pleased with this medication and our son is too!

I was given Ritilan first, and the pharmacy made a mistake and filled the script with Focalin. They called two days later to tell me....but it was a blessing really. Focalin XR works much better for me and so my doctor switched me onto it. Sometimes i get muscle cramping though.....that is the only draw back for me......but Ritilan did the same thing....and it had more side affects. I like Focalin better than the other ADD drugs.

I felt very anxious, sad, and self-concious while on it, and after reading teh allergic responses to it's main ingredient - Methyphenidate - I am clear now that my body does not react well with that chemical. I was even experiencing the other allergic reaction of small purple spots (like little bruises) whenever I was on Focalin. I highly, highly recommend Aderall XR - despite the minor insomnia, it is wonderful.

The one problem I see is that it quiets him to a point he seems shy and nervouse to people.  Focalin has given him the least amount of side effects and his grades are amazing.

Have been taking Focalin xr 5 mg in am and 5 mg pm; seemed to work for the first 2-3 weeks, now not so much. I also seem to be very sensitive to the ""ups and downs"" effect common with the use of extended release medicines. However, the best response I have is right after my morning dose; once that wears off, I pretty much fight a losing battle all day with the return of inattentiveness, distraction, and fatigue as the lower-end dosing 'xr' begins to fizzle out. My Dr. told me to wait for a while longer to see if things even out. Otherwise, he thought a higher dose of a shorter-acting medicine may be an alternate way to maximize symptom control and extend the morning's response throughout the remainder of the day."

All children need room to act out and learn from experience. Eating was much easier on Focalin than other stimulants, while they'll say they aren't hungry I can at least get them to eat something, ie fruit, cookies, cheese.
