I'm like a burn person were hands & feet had blisters, mouth sores, & nails almost pop out. Liver & kidney swells.Even liquid hardly pass thru your throat & was put on isolation room due to prone to infection. 

Now 7 months had passed, dark patches still covering my entire body. Looks like a dalmatian dog :P. 
Now I had developed massive food allergies & allergens. Only few I can eat
Bottom line, Thanks God Im still alive & that dark patchy skin i have wont define me. thank you.  "

Went to ER with agony. Given 200 mg Tegretol. It stopped the pain but has made me a zombie. I am 71 but very active, in school, play cello. Now I am a zombie and I feel like my life is over because I have to choose between crippling agony of TGN or being a zombie, and I have to choose zombie. My heart is broken. I am also depressed  now, never was before, and have gained weight, 5 lbs in one month.

I've had mild-moderate psoriasis for 45 years.  Within a week after starting Tegretol for mood disorder (probably) caused by traumatic brain injury 15 yrs ago) my skin was burning, most intensely on psoriasis patches but also on unaffected skin. Stopped taking it a few days ago but still I want to tear my skin off it itches so bad. 
I'm taking a number of other meds for psychiatric problems so not sure what interactions may or may not be in play. But the only thing that seems to make sense is starting Tegretol. So beware if you have PSORIASIS, but that may or may not be due to interactions with meds. "

Lately though I've had breakthrough of the medication and have experienced waking up in the middle of the night with strong feelings of seizure activity, (i.e feelings of convulsing of my brain with copious amounts of drool and feelings of confusion for a couple of days after, memory loss, etc.) I plan to see my internist to see what he recommends for me. I am returning for a Tegretol blood test on Monday 6/22/15. Will update this entry once I have more information.

After this my neurologist changed my prescription to Keppra and after some experimenting with dosage, in the space of two years my seizures have become almost completely controlled by my medication. Tegretol was the worst drug I have ever had the misfortune of being prescribed, my experience has been nothing but distress and increased seizures.

I called my Dr and was told this was not a side effect. I continued this medication. I started vomiting a few days later with higher fever. I ended up in the hospital for ten days with hepatitis and panceritis. I also had a terrible rash that itched and had large raised areas. I almost died. I then developed c diff from the antibiotics and went back in the hospital for another five days. If it had not been for my local internist taking care of me instead of my neurologist from a large medical center I had previously consulted I would be dead now. If you start any symptoms stop this medicine ASAP.
 If my neurologist had advised me correctly I would have not had this bad experience.

Within three days I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, dizziness, wobbly on my legs, weird eye movements - seemed like each eye was bouncing around independently, and couldn't focus my eyes, but the constant pain was somewhat diminished, for the first time in almost a year and stabbing attacks almost disappeared. Had to cut dose back to 25mg twice a day due to side effects (which brought pain back) and increase by 50mg/day weekly until up to 600mg/day. This dosage just about eliminated stabbing pain and reduced constant pain to tolerable level except for exacerbations, but Dr was hesitant to increase. He added Lyrica which helped a little more, but over past 6 months pain has continued to increase. Just had dosage increased to 800mg daily and experiencing minor side effects again, but pain is easing somewhat. Hope to tough it out and pray for more pain relief. Constant gnawing face pain is becoming unbearable.

I have not had any panic attacks, but still have minor very short episodes of being snappy if provoked and tearful.  One minor short episode of dissociation.  Nothing like I am capable of by history. I have had some unusual tiredness,  minor what I call ""the dropsies"", mild to moderate sexual dysfunction (desire and orgasmic difficulty), a little weight gain,and moderate itching. The itching will most likely be the reason if I stop taking it.  I sometimes feel like I'm having low blood sugar, and when I eat it goes away.  I haven't seen this mentioned as a SE.

45$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$7/20/2012 4:09:29 PM$Reviewer: Marian, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$"It is now 10 years I am taking Tegretol and up to 85-90% of my facial nerve pain is under control. Having tried all the neurological medication there is this is the most effective. I needed several weeks to get used to the medication. To control dizzyness, sickness etc. I eat shortly before taking a dose. Rush and difficulties with muscle coordination I mainly have when I had to take a rather high dose. After a few years I was able to reduce the daily dose from 800 mgr to 200 mgr and that is just enough to stay ""good"" and it cut the rush. Indeed, symptoms like a dry mouth, a little bit too less natrium in my blood, feeling more tired then I should be based on my job and other wellknown, I have to live with. Careful use, knowledge about the medicine, a regular life are important. I am hardly taking any alcohol because that triggers the pain and the rush. And every single other prescribed and non-prescribed medicine I need to take, I have checked by the doctor or pharmacy if it might affect the function of Tegretol. Surprisingly many can affect Tegretol, even when I was taking only 100 mgr. Since I took non checked anti-biotica against a blatter infection 5 years ago, I had a severe pain break through, had to be taken to hospital for several days. After that event I am back at 200 mgr daily. Of course if I could I would do without Tegretol. But as long as there is not a better replacement, or even better, a solution for facial nerve pain I guess I have to stick to this. "

Now it doesn't affect me at all. I take about 1000-1200mg per day.I was stable on 200mg per day for years until recent flare-up. Much nicer drug than Neurontin-that made me listless and in a daze with high dosage and I never adjusted to it. Topamax made me stupid, literally.Had to stop taking, couldn't do simple add/subtract, and forgot names of things(that never got back to baseline-grrrr)Tegretol is the one for me. Old tried and true inexpensive medication.

Then was reintroduced back to it again (?) in spite of the allergy warnings from years earlier, in the 1990's; just doubled it up where Tegretol was moved up with Red Alert Warning in allergic reactions, not just side-effects.

Did absolutely nothing to control seizures, in fact, when the titration increased, so did the seizures on the EEG's - both eras."

There was no generic at the time but when one came out I tried it and it didn't work nearly as well so I had to go back on brand name. 10 years later I tried the generic again due to cost and it works just fine now. Still having petit mal activity occasionally and now new sleep problems. I keep waking up between 2:30-4am. I can go right back to sleep but then I wake up...vicious cycle. Neuro is now trying to determine if I'm having breakthrough activity and wants to try a new drug. He suggests Lamictal or Keppra so I'm researching now. Have a sleep study next week because a recent EEG showed possible seizure activity and to rule out sleep apnea as a factor. I hate taking meds but meds are better than seizures so hopefully I can find one with the fewest side effects. Will post back after I've been on new meds for awhile.

I need a higher dosage to cope better with my anxeity attacks but worried at the same time what this kind of effect might have on me as far as me being more confused, memory loss and distracted. I do however have no problem with these complaints its my fiancee who hates it. Though sometimes I feel stupid cause I can't even remember a simple date like my own birthday or my sons. Or for that matter answering a question thats very easy like whats your age. My anxiety however has been more under control then what it was before i was even taken this So in other words I do like this drug. I can't take anti-depressents because they do the oppisite for me. I become violent and very mean and snap at everyone so this is the drug for me. Just wish i didn't get confused or memory isn't all there most of the time.

I stayed on it for about 3 months and stopped it on my own.  I figured if my facial pain had gone away, I no longer needed it. A couple months later, my pain came back. I had tingling in both hands associated with this. My general doctor sent me to a neurologist. He put me back on Tegretol and I have been neausiated every day. I bought some phenegran on the internet. It helped some. My neurologist said it would go away but it hasn't. I still have to take the phenegran with this medicine. That is just not right. I would love to go off this drug, but the Trigimeal Neuralgia is too severe. It is the worse pain i have ever experienced. So, I guess I will just have to be neausated or in pain. Which is the worse of the two evils? Face Pain!  Tolerate the Tegretol at night if I have phenegran in the morning.

But besides that, I'm pretty happy with the medication.  Doctor prescribed 200mg twice a day, but I'm only taking once a day b/c I do not like to rely to med. I still have slight numbing pain, which is tolerable compared to what I was experiencing and the pain occur less than before.  Neurontin worked well for me, but made me gain weight, lost memory, blur vision and slur of speech.  Topomax made me lose weight, depressed,lose memory and slur speech.  So far, Tegretol seems to be the answer to my trigeminal neuralgia problem.

It has worked great for controlling my seizures (I have had no seizures while on it in 15 years). However, I am not a fan of taking any medications on a daily basis. Recently I had a dr. appointment and had to get a bone density scan because tegretol is now linked to osteoporosis (have not received my results yet). I haven't noticed any major side effects but I have seen a slight decrease in my passion/excitement/energy for things in everyday life. It also seems to have slowed my metabolism. I work out vigorously 6 days a week and eat pretty healthy as I am trying to lose about 10-15 pounds but am only losing about 1 pound per week (I am sure there are other factors that play into this but feel the tegretol plays a role as well). My personal thoughts, if you have a serious seizure disorder; take the medication it has worked great for me. If it is a mild disorder; try to find some other non-medicated remedy (this is my situation and I wish I would have found an alternative remedy to medication but I was 15 when I started and didn't know any better). I fear it is too late for me to stop now. Good luck to whomever reads this and I hope it helps!

I am going mental!  It feels like I'm high all the time and dizzy and drowsy, all I want to do is sleep.  It really is hard to function, in fact I am not able to work either because I am afraid of making a lot of mistakes and dealing with money that is not a good thing.  The doctor and other people I know dealing with this sort of thing tell me wait 5 days to feel better.  They keep insisting it will get better, well it's taking a long time to reach five days! Oh, yeah I have to take this three times a day, to me it seems excessive, but I'm no doctor.  I'm really hoping for a good outcome, no wait a great outcome!  See, I'm taking this because I have complex partial seizures do to scar tissue from my brain tumour being almost removed.  That's how they found the tumour, from having seizures.  I was fine for a few months, of course until the scar tissue started to form and grow, and now I'm having too many seizures per month.  So, something needs to be done.  I hope this is my amost cure, I will stay in touch, and hopefully I'll be ableto inform people it's working, and I'm seizure free, I really need some good news!

However I was tried on it, quite some time apart, 3 more times.  By the 4th attempt it stopped my spontaneous and triggered pain and I had no side effects.
I had to stop due to a bad white count but because I was sick at the same time it was not known if this was from a vius or the drug.  As a result I was told to stop taking it.

Now  if levels get high and I need to decrease dose, I go slower even 1/2 tab at a time.

I would of thought the adderall would of counter acted any of the sedation affects of tegretol but so far it has no affect at all Over all I do feel much better taking tegretol but hate these two side affects I’m currently experiencing. .

Taken in conjunction with Zoloft. Have noticed the Tegretol definitely helps lessen my disfluent speech, but I need to take it AFTER eating (Tegretol occasionally causes GI symptoms & lowers my blood sugar more if taken before eating). Also, I have noticed it is VERY IMPORTANT to get enough sleep each night to reduce the chance of having seizures.

It was working very well to relieve the pain.  But then I developed a nasty rash, first around my knees, then up my legs, arms, neck and face.  Dr. had me stop taking tegretol immediately, saying that the rash could be life-threatening.  I was broken-hearted to go off tegretol because it provided the first relief from pain that I'd had in years.  I'm on gabapentin now, but it just does not relieve pain well, and I'm gaining weight despite daily exercise and a lowfat diet (7 pounds in 8 weeks.)

To the person who posted ""I actually passed the pill in my stool after 12 hours for a 24 hr extended release"": What you passed in your stool after 12 hours was the shell/casing, not the pill itself. And each pill lasts 12 hours, not 24. That is why you take it twice a day instead of once. Hope this helps someone with the same concerns. :-)"

When I realize that I'm manic, I treat the symptoms by taking a walk to release increased energy & journaling to purge myself of racy thoughts. I still cycle about every 2 weeks, and I have terrible problems with irritablity & anger management. Whether manic or depressed, its all about self-care. Before taking tegretol, I was in a state of constant chaios because I didn't understand what was happening with my mind. I thought I was either going crazy or just being carefree; I couldn't understand why I couldn't keep a job and such. The only side effect I feel I have is fatigue. Tegretol does not do alot to control my manic-deppresive episodes; there are times I feel like I could crawl out of my skin, my head reels, and things seem so surreal or I get so depressed that I don't get out of bed for a couple of days feeling catatonic. Like I stated before, the tegretol does help me identify my mood swings somewhat and that helps.
