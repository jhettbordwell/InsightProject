0$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/27/2019 12:05:39 AM$Reviewer: KT, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$I took 30 mg for a couple, and then upped to 60 mg for about 6 months. It was the first time I have been relieved of my depression for 10 years. It also managed to help with some anxiety and my migraines! It did wonders for me, but I had to come off of it due to rather being depressed, I was bipolar. So the medication wasnt fit for the job. But what it did was great!
1$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$11/19/2019 8:17:24 AM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking this medication for two months and the improvement in my mood, level of pain, sleep, etc. has been amazing. I dread coming off of it as I see that withdrawal symptoms are terrible. I couldn't get off 20 mg. of Prozac without serious symptoms. Even knowing that there will be hell to pay if I have to come off of this, I feel so much better I am taking that risk. I hope it doesn't stop working.
2$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$1/20/2019 1:29:35 AM$Reviewer: Retired old crazy cat lady, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I suffer from osteoarthritis and major depressive disorder.  After 11years on paxil, and having read the possible benefit of pain reduction, I asked doctor about changing.  I stepped down from Paxil, while starting duloxetine on small dose then increasing as Paxil was phased out.  It's like night and day!  My depression is no longer controlling my life!  I don't think there is any difference in pain control, but I hate to think how bad it would be without it.  I believe my body had become immune to or adjusted to the Paxil so much that it was no longer effective. Other than some sweating at night, I have no side effects.  I am a content person now and no longer dread social situations.
3$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/15/2018 8:29:01 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$"This is honestly the worst drug anyone could ever take. I took 60mg of Duloxetine for over 5 years and had to come off it for surgery. 
I was initially prescribed it by a psychiatrist and left on it for so long because my GPs didn’t know what it was or what it did. Admittedly, it did the job and helped a lot with my depression and anxiety, but it wasn’t worth it for the withdrawal symptoms I suffered with. 
Do not take this drug long term - you will never be able to come off it. The withdrawal is absolutely horrendous. I actually thought I was having a seizure at one point. I had absolutely no choice but to come off it because it isn’t available in liquid form. If I wasn’t having surgery, I’d have taken it again in an instant to stop the awful withdrawal effects.  
I have been reading lots about this drug and feel I have to warn people. There have been many lawsuits against the manufacturer because coming off it is likened to coming off speed. The withdrawal can last years for some people. 
I can’t even describe how awful it is trying to come off this drug. I honestly thought I was going to die. I had flashes of electricity through my brain every couple of minutes that rendered me totally unable to do anything. My head was fuzzy, I had awful dreams and sweats, I had stomach upsets and just a terrible feeling of paranoia. 
I have been off it for six months now and I was lucky that the withdrawal effects stopped after around 2 months.
Please, please, please be aware before taking this drug - stopping it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life. I wish I’d known about it before I started taking it. "

I don't want to sleep all the time. I have a renewed interest in life, including love making. My hot flashes and bladder spasms all but went away. My memory and brain function is so much better! People were starting to think I had early onset dementia. No, just depression, thank goodness. I feel normal for the first time in 9 months after my concussion.

14$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/11/2014 10:03:54 PM$Reviewer: Noon, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$Brand (Lilly) had been better at treating depression related to pain, 30 mg twice per day. Generic (Teva) doesn't seem to manage my depression as well, but Lilly has increased their pricing so I had to switch. Overall, Cymbalta, was prescribed as a dual purpose medication and it's effective enough to deal with both.
15$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/14/2014 2:55:28 PM$Reviewer: Jeff, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$2$5$"I switched from 90mg/day Cymbalta to 90mg/day Duloxetine.  The Duloxetine is just not as effective.  Duloxetine 90mg feels like Cymbalta 60mg.
I suspect the dosage might not be consistent because sometimes I experience symptoms of a missed dose - disturbing vivid dreams and anxiety.

I've had constant bladder burning, two bacterial vaginal infections, now on yeast because of that.  I'm just wondering if this is going to work for me.  The difference in cost is unreal, but does it have side effects?  I also have Intersitial Cystitis.

Was diagnosed as also having anxiety disorder. Duloxetine prescribed, 30mg initially increased to 60mg after 4 days. Have had nearly all listed side effects, although feeling almost 100% better mentally, am physically incapacitated by chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, uti symptoms, faintness, nausea, hot and cold sweats. Psych has reduced dose to 30mg till review in a few days to try another drug treatment. This one obviously doesnt agree with me physically, Im so disappointed! :( Desperate to feel better soon!"

Cymbalta has been the only drug to help me and also has worked for my father and sister.  I does however, make me very tired at times.  Otherwise, I have had very little in the way of side effects.  Make sure you do not miss any doses because coming off of it is hard.

Especially after a week or so, I felt 1000% better!  If you can take this drug, it is wonderful !  I have not had any side effects except maybe a little sweating during the night, but that might be from the onset of menopause, not sure, anyway, small thing to have to deal with considering the benefits of this med. I strongly recommend it! I have fibromyalgia and depression.... and it works wonders for me !  Best of luck and God Bless !

38$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/10/2008 9:18:13 AM$Reviewer: Jenni, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month$1$1$1$"After approx. 1 wk on Cymbalta, major episode of rt. hand swelling twice the size, fingers w/ no feeling, brown/red/blue ""leather-looking"" skin with a large, pulsating lump that appeared in the center of the hand, stretching the skin as it grew before my eyes within 10 minutes! A very dangerous drug with 35+ side effects that people don't know about unless they search to find real-life experiences & studies done not only in the U.S., but other countries. This lasted 2-1/2 wks; there are reported experiences of swelling of the THROAT in which you must get medical attention immediately--I was ""lucky"" & immediately stopped using. People should always research (on sites other than the drug's site) all possible side effects & consider asking for something far less invasive. My hand literally looked like a monkey's paw & was Not Usable for weeks. I still do not see this particular reporting in the advertisement literature--just ""swelling."" That is an understatement. Be your own best advocate so you will lower the incidence of some of these frightening results. Many of the anti-depressant drugs/anxiety stay in your system even after you stop. Take time to read what other people have experienced & less on ""a few people experienced..."" in ads. I had no prior history of anything of this nature, so it can happen to anyone. There are many excellent drugs (older drugs) that work much better under supervision. Thank you."

The sweating is easily treated with antipersperant.  The bowel changes are tricky.  I'm constipated and irregular.  Neither much fun.  Overall, it's worth it for me to feel better.
