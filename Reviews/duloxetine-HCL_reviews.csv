1$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/27/2019 12:05:39 AM$Reviewer: KT, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$I took 30 mg for a couple, and then upped to 60 mg for about 6 months. It was the first time I have been relieved of my depression for 10 years. It also managed to help with some anxiety and my migraines! It did wonders for me, but I had to come off of it due to rather being depressed, I was bipolar. So the medication wasnt fit for the job. But what it did was great!

The neuropathic pain event I had after taking the capsule was far worse than any neuropathic event that I have had. I felt like I was having a heart attack-fast heart beat, hard to breath...and my hands turned really red. Maybe an allergic reaction? 
4$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$11/19/2019 8:17:24 AM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking this medication for two months and the improvement in my mood, level of pain, sleep, etc. has been amazing. I dread coming off of it as I see that withdrawal symptoms are terrible. I couldn't get off 20 mg. of Prozac without serious symptoms. Even knowing that there will be hell to pay if I have to come off of this, I feel so much better I am taking that risk. I hope it doesn't stop working.

After 11years on paxil, and having read the possible benefit of pain reduction, I asked doctor about changing.  I stepped down from Paxil, while starting duloxetine on small dose then increasing as Paxil was phased out.  It's like night and day!  My depression is no longer controlling my life!  I don't think there is any difference in pain control, but I hate to think how bad it would be without it.  I believe my body had become immune to or adjusted to the Paxil so much that it was no longer effective. Other than some sweating at night, I have no side effects.  I am a content person now and no longer dread social situations.

12$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/15/2018 8:29:01 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$"This is honestly the worst drug anyone could ever take. I took 60mg of Duloxetine for over 5 years and had to come off it for surgery. 
I was initially prescribed it by a psychiatrist and left on it for so long because my GPs didn’t know what it was or what it did. Admittedly, it did the job and helped a lot with my depression and anxiety, but it wasn’t worth it for the withdrawal symptoms I suffered with. 
Do not take this drug long term - you will never be able to come off it. The withdrawal is absolutely horrendous. I actually thought I was having a seizure at one point. I had absolutely no choice but to come off it because it isn’t available in liquid form. If I wasn’t having surgery, I’d have taken it again in an instant to stop the awful withdrawal effects.  
I have been reading lots about this drug and feel I have to warn people. There have been many lawsuits against the manufacturer because coming off it is likened to coming off speed. The withdrawal can last years for some people. 
I can’t even describe how awful it is trying to come off this drug. I honestly thought I was going to die. I had flashes of electricity through my brain every couple of minutes that rendered me totally unable to do anything. My head was fuzzy, I had awful dreams and sweats, I had stomach upsets and just a terrible feeling of paranoia. 
I have been off it for six months now and I was lucky that the withdrawal effects stopped after around 2 months.
Please, please, please be aware before taking this drug - stopping it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life. I wish I’d known about it before I started taking it. "

I slipped and fell 9 months ago and  been dealing with a herniated disc, multiple annular tears, and a pats defect fracture everyday since. IÃ¢Â?Â?ve never been depressed in my life until about 6 months ago when I realized how long the recovery would be and how much ithe one fall turned my entire life upside down. I was crying daily (sometimes multiple times) and started havingsevere and uncontrollable anxiety everyday. I was also in chronic pain all through my spine and right side of my body. This medication Is literally saving me right now. My mood has improved and I have only had a few breakdowns (crying episodes), which have all been triggered by me seeing my now ex partner (he ended things with me a few months ago after many years). So - this medicine is great! Only side effects seem to be loss of appetite and also more prone to bruising (I have always been - but now is worse). No loss of sexual drive, no drowsiness, and no loss of focus or energy. My mind feels more clear than it has in a long time.

Works great.  Takes about 3 weeks before the benefits are fully realized but you can feel the difference within the first day.

I had serious, awful anxiety that felt completely out of my control. I did therapy for 6 months with no change before being sent to a psychiatrist. The first few days were hard as I felt irritable for seemingly no reason. About the first week in I felt like ""not myself"" although I couldn't explain past that. I just felt... weird. 2 weeks in I realized I didn't feel like myself because I wasn't anxious and my mind was finally free to think about other things. It's been a year later and my anxiety is still very low. Rarely, I have times where I feel anxious still but it's nothing like it was before: hours and hours each day thinking anxious thoughts that I couldn't stop, countless times crying over nothing, asking my family for reassurance daily, etc. No more. I feel like a completely different person now. "

She prescribed Duloxetine which I have taken for at least 8 years.  It has been the most effective medication to date. With the help of a clinical psychologist there are only 2 months per year that I consider low periods.  I will revisit my therapist before those months. I have been in and out of psychological therapy and psychiatric care for 20 years.  I would like to tell others to not give up or be satisfied with minimal quality of life. I worked with 3 other psychologists before I worked with my current one.  Only one of those psychologists was not a good match. The other two had to give up practicing for health reasons.  We moved to another city, but I am close enough to see the therapist I have worked with for about 10 years. I only see her when I need a fine tuning. I am currently looking for a new psychiatrist in the city where we live because my previous doctor retired.

A follow-up with a rheumatologist quickly resulted in a fibromyalgia diagnosis and increase to 60mg duloxetine (also meloxicam for pain, tramadol for sleep, and klonopin for anxiety). I slowly improved with physical therapy in addition to the meds. After about 5 months I had weaned off the Rx meds except for duloxetine (60mg daily) and meloxicam (as-needed). At this point I am experiencing some troublesome side effects from the duloxetine - mainly increased insomnia (lorazepam a couple times a week helps) and severe episodes of constipation. Also, changes in hair growth and difficulty w/ orgasm. I will be slowly reducing (but not stopping) my dosage to try to reduce side effects while maintaining the gains I've made. The plan is to reduce to 50mg, then 40mg and even 30mg if necessary.
BOTTOM LINE: While this is not a miracle drug for fibromyalgia, it has certainly played a part in my recovery. Benefits vs. side effects should be closely monitored by the individual (in concert with advice from their docs) to achieve an optimal balance that the individual can live with. Best wishes to all of you dealing with these difficult issues."

Previously, celexa and prozac, both of which i felt had stopped working after a while. I was given Duloxetine for Major depressive disorder/panic disorder/chronic pain. I would not recommend this drug to ANYONE suffering from depression/anxiety. I was crying over everything from commercials to someone asking me to do something for them and MORE. No reason at all and I would be sobbing hysterically. On top of that I had horribly invasive thoughts, not suicidal, but things like  ""what would happen if I were to just run the red light instead of stopping?"" I physically could not make myself smile because I felt there was no reason in the world to smile at all. Horrible drug, I begged my doctor in tears to take me off it after 6 weeks.

My dr. did not change me from cymbalta, the cvs drug store took it upon themselves without warning to change me to the duloxetine. not to mention the mental shock and increase pain, I would never want another person to be so abruptly changed from cymbalta which provide a degree of pain relief to duloxetine which is a shock when you feel so much pain and like you have been given a pill to stop depression.

Especially after a week or so, I felt 1000% better!  If you can take this drug, it is wonderful !  I have not had any side effects except maybe a little sweating during the night, but that might be from the onset of menopause, not sure, anyway, small thing to have to deal with considering the benefits of this med. I strongly recommend it! I have fibromyalgia and depression.... and it works wonders for me !  Best of luck and God Bless !

Overall, try something else. Take care when reducing/ending medication. Use close doctor supervision.
129$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$10/5/2008 1:25:57 AM$Reviewer: sharx, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have tried so many other things during my life to try to get my depression under control. This is the only medication that has ever helped me. I call it my miracle drug, and that is an understatement. I have been taking this for over three years now and I am grateful everyday that there is something that helps me. 
130$Condition: Disorder characterized by Stiff, Tender & Painful Muscles$8/30/2008 10:52:23 AM$Reviewer: 515lady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$female, 60, on Cymbalta for 3 mths. 60 mil twice daily, along w/tramadol 50 mil 3 daily & neurontin 300 mil once daily, for pain & depression for fibromyalgia; also take zolpidem 10 mil at night to sleep. It took me a while to find the right combination of medications that would work for me. I had gotten so racked w/pain that I could hardly get out of bed to go to the bathroom, took very hot baths in the heat of the SC summers to releive the pain in my legs, would lay with heating pads on my shoulder, back & legs (both front & back) for pain relief as well. I have always eaten a very well balanced diet w/lots of fruits & veg, fish, chicken, some pork, & very little beef, and a vit. & supplement regime since I was a very young woman. I have maintained my weight & have exercised at least 3 times weekly, (weights, stretching, swimming indoors, walking)throughout my life. To be struck by this weird disease and to look the picture of health has had me baffled. The worst now is the relentless fatigue I feel daily. I begin my day thinking I can do as much as I have always and in a very short while I am over come w/fatigue and must sit or lie down before tackeling another house hold project. I have not worked for months or driven my car (six speed standard) for fear of not being able to depress the clutch! I believe I am improving but I also have noticed that a low pressure weather system with rain will affect my pain level quite a bit. I believe the Cymbalta was the key that started me on the path to finding which medications would help me. I am loathed to think how long I must be on these medications since all are very expensive, but for the forseeable future, this looks like what my life is.
131$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/10/2008 9:18:13 AM$Reviewer: Jenni, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month$1$1$1$"After approx. 1 wk on Cymbalta, major episode of rt. hand swelling twice the size, fingers w/ no feeling, brown/red/blue ""leather-looking"" skin with a large, pulsating lump that appeared in the center of the hand, stretching the skin as it grew before my eyes within 10 minutes! A very dangerous drug with 35+ side effects that people don't know about unless they search to find real-life experiences & studies done not only in the U.S., but other countries. This lasted 2-1/2 wks; there are reported experiences of swelling of the THROAT in which you must get medical attention immediately--I was ""lucky"" & immediately stopped using. People should always research (on sites other than the drug's site) all possible side effects & consider asking for something far less invasive. My hand literally looked like a monkey's paw & was Not Usable for weeks. I still do not see this particular reporting in the advertisement literature--just ""swelling."" That is an understatement. Be your own best advocate so you will lower the incidence of some of these frightening results. Many of the anti-depressant drugs/anxiety stay in your system even after you stop. Take time to read what other people have experienced & less on ""a few people experienced..."" in ads. I had no prior history of anything of this nature, so it can happen to anyone. There are many excellent drugs (older drugs) that work much better under supervision. Thank you."
132$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$3/9/2008 11:20:30 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Two drawbacks: increased sweating and bowel changes.  The sweating is easily treated with antipersperant.  The bowel changes are tricky.  I'm constipated and irregular.  Neither much fun.  Overall, it's worth it for me to feel better.
