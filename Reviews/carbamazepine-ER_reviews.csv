1$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$5/15/2019 12:09:55 PM$Reviewer: Lara, 65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"My Trigeminal Neuralgia started in 1996 as the result of a severe undiscovered infection caused by a corroded silver pin used during a root canal when I was 11 years old.(I am a language teacher and singer, and went through some excruciating days, using ice packs, heat, etc.)  Doctors just kept wanting to give me pain killers and all the dentists I went to, kept telling me they could see nothing wrong.  Meanwhile, the abscess was eating through my jaw bone.  After it was finally big enough to be discovered, about 10 - 12 months,(and x-rays got more precise) and the abscess was taken care of,  it went away for 20 years. I then moved and found a new dentist who did NOT LISTEN to me!  He made a night guard for the wrong area of my mouth and the TGN started again. Had two very severe attacks in 2017 and I have been using  Carbamazepine as needed when I feel twinges.  I have been very lucky.  I want to let you know about an organic essential that was introduced to me in a health/natural store. You roll it on the outside of the area causing the pain and I have found it to be extremely helpful.  It is VERIDITAS by Pranarom and is called: Just Plain Relief.  Yes,  that's  Plain (with an ""l"").  I take two 200 mg grams of Carba... twice a day and if I do get a spasm, I roll this on.  I find it very soothing and considerably helpful.  I certainly hope you find the right combination that will work for you.   "

3$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$8/6/2018 2:01:57 PM$Reviewer: Troy, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Was experiencing 120 volt-like pain stabs for a while which transferred to 2-5 minute attacks. It was like my own body was electrocuting itself. Carbemazepine at 200mg a day did nothing.  It took 400 mg a day to finally get it under control. I am going to a Dentist today in hopes of extracting a tooth that may be pressing on the nerve.  I am not looking forward to the surgery options. All in all, the Carbemazepine did save my sanity for the time I have been on it. I could actually function as a normal human being this last week. God Bless (or whatever higher being you believe in) if this is happening to you. I would not wish this on my worst enemy.  The medication did work wonders though, but, it is not a final solution.

Didnâ??t work. 8 yrs later had the Gamma Knife because i was having a lot of pain even with the meds. So I took the chance and it worked. I have been pain free for 1 yr and 2 months. The medicine did work gor me. And the highest dosage I took was 1000 msg per day. But like all medicines there are side affects. I was feeling depression and at times suicidial but I never attempted to do anything so drastic. Because the pain of TN has been know to cause that. I never gave up and I hope this helps someone and gives them hope. I will try gamma knife again if the pain comes back. But the meds did work. 
5$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$4/26/2018 10:09:12 PM$Reviewer: mnicholson123, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$2$I am 28yrs old and have had constant face pain for four years. Just recently acquired insurance, and went to the local urgent Care. Doc there tells me go see a neurologist. Neurologist says you have trigeminal neuralgia and gives me 600mg of gabapentin 3 times a day, and 200mg of carbamazepine 3 times a day. The pain gets dulled away, but some days I can feel it leak through the medication and ruin my life. My wife hates those days. I went to an ENT and he says get your septum fixed and it'll help. I get the surgery. The pain is still there. Can anyone out there with trigeminal neuralgia tell me if they have a constant pain all the time like I do? I've had an MRI and a CT scan and they say nothing is wrong, so it must be that nerve. But everyone else seems like their pain comes and goes. Mine is always there.

Been taking Tramadol 100mg twice a day and 2-3 vicodin a night. Gabapentin 600mg at night. With decent results. New neurologist gave me 300mg of this crap to take twice a day. OMG the best way I could describe it is like being a depressed zombie. I took it for 17 days. Looking back the only thing I remember is deciding no to take it anymore. It is a horrible medicine that should only be tried as a last resort medicine!! It did nothing for the pain, in fact it might of made it worse! My Dr. never told me its main use is for anticonvulsant & BI-POLAR DISORDER!!! There is a reason why opioids have been around since 3440B.C. Its cause they WORK! 
12$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$6/2/2014 4:28:23 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$3$I don't recommend taking this unless you have your white blood cells monitored pre and during taking this.  I happened to hear that this medication causes drops in white blood cell levels so, I went to the doc and sure enough, my level was 2.9 vis 4.0-11.0. I was told to go off it immediately (Have to get off slowly) AND RETEST LEVELS ONE WEEK LATER.  I know you have to monitor risk benefit. For me, I get face pain episodes  approx 2 times per requiring me to take 3-6 imitrex during that time.  So, I would rather not take this drug.  I have heard Lyrica is supposed to be good but I am choosing to stop all. The risks of side effects long term is just not worth it to me.

I'm hoping and praying he gets back to normal.

17$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$3/21/2013 3:52:08 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$I was hit with an outbreak of shingles, on cranial nerve 5...which has caused Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN).  The pain was truly intense, only on the right side...I could not touch my scalp (shower water was horribly painful), my right ear had shooting pain into my jaw, right side of my face was numb and slack, and looked like I had a black eye. My gums & teeth on right side hurt, spices (even mustard on my hotdog) hurt!! I truly feared I had a tumor!!  Dr. prescribed Tegretol 100mg 2x day for two days, then increase to 200mg 2x for 2 days...working my way up to 400mg 2x.  On the 3rd day of the meds, I attempted to increase to the 200mg...and it was way too much.  Pain creeps in at the 100mg dose, so we are supplementing with a liquid and increasing it slowly as needed...seems to be working.  I do feel like I'm in a fog, have trouble thinking of words, speaking coherently, making sentences...I fall. I am depressed.  But the meds are helping with the pain...they work well...I just don't like the side effects...I even have to get someone to help my kids with their homework, as I just can't wrap my brain around it, which makes me feel worthless, which adds to the depression.  Have gained weight, which adds to depression. Very tired. Hoping it will only be a 6 month course of meds, hoping no more shingles.

It is also used to relieve one type of nerve pain (trigeminal neuralgia). 
Mine was located just under my molar on the left side of my face.
Ironically, I had just had a dental procedure done to the lower molar on that side of my mouth.
I repeatedly went to my dentist to have the severe pain corrected.
He could find nothing wrong, but gave me Vicodan to relieve the pain.
At first, the Vicodan worked. After 10 to 20 minutes the pain disappeared like the snap of my fingers. I can descibe it no other way.
It worked for a for about 3 hours before the pain returned.
It was not very long, maybe 4 days or so before it stopped working and I had that intense pain again.
I kept adding pain relievers to the vicidan...tylenol, asperin, alieve etc.
Nothing worked.
At one point I took the Vicidan, 3 tablets, 3 asperin, alieve and some percoset given to me by a co-worker all within an hour.
I know that this was dangerous and very very stupid.
However, even this excessive dose did NOTHING for the pain.
I finally went to my doctor and within seconds of explaining the pain and location he prescribed this medicine.
I only had to take 200 mg, for one or two days and my condition ended.

To me this is a miracle drug and thank the Lord for a miracle doctor.
I realize that this medicine is proscribed for many conditions and may not work for all of them, but for my particular condition, it was a Godsend."

Im only taking half a pill right now before bedtime.  I sleep pretty good, but wake up feeling very out of it and almost stoned.  right now it's been 12 hours since i took my 2nd dose and i am in a complete daze and very out of it.
Yesterday the facial pain was lessened, but the pain around the side/back of my head was still constant.  
The numbness in my lips is annoying, but i can live with that if i could just WAKE UP and shake this drugged out feeling.  Conversations are an effort.....I'd just like to go back to bed."

I can tell that it is still there because my teeth and gums are numb to the touch making it difficult to eat.  I have found a tremendous help with a Chiropractor. I am not a big fan, but went in with back pain and told him about TN and he did research and when I had pain, he helped it a lot.  Reduced the swelling and the pain went completely away after a few days.  Make sure you find a Chiropractor that practices the ""Gonstead Method"".  This is very important.  Tell him to research TN with his method and see if he can help.  I have had two bouts and it went away within two days of each.  No meds.  The doctor who diagnosed me is the head of Neuro-Surgery at Duke University.  Dr. Allan Friedman.  He told me to not use the Carbamazapine unless I had pain.  The drug makes me very tired and want to sleep all the time.  I was diagnosed 2-3 years ago.  Let me know if a Chiropractor works for you! "

I was hit with the worst pain in my life. Mine occurs at the top of the cheek, below the eye. It took me a week to finally go to ER cuz I just thought it'd go away & was saddened to find out about this ""disorder"". So little knowledge...I was prescribed Tegretol/Carbamazepine started out 1(200mg) 2x/day, then changed to 2 2x/, also at this change Gabapentin/Neurontin was added 1st 1(300mg) 2x/day, then 2x/day. It's now been 5 weeks & I'm only just now finally starting to see/feel the change happening. I do take pain meds as needed, which is slowly declining.

I developed a shingles outbreak while undergoing treatment for leukemia.  I found the drug to be much more effective than neurotin with occasional TN episodes.  After about a year I began having more episodes with an increase in pain with each episode.  My physician increased my does from 200 am 400pm to 400 twice a day.  I found myself depressed wanting to sleep 12-14 hours day and chronic dull headaches.  I am going back to my original dose and hoping for the best.  To all you TN suffers out there I pray a drug will be developed soon to releive us of our pain without all the side effects.  My physican couldn't put me on carbamazipine until I finished all my chemotherapy but it has definately been the best drug so far (except narcotics) in controlling the pain.

It took about 3-5 months to get the right combination of drugs, carbamazapine and sertraline.  Finally the pain subsided and became more of a dull ache than the stabbing spasms of electric shocks.  My dose became so high (600mg daily) just to control the pain.  It was worth it.  Then after about 2-3 years it stopped working.  I couldn't take any higher dose so switched to neurontin for 6 months.  Not as effective.  Tried accupuncture, seemed to help for quite a while, a year or more I'd say.  Then almost like magic symptoms went away.  I would catch a pain on occasion but nothing but a reminder of what it was.  Now, 13 years later, it is back with a vengeance and I am debating about returning the the drug.  I am not looking forward to that foggy, tired and weak feeling but anything is better than TN pain.  If you can tough out the weakness and find the right therapeutic dose, it worked for me.  I am counting on it working again.

Have backed off on dosage to try and gain some strength back, but can only go about 24 hrs without taking another 'poison pill' (as I call them) because the TN becomes excruciating.  (It really is the 'suicide disease' because you just want to be put out of your misery.)

I could not live without it - after having burning gums, severe jaw and facial pain for over a year, within 2 days of taking this I felt instantly better.  The only ancillary effect is that I don't have any mood highs or lows - just very even keel.  I guess that can be good in a way...

51$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$9/23/2008 6:11:25 AM$Reviewer: rs_pitts, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"Side effects, for me, included a threefold increase of the very symptoms it was supposed to qwell with continual recurrences for the duration of that particular dose (200MG Tab)lasting about ten hours with one episode/45min and a lull of about 10-15 min before the next. ""Onsets"" were non-existant. The medication seemed to be elevating and perpetuating existing symptoms. The medication was easy to ingest and Very Hard to tolerate. Hot Water Bottle or Ice Pack in hand, vertually all possible negative side affects were a part of these sessions. Trigeminal Neuralgia has been coined the ""Suicude Disease."" I consider myself ""fortunate"" here in that I characterize my experiences as a 9+ on the threshold and give a credit of 10 (IF that is the absolute max) to Cluster HA's. There is a history of lower limb reconcstructive surgeries to which I might attribute ""some"" number(s) but am at a loss to do so given environmental variables such as frequency and duration, as would be the case with any of the above in association with the other.

With both TN and Cluster HA's it has been my experience during the periodical adventures that doctors are quite willing to provide a script and say ""See me in X weeks."" Quite often it has already been X days or weeks that things have been progressing; On the floor, in tears, and absolutely helpless! If the Doctors writing the scripts had the opportunity to live in the patients shoes for 24 hours they might not be so casual about treating them as guinea pigs and realize some empathy toward what dehumanizing and painful experiences the patient has been goin through. Trial and error meds shouldn't be the first item on the MD's protocol. HEY DOC! This crap hurts - right here - right NOW. Good Luck Folks. "
