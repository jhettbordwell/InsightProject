My mood was back to normal and I could do things without being anxious. After approximately 8 months of taking Cipralex I started extremely sweating. 
2$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/16/2019 11:45:41 PM$Reviewer: JC, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Panic attacks due to pressures at work and generalized anxiousness for most of my life were alleviated along with therapy by 10 mg per day of Lexapro.  I started using it in October 2015 and have tapered to 5 mg / day in early 2019.  It is a mellow helper and cuts the edge of anxiety to where I see more clearly situations and events.

5$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/25/2019 10:01:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Took 5mg as prescribed finally one day to see if it would help me, made me feel anxious/restless and slightly euphoric but also gave me headaches and made it hard to gather thoughts clearly. Woke up the next day after and was still feeling the effect, the drug stays working in your system for more then a day. I discontinued use after that experience, take caution if you're considering taking it as this medication doesn't work for everyone.
6$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/22/2019 6:26:06 PM$Reviewer: CoffeeCats, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I've been on Escitalopram 5 mgs for a couple of months, and I swear after a week I started feeling better emotionally. My emotional well-being is better than it probably has ever been in my life. I only wish I had tried this years ago. I do have the yawns and feel tired 80% of the time. But my emotional well-being is more important to me right now than how I feel physically and energy-wise. I had headaches the first week, but those have gone away. No weight gain, not yet anyway. Thank you, Lexapro/Escitalopram!

If you’re like I was, you are sitting there wondering what happened to you, why you can’t get your old self back, and if you will ever feel better again. Maybe you dread the thought of medication...your anxiety cruelly makes you feel anxious about all the anxiety medication horror stories out there. The stigma around medication holds you back. No one will talk about it in real life...Maybe you worry it will make you a zombie ... or even worse, it won’t work at all. 

I can tell you that this was me a little over a year ago...and there IS hope. I’m a mid-30's male. Lexapro (Escitalopram) saved my job, my marriage, my family......my life. Anxiety and panic attacks had completely overtaken me. I was under a constant cloud of intense dread, overwhelming anxiety, and frequent panic attacks. I couldn’t sleep or eat...I lost more than 30 pounds (and wasn’t overweight to begin with). The decision to start on Lexapro (Escitalopram) was very difficult. In a cruel twist of irony, everything about the idea intensified my anxiety. I worried about everything you’re probably worrying about ... horrible side effects, how long it would take to work, not working at all, becoming addicted...all that stuff. Finally, I couldn’t take anymore. My job was suffering, my family was suffering, and everything I used to love brought me no joy.  Basically, I dreaded every moment of every day and night. 

I finally started on Lexapro (actually, the generic Escitalopram). To be honest, it took at least 2 full months for it to completely work. Maybe even 3. There was definitely some improvement before that, but finally one day, life felt back to normal. 

I can tell you now that I have my life back. Lexapro is absolutely, completely, unequivocally incredible. I feel like my “old self” again. The overwhelming anxious thoughts have disappeared, and I haven’t had a single panic attack. When I do begin to get anxious thoughts, I find I can control them and"

After reading someone else's review I learned of UTI problems, which I have had but that condition has been blamed on IVIG that I receive every 6 weeks for scleromyxedema.

My doctor prescribed it because I was having mood changes and extreme anxiety after taking the Depo shot. I didn't start feeling the effects of the medication until after 2 weeks. I felt the full effects after 4 weeks. I do have moments where I try to take myself off which is not recommended but when I do, I go back to feeling the way I did before. It has worked wonders for me.

Have had depression my entire life. Over the course of the 4 years I was on it I went through major insomnia, chronic bowl issues, no sex drive, and gained 50 lbs in 4 years. So in terms of wanting to kill my self less, yes it helped. Now 50 lbs larger and exhausted 4 years later, I am going off of it because of the effect that all has had on my depression.

For me, I felt an effect within a few hours. It comes on as very jittery and with the jaw clenching, very similar to SNRIs like Effexor. I've never had another SSRI react this way. It helps, I just hope the side effects get better.

My best example is on Christmas Eve, I dropped a bottle of soda coming out of the fridge and it exploded all over the kitchen.  I literally laughed even though I knew my company coming over were on their way.  I said, ""the old Michelle would have threw a fit, and Christmas Eve would have been ruined!""  The new Michelle just laughed it off.  I don't sweat the small stuff and I feel more rational, and feel like my old self again.  I have been on this medication for 6 months now, 10 mg."

I still get headaches occasionally but am better able to handle it.  No weight gain.  Just have to be mindful of the cravings and deal with it reasonably.

(Go figure) I get really bad anxeity right before meetings or even anything related to public speaking. Which would result in me taking my negative attitude home. This really was bad on my relationship as I was very snappy at home. I'm on day 3 right now of 5mg a day and I literally feel the positive effects get better daily. Day 1; I was a bit loopy and zoned out, but had this great feeling of euphoriaa couple of hours into it. Day 2, a little dry mouth but again, my temperament was great. Things that would infuriate me, didnt or at least not as much at all. No appetite for alcohol, at all. Day 3, starting to get this new energy I havent felt in a while. Also, just had a phone meeting and it felt like I was a different person speaking. I will log the effects for the next couple of weeks and share my experience.

26$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$10/30/2017 4:07:02 PM$Reviewer: alex, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$"TL;DR; I was prescribed 10mg daily of this medication to counteract moderate anxiety. But it has helped with panic attacks as well. It was effective almost from day one and I recommend it to others.

The Bad: I got nausea the first 2 days, headaches for about a week, soft stools for about 3 weeks and a small loss in libido. 

The Good: I noticed a real difference within days of taking the medication. I'm skeptical that it was a placebo effect because they say it shouldn't have full effect till 2-4 weeks, however, I don't care and I'll take what I can get even if it was a placebo effect. I used to have panic attacks, and general anxiety to many things. I'd hold to things for days and I'd generally be down, even though I was convinced what I had was just a ""regular amount of stress"". Right away, I noticed I didn't have rash and abrupt reactions to things, things rolled off me a lot easier and I approached everything in life more calmly. I've had more focus at work, I'm able to concentrate better and I'm more engaged with family and my kids. "

I was given this as an alternative to self medication (alcohol). I started on 5mg, and moved to 10mg. It has been unbelievable. Every drug effects everyone different, but Id have to say its changed my life for the better. It really took the edge off, i feel happier and more pleasant to be around, and im not as hyper vigilant and anxious. I definitely enjoy going out again and being friendly. Sex drive was minimally effected, however appetite has increased so i would suggest finding healthy things to eat such as fruits and veggies. Overall very pleased with the results.

Has kept my depression at bay during this time. Less feelings of anger and agression than before taking the drug. Downside is the loss of sex drive. I know that every drug has different effects on each individual. The 10 mg dosage has been effective for me. I have had more enjoyment of life.  It has kept me on a more even keel, even during the year when both of my parents passed away.

No, this drug won't make your forever elated, but it has made my life a LOT better. In fact, I don't know what I would have done without it.

Worth it, if you ask me!

34$Condition: Depression$5/17/2017 12:56:29 AM$Reviewer: Cajungal328, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Hi, I am a 41 year old female with diagnosed depression.  In the last 3 years I have had some negative life events happen that turned me into an emotional rollercoaster. I would be fine one minute then burst into tears for the smallest reason,  get bouts of anger and fall into depressive funk for days at a time,  have melt downs in public,  etc.  My GP prescribed me this medication 3 years ago, escitalopram 10mg, and I have been faithfully taking it ever since. 2-3 weeks after beginning this medication,  I was finally able to get off the rollercoaster and feel more balanced then I've ever felt.  I still have days where I feel no interest in doing anything in life now and then,  but for the most part I feel a normal balance with very few side effects.  I have had stomach issues,  and problems reaching orgasm, but I had these problems since before starting the medication so I don't think that's the medication causing this. Anyway I think this medication has saved my life,  and I am thankful for it.

Those Kinda passed,  it has got better. My doctor upped me to 20mg 3weeks ago and I'm starting to notice a little difference, just not as good as I was expecting to. I still have off/bad days regularly just not as often. I've heard this is a great med but really haven't noticed any major changes in aditude or motivation. Id like to be happy and normal (like all of us) if it doesn't make some major progress soon I think I'll try something else. Kinda like a hot dog that only has ketup and mustard on half. I think it works good for some but probably isn't for everyone.

Within 8 hours of my first 5mg dose, I was able to think and act normally. This was my first experience with any psychotropic medication.

I have had only 1 panic attack recently, which was fixed by a lorazapam dose. But over all this escitalopram has drastically helped with my day to day anxiousness. I see a lot of people saying it made them lose sleep, make sure you take your pill in the AM NOT PM. It will help you wake up in the morning instead of keeping you up at night! :)

I already see the difference, the first days I began with 5 mg and felt a little jumpy, when that subsied increased to 10 mg and felt less anxious and with more energy. Stuff that would trigger my anxiety and ocd didn't bother me so much anymore. Anyway I have a long way to go with therapy and probably I still need a higher dose of escitalopram, but overall I feel great.

First week I only noticed a minimal difference but it takes time to take affect. After upping the dose, then I saw a good change. I still worry or stress but it's not overwhelming and I don't go into a weepy, depressed spiral. I also noticed that I don't have that ""I hate my life/I want to die"" mantra in my head. There are side effects: sleepy, tired/listless, disrupted sleep, vivid dreams, dry mouth, constipation/diarrhea and lack of sex drive. The tired/sleepiness I can deal with because I was always tired when I was depressed too. Dry mouth? I drink more water, which is good. No sex drive? That's fine, going through a divorce anyway with no plans to go back into a relationship right away. The tummy troubles though do affect my job but I'll manage. This drug saved my life! I didn't realize how bad I was until the drug took affect and suddenly my life was better(even with divorce, finance trouble, stress). I didn't try the name brand but the generic is working for me."

43$Condition: Panic Disorder$4/17/2016 9:36:58 PM$Reviewer: Greypolopony, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$3$My OBGYN perscribed me Lexapro for being hysterical, moody, and weepy, (never told me the exact diagnosis) and my insurance changed it to this. It made me REALLY sick in the beginning; stabbing headaches, nausea, lack of appetite. It felt like I had a bad flu. After about a week I was finally functional again. It acts like a tranquilizer, I just kind of stopped caring about things. When I took it right before bed it knocked me out immediately into deep, dreamless sleeps which was nice after being so stressed. Side effect wise it killed my appetite in the beginning so I lost a few pounds and got thinner. It also made me more lethargic and killed what little sex drive I had to begin with. After several months it stopped being as effective at regulating my mood. I finally realized when I switched birth controls that it was Gildress that had been making me crazy and stopped taking escitalopram. I had about two days of feverish shaky withdrawals and headaches, but now I'm OK and sane on just Loestrin. I could see this drug being helpful to people with depression, but I'm still very mad it was prescribed to me to fix a symptom (hormonal problems caused by bad birth control) rather than addressing the root of the problem. I would not recommend it to deal with hormonal mood swings.

Then I lost all control of my emotions-weepy all the time over dropping a spoon etc.  My doctor prescribed this medicine at 10mgs and side effects were not worth it.

54$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$5/23/2015 3:05:20 PM$Reviewer: Max Bingham, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"I've used both citalopram and escitalopram on and off over the years. I was on a very high dose of citalopram (north of 40mg) and used that drug for two years.
Anyone considering using any SSRI needs to assess the clinical need of their use and weigh this against the potential side effects because there are many. These drugs take forever to start working. Don't under any circumstances exceed the dose you're prescribed without your MD's guidance...You will go to a very dark place. These drugs need to build up in your system. 
Once the citalopram took effect I felt the greatest I ever had in life...this in spite of the yawning and slight lethargy I experienced. Both drugs improved my concentration and I wake up feeling very alert. One other issue I had was that I relapsed when I tried to get off the citalopram and had to go back on it like less than a month after I discontinued. 
With the citalopram I had a reduced sex drive - not so much with the escitalopram. One other thing I noticed was that the escitalopram reduces my desire to drink alcohol...It may be useful for people with addiction.
My only complaint is that I wish this stuff would just work faster...if you're really suffering those initial three weeks before the drug starts to work can be rough. Furthermore I need higher doses of this stuff and regular MDs (not psychiatrists) can only prescribe this medication up to 40mg. Basically it's a commitment if you want to use these things and they're bit of a hassle to get on and off."

Prior, I've been on a number of widely prescribed medication to treat those conditions without seeing any benefits and having my symptoms worsen. Once I started on Lexapro, panic attacks have completely stopped within two months.  Depression has become manageable and almost completely gone in about 6 months.  Added benefit in my case - BMT migraines that I've suffered from for almost 6 years have subsided to the point where I only have to watch my diet.  Occasional episodes are now easily treated with Advil.  I've been able to resume normal life after only 3 months of being on Lexapro. Warning: in my case this drug definitely has caused long term sexual dysfunction. I was able to recover, to a point. As long as I am on this drug, I don't expect to have normal, healthy sexual drive. Also, I'd warn about switching from brand name to generic escitalopram. In my case, it caused quick return of debilitating mood changes.  I have to take twice the dose of escitalopram to get the benefit of single dose of Lexapro.

When I first started taking it I had an upset tummy with diarrhoea and nausea. I was perspiring more and had a general increase in symptoms of anxiety, like trembling, restlessness, nervousness and rumination. I Have just started my third week and all of those have reduced considerably. It's as if a wave of clarity has washed over me and I can take things on one at a time as opposed to feeling like I was caught up in an Avalanche and careening down a mountain! I don't have severe depression (just anxiety), but my general mood and wellbeig has improved - I have my appetite back, I'm more motivated to complete those everyday tasks, I'm less fearful of my anxiety and I can concentrate better! In my experience (on both occasions), the anxiety increased dramatically in the first week of beginning the medication - to really give it a chance, you need to batten down the hatches and get through this time. Also, give yourself the best chance by exercising, eating well and engaging in meaningful activities. Best wishes on your journey!

They went from a caring, calm, loving individual, to an aggressive monster. They began drinking alcohol, doing drugs, not caring about their education or career path. You would think that this sounds like depression itself! The thing is, they did not behave like this before taking the lexapro. The person became depressed because of a death in the family. They were behaving normally prior to taking the lexapro. The lexapro changed them! It was horrific to experience. Lexapro/escitlopram is THE WORST of the SSRIs. "

Started Lexapro 8 months ago. 10mg for 2 weeks then 20 mg since. First few days were aweful and almost quit. Had weird head, strange dreams, couldn't sleep. it really was aweful but after a week it was much easier and the depression and anxiety were significantly reduced. After 2 weeks the side effects were nonexistant (except for gas). No significant side effects after upping to 20mg. 

I have been on 20mg for 7 months and feel GREAT! It saved my life. The only remaining side effects are that I can eat until I explode. I've gained about 10 lbs but I have been more careful to not overeat lately and have that under control. The other is somewhat reduced ability to orgasm. No problem, I was a hair trigger before so we are both better off now.

I plan on slowely getting off the Lexapro over the next few months because the family, health and financial issues have eased. I do have some fear of widthdrawal or the returning of anxiety and/or depression but I don't want to stay on this forever so I need to know if I can handle the reduced stress or not.

Lexapro saved my life. Don't give up because of short term side effects. Give it a few weeks. Best decision I ever made."

118$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/2/2013 1:40:25 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$"I was prescribed Cipralex, 5mg once a day to start and to work up from there. Since the pills come in 10mg or 20mg only, I had to cut the 10mg pills in half. I lasted FOUR days on this medication before I pulled myself off. Day 1, it felt like someone had hit me in the back of the head. Day 2 I developed a ""travelling headache"" where pain would alternate between a sharp, stabbing pain at the forehead, throbbing at the temples and throbbing at the nape of my neck. Day 3 the headache had changed to stabbing pain everywhere. Day 4 it felt like my head was splitting open. And you can't just pop an Advil because it stops Cipralex from working. Ontop of the headaches, during all 4 days I felt like I was buzzed; that's the best way to describe it. I definitely couldn't drive and sometimes had problems forming sentences. Since I work FT between the pain and the inability to function on a basic level I decided this drug was not for me and stopped taking it. Withdrawal has been tolerable I suppose. Definitely not as bad as when I stopped Sertraline. Switching between too hot and too cold, lost some coordination in my upper limbs for a breif period of time, very little sleep, and oh yes a headache still. Though minor compared to yesterday. "

124$Condition: Other$12/19/2012 3:34:14 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$"I have taken the brand name Lexapro for over 5 years and been in complete remission of Borderline Personality Disorder for 4 1/2 years.  Once Lexapro went generic, I was excited for the cheaper copay, but within 3 weeks of taking it, I was depressed, underperforming at work, and suicidal.  I thought this was stemming from PTSD from an attempted mugging I experienced about 2 months before, and continued to take the generic form for another two months.  I ended up having to check myself into a psychiatric ward for four days.  Once I was released, I talked with my doctor and he said he had at least 12 other patients that all ""bottomed out"" immediately after going on generic Lexapro and it just took him some time to ""conenct the dots"".  It took only about a week of being switched back to the brand name and I began to feel ""normal"" again.  Then it took about 2 months to get my insurance to cover the brand name without my pharmacy charging me anxillary charges, but approval finally came through, so it's definitely worth investigating if you're forced to take generics due to insurance.  I am a big supporter of generic medications, but this generic certainly DOES NOT WORK."

179$Condition: Depression$10/25/2007 2:50:14 PM$Reviewer: PapaJoe, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I was on 90 mg. Paxil/day for 10 yrs. for MDD. It was effective, but only at that mega-dose. I tried to transition to Cymbalta which proved effective only at like mega-dosage so I reverted to Paxil.  A year ago I transitioned to Lexapro at 10 mg./day with great success.  The sexual side effects are GREATLY reduced.  My suicidal depression has not reared its head. The weltanschauung that makes me want life to be over is still there, but I accept it as existential, and tolerable, rather than as damning.
