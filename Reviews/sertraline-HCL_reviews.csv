1$Condition: Depression$1/21/2018 2:17:03 PM$Reviewer: D1nonlysnshn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been a ""highly funtioning"" depressed person for many years: life of the party, witty, intelligent, charming, intelligent conversationalist, highly successful at the top of the food chain in my field,
...until I got home. Work was an escape from myself for me. If I had no weekend functions to attend I would be catatonic, only getting out of bed to use the bathroom.
I had always felt like an outsider, looking in on life, trying to imitate what everyone else was doing, but never getting it quite right and others sensing that I was a fake.

I retired in Jan '17. Not having work as an escape anymore, in Dec my depression got again very bad. I talked to my girlfriend and she recommended sertraline as it has helped her. On 5 Jan, I saw the doctor, she prescribed 25mg as a started dose for 8 days, then 50mg, with a follow up 6 weeks later to see if the dose would need to be increased.
I experienced loose stools, wake/sleep cycle issues, decreased appetite, jaw tightness and jittery feeling initially. I experimented with taking my dose at night because it seemed that immediately after taking it, I had to go back to sleep. Taking it at night then kept me up. So I went back to taking it in the morning, as I figured it was a matter of me getting used to the med.
It has only been 2 weeks, but it seems like a lifetime ago.  The anxiety subsided first, then my depression. I no longer think of the smallest thing as the greatest catastrophe, my thoughts are no longer chasing around in my head like a bunch of squirrels and I am off the emotional roller coaster.  Thoughts from my past no longer send me into apoplexy. 
I no longer feel like a walking dead person-dead on the inside, waiting for physical death to catch up with me. No not suicidal-many years ago I came to the realization that I can only live once for a limited amount of time, but death is forever. Also, as long as I was alive, I always had a choice, but once I was dead, there was no coming back."

3$Condition: Depression$7/15/2017 12:04:47 PM$Reviewer: Superman, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken this medication for over 13 years.  I never had any suicidal or negative feelings when I started taking it.  I just got extremely irritated with people and thought I was as strong as superman to take on anyone; I had a very short temper.  This medication has been very effective for me. I have tried to reduce the dose to completely eliminate it, but once I do not take the full dose, my supermen strength returns.

My first prescription and my first attempt at beating this. They helped me immediately within 30 minutes of taking my first.  My outlook and spirit has lifted hugely.  I feel less fear to think about and talk about my problems and begin beating them. I have some intermittent shaky vision from them, but not so much it's a concern. Also my appetite is strange. I'm getting hungry, but quickly feel full during a meal. I take one tablet daily and the effects are lasting long enough to get me to the next tablet without any problem. I have a 28 day prescription with counselling to begin very soon.  I will update if anything changes.
5$Condition: Depression$8/23/2016 11:33:33 AM$Reviewer: LIFE IS FOR LIVING, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I probably was always prone to mild depression and the odd mood, but the strain of looking after my aged and ill father for about 4 years 24/7 took it's toll.  As my wife said at times it was like treading on eggshells with me.  I was put on 50mg of Sertraline and after a week or two I felt human and happy again.  I came off the tablets last week after about 3 years (had tried after one but it was too soon) and feel fine.  If I suffered any side effects then not sure what as some things could be put down to getting older although not too old, just coming up 59, but feeling tired at times and yawning is about as bad as it got.  Maybe some colic but easily sorted with the very occasional domperidone pill.

Anyway for me Sertraline was good.  "
6$Condition: Depression$8/12/2016 1:31:16 AM$Reviewer: Jennifer, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$"There is a difference between sertraline and Zoloft (generic vs. brand name). Not all sertraline manufacturers are the same. I take the one made by aurobindo. After taking it for over a year (after a 15 yr break from name brand Zoloft which didn't give me any trouble), I started waking up with severe anxiety a few mornings/week. I feel like something terrible is going to happen and had to take an inventory of what's going on for the day so I could calm down.I have breakthrough depression where I'm depressed for twenty minutes or so, then it just disappears for days. I get really tired but have trouble sleeping. I also get shooting pains through the side of my head and more ""regular"" headaches on top of my typical migraines. I've checked on this and there are issues with the generic. I'm going to see if I can switch to the original Zoloft or ask Walgreens to change manufacturers. Look up your manufacturer, check out other people's experiences and print it out to show your doc if you need to. We all know that some don't like to listen to patients. The first generic manufacturer was green-something. I did get an *extremely* dry mouth and eyes, but after a few months it got better."
7$Condition: Depression$2/15/2016 7:08:30 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken this medication for 20 years. A dosage of 50 mgs daily. There are side effects, sleep disturbances and increased appetite but they are easier to cope with than the depression.
8$Condition: Depression$2/3/2016 9:06:42 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month$1$1$3$2 Days after I started, I felt worse. I was absolutely miserable, I had suicidal thoughts, no appetite, and I just wanted to sleep. No willpower, no strength, nothing. A week after I missed a dosage and the next day I felt so much better. I was happier and smiling and could actually eat. Overall, I absolutely hate it. 
9$Condition: Depression$7/6/2015 6:07:40 PM$Reviewer: chester, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$In March, I mentioned to my MD that I was feeling slightly depressed. He prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft). Stopped after 5 days because of severe side effects (insomnia, diarrhea,nausea,headaches). Side effects stopped immediately. About a week later developed a rash, starting on torso, spreading from chin to ankles. In next week or 2 developed blisters over entire body, covering nearly every sq. inch. Very painful. couldn't sleep . This is now July. Most blisters have gone. Some scabbing remains with a few open sores. Treatment began in April and will continue for 2 more months. 5 doctors feel that (although not 100% certain) that the Zoloft caused it since that was the only drug recently introduced. The result was a condition called Bullous pemphigoid, a rare skin condition. Although I'm sure that many people will tolerate this drug, I can only suggest that they proceed with caution and stop it at the first sign of side effects. This is the worst condition I have ever experienced. Docs also mentioned that this is more common in people over 60.

It's worked wonders for the anxiety. Interacting with others (even strangers!) is much more comfortable now. It helped my depression for the first year. But for the last few months I've been constantly sleepy, no energy whatsoever. I've been late to work often because I can't drag myself out of bed in the mornings. I don't want to give up on it because it's helping with my other problems. But maybe it works better when supplemented with another anti-depressant?

12$Condition: Depression$4/24/2015 9:13:21 PM$Reviewer: Sertraline Feedback, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$Really didn't help me. Had problems with easy bleeding and insomnia. Stopped about 3 weeks ago, and now I sleep better and bleeding has decreased (blood noses and easy cuts). Doctor was not happy, said I had to see him again. No way. I came off the same way I went on, gradually over two weeks, 25  MG a day for those two weeks. Personally, my Therapist was far better for me, and she doesn't give me drugs. If this works for you, great! If it doesn't, no need to take it.

I had a severe and rare allergic reaction to the medicine. If you ever start having ""Tics"" like Tourette's, immediately call your doctor. My doctor unfortunately blew my reaction off, so I had 3 E.R. visits in 4 days and went to different towns before they finally helped me at St. Joseph's. It did work for me, in the beginning, that was the only real good thing it did for me."

15$Condition: Depression$12/9/2014 6:58:13 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$"I started taking Sertraline for my depression and chronic anxiety that had developed over the last two years. At first I had trouble with my sleep schedule, and lost about 10 pounds, but now I am eating fine and I have no problems with sleeping. My  depression/anxiety has definitely improved, but I wouldn't say I'm at my 100%. To be honest, I do sometimes have suicidal thoughts I did not have before, but the warning label DID say that people under 25 could experience them. I know that sounds like a huge reason NOT to take this antidepressant, but I just remind myself its the drug making me think that way and then I feel fine again. I do recommend this to anyone who has mild depression. For anyone with severe depression, you may want to try something with less ""intense"" side-effects."

21$Condition: Depression$4/22/2014 7:32:40 AM$Reviewer: Me, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$"I started on 50mg taking half a tablet at night for ten days. It made me feel extremely ""sick"", ""dizzy and disorientated"" and my head felt heavy and ""big"". This usually occurred around 10am. I felt so bad that I would crawl into bed and sleep for about a hour. Usually felt a tinny bit better after I slept. As per the prescription I increased the dosage to one tablet at night - thinking that the increase may help - but it became worse. I used the one tablet for 2 days only then went back to using half at night. I also thought that I will rather cope with the depression than feel this bad. I have since stopped using it completely. Who can afford not to be able to concentrate because you are feeling so ""bad"" that you have to go to bed that time of day?"

26$Condition: Depression$11/8/2013 2:46:54 PM$Reviewer: cs, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"My experience with sertraline is very positive, I was taking Prozac before which turned me into a robot. Not so with sertraline, it took about 3 weeks to start making a difference(150mg a day)but the result is profound.
I noticed when lowering the dose it causes dizziness and chaotic thought patters and when I have any alcohol at all I have no memory whatsoever from during having a drink.
And I get hit by an overwhelming depression afterwards so I stopped drinking alcohol altogether.
Sertraline changed my life around 180' from being suicidal to be able to have a successful career.
As mentioned in other review it does effect sex drive but to me it is a side effect I can live with taking in account the benefit it provides."
27$Condition: Depression$11/3/2013 7:06:07 PM$Reviewer: WANTED OLD SELF, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I started taking this, drug again about two weeks ago.  ""Backup six years ago and I was taking this drug and I was having all kinds odd side effects: insomnia, having thoughts of suicide, panic attacks(which I have without this drug but are more severe with this drug)"", anxiety, restless legs,arms and top of my back. I have an appt w/DR in 10 days, but if nothing changes in next couple days I will stop taking and contact my DR. As soon as I started getting restless and panic attacks were worst, I remembered feeling all of this before and that is why I am concerned. I am so tired of feeling like a shadow of who I used to be and I don't like it at all. This Med has about the same effect on me as muscle elaxers; Instead of helping me I am one of thode rare people that has the reverce effect on me. Instead of decreasing or stopping my severe restless legs, this drug Increased the restlessness in my legs and had me up from my hospital bed from about 1am to 6am walking the hall up and down for this time period because when I stopped the restlessness was too severe. Final Note:I also am my husband's caregiver and have been for 5 years. He has severe brain damage because he died twice and lack of oxygen and blood to his brain caused the damage."

38$Condition: Depression$5/10/2013 10:21:05 AM$Reviewer: nonbiased, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I took sertraline (Zoloft) for about 2 months to treat anxiety/depression. The drug guide I have, because I am an RN, and my practitioner said I needed to take it for at least 3 weeks to a month to see the effects. After about 2 weeks, I started getting dizzy spells and felt lethargic. This came intermittently. After about a month I noticed the dizziness wasn't near as bad but I could not concentrate to anything to save my life. At the second month mark I decided to pull myself off because it was starting to effect my decision-making ability. It may have helped the depression a little, but not enough had I kept taking it. When I stopped taking it, I got really bad dizzy spells, withdrawals, and sometimes had to catch myself grabbing the walls or anything around to keep myself from falling, which came intermittently as well. This was just from taking it for two months. While I was withdrawing, I searched the internet and found others who had the exact same problems with the extreme dizziness. It took me another 3 weeks to stop having the dizzy spells. I would rather deal with the anxiety/depression than to take this medication again. Keep in mind though, this medication may work for some and not for others, but coming off the pill is hell. Not to mention the loss of libido is not a wanted action to the medication.

However, other side effects hit me like a ton of bricks this morning. Since I've started taking the medication, I've been in the restroom every 1-2 hours.  This morning I woke up with what felt like the equivalent of taking 2 Dulcolax. Also, had nausea/vomiting, fever, sweating, and both triceps went numb.

I'm a college student, and I basically feel numb. I hate it. I stopped going to class, and stopped completing my homework, it makes me want to sleep all the time, and I feel super withdrawn. I feel like I'm on the outside looking in and that I can't tell myself to wake up, every day is like going through the motions, and I don't truly enjoy anything anymore. I don't really look forward to anything, I basically stopped caring. And sex..... I pretty much don't care about it anymore, it's extremely difficult to orgasm, or to enjoy sex. I used to love sex. Very awful feeling.

I have not experienced the severe side effects noted here...vivid dreams, loss of appetite to a certain degree, however nothing as severe as what I have read. I spoke with my physician and pharmacist just today and with research, have learned that often a secondary medication serves to compliment this (or whichever primary medication), one may be using. I also agree with several of the posts here re: the benefit of exercise, which has shown to produce significant physiological benefits. Bottom line ... don't give up!

The bottom line is, you have to find the drug that works for you. I'm sure many people experience horrible side effects, but I have never experienced any, whatsoever. I am thankful for this drug because without it I'm a nutcase. However, it is important to see a therapist in conjunction with medication. That makes a world of difference.

119$Condition: Depression$6/11/2010 10:58:39 PM$Reviewer: Sad Mom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $1$1$3$I am writing this for my daughter, Julie.  She was perscribed this medication to treat her depression.  She had had thoughts of suicide a few months prior to taking this medication.  After two months of taking these pills she passed away from suicide by hanging herself in her father's basement, she was 17 years old.  She had had severe trouble sleeping, shaking and also severe mood swings.  She also experienced heavier then normal menstral cycles.  Doctors should monitor these patient taking anti-depressants with more care.  My daughter was admitted to an Ontario Canada hospital with her first suicide attempt, they released her only after a couple of days.  The original stay in hospital was to be two weeks......All I can say it is sad when hospitals would much rather give a patient pills and not the care they need.

I went back to him and he uped my dosage to 100mg. Since then i been feeling alot better. I been on it for about 8 months now, and im going to try and wean off it sometime soon.

I attribute Zoloft with getting me out of the street as I went from teaching to being homeless due to a severe emotional breakdown.  I don't know where I would be without the Zoloft.  I do know, for a fact, Zoloft should not be given to children or teen-agers as they are TOO strong.  Zoloft should be give to adults only and by that I mean 30 yrs and up.

It took forever for me to finally admit that I had a problem and go to my doctor, but thank God I finally did. It took me three weeks to notice any really serious improvement, but once I did it was like I finally got my old self back again.  The only side effects I have experienced is a very slight decrease in interest in sex (nothing major, just takes a little bit longer) and drowsiness. Since it has caused drowsiness, I simply started taking it at night and solved another long term problem, insomnia. Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with the results.

I started on the 50 mg dosage and was moved up to 100mg this month.  (Got moved up due to lots of changes coming into my life, not that the 50 mg didn't work)  
I have had a few strange dreams in the past, as well as having trouble sleeping (especially when first starting the drug and the dosage up-age) 
I have had a lower sexdrive but can usually pick it up after a while.  I haven't gained weight on Sertraline, rather I've lost 40 pounds in the last year--no changes in sitting on my butt or anything. =)
I like this better than lexapro and celexa, I think it works better and a bit quicker.
It did take a week or so to notice changes in my mood (for myself anyway) so don't think it's an overnight thing."

I'm pretty sure this is only because it could be too high of a dosage though and I'm too worried.  Usually side effects like thoose don't last long and my doctor is always there. Overall this is a good drug. Though like any other drug, there is really not much of a grey area.  It either works for you or it doesn't.

Sertraline helps me get a handle on my terrible depression, in the morning.
However, it only takes the rough edges off the depression.

I have noticed things are brighter and more optimistic so I definately feel like it has helped with my emotional breakdowns and I can actually laugh and enjoy more things now.

The only down sides to it are slight weight gain and lessened sex drive but considering it pretty much got rid of my manic depression and anxiety it is worth sacrificing those two things.  

One note:  for about the first two weeks you take it you will have moderate to severe nausea, or at least I did.  It passes though so don't stop taking it.  It also occurs again if you forget to take a couple of doses (as well as your symptoms coming back...).

Also, Zoloft may change the way you taste things.  I used to smoke but after about a month of zoloft the taste of cigarettes made me instantly sick to my stomach and eventually so did the smell of the smoke (I guess this is a good thing though).

Also, if your depression/anxiety was causing you not to have a good nights rest you will have the best sleep of your life on Zoloft but for first month or so be sure to schedule at least 8 hours for sleep or else you will wake up lethargic. "

I don't have panic attacks anymore and my depression isn't that bad. I tried so many drugs before this one and was very afraid to use this one but it did help a lot and I am glad I am on it. I have been on it for a few years now.  It took about a month for it to work totally on me but I did feel a lot better after two weeks.  The only thing I don't like about this pill is (sertraline HCL tablets by Teva USA)are much larger and uncoated.  I would rather take the brand name instead.  Yes I do get dry mouth and my sex drive did slow down. I also am alittle cranky if I forget to take it. But I can live with this. Before I could barely function.

I became tired easily and usually exercise 5X a week vigorously. I became almost faint when I tried to work out while on the drug.  I also lost 5 pounds in a week (very unusual for me).  My appetite decreased probably from the lask of exercise, but could be the med.  Going to switch to Zoloft.

In about 2 weeks I felt like the fog had been lifted. I was on it for about 6 months in 2002-03 (quit cold turkey), and went on it again in November 2007 after a particularly rough few months. I am weaning off it now. The only side effect I noted was a loss of libido, and I am less of a ""copntrol freak"" - to my employees' and son's delight! Alos was prescribed Atavan this time for anxiety, but do NOT advise taking both at the same time - very, very depressed - borderline suicidal. Was able to realize the problem and went off Atavan asap."

I have used other medications for depression and everyone of them made my symptoms worse than they were to begin with, I am been on this for over 6 months and it sits well on the stomach, aids in getting to and staying asleep. Did not affect my appetite or weight. Only one problem and that would be the lack of interest in a sex life. But then again I did not have much interest during my severe depression, I am sure that will come back later on.

I would never do it, but it ocaasionally crossed my mind in my thoughts.  I don't know if this was from the drug itself or because I was in a deep depression from my current divorce.  It's hard to say.
206$Condition: Depression$6/4/2008 8:56:58 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I've been on this medication for about a year. My moods have mellowed, which has been GREAT. Prior to using the medication, I would get depressed for weeks/months and couldn't deal stress but now I don't have the extreme lows (highs & lows). It keeps me on an even keel. 

I also had a bit of anxiety going into public places where there were large groups like bars or parties. Now, I don't feel so fearful. The difference is I may not like to go BUT I GO, rather than sit home.  

I recommend it for all to try. ONLY side effect I noticed was 20 lb weight gain & not being able to lose it even when I am eating right and going to the gym.

My doctor raised the dosage to 100 mg and that has been very good with the depression symptoms but now I've had terrible diarrhea for the last 2 weeks. The doctor told me to decrease the dosage again to 50 mg but I'm afraid that the depression symptoms will come back. Does anyone have advice for dealing with the diarrhea? Does it go away?

I am taking it to treat my depression and panic attacks, which I started having when  was 13 years old, after trying to cope with my anxiety with ""mind over matter"" after 6 years I was tried. I began this medicine after horrible depression that lasted longer than normal. Being 18 and on anti- depressants was a little frightening at first, but I am extremely happy with my decision to get on them. I'm actually kinda of disappointed I didn't start them sooner. I have a few side effects: nausea, and loss of appetite, but totally worth it! I recommend this for anyone who is qualified and sick of constantly struggling to cope with the disorders. I hope it works for you as well as it did for me!!!!"
