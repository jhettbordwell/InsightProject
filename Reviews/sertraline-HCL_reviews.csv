0$Condition: Depression$1/16/2020 6:26:12 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$3$Started taking it as an add on to bupropion 300XL which had started to loose effectiveness for my depression, 25 mgs didn't do much but 50 mgs did help. I found the sexual side effects to be very real and am making a trade off between depression and a sex life.
1$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/29/2019 3:17:30 PM$Reviewer: Madmac, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I’ve been on sertraline a little over a year now and I’m generally happy with the drug. I’ve had depression and anxiety as long as I can remember but since starting sertraline i’ve been more motivated and have less suicidal ideations. I have a few side effects, most notably restlessness, especially in my legs, when I try to sleep or sit still. It’s always been an issue for me, but the drug has certainly made it worse in that regard. Otherwise, I’m doing pretty well. Hope you are too.
2$Condition: Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction$6/6/2019 4:36:57 PM$Reviewer: syd, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I started this medication in the fall on 25mg/day, when I had not been diagnosed by a psychiatrist.  It is now the spring and I have been diagnosed with social anxiety, dysphoria, and mild ptsd.  I am up to 200mg/day.  When I started I felt a bit high, but it was such a relief that the voice in my head that hates me turned off! I don't have any side effects now, other than heartburn if I don't drink enough water with the pills.  Therapy has helped so much too, but this medication is helping me feel comfortable on the subway, speaking or being silent when I want to, and at this point I'm smiling for no reason every day.  But I feel like myself, not numb or out of touch with reality.   
3$Condition: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder$5/4/2019 5:58:49 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$"I consumed Sertraline with Fluvoxamine and Trifluoperazine, one of each for 3 days. At first, I could feel some pain in my neck but since I had a cold at the same time, I thought the pain was somehow related. My pain gradually increased and on the third night, turned into dystonia (one of Extrapyramidal symptoms -sustained or repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures). Now that I recall this experience, I feel extremely frightened and petrified, buy at that very moment, I couldn't feel anything and had no control over the crazy movements of my neck backwards and muscles near my brows and on my cheek. I somehow managed to wake my parents up at 1 A.M. and they were panicked to see me like that. I kept saying ""help me"" but literally had no control. I was lucky enough to be treated with benzatropine through intramuscular injection and after five to ten minutes everything had gone back to normal. I don't really know what could've happend if I hadn't received the medication. Would it last forever? Would it cost my parents quite a fortune to cure? All I know is that I'm never ever ever going to trust my psychiatrist or any other and I totally believe that medication is not worth the side effects and it definitely wouldn't cure your original disease. It would only suppress the symptoms. However, therapy may help you much more significantly. I don't think I'm going to take any kind of special medication in the future, because I will remember the trauma and the pain. Even when I'm writing this my fingers are shaky and I don't even know why. I think this experience has somehow treated my OCD nevertheless, because I'm inspired to slowly but surely work on my symptoms and never go to any kind of doctor's in the foreseeable future."
4$Condition: Panic Disorder$4/22/2019 1:24:19 AM$Reviewer: Scareddude1232, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Took these pills for 2 days. Only 10mg. Felt weird so stopped right away. 3 weeks later I have worst anxiety of my life, canâ??t sleep, canâ??t work, canâ??t focus. Most scary thing on earth. Iâ??m almost certain theyâ??ve ruined my life. I had bad anxiety before but able to live normal happy life. I hope I save someone who reads this. Small things everyday things are now a challenge. I failed to do my research now just another statistic to the many others destroyed by this. If you are at all hesitant to try medication do not risk it.

Iâ??ve never tried anything else I take 50mg a day I did notice when the DR. tryâ??s moving up my dosage I become a walking zombie so I just like the 50mg.

I've been taking the drug to help with my POCD for about 10 weeks now and I am noticing a HUGE difference in my anxiety, mood and levels of intrusive thoughts. 

The first few days were horrible - shaking, sweating, couldn't sleep - but after a few days I didn't really have any side effects. 

I noticed a change after about 5 or 6 weeks - quite a sudden change, like the thoughts bothered me much less and could go away easier. I'm on 50mg at the moment and am having counselling. 

It doesnt get rid of OCD, but makes is MUCH more manageable. So I would recommend these pills to everyone with OCD!"

Sertraline....awful side effects, anxiety, panic, etc...switched to Cipla mfr and the syptoms went away...WOULD NEVER recommend putting anyone on the Aurobindo (I take 100 mg)
12$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/15/2018 3:13:13 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$This stuff has saved my life, plain and simple. I've literally had no ill side effects except for headaches, dizziness and some tiredness upon first starting 25 mg. Since increasing to 50 mg after the first week,I've experienced no side effects whatsoever. I take this at night for extreme social anxiety and after only a month I am feeling like I fully have my life back. I would recommend this to anyone having obsessive, racing, unwanted thoughts, trouble sleeping, anxiety, panic, low self esteem or trouble concentrating.   
13$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/25/2018 1:47:41 PM$Reviewer: Eli James, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $2$1$3$I took this medication and it was by far the worst antidepressant I have ever tried. It didn't work at all. I had persistent panic attacks while on every single dose. I had to change my dose around 5 times, each one of them not showing any improvement. I don't recommend this for anyone who has multiple disorders and is being told to treat them all with this. I was told this would help with my OCD, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and body dysmorphia. This medication made me feel worthless because it was so ineffective. 
14$Condition: Depression$1/21/2018 2:17:03 PM$Reviewer: D1nonlysnshn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been a ""highly funtioning"" depressed person for many years: life of the party, witty, intelligent, charming, intelligent conversationalist, highly successful at the top of the food chain in my field,
...until I got home. Work was an escape from myself for me. If I had no weekend functions to attend I would be catatonic, only getting out of bed to use the bathroom.
I had always felt like an outsider, looking in on life, trying to imitate what everyone else was doing, but never getting it quite right and others sensing that I was a fake.

I retired in Jan '17. Not having work as an escape anymore, in Dec my depression got again very bad. I talked to my girlfriend and she recommended sertraline as it has helped her. On 5 Jan, I saw the doctor, she prescribed 25mg as a started dose for 8 days, then 50mg, with a follow up 6 weeks later to see if the dose would need to be increased.
I experienced loose stools, wake/sleep cycle issues, decreased appetite, jaw tightness and jittery feeling initially. I experimented with taking my dose at night because it seemed that immediately after taking it, I had to go back to sleep. Taking it at night then kept me up. So I went back to taking it in the morning, as I figured it was a matter of me getting used to the med.
It has only been 2 weeks, but it seems like a lifetime ago.  The anxiety subsided first, then my depression. I no longer think of the smallest thing as the greatest catastrophe, my thoughts are no longer chasing around in my head like a bunch of squirrels and I am off the emotional roller coaster.  Thoughts from my past no longer send me into apoplexy. 
I no longer feel like a walking dead person-dead on the inside, waiting for physical death to catch up with me. No not suicidal-many years ago I came to the realization that I can only live once for a limited amount of time, but death is forever. Also, as long as I was alive, I always had a choice, but once I was dead, there was no coming back."

16$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$9/21/2017 6:17:45 PM$Reviewer: Nikita, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I began taking a low dose of sertraline in 2011 after years and years with no treatment for my depression, anxiety, PTSD and panic. I thought I'd gotten better and stopped taking it (please, never do that) and got really worse. I am back on, now taking 100mg in the morning and 100mg at night and I feel much better again, like my old self. This medication has quite possible saved my life.
17$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/16/2017 1:15:40 PM$Reviewer: $4$4$4$I started taking this medication approximately 5 years ago for an anxiety disorder.  It has helped me immensely, reducing my panic attacks and general anxiety.  It of course is not 100% effective, but that is where all the mental stuff comes in.  I started on a lower dose and built up, so side effects were barely there for me.  I have yet to try to come off or reduce my dose of this medication.  An added bonus is that if I forget a day here and there it doesn't make a big difference, because it stays in my system, and would take about two weeks to fully be removed.  For me, this works a lot better than a daily anxiety reducing drug.  Overall, I am happy with how this drug has helped to improve my quality of life.

I never had any suicidal or negative feelings when I started taking it.  I just got extremely irritated with people and thought I was as strong as superman to take on anyone; I had a very short temper.  This medication has been very effective for me. I have tried to reduce the dose to completely eliminate it, but once I do not take the full dose, my supermen strength returns.

I had exactly those side effects you described from one particular brand.  It was Tillomed.  They set me back a long way.  My doctor gave me a new prescription so I could request a different brand.  I've found both Crescent Pharma and Aurobindo to be excellent brands, both in 50mg.  Some teeth clenching, and my sex drive is flat, but otherwise my physical and mental health is bright.  Now into my 5th month.  Have been told I'm being weaned off soon.  Fingers crossed.

My doctor retired, so I went to a new, younger doctor.  He recommended I get off of Xanax and on to Sertraline.  After 4 months of withdrawal hell, I was off of Xanax and on Sertraline.  I have had only one mild panic attack since then.  There were a few, minor, start-up side effects, but those have since left (loose bowels and dizziness).  It is good not having to carry around Xanax to take 3 times a day!

My first prescription and my first attempt at beating this. They helped me immediately within 30 minutes of taking my first.  My outlook and spirit has lifted hugely.  I feel less fear to think about and talk about my problems and begin beating them. I have some intermittent shaky vision from them, but not so much it's a concern. Also my appetite is strange. I'm getting hungry, but quickly feel full during a meal. I take one tablet daily and the effects are lasting long enough to get me to the next tablet without any problem. I have a 28 day prescription with counselling to begin very soon.  I will update if anything changes.

I realise now that I was depressed and had attacks of anxiety for many years thinking I was normal. More recently (2-3 years) I have been very angry, cry at silly things, not wanting to go out, very negative, memory loss It got to the point where I thought I was going mad.  My husband made me go to the doctors.  I finally gave in and I haven't looked back.  I feel fantastic. No more crying, feel amazing.  Happy to socialize.  I never want to come off of them.  They are a life saver!

It works extremely well when it is taken consistently, but if you are on a high dose like I was and missed even one pill it can send you into a downward spiral. As far as helping with overall anxiety it has helped tremendously but situations sometimes still can send me into major anxious fits.
27$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/17/2016 5:57:06 PM$Reviewer: Dalten,  Male $4$4$5$My cousin was diagnosed with OCD and severe anxiety.

One night we were watching TV before bed and all of the sudden he moves around a bit. Then the next thing I know he starts touching me and grabbing me slowly, so I turned to him and it looked like he was absolutely awake. So I was like what the heck and I grabbed and shook him but nothing happened. After shaking him more he finally woke up and freaked out, this is why you dont wake up a sleeping dramer/sleepwalker. Needless to say, he was actually sleeping but one of the side affects of this drug causes some weird stuff to happen in his sleep. But overall, it does its job.

As my wife said at times it was like treading on eggshells with me.  I was put on 50mg of Sertraline and after a week or two I felt human and happy again.  I came off the tablets last week after about 3 years (had tried after one but it was too soon) and feel fine.  If I suffered any side effects then not sure what as some things could be put down to getting older although not too old, just coming up 59, but feeling tired at times and yawning is about as bad as it got.  Maybe some colic but easily sorted with the very occasional domperidone pill.

Not all sertraline manufacturers are the same. I take the one made by aurobindo. After taking it for over a year (after a 15 yr break from name brand Zoloft which didn't give me any trouble), I started waking up with severe anxiety a few mornings/week. I feel like something terrible is going to happen and had to take an inventory of what's going on for the day so I could calm down.I have breakthrough depression where I'm depressed for twenty minutes or so, then it just disappears for days. I get really tired but have trouble sleeping. I also get shooting pains through the side of my head and more ""regular"" headaches on top of my typical migraines. I've checked on this and there are issues with the generic. I'm going to see if I can switch to the original Zoloft or ask Walgreens to change manufacturers. Look up your manufacturer, check out other people's experiences and print it out to show your doc if you need to. We all know that some don't like to listen to patients. The first generic manufacturer was green-something. I did get an *extremely* dry mouth and eyes, but after a few months it got better."
32$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$8/8/2016 11:38:45 AM$Reviewer: antisertralination, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I was prescribed this medication to combat panic attacks and general anxiety associated with lifelong eating disorders/body dysmorphia. Over 10 months after starting the treatment, I gained 30 stubborn pounds that mostly sat around my abdomen and face. I run 60 miles a week, weight train 3 times a week, and eat a strict diet. By the time I made the connection between my weight gain and the drug I had already spent 10 months redeveloping bad eating disorder habits to try and control my weight. For the past 6 days I have ceased taking the drug cold (no weaning) under supervision of a NEW doctor. The withdrawal symptoms are unreal -- like having the flu PLUS a terrible hangover right after putting your head on a bat and spinning around and around and around and around. Positively speaking, all of the sleep issues, bad dreams, numbed sexual sensation, loss of emotion, fatigue/sluggishness I experienced while taking the med has almost completely reversed in less than a week. Seems pretty clear my body processed this drug as pure junk.

I have seasonal affective disorder, but was hospitalized for major depressive disorder and total suicidality when I began taking Prozak. Until I started taking Zoloft, I had severe problems with mental energy and spent a lot of time in bed as an adult, especially during my menstrual period. Unfortunaately, Prozak gave me akathesia. My doctor then put me on Zoloft, which does not cause me akathesia. After I started taking Zoloft, my doctor added Wellbutrin to help me ""focus"" better (Wellbutrin  works on movement disorders like Parkinsons). With Zoloft (now Sertraline), I now have a wonderful sense of well being. I never get depressed and have great energy. A couple of times when I didn't get my Zoloft prescription refilled right away and went without it for several days, I could feel myself crashing and begin to feel depressed. So, now I refill my prescription right away. I'm doing so well that now I see my psychiatrist only once a year, when she gives me a prescription for three months of Sertraline, with a refill for three more months in that year. Then I visit her for my annual exam again."

I had been using St John's Wort for 2 years and it worked perfectly.  My Dr. wanted me to switch to this Rx so he could regulate it.  I immediately felt different (in a not good way) after starting the med.  By the time I had taken the sixth dose, I was calling the Dr. with symptoms of diarrhea, insomnia, upset stomach, mild zombie-like feeling. As the nurse was asking me questions, I passed out.  After about 5 minutes I began to come around.  About 20 minutes later (while the EMT's were with me, I passed out again and had to rushed to emergency room.

I'd like to say that depression can do everything and Sertaline was the only medication that really restored my morning woods again and I can now get it up with no problem at any time. 

Those who are still worried they could have ed. Make sure you are not depressed before opting for viagra or any other remedies. 

I took 150mg for the first time and made me so drowsy, so I dropped to 100mg per day, it's only 3 or 4 days now and the effects on my sexual problems are wonderful. 

I still have loss of appetite and insomnia, but I hope these side effects will improve in few weeks.


Make sure you visit your doctor before taking this medication as we may not have the same case.

I hope this may help someone.


Thx"
44$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/23/2015 11:31:46 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have had anxiety most of my life but it got much worse along with panic attacks after having my kids and then going through menopause.  I started on Paxil and it worked but made me out of it and I gained a lot of weight.  I switched to Sertraline and have been on it for more that 6 years.  You need to give this drug a chance to work as it needs to build up in your system which can take up to 3 months.  The side effects will go away.  My life has improved immensely.  At one point I actually shut down and couldn't even talk to my kids.  This is an imbalance in the chemicals in your system so don't let anyone tell you it is a crutch.  You wouldn't think to tell a diabetic that needs insulin that they don't need it.  This is the same thing.  Also, if it is not working, go back to your doctor because their are lots of other options.  Good luck!
45$Condition: Depression$7/6/2015 6:07:40 PM$Reviewer: chester, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$In March, I mentioned to my MD that I was feeling slightly depressed. He prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft). Stopped after 5 days because of severe side effects (insomnia, diarrhea,nausea,headaches). Side effects stopped immediately. About a week later developed a rash, starting on torso, spreading from chin to ankles. In next week or 2 developed blisters over entire body, covering nearly every sq. inch. Very painful. couldn't sleep . This is now July. Most blisters have gone. Some scabbing remains with a few open sores. Treatment began in April and will continue for 2 more months. 5 doctors feel that (although not 100% certain) that the Zoloft caused it since that was the only drug recently introduced. The result was a condition called Bullous pemphigoid, a rare skin condition. Although I'm sure that many people will tolerate this drug, I can only suggest that they proceed with caution and stop it at the first sign of side effects. This is the worst condition I have ever experienced. Docs also mentioned that this is more common in people over 60.

It's worked wonders for the anxiety. Interacting with others (even strangers!) is much more comfortable now. It helped my depression for the first year. But for the last few months I've been constantly sleepy, no energy whatsoever. I've been late to work often because I can't drag myself out of bed in the mornings. I don't want to give up on it because it's helping with my other problems. But maybe it works better when supplemented with another anti-depressant?

52$Condition: Panic Disorder$12/27/2014 11:12:20 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I started having anxiety/panic attacks in my late teens. I used to take xanax as needed on and off for a few years. I stopped taking xanax and I became a heavy drinker to self medicate and this only made my symptoms worse and I became a daily drinker to get rid of the anxiety. I decided to get sober in march 2014 and in october I decided I needed to try medication again. I started at 25mg and noticed on the first day my anxiety was gone. I had a panic attack on day 2 and have not had one since. I know they say it takes weeks to work, but somehow it worked right away for me. I increased the dosage each week by 25mg and I now take 150mg a day to manage my anxiety/panic and minor depression. I did not know how bad my symptoms were until taking the medication and looking back to how much better I feel. the constant worry is gone. heart palpitations are gone and I do not have a constant fear that I am having a heart attack. my migraines are gone and I no longer have the constant fear of having a stroke or aneurism. my stomach issues have improved as well. I no longer stress over minor things and I do not feel that I have to force myself to do daily tasks and go to work. this drug has worked wonders for me. side effects at first included nausea and lack of appetite which only lasted a few days. second week at 50mg i was always tired. diarrhea when increasing dosage, but only lasted a day or 2. gives me energy which I compare to the feeling of when your coffee is kicking in and feel super happy but not in a manic way. this has decreased a bit so it may be a side effect of getting used to the medication. I take the medication in the morning. This is my first experience with an SSRI and I consider myself lucky that I found one that worked on the first try. don't let the horror stories scare you into not trying an SSRI. I also notice that I no longer have obsessive thoughts about alcohol. I have no desire to drink which is great for a recovering alcoholic. 2 thumbs up!

At first I had trouble with my sleep schedule, and lost about 10 pounds, but now I am eating fine and I have no problems with sleeping. My  depression/anxiety has definitely improved, but I wouldn't say I'm at my 100%. To be honest, I do sometimes have suicidal thoughts I did not have before, but the warning label DID say that people under 25 could experience them. I know that sounds like a huge reason NOT to take this antidepressant, but I just remind myself its the drug making me think that way and then I feel fine again. I do recommend this to anyone who has mild depression. For anyone with severe depression, you may want to try something with less ""intense"" side-effects."

There is NO treatment, so the diagnosis is an automatic death sentence by suffocation. He moved home after his diagnosis, then I lived at Hospice with him the last several mos. of his life. He had a morphine pump in his tummy for his unbearable neuropathic pain , but was unable to dispense the medication himself due to contractures in his hands. The nite he woke me, whispering ""Momma, I can't breathe"", Hospice nurses could only put a ""re-breather"" on his face BECAUSE THERE IS NO TREATMENT. It took him 5 days & nights to smother.  I'll never forget the ""clicking"" sound he made from somewhere in his neck as he struggled to breath. After watching this for 5 days, I begged the nurses to make it stop.  I was asked if my husband & I had given him permission to ""let go""...of course, we had not!  Never entered our heads to do so!  Hardest thing I've ever done...tell my son it was ok to die. Sorry for this...when I initially started writing this, all I meant to do was review sertraline. Then, diarrhea of the brain radiated to my fingers, resulting in the above dissertation. My apologies to all of you.  Pre- sertraline, I continued to ""live"" at hospice 24/7.  After my psychiatrist gradually raised my dosage to 300 mg. in the a.m., I no longer lived there. I still think of my son 100 times a day, have numerous triggers & flashbacks, but there is ONE BIG DIFFERENCE NOW...the thoughts are fleeting! Yes, they come, but then they leave!  I know my life has forever been altered...was asked to take early retirement from my good state job when my mom died exactly 1 yr. after my son, I isolate, no longer laugh or act silly, am unable to concentrate or sleep, ad nauseum, but (& this is the biggie)...I don't ruminate 24/7 about the hell my son went thru, thanks to sertraline.

Growing up I was just labeled as 'moody' and having a bad temper.  It wasn't until after having my 1st child that the symptoms became so overwhelming (had stroke level blood pressure) that I saw a doctor for it.  Was diagnosed with severe panic disorder and mild depression.  I tried several different meds until Zoloft/Sertraline made a difference.  It was amazing to see how much of life I had been missing up to age 24 due to anxiety. I have been on it for over 10 years now and plan on taking it for the rest of my life.  That realization was hard at first but, now I think of it as a diabetic needing insulin.  I have tried to wean off of it and my anxiety came back with a vengeance.  My philosophy now is why suffer if I don't have to.  To those of you concerned about not being able to have children - I'd like to assure you that the medical community has conducted studies and the risks of taking Zoloft during pregnancy are minimal.  I took it throughout my second pregnancy and my daughter turned out just fine.  My OB/GYN felt that the stress due to un-treated panic disorder would have been more dangerous to my unborn baby due to increased blood pressure levels etc. than the possible affects of Zoloft on the baby.  The only complaints I have are the decreased sex drive (don't worry, it does come back) and the 'electrical zaps' I get in my fingertips and head when I miss a few doses (usually doesn't happen unless I miss at least 2 days).  All chemicals affect people differently so, one person's negative experience doesn't apply to everyone.  My advice - give Zoloft/Sertraline 2-3 weeks to fully integrate in your system and for any initial side effects to wear off.  If you still don't like if after that, wean off and try something else but you may be surprised if you give it a chance.

I noticed when lowering the dose it causes dizziness and chaotic thought patters and when I have any alcohol at all I have no memory whatsoever from during having a drink.
And I get hit by an overwhelming depression afterwards so I stopped drinking alcohol altogether.
Sertraline changed my life around 180' from being suicidal to be able to have a successful career.
As mentioned in other review it does effect sex drive but to me it is a side effect I can live with taking in account the benefit it provides."

""Backup six years ago and I was taking this drug and I was having all kinds odd side effects: insomnia, having thoughts of suicide, panic attacks(which I have without this drug but are more severe with this drug)"", anxiety, restless legs,arms and top of my back. I have an appt w/DR in 10 days, but if nothing changes in next couple days I will stop taking and contact my DR. As soon as I started getting restless and panic attacks were worst, I remembered feeling all of this before and that is why I am concerned. I am so tired of feeling like a shadow of who I used to be and I don't like it at all. This Med has about the same effect on me as muscle elaxers; Instead of helping me I am one of thode rare people that has the reverce effect on me. Instead of decreasing or stopping my severe restless legs, this drug Increased the restlessness in my legs and had me up from my hospital bed from about 1am to 6am walking the hall up and down for this time period because when I stopped the restlessness was too severe. Final Note:I also am my husband's caregiver and have been for 5 years. He has severe brain damage because he died twice and lack of oxygen and blood to his brain caused the damage."

There was a traumatic incident(s) that started it all. I suffered until I was 22. I began taking Paxil and felt much better but the problem was I had too much energy. After a couple years the doctor switched me to Sertraline. The change was unbearable so she included Klonopin which helped. The problem was she kept me on the Klonopin for years. I changed doctors because I became really ill and the doctor had no idea how to care for me. My new doctor wanted me to decrease the Klonopin and taper off completely. The withdrawal was horrific. But I took my sweet time and was able to stop. She said in for my diagnosis Sertraline alone should help with the attacks and Klonopin is as needed not an everyday thing. I have to tell you my life has changed for the better. The only issue I have is I may never have children because being off the meds is unthinkable. Its unfortunate but true. Either way what kind of mother would I be if I had attacks all the time? I wish I had seen a psych at a younger age, I may have gone to college sooner.

My anxiety came back with a vengance even with exercise and meditation.  I decided to get back on it and have been on it ever since, still at 50 mg.  The only draw back for me is that it has made my blood pressure higher so I need to watch my diet and exercise.  Overall it has really helped me with my anxiety."

117$Condition: Depression$5/10/2013 10:21:05 AM$Reviewer: nonbiased, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I took sertraline (Zoloft) for about 2 months to treat anxiety/depression. The drug guide I have, because I am an RN, and my practitioner said I needed to take it for at least 3 weeks to a month to see the effects. After about 2 weeks, I started getting dizzy spells and felt lethargic. This came intermittently. After about a month I noticed the dizziness wasn't near as bad but I could not concentrate to anything to save my life. At the second month mark I decided to pull myself off because it was starting to effect my decision-making ability. It may have helped the depression a little, but not enough had I kept taking it. When I stopped taking it, I got really bad dizzy spells, withdrawals, and sometimes had to catch myself grabbing the walls or anything around to keep myself from falling, which came intermittently as well. This was just from taking it for two months. While I was withdrawing, I searched the internet and found others who had the exact same problems with the extreme dizziness. It took me another 3 weeks to stop having the dizzy spells. I would rather deal with the anxiety/depression than to take this medication again. Keep in mind though, this medication may work for some and not for others, but coming off the pill is hell. Not to mention the loss of libido is not a wanted action to the medication.

The side effects are annoying but I do not have to constantly take xanax anymore.  I still take half a xanax occasionally, maybe once every couple months so i would say that is an improvement.  However, I really do not want to be on a drug for the rest of my life, but absolutely know I will have to be.  I have tried to come off of this medication and after missing just 1 pill I am completely dizzy to the point of not being able to function and feel like I am in a fog with terrible headaches.  I absolutely HATE that this drug controls me so, and would NOT recommend anyone start taking it in the first place.  Plus, I have side effects such as headaches, low sex drive and a long list of other health problems that may or may not be related.  I am also worried that I will never be able to have kids because I will never be off this med.  Even tapering down does not work.  Please don't take this drug unless you absolutely have to.

It has given me abilities I never thought I'd be able to achieve. It helped me manage my life and be a normal person in the society again. But the down side is it loses effectiveness at times...it's like it's been lost somewhere in my stomach, therefore never absorbed into my system... that's how I feel when it doesn't help my mental condition. 
153$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/17/2012 4:40:04 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$5$5$5$"I suffered with anxiety and panic attacks for 16 years and finally decided to try medication since no other ""home remedy"" had worked. I am so sorry I hadn't done it sooner! I did have some side effects the first few weeks (upset stomach, drowsiness) but stuck with it. I found that taking it in the evening after dinner helped. I find I am still a little drowsier than usual but the anxiety is manageable and the panic attacks have been reduced to almost non-existent. If you are hesitant to take medication, I understand, believe me I was too, but this has improved my quality of life significantly.

I'm a college student, and I basically feel numb. I hate it. I stopped going to class, and stopped completing my homework, it makes me want to sleep all the time, and I feel super withdrawn. I feel like I'm on the outside looking in and that I can't tell myself to wake up, every day is like going through the motions, and I don't truly enjoy anything anymore. I don't really look forward to anything, I basically stopped caring. And sex..... I pretty much don't care about it anymore, it's extremely difficult to orgasm, or to enjoy sex. I used to love sex. Very awful feeling.

If after 1 1/2 weeks of taking it what is it going to be like after a couple months? I honestly feel like a whole new person. It is a great feeling being able to do things that I couldn't do. Just stick with the med yes the side effects suck but they do pass. Its well worth it! good luck to you

This has got to be one of the best meds for treating panic/anxiety disorder. I am a happier, healthier person today then I was 38 years ago. My only complaint is that insurance companies and doctors take it upon themselves to switch you to generics. There is a HUGE difference from taking Zoloft versus Sertraline. All Generic drugs are not as good! I am okay taking Sertraline but I do notice the difference. Taking the real Zoloft had much better results!

It is actually this generic Sertraline that I take, though, so I just wanted to chime in here, too.  Thanks to Sertraline, my obsessive thoughts have stopped plaguing me.  Before, it was as if my thoughts were a swarm of bees around me;  I was unable to make them go away, but they never stung me, just hung around threatening all the time.  They caused me great anxiety, and sometimes full blown panic attacks.  Now, the bees are more like gnats, and I can simply wave them away, or walk to a place where they aren't hanging around.  I feel great.  No bad side effects.  I sleep well, and my mind is more clear during the day.  And best of all, no great disturbing fear or anxiety looming over me constantly.

I should have been on this years ago, however it wasnt given to me until my menopause kicked in, and my hormones went nuts!  I told my doctor that I cry for no reason, general feelings of my world caving in, overwhelming feelings of doom and sadness.  I was in rough shape!  I truly recommend this medicine.  The only side effect I have is diaharrea which unfortunatly  is 5 or 6 times a day!  No more hemmroids!

I have not experienced the severe side effects noted here...vivid dreams, loss of appetite to a certain degree, however nothing as severe as what I have read. I spoke with my physician and pharmacist just today and with research, have learned that often a secondary medication serves to compliment this (or whichever primary medication), one may be using. I also agree with several of the posts here re: the benefit of exercise, which has shown to produce significant physiological benefits. Bottom line ... don't give up! I am facing bankruptcy, among other challenges, and although we will all have good and bad days, there is never a good reason to harm oneself or others. I choose to stay positive, and hope you will too!

It has affected me so postively, and I've been on it for two years now. I hope to eventually wean myself off of it, but as of now I'm extremely happy with it. The bottom line is, you have to find the drug that works for you. I'm sure many people experience horrible side effects, but I have never experienced any, whatsoever. I am thankful for this drug because without it I'm a nutcase. However, it is important to see a therapist in conjunction with medication. That makes a world of difference.

She was perscribed this medication to treat her depression.  She had had thoughts of suicide a few months prior to taking this medication.  After two months of taking these pills she passed away from suicide by hanging herself in her father's basement, she was 17 years old.  She had had severe trouble sleeping, shaking and also severe mood swings.  She also experienced heavier then normal menstral cycles.  Doctors should monitor these patient taking anti-depressants with more care.

I started trembling and shaking and feeling scared for my life. I did have anxiety attacks before, but, I learned to fight them off before this, but, this time around, I couldn't. I ended up in the ER. I felt weak and was trembling talking to the nurses. They told me I was normal except for the symptoms. I was given a shot of Ativan and I was almost instantly calm and my symptoms were gone. I told my doctor and he just prescribed me Ativan.

I would say after two weeks i noticed a difference. my hubby says he notices i'm calmer and he doesn't have to tell me to ""relax"" like he used to. i have noticed that the panic attacks still come but not as intense and i can talk myself out of them mostly. wondering if i need a higher dose? hope that they will just go away as i would not wish feeling that way on anyone! side effects i notice loss of appetite, feel jittery like i have to be doing something constantly, diarreah, and unfortunately a decrease in libido.

He originally prescribed 50mg, but after meeting with a psychiatrist, my dose is up to 100mg and the difference is huge.  The 50mg was only taking the edge off so I didn't blow up, but the 100mg never even allows it to get that intense.  I'm taking it along with Klonopin in anticipation of traveling in a few weeks, and I'm confident I can travel and be away from my son for the first time without any major breakdowns.

I started on the 50 mg dosage and was moved up to 100mg this month.  (Got moved up due to lots of changes coming into my life, not that the 50 mg didn't work)  
I have had a few strange dreams in the past, as well as having trouble sleeping (especially when first starting the drug and the dosage up-age) 
I have had a lower sexdrive but can usually pick it up after a while.  I haven't gained weight on Sertraline, rather I've lost 40 pounds in the last year--no changes in sitting on my butt or anything. =)
I like this better than lexapro and celexa, I think it works better and a bit quicker.
It did take a week or so to notice changes in my mood (for myself anyway) so don't think it's an overnight thing."

I'm happier, I'm doing better in school, and I'm more connected with my family.  The only problem is that recently I've been having some serious insomnia and my toes and fingers twitch a lot.  I'm pretty sure this is only because it could be too high of a dosage though and I'm too worried.  Usually side effects like thoose don't last long and my doctor is always there. Overall this is a good drug. Though like any other drug, there is really not much of a grey area.  It either works for you or it doesn't.

Sertraline helps me get a handle on my terrible depression, in the morning.
However, it only takes the rough edges off the depression.
I can not remember ever not worrying about something, but in my older age, it is much worse.
I do like the way sertraline has helped me make it through the day, but wish my depression would totally leave."

I have noticed things are brighter and more optimistic so I definately feel like it has helped with my emotional breakdowns and I can actually laugh and enjoy more things now.

362$Condition: Depression$5/31/2009 2:02:27 PM$Reviewer: Alaina S, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I switched from Lexapro to Zoloft about a year ago and it has worked very well for me.  The only down sides to it are slight weight gain and lessened sex drive but considering it pretty much got rid of my manic depression and anxiety it is worth sacrificing those two things.  

One note:  for about the first two weeks you take it you will have moderate to severe nausea, or at least I did.  It passes though so don't stop taking it.  It also occurs again if you forget to take a couple of doses (as well as your symptoms coming back...).

Also, Zoloft may change the way you taste things.  I used to smoke but after about a month of zoloft the taste of cigarettes made me instantly sick to my stomach and eventually so did the smell of the smoke (I guess this is a good thing though).

Also, if your depression/anxiety was causing you not to have a good nights rest you will have the best sleep of your life on Zoloft but for first month or so be sure to schedule at least 8 hours for sleep or else you will wake up lethargic. "

Finally my doctor switched me to sertraline 50mg about four months ago and I feel amazing.  This rx has been a lifesaver for me!  I have gained a few pounds, but don't believe it's from the medication.  I really believe that I am much more happier and relaxed and have been more social, going out and what not.  I believe that's where the weight came from.  The only thing is that if I miss a dose, I can immediately tell within 12-24 hours, and my anxiety begins coming back.  I highly highly recommend this medication for someone with depression/manic phases/anxiety.  Excellent med.

I spent less than a year on it and didn't even need xanax after a year and a half. Now I'm back on it for anxiety once again. I have side effects such as shaking, occasional diarrhea, drowsiness, and some occasional mild to moderate depression. The doc assures me it will go away in a few weeks as my body adjusts to the meds. On a positive note, I've only been taking Zoloft for a week and I already notice the change. Although I'm not anywhere near over my anxiety yet, most days are bearable whereas a week ago I thought I couldn't take it anymore. Its an amazing medication even with its mild discomforts, which I'm sure will subside.

436$Condition: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder$9/26/2008 1:21:27 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"For the past nine years I have been a complete germophobe, resulting in worsening anxieties and obsessive complusive behavior. I would have periods where it would get slightly better and then I would slip into bad periods again. This fear and behavior was severely crippling my ability to live a normal life. 
Then finally after the most extreme episode I had ever gone through, and much prayer, I asked my doctor about medication to help me. She recommended Zoloft/ Sertraline to help me get past that initail attack of anxiety when I would encounter something that triggered my fear. It did not completely relieve me of all symptoms but made it possible to more rationally think about what happened and not become overwhelmed by the emotional reaction. 
I have taken this medication for the past six months and I would not say I am completely cured, but I have seen dramatic improvements in behavior, habits, and anxiety levels. Since dealing with this condition I have never had this level of comfortability and control. 
I started out taking 25 mg a day of this medication, and my doctor slowly increased it after several visits to 200 mg a day. On my own, as I have experienced improvements, I have slowly decreased my daily dosage to 150 mg, then to 100 mg, and I am now taking 50 mg a day and still doing well. The goal of my doctor was to get me to point where my initial reactions were controlled and then wean me off of it. In my case I knew I would not be on it for the rest of my life or even a few years. 
I am grateful for how this has helped me but I also know that God was and is working in my life and that he works in the ordinary things of life like doctors and medicine. To him be the glory. "

440$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/9/2008 10:33:04 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"First started having panic attacks about 6 months ago, happened whenever I got into a car or had to drive somewhere that I felt uncomfortable driving to and from. Stemmed from a fear of having to use the bathroom in a public setting and not knowing where the closest bathroom is at any given time. My thoughts were always centered around ""where is the closest bathroom"" and these thoughts caused my relationship with my girlfriend to be strained. I started taking this medication 3-4 months ago, and at first I felt no different. It took about a month or more for me to notice anything. I am able to travel freely without worrying about these things. At times if I let my mind wander I might get the precursor of a panic attack, but I am able to subdue it into the recess of my mind. In closing, this drug is not a solution for a problem, but a ""will-augmentation"" drug, that is, it gives you that push you need to stand on your true ground, and not the ground that your illness shackles you to.

It keeps me on an even keel. 

I also had a bit of anxiety going into public places where there were large groups like bars or parties. Now, I don't feel so fearful. The difference is I may not like to go BUT I GO, rather than sit home.

I've been taking this drug since and have found that when I have stopped thinking I was feeling better ..... I've become suicidal !  So I now take my meds every day but I recently had a deep depression and after a 2 week stay in hospital, my doctor upped the dosage and with 8 weeks of group therapy, I am now more aware of my condition and will keep myself in check before reaching the abyss next time !  at least I hope so !  
Knowledge is power ...... I have also become aware that I've had 4 major depressive episodes in my lifetime, approximately 10 years apart.  At 18, 30, 43 and now at 59.  Bipolar is controllable so get help !  "

465$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/16/2008 10:36:21 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$5$5$"I have never taken medication for anything, and was very apprehensive about this. Started with 50mg and does was upped to 100mg after a few months. I had severe anxiety w/ panic attacks. It was a nightmarish exhistence b/c it just started happening out of the blue. I thought I was going insane. Panic attacks were the worst b/c the addrenaline rush from them would keep me up/awake for 2-3 days time. This drug has saved my life. 

I have been on it for almost a year, and have felt like my normal, energetic, positive self for about 8 months. 

I am concerned, however, about pregnancy. I have always wanted children. Will have to discuss with doctor as I have read sertraline can cause problems w/ pregnancy and birth."

It's only  been a month and I feel in control again. It's a life saver for me and my family. I can now cope with things normally and not hide away and worry obsessivly. It's amazing. I realize it's not for everyone, but I recommend to at least try it. The first week was tough, diahreah, jittery, anxious, but it got better and better everyday. Worth it!
468$Condition: Depression$2/22/2008 11:42:30 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been taking this medication for just over a month and have recently doubled my dose to 100mg daily b/c it wasn't previously helping. Starting the medication gave me hope, and continuing it helped me feel better more often and for longer periods of time. It hasn't, however, helped much with my obsessive-compulsive tendencies, but I will stay on it to see if it will soon help; either way, I am glad I am getting treatment and meds to help.

I'v been on it for 3weeks now and I was most worried about my sex drive dropping. It's actually increased and my orgasms are stronger! Not to mention that I'm feeling wonderful mentally! I'm not depressed or have the crazy anxiety! The minor side effects are no big deal like dry mouth, had a hard time sleeping a few nights, and sometimes I get very sleepy, but its getting better. I am only on this one med and a very low dose...25mg. Anyone else have better sex drive and orgasms??? is this normal? It's a god sent!

I went off of it a few years back and thought of killing myself and children. i have been back on the drug for about year and half. I don't know how I could ever get off it. I now will take it everyday. I can not function with out it. My life has changed since I went back on it. My kids see a difference too. I have more to live for. And if that means that I have to take it forever then thats what it means. I can now go through the whole day with out crying over something on tv. or getting upset over the littlest things. I love the way that it makes me feel. I had a problem with an upset stomach too, but i learned to eat somthing before I took the drug.

Kept me from suicide. Both my parents died last year, and again, I don't think I could have made it without the med plus supportive friends. But for the past 6-8 months I don't think it's working as well. I'm on 150mg, which I think is pretty high already.

I don't just worry about everything getting nothing done like I used to. This med has been a life saver to me and is the only med I have ever taken.

I take only 50mg and it does the trick.

I've had panic attacks since I was 12, and finally started taking this in my late 20s.

I sort of had a placebo effect when i first started treatment that made me feel less anxious, however my doctor said this was not common.  I think just the thought of starting treatment made me feel better.  My anxiety has definately decreased and no panic attacks since starting.  I am just worried of becoming dependant on this drug after my treatment is complete. Whats with the ED and no ejaculating?? Some info on this would be great.

488$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/25/2007 12:59:11 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug was only effective for me when I first took and stayed on a mood stabilizer to address my mania. I went through the agonizing process of being treated solely with anti-depressants twice by my family doctor. Unfortunately, he only saw the depression but missed the harder to detect manic side. SSRIs alone made me feel worse at it amplified my mania. Topamax and Sertraline have worked wonders for me. The third critical piece is working with a therapist that truly understand bi-polar.
489$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/21/2007 1:26:20 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$"I began to take this medication due to progressive anxiety and panic attacks.  Once I had been perscribed this medication I felt much better knowing that hopefully my perscription would help me. 

After being on the medication for about 2 weeks I noticed that the panic, aniety, and depression seemed to slip away.  I still had bad days, but the dwelling and panic subsided.

Now after being on the medication for over 6 weeks I feel like I am back to normal.

The only side-effects I have noticed with the medication is when I began to take the medication, I noticed that when a panic/aniety attack was begining I felt a sensation of tingling or a slight shiver upon the onset of an attack.  This sensation was very mild and went away after a week.

I am very happy that I spoke to my doctor about this medication.
