0$Condition: High Blood Pressure$2/1/2019 2:32:34 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Best BP med I've had. Very effective at keeping blood pressure levels in check, which is very important, since I only have one kidney.  I think it might cause a little tiredness, but I take it early before I wake for the day and 12 hours later in the eve -- so it's not a problem.

I've tried other medications only to get horrible side effects.  I highly recommend Clonidine.  It does make you tired when first taking it but once your body adjusts, it's fine.  Plus it also helps with hot flashes and excessive sweating - For me, that's an added bonus!
2$Condition: High Blood Pressure$3/16/2018 6:45:53 AM$Reviewer: Vango, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$My GP warned me about this med and said, don't take it. Went to my cardiologist and have been on generic Toprol 200mg daily then he added this med 0.1mg morning and night. I've been taking this awful med for 2 mths. now and have such severe constipation. Lack of sleep and urinary incontinence. Gradually stopping this med. Now only taking one at night and will get off this asap! 
3$Condition: High Blood Pressure$12/3/2017 1:29:54 PM$Reviewer: CC, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$On six different BP meds which rarely drop my pressure below 140/85. Started taking clonidine.1mg about two months ago. BP dropped to an average 10 points on both sides. Reduced meats from diet, now getting readings below 120/70. Waiting to see if this remains consistent, but it has been the most affective drug I've used over 20 years. I only take it at night due to zapping my energy levels. 
4$Condition: High Blood Pressure$7/27/2017 9:50:55 AM$Reviewer: Clonidine, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$5$Started taking 0.10 mg 3x per day August 2016. Experienced dry mouth, terrible nightmares, bad attitude. Backed off all blood pressure meds (with help from Doctor) One 0.10 mg Clonidine in the morning only helped maintain pressures at 145/70/70. Stopped Clonidine started Cardizem 120 mg 2x per day as an alternative to Clonidine. Only have a few days history but so far ok. Pressures still at 140/70/70. I have been taking blood pressure meds for 40 years and am convinced the less meds you can get by on the better you are.

Also, going through menopause. Already taking 2 BP meds and 1 anti-anxiety med, but BP still high at the doctor or hospital or certain situations like a spousal argument. So far, this med works for high-stress situations. Not tested yet at the dr whom I'm seeing again this summer, so we will see if this med also works.

I tried others but went back to this because it worked wonderful. During the day my mouth got so dry that I couldn't handle it, but it's wonderful when I only take it at night. I take Metaprolol during the day if it gets above 140.

11$Condition: High Blood Pressure$8/17/2015 7:30:39 PM$Reviewer: GLGL, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$Typical side effects: Dry Mouth (night), Pace Maker working harder at night due to slow HR.  BP still spikes when working moderate workout on treadmill.  Constipation solved with Magnesium Supplement which also eliminated evening cramps in my legs.  Wake up with heavy legs until I have walked around a bit.  Had to reduce to .05mg three times a day as side effects with .1mg tablet somewhat severe.  Dreams are vivid and sometimes bothersome. This is medicine of last resort as I am alergic to other types of meds.  I still have random jumps in BP to over 220/110 which can last for an hour to a few days.  The clonidine helps to reduce these jumps to less than 170/85. I have been checked for pheochomocytoma and found negative.

Side affects so far are a VERY DRY MOUTH (like swallowing cotton balls!), very tired within an hours of taking pill and sleep has been sparatic due to having to urinate more due to to excessive consumption of water to combat dry mouth (.1 2x daily), and have seem to have lost sexual desire.  Have Tourette's as well but too soon to see if it helps.  I seem to be calmer, more relaxed- maybe too relaxed.  Jury is still out- will stick it out for a month or so.  nice to see my BP is normal for the 1st time in 30+ years.

Extremely tired after taking, hair started to fall out, experienced terrible dizzy spells and 30 plus pounds weight gain. Lost control of my bladder after a few months of taking, (way too young at 55 to have all of those symptoms appear AFTER starting the medication). All of these symptoms become worse so I stopped taking the medication. Within 3 days of stopping the medication my bladder problems improved, my hair stopped falling out by 95%, and each day I am SLOWLY starting to feel normal again. It became so bad that I stayed in bed unable to function. This medication is awful and although it is inexpensive and easy to take, the side effects were horrible. I am slowly getting better. It also caused my blood pressure to spike. Awful medication.

I had alot of hair loss and within an hour of taking it during the day I become so tired that I have to sleep if I don't I get a painful headache and my body hurts until I nap. I am trying to get off this drug but as soon as we decreased the dose my bp went right back up. I am having horrible withdraw symptoms from it. I hope I can get off of it and find something that works just as well.

The cost was over one hundred a month, so I went with Clonidine. The Clorpres has a diuretic in it, but otherwise it is just Clonidine. My biggest problem is hair loss. I am finding it too annoying. My hair was fine with Clorpres. The BP numbers are okay. I went through over 17 prescriptions before settling on the Clorpres,and I feel I need to go looking for something else or resolve myself to a hundred dollars a month for medication.

I also get frightening palpitations at night when I lay down. Dry mouth also but overall better reading than before.  I used to take lopressor but that stopped working after a while.

34$Condition: High Blood Pressure$3/29/2013 11:00:19 AM$Reviewer: TJ, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$3$Started Clonidine HCL 0.2 MG twice daily, about a week ago. My high BP was very stubborn, even after a change of lifestyle and regular exercise. Clonidine started working immediately and by day two my BP was down tp 118/72. It does have a very calming and relaxing effect, which can be a tad annoying at work. Plus the dry mouth can be bothersome. But all in all I'm a firm believer in the effectiveness of this drug. My last eight BP readings, at various times before and after taking Clonidine, have averaged 114/68. If you have stubborn high BP that hasn't responded well to other high BP drugs, you may want to give this one a try.

37$Condition: High Blood Pressure$11/2/2012 5:03:12 PM$Reviewer: Gary Leigh, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Started on .1 2X/day, then upped to .2 when BP not lowered much and then .3 2X/day which brings it down to 120's or less/80's. BP was 190/130 when started and down right away(1 day)after the .3 dose 2X/day. Been on it for about 1 year and like it because it lowers BP to normal and also calms me and I won't take benzos because of addiction, tolerance, withdrawal. Had severe tiredness, no energy, no motivation for 1-2 mos. but not bad any longer. The Walgreens summary sad this could last several weeks so I kept going and it did get better. When I would not take a BP med and have very high BP, I would get constant 24hr dull, pressure frontal headaches and the Clonidine, lowering my BP, took it away.
Before Clonidine, had taken 3 others and none lowered my BP below 140's/90-100. I like Clonidine, and only side effects are the tiredness which does get better with time, dry nostrils, throat and eyes(not debilitating at all). Wish I didn't have hypertension but I do and feel better taking Clonidine."

The ARNP I was told to see because my new doctor was out and her ARNP was too busy, the back ARNP took me totally off my blood pressure pills, I have been on for 10 years off because I was covered in hives. Well the next day I was in the hospital for not only the hives and trouble breathing, I was withdrawing. So the Hospital gave me Clonidine 0.1 mg and I have not felt better in years. It lowered my blood pressure really well, and I had been running high for a year. Anway, the Clonidine evened me out, and I feel like a new person. I have a cough, and dry mouth. The cough might be from the residue allergy reactions, I don't know but my doctor isn't worried about it right now. She wants me to give my body a break. So we are doing this. My legs do get a little heavy but that is alot better than hives and problems breathing from Atenolol, Metropolol or some other thing I was on. Goodness, I cannot complain, this drug really helped me out. Thank you.

I have also had every side effect there is with it including pain in my arms and legs. I also have severe acid reflux and have to take an acid pill every day with it. It didn't start until I started taking this med. I only take a small amount and I am afraid to increase it because they say that it's very hard to get off of. I do know when I don't take it for over 24 hours my blood spikes very high. I don't recommend it to anyone. Try something else if you can because once you start taking it you will get very hypertensive.

Then you can't get off of it, when it has stopped working completely.  Stopping it at once will cause BP to go thru the roof, and it becomes dangerous for stroke and heart attackIt also causes headaches to get increasingly worse and worse as the dosage gets higher

52$Condition: High Blood Pressure$8/9/2011 11:49:45 AM$Reviewer: Frustrated, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$2$4$Ended up in the ER because I had shortness of breath, which I believed was a reaction to Exforge.  I was taking it and Tekturna (which doesn't work for African Americans I was told by the ER doctor).  Apparently he was right because my pressure was 200/128. They administered Clonidine to me in the ER to get my presurre down (and oxygen to help me breath although my oxygen level was fine, almost 100%. The ER doctor prescribed Clonidine .1 mg twice a day, Microzide 25 mg and Norvasc 5 mg. The same night I went home from the ER I had fast heart palpitations when I tried to sleep. This is the fifth day since I was given Clonidine and athough my pressure is much lower, 144/100, I had still have the heart palpitations when I go to sleep, itching and terrible night sweat (woke me out of my sleep last night).  My doctor says Clonidine is the culprit and that she will wean me off once in pressure is better.  I wonder what is the point, if it will spike again once she gets me off.  I tired alot too and can't walk long distances at my normal pace as I get winded. The heart palpitations and night sweat freaked me out and now I'm anxious about sleeping while taking this, but I can't just stop taking this med as warned and I don't want my pressure up again and in the ER.

58$Condition: High Blood Pressure$4/29/2011 1:36:04 AM$Reviewer: Fuzzy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$2$Changed to clonodine due to develpment of an allergic reaction to lisonopril.  Normal resting heart rate was upper 50s.  Med dropped that to low 40s.  Initially very tired first hour after taking a whole pill.  So I change to taking 4 half pills per day.  That has helped with the tiredness.  Still do feel tired and can fall asleep on a wink.  But, that's not so new with me.  Driving has me worried.  We like to take trips.  I've found that about 30 minutes in to a 2 hour drive I'm slapping myself around to stay awake.  I noticed that if I don't take the med at regular intervals, my bp jumps around a lot.  The bp wanders around if I don't stick closely to a 6 hour schedule.  I've experimented with 2-1/2 pills during the day and one whole pill at bed time.  That didn't do a good job of control.  I'm working on trying to stay awake all day.  I find that a real strong cup of coffee and a strenous long walk first thing in the morning helps me stay awake until noon.  Found that it is almost impossible to get my heart rate over 65.  More strong coffee mid afternoon and no long sitting gets me through that time of day.  I've always been a night person, so I'm o.k. in the evening.

My ongoing problem is that I am a physiologist, with a specialty in biochemical medications. W/o Clonidine, my BP would spike to abnormal levels and upon taking my .3mg dose ( 2x/day) the pb would lower to abnormal levels. Clonidine/Catapress are fast acting
short duration chemicals; regular daily dosing will result in rebound levels of BP. Ultimately I found ( for me) taking quarter doses (.016mgs) 4x daily keeps the blood levels in a safe range, does not provide all the nasty side effects and keeps the BP at a reasonable level. Using this drug "" as needed""  or at regular recommended doses seems to impair the function of these meds. I might add, even with regular low dosing, ""as needed"" dosing may still be required as per diet and environmental conditions change daily.

My doctor wanted me to try using this medication in a patch form since he's prescribed this med. to be taken 3 times a day. I couldn't handle the patch and it was not covered by my insurance. All I know is that Clonidine effects your central nervous system so if you're sleepy while taking it that's why. It can cause nightmares as well and lately I seem to be having my share. DO get your eyes checked yearly for clonidine can damage the retina. How can a drug company allow such side effects and not be stopped from marketing this dangerous drug. I wonder why I bother to keep taking it when it doesn't seem to help my BP.

The most intense and I'm dealing with right now is whatit does to my BLadder. I am  in  alot of pain in the bladder region with urgency and efrequency. I have been checked our for U.T.I which I get often enough with having I.C (Cystitis without infection), and I am convinced that this drug has flared me up in my bladder. I also get acid reflux from this drug as well. Have a feeling of :""La la land"" sometimes with this medication. I overall just feel sickly with taking Clonidine and unfortunately for me all the other B.P. meds have other bad side effects. Clonidine however is tough on the kidneys hence my dr. Quack should never have prescribed it to me because I have a chronic Bladder issue. RME. Hope  some have better luck with this because for me it isn't a keeper. 
NOt going to continue to take a drug that makes me sicker than before taking it. That doesn't benefit me at all. Good luck P.S. also upper reflux into mouth as well with Clonidine. You feel like acid coming up into your throat. badddd"

Ace inhibiters was causing a cough but they worked. On this drug for about a month still trying to regulate the amount. Was given 0.2mg twice daily but if I took that amount it put me to sleep. Now trying one half at night and one in the morning but still got me sleepy. So today going to one half early and one half about noon and see how that works. One pill in the morning dropped my BP way down to 111/67 much too low for me to function properly. At that level I was a little dizzy and off balance and had to force myself to get up and move around. We will see how this works breaking it up. Doctor does not seem to care they just write a perscription and say come back in a year.

After taking in the morning I could not stay awake and would fall asleep on the job, so with the Dr's permission I only take 1/2 tablet in the morning along with my other blood pressure medications which included a beta blocker.  I managed to stay awake as long as I was moving.  The minute I stopped moving I fell asleep.  I take 1/2 tablet in the morning and 1/2 tablet in the evening and one whole tablet before going to bed.  The pill causes me to dream nonstop plus getting up frequently to use the bathroom.   I barely get any sleep and now I have started having heart palpitations.  At first the pill would cause me to go to sleep at night but now I don't fall asleep rapidly and it feels like at times I'm about to have an anxiety attack.  I usually resist it by concentrating on something else.  I don't like this pill because now I'm afraid I'll never be able to get off of it.  Along with the other medications I take I am fatigued all the time, can barely do housework unless I do not take any of the blood pressure medication, then I experience a rise in my blood pressure.  The doctors have not offered me a substitution for this drug.  Is there one?  I have also had a hysterectomy and do not know what effect that has on my body concerning my blood pressure.

Insisted that my doctor taper off this drug. It has been four weeks now and I have two more weeks to go to get off this drug.While on clonidine,I was having dreams like I have never had in my life.  My BP would go up at night at times and I would take 0.2 clonidine to bring it back down. Sometimes BP would come down after taking clonidine.  I discovered deep breathing exercises brought BP down when I didn""t take the extra clonidine.  I am now on an ACE drug and HCTZ . My BP is down and I feel much better being off the clonidine;(just about). You have to get off the clonidine gradually or your blood pressure can go much higher than it was before you started the clonidine.  Follow your doctors advise when tapering off clonidine.   "

I have been taking this for almost 2 yrs now & still experience the overwhelming need to sleep after a couple hrs and the dry mouth w/o eating a fairly sized meal. 
Overall, my BP has been great! I can live with these side effects but question...Since I'm now 38 & a homemaker, will I ever be able to take this medicine and not need to sleep off the effects in the morning so I can eventually work?"

189$Condition: High Blood Pressure$10/7/2007 2:16:15 PM$Reviewer: Elkedzo, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug worked for 15 years before I needed to add a water pill (Bumex).  It still will lower the systolic about 50 degrees and the diastolic about 30.  After 27 years I am needing an additional med.  But all in all...this drug has no side effects and WORKS.

Am awaiting change to another drug,but have already reacted to so many--awaiting results of numerous tests to see if I am totally chemically intolerant.
