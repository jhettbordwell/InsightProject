I cannot say that this medicine does anything to help with pain or the tingling sensation I experience. I am now weaning myself off.

6$Condition: Other$12/18/2008 12:34:59 PM$Reviewer: No More Pain, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$"I suffered some type of damage during a torn miniscus surgery.  Due to the fact it started tearing 10 years prior, their was no specific cause.  They removed 5o% of the inner and 25% of the outer in my right knee.  I was taking six Vicodin per day for a year and a-half.  Which did not help the pain, it only calmed my frustration.  I found a great painmanagement doctor and am using it with .1 mg of clonidine per 25 mg Nortryptyline and it works better than the pain medicine.  I tried elavil and the side effects were too much, however, these are the best drugs for treating nociceptive pain.  The clonidine is essential for these medicines to work right.  My Pain Managment Doctor is also having me take 5000 IU D-3 per day.  You can google NOW FOODS and buy them cheap, plus they are extremely small.  Sugar will increase pain.  Since I have High cholesterol and it is not due to over eating, I am also taking 1000 IU Fish Oil pills per day.  NOW FOODS is the only company I have found that does not let you even taste or burp anything fishy smelling.  I do have increased anxiety, however, it is temporary and I refuse to live my life on Narcotic pain killers.  ****Crestor is best to treat high cholesterol because it raises your HDL (the good kind).  I am 6'3"" and 190 lbs (not overweight) with a cholesterol of 362 off medicind and 257 on it.  Make sure you watch it during treatment, as well as, liver, tox, and vitamin levels in your body.  ANY MEDICINE YOU TAKE WILL AFFECT HOW EACH INDIVIDUAL MEDICINE PERFORMS.  TRY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE."

I tahe 25mgs. and in all honesty, this drug is useless for me. I receive no pain releif benefits at all. this drug may work for others, but its doing nothing for me.

11$Condition: Other$11/30/2007 10:06:19 AM$Reviewer: pauluch, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$4$A good nerve pain drug, if Neurontin isn't obtainable.  90 mg at night makes you sleep like a baby, and takes that dull aching nerve pain away.  Until you get used to it, you will be groggy upon awaking.  It takes awhile to work (1-2 hours), but be ready for bed, cause it hits fast and hard.
