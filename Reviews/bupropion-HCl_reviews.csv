1$Condition: Stop Smoking$8/29/2019 7:42:21 AM$Reviewer: KGL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I started taking bupropion XL 150mg 6 days ago for smoking cessation and anxiety.  I am a 29yo female in good physical health. I read all the reviews about how it effects people with anxiety but I wanted to give it a try. LET ME TELL YOU: I do not recommend this medicine for anyone with legitimate anxiety or panic disorders. I was fine for the first 2 days and then I just started crying about things that normally didn’t make me cry. I chalked it up to hormones being I was approaching a certain time of the month. By day four I was just laying on the couch and had thIs deep feeling of sadness. I tried to push through anyway. Last night, however, I was inconsolable and had the worst anxiety I’ve had in months. I was terrified, sweating, crying, my heart was racing, and I felt like everything was crumbling around me. My thoughts were dark and I couldn’t talk myself down-which I usually can. None of my coping mechanisms worked and all I could do was wait for it to pass. On top of the fact that I never once felt the urge to not smoke! I stopped taking this medication this morning. I know medicine effects everyone differently and this is my first ever experience with an  antidepressant but jeez. I would rather quit smoking cold turkey than deal with this nonsense. It was like I took ten steps back taking this medicine. I’m glad to see and hear that it really helps some people and sometimes it’s worth pushing through and giving it a try. However, if you don’t suffer from depression or even have very mild depression I feel there are probably better options out there. This should not be the first course of action for people with anxiety and honestly, I blame my doctor for totally bypassing the fact that it is not recommended for anxiety sufferers in the first place. I wish everyone good luck and hope this helps so that other people like me don’t have to suffer.
2$Condition: Binge Eating Disorder$6/8/2019 9:06:45 PM$Reviewer: Francesca, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$So far so good. Felt a little weird and sick to the stomach the first week but now after one month I feel more normal with out the constant urge to find something to eat and I started a diet when I started taking it and its the first time in 4 years I've been able to stick to my diet without loosing control and having a carb/sugar fest. Lost almost 8 pounds in a month so I'm sticking to this. It also helps my PTSD by letting my brain rest and not running the same thing through my mind over and over. Stress seems to be lower. Social anxity still there but I'm a introvert by nature so not planning on being the life of the party any time soon either way.

5$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$4/7/2019 1:21:09 AM$Reviewer: Kat , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$It has made my anxiety much worse, and I’ve developed some sort of ‘OCD’. But, on that note, I do seem a bit more motivated. I’ve been on other meds for awhile and have been ‘numb’ since, so I’m not sure how this affected it, other than not making it any better.

Other meds SSRIs had disastrous results. Good for increasing or restoring dopamine. Little to no bad sexual effects. Been on it 11+ years now retired 10 yrs. Lifesaving med for me.

8$Condition: Depression$1/4/2019 11:44:46 AM$Reviewer: teechur, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"I started on Bupropion to deal with my depression after I'd lost a lot of interest in a lot of things I'd previously loved like running, competing, exercise, etc. I was crying a lot for no reason, and my previous good self esteem was in the toilet. It really helped with the crying, but it increased my anxiety dramatically and I'd never had anxiety before. I also feel it made my emotions very ""flat"". So instead of crying all the time I was having very few emotions even when I should be. I went from a formerly bubbly, motivating person (prior to the depression) to a quiet, withdrawn person who was too afraid to go outside and run and running has been my life for 15 years. I'm going to talk to my doctor about reducing the dose. "
9$Condition: Depression$1/3/2019 10:05:42 AM$Reviewer: guigeek, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking Bupropion HCI XL 300 mg for about 10 years.  It is the only medication that works for me with the least amount of side effects (dry mouth and itching). I do take an allergy pill as well. I don't walk around crying for no reason or get upset over little things. I don't have thoughts of wanting to die anymore.  I quit smoking, cold turkey, 3 years ago and have remained a non-smoker.  This drug has been great for me.
10$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/15/2018 4:42:39 PM$Reviewer: SC-Scribe, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$The drug screwed up my sleep cycle, and so taking it was very difficult. I wanted to give it a fair shake on the ADD, so kept at it. Then I developed odd neurological tingling / twitches in my fingers. Didn't associate it with the drug. THEN, a horrible neurological condition struck, and I was rushed to the hospital. It was hypokalemia -- low potassium -- and it was life-threatening. Bupropion, as it turns out, is associated with this. Ironically, my business partner's boyfriend was a few months later taking it for smoking cessation; she had to drive him to the hospital for the same reason. So just be aware!
11$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$10/12/2018 4:46:43 PM$Reviewer: Wednesday, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was initially prescribed 21 tablets of Bupropion XL 150 mg to take every morning for 3 weeks for depression and nicotine addiction. During the first week I felt much more energetic and somewhat euphoric at times. I also noticed my nicotine cravings begin to dissipate and I began having vivid dreams every time I went to sleep. In week two I had no nicotine cravings at all, but I started having frequent panic attacks and crying spells. By week 3 I was actively suicidal, and my prescriber discontinued my course of treament with this medication. It has only been one day since I stopped taking Bupropion and I feel like my normal depressed self again which I welcome back with open arms as opposed to the extremely emotional and impulsive version. I feel less focused and a little bereaved, but not unbearably so. On a positive note, the thought of smoking a cigarette or vaping nicotine is revolting to me. I hope it stays that way. 
12$Condition: Other$9/12/2018 7:11:28 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"18 years ago, when I was 22-ish, i started taking zoloft, and that was effective but it kind of made me feel dull.  So, after maybe 6-8 years I stopped taking zoloft.  
A couple years later, I started taking Adderall, and that allowed me to focus and not feel dull and still ponder my existence all at the same time.  
Several years later, I grew concerned about the long term effects of my elevated blood pressure, so I stopped taking adderall.
A couple years later, I heard of this alternative and determined to try it.
I have now been taking bupropion for two to four years.  
It does not seem to either inhibit or improve my focus (I have always been a fairly focused person), perhaps I fidget a wee bit less.  
Most importantly - I am able to execute my responsibilities for my work and family; I don't feel otherwise affected; my moods are my own; my thoughts are various and normal, as are my interactions with and reactions to ""people"" - although my stress levels still rise to unsustainable heights, I have worked on mindfulness to always be aware that I choose how to respond to every situation.

as a note, I have only ever taken the minimum dose for all of these drugs, with one exception when my doctor recommended upping the zoloft dosage- the increase had no noticeable effect on me."
13$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/8/2018 3:15:36 PM$Reviewer: diane, 65-74 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$4$I take this med, 300mg every morning. I have been using it for 16 yrs. I also take Trintllex, Lamotrigine, and Trazadone. I was in intensive care for three and a half days. I have been suicidal and in the hospital many times. About a week ago I accidentally stopped taking it. Yesterday I took it and was drugged and sleeping for six hours. I could barely get up. Has anyone had this happen.? It is not listed as a side affect.
14$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/23/2018 8:43:59 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I am bipolar Type 2. I have been on bupropion for at least 15 years. It has been a Godsend for me. Without it, I lack motivation. It has allowed me to live a very successful and fulfilling life. (It also helps keeps your weight down). The downside is that you feel pretty awful if you miss a dose, but I make sure that seldom happens. Not for everyone, I know.You need to eat while taking it. Can cause involuntary jerks and tardic dyskinesia (muscles work slower than your brain) if you donÃ¢Â?Â?t.  I also take gabapentin, which helps eliminate seizures, so I suppose they balance each other out. Also can affect your balance if you arenÃ¢Â?Â?t hydrated. But all this is worth it to me. You learn how to deal with it. Hope this helps!

I have extreme joint pain in my thighs, arm & thumb.  I am currently in the process of tapering off of Bupropion.  I am wondering if anyone else has had similar muscle / joint pains that have stopped & how long it took for you to feel normal again.  I am miserable!!
16$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$11/27/2017 11:25:45 PM$Reviewer: DesignerType, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"Bupropion has literally saved my life.  I didn't want to live before I started taking it.  I have been taking it for 17  years now.  The few side effects it has go away after about six weeks of taking it.  At first I was a bit shaky, had mild headaches, slight insomnia.  These side effects went away, but even if they didn't go away they were more tolerable than depression.  The brand name (Wellbutrin) works better than the generic (Bupropion) but unless you have $16,000 - $18,000 per year to spend you better use generic. (I'm not exaggerating this price)  Another tip:   I have found with the generic it's best to use the 100 mg three times per day vs. the 300 mg XL one time per day.  The generic XL (extended release) does not work for me.  It took me literally years to figure this out so...you're welcome.  :)   "
17$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/11/2017 1:00:59 PM$Reviewer: DB, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$4$Doctor gave me this to help with the anxiety that is caused by my ADHD/ADD until I could get in to see a psychiatrist. Must say it has worked wonders. The first day, it released the ADD and actually made it worse. Think of taking chains (anxiety) off the disease and letting it run wild. The second day was better. Noticed a little irritable at common tasks throughout the day. The third day, I was completely normal. I had motivation to get things done and haven't had any desire to procrastinate. The ADHD and ADD is still there and I can notice it but it doesn't make me anxious about it.

I am married  25 years my husband is not supportive, however, I have an excellent  psychologist.  I was relieved when I received a diagnostic of Bipolar Disorder, now I know what is ""wrong"". I am takin 75mg 3 pills daily, I  see some improvement. I am reaching out  attempting to socialize. I recently obtained a part time   teaching position. I am looking forward to resuming  activities I had stopped, art projects, I don't think about death and dying as much as I once did. I have lost weight. I don't drink because when I do I feel awful. I cannot tolerate loud noises, I attend church, and I am moving forward with my life and living.  Trying hard to remain in the present."

I have a history of depression and recently diagnosed with AdultADD. I did begin to notice a lil less procrastination more motivated to do at least 1 task. My moods have been upbeat more often. I smoke cannabis so my urge for that has decreased. Although, 3rd day in I woke up with the most painful headache stemming from last night. I thought if I sleep on it; then it will go away in the morning. It hasn't. To b cont'd.

I feel better, but I'm sure it will get even better than before.  My lower back started aching within 24 hours and I'm hoping this subsides.  I will tell my doctor in 3 weeks, but I see there are others with this symptom.
21$Condition: Depression$3/29/2017 4:45:48 PM$Reviewer: meggie, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$I had been on Lexapro 10 mg once daily.  I had lost my mother and brother within nine months of each other.  I was devastated.  My husband suffered a spinal cord injury at our summer vacation at ocean city in 2011.  I have been getting worse. My doctor prescribed bupropion 150 sr once daily two weeks ago in addition to the Lexapro. I have only been taking 75 mg as I have reactions to certain drugs.   I feel better during the day but still experience anxiety every morning.  I like to have an alcoholic drink but feel it does not agree with the bupropion.  Any advice would be so helpful. 
22$Condition: Depression$2/7/2017 10:24:41 AM$Reviewer: goodvibes, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I am very new to anti-depressants but after my anxiety attacks and depression getting out of control my doctor suggested them. I was on Zoloft for months but my sex drive went way down. My doc then put me on 300mg of Burpropion. I have been on it for about six months and the results are amazing. I feel like my normal self again and my sex drive also went back to normal. I had a little chunk before but I lost it all totaling 35 lbs of weight loss. I feel amazing. I am diagnosed with Depression and PTSD so for me this medicine did the trick! 
23$Condition: Depression$1/21/2017 12:26:54 PM$Reviewer: DEC, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"This drug saved my life, and probably my marriage. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever. I started on 150mg time release two years ago, and after six months increased to 300mg time release. I take it early every morning once per day, but do not find that it has any effect my ability to sleep. One artifact of taking Bupropion is that I can no longer drink alcoholic beverages without feeling awful, so I have quit drinking completely. This is probably for the best, as before I started using this medication, I drank heavily for 20 years in an attempt to ""self medicate"" my depression. Even though I still love the taste, I have no desire to drink anymore - I'm much happier living without depression than I ever was getting drunk. It seems a small price to pay for the miracle that it has performed in my brain chemistry. I still feel down and sad from time to time, but now it's because I have a reason for it, like people with normal brain chemistry. You're supposed to have mild depressed feelings when bad things happen, and so I've learned to distinguish between these feelings and the depression I lived with most of my life. I have more energy, am more motivated, and can retain my mental focus better than I have in years. I'm more willing to and capable of interacting socially with people, despite being a severe introvert. I'm less of a pessimist and generally more pleasant to be around now than before I began treatment. I wish I'd been prescribed it when I was a teenager, as I believe my life could have been so different. I wouldn't stop taking Bupropion at this point even if they tried to tell me that I didn't need it anymore. I expect to take it for the rest of my life, and I'm fine with that."

Over the years I have changed dosages from 300 to 350, from 450 to 400, back down to 300, recently back to 450. There is a persistent sadness tightly woven through the fabric of my emotions and feelings. I function fairly well most of the time. Sometimes I feel stuck. I don't want to do anything except space out. I get stuck in my own head like I'm withdrawn into my own bubble. None the less. the Bupropion has enabled me to get up off my ass and most forward with life. Whenever I feel super stuck, I check in with my therapist and doctor. Sometimes we tweak the dosage. I also think some generic brands are poor quality. If you can get Wellbutrin, do it. The generic stuff can be wonky sometimes and I'm not trying to play Russian Roulette with my life. Coupled with therapy and a sharp progressive doctor, I can manage.

However, I'm keeping it all in perspective and motoring through the bad stuff. Smoked for 35 yrs, been wanting to quit 4-ever. Feeling good about myself.

I have only experienced two side effects. My blood pressure has risen a little bit, it used to be in the typical range.  And I am frequently nauseous. My stomach doesn't hurt. The nausea is mainly due to my neck being sensitive. If I have a necklace on or something around my neck, I will gag a lot. And sometimes I throw up. But taking ompeprazole has helped with the nausea.  Overall I am thankful for the medication.

It took me almost 2 weeks to get up the nerve to actually swallow this pill because I was so scared of the side effects. I am so glad that I did..It has helped me tremendously. The first couple of days were alittle rough adjusting to the side effects. But they were really no worse than what I was already experiencing..Jittery, nervous,agitated,emotional. If you are scared of taking this medication..please don't be! I was diagnosed with depression and was having severe panic attacks. I was given Bupropion HCL Xl and Xanax. I started out on 150mg tablets for the first week then started on the 300mg 1 x a day. What a difference this medicine has made. I am much more calmer now and my mood swings have greatly improved. So please don't be afraid to take this medicine because of the ""bad reviews""..I was the same way I would read the reviews and talk myself out of taking it. Atleast give it a chance...I know I'm sure glad I did!"

Tried Paxil briefly when I was younger and had intense side effects- sleep, teeth grinding, sex drive, felt more miserable. Few years later tried the generic of Wellbutrin XL. Started the first month at 150mg and didn't notice too much, then up to 300mg and felt a near immediate substantial improvement. Much more energy, less likely to let sad thoughts fester, much easier to get out of bed in the morning.

Lost my health insurance and fell off the medication for about 9 months and the last three got bad. Started back up a few weeks ago and after a couple days adjusting (side effects of a sort of mild vertigo, trembly hands) I've got the energy back and feel more capable. It's shown me the possibility of a tolerable, if not enjoyable life."

50$Condition: Other$2/3/2015 2:58:55 PM$Reviewer: Jlock, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$3$I have been taking Bupropion HCL XL 150mg for about a month and a half.  The beginning stages of it made me very sick.  I lost about 10 lbs in a week because I couldn't eat.  That subsided.  It has given me a little more energy but I have bad anxiety and after a month of taking it starting having panic attacks again so we added back Paxil which is what I was taking.  That has helped but the only problem now is that the Bupropion has caused me to have heart palpitations all day every day.  I kept waiting thinking they would go away but that didn't work so I just started this morning on Bupropion HCL SR 100mg and still take the 20mg Paxil in the evening.  I really want to stay on the Bupropion to maybe balance out the weight gain caused by Paxil, to have some energy, and it has brought back my sex drive which was in the negative for a long time.  If the heart palpitations don't stop I will have to go off of it though and I guess stick with Paxil.  I can't go through trying a new drug again.  The side effects are just too much.......

I'm 61. I've been diagnosed with depression bordering on major depression. I've gone thru 4 knee surgeries and now I've had a pacemaker installed. All this happened within the last 18 months. I went from a wheelchair to walking with my cane during that time. I feel my body is breaking down. My exercise routine has been hindered. I can't do the things I could've done before. I have to accept that I'm getting old! All of these factors contributed to taking Bupropion. I have to tell my mental health provider on the next session; that I've increased my dosage. This stems from the latest problems that have transpired. I increased the dosage from 300mg to 400mg. I feel so much better. I see her every 120 days. She knows everything about me. Initially asking many questions ranging from my social life to my sex life. That's to determine what dosage I needed. The only problem; I can't get an erection. Bupropion has the least sexual side effect on that problem. I'll have to live with it. But it really upsets me. I feel that my male ego has been devastated. But life goes on. We review how things are going. She keeps my medical file up to date. We come to an agreement what dosage I need after discussing what's been going on in my life. She's really a great nurse practitioner. Someone to talk and listen to. I enjoy going to see her. I look forward to all of my future sessions with her.

I took it 5 years and have been off it 3 years, taken off this poison by a nonAmerican doctor who doesn't buy into the ""give-a-pill"" theory of medicine. Wellbutrin has changed my brain permanently. I was never angry before. Now I live every day very angry. My life is hell filled with anger. This medication is poison. Please, don't do this to your life and your brain. Run very far. I would give anything not to have taken this poison. I'm very sure my Medicare paid for the mags on my first doctor's Porsche. Eat right and exercise. Do not surrender to the ""medicines"" Rx companies give you. They don't care what it does to your brain. They only care about their profits. PLEASE, PLEASE take this seriously.

At first, I felt some occasional mild dizziness but that was only temporary and it was nothing serious.

No general anxiety, don't care to smoke, can focus better than ever. Without, I am situationally depressed with daily anxiety which causes me to smoke constantly. I wouldn't have an attention span to write this review. I don't feel as if I am on medication with this drug. NOW that's how you know its a good fit. If I forget to take it I can usually tell that I did within 24 hrs. Once I felt normal there was no turning back. Originally given this for postpartum depression when I started noticing all of my other tedious issues subside. I can honestly say that I never want to go back to feeling ""trapped inside crazy"" and that's exactly how postpartum felt. I would recommend this to anyone with similar issues. Especially adult ADHD. It takes about a month to take full effect and about a week of withdrawls to come off it. I can honestly say that I feel like a complete idiot with out it. The best time to take it varies from person to person. They say take in the morning but it makes me very tired. I take it before bed and about six hours on the dot I wake up every morning feeling refreshed and ready. I've heard that most take it in the morning just fine but I'm usually the exception with everything I take. NOTE: XL & SR are two different breeds. The SR made me feel like I was on speed. If you are the dead sleeping depressed than that should be just what you need."

I was on it 3 years ago. But stopped. Now, my nurse practitioner asked many questions stemming from my sexual activity, diet, contact with friends and family, church and other things. She compiled a history about me. She's a fantastic person. She decided my starting dosage would be two 100mg tablets; one when I wake up and the other at noon. We will discuss the dosage after two months. At that time she might increase my dosage. For me it is an appetite suppressant. I have some sexual side effects; I take Trazedone to maintain my erection. And it helps me go to sleep. You really need to work together to overcome depression. Overall Bupropion HCL works for me.

The only thing that helped me last night was taking 50 mg of the Pristiq again. I am stopping this generic immediately.  I would be willing to try the brand name Wellbutrin XL as I have read many reviews stating that the generic and brand name versions are very, very different.  I would be willing to bet that I would not have had this negative experience if my doctor had prescribed the the brand name version instead of the generic.  Now, onto Fetzima tomorrow.

We literally LIVED at the hospital for 6 months.  I couldn't see straight, through the anxiety and depression.  I thought I would never laugh, smile, sing, dance, or live again.  On Wellbutrin, which I'm taking in 3 sustained release tablets a day (300 mg), I can laugh, smile, sing, dance and live again.  I also take Sertraline (another antidepressant), but it wasn't enough.  Wellbutrin was added after months of Sertraline didn't help completely and made me VERY sleepy.  Wellbutrin helped a little with energy and significantly with mood.  I suppose if I got enough sleep, Wellbutrin could really help with my energy levels, but I'm happy enough being able to get up in the morning and stay awake at work (most days).  Seriously, on Wellbutrin I can laugh again.

It ended up being the only antidepressant I could take.  It helped with my energy level although I never really felt the same after the major depressive episode which put me on antidepressants in the first place.  It was very easy to come off of, no side effects but I felt a bit of a decrease in energy with an increased feeling of apathy, lack of interest, little enthusiasm.  After a couple of months, I started to gain weight for no apparent reason. I wasn't eating more; after another month or so the weight started increasing at a faster rate. Because of some other symptoms, I believe I need glandular support, mainly thyroid, so am taking supplements and natural remedies. I have begun to lose a little weight and the muscle heaviness I was feeling is subsiding. Of course I'm still seeing my counselor; working on relationships, self-esteem and lots of other stuff. If you're gaining weight after Bupropion and wonder if that is the reason, it very well could be. What's working for me is Iodine,Selenium,L-Tyrosine. I've always been a regular exerciser (running) but that wasn't keeping my weight under control like it always has, and it was becoming more difficult because of the sluggishness I was feeling, then the extra weight to carry around.

After two weeks on the higher dosage, the metalic taste is still there but not as bad.  I'm not waking up at night, and the other positive effects - like not freaking out about stuff so quickly/often have made me want to stick with it a little longer to see if the bad effects go away.

This was before it was prescribed for people who wanted to quit smoking.  I mentioned that to my doctor and he discounted it.  Whatever.  Bupropion worked very well for me with my chronic depression for a few years mostly by helping me focus and get out of bed in the morning.  I switched to Paxil when the side effects of clenching my jaws and muscle tremors outweighed the benefits.  Paxil was awful -- I picked my skin, drank too much alcohol, had no impulse control, couldn't cry, gained weight.  Tried Zoloft next -- suffered massive, gross skin sores; toe, foot and leg cramps; urinary incontinence.  Then tried Cymbalta which seemed like it worked, but was too expensive, so I went back to bupropion.  It's worked really well for a few months.  My skin is good again and my emotional responses are normal.  I can get up and go in the morning, even though I'm very wakeful during the night.  I lost my Paxil weight.  However, I'm bummed because I'm starting the jaw clenching again and feel that slide toward needing another change.  Ack!  At least I'll be retired in a couple of weeks and only my daughters and dogs will have to join me for my next medication ride.  I'm hopeful it'll be a smooth transition.

90$Condition: Other$2/28/2014 9:41:49 AM$Reviewer: moodbegone, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month$5$5$5$I have been on this medication for about 3 weeks now, and I am taking it for anxiety and a mood disorder from a very stressful life I have had for the past 10 years. I have to say that it's been very effective at controlling my anxiety and making me feel good on a constant level. Before I had ups and downs all the time, as there are more negative things in my life than positive. This drug has allowed me to feel better than I have been for a long time. I noticed that a lot of you are on other drugs, you should consider that the drug may not be effective because of these other drugs. Talk to your doctor about that. I am not on other drugs. Also I noticed that more females on here seem to find it ineffective, while most males find it effective. Not sure why that is. I am not disregarding the negative effects it may have caused for other people, just saying it has helped me. I am also not a fan of taking drugs, so I do not plan on being on it for a long time period of time. 
91$Condition: Depression$2/27/2014 6:29:20 PM$Reviewer: greengirl12, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$2$2$Buproprion HCL SR 150mg. I wanted to try Adderall for focus on school and general duties; along with depression, but doctor gave me this. Overall, this worked for me. I got out of bed, got done what NEEDED to, and lost weight fast,which motivated me more. After 1 week, I decided to get off it because of my circumstances...new job, school-had to perform as all eyes were on me, and most certainly felt that. The bad...I was overly self-conscious, my heart raced to where I felt tired but felt I had to do something because I couldn't sleep. My memory sucked...I felt spacey. Now, if I weren't in the new job with all this pressure, I would have stuck with it to see if SE went away. My question to ANYONE out there (please answer!!) is do these SE go away? Thinking to ask for half the dose and up it as needed. In the meantime, has anyone divided the tablet or is that not recommended with Extended release? Many thanks for any info. I am not on any other drugs by the way. Oh yes, another great thing...I am a heavy drinker which I found hard to stop but this helps and that is a wonderful thing...fewer cravings.

So far I am not impressed with it. I am currently also taking 150mg of Effexor Extended Release.  Was on 225mg Effexor until 2wks ago when doctor started me on Bupropion.  The Bupropion the doctor has me on is the immediate release one b/c she wants to see if its working since Im also taking the Effexor.  After I take the Bupropion I can feel the effects for about an hour, but after that nothing.  It makes me tired & sleepy.  Im thinking maybe my dose needs to be raised and I need to be put on the extended release tab instead.  I go back to the doctor in a week so I will voice my concerns then. 
98$Condition: Depression$1/23/2014 2:10:58 AM$Reviewer: berlinATX, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $3$1$5$"I had taken Wellbutrin for depression with successful results approx 10 years ago and had very favorable results: I had energy to get through the day, felt all-around better. But eventually it just stopped working (and I had reached the maximum dosage/day)I found the more I spoke to others who were taking the med (or had taken) said they had the same experience. 
Now I've been taking Prozac for the same reason and it works shockingly well but I have 0 libido...no more like -25 libido and have no highs or lows. Granted I'm not crying and it's helped my fibro-myalgia, improved my sleep and cut down on sweating but I'm a creative person and have lost all creative emotion. Enter Wellbutrin again. First day I've got pupils so dilated I can hardly function, massive anxiety, can't sleep, can't eat, nausea, everything smells strong and sickens me. I felt generally serotonin sick. I think if I had a benzo script I could muddle through but I've yet to have any psychiatrist give me one in over 5 years since Xanax got ""trendy"". Needless to say, I'm back at Prozac until I can even tell my doctor what happened. 
My advice is follow your gut. If you feel really horrible, it's probably not worth forcing it. I've done that with other meds like Paxil and wound up in the ER with mania and not a single doctor in the whole place intersted in or able to help...and that's scary."

The more he asked me questions, the more I finally realized that I was depressed and had been for a couple of years. I was having such negative dark thoughts and the doctor prescribed this to me with a high dosage immediately.  It took a few weeks but I am so glad I got help.  I started to feel better, had more energy where before I could barely make it through the day. I lost weight and started feeling more positive.  I experienced an increase in libido and a slightly decreased appetite.  I started exercising and although I've suffered some additional setbacks, I have learned how to deal with them and keep moving forward.  I have forgotten to take my pills for 2-3 days at a time and I have began to feel ""icky"" again.  I am a work in progress and I hope that one day I will be able to live pill free by exercising regularly and eating a clean diet...I am working towards that but for now I am very happy with this medicine.  As for side effects, I am lactose intolerant and have IBS so any nausea or other discomfort have been indistinguishable.  I have occasionally experienced dizziness and slight headaches but other than that, I have not significant side effects.  "

The first week felt euphoric. My brain felt like it was growing, or at least, I was accessing parts of it that I hadn't in a L O N G time. The first 2 months I had: lots of headaches, loss of appetite, and increased heart rates at times. It was similar to having too much coffee; I was jittery. After 2 months that all faded away. Now, 6 months in, I can see that during my menstral cycle, my symptoms have increased. More cramping and bloating. I didn't have those symptoms before, but now I notice that they are regular symptoms for me. Might be the meds, might be my body developing. I had occasionally smoked cigarettes - like 1-2 times a month. I am absolutely, positively NOT IN THE MOOD for a cigarette - ever. It is incredibly unappealing to me now, even as occasionally as I had done it.

The first month was full of each side effect they listed. Some of those side effects were from quitting smoking I'm sure.  The others, like dry mouth, being unable to sleep at all, racing heartbeat, and itching made me want to quit.  I'm glad I didn't because now I have a lot of energy, smoke 0-4 cigs a day (from a pack a day), and have been able to successfully quit a job and start a new much better one.  I don't think I would've been able to quit the job at all without this med.  It's mellowed out my thinking a lot. My boyfriend agrees.  I didn't see it as much of a big deal.  I'm happy with it.

After trying to take this for 2 weeks, I gave up & went back to what made me, temporally, happy. Yes, while taking this drug I did not have a real urge to smoke, but my mood, attitude, and thoughts were terrible. I was very aggravated with life, every big and small things pissed me off to the extreme. I felt like a robot most of the time. I would go to work/school, come home after it wore off, and hadn't really remember that I was an active person in society. My thought process was very clear, like never before. But being that I was able to think about my situation, that made me that more angry. It gave me a terrible taste in my mouth that I could not get rid of, & dry mouth. I've always had trouble sleeping, so I was given something more to help with that. I do recall smoking once, maybe twice while on this and it make me regurgitate. So I wouldn't recommend ""experimenting"" with this drug and maryGreen if you're 420 friendly."

I went and saw a psychiatrist instead of my primary care physician who knows nothing about mental health. The psychiatrist first started me on 150mg of Bupropion and advised me to continue to take the Cymbalta as well. The first week I could feel a major difference. I had a hard time sleeping at night but that went away after a week. But my feelings and moods were changing and I felt so much happier. Within the first month of taking 150mg, my appetite decreased, my energy INcreased, my moods became much more pleasant...and I was becoming a more positive person. But I was still feeling a few signs still of my Depression. My bed is my ""safe haven"" and where I go when I am depressed, I nap. I encountered about a handful of naps in that one month. I was still feeling like a worry-wart and had irritation issues. So when I saw the psychiatrist again after those 4 wks, he increased my dosage to the 300XL while still taking 120mg of Cymbalta. This is now my 2nd week taking this medicine with the increased dosage... and I feel absolutely amazing. I feel as though I have woken up from a deep sleep. I have so much energy. I can exercise because I have motivation. I am so much more pleasant with people at work and just in general. I can think rationally and be positive. I feel absolute love for myself. I no longer feel like a worthless, ugly, ashamed individual who could never leave the house. I feel A L I V E. I could literally hug my psychiatrist for listening to me and not over-medicating me. This medicine has helped me so much, you have to give it the full 4wks to feel the effects but wow. It has changed my entire life. "

I expect I will be able to get off of it completely in a year; but also expect to need to go on it again.

I have seen other sites where individuals described a ""honeymoon"" period when starting the Wellbutrin ( Bupropion ), then a difficult period with the side effects until the 6th week sometimes up to 12 weeks and then the drug began to work very well. That is my story as well. It was difficult and very scarey until then but worth the trip for me as I feel better now than I have in years."

I hated having to take this medication with food because it made me feel nauseous; other than that, I never had experienced other side effects.  I was instructed to take 300 mg a day when my doctor thought 150 mg was too small of a dose.  

I never felt a difference on either dosages; I was still very depressed and still had several crying episodes.  The feeling of sadness and emptiness still lingered.  I hoped it would help with my anxiety as well, but it didn't help with that either.  I'm not surprised by the ineffectiveness of this drug because I have never taken an antidepressant that has changed my mood and kept my anxiety at ease.  I wasted my money on this drug.  I no longer take any antidepressants or see a psychologist because it's a waste of my time and money.  "

I can say that within 2 weeks or so I wasn't so despondent and bleak.   I actually can say that I became euphoric and felt there was more to life than justing working, eating and sleeping.  I began to notice that I became very hyper and almost manic.  I started to snap at my family and employees (I'm told more than usual), and develpoed palpitations, hypertension, ringing in the ears, dry mouth, frequent need to urinate, horrible neck, and upper back pain, and difficulty falling asleep (which is already a know cause for depression...imagine that!  I was cut fromm 300 to 150mg and noticed 50% less pain.  Two days ago I quit cold turkey (per my Dr), and I HAVE NO NECK PAIN ANYMORE!  What is also odd is that I still have a feeling of euphoria, but less anxiety.  Maybe I never needed the drug, it just could have been a rocky time in my life.  There is so much evidence regarding the placebo effect.  I hope that this is the case.  If my depression returns, I will believe that it was truly the wellbutrin than helped.  I am going to attempt Buspar for my anxiety.  I'll comment in a few months if anyone is interested.

I actually was having bad anxiety before i started it and have been on it a few wks and anxiety decreased some. But i imagine it will affect different people differently. Took my stomach a long time to adjust to new meds even taking with food but its improved after about 2 wks now. Sleeping has still been trouble to stabilize but i haven't been taking 2nd dose at consistent same time trying to figure out what works best. Not needing as much sleep compared to before i started taking it. And the important thing if it has improved my depression-I have only been on it for about 2 or 3 wks so know it won't be fully working yet. Depression improved slightly but hard to tell if it has to do with meds or other factors of things going on in life at this time. Still hoping for the best...

I wanted to get away from the SSRI/SNRI meds so I suggested Wellbutrin to my doctor as an alternative. He had some reservations but started me on the 75mg immediate release Bupropion. One tablet for two days. No problems so the dose was increased to two tablets per day for the next ten days. At this point I was feeling a bit ""wired"" with some muscle twitches and difficulty sleeping. I believe these are typical with this medication. Also had a slight headache. Not real bad but always there. At this point I am wondering if this is the right medication for me. Feeling ""different"" but not really getting the relief that I wanted. I went to three tablets per day for about three weeks. Still having some issues at this point but I was seeing some benefits. Went to four tablets for the next ten days with much improvement.
   My most recent prescription was for Bupropion HCL 100mg taken three times a day. After about six weeks into this I feel much improved and confident that this medication will work well for me. Do not discount the effectiveness of this medication too quickly as there are some rough spots to get past before any benefit is seen.
   I did use low dose Klonopin to take the ""edge"" off the Bupropion. I did not need more than 1mg per day at the most and I am at a point where I believe I can stop it completely. The sleep issues have been resolved nicely with a 10mg dose of Doxepin at bedtime.
   Each individual is different as to the medications that work best. This is working for me.

My doc said to take 150mg each of the first four days, then 300mg per day. I didn't notice much of anything at all the first there days, but on the fourth day, I woke up at 4:00, feeling cranked up, then I thought I'd go ahead and take the fourth day's dose. That last dose was horrible. It felt like I had drunk a couple of posts of black coffee after missing sleep for about a week.

I troopered on and increased my dose to 300mgs, thinking I was just going through an acclimation period. Wrong! I had all the irritable side effects, the tinnitus, the insomnia. It was very similar to speed except without the horrible crash during the wearoff.

Finally, I called my doc and told her it was no good. She said I could cut the pills in half but that they would no longer be SR since the innards would be exposed. On the 75mg twice a day dose, sometimes I thought I was doing all right. But then the next day would be awful again, especially the insomnia. I cut the pills again, down to 37.5 mg twice a day, and I feel almost nothing except tinnitus and sometimes insomnia, but not as bad. There's no good side on this low dose, however. One good thing, unlike SSRIs, there's no ejaculatory disfunction on this drug. It even makes you sort of horny."
194$Condition: Depression$4/14/2011 2:54:00 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I started burpropion (generic version of Wellbutrin) almost a year ago after a tragic suicide left me with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was first prescribed Celexa which was great, but I had gained weight. So a few months later, my doc prescribed me Bupropion in addition. I was on 10mg/once a day Celexa and then prescribed 150mg/twice a day Bupropion. I had horrible side effects from the Bupropion- I felt drunk, sea sick, nervous, loss of appetite, couldn't sleep, woke up often in the night etc.  The 150mg/twice a day proved to be too much, and actually caused more anxiety than I started with. Sometimes going for a higher dose isn't the right answer. I went down to once a day dose of 150mg and it was magic! Together with celexa, I have gotten a hold of my depression/anxiety/OCD/PTSD. And, I have lost the 10 lbs I gained when first starting Celexa- yipee! If considering, or becoming discouraged with this drug- try out lower doses! Also- I'd suggest giving any SSRI medication at least 2 months to let the side effects wear off. I have absolutely no side effects now, and happy as can be!

I could definitely see this helping anyone for weight loss since I didn't want to eat anything even when I was hungry. But for anxiety, it made mine much worse. I also felt completely in my head and unable to control myself. I was having a difficult time controlling what came out of my mouth, which is scary in the office...i had to stop taking it.

My advice to anyone taking it is please wait a full month before you decide it isn't working (extenuating circumstances aside like if your suffering severe side effects then by all means consult your doctor) but I have felt better and better everyday since taking it. This has been my wonder drug and has given me my life back. I can concentrate better and have gotten my motivation back to pursue my personal goals in life. I hope everyone has the same results as I did. If you haven't don't give up there is something out there that can help you, and it is so worth it in the end.

Can say it definetly helps with the smoking. For the depression it is hard to tell. it gives me more energy but i am irratable and angry for no reason alot of the time and small things will just set me off now. Also have had bad ringing in ears periodiocally and can't stop clenching my jaw. finally realized what was making me do it.Bad dreams at night but might not be from this. Also seem more anxious especially in public. Foods taste different especially things i used to enjoy i don't like anymore.

I haven't really noticed any big differences except this week would've been my BIG mood swing time of the month and I didn't have any. It is definitely cutting down my appetite which is great, as a result of my depression I was dwelling on situations and would eat or drink late at night and basically binge on snacks. I will take my 30 days dose and if I notice any bad side effects (like hair loss, ringing in ears as I have read on here) I will request to be changed to wellbutrin which who knows if my insurance will cover. I am going to Mexico in 2 weeks and they sell the brand name Wellbutrin for $100 a bottle with no prescription needed, I guess I will see if my insurance will cover it first. I've taken it in the past and my sex drive multiplied by 10 which was great as my depression had diminished my sex drive and general interest in anything. So far Buproprion hasn't changed sex drive but it's only been a week."

I was put on it for my anxiety issues which literally kept me up every single night.  I can now sleep through the night which I can not be more thankful for!  However, the last couple of months I notice myself becoming more and more aggitated and going back to how I was in that sense.  I really do not like the idea of being on a pill and I even faught it for some time, but it got to the point where I wasn't living my life at all.  This pill has helped me regain some control over my anxiety, but I can tell it is slowly wearing off if this makes sense to anyone.

I have a little lift (no jitters), sleep fully and peacefully through the night without dreams, dry mouth is gone (I make sure to drink plenty of water now)I have stable energy through the day, I am not hungry or anxious about food (lost 9 lbs with South Beach diet in two weeks)- unfortunately, my libido - no change so far:(  However, I read it could take 6-7 weeks to fully take effect, so here is hoping!!)
I still get emotional during appropriate times (sad movies)- so I am definitely not a Zombie!
Once the libido increases, definite 5 stars for both effectiveness and satisfaction."

My doctor initially put me on 150mg/1x a day, but then raised it to 150mg/2x a day.  Almost immediately, I experienced positive results.  It was working so well for me, that I jokingly called it my ""happy pills"".  Everything seemed to be going quite well, no side effects, no more panic attacks, etc.  Then, on December 13, 2010, out of the blue, I had a grand mal seizure.  I had never had a seizure in my life previously.  A month+ later, and major testing having been done, from CT scans, to MRIS, EEGs, EKGs, carotid artery sonogram, sonogram of my heart, stress test EKG and an event monitor...not to mention numerous trips to a cardiologist and neurologist...it was finally determined that the seizure was caused by the bupropion.  Apparently, this drug can lower the seizure threshold in people...and at one point was removed from the market due to the fact that it was being administered at higher levels (than what are currently recommended), and it was causing a high incidence of seizures in people.  I think far too many people are unaware of that fact.  Don't misunderstand though...if I could take it again, and know I wouldn't have a seizure, I would do so in a heartbeat, it worked that well for me.  Just be aware that it can cause seizure issues...but if you can take it with no side effects, IME, it worked extremely well."

I just feel better. I am in less pain and no longer dwell on things for long periods of time. There was some feelings of agitation for a couple hours after taking a dose at first, but this passed after about two weeks. I sometimes have a light ringing in my ears, and I seem to get overly excited from time to time (a new feeling), a small price to pay for feeling better. Recommend starting with a very small dose and SLOWLY building up, that's what I did.

I think it was probably a panic attack at the idea of quitting smoking in the first place. The second week I felt fine, started cutting down rather effortlessly. This is my third week and am happy to say I have not had a smoke in 3 days. I suddenly want to get rid of all my ashtrays, throw away my lighters. My only caution...DO NOT DRINK ALCHOHOL WHILE TAKING THIS DRUG. It will mess you up and make you feel totally toxic in a very bad way for up to 48 hours after only having 2 drinks. Needless to say, once that occured, I have not had a drink in 2 weeks either. I am assuming that a good thing for me. All-in-all, I feel great now.

After a week of this medication, my doc wanted me to up the dosage to 2 pills daily. During my very first day of taking this medication I had adverse reactions.  My heart beat increased and I felt somewhat anxious.  Several days later I began taking the 2 pills per day as prescribed.  I noticed my neck began itching and had red blotchy spots appeared. Not only that but I became quite irritated and my husband said I was ""a bear"" while on this stuff. One of the most unpleasant effects was that I began ""clenching"" my teeth together and noticed an awareness in my teeth I'd never experienced before. This alarmed me so I called my dr's office. The nurse suggested I go back down to one pill again and come back in and see the doctor.  I have since been taking Sertraline (generic of Zoloft) with less adverse effects.  I have been on it now for almost 3 weeks and it's already much better than the Wellbutrin SR ever was.  The only good thing about this med is that it didn't have any bad sexual side effects...if anything it increased sexual desire.  But the bad far outweighed the good on this one."

I guess my beginning was uneventful, because I don't recall any adverse reactions. In retrospect, I did have vivid bad dreams and night sweats that I attributed to menopause. At my last check up my doctor suggested that maybe I didn't need this drug anymore. We tapered from 100 mg. a day to 100 every other day, t0 100 every third day.  I have not been on any for about two weeks.  Starting on the day I reduced I have had gastrointestinal symptoms I never expected-- slight nausea, severe diarhea, burning in the top left of my abdomen, extreme thirst, tiredness, a bit of a headache.  I don't really think there have been psychological withdrawal symtoms, except that I find myself thinking that what I really am feeling gastrointestinally are signs of some horrible fatal illness (anxiety?).

I have been on several medications for depression and I have found that in my case it wasn't so much the drug as it was the dosage and combination of drugs.  Granted I have been diagnoses with major depression, as well as cancer, so the multi drug treatment isn't always for everyone.

Before Bupropion I was glued to my couch feeling bad for myself. I ramped up to 150mg before I really got motivated because I was also on Citalopram. With the motivation came high anxiety and clenching of my teeth which gave me headaches. I felt like I was on drugs all the time.

Finally, we reduced the Citalopram to 5mg, reduced Bupropion SL to 100mg and added a little (2.5mg)of Zyprexa.  Now I'm human again and I don't feel like I'm on drugs.

Warnings: Zyprexa has caused me to gain weight but worth not feeling like I'm on drugs. One last thing.  I've tried several drugs and none got rid of the ringing in my ears.  I just humm to it instead."

Benifits- I have a lot more energy, Sleep so good on this stuff. I used to have bouts of getting maybe 9 hours of sleep in a 7 day peroid. Now I sleep 9 hours every day. So of course that has helped the, being a meany from lack of sleep syndrom. And of course the reduction of smoking. Don't know if I will ever totaly be able to give them up. Been smoking for 39 years. But for now am happy with how much I have cut down. Would highly recomend this drug for anyone who wants to quit or cut down. But I also haven't exsperienced a lot of the side effects others have.  So I guess, to each his own and good luck.

Release is not consistent, complaints were made to FDA, FDA followed up and determined that it was 50% effective and therefore equivalent.  NOT TRUE !  I take the generic made by Anchen (?) and have had no issues.  It even looks like the Wellbutrin brand.  Walgreen's carries TEVA in my area (because it's the cheapest) ... my grocery store, Schnucks, carries the Anchen generic.  Good Luck !!!

The next 2 weeks my husband told me that my mood swings were worse then ever and when I thought back to conversations I have had with clients or classmates, my husband was right, I did have a very negative attitude. I didn't quit smoking because I found my self smoking twice as much and the day I did try to quit I became severly deppressed and had suicidal thoughts(I have never had thoughts like this before) So I quit the medication and started to smoke again.

My health care provider prescribed it in addition to fluoxetine, which helped with my symptoms but made me feel drowsy and lethargic. On the bupropion (150mg SR in the morning) I couldn't sleep, I was jumpy, my brain felt like I was full of electrical zaps. I felt less inhibited, but this was actually a bad thing -- I didn't trust myself to know what was and wasn't appropriate to say or do. It was kind of terrifying, actually. I felt like I just wanted my self back. I can tell I would have lost weight quickly if I had stayed on it for any length of time. I was way overstimulated by it. Wished it had worked out, but it most definitely wasn't for me. Right now I'm on a very low dose of fluoxetine (10mg) to minimize side effects. Hoping to get off of it completely, but at least it helps when I need it without messing me up that much.

Initially, and still (after 2 months), I noticed that while I can reach a physical climax and ejaculate without any problem (unlike with Prozac where this had become difficult), the ""rush"" felt in the brain is missing -- no toe-curling reaction that leads to the afterglow feeling. More of a ""that's it?"", kissing your sister kind of feeling.

Recently, I have noticed a complete loss of libido - no interest in sexual stimuli that is usually a turn-on. I don't know if this is bupropion-related or not; I don't see sexual side effects listed at this website. In fact the reason I switched from prozac to bupropion was to reduce sexual dysfunction, which it has to some extent.

I wonder if anyone else has experienced these symptoms?"

I was overly angry at a friend of mine for something minor and the anger and aggitation wouldn't go away and carried over to other things like my pen running out of ink.  My eyes dilated and I couldn't hold still and I had tremors all over. Seeing as I'm not manic to begin with I'm never taking the generic Bupropion again.  Doc switched me to Wellbutrin XL (brand name) and we'll see how that works.  I'll review that on Wellbutrin's profile though.

On the fourth day I noticed a decrease in appetite and a bit of jitteriness.  I thought I might lose some weight!  That night I had a total meltdown.  While lying in bed trying to fall alseep, for no apparent reason I had the worst anxiety attack I have ever had.  I had the most horrifying and disturbing thoughts - things I am not capable of doing to those I love.  My husband sat up with me until I was finally able to sleep.  I stopped taking the drug immediately and felt better in a day or two.  It was extremely scary - felt like a ""bad trip"" I had once as a teen.  I won't take another anti depressant after that.  I don't know how drugs like this help people. "

314$Condition: Depression$1/1/2009 10:41:44 PM$Reviewer: SomethingsGottaGive, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$Well when takin alone, this stuff really works.  I tried every other drug before this one, and I must say this was the easiest for me to adapt to in regards to side effects.  However I was also givin Lorazepam with it which I ended up abusing and then even using alcohol and marijuana on top of it.  My advice would be to just take the bupropron sr alone with nothing else.  Alcohol and marijuana do not mix well with this.  I was feeling great after two weeks of taking this med but then started smoking pot again, and within 2 days I was back to my depressed self.  I stopped the lorazepam because I felt tired all the time and bupropion is supposed to make me wired, not tired.  So in the end, I realized to get better, I would have to ditch all my bad habits, and subtitute them with this drug, bupropion.  If you smoke pot or drink or do any other kinda narcotics, I would suggest not doing them at all if you truly want to get the full benefit of this medication.

I used a generic non timed release and found I actually experienced withdrawal symptoms between doses.

Even though I only used drug for a few weeks I have never had an urge for another cigarette and that was about 5 years ago.

When the SR and XL came out, I was switched to those and continued to do well. Now that BCBS won't pay except for generic, I went on Budeprion and had to double the dosage to get the same effectiveness. I never had panic attacks before but they started and I thought they were due to birth control pills I began taking to deal with bleeding problems. THEN, I did mail order and they gave me BUPROPION (not Budeprion) - it went rapidly downhill from there to the point where thoughts of harming myself occurred for the 1st time in years. Realized they gave me even the wrong generic - note the syllables - had to call my doc, the insurance, cuz it would've been $125. Still having problems with insurance cuz of mail order - never gonna do that again! I still have problems with any generic and wish the brand name was affordable. They shouldn't play with people's lives - generics are not as effective! "

My doctor told me to quit within a week of taking it, but I read in multiple sources that you could quit after taking it for up to two weeks.  I quit after taking it for two weeks, and up to that point I had no problem cutting back from 1 pack a day to the day before I quit, only 2 cigarettes the whole day.  Today makes 2 weeks that I haven't smoked a cigarette, and I don't really miss anything, have any cravings or withdrawal symptoms, and found that I don't even really need the nicotine lozenges I bought.  Additionally, I have experienced an overall feeling of better health, and I think that I am benefitting from the drug in other ways.  I am considering asking to be kept on this medication, the results are really great.  I haven't noticed a single side effect that I can directly contribute to the drug.  I have been and will continue to recommend it to anyone who wants to quit smoking...IT WORKS!!!

334$Condition: Stop Smoking$7/8/2008 4:40:49 PM$Reviewer:  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year$5$5$5$I started on this medication 6 months ago to quit smoking. I felt such an improvement in my mood and disposition that I asked my doctor to let me keep taking it even though I have already quit smoking. I think the reason why it was so hard for me to stay off smoking was because I was self-medicating my depression symptoms with nicotine. I don't miss it a bit now. The first day I took this medication I had vivid dreams that were somewhat sexual. I have had an increase in sexual desire since starting it but I don't know if it's the medication or the relief of depression that is the cause. I get an occasional headache that lasts for a few seconds and goes away. These are rare about 4 or 5 times a week. It does make my mouth dry and I relieve that by chewing sugarless gum or eating sugarless lifesavers. I have had no change in my weight or eating habits, I am not trying to gain or lose weight. I have had a huge increase in my energy and ability to organize my time. My depression was causing me to be lethargic and disinterested and I did not realize it. Occasionally I have trouble sleeping on this medication but I do not feel tired during the day. I have not had any problem with drinking alcohol while taking it. Overall I give it 5 stars and would recommend it for mild depression.

I have been on the drug for 2 years and during that time span, it's probably happened 10 times. The morning after I have had a drink or two, I will wake up in bed with the room spinning violently, feeling like I have been slammed onto the floor, and I have to get up and stumble dizzily to the bathroom in order to get sick. My doctor said that you can still drink while taking this medication, but that it will increase the effects of alcohol- so you feel drunker on less booze. However, the vertigo has increased ever since I increased my dosage to recover from S.A.D. Now, I've woken up with vertigo twice in the past week. I think I need to not drink any alcohol for a couple weeks to see if it gets better.

However, I am glad that I started taking it, because Bupropion has been very helpful in treating my depression and has allowed me to do better at work, as well as given me the energy to pursue the things I know I want out of life."

I was able to wean myself off the sleeping aid after two months and have only had a few bouts of insomnia since.

It generally worked well for me, though I recommend starting on a low dose and gradually working your way up to help minimize the side effects. I found it to be much better than the SSRI's as I tend to be sensitive to the sexual side effects and prone to weight gain. I generally felt good on wellbutrin and it didn't sedate me like so many others. The problem I noticed was that I was suddenly having trouble with receding gums. My hormones are changing and I told myself it must be related to that. However, I remembered that I started to have difficulty the first time I was on it, but then no further problems after I had gotten off of it. But once I was back on it, my dental exams had gone downhill drastically. Coincidence? It seemed unlikely that it would be related to this drug. Yes, it causes dry mouth, but receding gums? I haven't found anything about this in all of my research. Still, it seemed pretty drastic a change since I got back on it. I listened to my intuition and got off of it. I went from needing ""deep cleanings"" every couple of mos. to regular cleanings every six mos. and things have stabilized. Hmmmm...."

360$Condition: Other$1/6/2008 6:19:13 PM$Reviewer: Suzanne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I had been taking Effexor for a little over a year and it worked extremely well for me, but I did gain some weight from taking it, so my doctor changed me over to Wellbutrin and I absolutely hate it. I have never been so miserable. I have horrible side effects. It is supposed to help my anxiety, not make it worse. I am constantly anxious and my heart feels like it is beating out of my chest. I am going to stop taking and start taking effexor again, so that I can feel like a better, normal person. I would rather have a few extra pounds and feel better than to feel anxious and sick 24/7.

I've only been on the medication two weeks but to a point that I'm scared for my health. I've also noticed an increase in my blood pressure. Tonight while at the movies, I could barely catch my breath and my heart was beating so hard that I thought I was having a heart attack...I had to leave the theater and get some fresh air and catch my breath. Evidently  this isn't the drug of choice for me.
362$Condition: Depression$12/26/2007 4:56:21 PM$Reviewer: mr. c, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$5$I have just started useing this medication and at first all I had was a little weird feeling in my head for the first few days.  Now after using it by it self ( I started it with smaller doses of the drug I had been useing ) for a week or so, the same feeling I had before is back, even I am not at the full dosage yet.   I called the doctor who prescribed it and was told to use for a few more days, to see if the side effects go away.  But if I feel like I do now I will most likely go off it.
363$Condition: Stop Smoking$12/13/2007 10:51:16 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$1$3$I am experiencing nearly every side effect this drug has except seizures and very rapid speech. I rarely get headaches, and I'm generally in good health. I've had a headache for over a month, with the first 2-3 weeks very severe including vomiting, diarrhea, cold sweats, and pounding headaches triggered by anything that got my heart rate up, like turning over in bed when I awoke. My ears have been plugged/ringing the whole time as well. My body temp is 97*, and for the first time in my life, I've had serious suicidal thoughts.  I'm raising hell at my work. I have to take this info to my boss in the AM to explain my behavior. I'm a fool for trusting the five health care professionals I went to for help. I had faith in their knowledge and assumed they would do routine look ups of a med I'd been on for months. I was sitting on my couch having a panic attack for the first time in my life so I desperately went to WebMD. In sixty seconds I new more about my severe condition than three trips to the ER(Spinal Tap,CAT Scan, useless pain killers), my own doctor(different pain pill), and the help line (Go to the ER) could tell me. I just want to know, how do I get off this stuff? Dose changes amplify the symptoms, I know. I'm stopping the med. I hope this is the cause. I am a mad man and my brain hurts like physical damage, but at least I don't smoke.

She committed suicide 11 days later.  BEWARE of rapidly emerging suicidal thoughts!!! Don't take TEVA Pharmaceutical generic as it is shown to have greater side effects.

This has been the only drug that doesnt make me tired or hazy or constantly hungry and craving carbs.

376$Condition: Depression$9/27/2007 4:07:15 PM$Reviewer: FargoUT, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"After the loss of a loved one, I fell into a severe depression.  I still struggle with those feelings, but Wellbutrin XL (or the generic now) has helped immensely.  I'm on a 300mg/day dosage which I take in the morning.  It has allowed me to get past the feelings of worthlessness and near-paralyzing sadness.  

The only problems I've had with Wellbutrin is a reduction in my sex drive, an infrequent side effect of this drug. Maybe I'm just lucky.  I also highly recommend not stopping usage of this quickly.  I stopped for a couple weeks then started up again, only to have my internal chemistry sent into a tailspin.  For almost three weeks after, I had to deal with severe anxiety, sadness, depression, almost to the point where I needed to visit the local emergency room.  My system has since re-balanced, but I highly recommend not following in my footsteps.  Continue using or talk to your doctor before cessation.  "

378$Condition: Stop Smoking$9/19/2007 12:03:01 PM$Reviewer: [email protected], 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$My ratings speak for themselves, although the constant bowel cramping, if related to the use of bupropion, is quite uncomfortable. Haven't smoked in over a month now.
