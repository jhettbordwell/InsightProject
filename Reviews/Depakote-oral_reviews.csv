I read a comment below saying that you would reather gain weigh and be sain than be skinny and in sain.. Sound familar I said the exact same thing now I have gained about 100 pounds and have more health issue do to weight gain.. I did the whole health class that tells you to whatch what you eat that wasn't it. it was the meds.. I know it because when I took myself off I lost 22 pounds in less than a month without diet or exercise.. So you may get to a point when you are torn.
I had to choose to live and be a lil off balance than to make all my doctors happy and stay medicated.I think this a great med but the sideeffect were devistating I have more health problems then my grandmother and I fight with my ups and downs but I try to walk myself through it to know that what ever I am feeling at the moment will pass.I will not always be UP or Drown for too long a period and with this in mind I never crash to hard on my lows.. I am learning how to control myself.. This is not for everyone just for me.. I just want yall to know that if you keep gaining the weight from my exsperience it never stopped for me until I stopped the med.. Best of luck "

My capacity to do daily things was gone, especially paying bills and concentration. I was constantly dizzy and could not walk downstairs, I was on this medication for 6 to 8 weeks and my problems with it did not improve over time. I had server changes in my moods and personality. My doctor told me the hallucinations were not from the drug but from being manic, however the worse effect I have ever had while being manic was the inability to sleep. I never have had hallucinations before and have not had any since I stop taking this medication.

Mood, affect, and sociablilty much improved.  Previously on lithium for 4 years alot of side effects wasn't aware of.  Like peeing all night so couldn't get but 2-3 hours solid sleep dr prescribed med to help bladder control and sleeper instead of getting off lithium. none of the other meds worked by the way.  so the last 4 years very sleep deprived. you can imagine what that does to a persons mood and personality let alone being bipolar.fatigue, muscle aches , hair loss all from lithium.  Maybe a little thinning so far from the depakote, hard to tell but being a woman it's not a real plus.  by the way my dr wanted me to continue on the lithium even though my thyroid got way out of wack  and I kept saying something was prompting me to get off of it onto something different.  so i had to be my own patient advocate and push.  just remember your dr is not god, talk to others, get a second opinion if needed, bring someone with to appointments.

I was prescribed this medication and experienced some very nasty side effects like difficulty breathing and irregular heart palpitations. My doctor told me that the medication was safe and tested however upon further researching the drug I found out that it is actually new and the way in which it actually effects the brain is unknown. I highly suggest reading the printout before taking this drug and strongly recommend getting off of this drug as soon as you can if you can; BUT please don't suddenly stop taking this medication it could lead to fatal long lasting seizures."

37$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/13/2012 7:56:29 AM$Reviewer: Julie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$3$I have been taking Depakote for approx 2 years. At first I took Depakote in the morning, which resulted in me not being able to function during the day.I discussed this with my psychiatrist who advised me to take my medication before going to bed.This has worked well, I sleep better and funtion ok during the day - sometimes feeling a little tired.I take Depakote, Fluoxetine and sometimes Propanolol for anxiety.Depakote suits me and my mind is very much calmer with no racing thoughts and I am more able to keep things in perspective.I am now able to get myself to the gym - which helps greatly with my moods.I would recommend Depakote, but,I do appreciate that what I have read in other reviews that it is definitely not for every one.I began to begin feeling the benefits of Depakote a month after starting it.I no longer get crazy mood swings, so for me this drug works well - although I am concerned about its toxicity levels etc.Now that I am feeling more balanced I combine my drugs with eating healthily and getting lots of excercise.This is a massive improvement as I used to suffer from low self esteem and lack of confidence. I hope that if you try Depakote that it works as well for you as  it has for me. I now have far more good days than bad.

For mentally stability the medication is a great help however there are risk. I was told I was to have an MRI and EEG done as well to see what kind of damage has been done to the brain from possible swelling. Do you research. If your on the medication please make sure your doctor is ordering all the proper blood work and note that ammonia levels must be put on ice to get a correct reading.

47$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/15/2011 4:40:17 PM$Reviewer: veryvermilion, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$"I started taking this drug 6 weeks ago.  I was ready for weight gain, but the opposite has happened.  I no longer find myself craving fatty, starchy, fried foods.  
The other side effect that I was shocked to have is a marked increase in my libido.  I feel like a 20 year old.
I do not like feeling so drowsy.  It has slowed down my overall system so much.  I can't get up and going until about 2pm or later.  For years I was up and out of bed by 7am or earlier.  I am considering reintroducing caffeine to my diet.  With years of anxiety, I stopped using caffeine.  Now with this medication, I'm thinking that maybe a little will help me to get going earlier in the day.  
Also it has my slowed my GI system.  I'm not constipated, I just am not as ""regular"" as I was prior to the drug.  I'm taking fiber supplement and eating tons of veggies/fruit to combat this side effect.
It's helped with my terrible anger problems.  I'm not nearly as obnoxious on the road as I used to be.  
It amazes me at how different every one's response to Depakote is.  It just goes to show that we're all unique.  
I feel very lucky to have found this medication.  I just hope I can combat the drowsiness and GI problems."

New Psychiatrist thinks I'm bipolar and I'm taking generic form.  I insisted aftr 9 days to be changed from this medicine.  I hate it! I am now being weaned slowly off this to Lamictal.  I am more manic than ever, can't think, slurred speech swear I can hear my brain waves (no not a headache or ringing in my ears)at times.  Weak, but hyper. I've spent the last 4 days in the bathroom with bowel movement issues, had a super heavy and clotty menstrual cycle, and now I think I have a Urinary Tract infection (burning while peeing for two days).  I am still taking generic xanax, but nothing for the depression.  I see in the webmd warnings that you must be cautious if you have depression and suicidal thoughts.  Not to mention, I'm seeking a new psychiatrist!  I can't wait to be off of this medication- three more days!

Doctors should not just prescribe this med to teens without monitoring side effects. Could never wake up in the morning. Felt like I was walking through fog.  Side effects robbed me of two years of my life - I can barely remember them because of this drug.  It's several years later - I have had great success off medication and have been able to manage depression with diet, exercise, and lots of work. It isn't easy but consider if the drug is adding more symptoms than its relieving if it isn't working. Ask to stop.

Three days later he was throwing up ever hour for 10 hours and we went to the emergency room.  He was given two IV and his blood tests came up with abnormal liver function.  He was sent home and retested two days later and his range was 6248 - under 100 being normal.  We saw a pediatric specialist today and his liver is swollen two times the normal size and he had additional blood tests and if the levels have not gone down he will be admitted inpatient today.

My first phychiatrist put me on 1000 mg. Depakote.  He continually monitored my liver enzymes (liver failure in Depakote).  Since then, I have been on Depakote, but recent elevation of liver enzymes caused by MD to stop.  I felt my mood go down the tube and am waiting for blood tests to be taken Monday.  My only real issue that I have incurred with Depakote is a loss of balance, which previously had been perfect; however, being of late on only 250 mg, my balance is unaffected.  Now the company is offering a $50.00 coupon to use since generic divalproex has been introduced.  One week on the generic I became confused and agitated.  I've never been suicidal, but Depakote is the one drug for me!"

I thought that was WAY too much so started out just taking 2 pills a day. Was too tired by 3 pm to keep up with football practices, etc. So I tried just taking one in the morn with my Pristiq. PERFECT!!!! No tiredness, I can't even feel anything from it other than I haven't had those super low days. I have found that I gained just a few pounds due to this crazy craving for ice cream on it..lol But as long as you excersice (which you feel more apt to do when you feel ""normal"")and watch your diet like you should to begin with you will be fine. I read all over the internet before taking this med and there are soooo many scary stories. I thought I would be a big fat bald woman or something..I am fine , actually better than ever.

84$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/21/2010 3:54:54 AM$Reviewer: SFWII, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$After several attempts at finding the right med. for BPII depression, my psych. started me on an aggresive course of Depakote, while watching lvls. and careful controlling of med. prescribing times, with ample warnings to me and careful consideration unto my situation.  Being that I have BPII, my depressive side can get severely out of control also and I have tried so many of the newer, or better, anti-depressants on this,sometimes, ridiculous market of psychiatric medications.  These meds. would only bump me up into a manic-type state and always leave me worse in the long run.  Depakote seemed to be the ONLY  answer we could agree on and I have remained on it for possibly 20 years now.  Only on an extreme occasion, would another anti-deppresive be ordered, only to fail, in the short course of sometimes, days. So, basically, we,ve remained with Depakote thoughout the long-haul of BPII depression.  Sorry to be so run-on, but it's been over two decades working with this medication unto ongoing treatment.   Depakote can help to control symptoms, offer stabillaty where allowed and offer quite few side-effects, in the more, short-term usage.  That is as far as I am concerned.  I would have to say GOOD CHOICE, sometimes the older ones may be the better ones, all things considered.  One more thought, if I may, be SURE to work closely with your' Dr. concerning long-term usuage, such as with my case, as this is imperative for psycho/somatic health.  Teamwork is so important concerning your overall health, choose your' Dr. wisely, He/She will be working best with you when all bases are covered unto prescribing Depakote and any testing of it that should be involved.

I was nervous about taking depakote since I heard it makes you tired, and with taking my other meds, I can't afford to be any more tired!  But my doc insisted I try it, since Prozak just made me suicidal and even crazier.  The one side effect I seem to notice is that, instead of making me tired, it does the opposite - seems to cancel out the sleeping effect of the ativan!!  It's been a rough couple of days, with having to work a full time job and take care of my family on almost no sleep.  Id like to know if anyone else is having the same problem???  I even have tried having a cocktail or 2 in the evening w/ my meds to help me fall asleep, but to no avail....  HELP!!!  The med works w/ my severe mood swings, but I need to sleep too!

On the good side I had no emotions, no fear, no remourse, no cares when people die, it made me laugh at pain, when people got injured, when people fall down stairs,ect.

I've real a lot and everyone's body/brain chemistry is soo different.
But for me Depakote is one of (I believe 1--13) drugs I've taken for my bipolar disorder that has helped.  But it deft. does make you gain weight but not as much as I thought. All the meds over the past 4 yrs have so I'm battling it on my own.
Also -I read it's good for ppl who get headaches? Well ever since begining my frequent headaches have become daily. I'm currently recieveing accupunture for relief. And I've had hair loss which I believe is a result of this drug. But overall I believe it's helped. But I also give myself credit because I go to therapy on a regular basis andreally try to control my moods the best I can. So it's hard to tell what's making the difference. I kinda don't believe in any of the psych meds...that's a whole nother story"

Starting at age 52 I took Depakote for one month before combining it with Paxil. During that first month my mental sexual desire declined greatly, and it became difficult to have an orgasm - lack of sensitivity. Depakote and Paxil have solved by bipolar problem but the sexual side effect has been constant these past 6-7 years. I'm tired of this side effect so I'm going to my psychiatrist soon to discuss other options.

All of the side effects from previous drugs made it harder to deal with than bi-polar itself.  Her doctor then had her start depakote last fall and she did well for a month and half so he doubled it..not sure why. Then she started having the shakes real bad and would be dizzy and stmbled into to things. We were so worried she would break a hip. The doctor pulled her off of it for a couple weeks then started her back to original dose and she's do better. She still tends to feel a little loopy from the meds...but we all agree (her included) that is better than the ups and downs of bi-polar. Treating any depression is so tricky as everyone's body chemistry is different. It takes patience and love and a very good support system for folks suffering.  God bless anyone who has a loved one or is dealing with this themselves.

Side effects so far are a pleasant, carefree mood and I have had the flu this week and it calmed my cough.  I may go bald, but right now I really don't care.

I have been a guinea pig on several medications. Never was in a good mood always having up and very down crazy momments until prescribed to depakote. I believe it has changed my life. Im now happy and on my way to becomming a state trooper.

I sleep more, though (need about 9-10 hours a night), am a bit more flaky and clumsy, and have gained 25 lbs in 6 months.  Don't love the weight gain.  May look into other similar drugs with less weight gain side effects.

Depakote 250mg with Zoloft 50mg was a horrible combination.  I gained 30# in 6 months and had 3 very dark episodes, one of which I was almost hospitilzed for.  I have been of the combination for 1 month and feel much better.  Will be starting Lamictal tomorrow to control the mood swings.
197$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/2/2008 11:07:21 PM$Reviewer: beccasupermom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I take 1000mg of Depakote every day, 500mg in the am and 500 mg in the pm.  It has worked very well for me.  I have to say that it has worked extremely well now that I am also on Geodon in conjunction with it.  I went through several psychiatrists before I found this one who has been wonderful in listening to me and altering my treatment plan to deal with unwanted side effects of other medications.  The main thing that I have not liked about Depakote is the weight gain.  I feel like I'm starving (literally) all the time and have increased appetite because of it.  Overall, though, I would recommend it.  I do believe that if you still have symptoms if on Depakote, ask your doctor because I have NO symptoms at all when coupled with the other mood stabilizer I am on.  I feel happy, healthy, and great!

This medication is working WONDERFULLY for her. No more major mood swings, acting eratic, living on the edge. 
This medication is probably not for everyone.SHe had to try several others and 3 different psychiatrist before we found the right one for her. She has been on it 3 months and could see a immediate difference in her.If you or a loved one suffers from bi-polar disorder do not give up, there is help out there. With medication and the right doctor they can be helped. She also had no side effects from this drug.We found her miracle."

203$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/11/2008 9:42:24 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$3$5$I've been taking depakote for 9 months and it has some what helped my mood swings, but it has really improved my concentration and anxiety problems. Depakote combined with adequate nutrition and exercise is the ultimate treatment for my bipolar dis order.People need to realize that medication alone will not provide them the best results. The worst thing about the depakote for me, is occasionally I have very blury vision. People are complaining about the weight gain due to depakote this has not been true for me.Without the sucess of depakote I could not be persuing a nursing career. I simply could not think.I hope it keeps working for me because other treatments have been a real night mare for me. Abilify and Seroquel about made me lose my mind. I was estatic when depakote worked for me!Though all people are different, I highly recomend it. Good luck and don't give up.

The best part for me is the weight gain. I've always been underweight and now I am able to fill out a pair of jeans WELL. This in turn helps with the low esteem I have had with myself.

211$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/7/2007 12:41:11 AM$Reviewer: Bianca,  Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$I was diagnosed with severe depression and was taking Wellbutrin which eased my depression but gave me severe mood swings, so my doctor prescribed Depakote. I've been on it for one full week and have felt very little physical side effects and my mood has leveled out to normalcy. I am worried about the long term effects but so far so good. The only side effects I have experienced is loss of appetite (very subtle) and a shorter but more efficient sleep pattern. I will only sleep 4-5 hours at a time but feel well rested. That could be due to the combination with the Wellbutrin. Overall, it's been a lifesaver
