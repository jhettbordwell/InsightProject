It also gives them higher cholesterol. The older girl was taken off it for a little while by their doctor, and the had less appetite and lost weight, she's now a healthy weight. When she was on it the first time her cholesterol was high too. Strange thing was the doctor that gave her the medication sent her for the blood work and didn't even mention the results. It changed her mood, but it is not worth jeapordizing her arteries or her getting over weight again. The younger one is irratable, and tired when she's on it.
1$Condition: Other$8/1/2015 10:35:38 AM$Reviewer: kmac, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$3$My son has autism/asperger's syndrome and was having a difficult time staying on task and focusing in school. His psych doctor suggested this med in conjuction with fluoxetine for depression. The drug has worked, it took @4 weeks to become effective but he has gained 35lbs since. I am very concerned about the weight gain and he is taking the lowest dosage 1 mg. From one parent to another, definitely read the side effects and have a back up plan for the weight gain. Otherwise, the drug is very effective. Notice the difference and he is much better. I hope this helps for parents with teenagers.

I never heard any voices. It was just so bad, my disorganized thinking process, that I decided to get help in 2007, when I turned 25. In my late teens, I had tiny precursors but then at about 21, in 2003, I became so very sick. I lost my mind, literally. I could no longer pay attention, and was agitated, and had anxiety so bad. All of this plus terrible concentration problems. In 2007, the psychiatrist prescribed me Paxil, Klonopin, and Risperdal. It was just so amazing how much ""junk"" was cleared out of my head. It was like a really humid day, and then a cold front sweeps through and takes all of the moisture with it, and it becomes cool, dry, with no humidity. That's how I would describe these meds as feeling for about the 1st 3 to 3.5 years. Then I switched to a generic Risperidone, and began having some problems again. My Tourette's came back, in full force. My thoughts were once again scattered. Not as bad, but this was junk compared to Janssen's brand name ""Risperdal."" So I give the Risperidone up all together, and became nuts in the head again with thoughts and garbage flying everywhere in my head. So back on the generic I went. Since I switched to generic, the combo of Risperidone and Clonazepam has caused me much trouble with wetting the bed. I've tried to go off the Risperidone numerous times, but always got back on it due to the craziness in my head. The only complaint I have about Risperidone, is that the Generic isn't as good. Also, it makes me go crazy upon taking it. So I take it right before bedtime, literally. It is a wonderful drug because I have most of my mind and life back. Even though I've gained 150 lbs and have unpleasant side effects. It's great knowing I can have myself back, not all, but most of my old self with the amazing help of Risperidone. 9/10"

Do not even consider taking this med. I had not been sleeping very good so the md gave me this to help with my sleep. I take Citalipram and Atenolol and Lasix, I just found out today that taking these together could cause heart problems and Stroke and possibly Death. I will not take any more of this drug. I have been tired sleepy and confused and cannot remember anything. Also today I found out from my pharmacist that it could help bring on Alzheimers. Why did my Dr. give me this?

Doctor than lowered anti-depressant to lower dosage. Did gain some weight but I don't mind I'm so much happier.

No complaints, no side effects I'm aware of. Again I have been taking 1MG of Risperidone once a day at bedtime for years.

I'm more stable. Great product.

The anti-depressant is Effexor XR. I did try the generic version of Effexor XR released a few months ago.

Within 2 weeks I was back in the toliet with Depression.

And NO I don't have anything against using generics some of the other drugs I take are generic and they work fine.

Something must be different in the generic Effexor XR and the Namebrand. I was very surprized how quickly I slide back into depression.

I have PTSD "

27$Condition: Other$7/7/2011 7:42:44 PM$Reviewer: libby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$1$5$The drug worked great. It had a very calming effect and helped my anxiety and racing thoughts a lot. After about a week of being on it, even at a low dose, I started lactating. This was especially scary because I've never had children and didn't understand it. I guess it had raised my prolactin levels which caused the lactation. It was severe too; it would soak right through my bra and shirt. Very embarrassing.
