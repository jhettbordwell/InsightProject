To improve my quality of life and help with my brain fog my doc prescribed methylphenidate HCL 20 mg. I can still get very tired and sleep with this medication but it works to keep me awake and focused most of the time. I also have developed this horrid metallic taste in my mouth, it's nauseating and deters my appetite due to the taste. I eat and it goes away for a short amt of time... only to return very quickly. I feel nauseated practically all day! It's awful.

He was spiraling out of control.  He had been prescribed several meds including adderal, wellbutrin and others.  Once methylphenidate got in his system, I told his doctor that she had prescribed a wonder drug.  I was the parent of a calmer child for the first time in fourteen years.
