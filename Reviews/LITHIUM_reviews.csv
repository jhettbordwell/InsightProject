The worst is muscle spasms and cramping in my feet and hands. I don't see that as a listed side effect but it is for me. Stopped taking it for awhile because of that. Started again and frequent muscle spasms returned

Constant diarrhea (literally every hour, day and night), nausea, loss of appetite, headaches and general sluggishness. I noticed some difference in my anxiety, but can't deal with the diarrhea. Doctor is putting me on something else. I hope you have better luck.

Lithium allows me to slow down and think clearer and make better thoughts. Law abiding thoughts. I get to see the outcome before I do something.
8$Reason for taking:Bipolar disorder$2/11/2017 9:41:47 PM$Reviewer: rejupiter86, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Consumer) $3$1$3$While lithium has helped with mood swings, especially manic swings, it has had many drawbacks.  I've had hair loss, acne all over my face, dry skin elsewhere, SEVERE lethargy (which I try to counteract with caffeine and Dr. prescribed Ritalin as well--no luck), foggy brain and confusion.  It has sucked out my sex drive entirely.  I have to pee all the time.  Overall, the negatives of lithium for me have outweighed the positives.

12$Reason for taking:$4/27/2016 3:03:50 AM$Reviewer: kmlvr9, 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years$5$5$5$I am bipolar II. My depressions border along the lines of almost psychotic. I take 900 mg. lithium. I can't take lithium carbonate. Causes me toxicity such as dizziness, uncoordination, confusion. So my dr. began giving me Eskalith, which is a time release tablet that releases lithium slowly. This helps to prevent lithium toxicity. Lithium and my antidepressant, Imipramine taken together actually catapults my severe mental depression back to my normal state of mind. I am grateful for these two medications.

When taking the lithium i sweat a lot more i shake. So when I am doing speeches for school my hands shake even if I am not nervous. I am comfortable speaking in front of people but the tremor is noticeable to others. My hands also become cold easily. But being a hormonal teenager could also be affecting it. It can sometimes make you tired and it helps my bipolar episodes.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar I when I was 16, (upon having my 1st manic episode requiring in-patient hosp.) I took lithium carbonate for more than 30 years. I then (slowly) transitioned to lithium orotate, due to concerns of side effects with the carbonate. I am extremely happy with the orotate (no side affects, and VERY effective!) after almost 3 years. Hope this is helpful to someone out there, who might want to research further."
15$Reason for taking:Depression$10/20/2015 10:34:44 PM$Reviewer: dreager,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Consumer) $5$5$5$People, READ! It's Lithium Orotate NOT Carbonate which has to be prescribed by a doctor. This is a natural harmless mineral and the two are no way connected.
16$Reason for taking:Schizophrenia$8/6/2015 2:54:35 PM$Reviewer: Marley, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$5$5$5$"Lithium orotate is not a prescription drug. The prescription lithium is a very high dose of elemental lithium in hopes that some may possibly get to your brain. The over the counter ""lithium orotate"" is great with no noticeable side effects. My son takes it for his catatonic schizophrenia in only two weeks we've seen major improvements, he is on no other meds or antipsychotics. I've taken it for stress, it worked within 15 min.,calming, lifting fogginess, negativities gone, clear thinking and so much more safer than RX lithium, and it is sold in very small doses of elemental lithium, because the orotate acid ensures that the lithium gets into your brain, unlike the RX lithium. please research this for yourself, I think a lot of people could benefit."

18$Reason for taking:Bipolar disorder$1/24/2015 10:17:14 PM$Reviewer: psychiatry is evil, 25-34 Male  (Consumer) $1$1$1$I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder when I was 6 years old and this vile substance was forced down my throat for 11 years. The end results during my formative years, and current health/future health were disastrous. Iv seen it erode away at the minds of family members who took it as well, and who sadly refuse to do without. 
19$Reason for taking:Other$1/23/2015 3:29:34 PM$Reviewer: PlaneJane, 45-54 Male  (Consumer) $3$3$3$"I'm concerned that the reviews shown here are actually referring to Lithium Carbonate, or a prescription form of lithium, rather than Lithium Oratate.

It would be very helpful if reviewers would say whether they are referrring to a prescrption dispensed by a pharamacy or not, and even better if they read the label on the bottom, and reported what, if any, word followed the word ""lithium"" on the label."
20$Reason for taking:Bipolar disorder$1/15/2015 4:59:46 PM$Reviewer: Bbsam , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Consumer) $4$4$4$I was diagnosed with bipolar I at 15 and schizophrenia at 22. I was prescribed lithium first in the mental institution with risperdal(awful) and my normal xanax. After leaving I have continued and upped my dosage to 900mg following topamax, Xanax and concerts. So far it has proven its worth and makes sense why it's the 'go to' med for so many years. It has drastically helped my mood swings and toned down my mania and anxiety. The only side effects that I'm dealing with is loss of appetite/weight loss, extreme thirst, cotton mouth, fatigue and hand tremors, particularly in one finger oddly enough. The side effects and getting my lithium levels checked are the least of my worries to being mentally stable right now.
21$Reason for taking:$12/2/2014 7:58:24 PM$Reviewer: Kelli, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Consumer) $1$1$3$I used this medication for 8 months when I got sober from alcohol. It helped my aggressive outbursts, aggravation,and agitation at first, but agpfter about three months in went in to a complete manic anxiety phase. Where I was constantly tense, the physical pain I was in from R anxiety was too much to handle, and I attempted suicide for the first time in my life. I blame this all on lithium. I was taken off 5 months ago and put on a buspar/fpgabpentin cocktail, along with klonopin, and habpve never felt better. I swear, lithium almost rip united my life. Almost took my life. I wil never take it again.

My life has changed dramatically. My levels of lithium are fine, but my creatine level is higher than it should be. So my doctor took me off 4 days ago. I am a mess! I tried Depakote and it made me blind. I'd rather be on dialysis than lose my mental health. I'm getting a second opinion. Lamictal with Lithium also helped. Im still on Lamictil, I want my Lithium back bc its better with both. Unfortunately, everyone is different chemically. So there is no cocktail that will work right away. I want my Lithium back. Its called a rock and a stone for a reason.

I was resistant to lithium but in spite of weight gain and flattening of emotions and some foggy thinking, it works best as far as helping me keep my job and getting along with people. I do take a medication holiday once every couple of weeks. The other meds i tried either were ineffective or made me want to sleep all the time or caused worse weight gain or caused diabetes. I had very bad problems working on other meds. I've also had two sets of ect in my life. Every time I've gone off lithium I've always returned because the alternatives are worse. It does allow me to have a life. And that's not bad.

More info: The frequency of my 8-year old daughter's brain wave spikes (epilepsy) are treated with Depakote with great success, but there is a residual hyperactivity / attention problem (i.e., being able to work through a simple grade school worksheet, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., crying, independence, focus). This residual hyperactivity could be attributed to her brain wave activity (per online research). With low-dose Lithium Orotate supplement (5 mg Lithium split am and pm,  brand Next to Nature, Inc.), she is able to function, focus, and be around family in a calm and playful manner. The doctor noticed the difference and wanted to know what happened (after the ADHD meds he perscribed weren't compatible with her and after testing highest possible in lack of attention and highest in activity). I understand Lithium Orotate is alternative medicine and could be contraindicated with epilepsy at high doses, plus touted by Jonathan Wright (sp?) who is on many quack lists, but we are thankful to the Lord that this supplement works for us at this time, and that we don't have to resort to substance controlled ADHD medicines that were the worst thing that happened to us since she began having seizures. Taking more than 5 mg/day seemed to be too much, taking more than 2.5 mg/dose also seemed too much. Husband didn't like the effects (too drowsy). I haven't tried it. Must be something in there to calm the brain down.

I believe that this infrequency is due to my negligence of my diet - more specifically, my caffeine intake is generally considerably higher than it should be - both ideally & according to my Dr.which - if I'm understanding correctly - causes the lithium to be flushed through my system, & ultimately renders me unable to reap the full benefit of this prescription. I will be pleased if my prescriber agrees to let me try a different mood stabilizer at my next appt. with him.

It's really bad but if you get really bad side effects like that, see if your salt levels are low and try a salt tablet before you give lithium up completely. My moods feel level when I take it together and it was worth going through that to finally get relief. Hope it helps. (For providers: Lithium can cause hypokalemia and watching salt levels is just as important as checking liver and kidney function)

I have tried EVERY medication thrown at me (don't take Depakote unless you want to gain 50 pounds in 1 month!), because I was so desperate to return to normalcy.  I believe Lithium DOES work, provided that you stringently regulate your diet.  Too much or too little caffeine, salt, water can unbalance you.  Take NO NSAIDs PERIOD, unless you want your kidneys to shut down (happened to me).  I'm still trying to determine how to best treat a headache, or a cold, since I can't take any painkillers or cold medicine, but there is no doubt this drug has eliminated 90-95% of my bipolar mania symptoms, with no return yet to any type of depression.
