I have tried the REAL Roche Brand Valium AND the generic and they both suck; either on high or low doses. I have severe anxiety, PTSD and symptoms of DID. My old psych. thought this was med was the messiah of benzos!  The only thing that works for me is lorazepam/Ativan, Klonopin/clonazepam or Xanax/alprazolam - which I do not like taking, but will they will help my panic.  I had a severe panic attack with dissociation and kept taking diazepam and waited and waited for it to work to kill the attack - it took forever.  If I had any other Benzo, like lorazepam or Klonopin it would have killed the panic attack in 20 minutes.  Thumps down for diazepam for me. However, everyone is different.  It's supposed to be a good med to wean off other benzos.

5$Condition: Chronic Trouble Sleeping$4/4/2018 10:31:57 AM$Reviewer: Recent Widow, 75 or over on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Doctor order 5 mg to be taken 1/2 to 1 at bed time.  Took 1/2 which did nothing so a few hours took the other 1/2.  Did this for a few nights.  Decided to take a whole tablet.  Still couldn't sleep.  Next day I could not function.  Could not breathe.  Ambulance came and EMT got my breathing controlled.  I had trouble answering their questions.  Could not read my signature when I signed their form.  Three days later I am still having problems with dizziness.  Afraid to drive and cannot walk far.  Will see my doctor when she gets back to the office.  Went back to my regular medication for depression.  Was a terrible experience for me, my family and friends.

12$Condition: Muscle Spasm$4/3/2016 8:31:44 PM$Reviewer: Robert, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$3$I tried muscle relaxants like Flexeril before but they had no effect on my muscle spasms. Oddly enough this helps with the knots and the pain associated with them to varying degrees. I take it as needed and sometimes it completely stops the muscle spasms and sometimes it barely does a thing, regardless of the spasm intensity. I wish there was more consistency but this is the only medication that seems to help so I'll take what I can get. Also makes me a bit loopy to varying degrees. Feels good but not exactly useful for trying to get things done plus I sometimes get depressed coming off it.

I suffer from chronic anxiety and no other medications have helped.  I have tried so many.  I started taking it 30 years ago and many Dr's have advised that I stop.  I did stop for 1 year about 8 years ago and it was the worst year that I can remember.   I hate that it is habit forming but it is the only thing I have found that helps me get through the day.  I will probably have to take if for the rest of my life and I am fine with that, if only every new doctor I saw would not try to be the one who can get me off of it!!  They make it for a reason.  I keep my dosage between 10 and 20 mg per day.

I can take up to 10mg. They work very well for me. At first, my salivation production increased when I took this medicine and I would also have sleepiness, but these no longer bother me when I take this medicine. It works very well for me when I take it and I can always rely on diazepam to help me if I get too anxious and cannot control it.

R.& intensive care & all the other parts of the hospital either. At 67 Yrs. old, for the 1st. time in my life I've spent most of it in the hospital They even thought my care giver was trying to poison me, no one understood why I was on oxygen at home & my son or neighbor would find me unconscious & I would ""wake up"" in I.C.U., that is the ""scariest"" scariest place you ever want to come too at in your life. Especially with a tube down your throat. I can sort of understand why they don't want me to have valium, but besides panic attacks, I start breathing so hard thinking I'm going to die right there & ten, I want to take the valium.  Now if I could only quit smoking for good, maybe I could go off oxygen for good. But when they tell you you're going to die, because you have no lung capacity remaining is it, a pill, or a cigarette that will be it?
Every day I wonder, when I'm sitting here alone in the a.m. what am I supposed to do. If someone's gone through this, or has any idea's let me know please. I am scared."

I went to a psychiatrist after a very severe attack and, although none of the SSRIs they wanted me on helped (all horrible side effects) this medication has stayed with me for 6+ years. At one point I was able to taper off to a mere 1mg 3xday, but stress related to PTSD caused me to have to return to 15mg a day. My Dr has me on a irregular schedule where I take different amounts throughout the day which really helps me. I take very little in the morning, but the most in the afternoon. Very rarely, like the holidays, I need to take an extra few mgs for a racing heartbeat. Other than short term memory loss I have had no negative sides. I always keep a notepad and pen with me now. Although I'd like to taper off again someday, if the option is any of the other meds or this med and my notepad, I'll take diazepam the rest of my life as it works so well for me."

I have some bad days and Diazepam is my drug of choice as it seems to level me out and even 5mg puts me in a much better mood. 

My other half tells me to take them some days. I am glad when someone else knows I am in trouble as I may not know it as I am sure others may not know either. But what a relief to me and anyone around me Diazpam is.

 I wish I had taken this and never tried any antidepressants, which I no longer take. This little pills just lightens up those bad days. 

Best drug I have tried to help me. I pray no side effects and I DO NOT use it daily because I do not want an addiction and I want that 5mg pill to work when I need it to.  It only stays in the liver 2 days so that helps as the liver has been effected by other pills in the past. Happy this one has not turned me yellow! I am hoping to no longer need them some day. But for now, I am happy they help.

Highly suggested for anyone like be who has been thru a lifetime of hurt and surgeries and needs a little help.

 I do not drive under any medication, even diazapam. You never know what a drug will do to your mind and if I hurt anyone with my car, I would never forgive myself if I were taking any drug that alters moods or mind or not for that matter. 
You can always take your pill when you get to work and it has its 8 or so hours to work. No sense taking it before work, not when you are driving.

It is a drug, but a good one as far as I am concerned. 
May God Bless..."

I carry my Diazepam with me where ever I go, just incase because this condition can occur whenever it wants. Scary, but managable. I DO recommend for anyone with this awful condition. J

73$Condition: Anxious$3/5/2012 6:04:12 PM$Reviewer: BarneyFife, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Years ago I was prescribed 5mg 3 times per day for acute anxiety and depression related to 'adjustment to adult life'.  I took Valium for about 3 months, then weened myself off.  It was as if a switch had been thrown, turning off my panic and turning on simple normalcy.  I credit Valium for saving my life.  In recent years I have used it during episodes of acute lower back spasm, and once again it has come to the rescue.  I use it only for the purpose intended and for the minimum length of time required for resolution of the problem.  Haven't noticed any negative side effects other than a mild sedation which is a good thing during a panic attack.  In my experience, this is one of those rare chemicals I can call a 'wonder drug', but it must be used appropriately, following the recommendations of a doctor or WebMD or the PDR.  Don't take it lightly.

I've been on it for just under 10 yrs. 10mgx4 daily. It's been used mostly to help with sleep and muscle spasms along with other musclerelaxors. I've also needed it for anxiety once in awhile. For the most part I would say it's by far the best of the benzodiazepines. I'm lucky in a way that if I decide to take a holiday away from my prescriptions, I don't have any withdrawal symptoms. I have a strange tolerance to most pills, I feel that also has to do with my ADHD. It's longer acting than most benzos, but you need to be aware that it has a pretty long half life which if you're not familiar with the term, it stays in your system for about2-3 days, which is why it can be addicting cause the longer you take it, the longer it's half life is, which just stays in your system and builds a tolerance. That's the downside of the med, but it's been around for years, and I've been on many different types of benzos, and I always go back to the diazepam. I hope this may educate some a bit more than they were.

I had been given anti-depressants in the past and they made me not care about anything, and my life went down hill. When I was on and As I was trying to get off the a-d's I became depressed, which I was not depressed to begin with. Everyone is different, but Diazepam has helped me tremendously.

I have been using this for 15 months to treat acute vertigo associated with Ménière's Disease.  It has been very useful in treating symptoms of the strong vertigo attacks that I experience 1 to 5 times per month. When I have a severe case of vertigo I use 10 to 30 mg per day for 1-3 days until the symptoms subside.  Sometimes I use 5 to 10 mg to help with a mild vertigo attack with a short duration (4-6 hours). This drug has helped me manage my symptoms and has 'given me my life back' compared to the time I spent prior to being prescribed diazepam.  It doesn't totally eliminate the veritigo but it does reduce it and helps me to endure the attacks of dizziness.

Side Effects: I sometimes feel drowsy or not as mentally sharp as I'd like to be. My experience with this drug is that it often causes mild constipation. Recommend eating lots of fruits and vegetables when taking."

166$Condition: Other$11/14/2009 10:35:34 AM$Reviewer: mitchb, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$5$I've been on 10 mg per day for 40 years. Being on a low dosage for years I thought withdrawal would be relatively easy as I only take one pill a day. Last week I tried going without and I went completely out of my head after 4 days without. I gave in and took one and when I told my Dr about it she was understanding but told me I will probably be better just to continue my once a day pill forever as no one  should go through benzodiazepine withdrawal. I must agree. The point is that if you use this medication for too long you may develope an addiction which may appear to be next to impossible to break. It can be done but must be done painfully slow and tapered off until one takes a very low dose every second day etc. If using this medication be prepared to possibly be on it for  a while. If your using this medication on a short term basis(2 weeks) then you will be fine. It is when using this med for a month or more that the addiction is hard and can be dangerous. All that said if using this mediocation on a longer term then you will be OK as long as you don't overuse or underuse. Also remember that if your Dr puts you on this med that he or she knows the consequences and deems the use more important than the possible side effects including possible true addiction. After my attempt to quit last week I now have accepted the fact I will probably be taking my one pill a day forever. If I do reattempt withdrawal from diazepam I would get to the point where I would cut it down to a mg once evey two days and then maybe I might stand a chance. An addiction specialist explained to me that since I only take one pill a day and have been doing so for almost 40 years that I should just continue to take it as long as I do not increase my dose without approval. On the positive side this benzo may be good because of it's long half life in the body. It's benzos like Xanax one may best be avoiding as they can induce withdrawal much faster having a short half life in the body.Goodluck

I am downing my dosage to get off the Methadone.  Valium 10 mg. helps me with the muslce restlessness, the inability to sleep, the anhedonia from lack of dopamine production, the dysphoria, from same lack of natural opiate production, and it generally calms the anxiety that goes with the horrible effects of coming off of precription narcotic analgesic.  I would not advise people to use Valium long term, or the withdrawal is very dangerous.  The only 2 meds that most insurance will pay for inpatient detox from are alcohol and benzodiazepines.  The seizures with both are very serious, potentially fatal with the right circumstances.  Used correctly, however, Valium makes the withdrawal from Morphine/Methadone/Codiene/Oxy or hydrocodone tolerable - but incomplete alone.  They treat the symptoms, but not the condition, so to speak.  Also, Valium is helpful for panic attacks, but not so much after an attack is mid-episode.  Good preventative for panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder.  If you TRULY are suffering with anxiety, and you REALLY want to get better, you need to mix the Valium with counseling.  Look for a counselor who does (Brief) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, aka C.B.T.  They use techniques like Systematic Desensitization if you can identify some situations that cause your attacks, but most ppl cannot.  So they teach you Relaxation Techniques, to sort of put yourself into a self-hynotic state of calmness.  It is basically a good diversion while the episode passes on its on.  Well, I hope this helps someone out.  I studied pharmacology as a requirement for my undergrad degree, and I am in grad school now, working on a degree in MPH (Public Health), in an area called Epidemiology, so I am not completely ""full of it.""  I also have some obvious personal experience with addiction, stemming from military service in the sandbox.  DocXYZM.  "

And the 5mg tablets even if they where the cut out v's wouldnt help, cause the 5mg never helped me. Even it was the cut out v's. But the 10mg cut out v's always work for me.

217$Condition: Chronic Trouble Sleeping$9/27/2008 11:59:26 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I was prescribed this in place of meds specifically for sleep because I lost my insurance and had to pay cash. This is less than $10 for 30 days compared to well over $100.
I've found these work just as well if not even a little better in some ways. I do fall asleep quickly enough. I stay asleep all night.
My only complaints are (1) I do not feel as rested as I did when on the meds specifically designed to aid sleep and (2) I can have a little trouble some mornings with a feeling of grogginess. But I've experienced the groggy issue on other meds too.
If you have trouble falling asleep - staying asleep or - like me - are often awakened throughout the night by something out of your control - pain wakes me up - and if you don't have insurance this is a great option. I do suggest trying it on a night when you don't have to drive the next morning so as to see if it causes a problem in the morning.
Good luck and God bless."
218$Condition: Anxious$9/27/2008 11:47:49 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I've used this for minor anxiety off and on for about a decade. It keeps me from slipping into full-blown panic attacks and allows a general feeling of control back to my life.
I hate to say it like this, but after taking this it feels - to me - like I felt back in the days when I drank like I'd had one or two beers. I am calm but not loopy. I feel good but not in an artificial way. I'm still alert enough to function - on one 5mg.
I've used Xanax before and either one works fine. If you start to feel one is not working as well as before you may want to discuss alternating between the two with your doctor to keep your body from becoming too used to either one.
I only gave 4 stars for satisfaction because my only issue with the medication is that it can make me sleepy if I'm already predisposed to feeling tired, e.g. late at night, hard day at work, etc.."
219$Condition: Muscle Spasm$9/27/2008 11:34:57 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$"I am currently being treated for lymphedema in the lower legs (both). The treatment started causing what felt like every muscle from below the knee down to start cramping. The top of my feet, the calf, the shin all started tightening relentlessly.  It was not like a simple ""charley horse.""  It was many times more painful and, it would not work itself out by standing or walking. I was nearly brought to tears because both legs were locking up and there was nothing I could do.
I now take one 10mg before bed each night and this seems to keep everything relaxed.
I also recommend drinking lots of water, increasing your potassium intake and doing light stretching. You may even want to look into cutting-down on your dairy because this can cause muscle spasms for some people.
Another ""trick"" I've tried is drinking pickle juice. I can not say for sure it works in and of itself because I've used it in conjunction with the other tips mentioned here. But on the rare occasion that the cramps feel like they might come back I drink a small glass just to have the added benefit. Even if it's only psychological that's a plus because stress can be a catalyst to some degree.
Good luck to all of you and may God bless."

226$Condition: Anxious$9/6/2008 8:48:26 PM$Reviewer: Lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$" I LOVE this drug.  I have been using it sparingly and only ""as needed"" for almost 20 years.  It is just as effective today as it was back then, and at the same dosage.  If I feel very anxious I take 2.5mg and I am calmer within a very short time.  If I need a good night's sleep and feel anxious, I take 2.5mg to 5mg and sleep happily for a good 6 hours. ( I need 8 hours, but this med lasts for 6 hours ).  I am 5'8 and weigh 128lbs. yet those dosages work great for me.  The greatest benefit I found was that having taken this med off & on and sparingly ""as needed"", I was able to mimick (without the drug) the CALM feeling that it gave me.  The mind is a powerful thing! It takes years of working on, but I couldn't have done it alone (without this drug).  I am at relative peace now because I am older and wiser AND because I have a great store of this drug incase I need it.  If you suffer severe Panic Attacks or severe Anxiety that you can't calm down by yourself, I highly recommend careful use of this drug. Others sware by Xanax... never tried that one.     Hang in there."

242$Condition: Other$3/4/2008 1:14:48 PM$Reviewer: Tony S, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$"I was prescribed diazepam for treatment of chronic dizziness and vertigo.  After over 2 years of searching for an answer, a very low dose (1 mg, 3 times per day) has relieved my dizziness without sedating me. In fact, I actually have MORE energy than less on this drug at this dosage level. This is an ""off-label"" use of this drug according to the neurologist that prescribed it.  It has allowed me to go back to a normal or near-normal life.  Seems odd that a medication that can make you ""dizzy"" can, in very low doses, relieve vertigo and unsteadiness.  My non-medical theory is that it calms down what I would describe as an electrical storm in my brain.  Moving scenes on TV or bright lights in a store would trigger my vertigo - no longer.

I previously tried meclizine, but even at low doses it just knocked me out and all I did was sleep the day away.

I cut 2 mg tabs in half to create my 1 mg doses.  The plan is to cut back to 2 mg/day after a couple of months and see how it goes."
