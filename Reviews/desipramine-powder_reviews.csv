1$Condition: Other$4/30/2012 3:35:37 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$1$my gastro doctor perscribed this for stomach pain. it worked like a charm on the pain, but made me jittery and my entire body shakes uncontrollably while on it, and it caused me to sweat a lot. it also made me have panic attacks. i'd rather have the pain than deal with the shaking and panic attacks.
