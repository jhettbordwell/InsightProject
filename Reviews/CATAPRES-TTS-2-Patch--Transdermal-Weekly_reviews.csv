2$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$11/10/2009 2:34:21 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$I have had a terrible reaction to this medicine. Catapres-TTS-2 caused severe depression, where I experienced hatred and temper which I have never had in my life.
3$Condition: High Blood Pressure$9/22/2009 12:25:37 PM$Reviewer: HoneyDoforYou Handyman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$3$"Started with Catapres TTS2 patches which sometimes came off but the overlay would eliminate problems and the medication delivery was consistent either way.  Dropped BP an additional 20-30 points!
Switched to generic Clonidine patch which never stayed on even with overlay.  Would recommend sticking with Catapres TTS unless you are sedintary and don't sweat or move much. I also take Minoxidil (10mg) x2, Metoprolol Succ ER (100mg), Ramipril (10mg), Hydrochlorothiazide (25mg), Potassium CL ER (20MEQ) x2, Nexium (40mg) and have no obvious side effects from anything other than lower blood pressure, from 220/110 to 130/80."
4$Condition: High Blood Pressure$9/14/2009 1:02:50 PM$Reviewer: bernee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Very Satisfied, but do not get the generic brand as the patch did not stick to my skin; even with the overlay patch.  Had to replace after 1 day and then the next one still did not stick.  Stick with name brand-no generic.
5$Condition: High Blood Pressure$8/2/2009 10:54:10 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$If I put the patch on and take my oral meds. at the same time, I get a very severe case of orthostatic hypotension.  Then the last 2 days of the patch my BP  begins to rise to higher levels than the first few days of the use of the patch.
6$Condition: High Blood Pressure$5/9/2009 1:05:22 PM$Reviewer: Irisheyes, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$Lowered my blood pressure, however has made me very dizzy at times
7$Condition: High Blood Pressure$4/26/2009 2:55:36 PM$Reviewer: LADYHW, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$"Yes the medication works, but when the made the patch bigger it increased my itching 200%. Can't you guys find a glue that doesn't itch so bad and causes me scars from scratching. The only reason I tolerate this side effect is because it also helps with my smoking cessation and HOT FLASHES. 
As you can see I am taking it a for all three of the main reasons stated in the condition drop down menu."

13$Condition: High Blood Pressure$5/7/2008 3:12:11 PM$Reviewer: judy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This worked great, and I had been on many meds before that did nothing. The only thing is that I have so many allergies that after 4 weeks I had blisters under the patch and had to switch to Clonidine which is the same thing, only pill form and I have to take it more times a day. I would definetly still be on the patch if I could.
14$Condition: High Blood Pressure$2/19/2008 11:13:18 AM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$5$Right now I feel really loopy, but after a year of trying to get my BP down and 2 TIA's this is doing the job.
