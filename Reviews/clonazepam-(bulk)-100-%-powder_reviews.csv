Heart conditions usually start at the top of the heart, whereas in my case, my heart valve conditions started a the bottom of my heart where the stomach and esophagus meet extremely to that lower heart valve. There are indeed very lose to each other, causing pain, and swallowing became very difficult. I burped continually with some chest & back shoulder pain.

The Clonazepam, of which I take only a small dose TID, not only helps with the panic attacks/anxiety I have, but also has this pleasant side effect of making me very active, quite the opposite of my ""normal"" self who is full of depression and can barely rise out of bed. It also seems to help with the chronic joint pain I have. I  also take Celexa, which I can't tell if it works really, but I've been doing better, no major ""episodes"" in the last 3 + years I've been on these 3 drugs for my bipolarism. Nope, no Lithium, it made me very sick!  And I've tried many other anti-depressants and they have had very upsetting side effects. So, there you have it! I'm just FULLA psych-meds! They work, but take away a lot of the colors in life, those ups and downs that we really value. I feel a lot like a zombie in limbo now, honestly. But it is worth it, if it keeps my 3 kids seeing that their mommy is in control of her mind now! It took a long time to gain their trust back, but we're there, thanks to the meds and the diagnosis finally! Thanks for reading my experience."
