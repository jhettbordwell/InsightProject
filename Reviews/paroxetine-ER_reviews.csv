If I missed a day or two, I would get so dizzy that I could barely function. I quit the medicine cold turkey once and got terrible withdrawal, which included extreme dizziness, fever-like symptoms, and extreme depressions.

I switched to fluoxetine (Prozac), which has a significantly longer life in your body, and the dizziness is almost negligible.

If you are having dizziness issues with paroxetine, switching to another medication will help.

I am now currently suffering from symptoms related to having to stop this drug, and it is interfering drastically with my life!  Any advice?

While I was on it, I felt great. When I decided to quit, my doctor told me to wean myself off over a 2 week period. I actually took more (1 month) and thought I was doing fine. The torture started 2 weeks after being completely off. Dizzy spells, nausea, extremely dry skin mostly on the head, vivid dreams, little sleep because of pain in my legs etc... the dizziness and nausea went on for about month, the pain in the legs is still there at night, just not as severe and of course the depression set back in. That was 4 years ago. Now I'm afraid to try anything else. Certainly not going back on Paxil.

16$Condition: Depression$5/29/2013 6:29:43 PM$Reviewer: anonymous, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$this stuff is horrible. I was prescribed this for depression and anxiety. I totally shut down mentally on this, living without any emotional feeling at all. After about 6 weeks developed migraines with loss of vision. This was terrifying. Eye doctor said the pill was causing it but MD said it wasn't the pill and prescribed a medication for the migraines. Weaned myself off of this, the headaches went away and once again I feel like living. I had some withdrawal symptoms for a few days but it was worth it to get off this and get rid of the side effects. I will never let anyone talk me into taking any type of drug like this again.

Several times I have ceased taking the medication (inadvisedly) and suicidal depression has returned within a month.  I now accept that I need to remain medicated.  For anyone who wishes to stop taking this medication - don't stop suddenly! Reduce your dose gradually over a period of weeks to avoid withdrawal symptoms. And advise your doctor.

At first, it worked great for my depression, but almost destoyed my sex life.  My drive is fine, but I have an extremely hard time to ejaculate. I really need a higher dose because I am borderline with the depression thing now, but I really dont dare with the side effect.  Also, I have gained an average of 8-10 pounds per year and no matterwhat I do, I cant take any off.  I think I need a different med.

I have (or had) depression, bipolar, manic, anxiety and heart palpitions. I've been off Tegretal XR (bipo) for two weeks and doing well.
From the medication (maybe Paroxetine oral 30 mg.) I might be getting light headed. tingling, and ""zaps to my head. Anyone having trouble getting off of Paroxetine? what are you experiencing? Thanks for the input."

For my anxiety, it's been awesome.  I stopped being afraid of stupid things like dogs and matches (which isn't what I was prescribed it for though).  I started being able to go back to school (I became scared of leaving my house before I went on this).  So for my anxiety, it's been great.  This has done very little for my depression though.  Never has, no matter what dosage I was on (started at 20, went to 30, now at 40mg).  It's also starting to seem not to work very well anymore.  After 9 years, it may be time to try something new.  No side effects except when I forget a dose (dizziness, weird shock feelings in my head).

I gained alot of weight and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get it off. I was switched to Pristiq, (I took took Effor in the past), and have relief from depression and lost weight, but it's not worth the headache, fatigue and stiff neck I'm having now. I plan to go back to old faithful (paroxetine) it works, it's affordable...So I may be gubby, but happier, what would you choose.

42$Condition: Depression$11/30/2010 12:27:14 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$I'm on the extended release tablets to help reduce nausea I was feeling from the Celexa I was initially prescribed. I would say it has worked somewhat for me. I feel a little better but have been experiencing some new symptoms recently. I've been on this medication about 2 months now and I have noticed a decreased appetite and have lost 15 pounds since being on this. (which I'm totally fine with because that's the extra baby weight I couldn't lose from having my son two years ago!) So the weight loss I'm fine with, however I'm noticing that my hands, arms, and legs are really shaking all the time now. Has anyone else had a problem with this? My leg will literally shake while I hold down the brake pedal in my car and sometimes it's to the point where I can't text on my phone my hands and fingers are shaking so much. I'm going to be scheduling an appointment to follow up my doctor to see if this is a result of the medication or maybe something else. I've had increased pain in my joints recently and severe fatigue. These symptoms have all been within the last 2 weeks and seem to be getting worse. I also have had terrible stomach pain to where I literally can not sit it's so bad. So I don't know if something else is going on or if it's from this medication. These are just all things I've noticed that are new since being on this. If anyone has had the problems with joint pain and the shaking, please feel free to email me and let me know what you know about it. I've tried looking it up but am not finding much help. Thank you! I can be emailed at [email protected]    In terms of my depression though, this has seemed to improve somewhat although not totally. Some days are better then others.

49$Condition: Depression$6/24/2010 6:58:38 PM$Reviewer: Grumpy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I started out several years ago taking Effexor XR for depression.  It worked but didn't seem to work enough, so I switched to Wellbutrin.  That didn't do much for me, so I switched to Paroxetine 10 mg.  That worked just a bit, but I didn't feel back to myself yet, so the doctor upped it to 20 mg then 40 mg is what I'm on now.  Although, I do feel more able to deal with reality and not fly off the handle like I used to, I also feel like I'm gaining too much weight by being on it.  I still don't feel like I have enough energy like I used to.  But the weight situation is bothering me so I've started taking myself off of the meds to see if the weight comes off and if I can feel good about things again.  It's a trial and error thing but I know I'll have to come off it slowly and not all at once.  Thats why some people feel dizzy, fuzzy headed and such, because you're coming off too fast.

I have been taking this medication for exactly one week, and I feel a world of difference.  It doesn't make your problems go away, but it does make everything easier to deal with.  It's not so hard to wake up in the mornings, I'm not so tired all the time, and the world looks a little brighter to me.  I had some nausea the first couple days, but other than that I have experienced no serious side effects.  The only part I am not looking forward to is coming off this medication, because from what I've read, the withdrawal symptoms are severe.

52$Condition: Depression$4/16/2010 12:50:07 PM$Reviewer: chad, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"I started on 40 mg about 2.5 years ago following a suicide attempt.  For the next 9 months, I took the daily dosage, but continued to abuse alcohol.  I have been alcohol free for the past 1.5 years, and eventually decreased my dosage to 20 mg daily, about 6 months ago.  Once I quit drinking, the medication was allowed to do great things for my outlook on life.  5 days ago, when my current prescription ran out, I discontinued the 20 mg daily, in an attempt to get off the drug.  I am now in the middle of the ""withdrawals"" of dizzyness, buzzing noise in my head, and headaches.

The only effect this drug had on me was it made me very very sleepy. It did not help with depression or my mood/anger. I talked to my Dr and decided to go off medication completely (as I seemed to be better before I went on the meds) and ever since then (it has been about 2 months trying to get off it)I am living in hell. I am now down to 10mg every 4 days, and about day 3 my heart begins to flutter and beat repidly, I get very very dizzy every time I move at all, and my lips go numb and tingly (like foot falling asleep). I would not ever consider another drug of this kind due to the horrible time I am having with this. I just hope I can get off it and feel normal again...the sooner the better.

Increased activity levels, better mood stabilization.- Have not needed any Colonazepam for the last two months. Reduced Par. Hcl to 20mg. now 10mg. over the last three months. My experience- Do not try eliminating the par.hcl to quickly. Side effects have been some occassional dizziness,blood pressure seems a bit higher,weight gain small- may be just a result of feeling better(more dinners out etc.)Have much more energy,enthusiasm etc. This after all those side effects associated with depression. I have gone from curled up on a ball on the couch to enjoying each day. It will happen!!! Give it time.

My doctor raised my dose from 20mg to 40mg and WOW what a mistake that was. To make a long story short several days after taking the 40 mg I tried to commit sucide. In my opinion either the 40mg is being produced by a different company than the 20mg or there is something terribly wrong with with the medicine..I am 70 years old and will not continue with the 40mg. In my opinion this med will start killing people."

My moods seem to be a little better I think lol I would like to ask everyone that is doing reviews or reading this.....Has weight gain been a problem for you on this medication? I quit smoking about 3 months ago (about the time I started taking this medication) so I am not sure which is causing the weight problems I am having. I hate to give up on this and go to a different drug because of the weight issue but on the flip side I know being overweight is just about as unhealthy as being depressed all the time. Please if anyone has any cooments or suggestions e~mail me. I would love to hear other peoples thoughts on the weight issue. Thank you in advance!

Paroxetine for about 3mos. in 2007 for very severe depression, with thoughts of suicide. It was an added med.,  with Wellbutrin I was already taking. I was desperate for relief from my illness. I suggested it to my PCP, cause I had a friend that had success with Paxil for her anxiety & stress. Zoloft & Lexipro had not worked for me as added meds. We were searching. With me, Paroxetine also was a colossal failure! No relief from symptoms, and it gave me an awful ""chemically induced"" headache with ea. dose that I just couldn't get past. I don't recall if I gained weight or not. The headaches mostly caused me to quit taking it. I've since been diagnosed with Bi-Polar II depression by a QUALIFIED mental health professional , which may explain why that class of med's did not work for me. I'm posting at length because my experience was so bad, maybe I can help others."

It took away my most of my interest in sex, but it made life so much easier to deal with.  I was sleepy, so I took the pills at night.  That helped.  I also gained weight that was difficult to get off once I stopped taking Paxil.
I'm going back on it this week--I've still got St. John's Wort in my system--and am hoping I can deal with the weight gain issue.  This time I've gone through too much sadness over the past 12-14 months.  It started with my uncle dying, followed by my mother, friends, aunts, and so many others.  Some days I just want to curl up and disapear.  I'm hoping Paxil will once again help.  I'll let you know what happens this time around."

Takes away obsessive thoughts, clears the webs of negative thought. I have taken it 3x for a year each time. Each time I gained 20 pounds. One time I exercised daily for 60 min and didn't lose weight. Takes away libido completly. I take this in an emergency (very stressed, panicky, paranoid,insomnia and depressed). I'm familiar w/ zaps.....careful when getting on and off...you need a week to chill out w/ the withdrawel. I'm not afraid of the crazy withdrawel symptoms so I usually get off quickly and ride the craziness....not for the faint of heart.
