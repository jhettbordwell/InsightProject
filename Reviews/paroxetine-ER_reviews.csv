0$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/16/2019 6:36:18 PM$Reviewer: C, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Very satisfied with Paroxetine. I take 20 mg daily since June 2018. Few side effects during the first couple of weeks, then after 6 weeks, the medication fully kicked in and it was a life-changer. No more panic attacks and anxiety, and most importantly no more endless overthinking. 
1$"Condition: ""Change of Life"" Signs"$3/10/2019 9:27:32 PM$Reviewer: BettyBoop, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Hourly hot flashes have dwindled to half a dozen a day. A bit sleepy in the evening earlier than usual, but a welcome time to relax. Dry mouth, so drinking more water! Noticeable weight loss due to lack of appetite...also a plus. More energy in the morning, so more productive. Only taking 10 mg for the past 3 months.

3$Condition: Other$1/6/2019 12:33:05 PM$Reviewer: deb93004, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$"Instead of a low-dose Ativan previously prescribed by my oncologist, something which I had ZERO side-effects from, my GP decided I shouldn't be taking it any more. After a week of taking 10mg of Paroxetin at bedtime, I told him I was having mild side-effects which were similar to the severe reaction I had to Prozac, so he recommended the ""extended release"" of Paroxetin 12.5mg instead. Overall, I've been taking this product less than a month now, and I've determined it to be the reason I am constantly in a FOGGY state of mind. I feel like I could stay in bed all day, my head feels pressurized, AND, my eyes & face are puffy.  It's Sunday so doc and pharmacy aren't open, but, I'm going to take my chances (hope not to have 'withdrawl' symptoms too)...  I'm taking myself off of this, starting today!"

8$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/26/2017 4:18:39 AM$Reviewer: NuturingNature, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$I noticed a positive effect the first week I started the treatment (at age 30). The relief was almost overwhelming. I hadn't felt like that since I was a kid. With continued treatment, I lost some of my inhibitions, but I was extremely inhibited, so that's mostly good. One of the first things I noticed was that I wasn't so worried about deadlines anymore, which is kind of not a good thing, but I'm still employed. It became MUCH easier to make decisions, too, without so much cross-talk in my head. I did get tired taking it, so switched to taking it at night. Also, due to lower inhibitions, got addicted to nicotine gum because it energized me. That is something I NEVER would have done before paxil. I'm on a steady dose 14mg nictotine patch now, and it actually works pretty well for me in combination with paxil. Kind of a bummer to be so dependent on two drugs. But I'm actually still living and enjoying it! So, I can't complain. I've been on it 14 years now, never had to increase the dose. A milder form of my old problems can still recur under stress, but it's always temporary. I'm worried about long term effects. If I drink more than 2 drinks, and then take a paxil (I take it at night), I feel like I might die if I fall asleep, and I feel odd the next morning in a way that's different than a normal hangover. I guess that's a good way to keep my consumption in check! Though if I must drink more (social occasion), I'll skip the paxil for a night, and that helps. It's all worth it though for me. I'm still shy, but at least I don't clam up and freeze in groups of people anymore. I can actually talk to more than one person at a time even. And I don't jelly over in a grief I can't define properly. And a lot of other things. All in all, I give this drug a thumbs up. I am a bit peeved that it's advertised as being non-addictive, though.

10$Condition: Depression$1/23/2017 1:24:56 AM$Reviewer: ajaa, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$2$2$"This was effective for mild-medium depression (20 mg), but the dizziness side effect was nasty. If I missed a day or two, I would get so dizzy that I could barely function. I quit the medicine cold turkey once and got terrible withdrawal, which included extreme dizziness, fever-like symptoms, and extreme depressions.

I switched to fluoxetine (Prozac), which has a significantly longer life in your body, and the dizziness is almost negligible.

If you are having dizziness issues with paroxetine, switching to another medication will help.

I never thought I would take an antidepressant as I've been a happy camper my whole life. Menopause hit and changed my brain; I was stressed out, looping thinking, couldn't sleep and not myself.  I am now back to ME. I resisted medication for a long time, but paroxetine helped immensely.  I've gained a little weight, but it's worth it to have my old self back.

I've been on it a little over 6 months.  Works great for me. However I use it only for Anxiety and I think of it as a 'certain limit' of anxiety and my anxiety has been so bad the past month that it breached this wall or limit.  so I may need something additional to this.

People noticed a change in me and I noticed a change in myself.  After a while, I feel like my body got used to the medication and I don't really feel like it did anything.  The one side effect that I noticed was increased sweating.  It got to the point where I couldn't even go outside without dripping sweat like someone had poured water on my head.  I couldn't go to restaurants without sweating like crazy and having to fan myself the entire meal.  I am getting off of it slowly by gradually decreasing the dosage.  I have not had any of the side effects of getting off of the drug that I have read on some of the other reviews.  I am on a large dose (40 mg) so I came up with a schedule to slowly decrease the dose over the next month.  I have already noticed that I do not sweat nearly as much now as when I took the entire dose as prescribed.  Because of the sweating, I will not be taking this medication again.

While I was on it, I felt great. When I decided to quit, my doctor told me to wean myself off over a 2 week period. I actually took more (1 month) and thought I was doing fine. The torture started 2 weeks after being completely off. Dizzy spells, nausea, extremely dry skin mostly on the head, vivid dreams, little sleep because of pain in my legs etc... the dizziness and nausea went on for about month, the pain in the legs is still there at night, just not as severe and of course the depression set back in. That was 4 years ago. Now I'm afraid to try anything else. Certainly not going back on Paxil.

The dosage was 20mG.  It was the second drug tried, the first being Zoloft which I had a severe negative reaction to.  This drug worked well and after an incident that really impacted my anxiety my dose was increased to 40 mG for a period of time.  Eventually I was able to go back to 20mG for a long time.  I am now in a period where I am trying to go off of this drug.  At first, I dropped from 20 mG to 10 mG.  This may have been too big of a jump.  I experienced extreme dizziness that lasted for about 10 days.  My next decrease I went from 10 mG to 5 mG.  I still had a lot of dizziness and it still lasted about 10 days.  I am currently at 5 mG and getting ready to do my next decrease.  I am unsure if I will try to go to every other day of 5 mG or just try to stop cold turkey.  If you are decreasing dosage I would recommend finding a stretch of time where you don't have much going on due to these side effects.  From what I have looked up, mine are actually milder than many other people have reported.  I decided to go off of this drug because I was experiencing extreme fatigue and have gained a lot of weight and wanted to see if it was impacting these.  Since decreasing dosage I have noticed much more energy.  I would still recommend it because it helped me through a period of extreme anxiety, but it does look like it may have been contributing to my extreme fatigue.  While I am excited to go completely off of this drug I would use it again if my anxiety ever returned to such high levels.

This was terrifying. Eye doctor said the pill was causing it but MD said it wasn't the pill and prescribed a medication for the migraines. Weaned myself off of this, the headaches went away and once again I feel like living.

The second day of no pills I started to get lightheaded and dizzy and it only got worse. It was so bad I was vomiting for a whole day, couldn't keep anything down. After the fifth day off I started to feel somewhat better, I could go to work again. I never post reviews but wanted to with this just to give potentials users a head up. For me it didn't work, it may for you, but expect a good week of misery once you get off them. I am now planning on trying exposure and response prevention (cognitive behavioral therapy) for my OCD, I'm hoping that will help better than Paroxetine HCL.

Not sure I ever want to wean off this medication.  Im sure it works differently for every person. Guess I was lucky my first time around, because it has worked so well for me and have never had to experiment with other brands.

The doctor was quick to prescribe this medication but she only gave me 2 refills. The doctor never mentioned the withdrawals.

My depression and constant headaches went away during my treatment, but i would have never taken this medication had i know the withdrawals symptoms.

I take 10 mg at night, and in the morning I feel hung over until about 2 to 4 pm, then I feel normal for about 4 to 5 hours before I take it again. I do not feel depressed, anxiety, or moody.  I do feel like someone is scrambling my brains. I have been on other bi-polar medicine for 15 years, and about every 5 to 6 years I need to switch because medicine either does not help, or I have become manic. So far I am not happy with this medicine, but will continue to try it for a few weeks to give it a fair try.

For my anxiety, it's been awesome.  I stopped being afraid of stupid things like dogs and matches (which isn't what I was prescribed it for though).  I started being able to go back to school (I became scared of leaving my house before I went on this).  So for my anxiety, it's been great.  This has done very little for my depression though.  Never has, no matter what dosage I was on (started at 20, went to 30, now at 40mg).  It's also starting to seem not to work very well anymore.  After 9 years, it may be time to try something new.  No side effects except when I forget a dose (dizziness, weird shock feelings in my head).

It has worked well for me at 30mg for most of the time.  Positive effects: I got my life back within a few days.  Within two months I was 'me' again.  Side effects: loss in sex drive, inability to be satiated at mealtime (weight gain), over-heating (especially after exercise), occasional stuttering or loss-of-words, problems urinating (when tired), & twitchy muscles (when tired).  Believe it or not, all of this has been a piece of cake compared to the nightmarish anxiety I was living with 24/7 for years.

I'm now on 40mg.  The last two months (out of 12 on the drug) I have been having weird dizzy spells, like I'm being shocked.  I switched to decaf coffee, I talked to the doc, I've experimented with nutrition (high, moderate, vs. low carb intake, etc).  Nothing is working.  These dizzy spells drive me nuts, much more than the other symptoms.  I'm going to ask the doc to begin taking me off the drug, though she wants to keep me on for another 6 months.  The dizziness, although not painful or nauseating, is simply jarring.  Also, my driving-anxiety has resurfaced (only when others are driving), but no other anxiety symptoms (like cyclic thinking or social phobia, etc) have resurged.  It's been a nice year."

I would say it has worked somewhat for me. I feel a little better but have been experiencing some new symptoms recently. I've been on this medication about 2 months now and I have noticed a decreased appetite and have lost 15 pounds since being on this. (which I'm totally fine with because that's the extra baby weight I couldn't lose from having my son two years ago!) So the weight loss I'm fine with, however I'm noticing that my hands, arms, and legs are really shaking all the time now. Has anyone else had a problem with this? My leg will literally shake while I hold down the brake pedal in my car and sometimes it's to the point where I can't text on my phone my hands and fingers are shaking so much. I'm going to be scheduling an appointment to follow up my doctor to see if this is a result of the medication or maybe something else. I've had increased pain in my joints recently and severe fatigue. These symptoms have all been within the last 2 weeks and seem to be getting worse. I also have had terrible stomach pain to where I literally can not sit it's so bad. So I don't know if something else is going on or if it's from this medication. These are just all things I've noticed that are new since being on this. If anyone has had the problems with joint pain and the shaking, please feel free to email me and let me know what you know about it. I've tried looking it up but am not finding much help. Thank you! I can be emailed at [email protected]    In terms of my depression though, this has seemed to improve somewhat although not totally. Some days are better then others.

It helped my social life - I started making friends very soon after - it decreased my inhibitions. It made me sleepy, foggy, forgetful, & I think dumber (lessened the OCD mentality that helped with schoolwork). Sex was good then but I was just starting to experience it - 10 years later it is very low. I've tried to get off Paxil a few times to regain my sex drive and intelligence but life always becomes too stressful for me and Paxil is my crutch. It seems like my social awkwardness and extreme shyness is coming back - maybe the dosage is becoming ineffective.  I don't want to increase the dose so maybe I'll wean myself off of it for a bit and then (maybe) return to it.

The other generic made by ZYDUS caused me horrible, vivid, violent nightmares where I would wake up in a sweat. It also caused severe fatigue and suicidal thoughts.  This brand is dangerous !
I was just told today that Apotex is no longer available. Called my Dr. for advice. I have been taking Paxil 20mg generic for 8 yrs and have had no serious side effects, except, lack of sex drive. It keeps me sane with no anxiety."
130$Condition: Depression$6/24/2010 6:58:38 PM$Reviewer: Grumpy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I started out several years ago taking Effexor XR for depression.  It worked but didn't seem to work enough, so I switched to Wellbutrin.  That didn't do much for me, so I switched to Paroxetine 10 mg.  That worked just a bit, but I didn't feel back to myself yet, so the doctor upped it to 20 mg then 40 mg is what I'm on now.  Although, I do feel more able to deal with reality and not fly off the handle like I used to, I also feel like I'm gaining too much weight by being on it.  I still don't feel like I have enough energy like I used to.  But the weight situation is bothering me so I've started taking myself off of the meds to see if the weight comes off and if I can feel good about things again.  It's a trial and error thing but I know I'll have to come off it slowly and not all at once.  Thats why some people feel dizzy, fuzzy headed and such, because you're coming off too fast.

I have been taking this medication for exactly one week, and I feel a world of difference.  It doesn't make your problems go away, but it does make everything easier to deal with.  It's not so hard to wake up in the mornings, I'm not so tired all the time, and the world looks a little brighter to me.  I had some nausea the first couple days, but other than that I have experienced no serious side effects.  The only part I am not looking forward to is coming off this medication, because from what I've read, the withdrawal symptoms are severe.  
132$Condition: Other$6/3/2010 9:31:47 PM$Reviewer: austin, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$1$"I've taken paxil 10mg and paroxetine 20mg with some positive results, but Paroxetine 40mg should be looked at closely. Any medication with a black box warning is to dangerous for taking daily for more than 4 to 5 days and can be deadly. Hence, ""black box warning."" This is the last step being having the medication pulled. Not only have I experienced going 2 days without, which led to awful withdrawl what I could only imagine going cold turkey with heroin or crack must be like. Took me days to recover, even once I was able to get my script and start back on it. Also I get the ""zaps"" which I've never had prior to the 40mg, along with other side effects. I almost feel trapped in using this drug and with my Dr's help and other therapy I hope to rid of my life. 

Read on what Japan and England have said about the medication and experiences...awful.

Good luck and take care...just my experience"

I talked to my Dr and decided to go off medication completely (as I seemed to be better before I went on the meds) and ever since then (it has been about 2 months trying to get off it)I am living in hell. I am now down to 10mg every 4 days, and about day 3 my heart begins to flutter and beat repidly, I get very very dizzy every time I move at all, and my lips go numb and tingly (like foot falling asleep).

My 1st week of being off paroxetine totally  I experienced intense panic & disorientation ie a feeling I was losing my grip on reality - like a moment on the edge sanity. I hoped this was being caused by a simple lack of SSRI & the new pill increasing the SSRI would diminish it.

I hate to give up on this and go to a different drug because of the weight issue but on the flip side I know being overweight is just about as unhealthy as being depressed all the time. Please if anyone has any cooments or suggestions e~mail me. I would love to hear other peoples thoughts on the weight issue. Thank you in advance!

192$Condition: Other$5/25/2009 8:07:15 PM$Reviewer: Blu, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$1$This writing is a bit premature probably I know.Mostly I am writing about concerns as I begin this unknown (to me)treatment.Depression (suicidal tendencies)& such have plagued me all my life, most of my whole family suffers from such things. I was given this medication 2 days ago. There are 20 possible side effects listed, 12 of which are symptoms I already suffer.With the 1st dose the itchy, bugs crawling on my skin feeling is immediately worse, nausea with pretty strong gagging & dry heaves hurt my back like h**l! I was prescribed this from an ER doctor & not a psychologist or the such.I have serious doubts but my psych-eval isn't for another wk & I feel it is long since time to try and deal with my issues, even if it is by trying bad medicines. I probably shouldn't be taking this, but withdrawals & DTs are nothing new to this veteran addict.Its either something like this or a life of meth & other drugs. Which is worse? We shall see.     
193$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/24/2009 11:25:16 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"I started this medicine to help control anxiety and help with depression.  Was taking prozac which worked well for depression but not so much anxiety.  
   First 2 days were rough.  Headache and slept all day first day. Then tired and yawning nonstop second day. Still get the yawns once in a while. Have fantastically bizarre dreams now and then.  Has helped me get to sleep right away at night. Use to have trouble putting myself to bed.  I did have trouble getting up in the morning but that has passed.
   Also have experienced longer intercourse time to ejaculation with better orgasms.  Went from 1 to 2 minutes to 10 to 15.  Have a decreased libido but I can focus on other things rather than sex.  (My wife likes both these side effects.)
    It has helped with my anxiety greatly almost to a fault.  I've found myself saying some things that are inappropriate for the social settings I'm in.  Overall it has been a blessing though.  I no longer obsess over things that might happen and am able to talk in front of large groups without panic attacks.  I joked with a friend that it was like being the character in the movie Office Space who gets hypnotized into not having a care in the world...I'll be taking down the walls to my cubicle and cleaning fish on my office desk next.
     I do find that I still have a certain level of depression.  I don't think I'll give up on the drug though.  I have yet to start exercising and doing the other things I need to do to help deal with that.  
     So all I can say is that it seems to be working for me.  I hope you find what works for you and don't give up til you do!

I suggested it to my PCP, cause I had a friend that had success with Paxil for her anxiety & stress. Zoloft & Lexipro had not worked for me as added meds. We were searching. With me, Paroxetine also was a colossal failure! No relief from symptoms, and it gave me an awful ""chemically induced"" headache with ea. dose that I just couldn't get past. I don't recall if I gained weight or not. The headaches mostly caused me to quit taking it.

I had to come off that last year due to severe side effects.  
242$Condition: Depression$7/28/2008 11:18:32 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$4$"I took Paxil about 8-10 years ago when I was having some major problems with my family life.  It took away my most of my interest in sex, but it made life so much easier to deal with.  I was sleepy, so I took the pills at night.  That helped.  I also gained weight that was difficult to get off once I stopped taking Paxil.
I'm going back on it this week--I've still got St. John's Wort in my system--and am hoping I can deal with the weight gain issue.  This time I've gone through too much sadness over the past 12-14 months.  It started with my uncle dying, followed by my mother, friends, aunts, and so many others.  Some days I just want to curl up and disapear.  I'm hoping Paxil will once again help.  I'll let you know what happens this time around."

After appx 1-yr taking paroxetine, I can say my anxiety levels are much, much lower and 100% manageable.  Even when high-stress events occur, my stress and anxiety levels equalize very quickly.

I have chosen to take only 5 mg of Paxil for the panic attacks I ""USE"" to get.  I only need enough to ""HELP"". I have taken Paxil off and on for 12 years. I was prescribed 20mg..I break that in half..then break the halves in half.,(5mg). To get off, go slowly. Start cutting down weekly..then the next week even less.. to the point. Take it every other day..until you can stop totally, to give ""YOUR"" body a test and rest from drugs. Panic attacks are very difficult to deal with at times. I understand the choaking,,breathing feeling..pounding heart,,etc. I hate it that I have to take it...but it is better for me as well as my family that may suffer with me NOT taking it.  Depression, panic attacks and OCD, runs in my family. With other pressures of life..and what ""PEOPLE"" may expect from one...Attacks can become..over whelming..so why not take Paxil?  I am 55..gone through 2 car accidents, Malignant Melanoma diagnosis, surgeries, chemo within 1 year.  Paxil..I TOOK !  I use to get that BUZZ, many have talked about..fuzzy in the brain.. Paxil is working..nureons (spelling?), and brain transmitters, are re-uptaking seritonin. If I have to choose...I will choose to take Paxil. By the way..20mg of Paxil...made me feel..""I TOTALLY DID NOT CARE"". Therefore....to stronge.  Know your body.., trust your gut feelings.  My doctor gets piffy..about what I decide to take...but then he says: It works for you, who knows you better than yourself. Remember, the Docs go by the FDA studies. ( IN GENERAL). I do the opposite of instructions on Paxil..start out low...and if needed I would go higher. So far, worked out great.

I have been taking this medication for over 5 years now.  It has completely rid me of all anxiety which is great! I do suffer from some of the side effects of the medication, muscle spasms (occasionally) and low sex drive. This is a daily dose medication.  I have missed taking it on occasion usually for only one day which is fine.  You usually will not feel any different.  However on occasion I have missed taking it for two days.  On the second day you start to feel very dizzy and your body starts to tingle.  Its hard to concentrate on anything. It is very important not to miss taking this medication daily.  There are definetly withdrawl symptoms!

In the beginning the low dose helped.  As time went by I had to increase the dose.  In low dose this medicine is good.  At the highest dose of 60mg it is not great.  I was to the point that I wanted to sleep all the time and could no matter what time of day it was.  I would take 4 hour naps on the weekends.  You become semi emotionally numb and the sex drive disappears.  I am in the process of stepping down off this medicine to cymbalta.  I have my sex drive back and do not sleep well anymore.  So no more drowsiness.  I thing it is a good change for me.

However, I had no idea that stopping ""cold turkey"" was a problem, as my doctor didnt say anything about it. Stopping caused me severe dizzyness and headaches and hot/cold flashes, and it also made my body temperature change up & down like a yo-yo!! I dont know how long this will last but it is 4 days now and I cant stand the dizzyness anymore.
I am not sure what to do now, but maybe starting and staying on it is a good idea. I too have gained weight, I thought it was because I didnt feel like doing anything but sleeping. "

Takes away obsessive thoughts, clears the webs of negative thought. I have taken it 3x for a year each time. Each time I gained 20 pounds. One time I exercised daily for 60 min and didn't lose weight. Takes away libido completly. I take this in an emergency (very stressed, panicky, paranoid,insomnia and depressed).
