I took the smallest dose during this time. The first two years were ok. When this medication takes over it WILL destroy your life. It should be discontinued as a medicine.
1$Condition: Other$12/28/2017 7:54:18 PM$Reviewer: linda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was finally given this medication after suffering with severe daily anxiety for six months. I have only been on it for a week. I worked immediately, and the anxiety is dwindling away. I agree with one of the other reviewers in that it saved my life.
2$Condition: Other$7/15/2016 4:42:55 PM$Reviewer: Pam512, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $4$1$5$My mother's psychiatrist had her on this drug to help her sleep.  It worked, but now she has a hard time walking and she has several other things wrong with her that are apparently side effects of this drug.  I can't believe her doctor prescribed this pill for sleep.  She has taken my mother off of it, but now my mother will probably never be able to walk right.  The doctor even suggested she go to a neurologist because she thought she might have Parkinson's.  It bothers me that the doctor didn't know that this drug may cause Parkinson's symptoms.  I am beyond furious.
3$Condition: Other$5/24/2016 6:21:48 PM$Reviewer: R C J , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$1$4$I had psychosis. I took this medication because of the psychosis and possible bipolar. I was very tired the first two weeks of use. I went from 150 pounds to 183 pounds within a month and a half of use. It helped with the psychosis, but the weight gain was not worth it. I am trying to get off of this medication.

So my psychiatrist started me on a low dose of Olanzapine. It works great; I finally got a good night's sleep.

7$Condition: Other$11/30/2012 7:43:26 PM$Reviewer: agelbert, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$4$Stopped my anxiety attacks (two recent visits to ER). At the ER they gave me lorazepam. My doctor put me on 5 mg per day olanzapine because lorazepam is a depressant and could trigger another anxiety atack (paradoxically even though it is an antianxiolitic) before the flouxetine he also prescribed stabilizes me. I had to reduce to 2.5 mg after first dose of olanzapine because of severe lethargy (My doctor said it was okay to split the 5 mg pill in half - NOTE: He made sure I was NOT a diabetic prior to prescribing olanzapine with a fasting blood test). I was also prescribed 20 mg fluoxetine a day. I am a bipolar-I with no manic episode for over 15 years but a constant struggle with depression. I took fuoxetene for over 10 years and had been off it and any other medication but 81 mg of aspirin a day for over three years. I had never had an anxiety attack in my life before this. I am now one week into this therapy. I was given olanzapine as a bridge for two or three weeks until the fluoxetene kicks in to prevent depression triggered anxiety attacks. So far I have had some dry mouth and a very brief tingling and numbness in my hands but nothing serious. However, due to the fact that olanzapine modifies body chemistry to try to favor metabolizing lipids in a higher priority than carbohydrates (the reverse of normal biochemistry), I wouldn't want to take this drug too long. That mechanism is what can lead to diabetes type II.
