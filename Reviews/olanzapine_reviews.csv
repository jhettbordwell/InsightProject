I took the smallest dose during this time. The first two years were ok. When this medication takes over it WILL destroy your life. It should be discontinued as a medicine.

2$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$1/11/2019 12:08:40 PM$Reviewer: Sue, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I had been taking Cymbalta an antidepressant for depression and anxiety symptoms. The Cymbalta was working well but I would still have occasional flare-ups of depression and anxiety with racing thoughts and repetitive thoughts when certain situations would arise. This additional medication started working immediately on the smallest dos. It does make me sleepy but my racing thoughts and repetitive thoughts are gone after just 2 days and now I'm on my fifth day. this is an absolute Lifesaver for me. My head is clear I can concentrate and my mood is even more positive and elevated. with the addition of this medication I will probably even be able to back down a little bit oh my Cymbalta dose.  I feel like the self That I Used to Be 30 years ago before I got sick. for me this is been a miracle drug. I pray for the people that struggle the way I have that this will work just as well for them.

7$Condition: Schizophrenia$12/1/2016 3:11:12 AM$Reviewer: Gomedfree, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$"Olanzapine did not work for me, my psychosis symptoms did not improve at all, if anything it made them worse. 

It made me constantly dizzy and very tired. I could barely function, or even keep my eyes open, I would sometimes fall asleep sitting up. Constant napping there was no choice. I felt like a zombie with no feelings or emotions which is worse than my original condition imo. And the worst part is you do not have a sex life when on this medication at all! No desire to have sex, it actually hurts to have sex and it's impossible to orgasm

I was a pretty small person to begin with around 120-125 and I eat a healthy low carb/sugar diet, no processed foods mostly organic fresh vegtables and oils, never over eating. So when my doctor told me that I would probably gain weight I didn't think it would actually happen but I took it for 7 months and I ended up weighing 166! It was so depressing and now I have permanent stretch marks on my body :( I don't take any medication any more and I honestly feel so much better. Also if you research olanzapine it's a pretty dangerous drug and has killed a lot of people.   "

It worked, but now she has a hard time walking and she has several other things wrong with her that are apparently side effects of this drug.  I can't believe her doctor prescribed this pill for sleep.  She has taken my mother off of it, but now my mother will probably never be able to walk right.  The doctor even suggested she go to a neurologist because she thought she might have Parkinson's.  It bothers me that the doctor didn't know that this drug may cause Parkinson's symptoms.  I am beyond furious.

I took this medication because of the psychosis and possible bipolar. I was very tired the first two weeks of use. I went from 150 pounds to 183 pounds within a month and a half of use.

11$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$5/21/2016 8:29:02 PM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$"It is unconscionable that a website that holds itself out as a provider of accurate information would say that this drug ""restores the balance"" of ""natural"" substances in the brain. This theory has been disproved for more than three decades and is complete poppycock. In clinical trials, this drug performed no better than typical antipsychotics and led to more side effects. That's because olanzapine doesn't target any particular neurological system in the brain, but basically targets all of them in crap shoot fashion. Disrupting any of them (dopaminergic, serotinergic, etc.) leads to dramatic side effects, and that is exactly what this drug does: it DISRUPTS those systems - it doesn't ""restore"" them to balance. That's not to mention the nasty, prolonged withdrawal syndrome you will experience when and if you try to get off of it. "

So my psychiatrist started me on a low dose of Olanzapine. It works great; I finally got a good night's sleep.
13$Condition: Schizophrenia$4/5/2016 11:19:15 PM$Reviewer: maxine dare, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I took largactil from 1980 - 98 - not a very nice drug and it gave me tardive dystonia - restricted the movement in my neck.  In 1999 a new psychiatrist gave me olanzapine - it made me relaxed with a slight feeling of euphoria - My whole body was relaxed not like the stiffness I had all the years I took largactil - I even got my normal handwriting back!  Olanzapine also helps with sleep - including when an inpatient on a noisy ward. It was a new drug then and my psychiatrist said that some of his patients were calling it a miracle drug. It does increase the appetite - about an hour after a meal I would feel very hungry again.  A doctor said to me watch that - I did not and put 3 stone of weight on.  However my psychiatrist said that after a certain time on olanzapine - at least a year the appetite goes back to normal.  This was true and after a lot of abstinence I lost all the 3 stone in weight.  I would feel very tired early - about 9 pm but at least I got up in the morning easily - when I took largactil it was very hard to get up in the morning.  It is a much better and safer drug.  The only other side effect I noticed was a slight twitch at the side of my mouth - once every 3 or 4 months.  After several years the tardive dystonia improved somewhat.  Sadly, when I went to hospital for a rest and to avoid the kids smashing my windows in 2011 - so I was not ill - I offended the psychiatrist (different man from before) and the staff so they forced on me risperidone knowing it was a torture and made me stay on it for months.  It did horrid things to my body, made the tardive dystonia worse again and took away all sleep.  That psychiatric ward should be closed down because the staff are very cruel. However the drug Olanapine was great for me.

17$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$1/23/2015 7:24:49 PM$Reviewer: overboard, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I was first diagnosed with major depression when I was 10.  I had a series of events that led up to my diagnosis: raped by a priest; narcissistic mother that divorced my father for money; was told I was completely responsible for my mother's happiness by my mother, father tried to commit suicide all before I was 9.  I begged my mother to take me to a psychiatrist or psychologist.  She didn't want to take me because it would embarrass her.  After 1 year of begging she finally took me, for 2 sessions.  I took extra courses during the school year, and finished my first 2 years of college before my 16th birthday so I could get away from what was adding to my problems.  On my 16th birthday I left home and stayed with a friend for a month until I graduated.  I was still under my step-father's insurance and I made an appointment to see a doctor.  It wasn't long into the first session that he realized the diagnosis of Major Depression was correct.  I never experienced happiness or mania and was placed on Prozac.  It definitely helped for a couple of years.  I was still depressed, but not suicidal.  Eventually in my early 20's I found the psychiatrist, that also did therapy, who saved my life.  I tried every anti-depressant, Cymbalta made me suicidal, but ended up finding something that worked, and he gave me xanax for my panic attacks.  So many years later I still suffer from depression, self-worth, self-esteem.  My doctor just put me on this drug to augment the prozac, to augment the Effexor.  I asked him for something for anxiety and panic attacks.  The reviews all seem to be negative.  Has anyone experienced a positive reaction, less depression, less anxiety.  If not I will go back to the doctor immediately.  Thank you for any feedback.

Since I started on taking this about 8 or 9 months ago, I have had some major changes. On the positive I see fewer ""shadows"" and hear fewer things. I take a combination of medications and have for over 15 years. My family and I, all noticed the change for the better, after about 3 months of adding this to my regimen. I would recommend this to anyone that suffers from some of the same issues. The worst thing about it, to me is the weight gain; it's been drastic for me. I gained about 15 to 20 pounds in the first 2-3 months. I have always had an ""over active"" metabolism, but this is the first time in my life I've been overweight. I feel the effect it's had for me is worth the weight gain; it's the 1st medication that has had a major effect other then Prozac. I just have to exercise a little more than before. "

At the ER they gave me lorazepam. My doctor put me on 5 mg per day olanzapine because lorazepam is a depressant and could trigger another anxiety atack (paradoxically even though it is an antianxiolitic) before the flouxetine he also prescribed stabilizes me. I had to reduce to 2.5 mg after first dose of olanzapine because of severe lethargy (My doctor said it was okay to split the 5 mg pill in half - NOTE: He made sure I was NOT a diabetic prior to prescribing olanzapine with a fasting blood test). I was also prescribed 20 mg fluoxetine a day. I am a bipolar-I with no manic episode for over 15 years but a constant struggle with depression. I took fuoxetene for over 10 years and had been off it and any other medication but 81 mg of aspirin a day for over three years. I had never had an anxiety attack in my life before this. I am now one week into this therapy. I was given olanzapine as a bridge for two or three weeks until the fluoxetene kicks in to prevent depression triggered anxiety attacks. So far I have had some dry mouth and a very brief tingling and numbness in my hands but nothing serious. However, due to the fact that olanzapine modifies body chemistry to try to favor metabolizing lipids in a higher priority than carbohydrates (the reverse of normal biochemistry), I wouldn't want to take this drug too long. That mechanism is what can lead to diabetes type II.

Only downside to this is that I change back quickly if I miss a pill.

This medication was magic for the first 3 nights then I developed severe swollen knee joints and by the 5 day I couldn't bend my knees to walk up a step. Doctor took me off the meds and my knees returned to normal but the restless legs came back with a vengance.  I was told to take a magnesium and calcium suppliment and the restless leg problem went away.

Therefore, i take my dose at 10pm every night. When i wake up around 8am, my brain feels like it has been 'erased' from the previous manic day.I feel refreshed, although a bit sluggish from medication 'hang-over'. This goes away with a cup of coffee and a bit of fresh air and sunshine in the morning.The first person i speak with actually sets the mood for me for that day.[please be in a cheerful mood for me!!!]

69$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$10/16/2007 10:42:39 AM$Reviewer: Kokopelli, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Presented with an extreme manic/pschotic episode and initially diagnosed schizoform. Medication was very effective within 2-3 days. On reflection my major side effect was mild/moderate depression. Continued medication for 1 1/2 years until moving out of state.

Was then rediagnosed Bipolar and was recommended to switch medications to a combination of Depakote and Citalopram. I reluctantly made the switch eventually without trouble.

Since then I have had one instance when severe stress has allowed the manic phase to 'leak through'. I was again given Olanzapine and the manic symptoms disappeared immediately. I was able to discontinue Olanzapine within 1-2 weeks.

My psychiatrist and I now use Depakote as the background medication for the manic phase and on any indication of returning manic symptoms we use Olanzapine as a temporary 'brake' with great effectiveness."
