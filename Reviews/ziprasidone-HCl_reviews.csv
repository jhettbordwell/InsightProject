I lost 20lbs everyone asked if I was working out. I still don't know how I'm supposed to be feeling. if you miss a dose you will not be able sleep. and you will sleep a lot -10-12hours. I went off zeldox cold turkey. my speech was better. my tongue was swollen and that went back to normal. I had hacking coughs choking on my own spit .the spit would go down the wrong way. I did not tell my doctor. I thought things were going fine. I told him that I wasn't taking my pills I am now on latuda. I have had it for about a month. im not sure how I am am to feel
1$Condition: Schizophrenia$8/24/2014 3:57:12 PM$Reviewer: Anne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$2$"I was prescribed this medicine because I hear voices. It has worked very well, despite having a difficult time transitioning onto it. I have heard some voices, but they are minimal. However, we had to put me on such a high dosage that I was falling asleep in class. Even on a lower dosage, I had to take an hour to two-hour nap every day and could not stay awake for more than thirty minutes in the car. Then we switched to taking it all at night (another rough transition) but I was still low on energy, so we lowered it again.
We are thinking of lowering the dosage once more, but it is incredibly scary gambling with mental illness, especially during the semester. I can only pray I will not hear voices again.
This drug has the worst withdrawal out of every anti-psychotic I have taken. If I miss the time I'm supposed to take it by two hours, or even one, I begin to feel terrible. My pupils dilate significantly during withdrawals. If I miss taking it during a meal and take it on an empty stomach, it does not kick in for at least an hour. It keeps me awake when I have not taken it as well.
Even talking about this medicine makes me feel terrible. I can only hope that I will eventually switch onto another medication without an episode."

5$Condition: Schizophrenia$1/24/2013 8:58:06 PM$Reviewer: Schizobus, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I suffer schizoaffective disorder. I switched from Abilify to Geodon mostly because I could only tolerate a low dose of Abilify, which wasn't providing enough therapeutic value. I now take 60mg of Geodon in the morning with breakfast and 80mg of Geodon in the evening with dinner for a total of 140mg daily. I have been taking over 100mg of Geodon daily for about two years now. Geodon helps prevent my psychosis and balances out my mood. I suffer bad akathisia in the evening a few times a week for a few hours with this drug. Most of the time I just try to sleep when akathisia strikes and I awake feeling better. I sleep a lot on this drug: I usually sleep 5 to 7 hours a night and then another 2 to 4 hours in a nap. I find it crucial to take my doses with a meal, as the oral bioavailability is allegedly reduced in half when consuming the drug without food. I sometimes feel as though I withdraw from the drug if I take my dose off schedule or if I have been unable to consistently take the drug with a meal. The withdrawal begins to manifest in symptoms of anxiety and nausea. I have never been overweight but my weight has fluctuated quite a bit in a range of 40lbs since I started taking antipsychotic drugs. I find Geodon doesn't make me gain so much weight for an antipsychotic but I currently have a BMI of 22. Geodon is probably my favorite neuroleptic of the five that I have tried so far.

I'm schizoaffective. This medication really helps with the psychotic symptoms of my disorder like the delusions and the hallucinations. It also helps me sleep at night since I take it in the evening. I get blood draws every 6 months to keep an eye on my blood sugar levels. Am taking Geodon with Depakote ER, and Zoloft. Works great together. Actually feel productive and ""normal"" most days."

When prescribed geodon at a hospital it solved all of my diagnosis problems. I was raised to a place where negative thoughts didn't exist, I looked for fear and the resulting loss of control of thoughts and feelings and was glad to realize fear didn't come even when I was looking for it. Finally I felt pleasure which is hard to come by. It was my miracle drug until the Grand Mal seizure as a result of an allergy to the drug. I have suffered several years since and now take 6 meds. I wish there was a drug to take with the geodon to avoid the allergic reactions. Alternately I want to try Invegra.

I lose 40lbs so far. At first I was on Zyprexa and it made me gain 10 pounds every month so I'm thankful that I'm losing weight now. Plus I don't hear voices anymore.

It has worked for me and does not make me feel stiff like some of the other drugs, however it makes my shake especially in my legs and feel a bit weak sometimes.

(I never hallucinated that much that intensely before I took it.) Then I started to get dizzy and my face would go numb as it wore off. I also would twitch and tense my leg muscles as I tried to relax. Over 4 months of taking it I became emotionally numb, very quiet, and distant from my family. I also required 9-10 hours of sleep at night. When I tried something else I was dizzy for three days like I was withdrawing from it. I don't know witch was worse the illness or the drug both hurt my house hold. Now I am taking seroquel 200mg to sleep and abilify 5mg in the morning. As of now (1 month)I have no noticeable side effects and I don't feel it ""wearing off"" like the geodon did. "

It has been excellent, but he is not doing well now, he is in a physcotic state and a manic state.  The doctor has increased his dosage and we are praying that it will help him very soon.  He is also on lithium.

First off it made me feel really restless and feverish then on the third day I was taking it a had tardive dyskinesia which is a big word meaning I lost all control of my facial muscles as well as my tongue. I though I was going to swallow my tongue. I ended up hhaving to go to the ER to get a shot to counteract the reaction. I stopped taking the geodon immediately.
19$Condition: Schizophrenia$9/14/2008 5:11:05 PM$Reviewer: Victor, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$3$"Yes, this medicine has been very effective when nothing else worked, but after 5 years I got excruciating headaches starting early in the year.... NONSTOP~!  After exhausting the ER with a trip a month and my Doctor's comprehensive tests, which showed nothing, we came to the conclusion that Geodon may be the culprit.  Have reduced meds slowly from 180 a day (topped at 200/day for a short period) down to 80, headaches are still there!  No one told me the consequences of getting off this stuff.  On top of the headaches, dry heaves, body aches, muscle jerking, it's been hell so far.  My Doctor (primary physician) has been researching this drug non stop and we hope to find an end to the pain.  My Psych doctor can't understand what I'm talking about, she's not heard of weaning off this drug being so difficult.  I know it's not just me.  

So far tho I'm adjusting to the upper doses of Seroquil to compensate for the Geodon and it's taking care of the mental issues for which I'm grateful.

However, everyone MUST be warned about the incredible difficulty PHYSICALLY getting off this drug.  Had I know it would be this painful and difficult I might have preferred the mental issues to dealing with this severe chronic pain every day.

Good luck and think twice about using this drug. "

I have been taking Geodon 80mg twice daily for years.  It is pretty effective at controlling my psychotic symptoms, anger, fear, etc. The only side effect I have noticed is that is makes me fall asleep. I've tried lower doses but symptoms came back. The sleepiness is intense and unpredictable. I often have to pull over the car if I'm driving because of it. After a short nap I'll be okay. The episodes of passing out made me lose my last job. Overall the side effect (sleep) controls my daily activities. Pretty rotten, but better than being controlled by a Demon.
