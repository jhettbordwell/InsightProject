1$Condition: Manic-Depression$12/15/2016 8:51:21 AM$Reviewer: Kristen8885, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$I was hospitalized due to a severe panic attack and the emergency psych doctor prescribed this medication to me.  Mind you I am only on Wellbutrin and Abilify for depression and anxiety.  Not knowing what this was and trusting him I filled the script.  I took one at night as directed when I returned home and within a half hour I dropped a full cup of coffee and almost fell down my steps outside.  My fianc√© literally carried me to bed and I don't remember much afterward.  I brought this to my doctor who in turn said that I should have never been prescribed this and to stop taking it immediately.  Long story short I did not like the way this made me feel incapable of caring for myself or my children so I will not be taking this anymore.  Supposedly this is to be used in emergency situations in the hospital?

I started on 40mg, split in morning and evening. I got the shakes and got very tired in the afternoon but not in the evening.

Moved to 40mg at night. Zombie action

Dropped to 20mg at night. Seemed okay for a while. Psychosis was about 90% controlled. Over a few months I felt like I had no energy and I was losing muscle mass and feeling weak.

Doc ordered a testosterone test, it was dangerously low. She order a prolactin and thyroid test. Thyroid was good, prolactin was three times the high normal range. 

Tapered off, both testosterone and prolactin levels were back to normal inside a month.

I never got near the therapeutic dose."

I was hospitalized due to these symptoms and the doctors were talking about ECT treatments but I refused them all together. Since I have been on Geodon I haven't had a bad episode of Mania. I also take Latuda for the depression which has made all the difference. It has been a year now since I started the Geodon and I take 80 MG twice a day and have been under control. I recommend this drug to anyone who has Bipolor 1 if they can tolerate it.

I went off zeldox cold turkey. my speech was better. my tongue was swollen and that went back to normal. I had hacking coughs choking on my own spit .the spit would go down the wrong way. I did not tell my doctor. I thought things were going fine. I told him that I wasn't taking my pills I am now on latuda. I have had it for about a month. im not sure how I am am to feel

6$Condition: Other$12/2/2015 9:16:29 PM$Reviewer: qwerty, 45-54 Male  (Patient) $3$3$3$"For psychosis. 20 MG in the evening.

I used to take 20 in the morning also but caused me to shake and become overly tired. 

Nighttime dose does not give me this side effect, oddly.

No other noticeable side-effects. It did not cause any weight-gain, in fact it suppressed my appetite enough to help be lose 32 pounds in the past 3 months, I also changed my diet and exercised more so it wasn't just the drug that made me lose weight. 

The lighter side-effects and doesn't block weight gain makes it a much better drug than most anti-psychotics."
7$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$10/25/2015 5:06:58 PM$Reviewer: Tara , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$I was diagnosed with Bipolar I in 2005 when I had my first manic episode. I came off my medicine (lithium) in 2011 and just had my second manic episode (10/15/15). The attending physician put me on generic Geodon after I told him it was what the doctor's used to get me down in 2005. I had no idea you could use the drug as a maintenance drug. I hated getting my blood drawn while on lithium so I really like Geodon. I'm on 40 mg twice a day but my doctor already mentioned my dose will be increased. I do have restlessness and nausea in the morning but I'll take these side effects over the paranoid depression state I've been in for the last 3 years off medication. I'm really happy with the drug.

9$Condition: Other$9/5/2015 6:19:04 AM$Reviewer: Greybo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was taking this med for alcoholism.  After my latest trip to the ER then being admitted for 4 days and almost leaving this world, I finally woke up to how serious this really is.  Zipra has helped to pretty much stop all cravings and even makes my stomach turn when I smell it.  I took it twice a day for a week then weaned down to once a day for another week and now I am off of it.  If my cravings come back, I will definitely go to my doctor for a new prescription if it.  Two weeks may not be enough to get me strong enough to go solo yet.  I highly recommend it to others battling alcoholism and are finally ready to make the jump to sobriety.  Something before I could never achieve. My thoughts are clear and it feels so good.  My mood is very good most of the time.  I'm not Mary Poppins, but I'm not a grumpy bear like others times I've quit for even shorter amounts of time. Two weeks and two days today.  Baby steps and this med really has helped me.

11$Condition: Schizophrenia$8/24/2014 3:57:12 PM$Reviewer: Anne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$2$"I was prescribed this medicine because I hear voices. It has worked very well, despite having a difficult time transitioning onto it. I have heard some voices, but they are minimal. However, we had to put me on such a high dosage that I was falling asleep in class. Even on a lower dosage, I had to take an hour to two-hour nap every day and could not stay awake for more than thirty minutes in the car. Then we switched to taking it all at night (another rough transition) but I was still low on energy, so we lowered it again.
We are thinking of lowering the dosage once more, but it is incredibly scary gambling with mental illness, especially during the semester. I can only pray I will not hear voices again.
This drug has the worst withdrawal out of every anti-psychotic I have taken. If I miss the time I'm supposed to take it by two hours, or even one, I begin to feel terrible. My pupils dilate significantly during withdrawals. If I miss taking it during a meal and take it on an empty stomach, it does not kick in for at least an hour. It keeps me awake when I have not taken it as well.
Even talking about this medicine makes me feel terrible. I can only hope that I will eventually switch onto another medication without an episode."

Crawled (somehow--don't remember) to bathroom  and crawled back to bed--don't remember how.  At 11am the next morning my Mother came to check on me because she'd called me several times w/no answer--I was completely dead drunk...and I don't drink alcohol.  BUT I do take Mirapex and 2 MG of Klonopin and 600 MG of Gabapintin at night. These help me sleep, hold down the extreme anxiety after a manic period. Psych said this was a drug usually administered in the hospital where it could be watched--uh-huh....How I wish this would've worked.  It took me 1 hour to eat one piece of toast at 12pm that 1st day because I kept going to sleep while I was eating it.  Thank goodness for a Mother who has put up with the evil ""Ms. Hyde"" and still finds time to care for her daughter instead of deserving the daughter to take care of and enjoy time with her.

30$Condition: Schizophrenia$1/24/2013 8:58:06 PM$Reviewer: Schizobus, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I suffer schizoaffective disorder. I switched from Abilify to Geodon mostly because I could only tolerate a low dose of Abilify, which wasn't providing enough therapeutic value. I now take 60mg of Geodon in the morning with breakfast and 80mg of Geodon in the evening with dinner for a total of 140mg daily. I have been taking over 100mg of Geodon daily for about two years now. Geodon helps prevent my psychosis and balances out my mood. I suffer bad akathisia in the evening a few times a week for a few hours with this drug. Most of the time I just try to sleep when akathisia strikes and I awake feeling better. I sleep a lot on this drug: I usually sleep 5 to 7 hours a night and then another 2 to 4 hours in a nap. I find it crucial to take my doses with a meal, as the oral bioavailability is allegedly reduced in half when consuming the drug without food. I sometimes feel as though I withdraw from the drug if I take my dose off schedule or if I have been unable to consistently take the drug with a meal. The withdrawal begins to manifest in symptoms of anxiety and nausea. I have never been overweight but my weight has fluctuated quite a bit in a range of 40lbs since I started taking antipsychotic drugs. I find Geodon doesn't make me gain so much weight for an antipsychotic but I currently have a BMI of 22. Geodon is probably my favorite neuroleptic of the five that I have tried so far.

Finally I felt pleasure which is hard to come by. It was my miracle drug until the Grand Mal seizure as a result of an allergy to the drug. I have suffered several years since and now take 6 meds.

48$Condition: Other$11/1/2010 8:33:10 AM$Reviewer: nootropics, 35-44 Male  (Patient) $5$5$4$Schizoaffective disorder.  Hospitalised against will 6 times due to psychosis and mania.  Medications used since 1997: mood stabilizers- lithium, valproate, lamotrigine; antipsychotics- risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, quetiapine, aripiprazole; antidepressants- venlafaxine, fluoxetine, reboxetine, paroxetine, mianserin all under close supervision of treating psychiatrist.  Results of ziprasidone monotherapy: only drug that works particularly for refractory bipolar depression and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Concerns over lack of efficacy due to underdosing in clinical practice.  Small side-effect footprint so can be used for maintenance therapy.  Without this drug I would be facing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  Currently taking 40mg morning and 120mg night (to better regulate sleep rhythms).  Ziprasidone has unique pharmacodynamic action in that it is like an antidepressant/mood stabilizer/antipsychotic rolled into one (dopamine/serotonin modulator plus serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor).  Can adjust dose to achieve required mood stabilization but can over-activate at lower doses (cause mania/hypomania).  Action on alpha 1 adrenoreceptors probably causes the cardiovascular side effects (vasodilation= reduced cardiac output=hypotension=dizziness) but this is minor compared with results.  QT interval overhyped.  Vastly improved energy, activation, mood and thinking.  Previously I had to abort medical studies due to illness.  After 7 years out of work, I have been able to return to study a Masters degree.  Remember people to SLOWLY do anything to do with dosing! (titrate over weeks/months).  Take REGULARLY (same time each day with food, don't miss).  Has no weight gain, good for blood lipids/sugars.  My turnaround in first month was remarkable; like an awakening.  Averaged 5 hours sleep but not manic.  Best I've been for 20 years.  If can't tolerate ziprasidone, next best is aripiprazole.  Try everything else, then try the best: ZIPRASIDONE!

I'm tired of feeling so blah all the time. no fun without the highs. I don't miss the lows though at all. It has kept those away so I might just cut back on my mg. Have to talk to my Dr. about it.

The psych decided to give me Geodon to boost Pristiq to help my depression as I am not getting complete relief with Pristiq.
I took Geodon for a total of 4 days.  I was off from work all week because of Geodon.  The first 2 days I took 20mg and felt as if my equilibrium was off & I was off-balance.  Also, for someone who goes to bed by 9:00pm every night, I was up until 1:00am all 4 nights, and even with 6 hrs of sleep, I felt fine the next day.  Everything about what I did and felt was out of character for me.  By the time I hit day 4, I was in the emergency room.  My blood pressure increased to 188/110, I had chest pain, and experienced a day-long panic attack.  It's been 2 weeks since I stopped taking Geodon and I still am experiencing chest pain.  My psych had me stop Geodon and now wants me to take Abilify.  He says that after Geodon, the chest pain I feel is a symptom of a manic episode.  Funny... I NEVER experienced a manic episode in my entire LIFE and it wasn't until I took Geodon that I did. 
I need to go see a regular MD to make sure there isn't any permanent cardiovascular damage, as I still feel awful.  This drug is dangerous in my opinion.  If your doctor prescribes this for you, be sure you are monitored VERY carefully.  This is not a drug you mess with at all."

I was previously on a low dose of Abilify. And let me tell you, Geodon has made my moods so stable and I actually let things go with my mom when we fight. I used to fight with her every day, and they got really bad. But now I just let things go real easy. 
Thing is, the side effects are RIDICULOUS on me. It started with me not hearing my alarm in the morning and waking up late... only to still be in sleep mode for the next 4 hours. Ever woken up and you can't keep your eyes open because you're so tired? Multiply that by twelve and add puffy, bloodshot eyes. I still haven't woken up to a day where I'm not tired. And I'm usually really good with that kind of stuff. And the dizziness... oh my gosh. It's really bad. I've been on tons of medications for ADHD and Bipolar, never have I had side effects like this.

If it helped at all, it was because I slept throughout the entire day and was not mentally present in the hours that I was awake.  I struggled with debilitating exhaustion, inability to concentrate, involuntary head movements, and muscles seizing among many other adverse effects for several months. Finally, after having a small seizure during an exam, I decided enough was enough and gradually lessened the dosage over the period of a week until I wasn't taking any at all.  It took several weeks for the effects to wear off, and thankfully none of them have reoccurred.  But I would suggest extreme caution when deciding to take this drug.  In addition to being expensive and incredibly difficult to handle, it didn't seem to solve or treat the mood swings-- only knock me out to the point where I didn't have the wherewithal to feel much of anything.

I also would twitch and tense my leg muscles as I tried to relax. Over 4 months of taking it I became emotionally numb, very quiet, and distant from my family. I also required 9-10 hours of sleep at night. When I tried something else I was dizzy for three days like I was withdrawing from it.

When this happens it can lead to shortness of breath, diareah,changes in mental status and irregular heartbeat. However you can have your doctor first check to see if you are low in magnesium, then , if you are low in magnesium, your doctor can prescribe the right kind of magnesium( pill supplement and food high in magnesium, such as spinach, almonds, cashews, soybeans, etc.) Then this approach, I think,  will work very well( as I have tried and seems to be working) . Another HUGE BONUS is that you do not gain weight on this medication! As a matter of fact , I was on Zyprexa , but on Zyprexa I gained 50 LBS.But on Zeldox , (ZIPRASIDONE-ORAL-only 20mg.) since I have been on it( 10 weeks), I have lost 20 lbs.

The med is to expensive, going to the doc and counselor is exspensive I really think its all about the money and not my health. Geodon sucked the life out of me no one likes to be around me Im not fun I have no personality anymore. I take it at night but I can't function in the morning VERY SLEEPY. Im very zombie like. In bipolar(which I don't think I am) I experience hypomania the most so could it be more me being hyperactive as one would be with ADHD, yeah think so.  Im quit taking it and I will be back to my old self soon. Doctors are a big waste of time. Screw the labels I just want to get better and enjoy my life and have others around me enjoy me again...

I took one tablet and it made my facial muscles freeze to the side, my eyes roled to the back of my head. My jaw was stuck so far to the side that my gums started bleeding from my teeth pushing into them so hard. I started spitting blood. It was all so uncontrollable im just scared for my life right now. I thought I had serious brain damage. Luckily for me the symtoms wore off. But I dont know if they might come back or not. Im not bipolar and I dont have a mental illness. Taking this drug was the worst mistake of my life. And I was told it was a harmless medication for sleeping like seroquell. It ended up being a bleepin nightmare. This all happened to me yesterday and today. I went into the ER. My doctor is now telling me I need an MRI of my brain. I might have serious brain damage. All I can do is warn people out there. Before you take this consider the side effects. They are as serious as anything. Id rather be dead than experience that torment that this drug inflicted on me.

The therapist was thinking I had shades of being bipolar and this drug was starting to be used as a mood stabilizer. I thought it was a miracle. I felt like my real self again, happy, laughing and was even able to take my young daughter on a week-end trip. (The only time I've been well enough to take her anywhere.) I had no side effects, it was easy to take, but it stopped working after 3 months. I was crushed and back in the abyss again. In the last two years I have finally been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. While it didn't work very long for me, I had one happy summer and I believe it could be very effective for others.

NONSTOP~!  After exhausting the ER with a trip a month and my Doctor's comprehensive tests, which showed nothing, we came to the conclusion that Geodon may be the culprit.  Have reduced meds slowly from 180 a day (topped at 200/day for a short period) down to 80, headaches are still there!  No one told me the consequences of getting off this stuff.  On top of the headaches, dry heaves, body aches, muscle jerking, it's been hell so far.  My Doctor (primary physician) has been researching this drug non stop and we hope to find an end to the pain.  My Psych doctor can't understand what I'm talking about, she's not heard of weaning off this drug being so difficult.  I know it's not just me.  

So far tho I'm adjusting to the upper doses of Seroquil to compensate for the Geodon and it's taking care of the mental issues for which I'm grateful.

However, everyone MUST be warned about the incredible difficulty PHYSICALLY getting off this drug.  Had I know it would be this painful and difficult I might have preferred the mental issues to dealing with this severe chronic pain every day.

To get to the point, I have mood & thinking issues maybe part bipolar or part schizoid or some combination.  Geodon / Ziprasidone is a good medicine.  I have had better results, though, with a newer drug called Invega / Paliperidone.  They work very similarly and are in the same class of drugs.  The biggest difference, I think, is that Invega uses technology that lets the drug be released over a 24 hr period which helps manage symptoms better.  Due to the difficulty in diagnosint mental illness, I think in many cases people need to try combinations of drugs untill they find what works best.  I am on Invega 6 mg (switched from Geodon), Depakote ER 1500 mg, & Cymbalta 60 mg.  I think of it as attacking coexisting problems from multiple directions to be free or close to free of symptoms.  Good luck with your treatment..  Remember, Geodon is good but ask about Invega."

103$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$5/23/2008 1:09:05 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$2$"My Dr. started me off with 80 mgs at night & 80 mgs in the a.m.  It has controlled my manic episodes but I don't know if I can stay on the drug due to side effects (My Dr. even reduced my dosage to 60 mgs at night & 60 mgs in the a.m.).  I am extremely tired all the time, my muscles seem to move by themselves (like restless leg syndrome), & it makes me feel like a zombie.  I miss my happy/funny personality.  With this drug, there are no ups or downs, I just feel ""nothing"".  "

I have been taking Geodon 80mg twice daily for years.  It is pretty effective at controlling my psychotic symptoms, anger, fear, etc. The only side effect I have noticed is that is makes me fall asleep. I've tried lower doses but symptoms came back. The sleepiness is intense and unpredictable. I often have to pull over the car if I'm driving because of it. After a short nap I'll be okay. The episodes of passing out made me lose my last job. Overall the side effect (sleep) controls my daily activities. Pretty rotten, but better than being controlled by a Demon.

I've been depressed, but that's not what Geodon is trying to prevent.  I don't have any side effects.  I hope it works well in the long-run.

I don't have any side effects that I'm aware of. My doc sometimes has to adjust the anti-depressants that I take.  But the Geodone really helps me a lot with paranoia and the manic, angry side of this condition.

I have been taking it for two years now for my bi polar disorder, I'm hypo manic and it manifests itself in shopping of all things. And the Geodon really works for me because it controls my spending thousands of dollars on things I absolutely do NOT need. It helps me sleep too.
