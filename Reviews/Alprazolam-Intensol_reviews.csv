I struggle whether or not to take during day despite overwhelming anxiety since for me it is sleep inducing. When bad I take half -.25 and am ok...no side effects other than what it is recommended for. Am very pleased. 
1$Condition: Anxious$12/26/2017 12:29:37 PM$Reviewer: RT392, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more$5$5$5$I take .25-.5 mg at a time 6 times a day. Sometimes I'll take 1mg. I learned as long as I am not tired my dose is correct. Thank Gof for alprazolam. Valium is not strong enough. I can get much more done taking alprazolam. I think about what I have control over and not worry about stupid stuff.
2$Condition: Chronic Trouble Sleeping$11/5/2016 10:16:03 PM$Reviewer: ghostgirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$5$Xanax is the ONLY thing that allows me to sleep.Most of the time..I have tried EVERYTHING...Nothing works.Xanax is te only thing that works and taking 2 mgs at bed time,will help me sleep within a couple of hours...I am so jealous of people that can just...lie down and go to sleep.Sometimes? I hate them//Recently went FIVE days w/out any xanax.Coincidently,it was also FIVE days without sleep...Without this? Id never sleep and just....fade away into the ether......

12$Condition: Anxious$12/12/2009 12:04:52 AM$Reviewer: Gone Crazy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication was the first one my Dr. put on an it worked in two days.

13$Condition: Anxious$11/2/2009 1:23:39 AM$Reviewer: RIchard, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$The Dr. replace Zanax with this one.  It only took 20 mgs. to raise my B/P.  It usually stays around 110/58 or 112/62.  Now it hovers at 124/76 too high for me.  I have been on it for one day and and twelve hours later, I am trying to get it out of my system.  I cannot take it no more, I left word to the Dr. on his voice mail to go back to Xanax in the morning - .25 mg.  The worst part is that I am not depress - just anxious in my job.  Other effects are Rapid Heartbeat - Headaches - Dizziness - Not able to focus.  Thank goodness I took it one time only!
14$Condition: Other$10/31/2009 3:11:36 AM$Reviewer: Richard, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$" have been on this medication this July 8th, 2009 - I am taking .25mg for a recent Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). I have no side effects so far, Thank God! 

I have no side effects with this.  I am off it soon.  It worked during the recovery of my Mini-Stroke.
 
Remember this works for me, not everyone will have the same rssults. With the proper Diet and Excerise it does work. Richard J Bowden
