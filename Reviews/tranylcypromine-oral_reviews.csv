Approximately six months into taking this med I've experienced anger, great irritability (unlike me), intolerance,  no feelings of happiness which I did feel prior to taking this med.  Depression became worse and trouble sleeping at night.  Blood sugar level would increase while on this medication.  Also experienced trouble speaking. Overall not good for me.

There are many precautions to be aware of while taking it.  I have taken this drug for 40 years.  The dose is the same now as when I began.
