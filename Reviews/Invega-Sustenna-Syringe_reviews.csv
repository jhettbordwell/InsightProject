I don't even want to get up and cook or eat. I do though, and have gained 50  pounds. This drug has been a nightmare for me and I'm stopping it next month. I just hope I can get my life back afterwards. Depression has been a big issue and I feel dead. I don't see how anyone else can tolerate being on this medication. In the beginning it was not bad, but the side effects just kept on getting worse and worse. Today I'm a shell of my former self. Id rather have hallucinations and delusions than live like a zombie. If I was forced to take this medication then I'd rather be dead. I will quit cold turkey next month and I expect a wild ride. Maybe some day ill experience happiness again. Until then, I'm absolutely devastated and miserable.

I have been thru a lot including prison a few times and was always scared of doctors and medications. I was on Gordon and zyprexa and over the last year and a half all my medically treated fears came true. Apolypse hallucinations, paranoia, damage to my home and property, and this last episode I was committed to the pschward for 2 weeks and now that Iâ??ve been on this shot my life has made a 180. Iâ??m responding to other people reasonably, no hallucinations. Iâ??m not angry and paranoid anymore. Itâ??s only been a month, but it has made a huge difference in my life.

So many negative reviews, I’m assuming these people probably haven’t lived with Schizophrenia and are probably misdiagnosed because I’d give my left arm to finally feel like a functional part of society again.  It’s only been a week o The injection and after the initial pain of the injection sites subsided I felt and increase in hunger thirst restlessness and insomnia or lack there of. There is pain at the injection site a few days after the injection but after that pain subsides and get back to feeling normal within about five days Still fighting every day with delusions and regular schizophrenic things that tend to happen with schizophrenia but I am starting to realize that not all of them are actually real I’m starting to finally feel like the cloud is been lifted and I can finally differentiate between what is real and what is imagined.

5$Condition: Other$1/19/2018 4:03:45 PM$Reviewer: SeAndonahue, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$Horrible. Nothing to say anymore, dumber, fatter, weaker, loss of emotion. Heart pain, hurts to stand on feet, back pain, constant runny nose, sneeze all the time..memory is so shot. Sometimes I lose balance, had some painful acne. Hospitalized because I went blind with white light whenever I stood. Almost got lost in the parking lot because I couldn't see anything. Also sometimes have trouble putting words together, and I have brain farts where I forget the numbers or facts even though it was a couple seconds ago. Can't learn new materials no matter how many times I go over it. All I want to do is sleep, work is such a chore and I do barley any hours. Now I forget my dreams minutes after having them. Floods your brain receptors and stops them from firing, so brain dead is a literal statement. Also I developed such anxiety, I always think the worst is going to happen. Never had it before the injection. Can't swim anymore my arm doesn't contract and retract on the left side. As well I got OCD like it's so annoying, I always count like 2,4,6,8,10...all day. The only time I don't is when I sleep and I can't help it. Parents and psychiatrist forced me to take this since day one I never wanted to take it. Violated for life! It has a long half life but that's just blood not fat any your brain is %60 fat so I feel the dumbness lasts forever.

I don't take this medication but,my teen daughter does.  She just started taking it two days ago and I am slowly seeing results she still paces a bit but, very sleepy at times and seemed very sad/pouty for about 5 minutes and came back to being ok after I reassured her and hugged her.  They are taking her off some of her oral medications as she slowly adjusts to the injections.  The only thing is that she seems to have an extra healthy appetite but, if the voices go away or diminish substantially then it will be worth it.  I just have to keep her active in the meantime.  I don't let her mope around I will invent any reason I can think of to get her out of the house.  My only current concern is that she seems more like swollen than anything not fat but swollen.  I hope they come up with an inverna injection that does not cause any weight gain because that would make a young teen or any person truly happier and more active.  Before all this meds my daughter was 105lbs and now she is about 140lbs. she is 5ft 4in tall.  My daughter just turned 18.  
Question 4 should have the option to differentiate between the patient and caregiver personal stats information.  I hope the government gives more money for more research on mental illness.  It seems that mental illness is the stepchild illness when it comes to overall funding.  This and denial on the part of some families due to fear of stigmatizing their loved one has created an epidemic and its time we let go of that nonsense and talk openly about mental illness.  There is nothing to be ashamed of if you or someone in your family has mental illness of any kind. "

My adult son was like a caged animal on this stuff.  He would scream, hit his head with his fist, and kick holes in the wall.  His hallucinations were so creepy that he frightened me.  Every time I'd tell the doctor how awful it was, she'd say he needs to take the next dose, then the next.  He took it 6 months.  It was the most horrible six months of our lives, not to mention all the damage done to my home.  In case you might wonder, he was not using illegal drugs and not drinking alcohol.  We recently had testing through an orthomolecular Dr and learned that my son is under methylated (high histamine) and zinc deficient.  Don't know if that had anything to do with his problem on this med.  None of the meds have worked for him, but Invega Sustenna was absolutely the worst.

17$Condition: Schizophrenia$4/9/2015 9:44:44 PM$Reviewer: elise, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $4$5$5$My 18 year old son was diagnosed with schizophrenia about a year ago. It has been a really rough ride. He has tried a lot of drugs and even this one once before. As the dosage was lowered he got worse and the voices never left anyway,so we tried other drugs. Recently we came back to this one after I read a review on this site that one reviewer's voices didn't leave until after 5 months of use. I was hopeful to try it again. And sure enough between 5-6 months the voices stopped all of a sudden! He still talks to himself a lot, but says he is just used to doing so. He watches tv and plays video games, and goes out in public more. He also takes Cogentin, which helps with eye muscle spasms which started on some of the other drugs, so he just stayed on it. Overall, I am pleased with this drug. He is taking the 234 injection every 3 weeks.

With all medications used to treat mental issues one must take into consideration substances such as caffeine and time of usage, alcohol usage, age, how active(exercise,even if only walking of course in moderation), combinations of other medications, illicit drug usage, etc. and there are many other basic factors for which to identify and bring into the equation. Help yourself by using moderation in all situations basically. Common sense is not to be discounted as worthlessness! 
This medication has caused me some side effects such as diarrhea when raised to the 234mg dosage but for only about 3 weeks and then gone. It can cause as well as any other basic anti-psychotic weight gain(solution, exercise a little - go for a walk -a- bout regularly, but not to the exreme; walking is therapeutic anyway). Think about this: I can gain weight whether or not I have a mental issue; is that not true?
Having been given these shots for almost a year now, I believe this is one of the best medications on the market for my particular mental issues: bipolar I disorder, anxiety, borderline personality disorder of which there really is no medicine. 
For sure I started having anxiety issues as early as the 3rd grade and then at 14 full blown bipolar I disorder and was not diagnosed until 18; I am now 55. Medicines for abnormal mental issues have advanced beyond belief since I was first given such. 
Too often there are 2 evils: the problem for which medications are being given and the cure. A good internal medicine specialist in the field of psychiatry can be priceless and it goes w/o saying that communication to others w/similar infirmities might shed some light.
As is always said, ""Different strokes for different folks"" is very applicable. There is always hope; do not despair. Hang in there and have a good! "

They didnt work because I always forgot to take them and so I constantly was in and out of Psychotic episodes. Felt a difference after the first injection. The voices began to quiet. Was very sleepy in the beginning. And moody, but not raging. Mellowed out over a few months. The facial twitches and personality glitches started to fade away. I was able to interact with my family again and now have a great relationship with them that I cherish. I love my kids and am learning to function as a mother and a provider for the first time on my own in a safe an loving way. This drug truely has saved my life and the well being of my children and their upbringing. Unfortunately it has come with a price. I have gained 76 pounds in 7 months. My thyroid is effected. I have abnormal heart electrical signals. High blood sugar. I stop breathing in my sleep. I have constant swelling on the arms legs and feet. I look like Im 8 months pregnant. I sweat and am constantly hot and dehydrated. I get hives and skin rashes all the time. My face is swollen and puffy. My vision is blurry and I cant hardly taste my food. Seems the side effects are piling up faster and faster lately and Im totally bummed out about it. Im suffering through them because I have tried literally dozens of other medications that havent worked at all and this is the best I have found. For those that havent tried it, you should. Its great. Its peace of mind for those who havent had it. And a chance at normalcy. For now, the side effects wont stop me from continuing to take it. Im seeing a specialist to help. Ill keep you updated on if there is resulution. Its the best I have found in 20 years.

After trying other drugs I found the pills are fantastic in making one feel alert during the day. These are slow release tabs so you may have to take a sleeping pill to get to sleep. Now I've been taking the injections for two years. The first six months it takes a little more effort to stay awake during the day though with me this day sleepy feeling decreased. However I can still take day nap though the main reason for that is simply being bored in that I'd rather take a nap than stay awake. Night sleep is normal and you probably won't need a sleeping pill. On doses the first day seems the same as the last and there are no extreme highs or lows. I take the 117 dose. When considering the alternatives there is no other drug I'd rather be taking. Lucky for me with my insurance I can get three doses for $125."

I have written the Hague and reported administration of this drug on an involuntary basis is akin to a crime against humanity. The doctors who prescribe this ""medication"" or others like it ought to be tried for their crimes and brought to justice.    "

He just received the shot and is being monitored.  He seems calm and is able to better articulate his thoughts and think more rationally, but it is too soon to tell if this will help him to function as a normal 23 year old.  I'll post again as more time passes.

It lasts for 2 years from one shot and will make you a vegetable. I took one shot of this and it had me wanting to commit suicide all the time. My family thinks it has made me retarded and i am forced to live under the care of elders because of what its effects are every day. I have personnaly been messed up on one shot for 7 months and its as powerful as it ever has been. I recoomend no one recieve this medication and take it oraly if you must...this is more like torture and it should be reserved for pedofiles and rapists.

And the end results of not taken it was bad so for the sake of my children and family I took the shot and scared of needles but wasn't as bad as I thought. However it starting to make me feel tired and I just hope it make me eat cause I had to stop taken the one that made me eat so I get depressed and won't eat.

59$Condition: Other$5/8/2011 9:47:01 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I have schizoaffective disorder along with borderline personality disorder, and I've been on the Invega injection since October 2010 and I've been extremely happy with it. I was hallucination free for over 4 months which a small win for me.  I've been hearing voices since age 17 and I am now 25.   The voices are mildly coming back for several weeks now.  I am now able to study at the community college now and can concentrate better.  I have been on pretty much any mental health medicine you can think of since age 14.  The only medicines that have worked besides Invega are Risperdal Consta injection, Geodon, and Depakote, but I have to say the Invega injection is the best medicine I've been on by far.  As far as side effects I get hot and flush sometimes but it goes away maybe a half hour later.  This medicine ha changed my life for the better, I almost feel as good as I did when I was a child.

My son has been on this shot for about 9 months now and it has helped his symptoms considerably; he is more communicative and is resting better on this medication than any other he has tried recently. He is also on lithium as well. He still talks to himself some and paces around the house at times but considering how poorly he was doing on some of the other meds it’s a major improvement. He is able to set down and enjoy watching a little TV or play video games now where he wasn’t before this medicine. Be careful with any of these meds and good luck.

I am the mother of a 20 year old son on Invega Sustenna IM for 6 months.  He has not had any weight gain but he is more sleepy.  The drug has dramaticly lowered the voices but has not eliminated them all together.  The mood swings are reduced significantly but don't forget he is still a young adult.  
I as the care taker love the once a month injection.  I am no longer concerned with him being compliant with his medication.  
As a care taker I highly recommend this medication.  It is expensive but Medicaid does pay for it.  
Good Luck!!"

My symptoms that come with schizophrenia are gone after the 3rd shot.  The only negative is the side effect of weight gain.
