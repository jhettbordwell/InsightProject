It smoothed out my daily and seasonal mood gradient. I have had low side effects. In the last 3 years my kidneys weakened, but I am still taking a low dose, 150mg daily.
The WebMD information grossly exaggerates the risk of ""serotonin syndrome."" Compared to anti-depressants, lithium has very little effect on serotonin levels. Fear of serotonin syndrome should not factor into a patient's or a doctor's decision to try lithium.   "

He put mr on alprazolam after the valium and you CANT go from valium to alprazolam and survive. I started getting wicked withdrawals and my idiot dr prescribed me lithium along with an old AD. Why I even took them in the first place is a mystery since I never asked for these meds and even told him my sleep was great. Started feeling sick after tsking fir two days while on vacation with hitler and told my fiance (hitler) that they were making me sick and I needed to stop them. She got angry and demanded I keep taking them and I didnt want anymore silent treatment/anger...two weeks later I suffered brain, muscle, nerve and kidney damage!!! This has ruined my life and before I met my fiance I was fine. NEVER take crap from a partner and when you see red flags you run like hell!!! Also, be careful about taking meds in general...do you think depression was because a lack of prozac?! Sorry, ive read enough about big pharma, the fda and drs to know better....its all a scam. If you dont believe me thats fine but pretty soon itll be common knowledge that medication is vastly overprescribed and the clinical trials are a joke at best. Listen to me now and thank me later. Ever wonder why the listed side effects are minimal compared to actual side effects of people taking them? Well, just maybe the manufacturer(who also
 is the one testing the drugs) is kind of lying or witholding the truth?! Of course not! Why would they lie? Its not like the drug is going to make millions or billions of dollars anyways...oh wait, yes it is!

6$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/6/2016 7:11:49 AM$Reviewer: China, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years$5$5$5$Lithium is the reason I believe I am still alive.  I had tried committing suicide three times.  I swallowed an entire bottle of tricyclics which should have killed me.  I was so desperate after medications didn't work that I was considering electroshock therapy.  On the third day of taking Lithium I could physically feel something change in my brain.  Like a switch turning on.  My crippling depression is gone as is my urge to die.  I'm not saying I don't struggle day to day but I never even contemplate hurting myself.  I know every medication works differently for different people so I am not saying run out and get it.  But if you are desperate to fight your depression it might be worth asking your doctor about it.

8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/2/2016 12:37:36 PM$Reviewer: Icare4u2, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$1$5$Lithium is a great medication, however, I got a few of the side effects that it says you MAY receive while taking this drug. I first started taking this and felt great within a few days! I then started the hand trembling and then very slowly started to see a change in my vision. I noticed that I would get like quick flashes of light or one eye would go blank. I told my doctor and he removed me from it and put me on something else. I truly love this drug, but if it wasn't for these side effects, I'd be a happy camper.

I shudder to think what life would be like without it. Unfortunately, I'm brand-sensitive. That is, I do not respond to just any brand of the drug that my pharmacy is pushing at the moment. I only respond to Lithobid made by Sandoz. I have picked up some moderate hand trembling as the years have gone by, but other than that, I have no side effects to speak of. I literally owe my life to this drug, since like most of us, I have come to find that there are some things in life that are worse than death.

I have been on it for a month now and up to 1200mg/day. Im still manic in afternoons but not as bad. This drug was highly recommended,but dangerous. Very thirsty, going to bathroom a ton, still depressed, anxious, not sleeping,not eating much. Not feeling too good physically but trying to ride it out. Headaches starting now, this morning feels like migrane coming on. Im also on 150mg Effexor for depression, 180mg Geodon for hallucinations, .5mg 3x day and bedtime for anxiety,300mg Tazadone for sleep. And I am feeling it. Cant work and been hospitalized 3 times in 2 months this year. Is how Im feeling worth side effects, it has to be. I need my life back.

I have suffered from extreme depression since I was a child, and struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction since high school. Although I have tried multiple antidepressants and anti anxiety medications, paired with therapy and 12 step programs nothing seemed to work. This is the first medication I can honestly say has changed my life. This along with the meds I was previously taking, and continuing my work in AA and NA, I feel like a new person. I, like most, did have some side effects when I first started taking it, (tremors, tiredness, weight gain and thirst) but after about a month these subsided. I feel so much better and even the people around me have noticed that I seem more alert and ""here"" as opposed to being depressed and distant. If you struggle with severe depression and are struggling to find the right meds, I strongly recommend talking to your doctor about trying lithium. "

I have bipolar depression type 2. I don't notice any side affects but every person is different. And helped me get through life. been taking it for about 3 years now and I'm 20 years old.

I suffer from hand tremors and even at times full body tremors but only when i dont drink enough water. I have also gained several pounds but i'm told i only look healthier since i was under weight to begin with. My mood is much more stable and i smile and laugh more now than i have in years since i started the lithium treatment. I feel normal in groups of people and not only has it helped my bipolar depression it has also helped massively with anxiety. I do occasionally have a manic episode but usually the manic high not low which i can handle. This medication has improved me as a mother, friend and just helped me to become a normal person again, it feels great. I highly recommend this medication.
16$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/25/2014 3:37:06 PM$Reviewer: misslissa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I took lithium for about 2 years and did very well on it. It helped regulate my moods to an 'almost normal' point, the best I've ever been. There were side effects, however. The worst side effect for me was the thirst/dehydration - and the way I dealt with it. I drank a lot of water because I was always thirsty, but this caused hyponatremia - low salt to water ratio. I would experience painful headaches, vertigo, tingling in my extremities, and more because of it. Now that I know what caused the problems, this time on lithium I will try to drink less pure water and more sports drinks for thirst, and to make sure I sneak some salty foods into my diet. I just started taking lithium again and after 24 hours I already feel so much better. I feel much less depressed and anxious, but I'm not manic either. I've experienced other side effects, too. The most annoying being the tremors in my hand. The shaking usually isn't too bad, but once one of my arms started jerking - reminiscent of a seizure but only in one arm. It lasted about 20 minutes and never recurred.
17$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/2/2014 2:30:37 AM$Reviewer: Mskitty82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have struggled for many years with depression,anxiety,ADHD, and bipolarism and after trying almost every drug out there over many years,we possibly have found a solution. I take 300mg 2x a day, along with 20mg adderal and there is a tremendous difference in the way I behave...for the better. I still struggle with the depression but that's something different I'm not talking about. The main side effect I have experienced is that you DEFINITELY cannot be in the sun for an extended amount of time. I miss 2 or more doses and I start getting really bad with my anger and crying...but everyone suffers some normally. I would definitely recommend this drug :)
18$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/9/2014 7:51:55 PM$Reviewer: Shakara, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$This medication caused my potassium levels to drop so low that I experienced severe muscle spasms in the neck.

Its a miracle drug, if it works, it works amazing! Don't be scared by the side effects list. Most side effects are gone in a month or so, and even then, your not likely to get the exaggerated side effects. 
Some people do have severe side effects, but that can happen with all meds. If it works like it worked for me, its all worth it. Trust me, all others failed or lacked its effectiveness."

Most likely your doctor will omit telling you to drink lots of water!  Also, will not mention that Lithium blands ones emotions and very likely can cause serious kidney damage.  In his excellent book, ""Toxic Psychiatry,"" Psychiatrist Peter Breggan mentions his telling one Bipolar patient  to forget alcohol OR Lithium and just solve his problems!That's what I'm doing. 1)No counting pills, 2)No remembering to drink a lot of water, 3) No blood tests.  AND, instead of seeing a Psychiatrist, I now see a Social Worker. All those Psycho pills cause horrific side reactions.  Just remember prescription pills are ""artificial chemicals!""Also, do google, ""Dr. Dan Fisher, MD"" and visit his site.  Lots of self help articles from recovering WITHOUT psycho drugs to the characteristics of a recovered mental patient.  The stigma of being ""Mentally Ill"" is A+ horrific so I threw ALL having to do with Psychiatry out! and am now retraining for a new career, not majoring in taking pills and wasting time in hour-long appointments answering,""And, how do you feel?' and ""Are You taking your meds?""
Life is SO much better plus I now have a lot more self esteem!...Also, check your medical records. All of a sudden someone inserted into my record that I am Bipolar.  I checked the DSM, Psychiatry Bible, and I'm NOT bipolar as I am never manic and/or hypo-manic!..."

It also causes toxoplasmosis when used outside of the acute care setting, as well as diabetes insipidus, which I have been recently diagnosed with.

27$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/18/2013 2:10:24 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$5$ I hate this medication due to my first experience on it when I was 18yr. It was horrible! I gained a ton of weight, the tremors in my hands were so bad that I couldn't right, I had to keep drinks & stuff at my high school nurses office, I was on the max dose. With that said I am now 30yr & was stable until I got pregnant with my youngest daughter (& last) My NOW Dr. (totally different Dr) tried for over 2yrs to stabilze. After a 4 month manic high my mom & husband had enough & insisted they go with me to a med check. The Dr knew my fear of this medication & my past with it but we'd tried everything my insurance would cover. Most of it being stuff I was on before too. He mentioned Lithium & I bawled. I've been on it 9 almost 10 months & haven't had any of the issues I had before. I've been able to lose weight not gain. I had tremors but they were due to anxiety & have gone away. I have to take water with me everywhere becuase I get very thirsty & if I get a smidge dehydrated I get dizzy & sick. At the start I had sunlight sensitivity but it went away. It's worth taking for my kids to have a mom.

I was trying one drug after another for almost 10 years, and just got more sick and then tried to shoot myself. Luckily the bullets were old, and didn't fire, hence my review. I take 1200mg, (2x 300mg pills at morning an at night), and it changed me completely in three days, and then plateaued out in a week. If you suffer from serious depression and are feeling without hope, really try this! I have gained a lot of weight however, and have hand tremors when my pulse is high, and muscle twitches in my foot when falling asleep. I went from 160lbs to 215lbs in this time period, and that is with a serious diet and daily exercise. I am 6'4"", so everyone just thought I was working out and theyu say I look great. But I have body issues and other fun stuff from my schizophrenia, that I only recently began treatment for (having not realized I had it until I got a Doctor who was pretty sharp). I also take Propranolol (Inderal) and Latuda. The Latuda is only 1.5 months in so I feel pretty positive. There is also cognitive dulling on Lithium, like a mental fog, but NOT like Seroquel! NOTHING like as bad as Seroquel. There is hope, friends, but we are all unique snowflakes and have to constantly work to keep our minds in shape. I only rated it 2 STARS for satisfaction because I hate feeling overweight and having no steady energy, etc etc. Hope this helps! "

It pulled me out of a depression that wanted to leave me crying for no good reason. It is a very wonderful mood stabilizer. So if you need something to work today and not 6 weeks from now I recommend lithium highly but beware of side effects. At the time this was the best thing for me but after awhile the side effects became worse. I gained 25 lb. in just a couple months. After two months I lost so much hair that my hair got so thin it felt like I had got a haircut. The worst thing of all was the restlessness which will keep you uneasy and twitchy the whole time. I'm sure this is dose dependent. I took 1200 mg daily. If you can deal with the fact that lithium might make you fat and  bald then this may be the perfect bipolar medicine.

They have both lost their effect on me and I asked my psychiatrist to switch me to something else.  During this ineffective period, I have made enemies of almost all my family and friends.  I have also had many accidents, a careless fire in my kitchen and other serious mishaps.  I spend too much crying over petty things and an equal amount of time laughing like a fool at various TV shows.  Most of the time I hate myself for getting as fat as I've gotten and being unsuccessful for being overweight for at least 20 years.

    This is really the gold standard for bi-polar and cyclical depression treatment.  My background was to have fairly minor cyclical ""highs"" with some very powerful depressive ""lows"" maybe once a year or so.   My lows were bad enough that I had to drop out of college, where I had been an honor student, and I actually thought I had brain damage.   Anyway, finally discovered lithium as the first drug I tried after finally going to the doctor.   KEY POINT OF LITHIUM FOR ME:  DOSAGE CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE AT A VERY LOW DOSE!!!   My typical dose for 90% of the year is 150 - 300 per day.   Then, for the depressive times, I may go up to 450 - 900, but only for a week or so.   "

But i'v had them since I was a kid.  So i still get kidney infections and thyroid issues, it has nothing to do with the lithium.  Thoses issues are no better or worse then before starting lithium.  I guess it all depends on you, mind and body

Side effects have hit me hard, including thyroid disease, tremors, a tic disorder, and i am fully dependent on it. I also need an antipsychotic to follow though.

It's mutch cheaper than other drugs and I haven't experienced too many side effects, Mostly more frequent urination. I'm on 600 mg a day and can handle the regimine witch includes 1500 mg of Depakote. I'm not so tired all the time my mind is clear and i'm lossing weight (finally) I'm definitevly happier. Being off of abilify is like a weight has been lifted. I hope all this continues. 
50$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/4/2012 5:54:22 PM$Reviewer: Lithium Is Bad, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Lithium is the worst drug ever!!! I have been on a lot of medications over the years and this one is by far the worst! While on this medicine my blood pressure went through the roof, I started having chest pains, it made my eyes bloodshot, gave me headaches, made me dopey and very sick. This medication should be illegal. Even if you can handle the side effects, the long term consequences to your health are not worth it. Lithium is so toxic to your body that your doctor has to monitor your thyroid and kidney function, as this medication ruins both of them along with the rest of your body. LITHIUM IS POISON!!!
51$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/18/2012 6:23:14 PM$Reviewer: tabpdb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$4$I was diagnosed with depression in 2001. Something that took me over 10 years to finally admit to myself that something isn’t right.  Paxil worked well at that time.  I stopped taking this about 2 years ago because of money issues.  I had a break down in May of this year.  My doctor put me back on Paxil.  After 4 weeks of it not kicking in he decided to check me for bipolar.  My counselor and he decided I was bipolar because the Paxil wasn't working.  I was placed on Lithium in June.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE! No more racing thoughts, no more suicidal thoughts, and the ability to smile now.  If I only knew then what I know now.  It feels so great to actually be happy and stop putting on the act of being happy.  I’m still in the early stages of taking this.  My first blood test came back as low lithium in my system.  I see the doctor again in a month.  I highly recommend this to anyone who isn’t sure.  I’ve had no side effects to worry about sometimes a little nausea but besides that the happiness I feel now is worth it.

53$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/5/2012 3:17:20 PM$Reviewer:  (Patient) $1$1$1$Worst medication ever. Effected me socially, sexually, emotionally. I feel this was the worst thing that ever happened to me when I took it. I now learned that lithium stops the estrus cycle in females and in males blocks the production of testosterone. It also interferes with nerve conduction at potassium channels. It can cause horrible effects and Lithium is NOT an essential element like carbon, potassium, or hydrogen. NAC (n-acetylcysteine) is a much more effective alternative for this disorder and is much safer and protects the kidneys. Clinical trials prove NAC's effectiveness. I am also looking into the drug Sodium Polystyrene to remove and leftover lithium in the body. It is used for excessive potassium, but clinical trials have shown that it is effective in reducing lithium in the body, while simultaneously supplementing potassium. Thanks for your time! :) Feel better everyone. Lithium is not always the answer.

It is much more safe, helpful and protective to the kidneys, and effective (proven in clinical research). I hated lithium. I would go so far as to say that when I took it, it destroyed my life. NAC on the other hand, has been a life saver. I have my sex life back and some of my confidence. My disorder is in control too thanks to the NAC. :)

57$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/1/2012 12:36:58 PM$Reviewer: Daisy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$2$My dosage was increased to 1200 mgs and while the depression/mania went away (yay) the side effects kicked in.  Most troubling is the nausea and that awful metal taste.  Haven't read where anyone else has experienced the metal taste though, so that troubles me a bit.  I can deal with the slight hand tremors as that only seems to occur when I'm tired or distracted.  The diarrhea is inconvenient, but getting better.  The hair loss doesn't concern me as I have massive amounts of hair.  The increased thirst kinda sux, but goes hand in hand with the increased trips to the bathroom.  It seems like I have several of the side effects, but nothing I can't deal with.  Lithium actually seems to be working for me.  Abilify made me a zombie, so it feels good to be ME again...with controlled depression and mania.

60$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/6/2012 7:56:11 PM$Reviewer: karen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$3$3$I started this med as an adjunct to my 200mg lamotrigine for suicidal thoughts. Initially I started on 900 mg each night. Nausea didn't subside after 2 weeks so I did 600mg at night and 300 in the morning. This relieved the nausea. I gained 15 pounds and it seems impossible to loose it. Fogginess is a problem. And now, months later a new problem of headache and nausea is plaguing me. How I'm going to work under the side effects of both of these drugs is of great worry to me. LAMOTRIGINE has decimated my memory and makes me feel zombi-ish. Doc says this is better than where I was, a very dark place. I have to agree, but... :/

Some said they had a hard time concentrating while on it and that they felt somewhat slow. I didn't need to be scared at all. It works perfectly. I'm currently taking 1200mg. It took a good 3 months and a half to get to the good dose though. I'm a university student and just made the Dean's list for academic excellence. I do not feel dull or drowsy at all, I am me, the normal me without hypomania or depression. If you're struggling with bipolar disorder, please try it.

I am 45 years old female, have been diagnose as Severe Bipolar,manic depressive,O.C.D And very high strung with anxiety, insomnia. Need I say more. While on Lithium Carb. 300mg 2x a day, I have had 2 miscarriages gained 26 pounds in 3 months ( I did mention im anorexic) and bloated up to look like I was 9 months pregnant instead of 3 months. I have problems now with urinating heavily all the time but always so thirsty. I have been on this drug for 3months....my temper is uncontrollable... I have attacked yes attacked 2 women and 3 men, I had to literally be pulled off these people it took 2 grown people to do it... did I mention I am 5ft 1 inch tall and weighed 115 pds.I dont know if I want to continue this medication...I am at awww with myself, I am sad, disgusted and sick of doctors for not doing more testing before prescribing a list of drugs that they think will hold you for the time being....I must say that everyone in my neighborhood is deathly terrified by me now... so are my grown children, one of which was one of the people I attacked because of a heated argument....I am sick to know this is the drug that has created this monster known as me now.... I would rather smoke reefer and stay high 24/7 and laugh at the world in harmony than continue down this road of life on lithium, unfortunately reefer is not affordable and isnt legal here yet,good-luck to those who it helps....but heed to caution while taking it you DO NOT see what others see come out of you on this medication.....it can be a nightmare. thank you. 
63$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/7/2012 1:16:31 PM$Reviewer: cyndifb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I feel it is wrong to tell anothernot to take this med. I have been on 450mg per day for over 1 year, I also take generic xanax and Ambien CR. I attempted suicide twice in 2010, that was when I was diagnosed with Bipolar and depression. I was first on Depakote, it worked ok, then changed to Seroquil (was the best but to expensive) then put on Lithium. I have had no problems with it, that does not mean I won't in the future as we all know you become used to the med and it can become ineffective. but like all meds it depends on the person as to how and if it works. so do what your Doctor says and if you experience any side effects get to the Doctor.

Now I have low thyroid level.  They want me to take another pill for that.  I weaned down my dose from Dec to Feb since I wasn't feeling good physically.  Stiff joints, no energy, frequent urination, swollen ankles, dry mouth and especially BELLY BLOAT (that developed last few months)-I felt 8 months pregnant and looked it too!!  The thyroid problem just turned up today because I was so exhausted suffering with bronchitis I thought but my family dr checked the thyroid blood level.  So now I want to know if I change off lithium will my thyroid level go back to normal? or is this another pill I will have to take all my life??  I called 2 pharmacies and talked to my dr's nurse and none of them can tell me if this is reversible.  You would think someone could help.  I will be getting off the lithium onto something else next week when I see my dr.  Glad to know there are others out there.

I've been on every anti-depressant that you can think of--since I was 17, for my deep, dark depression.  I've also been on Xanax, Lorazapam, Clolonapin, etc.  to slow me down a bit. A lot of hits and misses through the years.  In my 20's and 30's Prozac and a bit of Xanax did the trick.  But after a while those meds no longer worked for me.  When I was 44 the doc diagnosed me with Bi-Polar.  I can lose my temper very quickly.  I get instant headaches, my blood pressure rises and I   say mean things that I regret immediatly, and I can't stop myself.  I can also get violent.  I'm crying and being very sorry to who my target was at the time within the next 15 minutes to a half an hour after my tempertantrum.  Then my depression is right out front again.  It's always there never letting up.  The thoughts in my mind are so dark, hopeless and very sad. Then the Doc put me on 120mg of Cymbalta and 1200mg of lithium.  Man I felt great.  I don't remember ever feeling light and happy.  I wasn't having dark thoughts.  I'd actually get out of bed and do my mom duties.  And I actually would leave my comforts of home and enjoy the outdoors.  But then the side effects started...vomiting, nausea, diarrea, off balance and slurring of words.  My blood test showed that I was toxic.  So now I'm on 600mg a day and I'm back to anger,hopelessness, and very sad and a bit suicidal.  I guess I need to be patient and hopefully find the right level of Lithium my body needs.  I have to stick with this.  I need to think positive.  I hope all this gabbing has helped someone out there...best wishes

The doctor brushed all this off, telling me it was caused by the depression. So they refused to change the medication; they piled other medications on top.  The other medications made the moderate fatigue severe.  The doctor also did not inform me about the health risks linked with the drug.

It was a nightmare! Any side effect that you could possibly get from these meds, i got! from lactating breasts to wetting the bed (resperdal) to massive weight gain and the interference of my thyroid medication absorption, the doctors didn't know that lithium blocks thebody from getting any synthroid, so needless to say my thyroid isn't doing so hot these days, thanks doc! lithium was the worst, it made me gain an excessive amount of weight during the time i ws taking it.  am 5'3"" and normally weigh between 125-127 lbs, while i was on lithium and all the rest i BALLOONED  to a WHOPPING 298lbs!!!!!!! at that point the lithium was useless because the weight gain was counter-productive towhat all these meds wer trying to accomplish. i was more depressed, more anxious, going anywhere out of my house looking like that for me was horrifying!
So i quickly stopped all my meds and the weight came off me within a month!!! i will never touch lithium or those other drugs again!!! i am trying to find a medication to help me with my bipolar that won't interfere with my thyroid hormone and won't make me gain THAT MUCH weight !"

I am in the process of working with a neurologist and my psychiatrist about pseudotumor cerebri.  I've been on lithium since April 2010, went to a routine eye exam in October where they noticed my optic nerves swollen.  I had to go to 2 different eye specialist then finally a neurologist.  They did a lumbar puncture to confirm pseudotumor cerebri.  The neurologist wanted me to take diamox which made me super sick.  Finally I am getting off the lithium to see if that is really causing all the issues.  Also all my joints feel super stiff and my ankles are swollen.  Lithium has worked awesome for my moods though.

I started Lamictal a good 6 years ago and that was a miracle to begin with then added Lithium to it 3 years ago and it was a perfect match.  

I have tried Abilify-hallucinations, Wellbutrin-a seizure, after months of taking it, and so many more A-Z meds that made me crazy. I despise waking up every morning knowing I have to take my meds and what have you, but I could not imagine my life without it ever again.  

It took 9 years of hell on earth for docs to discover that I was chemically imbalanced. I am one out of the few who began symptoms at the age of 12. Fist fights, mental hospitalizations, etc. were kicking high then and progressing. May I add, I was always the preppy girl that no one assumed anything from. 

Since discovery I have participated in a bipolar research study voluntarily, as if I would ask for anything, at an exquisite hospital. It was a for a year and am proud to say that I was the first to successfully finish the study. This regarded weekly meetings, evaluations, tests, homework. All I wished and had ever hoped for was to contribute something/anything from my illness so no other child has to go through what I did. I went under that study during a time where I was depressed, mania wasn't so bad. I have also donated towards the cause and etc. 

But all around, I can truly say,  Lithium and Lamictal changed my life. I understand not everyone will benefit from lithium but I hope people find their way. Bipolar Disorder is a constant battle and I still get down, very down, but I won't back down. Best.   "

I prefer the extended release formula because it keeps me more level, but I cannot afford it at this time.  Prior to being prescribed this medication, I had a very negative impression of it.  Others I had known who had used it claimed that they felt ""in a fog"".  This is not true for me, perhaps because I ""live"" in the depressive phase of the disorder and did not experience a loss of ""energy"" (i.e., mania).  I am Bipolar II, and rarely have extended manic episodes.  My mania expresses itself in brief but intense episodes of rage.  Lithium has greatly reduced the number and severity of those episodes.  To be sure, I still get disproportionately angry about everyday situations, but that is likely due to lingering, unresolved psychological issues.  I would encourage anyone to whom lithium has been recommended to at least give it a try.  It is one of the few psychiatric drugs whose need and effects can be physiologically established and tracked by blood test to determine lithium levels.  (Sigh, if only the same could be done for anti-depressants.)"

So far it has been the best medication I have taken. Still, like with all medications I am a little concerned with the long term side effects, but I know if I do not take it, the immediate effects are awful and scary. Before taking Lithium I was in a very lonely and dark place where I do not want to go back. I am pretty happy with the results of this medication.

My moods have stabilised very well. The only real problem I have with it is nausea and vomiting 1-3 hours after taking it. I deal with this by taking it last thing at night and sleeping through the side effects, although sometimes it wakes me up. I always have something small to eat with it too, and I have to keep my fluids up through the day to prevent dry mouth and a return of nausea. All worth it tho' to be rid of the lurching mood swings and pretty constant suicidal thoughts. And the regular blood testing picked up diabetes before I had any symptoms so that was a bonus!

So far this has been a life changing drug for me. Literally I thought I was going to kill myself and just hadn't picked the right method. I ended up at a State facility where the Doctor there put me on Lithium and a couple other drugs.  As of today, I no longer plot my death and it is actually worrying me that I'm not because I did it for so many years.  Then I find myself giving thanks to God...and the Dr. I havent felt this ""normal"" since I was 14y/o, I'm now 32. I'm not trying to promote Lithium for anyone else because I was scared to take it because of all the horror stories. But it's worked literal miricles in all aspects of my life and hope it continues for years to come.  By the way I have had some side affects; mild tremors, dry mouth and some stomach issues, but if it's that or depression or suicide, I'll take the side affects.  Good Luck everyone"

My sex drive is back, and I have alot more energy during the day and night. I always have to drink, if I dont my mouth gets dry, and feel gassy. I still have tremors whenever my heart rate goes up, or if im hungry. Im still getting used to the fact that Im Bipolor, but I see that im still very independent, strong minded, and still have the wonderful part of my bubbly/diva personality. So to people who are Bipolor I want to let you know, that you are just you. You have special spice in your personality when your not depressed, and we have strong minds when we are on the right meds, and we can probaly handle more than other people. I think. I hope it dosent only apply to me. Anyways, it feels good to share all of this. Be strong everyone!!!

By 6:30 am the morning after my first bedtime dose I had developed these symptoms: severe nausea, vomiting, and spasmodic diarrhea; chills and sweats; stomachache with cramping and very strong burning sensation from diaphragm to pelvis; intense body ache; strong contractions in muscles of legs, arms, and back that I was unable to stop by conscious efforts to relax individual muscles; intermittent low-grade fever; fine tremor; frequent short bursts of violent shaking / shivering.  I felt agitated and I could not concentrate.  I was clumsy and unsteady on my feet.  Light-headedness developed later in the day.  I was able to sleep only in brief (one-to-two hour) naps; the pain, agitation, muscle tension, and other symptoms kept me awake for about 18 hours of the 24-hour day.  I could not keep anything in my stomach.  On two days I had to go to Urgent Care for IV fluids and pain relief.  Emotionally, I felt very, very depressed.  (Ironic, that.)  After four days I stopped taking the lithium.  Symptoms began to subside slowly, with the nausea and vomiting passing off first.  At the first of December I am still having trouble with agitation, fatigue, clumsiness, and the need to stick to a bland diet.  My pharmacist says that the only way to determine if I had an adverse drug reaction is to re-challenge.  I would rather backpack on mid-summer's day through seven layers of the Inferno than let this stuff pass my lips again.  A complicating factor is that I am sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate, an ingredient in some toothpastes.  If I use these toothpastes I get canker sores.  Sodium lauryl sulfate (also called sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS, and other names) is listed by Roxane Labs as an ""Inactive Ingredient"" in its generic lithium formulation.  Inactive, my foot.  I call for FDA reform: it is wrong to list such an ingredient as ""inactive."""

I've been on Lithobid two different times (I discontinued it when pregnant and started again post partum). The first time, my therapeutic dose made me feel numb, but better than I was prior to when it was prescribed to me. The dosage was somewhat high. Currently, the second time around, my Lithobid dose was cut in half and another medication accompanied it (Wellbutrin SR). Thus far, I'm in a better realm of mind, but not as peaceful as I once remembered when I was on a stronger Lithobid dose. I still get depressed, but I dont get manic anymore. I'm hoping to discuss the difference with my doctor. Overall, Lithobid can be daunting considering the ingredients, side effects, etc. ; however, it certainly helped

I have a milder form of Bipolar called Cyclothymic Disease. It has been very helpful in controlling by manic episodes.  I have not had a depressive episode in over two years which in the past I have taken imipramine(an older medication).  I have only taken the latter when I feel a depressive episode coming on.  I am a professional and cannot tolerate the tremor that the severe imipramine causes with the lithium to perform my duties as a dentist so I have been taking over the years propranolol(10 mg.) which erases the ""shaking"".  Only side  effects that I have had besides the tremors are thirst, fluid intake and of course voiding quite often.  I can handle those though. 

In closing I would say it has been very helpful and on a number of occasions before I began the lithium suicide was certainly an alternative."

I still want to stay home all the time and whenever I do manage to go out I have to fight back tears. I don't know if maybe it's to soon for it to work properly or if it's just not working for me.
205$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/9/2008 4:31:23 PM$Reviewer: angelprincess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$At first i refused to take the lithium. But after many more thoughts of sucide and fights with my husband i decided to give it another chance. After the side affects went away, about a week, i started to feel some what normal. It makes me sleepy so i take 300mg at night. I've only been on it regularly for about three months now. I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm also on prozac which has helped alot!!!
206$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/3/2008 4:08:57 PM$Reviewer: Bored, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$5$"-Currently taking 600mg. Even at a low dosage of 300mg I experienced ""finger twitching"". I'm sorta wondering what's gonna happen with my next increase.
-I see myself as mechanical these days. I wake up, go to work (most of the time), and sleep. 
-Apathetic may be a better term. I only do what is necessary. I hardly hang out with my friends anymore. I don't have any interests anymore. But I have a new found appreciation for my TV.
-I seem to be in an emotional fog. There are no low's or high's; just the mediocre, repetitious, and boring. I guess this may be a positive outcome for some.  Prior to taking this drug I was/am taking 2mg Risperdal, 200mg Lamictal, and 20mg Valium."

Lasts for up to 1 minute. It's hard to tell though since I take so many other medications: Lamictal, Geodon, Cymbalta, Remeron, and Xanax. Does anyone else experience these symptoms with Lithium

211$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/28/2008 2:17:59 AM$Reviewer: BigBlackF350, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$3$I was diagnosed in December of 08 with bipolar after being treated for classic depression for 15 years with really no relief.This is the first drug my doc gave me for treatment. Yes there are some side effects that are not so desireable but geeze they are liveable side effects. The only issue I have with this med is that I am supposed to take it 3 times a day and that is just a pain to get in that dose in the middle of the day. Besides the middle of the day dose hurts my stomach and makes me sleepy. However I am able to sleep at night now, my brain is not constantly wandering, I'm not freaking out over stupid little stuff, and I do not feel depressed in the least. I really would recommend this med to others. But what I think others need to keep in mind there is no drug in this world that can help every single person. We all have sensitivities to certain things.

I highly recamend these two drugs for anyone...
213$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/12/2008 8:08:19 PM$Reviewer: maggie, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$3$"Lithium is a bit like a buffer, in that it evens out any emotion you might happen to feel (manic or otherwise). It lessens the severity of everything. Also, after a while you become pretty boring to hang out with. You start staring at walls and watching Garden State with new found insight. Its not too bad though, like being in a perpetual fog, and then one day noticing ""hey, my hands are shaking."" Then again 1200mg will do that to you. With proper dosing it is effective for controlling the impulsive. "
214$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/1/2008 4:00:39 PM$Reviewer: DISKY,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$5$"I'm glad to see so many people have had a positive experience with this drug. However, my 16 year old bipolar son, was given this drug & within 2 weeks of starting the med he developed one of the worst cases of cystic acne we have ever seen including his dr. He is virtually disfigured! Even after stopping the med the acne did not stop. Prior to the introduction of Lithium he had a usual pimple here or there[nothing big]. Virtually, overnight he looked like his face had caught on FIRE! I took him to the ER where they dx him with impentago!UGH!!! His Psych dr. gave him antibiotics that didnot help. On to the dermatologist. He seen 2, they end result with that was ""We did all we can do w/ injections & meds & washes, look into ""other skin therapies"" plastic surgery,as the cysts [keloid-type] are so large and dark pink that they cover his entire shoulder area, most of his back & chest & his beautiful face. It's still beautiful to me!  Needless, to say this has caused him to become a ""hermit,"" as he won't leave the house,no school, no job, no life! The emotional scars are as bad [maybe worse] as the scars/acne on his skin. I don't blame the dr.{completely} as I know you never know how a person's body will react to a med. My son on the other hand certainly doesen't feel the same way! We can't afford plastic surgery (as he is no longer our medical insurance due to his age)& no one can guarantee that he'll look any better after. My aim is NOT to scare anyone I WANT ONLY TO WARN ANYONE WHO IS GIVEN THIS OR ANY MED TO BE ACUTELY AWARE OF ANY SIDE-EFFECTS YOU MAY HAVE - WHEATHER THE DR. EXPLAINS THEM OR NOT! We were only told after the breakouts started that there is always a ""chance"" especially in adolecent ""boys"" that this type of side-effect could happen,but the dr. had never seen it to the degree my son has had to suffer with.  PLEASE BE AWARE OF YOUR OWN FEELINGS WITH NEW MEDS OR PARENTS KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON YOUR CHILD FOR ANYTHING UNUSUAL -- I PRAY FOR GOOD HEALTH FOR ALL."
215$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/10/2008 3:29:25 PM$Reviewer: wvugirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$This medication has done wonders for my depression. I was a mess and it did not kick me into a manic tailspin. But the side effects are what's killing me. I am having the severe dry mouth and the frequent urination. I am not having the weight gain, because I can't eat. I am sick at my tummy all the time. I am sick from the time I get up until the time I go to bed and then some. I have the hand tremors and I stay cold. Especially my feet. I get headaches too. But let me tell you, I would much rather put up with all these side effect than go back into that deep dark hole of depression I was in. I don't ever want to go back there.

It restored my ability to function and at maintenance levels continues to keep my bipolar disorder out of the way of my life. Side effects are dosage related. Maintenance levels can be much lower than those needed for initial stability. Lithium is a naturally-occurring mineral that everyone has in their body.  It is cheap and can be used for a lifetime. Drinking water is a must.

I have been on lithium for a couple years now.  I gained about 15 pounds, I'm always thirsty and always urinating. But I am pretty mentally stable right now and it has been an overall satisfactory experience.
