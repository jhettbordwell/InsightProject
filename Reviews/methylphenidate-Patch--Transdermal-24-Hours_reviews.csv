I take three 10mg tablets daily in the morning. I really helped with lack of concentration. But I discovered if I took it late in the day because I forgot to take it when I woke up, I had a lot of trouble sleeping.
3$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/1/2009 2:08:25 PM$Reviewer:  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$They put my 6 year old son on the patch 15mg and on the first day he was acting like he was high and couldn't focus on any thing. The Dr. said that it was to much for his body the fist time and so he changed him to 5 mg. ritlin . We will see how this does.

If they could just come up with a glue that did not cause such a bad rash.  I am concerned about the long term effects of having him on such a medicine.
