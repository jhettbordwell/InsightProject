1$Condition: Depression$6/18/2015 6:19:35 PM$Reviewer: JonathanT, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I had been on 450 mg Wellbutrin daily for years with so-so results.  My doc gave me a 30 day supply of 522 mg Aplenzin to try and it was as if someone turned the lights on.  After only ONE day I noticed an immediate feeling of well-being that was bordering on euphoria without having to worry about the crash & burn.  Although I am unable to take a daytime nap, I have no trouble sleeping at night.   I am worried about the price - when I started it cost $1500/month and now it is almost $3000/month... this seems very high, but then again, nothing has ever worked as well as Aplenzin.   I am afraid that my insurance company will decide that it is not worth the cost to have one of their patients feeling so good.  While my sex drive is hampered a bit (but I also have low-T) and I may have put on a few extra pounds, I hardly consider those side effects troublesome enough to stop the Aplenzin.  This is truly a miracle drug."

It is a high-grade amphetamine. Don't let any doctor lie to you about it. I took it 5 years and have been off it 3 years, taken off this poison by a nonAmerican doctor who doesn't buy into the ""give-a-pill"" theory of medicine. Wellbutrin has changed my brain permanently. I was never angry before. Now I live every day very angry. My life is hell filled with anger. This medication is poison. Please, don't do this to your life and your brain. Run very far. I would give anything not to have taken this poison. I'm very sure my Medicare paid for the mags on my first doctor's Porsche. Eat right and exercise. Do not surrender to the ""medicines"" Rx companies give you. They don't care what it does to your brain. They only care about their profits. PLEASE, PLEASE take this seriously. Or you will be awakening every morning irrationally filled with hate and anger when you never were before. That's where I'm at now. I don't know when it will end. If ever."

5$Condition: Depression$3/2/2012 11:01:12 PM$Reviewer: klinkaz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I switched from Prozac to this drug a little over a year ago.  I was on Prozac for about 10 years, but wasn't happy with the lack of libido.  I have been taking 174 mg of Aplenzin 4 days a week and 348mg three days a week for a little over a year now. I have never felt better.  Unfortunately, I think it's causing severe acne. About 3 months after I started taking it, I started getting terrible breakouts.  I'm 32 and have never had acne problems.  I have spent the last year battling cystic acne and literally trying every single treatment/remedy I can think of.  All my hormone levels are normal, so I know that isn't the cause.  I've started analyzing all my supplements and medications to see if there is a link.  I'm just realizing that Aplenzin may be the primary cause (given the timeline).  Unfortunately, I haven't seen it listed among the side effects and was curious if I'm the only one having this problem.  possible.
6$Condition: Depression$2/7/2012 6:24:59 PM$Reviewer: DWMAH, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$Went over to this from Lexapro due to Lexapro side effects getting worse over time.  So far so good only one month, generally feel better, more energy, less appetite, no mood swings.

10$Condition: Depression$11/19/2010 2:04:23 AM$Reviewer: jennerationb, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I've been on different anti-depressants for about 10 years now. I had recently been on Effexor XR but noticed weight gain and constant trembling in my hands.  I switched over to Aplezin about 1 month ago and it's been great. I feel happier than I have in a long time, and I now have to remind myself to eat because I have little to no appetite.
11$Condition: Depression$8/16/2010 2:40:36 PM$Reviewer: Ready2GetBetter, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$I took this medicine as a substitute for generic Wellbutrin when I was in between insurance coverage.  It seems to work fine for the depression, just a nagging side effect of a bit of dizziness when I move my head suddenly in bed.  This seems to be worse in the mornings and evenings, it doesn't bother me during usually during the day at all.
12$Condition: Depression$8/2/2010 5:44:42 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$4$I had been taking Wellbutrin for about 9 yrs., worked for awhile , kept increasing the mg. until i needed higher dosage.  Began Aplenzin last year. This med. alone is not really helping my depression symptoms. I'm becoming frustated, more anxiety, because my depression just seems to becoming worse.  When I was taking 1 pill at 522 mg. seemed to work well for most of the day, not everyday, then began taking 2 pills at 174 and 358, for some strange reason the 2 pills that added up to 522 mg. wasn't working the same way as 1 pill 522 mg. This med. has became very expensive and I cannot continue, unless my doc. continues to give me samples of Aplenzin.  I may have to switch to something else. So far, have not been able to handle side effects from the other antidepressents I've tried in the past. 
13$Condition: Depression$6/29/2010 2:27:28 PM$Reviewer: jenniferellen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I am on 512mg of Aplenzin which my dr says is equivalent to 450mg of Wellbutrin XR. I have been on this for about a year progressing to the current dosage that I am on. I think this medication has significantly helped me feel motivated and helped me to see my life more with the glass half full :) I know that it is working because when I ran out of my meds a couple months ago my boyfriend asked me why I was being so snippy with him and instigating problems between us. In a later conversation I mentioned I hadn't been taking my meds for a few days and he told me that he indeed could tell a huge difference in me. Thats all the confirmation of success that i need! :)
14$Condition: Depression$5/11/2010 6:02:29 PM$Reviewer: pnwrighteous, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I'm 45 and have had major clinical depression/anxiety and panic disorder for 20 + years. I was on cymbalta and wellbutrin. Since Wellbutrin is such a great drug I wanted to increase it because the side effects are little to nothing.  So this is my 5th day of taking Aplenzin. And so far it's a great drug. 
15$Condition: Depression$5/10/2010 3:56:29 PM$Reviewer: JoJo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Bupropion was not effective in treating my depression while Aplenzin seems to be more effective
16$Condition: Depression$4/24/2010 10:32:37 PM$Reviewer: exhausted, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$2 days ago I stopped Pristiq due to side effects and got on the Aplenzin.  So far no side effects.  I have high hopes.
17$Condition: Depression$3/30/2010 1:19:32 PM$Reviewer: Sandy792, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$"I have panic disorder which subsequently caused me to fall into a deep state of depression.  At first my phychiatrist prescribed me Wellbutrin SR (taken twice daily) and Zoloft.  After about 3 months I actually had moments where I was starting to feel happy to be alive.  However, the Zoloft was causing my libido to practically be non existant.  At my next visit with my psych suggested that I begin taking Aplenzin 348 mg because it only needs to be taken once a day. 

After about three months I was still not feeling any better so he up-ed my dosage to 522mg and put me on Buspar for anxiety.  It has been just about two months since then and I am feeling worse almost to the point of having suicidal thoughts (I would never kill myself, but the thoughts are greatly disturbing).  My anxiety has gotten worse and I cannot make it through the day without a Xanax. 

I just spoke to my pharmacist who said that I have been patient enough and the 522 mg should have worked by now.  She told me to contact my doc and have him switch me to something else. 

On the postive side, I had not a single side effect on the Aplenzin and it was a very smooth drug.  Unfortunately it did not work for me.  I guess my point is that everyone's body chemistry is different.  I am going to suffer this out for the next three weeks until my next appointment with my psych and am going to ask him to put me on Lexapro for both my anxiety and depression.

20$Condition: Depression$1/17/2010 12:36:54 AM$Reviewer: Beatnick, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$"I was on Buproprion for over 10 years. My depression was getting worse so my doc put me on Cymbalta 60mg and switched me to Aplenzin 522mg from Buproprion. I'm not sure if it's working yet, because it's only been about two weeks. I'm still severly depressed and frequently suicidal. I haven't been able to work or function very well. I just want to sleep all the time. My insurance doesn't cover Aplenzin. When I called my pharmacy they told me it would cost over $800 per month. I was only given one month of samples. I have no idea what I'll do when I run out. Hopefully my doc will either give me another 30 day supply or get a medical necessity exemption from my insurance company. I'm frustrated because nothing seems to be working well any more. I hope the Cymbalta and Aplenzin kick in soon. I don't know how much more of this I can take."
21$Condition: Depression$12/31/2009 7:42:15 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$I've only been on the medication for two days, but Ive been on Wellbrutrin 150 mgs for about four months. I was still having relapses on 150 MG of Wellbrutrin and Pristiq. So the doctor changed medications to Alplenzin 348 MG. So far, Ive been feeling well, a little tired. During the day, I find it a little hard to concentrate, but that could be the change in medication. I am very hopeful about the medication. The tiredness should wear off in a few days.
22$Condition: Depression$11/22/2009 11:13:03 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$My psychiatrist gave me samples of this med because I lost my health insurance and even generic buproprion is expensive for me. He gave me this med as a replacement for my buproprion since he could give me samples at no cost to me. I was on this med for a few months. Buproprion has always worked very well for me consistently through the years. I feel I did a little better on this than the high dose of buproprion I had been on. I did not have any untoward side effects with this med. 
23$Condition: Depression$10/12/2009 10:36:56 PM$Reviewer: flarez, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$1$"I've been taking this for about one month.  At first, I was very lightheaded/dizzy and had some weakness/trembling in my hands. I also experienced an increase in urination.  The most uncomfortable side effect is a tremendous increase in sweating and ""flushing.""  I'm taking HRT to ward off hot flashes but this drug is making them even worse. I'm thinking about going off this drug because of this side effect."
24$Condition: Depression$10/6/2009 6:03:04 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$"I've been on this prescription for about a week and a half now. Switched over from bupropion sr. & effexor at the same time. Coming off effexor and surprising not 1 side effect.  effexor was decreasing my libido and not sure if coming off effexor or going on aplenzin (or both) but my libido is coming back and the depression has lifted for the most part.  Hoping that it only gets better ~ Surprised at how quick this is working.  Effexor worked for me last year, but not at all this year.  cost between effexor and aplenzin are about the same with my insurance. Had a little nausea the first 3 days but that's it.  I have the energy that i got off the wellbutrin.  So I'd reccommend this.

Good luck to all "
25$Condition: Depression$10/2/2009 11:15:59 AM$Reviewer: dizzy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I had been on different medications for years and was put on Aplenzin.  I took the first pill on Tuesday morning and was filling slightly sick that evening which I attributed to switching medications.  Wednesday morning I woke up feeling dizzy and had to sit down while trying to get ready for work.  I actually took a motion sickness pill mid-morning and one mid-afternoon just to be able to function at work.  Any sudden movements would make my head spin and I'd have to sit down, and my tongue swelled and I had several mouth sores develope.  Again I attributed it to switching medications.  Thursday I woke up to the same symptoms so I didn't take Aplenzin that morning and called the doctors office.  I was told it was probably an allergic reaction and I should stop the medication.  I have never had this type of reaction to any other depression medication.
26$Condition: Depression$9/2/2009 9:52:32 PM$Reviewer: suzan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$This drug is fairly new to me. I have only had experience with one other antidepressant before Aplenzin unsuccessfully. This has not truly assisted my level of anxiety, but has given me an overall feeling of well being and has diminished emotional reactions to troubling aspects of my environment.  It has been successful at stabilizing me to previous normality.
