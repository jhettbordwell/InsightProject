0$Condition: Excessive Sweating$10/6/2019 5:00:37 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$1$4$I like that it helps with excessive sweating, but I haven't felt the same. I have been having realistic nightmares,my hair falling out more than usual,and I have been having peeing trouble since starting this drug. I either am having to pee constantly o or I feel like I can't clear out my bladder. Or other times all of a sudden I have to go and I sometimes feel like I can't hold it til I get to a bathroom. I have been tired and my legs feel like heavy lead trying get around I have to sit, because I'm tired. I have been sleeping late in morning and still want to stay in bed for more sleep.

Amen.

I decided to read the warnings at a later date because I'm smart like that. The list of drugs that might end bad if mixed, I take the whole list, daily as a cocktail in one swallow including Clonidine. I also smoke legal marijuana everyday. I never once got dizzy, felt drowsy, or got some added hours of extra sleep. 

How is it possible?

Listen to what your doctor and pharmacist tells you. My doctor told me taking this medication with all my other pills will be fine. No issues.
He was 100% correct. Had I have researched this medication before taking it, I probably wouldn't have even bothered with it.

Online warnings with the detailed info behind your prescriptions are only listed to cover their butts from being sued. Basically, these warnings could be for 1 out of 100,000 people for all we know. It's much better to avoid researching your medication online, unless absolutely necessary and last resort. For most people, it is easy to mentally create negative effects due to simply reading all the bad stuff. Thus damaging your medications true intent.

Instead, visit a hospital, doctor, or walk into your local pharmacy if health care isn't free. They will all help you.

Doctors usually know their medications. They are usually way smarter than you and I. If you have a bad Doctor, simply get a new one. A good doctor will tell you what you need to know before giving you a prescription, and the pharmacist should touch base with these things as well.

Don't let the warnings of this medication listed online scare you away from its awesomeness.

TRUST YOUR DOCTOR. CLONIDINE IS GOOD."

3$Condition: Other$9/16/2019 4:15:57 PM$Reviewer: turtles, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$Doctor prescribed this for my anxiety disorder. I'm surprised to see not many people take it for that. I've done very well on it, therapist says she rarely sees people do so well on meds. right now I take 0.2mg nightly, might go up to 0.3mg. as for side effects I've experienced drowsiness (especially because I also take certizine for allergies) but this has been beneficial for me because I'm now sleeping much better. I also have dry eyes but not very bad. I've never gotten dry mouth from them. I was a bit worried about trying meds but this has seriously improved my life overall, I still experience more anxiety than most people but there are so many things I can do now that I would've never done before

5$Condition: High Blood Pressure$2/1/2019 2:32:34 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Best BP med I've had. Very effective at keeping blood pressure levels in check, which is very important, since I only have one kidney.  I think it might cause a little tiredness, but I take it early before I wake for the day and 12 hours later in the eve -- so it's not a problem.
6$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/2/2019 2:47:12 AM$Reviewer: Max, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$1$"I am an adult with ADHD, PTSD, and High functioning ASD. Clonidine does drastic wonders for my focus, impulsivity, and anger/emotional reactivity. 
For a while though I've noticed that depending on the day when it kicks in I will start sobbing uncontrollably. It doesn't happen every time and it generally stops on a dime. It's frustrating and upsetting and I'm not sure why this happens. 
I know folx on the spectrum can have more intense side effects/reactions to CNS medications and I'm wondering if that's related? I noticed a couple people have similar experiences with their kids. I'd love to know if anyone's had any luck managing that side effect or figuring out why it happens. 
It's especially frustrating because it works so well otherwise."

I've tried other medications only to get horrible side effects.  I highly recommend Clonidine.  It does make you tired when first taking it but once your body adjusts, it's fine.  Plus it also helps with hot flashes and excessive sweating - For me, that's an added bonus!

I have CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome) with a pain pump implanted which administers morphine. The sweats are bad, go through 4-5 changes a day. I was hoping this would help but NOT one bit. After 1 week of use of	CLONIDINE HCL 0.1MG TAB I broke out with a rash (hives?) on my arms, chest and shoulders. Stopping use as I'm ready to rip my skin off the itching and burning is so painful. I will take sweating over this!

Experienced dry mouth, terrible nightmares, bad attitude. Backed off all blood pressure meds (with help from Doctor) One 0.10 mg Clonidine in the morning only helped maintain pressures at 145/70/70. Stopped Clonidine started Cardizem 120 mg 2x per day as an alternative to Clonidine. Only have a few days history but so far ok. Pressures still at 140/70/70. I have been taking blood pressure meds for 40 years and am convinced the less meds you can get by on the better you are.

I combat the reflux with a pill called:  Apple Cider Vinegar.  This keeps the acid down and allows me to sleep like I should.  Remember I am only taking Clonidine 2x a day @ .01mgs.

Also, going through menopause. Already taking 2 BP meds and 1 anti-anxiety med, but BP still high at the doctor or hospital or certain situations like a spousal argument. So far, this med works for high-stress situations. Not tested yet at the dr whom I'm seeing again this summer, so we will see if this med also works.

I don't have any side effects at all. Been taking it for about 25 years. Before clonidine I was taking Hadol which was useless, it made me sleep 24/7, where clonidine works like a charm. I can function in public or by myself without any symptoms of tourettes. Stay with what works, a person knows their body and what is best for them. This is how I feel. Good luck to you.

But found that I was tired and assumed it was low blood pressure as I did not have high blood pressure. I also noticed I had pain in my joints and blurred vision, had very strange vivid nightmares.  Then I started getting hives, and my skin itched so badly under the patch that it felt like it was on fire. So I made an appointment and told my NP about the skin reaction.  We decided to try pill form.  Not the best idea. After a couple of days I had a severe allergic reaction. In dealing with the allergy I found that all the other issues I had were side effects of the clonidine.  Luckily I did not have difficulty breathing, but my face swelled horribly.  I just happen to be allergic to it.  I am sure it can be a wonder drug for people who are not.

Additionally I was receiving daily decreasing amounts of Klonopin, ibuprofen, and pepto bismal. I think the Clonidine and Klonopin had tremendously helped me feel better. I still had the normal withdrawl symptoms, but atleast I was able to get a couple hours of SLEEP a night and didn't just roll around restlessly the whole time. The only issue was since this is also used for high blood pressure, they wouldn't give it to me when my blood pressure was too low. This could be because I was hardly able to eat or drink anything and from hardly moving around.

My choice to get off the pathces as they have sticking issues and made me groggy at the worst time s[down the beach etc :) ] I find the clondine would help me sleep for about 3 hours but then wore off, I also found that after 7 days I had to double the dose to get the same effect. I found it worked better during the day as would stop my eyes running and I would only have to stretch a bit = cam eand went but made things more tolerable. I'd rather have it if nothing else = but this is an ethical issue in my opinion as the only reason I needed it as the Doctor believes no one gets pain relief from opiates and we should live with the pain. Apparently the climate in South OZ is that they dont care about relieving pain, they want to see improved functionality. Stay Away from Willunga Medical Center =RhyLyn

BP still spikes when working moderate workout on treadmill.  Constipation solved with Magnesium Supplement which also eliminated evening cramps in my legs.  Wake up with heavy legs until I have walked around a bit.  Had to reduce to .05mg three times a day as side effects with .1mg tablet somewhat severe.  Dreams are vivid and sometimes bothersome. This is medicine of last resort as I am alergic to other types of meds.  I still have random jumps in BP to over 220/110 which can last for an hour to a few days.  The clonidine helps to reduce these jumps to less than 170/85. I have been checked for pheochomocytoma and found negative.

(Normally I use Valium or sometimes herbal sedatives). The side effects of clonidine are very anti-productive. Case in point: I can take Valium & still move about freely, plenty of energy to work on my job. But clonidine? A big No. Clonidine sucks all energy & motivation out of me, makes me feel like I have iron-deficiency anemia. Recently a co-worker remarked, ""my god... your eyes...they look DEAD,"" after I'd taken a prescribed dose of clonidine. The sapping-of-energy is *that* noticeable to others. Not good while on the job. The side effects just ain't worth it. Skip it, if you can."

Clonidine just makes both of that worse. It's my *last choice* for opiate withdrawal. Ok, what clonidine will do is: alleviate restlesness & perhaps force you to rest if you're about to go crazy, but that's about all. I eventually found that having clonidine around *as a backup/adjunct to other w.d. aids* is more reliable. One example, kratom (a legal herbal opioid), totally reverses the mental depression & lack of energy - that's important when you've got a good job to keep. A Valium or two, here & there, maybe a clonidine if the blood pressure spikes. But as the sole agent in opioid withdrawal clonidine is a poor choice. It's got the side effect of making you feel like crap - when you already do. You'll go right back to your opiate drug if you rely on clonidine alone, trust me.

Have Tourette's as well but too soon to see if it helps.  I seem to be calmer, more relaxed- maybe too relaxed.

Lost control of my bladder after a few months of taking, (way too young at 55 to have all of those symptoms appear AFTER starting the medication). All of these symptoms become worse so I stopped taking the medication. Within 3 days of stopping the medication my bladder problems improved, my hair stopped falling out by 95%, and each day I am SLOWLY starting to feel normal again. It became so bad that I stayed in bed unable to function. This medication is awful and although it is inexpensive and easy to take, the side effects were horrible. I am slowly getting better. It also caused my blood pressure to spike. Awful medication.

I was then put on the pills that worked as well as the patch for hypertension but they make me soooo sleepy. I fall asleep in mid sentence. If I know I have quite a bit of driving to do, I wait until later to take it. My sister fell asleep driving several times when she was on it, thank God she did not get into any accidents. I did not experience these side effects when I used the patch, I really wish I could figure out some way I could go back to the patches without the allergy to the adhesive. Any suggestions?

I have injuries and take other meds for pain and muscle spasms so everything dries my mouth to the point where my tongue is stuck to my palate.

BP was 190/130 when started and down right away(1 day)after the .3 dose 2X/day. Been on it for about 1 year and like it because it lowers BP to normal and also calms me and I won't take benzos because of addiction, tolerance, withdrawal. Had severe tiredness, no energy, no motivation for 1-2 mos. but not bad any longer. The Walgreens summary sad this could last several weeks so I kept going and it did get better. When I would not take a BP med and have very high BP, I would get constant 24hr dull, pressure frontal headaches and the Clonidine, lowering my BP, took it away.
Before Clonidine, had taken 3 others and none lowered my BP below 140's/90-100. I like Clonidine, and only side effects are the tiredness which does get better with time, dry nostrils, throat and eyes(not debilitating at all).

103$Condition: High Blood Pressure$5/30/2012 11:46:22 PM$Reviewer: Nanner, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$I was switched with 3 different blood pressure pills and had a severe drug interaction, so severe I was in the hospital and had to have a shot and meds for itching. The ARNP I was told to see because my new doctor was out and her ARNP was too busy, the back ARNP took me totally off my blood pressure pills, I have been on for 10 years off because I was covered in hives. Well the next day I was in the hospital for not only the hives and trouble breathing, I was withdrawing. So the Hospital gave me Clonidine 0.1 mg and I have not felt better in years. It lowered my blood pressure really well, and I had been running high for a year. Anway, the Clonidine evened me out, and I feel like a new person. I have a cough, and dry mouth. The cough might be from the residue allergy reactions, I don't know but my doctor isn't worried about it right now. She wants me to give my body a break. So we are doing this. My legs do get a little heavy but that is alot better than hives and problems breathing from Atenolol, Metropolol or some other thing I was on. Goodness, I cannot complain, this drug really helped me out. Thank you.

It didn't start until I started taking this med. I only take a small amount and I am afraid to increase it because they say that it's very hard to get off of. I do know when I don't take it for over 24 hours my blood spikes very high. I don't recommend it to anyone. Try something else if you can because once you start taking it you will get very hypertensive.

I started out at .1 2x daily. Over time I increased (with my PCP's approval) to 1.2 mg. daily. Yes I was taking .3 4x daily. I never got over the side effects. I had them all. When it came time to increase once again, (because the dose always became ineffective over time) I was told by a pharmacist that I was taking double the regular maximum dose, & was I sure that I wanted to increase again. I got frightened by this, but also wondered why my PCP never said anything. I stayed at the same dose. Of course my BP was always too high. So I decided to taper off. I began reducing by 1/4 of .1 at a time, & I began supplementing with Lisinopril. Everything was going well for about a month. Then I started spotting. This is not good since I'm 58 & postmenopausal. It's been 11 days now & I'm bleeding to the point where I have to take an iron tablet daily. My gynecologist said that this was actually good because it meant that my estrogen levels were rising. Meaning that the Clonidine had suppressed them to begin with. I haven't spoken to my gyne since the 1st day. The bleeding is not showing any signs of stopping. Has anyone else had this experience? Can anyone give me any advice? Thanks in advance.

I split it in half or even quarters and take at meals and bedtime and check BP several times each day. 

My BP now runs 115-130 /50-60 and my pulse is down a bit: mostly in 50's.

I do have dry mouth and dry eyes (mostly at night) but this is not new.  No other side effects so far. And I am quite active, doing heavy yard work daily.

I might note that the cost of BP drugs is about $2/month vs $75 a month ago.

My doc has helped me get off all the migraine preventive drugs I'm on, with methadone being the last and hardest. The clonnidine has given me my first sleep and end to twitchiness in 3 weeks. Only taking at night, so it's good to be tired then. A little dry mouth, but I have salagen (pilocarpine) left over from taking with other drugs and that should relieve the cotton mouth if it gets bad. Such a relief to be able to go to sleep. All my life I slept well, until this withdrawal from a tiny dose of methadone. I'm at 2.5 mg of methadone, soon to go to 0, so I may not be on clonidone too long. Only taking 0.2 mg a day, in 2 doses, late afternoon and bedtime. I hope this helps others going through this crazy opiod withdrawal.

I was taking it and Tekturna (which doesn't work for African Americans I was told by the ER doctor).  Apparently he was right because my pressure was 200/128. They administered Clonidine to me in the ER to get my presurre down (and oxygen to help me breath although my oxygen level was fine, almost 100%. The ER doctor prescribed Clonidine .1 mg twice a day, Microzide 25 mg and Norvasc 5 mg. The same night I went home from the ER I had fast heart palpitations when I tried to sleep. This is the fifth day since I was given Clonidine and athough my pressure is much lower, 144/100, I had still have the heart palpitations when I go to sleep, itching and terrible night sweat (woke me out of my sleep last night).  My doctor says Clonidine is the culprit and that she will wean me off once in pressure is better.  I wonder what is the point, if it will spike again once she gets me off.  I tired alot too and can't walk long distances at my normal pace as I get winded. The heart palpitations and night sweat freaked me out and now I'm anxious about sleeping while taking this, but I can't just stop taking this med as warned and I don't want my pressure up again and in the ER.

It still makes me tired but the worst effect is dry mouth. I've spent a lot of money on dental work that my dentist says is caused by chronic dry mouth. My only complaint is that many -- and I should say most -- doctors do not understand the almost universal physical addiction this drug causes and how really sick you can get when the drug is stopped. Even tapering the drug can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Everything from vomiting, restlessness, diarrhea, headache, very high blood pressure, sweating. . . another reviewer commented on strange dreams, too. It's like a really bad case of the flu multiplied 100 times. Withdrawal can start as soon as 24 hours after your last dose. I went through perimenopause on this drug and it did nothing to stop the hot flashes.  This drug has been on the market forever.  Manufacturers need to educate the medical community on the addiction problem and the consequences of stopping the drug abruptly.  There are too many patients out there feeling really sick and they don't understand it's the lack or, or tapering of, their clonidine.

Normal resting heart rate was upper 50s.  Med dropped that to low 40s.  Initially very tired first hour after taking a whole pill.  So I change to taking 4 half pills per day.  That has helped with the tiredness.  Still do feel tired and can fall asleep on a wink.  But, that's not so new with me.  Driving has me worried.  We like to take trips.  I've found that about 30 minutes in to a 2 hour drive I'm slapping myself around to stay awake.  I noticed that if I don't take the med at regular intervals, my bp jumps around a lot.  The bp wanders around if I don't stick closely to a 6 hour schedule.  I've experimented with 2-1/2 pills during the day and one whole pill at bed time.  That didn't do a good job of control.  I'm working on trying to stay awake all day.  I find that a real strong cup of coffee and a strenous long walk first thing in the morning helps me stay awake until noon.  Found that it is almost impossible to get my heart rate over 65.  More strong coffee mid afternoon and no long sitting gets me through that time of day.  I've always been a night person, so I'm o.k. in the evening.

My ongoing problem is that I am a physiologist, with a specialty in biochemical medications. W/o Clonidine, my BP would spike to abnormal levels and upon taking my .3mg dose ( 2x/day) the pb would lower to abnormal levels. Clonidine/Catapress are fast acting
short duration chemicals; regular daily dosing will result in rebound levels of BP. Ultimately I found ( for me) taking quarter doses (.016mgs) 4x daily keeps the blood levels in a safe range, does not provide all the nasty side effects and keeps the BP at a reasonable level. Using this drug "" as needed""  or at regular recommended doses seems to impair the function of these meds. I might add, even with regular low dosing, ""as needed"" dosing may still be required as per diet and environmental conditions change daily.

She began having night terrors and sleepwaking and also started bruising easily from normal play.

166$Condition: Other$12/8/2010 11:56:16 AM$Reviewer: missJoanns, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$4$I have tried everything for insmonia, including  controlled meds like xyrem. When I take this it works wonderfully.  I found that after taking for a month, I developed rebound headaches because my blood pressure would go up in the morning.  It works by lowering your blood pressure and thereby your heart rate, and hence sleep.  My docter explained, some people will see a rebound rise in blood pressure if they do not take it two or enen three times a day, as it was developed to be taken to amintain a lower blood pressure.  In people whose bodies quickly adjust to new medications, rebound headaches will develope.  Now I take it every other day.  If you go off too fast you risk high blood pressure spikes (and if your blood pressure is already high, a possible stroke.  This is why some people have bad withdrawal symptoms.)  Always go off gradually, splitting the dose with a pill cutter and then going every other day for a while.  Hope this helps, especially for the parents out there.

My doctor wanted me to try using this medication in a patch form since he's prescribed this med. to be taken 3 times a day. I couldn't handle the patch and it was not covered by my insurance. All I know is that Clonidine effects your central nervous system so if you're sleepy while taking it that's why. It can cause nightmares as well and lately I seem to be having my share. DO get your eyes checked yearly for clonidine can damage the retina. How can a drug company allow such side effects and not be stopped from marketing this dangerous drug. I wonder why I bother to keep taking it when it doesn't seem to help my BP.

It used to take a long time to get to sleep.  However, our bigger concern was him staying asleep through the night. He was waking up 4 or 5 times a night, scared, with bad dreams.  He has rarely  ever slept all night long. He has been on .1 mg, once at night.  We give it to him about an hour and a half before bed, and by bedtime, he is ready, and asleep in minutes. He still wakes up once or twice during the night, and he doesnt always know why he wakes up.  He has wet the bed on several occasions, and woke up soaked.  I do not want to give him a higher dosage, because I am not fully comfortable with this option.  He also just started Concerta 2 days ago, and has been on Zoloft for a few months.  We also have been working with Iron Suppliments, because his Ferotin levels were very low.  But, nothing is keeping him asleep through the night. I know this works getting him asleep,just not sure if we are heading in the right direction.  We have not seen any side effects.

He has major problems at school and at home with being really hyper. He gets a ""bad"" note sent home from school everyday. He can't concentrate, can't be still at all, just extremely hyper. It would take him at least an hour to fall asleep at night. With his 1st dose last night he was asleep in 20 minutes. He woke up this morning a little tired but in a good mood. I have been so scared to medicate him but don't want him to struggle all his life if there are other options. If we all say prayers for each others children it can't hurt. As I am praying for yours please pray for my grandson. (he lives with me) THANKS and good luck to you all!"

After a thorough eval, the doctor put me on Clonidine for withdrawal symptoms and Ativan for anxiety. The combination floored me ... I slept all day and all night with very few moments of lucidity. It took my normal, healthy resting heart rate from 70 to 50, and made me feel completely dazed and confused. No more jitters from withdrawal, and got the doc's okay to stop using it (only took total 4 doses), so we'll see what happens. If the jitters come back, he said its okay to use again ... I'm praying that was it! Didn't like how I felt on this drug at all. Extreme tiredness, depression and slow heartbeat were my side effects.

No crackers in bedside drawer.Went to kitchen holding on to edges, but ended up sprawled on the floor and had to call 911.I had gotten some salt into my system by then.By the time they came, my blood pressure had normalized. I have also been plagued by awful nightmares, sometimes one every two hours. LAst night Dec.15 was particularly bad. Had three of them and woke up sweating, with my BP as high as if I had taken nothing at all! It took a lot of deep breathig to get my system under control.

The most intense and I'm dealing with right now is whatit does to my BLadder. I am  in  alot of pain in the bladder region with urgency and efrequency. I have been checked our for U.T.I which I get often enough with having I.C (Cystitis without infection), and I am convinced that this drug has flared me up in my bladder. I also get acid reflux from this drug as well. Have a feeling of :""La la land"" sometimes with this medication. I overall just feel sickly with taking Clonidine and unfortunately for me all the other B.P. meds have other bad side effects. Clonidine however is tough on the kidneys hence my dr. Quack should never have prescribed it to me because I have a chronic Bladder issue. RME. Hope  some have better luck with this because for me it isn't a keeper. 
NOt going to continue to take a drug that makes me sicker than before taking it. That doesn't benefit me at all. Good luck P.S. also upper reflux into mouth as well with Clonidine. You feel like acid coming up into your throat. badddd"

My grandson who just turned 3 was diagnosed with many disabilities,one being a major behavioral issue. Because my sons ex does everything without consulting him (even though he has joint custody) she took my grandson to her physician and he prescribed this medication for him. Everything I have read says not to give to children under the age of 12. That concerns me. Also, my son refuses to give him this medication when he has him. I am worried after what I have been learning that his abrupt interruption of the medication will have an adverse reaction. I am very concerned for my grandson.

Ace inhibiters was causing a cough but they worked. On this drug for about a month still trying to regulate the amount. Was given 0.2mg twice daily but if I took that amount it put me to sleep. Now trying one half at night and one in the morning but still got me sleepy. So today going to one half early and one half about noon and see how that works. One pill in the morning dropped my BP way down to 111/67 much too low for me to function properly. At that level I was a little dizzy and off balance and had to force myself to get up and move around. We will see how this works breaking it up. Doctor does not seem to care they just write a perscription and say come back in a year.

I took a single 0.1 mg tablet (as I normally do when this happens)& within 30 min my bp was down to 160/90 & within an hour it was down to about 125/80! This medication has saved my life many times over the past 10 yrs. I am extremely grateful that it's available & works for me. I never knew it had any side effects until I read about them here. I suppose it is because  I do not take it on a regular basis, or maybe I just don't notice them because I am so happy that I don't have to rush to the e.r. everytime my bp goes crazy. I just have to take a clonidine and rest for a couple of hours to be as good as new!!

My son, 5 years old, was diagnosed as having ADHD. My ex-wife and I are divorced and live four hours away so it's hard to be involved on a daily basis. 

My son saw a psychiatrist who prescribed the Clonidine on an ""as needed"" basis at bedtime. I thought that's how my ex-wife was giving it to him but I later found out that she was giving it to him every day.

Anyhow, his new psychaitrist said that it's dangerous to miss a dose and that he needs this medication EVERY day. 

From what I've read, it seems like withdrawl from Clonidine is ONLY dangerous if you give it to someone (in this case my child) for a long period of time (more than 30 days). 

I guess what I'm asking/saying here is that if my son was presribed Clonidine on an ""as needed"" basis, there is no concern for withdrawl, correct?"

After taking in the morning I could not stay awake and would fall asleep on the job, so with the Dr's permission I only take 1/2 tablet in the morning along with my other blood pressure medications which included a beta blocker.  I managed to stay awake as long as I was moving.  The minute I stopped moving I fell asleep.  I take 1/2 tablet in the morning and 1/2 tablet in the evening and one whole tablet before going to bed.  The pill causes me to dream nonstop plus getting up frequently to use the bathroom.   I barely get any sleep and now I have started having heart palpitations.  At first the pill would cause me to go to sleep at night but now I don't fall asleep rapidly and it feels like at times I'm about to have an anxiety attack.  I usually resist it by concentrating on something else.  I don't like this pill because now I'm afraid I'll never be able to get off of it.  Along with the other medications I take I am fatigued all the time, can barely do housework unless I do not take any of the blood pressure medication, then I experience a rise in my blood pressure.  The doctors have not offered me a substitution for this drug.  Is there one?  I have also had a hysterectomy and do not know what effect that has on my body concerning my blood pressure.

I am Bi-Polar 1 and I can tell you one thing from many doctors and YEARS of personal experience Bi-polar is not just random mood swings.  It is also random other conditions I have periods of ocd, add, adhd,and many many other things.  This is one of the many problems with bi-polar it really isn't always one disease it is often many at the same time or even may show almost nothing for periods of time (that's my experience as well as a lot of others that I have spoken to.) If your child or you are bi-polar, depending on how your cycles are you may end up changing meds on a regular basis as your body chemistry changes. I have had some great and horrible pill mixes(up to 10 at a time) but for the last few years I have settled on a mix that sort of works most of the time with adderal, ambien, and sometimes others on an ""as needed"" basis.  My point is work slowly with the pills, don't assume that because a pill does one thing good/bad today it will be the same effect later, either alone or in combination of other drugs.  
 I was actually prescribed this a few months ago for VERY high blood pressure and they took me off my adderal for obvious reasons.  Unfortunately I just didn't ""feel like"" going to the doctor to get more pills and up until this week I have been off them.  I am having the same symptoms as I did the last time  for roughly the first week. Severe headaches, insane cotton mouth and having trouble keeping my eyes open. the last one most likely has to do with the fact that I also ran out of my other pills a few days ago and I am getting used to them again.  I took .2 morning and night before but now am trying .1 twice a day.  At the time it didn't occur to me until I stopped taking it that it did help some with my current addhd because she adderal worked so well that I felt like this wasn't doing it, plus I assumed it the lower bp.

My BP would go up at night at times and I would take 0.2 clonidine to bring it back down. Sometimes BP would come down after taking clonidine.  I discovered deep breathing exercises brought BP down when I didn""t take the extra clonidine.  I am now on an ACE drug and HCTZ .

He has a milder form of TS, ADHD (originally diagnosed as depression) and OCD.  He has been on Catapres TTS-1 patch weekly for about 7 months now and also takes adderall once a day for ADHD. The oral form of Clonidine (Catapres brand) did not work as well or last as long for the tics or OCD. Went to patch & worked great, but now back to oral due to bad skin irritation. We will be alternating oral & patch.  It has done well.

Clonidine was just prescribed for my 2 1/2 year old son due to his extreme hyperactivity.  They stated they aren't sure whether he shows signs of ADHD or BI Polar.  
After reading all the posts regarding young children and the side effects.
I am choosing NOT to give this medication to my son and will deal with his hyperactivity until he is at the age to be properly checked for ADHD.
I didn't have my child till I was 39 and he was a premie at birth, after years of fertility drugs when I was younger and a new marriage, this is my miracle baby. 
I am not willing to take any un-necessary chances with his life.
THANKS FOR ALL THE WONDERFUL INPUT!

How did a doctor determine that your THREE YEAR OLD, had extreme ADHD? After going through four doctors I found one that sent my son for real testing for ADHD, the first three said ""Oh he's hyper, we'll put him on this"".We were told that children should be around 5 or 6 before being diagnosed. My son has TS, ADHD,OCD. He is on concerta in the morning and clonodine at night. It hasn't changed how funny and articulate he is but helps slow down the hyperactivity that even HE would say made him mad because he couldn't do things HE wanted to do. Children should only be on ADHD meds when appropriatley tested.Alot of doctors assume the parents are good to their children and that the child isn't being abused ect.. at home causing the ADHD like symptoms.Parents whose children actually have ADHD and chose to medicate should NEVER be viewed as lazy. We are far from it. We work our asses off,(sorry:), to make sure that the child is happy and occupied in a productive way. I have two other children and we have to make sure that each child gets equal treatment while trying to control the sugar,caffeine, and stimuls intake my son with ADHD ect.. gets. Most teachers I have encountered,even though my son's in a special ed inclusion class, think because my son can suppress alot of his Tourettes symptoms that they will be the one that will ""fix"" him. The life a family with a special needs child is one that wants to thrive with the disorders instead of surving in spite of them. Many children are misdiagnosed with ADHD but that only makes the stigma harder for the children, whom actually have it, to overcome. Take diagnosing serious, and make sure your doctor takes the appropriate steps to diagnose. Don't try to diagnose your child for this as a toddler, their attention and hyperactivity levels are usually high and differ from child to child. I didn't medicate my son until he was almost done with kindergarten,6 yrs old).Sorry for the novel:)"

At the end of first grade my son still couldn't pay enough attention to learn to read or write. After starting this medication, he's been able to get sleep (yay for me finally too) and can sit still in class and in just the last month has made huge progress learning to read. I hate drugging kids, but sometimes there are reasons beyond our control that the kids need it - this being one of them. He has responded well, with no known side effects. To me, this allows him to be who he really is and who he really wants to be.
