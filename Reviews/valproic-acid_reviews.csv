0$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/14/2015 2:37:14 AM$Reviewer: Olive, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$5$"I was prescribed this medication by my psychiatrist along with Cipralex (escitalopram) for anti-depression. I have since stopped taking both but while I was on them both I was very uncomfortable and I was far more mentally unstable. I was very aggressive and lethargic.

While escitalopram isn't listed as one of the drugs it can react with I would still say to be careful with it. At the time I was under 18 and I'd approximate about 130lbs, and 5'2"" if that helps. Sex is female."
1$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/24/2014 9:00:55 PM$Reviewer: Jespicable, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$3$Diagnosed Bipolar. Weight gain is obvious. I had to take it daily, and I was getting used to that. Manic state is more controlled now, but I hated the weight gain... I'm having difficulty losing it now. Anyway, for its primary use, it's effective.

3$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/20/2014 7:12:09 PM$Reviewer: Sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Good drug except for weight gain and heartburn. Doc says it's the Remeron that causes the weight gain. I think it is the Remeron and the Valproic Acid. I take 500 mgs in am and 500 mgs at night.
4$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/7/2012 6:55:53 AM$Reviewer: builderboy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$After years of fighting Depression the new Dr. tried this med and it started to work for the better. I didn't know I was bi-polar but my new wife did and she wasn't afraid to speak up as she too deals with depression.

Weight gain seems to be the most noticable side effect, 10-12 lbs., then infrequent fluctuations of approx. 5 lbs or so. I also take sertraline; buproprion, propranolol, trazodone. Mild side effects overall.
6$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/18/2011 3:44:40 AM$Reviewer: Perty, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$Initially my mood was stabilized on this med for 5-6 months. About the 4-5th month I experienced swollen and painfulness in my right hand. It was easy to use in the liquid form.
7$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/13/2010 10:10:06 PM$Reviewer: billddrummer, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Was prescribed valproic acid after a psychotic break arrested with lithium and prozac.  Initially diagnosed with depression, subsequently altered to bipolar disorder.  Have been on 750 mg divided dose for several years, no significant side effects.  Went off medication for 3 months, had a manic episode characterized by wild overspending and other dangerous behaviors.  Resumed medication regimen and brought symptoms under control within 3 weeks.  I have had good success with this medication.

9$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/17/2010 6:02:23 AM$Reviewer: Stephanie A., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$In the beginning this medication worked great for my Bipolar/ Manic Depression. My only complaint was the indigestion it gave me. I started gaining a lot of weight and my hair started falling out at around 4 months. I have gained 35 lbs in 5 months and lost over half my hair by the time my doctor told me to stop this medication. I had decreased my dose to 1/4 mgs until I could see her. This caused me to become more anxious than ever and began having bad anxiety attacks. Been off it for 2 weeks and my hair is still falling out really bad. My pharmacist suggested I take AG Pro (behind the counter at Wal-Mart but non-prescription). I am extremely unsatisfied with this medication and wish I had never started taking it.

I still eat right and exercise, but nothing works....any suggestions?

Have been taking Depakote (Valproic Acid) for 10 years. Does anyone have any eye problems taking this drug?

14$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/22/2009 11:00:06 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$NOT SURE HAVEN'T TAKEN IT LONG ENOUGH FIRST TIME ON THIS MEDS.
15$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/28/2009 11:39:20 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I am a 135lb female who was put on 1500mg of this immediately and was told that my blood level was fine, I was almost comatose! I couldn't get off the couch for days on end, finally my local doctor lowered my dose and I am now down to 250mg daily--I fell human again, I'll take the depression over this!
16$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/27/2008 8:17:41 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$2$On this and Abilify. I'm not quite feeling myself just yet. This medication gives me bad heartburn. I also experience blurred vision after taking my meds. Not so much weight gain, but it does make my head feel a little funny.
17$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/24/2007 10:23:08 AM$Reviewer: MTgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$1$I am Bipolar and have a seizure disorder.  I am frustrated that I have to take 10 - 250mg pills to get the correct does.  That's a lot of pills!  It is also the only medication I can afford.  I have hair loss and hand tremors.  I don't know about weight gain.  I don't think I can attribute all my weight gain to my meds.  I'm lazy.  I don't feel it controls all my bipolar symptoms and I don't want to increase my dose any further.  I would love to try something else with fewer pills that I could still afford.
18$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/17/2007 11:54:07 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$3$5$Recetly diagnosed with Bi-Polar. First medication. Worked great on mood with pleasant side effect of deminished food intolerances. No more lactose intolerance etc. Downside it caused hands to swell and severe joint pain in already damaged knees. Changed to DIVALPROEX. Mood correction the same but food intolerance came back.
19$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/30/2007 5:35:42 PM$Reviewer: jl1971, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$3$3$You have to take so many of the pills. But this seemed to be the only generic brand of mood-stabilizer I could find and that's all my insurance would cover. I was on Depakote which is my preference.
