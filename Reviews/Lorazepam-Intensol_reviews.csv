7$Condition: Other$3/10/2008 3:13:58 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $2$3$4$My grandson has epilepsy he is 3 1/2 years old. The Doctor has put him on this when he gets sick or with increased seizures. Recently the Dr. put him on .25ml 3 times for 3 days  then 2 times 3 days then he had a seizures and then they said to go back to 2 times a day for 6 days and then 1 time for 3 days. Today  is his first day without anything and his coordination is off.  He has been falling over during the day, he is alert.  He doesn't walk, as he has a plate in his hip which they can't take out until the seizures are under control. What is causing him to fall over?  He will be going to the Dr. tomorrow. Is this common in children?
