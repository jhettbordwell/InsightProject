0$Condition: Panic Disorder$5/27/2019 2:47:41 PM$Reviewer: KJC77, 35-44 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$4$This med helps but I don't like the long term effect on the brain especially short term memory loss. I'm taking a med for ADHD which helps my mind stay sharp and a low dose of Zyprexa Zydis to control irritability and panic attacks while getting off this medication. It does the job to stop panic attacks but not everyone responds to this med in the same way. Over several years I went from taking 6mg of klonopin to 1.5mg of klonopin. It is a very difficult med to get off of but I only recommend you take it if you are in constant state of panic and terror. My life went from having panic attacks which led to depression and eventually led to bipolar disorder. I'm tapering off the medication slowly but I don't know if I like the way I'm feeling. While tapering off of it, I've noticed that I am more antisocial(nonviolent) but I think this is temporary till Klonopin leaves my system. Be careful and choose your medications wisely. I hope you find peace in your life.

4$Condition: Panic Disorder$12/17/2018 9:19:08 AM$Reviewer: Howdy Doody, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication saved my life. I suffer from crippling arthritis and failed spinal fusion. I was taking diazepam on and on for 20 years with opioid therapy. I was stable on them. Suddenly my pain doctor did not look at my medical history and see that I could not take SRI SSRI having tried them all. The fentanyl insert states benzodiazepine therapy is reserved for people that cannot take SRI drugs. A more knowledgeable pain doctor recognized this an put me on clonazepam. I had been off the valium for 5 months and nearly died. The CDC opioid prescribing guidelines are actually Guidelies.

I spent every waking hour with racing thoughts. One dose and they are gone! I use them with fentanyl patches because I cannot take any SRI, SSRI because they cause serotonin syndrome and clonus.

It will cure anxiety and panic attacks but it will destroy your life because the addiction to this drug happens before you know it.  When you don't have it, you are in hell.  Read what Stevie Nicks said about this drug.  You have been warned.  She said it destroyed eight years of her life and it did the same for me. I had to hold to rehab and my withdrawal symptoms we're worse than herion addicts.  As soon as I got out of rehab,, I went psychiatrist shopping to get a prescription back bcz I was a zombie without it.  I lied and never told the psychiatrist that I was in rehab for this drug.  It will help you at first but then destroy you in the end.  Run away from Benzos.

This has been the most effective drug for me, no side effects like drowsiness. I have cut down to about 0.25 mg fairly easily , so don't get scared by those who write crazy stories about withdrawal symptoms! Just go slowly. 
8$Condition: Panic Disorder$5/22/2018 2:49:08 PM$Reviewer: nancyj, 65-74 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I took this medication for aout 10 yrs (.5 mg tid). Then my psychiatrist changed to Valium because he was concerned about Alzheimers. After several months, I started having panic attacks again, and Valium was no help. He put me back on Klonopin (same dose as before) with no mention of Alzheimers, Klonopin has made it possible for me to keep on living and to WANT to live. I can't be worrying about withdrawals or Alzheimers -- I'm happy to be alive. Main side effect: hair loss.

Why is it legal to prescribe?  It is cited to be potentially fatal and there seems to be no benefit to it for anything, a drug that's listed as harmful.
10$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/15/2018 11:56:14 PM$Reviewer: Articfox, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I first was prescribed this when I was 20. I had ocd issues however could not handle any ssri's so doctor prescribed this. It worked wonderful. Took 2mg 2x a day along with perphenazine 2mg 2x a day. Had no side effects except for sex drive declining. Even drank beer with no issues.  After 25 years of this the pills just stopped working and I fell in withdrawal. Now I try to take them but I get the reverse effects and all the side effects My world is crashing and been homebound ever since Jan. All my original disorders are back as well. Hopefully  diazepam can take it's place. Better than hoping too grab a lucky pill out of the bottle which doesn't work. I had no clue this was an additive drug but need something after 2 months being off it. Wondering if I should take anything at all at this point however, the panic I am experiencing is really bad to the point becoming dizzy every day I wish it worked again. Be careful with this drug but it really is spectacular when it does work

12$Condition: Other$10/31/2017 10:58:48 PM$Reviewer: tinguy67, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I suffered from mild tinnitus for a couple of months after a loud explosion at work. It was slowly lessening, but my family doctor prescribed klonopin to help in the meantime.  At first it was great, the tinnitus went away completely.  However, after a couple of months on the medication, I started noticing memory loss and confused thinking.  My doctor told me to taper for 2 weeks and get off the klonopin, because apparently this is a common side effect.  5 days after cutting 1/4th of my dose, I began experiencing painful muscle spasms in my limbs, and 2 days later I felt like someone poured boiling water over my skin.  I went to the ER and found out that nuropathy (feeling like your skin has suffered a severe chemical burn) is common when coming off of klonopin and other benzos, and the ER told me it and the muscle spasms would go away in a couple of days, once the klonopin was out of my system.  It didn't.  Not only did the burning sensation get more severe and widespread over the next several weeks, but my tinnitus came back 100x worse than it was before I started therapy.  A month later I went back to the doctor when the issues didn't subside, but the doctor insisted that since the klonopin was out of my system, it couldn't be causing these issues.  It took 3 full months for the nuropathy and muscle spasms to finally subside, but my tinnitus is still much worse than it was before i started therapy.  Before klonopin, it was a mild hum.  Since stopping klonopin, it sounds like an airhorn is going off in my ear.  After doing some research, I found that many people have their original condition get much worse after benzo therapy.

At first it seemed like a lifesaver, but after a few months, it didn't seem to be helping, so the doctor doubled my dose. 
A few weeks later, my panic attacks went from a few times a month to almost daily, and were much more severe than the ones I started taking klonopin for in the first place.  The doctor told me to cut back down to my original dose, and my body went crazy - muscle spasms, intense panic attacks, loud ringing in my ears, and nauseated all the time.  I would give anything to go back to my ""old"" panic attacks, which for years only hit once or twice a month for a few minutes at a time.  These klonopin panic attacks are lasting for hours at a time, and I am basically housebound between the panic and the physical pain.  I am now slowly tapering off this medication, dropping .1mg at a time every month.  I have read that it is actually quite common for klonopin to increase anxiety and panic attacks.  Why didn't the doctor tell me this could happen?"

19$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/18/2017 4:50:47 PM$Reviewer: Special Someone, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I've been on this for about a year. Very low dosage and take only when need. Works much better when I'm having an anxiety attack take 1/2 of a 1mg and I calm down within minutes. Only when I take regular is when things seem sad, I feel sorry for everybody, I'm more scared than normal. All I do now is take half and pray it works wonders. Now I'm barely taken the half because God has made me feel more better. But if I do have a bad attack I know I could take 1/2. Try to only take when you are having a major attack and half gives you more control. You take something long enough your body depends on it. But if you only treat a medical issue for that moment your not co dependent. Good luck to all us special people. We truly are one of a kind. Even if we are sensitive. Just take control don't let it control us. We know we need our meds but just take half for each attack.

I have noticed after a day of being a little up, the Klonopin drops the intensity and brain energy nicely to allow for rest and relaxing. I do notice that if I don't take it, because I may not feel like I need it one night, that it is harder to get to sleep. I also have experienced some short term memory loss when taking 1.5 mg (3 x .5 mg) the next day. It has also helped me with anxiety when depressed. Great drug!

My first shrink in 86 put me on Haldol. Oh my God, that was horrible. I was on different medications until 1994 when I got on klonopin. That pill is a miracle drug. I don't have to take it everyday anymore but I always carry it with me in my purse just in case. I do take other meds for depression and they also help but nothing like klonopin. Because I hear it can contribute to Alzheimer's I try not to take it daily. That's all I need ontop of my other mental problems. I would advise anyone to take klonopin for major panic attacks but try not to take a lot of it for long periods. Maybe in conjunction with something else u can take less.

I had to stop taking it 6 days ago, since my doctor refuses to prescribe it any longer.  My primary care doctor, in Brooklyn, NY, gave it to me with no problem. However, since I moved to Jersey, it is a nightmare trying to find a good doctor.  It is my Jersey doctor who would not prescribe it any longer, and the withdrawal is killing me.  I literally feel as though I am losing my mind. Even as I type this, it is as if I am in a dream (or a nightmare), I am dripping with sweat (very unusual for me), my stomach is killing me, I have a huge headache, and am exhausted.  My anxiety level is through the roof as well. Exactly, how long can I look forward to this party? If I can tough it out until I feel normal (although I was on this cause my anxiety was out of control), I cannot decide whether or not I will commit homicide or suicide.

I am much better and I did not have to go on a higher dose. I take 0.5mg. twice  a day. It is the withdrawals that cause the horror stories you hear about. Not the drug itself for me.

At first I took it every day at 1mg doses for the first 6 months. Now only take it when I need it at 0.5mg's. It works great for general anxiety. If you have something such as a major fear of public speaking its not going to kill that anxiety 100 % by itself. Consider taking it with Propranolol. That combination is a miracle worker. But as far as just general anxiety goes Klonopin by itself is great. I've never really had any major withdraw side effects with it but then I'm at a small dose anyways. When I'm taking it I feel really at ease with my thoughts and others around. If you take this please don't be a jerk while taking it. Enjoy the fact your finally not anxious for once and at peace. Some people use it as an excuse to act stupid or annoying. Sure your going to feel nice while your taking it but don't be 'that guy' and give people a bad reputation that need to take it to function normally. You are still in control and your not drunk so be responsible.

I find that if you are ready to go to sleep it is very effective, but if you are awake in the middle of the day, it won't put you to sleep. Nice calming effect without that ""zombie"" feeling.

I've been prescribed it for over 5 years now. It works wonderfully. It really is a miracle for those who suffer from panic and anxiety. It takes about an hour to kick in, but it lasts for at least 5 hours. It kicks in much faster if you put it under your tongue and let it dissolve. Some side effects include drowsiness, lack of a ""filter"" when talking, very slight clumsiness/lack of balance, and very slight memory loss. It works great right before bed if you can't sleep, too. A little goes a long way. Half of a milligram doesn't sound like much, but it is. Klonopin is very potent. Word of caution: DO NOT take this every day. You will get tolerant to it, and you will need more of the drug to feel any relief. DO NOT drink when taking this. You will do things you regret, black out, and not remember anything that happened. I highly suggest, with every fiber of my being, to take Klonopin only as needed, and only when absolutely necessary. The last thing you want is to take 1mg of Klonopin and not feel any relief. And that is exactly what will happen when you take Klonopin every day or otherwise abuse it."

41$Condition: Panic Disorder$7/8/2015 8:52:20 AM$Reviewer: devo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I've taken this medication at several different times in my life due to moderate panic/anxiety. Was prescribed this after taking Ativan which was too strong for me. I would go entire days feeling like i was sleep-walking on Ativan. I started taking .5 mg twice daily and found myself agitated so I started splitting the pills and .25 mg twice daily and I no longer had agitation. After a few weeks I noticed that I stopped worrying so much about things that stress me out. Also had no noticeable side effects. This is definitely a mild benzo and, at least in my experience, doesn't cause the drowsy/drugged feeling that other benzos do. It almost helps without really noticing it's helping if that makes sense. Each time I've taken this I've weened myself off of it when I felt I no longer needed it. Never really had any withdrawal. Lately due to increase work and stress at my job I have considered asking my doctor if I could go back on it.

I have ADHD, ocd, and anxiety. I have taken .5 once a day at bedtime for a little over a year. I have forgotten a few doses but no horror story withdrawals I have read. 
Negative side effects will occur if you don't see your doctor regularly, don't follow the doctor's instructions , have a history of addiction, and / or are mixing he drug with  alcohol  and/ or other drugs unbeknownst to your doctor. This is a controlled substance .  I am also in therapy and we have a plan of treatment. My doctor is very conservative with meds. If you're going to a doctor who prescribes ANYTHING ""like candy"" as described here by many reviewers , then you are putting your life in the hands of a dangerous person, in my opinion . If you're having issues that a psychiatrist deems  serious enough to require psychotropic meds, then you need to be on a track toward healing, not just taking a drug randomly when you feel like it . That's why regular appointments are important. If you aren't seeing a real psychiatrist in addition to the right therapist with a holistic approach when on these serious medications, you're making a big mistake . Medications are only a band aid -a temporary solution to alleviate symptoms until the root of the problem is discovered and resolved."

Please understand that now. Chemically speaking it's just barely a benzo. When I was first prescribed this it was a direct switch from Xanax. Well...that didn't go over too well! Went into extreme Xanax withdrawals, I was sweating so hard (and shaking) that it frightened me - Klonopin was a poor direct replacement for Xanax. I came to learn that Klonopin simply doesn't share all the characteristics of other benzodiazepines. People need to know this upfront, lest they find it out the hard way. The only plus, perhaps, is that Klonopin doesn't have a strongly sedating component. So it might be useful for those wanting to maintain 100% alertness during the day. That's about it. Common side effects characteristic of Klonopin: very glassy eyes and a distinct change in behavior. Me, I became too 'outspoken' while on it. And not in a good way.

The worst is yet to come. 
I too, was amazed at how awesome I was and felt when I started taking it.  There's no question Klonopin works very well. It just works too well...until the dosage isn't enough. It's not that it stops working on your brain, it just becomes confusing to the patient because old symptoms start to re-appear. It's still breaking through the blood brain barrier and shutting down/taking over your Gaba receptors though. The problem is, the brain has now begun to rely on the drug instead of its own calming mechanism, so it needs more. Most Drs just up the dose, which only makes the brain more dependent, shutting down more receptors. 
Klonopin was never intended as a drug to be taken long term, for very good reason. 
I ended up in the emergency room 4 different times b/c I was in tolerance withdrawal. I didn't know I was, until the 4th ER visit to a different hospital. The dr was smart enough to know, to tell me and to contact my dr. That was over a year ago and I've been tapering since then. It's been a roller coaster but nothing compared to now, as I'm at .25mg pills that I'm slowly cutting down each week. 
There's no way to explain the withdrawals. Ive always kept my body as healthy and strong as possible, but this little pill is a ticket to hell. Ive suffered so many grand mal seizures but I'd rather deal with the seizures, than go thru this hell again. 
I have zero respect for anyone associated with delving this poison out.  Honestly, you are all satan's little helpers.

59$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/16/2014 11:44:59 AM$Reviewer: Smash, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$4$I am writing this post to warn all who are interested in taking any benzodiazepan - they can be extremely helpful but are incredibly physically addictive and often times your GP or prescribing physician does not inform you of that.  I was taking Klonopin once a day at 1 MG for about 4 months and then I leaned how addictive it was and stopped cold turkey.  My mistake - I narrowly avoided having a seizure and didn't sleep for almost a week or eat or anything due to the withdrawal.  I went back to taking them and had a psychiatist wean me off of them, and I still experienced withdrawal symptons though not as bad.  So, please be careful, only take it when you need it, and consult with a physician when you choose to stop taking it.  I am currently taking it again - though only as needed, and no more than 3 times a week - because life stressors have been more than I can handle lately.  So, just please be careful with this drug, it can be so helpful but in the long run the cure may be worse than the cause.

It absolutely worked miracles for controlling the panic disorder ( for some reason I prefer to call them anxiety attacks, sounds less severe). Initially I had been put on Celexa & Valium. At some point Zoloft replaced the Celexa, & Klonopin replaced the Valium. Good moves on both fronts. Then, Abilify was added. HUGE MISTAKE FOR ME. While initially I thought I felt better, it was almost like the 'manic' phase of bi-polar. I had a period of time where I made some bizarre life choices, became extremely selfish, but at the same time felt invincible. After one of those poor life choices backfired spectacularly, I made the connection to the Abilify. Switched psychiatrists, she took me off, & things have been much better since.

The second time, one of the doctors recommended I see a psychiatrist. Although I didn't think it was all in my head, I took his advice and made an appointment. I remember being in the waiting room, pacing, wishing I would just fall to the floor unconscious.

The psychiatrist diagnosed me with panic disorder and started Klonopin .5 twice a day. She said it was the drug with the highest hit rate.

My god...I couldn't believe it. After suffering for such a long time, I was finally free of the panic!

I was slightly drowsy for two days, and then no side effects whatsoever except the relief from the horror. The medication allowed me to get back to my life, and glad to do so.

I have been on Klonopin almost 25 years now. I take 3 or 4 mg per day. As the years have passed, and I have moved and gotten new doctors, often they have tried many different drugs, but not only have these never worked, but have made matters worse in a couple of cases.

FMS is complicated by patients not getting to a deep, restorative sleep stage. In my case, my mind just won't switch off at bedtime.

It was like the absolute worst acid trip I've ever been on and no Doctor, therapist or psychiatrist will help you. They will leave you to go through this hellacious withdrawal at home, totally alone. Klonopin withdrawal forced me to have to make the decision of either continue living in a world filled with nothing more than excruciating pain, terror, anxiety and fear or DIE, and I prayed so hard for death. It is criminal that this drug is even legal. And it's worse that not one single professional will tell you a damn thing. The National guidelines for prescribing this Benzo is 2-4 weeks.

In my opinion I would rate Klonopin at the top of all benzodiazepines (and i've tried almost all of them) as it has a relatively long half-life (lasts longer than most benzos). I have been taking .25mg (1/2 of a .5mg tablet) daily for nearly a decade now, and I have had no urge or need to increase my dosage (although it does take discipline to take the absolutely smallest effective amount without wanting to experiment with more).  This dosage, combined with regular cardio excercise, has eliminated what was once extreme debilitating panic/anxiety.  If you're going to start this medication, take small amounts (experiment with the smallest dosage possible that still remedies your anxiety, etc).  Don't ever get into the habit of taking more, and stay indifferent to people, doctors, the media, etc, who criticize the use of this medication. Become comfortable with the likelihood that you may need to take this medication permanently. In other words, if you maintain a small daily dose regimin, there's no need to put yourself through the pain of ceasing the use of this wonderful medication. I am certain it is much more harmful to stop taking this medication than it would be to continue to use it responsibly for a life-time.

If I get angry, then take the Klonopin, 15 minutes later I turn into the nicest person...it is a miracle drug but don't abuse it because you will experience withdrawal symptoms that are awful to deal with but otherwise it is very effective. I have no side effects from it either so that's also a good reason why it's a good drug for me.

Took it as prescribed and felt for once in my life balanced and even tempered...helped with so many of my other conditions as well, gi problems, etc.  Only went off once suddenly because I had a back injury and didn't want to take pain meds with klonipin...never do that again!!! Much healthier for me to NOT take pain meds but stay on klonipin...during most of the year I have lessened the dosage to 1 1/2 tabs per day ....taken 1/2 3pm, and 1 at bedtime.  I cannot take other meds like elavil or nortriptolene ...those make me jump out of my skin and turn me severely depressed.  Have never felt like jumping off a high deck but elavil and nortriptolene did!!! It's all blood chemistry and you must work closely with your health care provider at all times.  Klonipin works wonders for me.  Also be careful though with mixing it with any other drugs...look at the ingredients and any contraindications,

I took it for 3 weeks at 1mg per day and I felt like I lost 3 weeks of my life... as in I remembered it happening, but didn't feel like I was even there. I quit my job, I got pulled over for driving erratically and I cried every night. I felt like there was no way out, and my husband asked me to stop the medication and call my doctor immediately. I hadn't talked to most of my friends, but the one I did told me something hadn't been right but she didn't know what. I've never lost hope like that before. I talked to the magistrate about the ticket I received,  got a note fromy doctor... but it turns out the magistrate didn't even need it. He said he was very familiar with the drug and implied that he wished it weren't even on the market. The only other stories I have heard directly from people are similar if not so severe. The drug even earned a comment on 'Silver Linings Playbook.' I am terrified of this drug, and what it could do to other people out there. Maybe it works for some, but as with any mood drug please me extra careful. I am now on Depakote for mood instead and my anxiety has subsided. Also consider a good therapist before messing around with this stuff.

Feel a light buzz at 1mg shortly after taking it but nothing else.  At 2mg my anxiety begins to get reduced and mood is slightly boosted and every milligram above that reduces my anxiety accordingly but doesn't make me any more euphoric than the 2mg dose.  Mood and anxiety are affected 30 minutes after dosing. Drowsiness kicks in a few hours after dosing.  Memory and cognitive impairment can begin on as low as a 3mg dosage for me since I have little benzodiazepine tolerance built up.  Doses above 3mg, watch out.  Blackoutland and confusion while blacking out (I recorded myself).  Too bad, because my anxiety was actually manageable for those 12 or 24 hours after dosing.  I settle for 2mg doses.  This way I avoid most of the drowsiness and avoid cognitive and memory impairment while getting to feel a slight mood boost and some anxiety relief.

I wish I had never taken it.  I wish the dr. that prescribed it had told me it was addictive.  After taking klonopin for a year I realized I had to get off the stuff...  6 months of hell followed.  I had seizures, half of my face was paralyzed, I had severe migraines and HORRID    panic attacks.  I couldn't sleep.  It was awful.  Now after 2 years after recovering I am somewhat back to my old self.  I still have insomnia and occasional panic attacks that I did not have before.

They are extremely effective in controlling anxiety and panic disorders. They are also extremely addictive. Doctor's like Klonopin because it has a long half-life. Apparently, some people do have a body chemistry that keeps them from getting addicted, or it could be how they take the medication. I have been on Benzo's 19 years. I have CFS. I tried an adrenal supplement for it and it caused the panic disorder. So at age 34 I was put on Benzo's. I'm almost 54 now. The addiction started around the one-year mark. It nearly killed me. Now I wear 2 watches so I can take my morning and evening dose to the second. My body is synchronized to a 3rd watch that I don't set the alarm on so I won't run down the battery. That is the one I take my pills by. Also, because each pill is a different weight I bought a precision scale and I file each pill down to the same weight. But each batch of the drug has a different amount of medicine in it so some months I'd start feeling sick and I had to increase my dose ever so slightly using the scale. AND, pharmacies like to change the brand you're on so that has been a battle. I had a close friend who committed suicide because of her Klonopin addiction. She was an OB/GYN nurse, with CFS. That was about 15 years ago. Now, I'm taking care of my elderly mother who lives with me and still managing my addiction (with the help of a wonderful and very understanding psychiatrist). Oh, my dose is 1mg twice a day. I hope this will help someone. Good luck and be careful.

I have anxiety/panic attacks. My nurse practitioner prescribed this drug (1 mg)for me but after a few weeks I still was having anxiety attacks. According to her she said they should have gone away by now but they didn't. I could tell she didn't want to keep prescribing it to me because she said it could be addicting. So I went to see a psychiatrist who had no problem with me taking this drug. It made me feel NORMAL!!! I don't get high from this medication at all, it just makes me feel normal. I have always been high strung all my life and to me it's been a miracle drug. He prescribes me 1 mg. 2x daily. All I ever take is 1 mg and if I can get away with biting the pill in half and get relief then that is all I will take. I do or did have concerns about addiction and my psychiatrist told me it wasn't an addicting drug as long as I don't abuse it, which I don't. He also asked if I drink alcohol and I may have a few drinks a few times a year or even go years without drinking(just not my thing). He then asked when I do drink do I get drunk easily which I don't. He said for me not to worry about it then and he didn't see me getting addicted. I don't have any side effects that I know of but I have noticed when having sex I have a hard time reaching orgasm. Does anyone else have this problem?? Otherwise to me it's a wonder drug that makes me feel normal and I love that!

212$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/24/2012 9:22:33 PM$Reviewer: jonathan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$highly effective. ONLY for occasional or short term use!  All benzos are highly addictive and effects will wear off requiring higher and higher dosages to maintain desired effects.  Anziety snd/or panic attacks will disapper immediately if you have never used benzos before.  Alcoholics or recovering acohol/drug addicts should only used under physician monitored dosage.  Exceedeing prescribed dosage will result in extreme sleepiness and further the development of addicton.  Withdrawal symptoms mild compared to aocohol or opiates, but if you stop abruptly you will feel highly agitated and will not be able to sleep for several days.  Very useful when needed but long term everyday use may cause more problems than origianl issue drug prescribed for.  Mixing with alcohol or other tranquilizers will cause euphoria followed by deep sleep and can be lethal.

219$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/29/2012 2:14:53 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been suffering from anxiety and panic disorder for a few months now. Primary care doctor tried a few different anti-depressants (Luvox, Wellbutrin, Zoloft...all generic forms) and I've had really bad side effects with them. He then suggested i see a psychopharmacologist(sp?), basically a psychiatrist who specializes in medications. After my first meeting with him he suggested Klonopin for my anxiety. Im to take that for a week, then when i go back, he wants to put me on a different anti-depressant to work hand in hand together.

After about 4 days of taking 0.5mg x2 a day, i have to say i can say that i feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I wouldn't say that i am a 100% cured, but i feel as if i am on the right track. Only side effect so far has been a feeling of tiredness, but I dont mind so much because i never slept well to begin with.

Overall, I'm happy with the medication, and i have a more positive outlook for the future."

222$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/12/2012 11:24:56 AM$Reviewer: Lina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$I was prescribed Klonopin after being on Xanax for 4 years (had been on it on and off for a total of 10 yrs) because it stopped working: no psychosomatic-- Xanax stopped working. Also, I was having horrible diarrhea;panic;depression especially the last 6th months. So I told my doc I had enough. When I stopped I did go through withdrawals (it was terrible!!) like for days but the doc gave me Klonopin to counter/replace the Xanax.  It's a odd feeling after being on something for so long and then not having the horrible Xanax side effects. I guess you can say it's surreal. But I think it's working. I am agoraphobic as well so we'll see how that works for me going to places. Oh and I really don't see how Klonopin makes you go to sleep...At all. I'm on Seroquel XR at bedtime and still can't go to sleep ( that med has not changed)?? I don't know maybe it's calming your attacks down to help you sleep? ;) Me, I can't sleep more than 2 hrs and that sucks:( Maybe my tolerance level's too high? Wish I could update progress but I guess you can't here. Good Luck

It has been hell for me, going back and forth w/my doses, attempting to decrease and then having to go back up again due to withdrawal side effects. And I always took the med as prescribed, no substance abuse! its just the way the med is. It is addicting physiologically. Be careful! And be aware that this medication and others like it (benzodiazepines) are best for short term use.

So far it seems to work pretty well. I'm not constantly worrying or on edge about everything and anything going on in my life. Sometimes the anxiety gets so bad that I would shake and cry uncontrollably. At the height of my anxiety, I would pace around the house and start cleaning or doing things to keep myself busy.

I also take Wellbutrin; the only anti-depressant specified for use with this sleep condition.  It does not work that well anymore.  I have recently tried lowering the dose while adding melatonin.  The first night I took 2.5mg plus 3mg melatonin, and somehow while asleep, I stood and fell hitting my head on the doorway.  I have lowered the klonopin to 2 taking 9mg of melatonin, and had horrible nights sleep with dreams, hallucinations, flailing, kicking, ect.  Went back to the 3 mg.  Last night I had dreams, talking, and hallucinations.  It is a terrible disorder.  I don't look forward to sleep, and am so tired most every day.  Wish I could find help.  I go to a noted sleep center....the Falk Clinic in Pittsburgh.  I also see a psychiatrist.  No one seems to know what to do about this.  It seems as though taking more Wellbutrin causes my mind to be overactive, so I am only taking 100mg. right now.  Not too depressed thankfully.  Anyone know about this and could advise help?

Came down with severe tinnitus, ring in the ears.  Could not sleep, maybe two a night and I was taking Ambien CR at the time. My Doctor recommended 0.5mg. and it work wonders. 8 to 10 hrs. sleep. Then I started waking up around 3:00 or 3:30am after being on this amount for 1yr. Tried a couple of times to get off this medication but couldn't do it. So I up it to 1mg. works great. Since I now have control over my tinnitus I want off this. I have tried 5 times to get off this and had real bad results. I have talked with my Doctors about getting off this and he said you need to slowly get off it. I have tried that with a chart that I would write down the amount each night, shaving a little each week then its gets to a point where I'm still on it maybe at .05 to .25 and get hardy any sleep at all for days and walk around like a zombie and just have to go back on it.

My doctor started me on a very small dose of Klonopin, and immediately it changed everything. I feel normal. I can sleep. No more panic attacks. I can think about my upcoming cancer operation without the fear I used to have. I can think and act rationally now without it having affected me or my personality at all. I don't feel tired or ""druggy"", I just feel more in control of my emotions and thoughts now. Some people have side affects, but I haven't experienced any at all. If you are having panic attacks, don't be afraid to let your doctor prescribe it for you.  For me, it's been a wonderful drug that has allowed me to face life with more confidence and less upset."

They do increase with stress and Klonopin causes sexual problems including ED.  However other ED medications, both RX and especially certain herbal found on 'Better Sex Mall' conteract the sexual side affects.  I change dosage between 1 to 2 mg per day and occasionally discontinue for short times without any withdrawal or rebound.  For me all of the side effects expounded have not been a problem.  I have had Tourette syndrome since age 9 or 10 and I'm now 71.  This has been a miracle drug for me and should be given a good try under a physician's care before dismissing it because of all the warnings and expressed side effects.  I am not addicted to it even after 25 years of use.

Within a month, it stopped working.  I built a tolerance to the drug.  What I DID not know was that the drug is HIGHLY physically addictive.  I spoke to a Neurologist who told me that is as addictive as heroin or alcohol.  She told me that it is VERY dangerous to withdraw from Klonopin suddenly. She gave me a slow taper schedule, but it was VERY difficult.  I experienced tremors, nausea, and sweats during the withdrawal period.  After the last does, it took 35 hours to completely leave my system...and the anxiety came back with a vengeance.  This drug should only be used for a very short time.  In my opinion, Klonopin should have a black box warning on the label.

I swore I would never be like that. I thought she should just get over it and I was a little embarrassed by her ""illness."" But one day I was driving with my two children in the car, and out of the blue I had this sense of impending doom, my heart was slamming in my chest, and I was terrified that I would die behind the wheel and my children would die in a subsequent car crash.  I went to see a doctor who, luckily, had some training in the signs of hormonal imbalance and a LOT more compassion than I showed my mom.  I was diagnosed as being peri-menopausal. Klonopin was the first stop-gap for me - it saved me from becoming a prisoner in my home, as my mom had been.  It also helped me help HER discover that this was a medical disorder, not a mental one.(I still feel guilty for how I treated her.)  That helped HER find help as well. I was off Klonipin for years, and started taking it again after breast cancer. Unfortunately I am now on a drug that robs me of estrogen for life)and low estrogen was my problem in the beginning. Having to deal with hot flashes and panic again, my doc put me on up to .5 mg per day (half pill as needed). I don't take it every day - the problem seems to follow a monthly calendar. But when I do take it, I'm able to get on with life: no drowsiness, no drugged-up feeling. The doc did try anti-depressants which actually increased my symptoms - which, he said, didn't surprise him. This medication is my rescue, not my daily regime. I resisted taking it even as often as I currently do, but he said I am not refilling my script half as often as I am allowed, so he said I need to think of this in terms of being a rescue companion to the drug that keeps me from having breast cancer again.

I am hoping that I can be clean off this drug in 4-5 months. For folks who need it fine, but if you can relax another way please stay awy from this very addictive drug. It is far too easy to get and darn tough to stop. I am also going to try GABA (gamma amino benzoic acid) and 5-HTP at night to help. Any Benzo is very addictive and potentially dangerous, seizures and feeling horrific, plus you might end up in an E.R. Use extreme caution. Frankly I do not know why people like Xanax so much, it does little for me except keep me addicted. I'll keep you posted as to how the Klonopin wafers work. I will win this battle, period!

326$Condition: Other$1/3/2011 4:54:55 PM$Reviewer: Copperredgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I started taking Klonopin for anxiety. I had previously been taking Ambien to help me sleep, but as time went by I found myself taking a half an ambien through out the day to ease my anxiety. It seemed the more ambien I took, the more I needed. This had to stop for many reasons and I tried several other sleeping aids in it's place. Nothing worked like ambien and that's when I realized that maybe I don't have a sleeping disorder but suffer from chronic anxiety. Not panic attacks, just anxiety. Anxiety was keeping me awake, not letting me relax and it was general anxiety not related to phobias or circumstance. Anxiety was always just there, mentally paralyzing sometimes (I'd set on the couch for hours worrying and feeling I couldn't move from the spot I sat in)  I made bad decisions, and I was in general angry most of the time. The side effects I experienced from taking Klonopin were sometimes humorous. My friends while speaking to me on the phone told me I sounded drunk. My speech was slower. (I got hassled my entire life for talking to fast) They said I wasn't slurring, just talking slower. A couple of other friends claimed my personality was different and they missed the frazzled, high energy, always spoke my mind if appropriate or not. Changes I have experienced with Klonopin I am thrilled about are: I have more patients in general, I feel relaxed, I have control in focusing on what I need to get done from bill paying to washing the dishes. With Adderal alone I focused on anything in front of me, avoided anything I disliked doing and was often late for work etc.. Taking Klonopin with Aderall has changed my day to day life in the way I want it.... I'm positive and I'm confident there is a solution for most problems. I've never felt that way before. I used to feel trapped when problems came up. Side effects I do not like is my equal Librium is off. Walking in a straight line is dificult sometimes and I am bumbing into people and things from lack of awareness.

She is a physiciatric NP. She put me on Klonopin .5mg am/bedtime and she is weaing me off Paxil to the Zoloft. Let's just say I went from histeria on Tuesday morning to calmness upon waking this morning. I am sleeping well also. I expect to be on Klonopin until I am well on Zoloft and then taper off. If you take yourself off of Klonopin by yourself cold turkey of course your going to feeling it. Make sure you are with a physciatrist who knows meds and there side effects and how they will react with you personally. Good luck with everyone else out there, I know it stinks being on medicine but, at least we have these options.

Once around 10 a.m. before morning classes and once at night around 8 p.m. to relax for the day. I function fine and do not feel like a zombie as others explained. I am able to run 9 miles a week and do 13 hour days of school combined with HW. You want to know how it feels to feel like a zombie than try an antipsychotic med. They will put you on your ... I am able to concentrate in college MBA feel normal and actually am the social me I remember as a kid. I love this med and think it is a miracle. One day I will go off, but for now with all the stress and anxiety from college again it def. helps. I also, take 20 mg. of Prozac and believe this to be the perfect coctail. And, believe me, I have tried every med and type from antidepressants to antipsychotics. This works best for me in my experience with meds for 10 years. Hope this helped.

I was on the .5mg klono for about a month when my Dr. realized I still didn't leave my house for fear of crowds and people he upped my dosage to 1mg 1 1/2 3x's a day. Which was ALOT! I felt like a zombie. So I take 1 1/2 once a day only when I have to venture outside. If I'm going to work I'm ok it's just the rest of the outside world that scares me lol. But I can say when I do have to go out this med works well. I remain calm and don't rush to get out of the store to get back to my car aka safe zone. People being behind me in lines makes me want to harm people sad but true. The symbyax works good for that. ( the violent streaks I have on others ) So and all I recommend this med to anyone who has anxiety. If you don't feel like it's working on the first dose talk to your doctor.

I was put on it after having been given a steroid drug post partum to treat a rash. The steroid combined with my post partum state sent my adrenaline out of control and cause anxiety and insomnia. I am seeing one of the top psychiatrists in my city on the subject of anxiety/post partum. This drug has worked well and worked immediately. I mainly wanted to post this because it seems that there is some confusion on here about how to wean. My instructions were to wean myself (as long as I am not having any problems with sleep or anxiety) by a quarter of a tablet (.5mg tablet) not more frequently than every 3 weeks. That is a very SLOW taper. If anyone is on this, make sure you listen to your medical provider on the taper and I doubt you will experience these withdrawal symptoms that some have written. I was taking 3 tablets (1.5 mg) 4 months ago and am now down to 2.25 tablets. That is only dosing myself down by 3 quarters of a tablet in 4 months. This is how to be safe about it. Just be patient and try not to freak out that you are taking this medication. It is just for a season of life and it will end. Be patient.

What a difference (for me) I was taking 6 mg. of Xanax, I needed an increase frequently. The Klonopin works all day, I take 1 mg in the morning and one at bedtime. It does leave me a little tired in the morning, But I feel like I have my life back. All drugs of this nature are addictive. I just don't have that paniky feeling if I am running low or leave the house without it. For me..... It's been a miracle! But, we all react differently to any drugs....

I was literally on the edge of suicide because of the constant and uncontrollable pain this put me through.  I was taking Valium before I got pregnant but after my son was born, it wasn't working the way it did before.  After many ER visits, the doctor on staff that night recognized my problem and prescribed me Klonopin along with Amitriptilene- to take a night - and since then I have had no migraines and feel like a NORMAL person again.  I feel so overwhelmingly grateful for this drug.  When I first started taking it it made me a little tired during the day but it's been several months now and I feel great.  I only take .5mg twice daily and it doesn't work acutely like Xanex, but I no longer need the acute drugs like I used to.  The best part about Klonopin is that it isn't addictive like Xanex and I only have to take it twice a day to feel calm and about to focus on my son and our needs instead of having panic attacks all day long.

I have tried about everything out there and I promise Klonopin is the best thing to keep your anxiety at bay.  My dosage is 1mg 3 times a day.  You have to take them, even if you don't feel nervous to make sure they stay in your system.  I had to learn that from experience.  These don't work as fast as xanax to ""calm"" you, but they last longer and if you take them correctly you will feel like a ""normal"" person again.  I don't feel tired or groggy at all.  As a matter of fact, I can't tell I'm on any medication  I just don't feel nervous anymore-and isn't that the goal!!

I started getting them at 23 yrs old. Beforehand, I didn't even know there was such a thing! I thought I was having a heart attack (other panic-disorder sufferers know what I mean!) So, for YEARS, I would have an attack w/out any outside trigger or reason. I stopped drinking coffee, alcohol, and even thought that I was causing them from eating high-fat foods!! I had no clue. I tried all the Vitamins, minerals, herbs (esp. Kava, and Valerian) commonly recommended for anxiety; minimal to no relief! Tried dieting, exercise, meditating, even candles and soothing Music! NOTHING, nada and zip! Then, at 28, I finally had medical benefits, and saw a psychiatrist. Long story short: I was prescribed Clonazepam .5mg twice daily for my dreadful high anxiety. (I was also prescribed Adderall for ADHD and Remeron for Insomnia). Within 1 hr, I felt so much CALMER, RELAXED, MELLOW, and slept like a baby the FIRST DAY! Virtually no side effects either; just a little drowsy and sleepy the first 3 or 4 days. ZERO PANIC ATTACKS! I researched Clonazepam thoroughly and am well aware of all the bad rap it has got: Abuse, withdrawal syndrome, dependence, etc. Everyone's inner-chemistry is like a box of chocolates: You never know.. blah blah! Trial and error; works for some, paradoxical anxiety for only 1% of patients, the 'o-my-god-I-have-to-take pills' 'phoebes that try to stop taking the very solution that works....Duh! Yet, I know it doesn't work for everyone (they can have my Valerian--it's gathering dust!) Bottom line: Communicate w your Doctor!! And, If Clonazepam works, it works! Period! I've been taking it for well over a year, and I have FINALLY completed TWO COLLEGE SEMESTERS! 4.0 GPA! How's that for a 'side effect' of an anxiety-treatment plan? I rest my case. Clonazepam (and Remeron) has really helped me live a more productive life free of debilitating panic, insomnia, and anxiety! I even stopped drinking! Just beautiful.
394$Condition: Other$6/26/2010 8:08:08 PM$Reviewer: malcharpac, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Ive been having anxiety issues for a couple of years since ive had my son and he started getting into things.  I tried zoloft before this drug and my husband and I both noticed the difference.  Im on 0.5mg twice a day if needed.  So far ive only had to take it once every other day.  My body is very sensitive to medicine so the doc started me on a low dose.  I dont know if its adictive but the way i see it is if it helps me deal with everyday things and my 3 and 2 year old grow up knowing that mommie loves them and is okay, then its worth it.  Both of my kids are a handfull and i didnt have anxiety this bad until after i had my son.  Id rather be on medicine to deal with my energetic kids than put them on it.  And the good thing is that now my world isn't upside down.  Sometimes we have no choice but to take medicine.  As much as I hate taking medicine I LOVE MY KIDS MORE.

This is coming from personal experience.  I have wanted to die when I tried tapering off.  Another thing to be AWARE of is that the SSRI and SNRI pharmacutical companies may claim they are not habit forming - WRONG - just as hard to quit. Of course everybody will respond differently, but my honest opinion is if you need help only use meds minimaly and look for other methods, such as therapy, excercise, yoga, etc.  I am not a doctor nor claim to be a medical expert.  I just have personal experiencs and have done exstensive research regarding these meds.  If they change brain chemistry - most likely there will be fairly severe side effects when deciding to quit.  I hope that helps.

But I also notice that whenever I take it, my mood improves considerably with just one dose, my anxiety decreases, and I'm actually able to relax for once and not feel like the world is suffocating me and everyone hates me. I battle depression, along with anxiety/panic attacks, and fibromyalgia/rheumatoid arthritis. It's a lot for a 25 year old to deal with sometimes along with the pressures of the outside world. I just wish I still had insurance so I could get a prescription for it and really try it out. It may be just what I need to turn my life around. I'm always in pain, I feel hopeless, I'm scared of interacting with people (even on the phone), I feel like nothing is ever going to work out and and everyone is talking about me behind my back and hates me. I feel like I'll never find a job, or I won't be able to do anything right and get fired. I'm a failure. I'm worried I'll never be good enough to date, marry, or be a mother. I stress out how I'm to going be able to pay back student loans. I feel like my family thinks I'm a loser. I worry about death all the time, my death and losing all the people I care about in my life one by one and not being able to cope with the crushing sadness. I'm afraid to drive because I can't trust the other drivers on the road and I'm afraid they'll hurt me. I'm scared of getting too close to anyone because I feel like if they go away or hurt me, I'm not going to trust anymore. I eat for comfort when I'm nervous, scared, or upset. I chew the insides of my mouth and I pick at my head until it's raw. I let things build up inside me so much that when I reach the breaking point I explode into a fit of rage/depression because I'm not allowed to say what I really feel. I want to do so much with my life but I'm scared and I don't know how to start I don't feel like I'm good enough. Will it work?

I went through phases were I was so anxious I couldn't stop pacing or driving around aimlessly, focus on any work and sometimes I felt like I had a heart attack.  I even went to the E.R. on more than one occasion. (They told me it was, indeed, just anxiety and there was nothing wrong with my heart).  
Just 1 mg of this drug has done wonders for me.  It's also a definite plus that it lasts for 6-8 hours, because than I can rest assured that it will help keep anxiety at bay for  a long time.  I've had Ativan perscriptions in the past and, although it's effective, it doesn't last very long.  If you need a medication for long term use, according to my Dr., Klonopin is less addicting because it lasts for longer so you don't ever feel as if you need to take another one after only 3 hours (hence you do not get a high tolerence, etc).
I have never experienced any depression with this drug, which is significant considering I have certainly suffered from depression in the past.  
Hopefully this helps.  Although you never want to be totally reliant on this drug, when taken occasionally for panic/ anxiety it has helped me maintain an active, healthy and normal lifestyle.  "

My doctor prescribed this drug to help me sleep and it has worked wonders. I take it and wake feeling well rested.

But aside from that this medication has done exactly what I needed it to do.
449$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/26/2010 10:05:51 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$"Started out many moons ago on Xanax and talk therapy for panic attacks.  Stopped Xanax and then had to restart but at a higher dose to be effective.  Have been on the same dose of Klonopin (0.5 mg twice daily) for many years now.  Keeps panic disorder under control and tolerable as far as physical symptoms, constant doomsday thinking, etc. Klonopin is NOT helpful for specific phobias in my personal experience.

I have tried tapering off several times over the years but always go back to med because my body is highly habituated now.  In my opinion, would have to go to drug rehab to get off of it if I had to.

But I look at it similarly to a diabetic who needs insulin to maintain a normal life. If it helps me to live normally, why fight it?  I am just wondering what the long term use side effects will be.

This would NOT be a drug of choice for anyone with an addictive personality."

470$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/26/2010 3:04:56 AM$Reviewer: sarahbein, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$My doctor took me off Ativan because my new insurance didn't cover it and gave me Klonipin, saying it lasts longer than Ativan. I was on Ativan for seven years. The doc sd only take when needed. Well, one night I felt a big panic coming on slowly which meant it may last longer than usual. That was at 6 p.m., I took one as directed, even broke it in half. Forty-five minutes later, my panic was slowly increasing, and I was trying to control it. I looked at the directions on the bottle. My prescription was only for 0.5mg and my Ativan prescription was for 2 mg. Well, since it was now an hour later and my chest was constricting. So, I take another one and wait and hour, then another and wait an hour. Finally, after my fourth one, equaling 2mgs, it still wasn't working. I guess it is long acting because it takes so long to actually start working compared to Ativan. Eight and a half hours later, it started to work, at 230am. My doctor said take only if need be but this medication doesn't work that way for me. I cannot wait 8.5 hours for a Panic Pill to work! That isn't a help, Ativan works faster, now that I only take when I need because I don't want to be carrying around my liver or kidneys in a cooler when and if I reach 80 yrs. old. I have a doctor appointment soon and boy are we going to go rounds about this! I have a life to live in the meantime between panic attacks, so I am getting my Ativan back.

508$Condition: Other$11/21/2009 4:48:32 PM$Reviewer: Bcareful, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$5$"Personally, I've never been ""prescribed"" this drug.  My ex-GF was on Crackopin, along with a variety of other drugs such as lithium, Zyprexa, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Lexapro and a variety of other drugs to treat symptoms of bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety/panic attacks.  

At first, she wasn't on these meds (she was on them previously, but went off for a while).  She went back on, and completely changed over to a different and doped up person.  I realized after a while that she has problems that I couldn't understand, and that perhaps she needed these meds to cope (I'm not a psychiatrist, so I don't know).

Anyway, she was put on certain drugs, she was taken off those drugs if they didn't work, and then she was put on a different combination of drugs to see how that worked.  It appeared that her doctor was playing guinea pig with her, putting her on so many different drugs she was always totally doped up. 

Now, don't take this review as an expert opinion.  Just take it as an opinion of someone who has witnessed second hand the effects of these kind of drugs.  At one point, I took 10 mg of Klonopin and man, I can say it is overwhelming.  I would never do it again.  My GF convinced my friend to try to take a 10mg, and he was all whacked out for 24 hours.  He woke up the next day and was still all messed up.

In conclusion, be very careful when going on these drugs.  They develop dependency and I would want someone else to get into this mess unless it is an absolute necessity.  Question your doctor thoroughly if considering getting on any of these types of drugs."

I took Clonasopham (Klonopin) to deal with pain in my lower legs that keep me awake at night.  It worked wonders and kept my restlessness down.

I developed muscle twitches at bedtime, which interfered with my sleep. This medication was not prescribed correctly. As I found out this September 2009 from an addiction specialist, medications in this class are meant for short-term use only. Looking back, I can see that many of my physical problems and memory issues over the last few years were a result of Klonopin, but the problems didn't really start until last year when I developed tolerance withdrawal. Now I am off of it completely. Please google this drug before you agree to take it beyond two weeks. It has stolen 5 years from me. There are reasons why so many people seem so dramatic online. Think about why they're saying it.

In my opinion, it is given out to easily, prescribed at high doses for too long at a time, and is highly addictive if used for most two weeks. I've been going through withdrawal for weeks and it is only the beginning of what I will endure. Just watch the videos on Youtube or Google Klonopin Withdrawal and you will be horrified. I have suffered just about all of the things that they say ""may"" happen, including losing complete feeling in my lower body for 6 hours and flailing all over the place. They thought I was seizing and having a stroke. People, DO NOT GO ON THIS MED OR ANY BENZODIAZAPINE! I have never used drugs in my life; not even weed. And I am addicted to what I consider the worst family of drugs there is. You can't go to detox as you can't stop cold turkey. It is a process that can take years. My life has been so effected by this. I've lost communication with my children and have developed agoraphobia from this. I don't have a life. I am alone. It sucks. Oh, I have beautiful to my waist hair and it is falling out. So tell me, WHY are doctors allowed to hand this stuff out like candy? I didn't know it was even addictive as both of my doctors told me that stopping it was ""no big deal"", AND I BELIEVED THEM. I realized I was no longer anxious and decided to stop....that is when the hell began and I almost died. Thank you for reading. "

So if you start this medication, make sure you have a back up plan, because if you don't, you can find yourself in a world of hurt. And worse yet, you start becoming unstable again and if like me, other drugs are unable to be taken, well, what can you do.  It's not like good people want to take potentially addictive drugs, the other drugs worked, not without the ""life endangering"" side effects though. It would be great to take them, but I can't. Till then, I'm struggling to find a doctor to get my medication, (Klonopin), which has been working well for years.  If you're not a drug addict, this drug is a life saver."

Originaly the neurologist decided since they weren't as serious as they could be just to have me monitor them and if the seizures continue to go back and see him about anti-seizure meds which he didn't want me on due to side effects. About a year later I noticed I had severe panic attacks that led me to convulse so I went to E.R. which they thought the episodes were caused from anxiety so they prescribed me xanax. Been there, done that, and all that is is an addictive habit and a way to put you to sleep. It was my family doctor who suggested Clonzepam/Klonipin 1 mg. per day. And it worked great! However, as any meds go you get immune to them and now I take 2 mgs. 3 times daily which I also came immune to so I figured I would  take them as needed so I didn't have to rely on them at all times and they work better when I start to feel as if I'm going into panic mode. Needless to say, they are great but could always go up on mgs. for us who cant feel them anymore.

I used to take 2 mgs every morning and every nite.  Now I only take 0.5 mgs as needed.   There are certain circumstances that increase my anxiety, and I have to take my med, other than that I can go without it.  I believe that if you need to take a med to have a normal life, go for it.  If people want to describe it as an addiction, then, so what, as long as it improves my quality of life, I wouldn't care that much.

THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH PANIC ATTACKS IS TO DEAL WITH THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A PANIC ATTACK. ALLOT OF PEOPLE WILL WORK THEMSELVES INTO A PANIC ATTACK BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT A PANIC ATTAK. THE MORE YOU THINK ABOUT THEM THE MORE PANIC ATTACKS YOU WILL ACTUALLY HAVE.

After trying without success to get sleep with Neurontin and other meds, klonopin was the best for me.  Getting to sleep with RSL and neuropathy is a miserable experience and I almost went crazy not getting sleep.  Now I take 1mg. at bedtime and fall asleep and sleep most of the night.  Occasionally, if my symtoms are bad because of bad sugar control, I may have to take a prescribed Talwin to be able to sleep without kicking my legs.  I am very careful not to do this often so my AC1 level is okay when checked every three months.  But, as every diabetic knows, there are times of illness, tension or unwise food decisions that can cause neuropathy to be worse.  But the Restless Leg Syndrone is very bad on occasions and only the klonopin works for me.  I have sleep apnea and am very careful to follow my doctor's orders and use my CPAP as directed.  To sum up, yes, klonopin works for me and if it helps keep me from having panic attacks, great.  I am not anxious about using it as long as I have to right blood tests to keep check on my liver, etc.  Sleep deprivation can be miserable and dangerous.  I am so glad I have a doctor that helped me find something that allows me to sleep.  My mother has used it for many years and it has been very beneficial for her.  I ""am"" my mother's daughter!"

569$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/24/2009 10:54:44 AM$Reviewer: imaginethat, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$Definitely an effective med for anxiety.  It really helps me focus.  Also significantly reduces my frequent onslaught of overwhelming brain activity that keeps me distracted and unable to focus.  I recently started back on Klonopin after being off for several years.  The only downside is the addictive aspect of this drug.  It is extremely important that you wean yourself off very slowly.  The manufacturer recommends reducing your dose .125 every 3 days.  I would follow that advice if at all possible.  When I was on it before, I just stopped taking it, and was almost hospitilized...having some of the worst out-of-body feelings and physical ailments I've ever felt.  Be careful when stopping use!!!

Without it, I'm sure that I would have committed suicide.  After the Zoloft ""kicked in,"" I had no need for the Klonopin anymore, and had no withdrawl problems or side affects at all.

It is so addictive it is the only drug besides alcohol that can actually kill you if you stop taking it without a doctor supervising.
This can mean that some people who have never abused drugs can end up in a detox center if they have been on a high dose for a lot of years. I do not understand why the drug companies have not found something as effective without the deadly side effects.  It's pretty sad that heroin, cocaine, meth, all illegal drugs do not have the risk of killing you while detoxing but something legal and prescribed does. I do believe there are many people who really need these types of medications but I also believe they are overperscribed as an easy fix to panic attacks. They should be a last resort only and doctors should tell the patients how highly addictive and deadly they can be.  I have honestly seen it ruin lives, and I will honestly admit for all my anger against benzo-diazapans I am still afraid of being off it.I would recommend people to try DBT therapy, it has helped me and I plan on continuing it to help me cope, your phychotherapist/counsler should be able to do this for you. In DBT, patients are not told that their feelings are wrong, but rather that they need to find a more positive way to manage them,They learn mindfulness,stepping back and being conscious of the moment without judging it as good or bad, and other emotion regulating skills, so that their feelings have less influence on their behavior.
They also learn distress tolerance,coping with situations as they are -- and methods of self-soothing and distraction. It has worked wonders for me!"

For the first month being off klonopin, I was fine...then, w/out any warning my anxiety came back even worse than before. It was so bad, I couldn't sleep, couldn't breath, and was feeling extremely moody and even suicidal. Since I've been back on the meds, things are better but now I only take maybe 2 per day and try not to take any before bed since when I do, I feel totally useless the next day. I don't want to wake up and worse...get out of bed. If I take them during the day, my mood stabilizes somewhat and I can make myself get things done that I need to.

The medication has worked fairly well for both conditions, and the only side effect is mild sedation when I take it midday.  My nightly higher dose (2mg) helps me sleep (and keep in one place during dreams!!), so I don't have any criticism of it for that usage."

I went to go see a doctor (an MD by the way) he told me there was nothing wrong w/ my heart, and of course because my age he told me that those feelings I get didn't have to do with the heart. He assumed that I have a Panic disorder/ Generalized Anxiety. So he referred me to a Pshychiatrist, she diagnosed me and so ironic it was what the doctor assumed. My Pshychiatrist started me on Anti-depressants, and all the above. I went through a whole lot of medications till my Pshyc said ""I'm going to try you on a class of medications called Benzodiazepines"" he explained everything about benzos. So he started me on Klonopin .5 it work ""arlight"" for me. Still couldn't sleep and I was still getting panic attacks here and there. So he increased the Milligrams, from .5 to 1MG. Now I started sleeping like a normal person that has no sleeping disorders, and my panic attacks were supressed. I mean I still got them but they weren't as severe and sometimes I would feel like i'd get one but for what ever the medicine chemistry reason it blocked the panic/ anxiety attack. I say Klonopin is the right medication for Panic/ Sleeping and Generalized anxieties. But like they say ""Different strokes for different folks"" wouldn't hurt to give a low dose of Klonopin a try, if it does its job then perfect, you got yourself a good treatmeant for your Panic/ sleeping disorders... Klonopin is GREAT! By the way (BTW) Iam still on 1mg and it's still working fine for me, though I haven't tried to ween myself off of them, anyone has any suggestions on getting off Clonazepams?
I am very Satisfied."

Xanax would stop the attack almost immediately. But a new Dr. (I moved) put me on this hot mess and I was on it for approx. 12 years. Had PA on it anyway and barely took care of my anxiety. Gradual withdrawing after 6 wks. left me still needing .5 mg a day (was taking 1 mg 3x day. 
Also, it slowed my motivation to do much of anything greatly. Xanax is fast acting and fast leaving while Klonopin is slow acting and slow to leave body. Pretty much back just on Xanax now...not enough $$$ to get me dependent on klonopin again. Besides, I'm allergic to aspirin, Nsaids, etc. so if a Xanax doesn't stop an attack, I know I'd better get to a hospital quick. Klonopin didn't give me that option."

Over time, it seems that I actually have needed less and less of it - I don't even take it every night now and I don't feel any withdrawl type symptoms if I don't take it for a few days, but I wouldn't want to be completely without it. It works wonders when anxiety symptoms pop up unexpectedly and thankfully my anxiety tends to come at night anyway - so it has been a good drug for me. No other side effects except sleepiness.

Of course I am on other meds, Cymbalta, Vicodin(Norco), Lyrica & now Klonopin. With this combination of meds, I finally have found a level of relief that has allowed me to function normally. 
Although at first the Klonopin for the first few days did cause morning fog, but didn't last long. I stayed groggy about 30 mins after waking, but I just took it slow. 
Another thing I do is NEVER take this during the daytime, unless I have no plans on going out. 
This will make you drowsy & a little clumsy until after you get used to it.
I have been prescribed 3 times daily, but I feel even at the lowest dose of .5 mg that is too much. So I stick with taking it at bedtime.

However in general it eases anxiety without giving me that ""high"" feeling.  It makes it so I'm able to function normally and it just takes the edge off.  Nobody would look at me and think I'm doped up.  So yes it works but its hard to manage the dosage because doctors hesitate to increase the dose of benzos, despite the fact that they really do create tolerance, and they are so helpful to people who don't abuse them, so I don't see why a dosage increase wouldn't be agreed upon.

I initially was started on 0.5mg 2x a day every day for a year and then started taking Lexapro with it.  I continued to take the Clonazepam for another year with the lexapro then decided to wean myself of the clonazepam and just take in on an as needed basis.  It works wonderful for a ""PRN"" (as needed) drug.  I probably take it once or twice every two months and during those times I will take it for 3 or 4 days and then stop and go about my routine till I feel the need for it again.  My anxiety has been greatly under control, it's just every once in a while it creeps up on you and you feel like you can't function.  It's these instances when clonazepam works wonders.  I hope this helps all those with anxiety issues.  I would not recommend this drug on a ""full-time"" basis.  I think it is a great drug to be used in conjunction with another SSRI or SNRI until one that is found that works.  Once the SSRI or SNRI is found to work, the person should wean themselves off this med and then just use it as an as needed medication."

I have always dealt with chronic panic attacks (15 years or so). I have been prescribed every antidepressant imaginable and nothing worked because I am not depressed. I have extremely high anxiety and panic disorder. Klonopin has helped me so much. I used to not even be able to function at work or even in public due to panic attacks and I am fine now. I have had only a couple of mild attacks in 2 yrs. I recently went to my doc for a follow up and I told her I wanted to decrease my dosage to .25 from .50 and I tried .25 for 2 weeks and couldn't handle the decrease so I went back to .50. I am a troubled sleeper due to high anxiety and I went 2 weeks on little to no sleep. Klonpin is great for insomnia. Doc says if I am ok at .50 I should stay there. I don't want to become physically dependant on this drug to function, but it has helped so much with panic and anxiety. I have no side effects and have never had to increase my dose in 2 yrs. I have always taken .50 1X per day. I'm going to try to decrease to .25mg again and see if I can get past the effects. Overall, I highly recommend this drug over vallium and xanex. I can function fine after taking it and feel great after a full night's sleep.

Now before this I couldn't even get out of bed, I was shaking so bad inside and had a feeling of fear constantly.  I was on sick leave from work for almost 6 months.  After the doctor gave me Klonopin, I felt normal again the next day.  I was sooo happy!  I've been on it for 3 years now and it still works like it did before.

I have been on this medication for a little over 3 months currently I am taking .5mg. I have had to see a cardiologist several times, not sure if this is doing something bad to my heart. I still have panic attacks even on the medication. I have read all the side effects and I wish I would of did this before trying this medication. My doctor wants me to use paxil I am worried about that medication also. I am reading so many positive feedbacks about Klonopin and wish that was me. When I drive I feel weird also like I am drifting off to another place. I am to the point I fear driving. I also fear being alone thats how bad my panic attacks are. But while I am taking my Klonopin I am very mean and evil. To the point that I dislike everyone around me. I thought for sure that this medication would help me. But I think the medication is doing more harm then good for me. I am praying that my Doctor can help me taper off this medication so that the side effects are not as bad as I have read about. I am scared out of my mind that the side effects are going to be bad.

Both work very well for panic attacks. But, Klonopin 1mg is my favorite because it does not make you as drowsy (like valium) and last for a long time (unlike xanax). I can function normally during the day if I need to take one or even two if needed. Has kind of mild mint taste to it if you bite one in half. Even, helps with depression. I found it better than antidepressants, but it is hard to convince a doctor that. Very habit forming though! No cold turkey if you need to stop!

Helpful for a while, but, in time, found anxiety was increasing.  (Have read up on this medication and found this is common.)  The difficult part was STOPPING the medication.  In a word - HORRIFIC!!! I tapered off with my doctor's schedule, very carefully. I NEVER abused the medication, took .5 mg 3xday as prescribed - but when I stopped it, I went through the most horrific withdrawal ever.  21 days of constant, debilitating anxiety - and I had NEVER had a panic attack before!  In my opinion, you can become addicted to this drug WITHOUT abusing it --the physical and emotional withdrawal was evidence of it.  I see this drug as POISON now - I would NEVER take it again.

I inherited this disorder and know that it will always be in my life, it's something I just have to deal with. I have had panic attacks for 27 yrs, but have only been on Klonopin for 13 yrs.

It was selected by my (former) psychiatrist because it was thought to be the least addictive. It was somewhat effective, and I did like the fact that it has a long half-life, staying in the system for a long time. However, I did not feel the same relief from anxiety and tension I felt with some other medicines in this same class. Perhaps I wasn't taking enough -- I was only able to inch up to 2.75 mg./day, as if I were taking morphine or something...

That is what they get paid the big bucks for.  If you feel as though your doctor is not treating you in the manner that you feel is appropriate for your situation, then find a second opinion.  I have been battling this for over 10 years now and I have just recently found the right doctor that actually listens to what I tell him is wrong and how my medications make me feel and he takes the time to explain to me what I should be feeling and tells me to let him know if they dont go away.  The right doctor makes all the difference.

It really does help.  Only problem is, alot of change lately and 1/4 wasn't doing it, so I started taking 1/2 at a time when needed.  Now I try to go a day without any and I just can't, but 1/2 a day isn't too bad.  I'd like to think that once I get through my current stressors I'll be able to get back to 1/4 as needed.

This was extremely disturbing for me as I'd never had problems with sleep before.  Dr. prescribed 1mg 1 hr prior to bedtime; said it would help stop my mind from racing.  He was right!  I no longer need to take any sleep medication and I generally sleep the entire night through.  The only side effect that may or may not be related is that I sometimes have strange, disturbing dreams; however, they are not significant enough to warrant my tapering off of this medication.

But Klonopin caused, in me at least, after about 6 or 7 yrs on it from 1mg to .5mg to .25mg (finally off it now), a range of other ""paradoxical adverse reactions"".  Sex drive = increased to the point of sexually compulsive behavior.  Anger / irritability / rage level(s) = WAY up above where it should be...we're talking seriously potentially violent here, on at least a few occasions.  Depression; basically the Klonopin caused, in me, after being on it for so long,  just the typical symptoms of mild (or ""moderate"") depression to set in.  Physically, there was constipation, acne flares, and hair thinning/ loss after the prolonged usage.  This IS an effective drug for treating anxiety and panic,  yes, but,  for me at least,  after finally getting off of Klonopin it has proven much wiser for me to not use any ""benzodiazapenes"" on a daily basis & simply take a .25mg (or actually I usually crack those in half, so .125mg) of Xanax ""PRN""(as needed; that is, DURING, or to prevent, an actual severe panic attack).

The withdrawals have been horrible!!  They include psychosis, paranoia, rage, thought disorder, tremors, pain and some of the worst panic attacks that I have had.  So far I have been off of work on sick leave for a week and I have found a new Dr.

I strongly recommend against stopping this drug ""cold turkey"".  Since I have had some spare time I have learned that I haven't experienced the worst withdrawal effect of the drug which is seizures.  I feel like I am over the worst part of the witdrawals and I look forward to returning to work.

I started at .25 three times a day, then after a year, went down to .25 twice a day, and now I take .25 once a day.  Thank god for this drug!  I started having anxiety attacks two years ago, and have only had one in two years (and it was a situation that would cause anyone to feel anxious, so I wasn't too worried - did some Yoga and felt much better).  It worked from the first day I took it.  It works quickly, and for a longer period of time than Xanax and Ativan.  I'm taking Effexor XR as well for anxiety, and it's been a winning combination.  I'm weaning off the klonopin because it makes me sleepy, and the Effexor is working well, but I am really glad this drug was available when I started treatment.  I was really depressed when the attacks started, thinking I'd always be limited because of the fear of having an attack and this worked so well, within a week, I was back to my old self.  I will still take it on an as-needed basis for the occasional bout of anxiety.

Side Effects:  I was sometimes clumsy, fell a couple of times...shattered my kneecap, tripped up stairs and down.  Then I read it adds to Osteo. Am now exercising, eating healthy.  Doing my best to control any panic attacks that I feel may be coming on.  Of course, therapy during that time helped me...deep breathing, subtracting 3 from 100, walking, drinking water (this is during a panic attack.  I have only had the beginning of a couple panic attacks since.  Have been off for two years, now.  But you should have a therapist you can trust, who deals with panic disorder.

I'm hoping that the weaning process will go smoothly and my life may return to normal. This is a powerful drug that I feel I was exposed to needlessly.

I have slight jerks when I don't use and or when I was put on it. I just want to know which is true.  My condition started with head injuries; starting in 1965...since then I have had 5 injuries to my head...nothing to put me in the hospital butenough (Ithought) to cause me to lose my balance. I've gone to several Neourogists, had MRI and MRA but each Doctorwinds up doing the same thing...walk..scratch..do you feel that and continue taking Klonopin..I'm 77 in good shape excpt for my knees and my balance.  Is there a clinic or a GOOD DOCTOR here in Calif who I can go to that will help I now walk with a walker because of falling down,,,but around the house (unless I'm in a hurry) I use a cane.
Thanking you in advance.

I have not been on any medication in more a year and am glad to say I have not have any unpleasant side effects. Klonopin did work wonders for anxiety, BUT and this is a huge BUT. Was extremely addicted to this after being on it for a year. Was ""fired"" by my therapist and I went online to learn how to ween myself off of it. I recommend it for anxiety because it works but it's very addictive and made me very tired to the point I would just dose off to sleep. Felt like a junkie. NEVER stop this medication abrubtly.  And if I missed a dose would get the shakes. I emphasize that it does work extremely well but you will become ADDICTED to this medication so be mindful of this. I weened myself off of it SLOWLY and didn't experience any withdrawal symptoms.  I have changed my diet and only eat ORGANIC and whenever I get a little stressed I go the health food store.  They sell homepathic medicine that works just as well for my anxiety and sleepiness without the negative side effects. The organic diet help cut out the intense food cravings I was having. BUT never ever stop taking your medication unless you consult with your physican first.  I don't knock tradional medicine because it helped get me through my rough time when I got divorced and lost my home and everything else I valued and felt like I wanted to end it. I still have ""talk"" therapy and I would still use traditional medication if I need to but I felt I was on klonopin too long and shouldn't have been on it that long. And if it ever gets to point again I would defintely use if it I had to again.  God bless everyone one of you.  Having a mental illness is not easy but just know that it will get better and eventually the sun will come out again. If one medication doesn't help don't give keep trying until you find something that works for you.  Not all medications work the same for everyone but eventually you find something that works for you.  "

When it works, IT WORKS. However, It can make me a little bit nervous sometimes.

Ease of Use:

Yes, it's easy to use. All I do is pop the pill in my mouth and swallow...it's that easy.

It is just an even feeling that both helps my panic disoorder and helps with the manic side of Bipolar. I personally have not had depression increase of suicidal thoughts but have known people who have so talk to your doctor. Everypne is different and this is addictive so never just stop taking it. I had to once as a psychiatrist ""fired"" me and did not wean me down and I was amess for three months and could have died I was later told. I take 6mg per day. 3 doses of 2 mg.
