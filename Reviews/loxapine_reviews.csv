It allows me to function at a high level while maintaining my stability and I have not been hospitalized since I have been on this medication (2003).  Unfortunately, I was not able to completely stop the zyprexa I had been taking; I still need a small dose of 2.5mg of that as well.  But along with my mood stabilizer (lamictal) and my antidepressant(wellbutrin 
SR), I never dreamed I would be this stable.  I have some side effects, though nothing that bothersome.  I have occasional muscle twitches, which I choose to put up with rather than add yet another medication (like cogentin).  I am almost completely symptom free.  I have read that loxapine is very similar to clozapine, but doesn't cause as much weight gain or blood disorders.  Oh, that's another thing: I have been able to lose over 70 lbs since going on this drug and reducing the zyprexa.  I HIGHLY recommend this drug for schizophrenia or schizoaffective; I'm not sure why it's not prescribed more often.  I suspect it is almost as effective as clozapine."
