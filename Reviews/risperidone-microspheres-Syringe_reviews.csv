This isn't like when I have suicidal thought during a panic attack. I'm MORE hopeless & while I focus better for short periods I'm easier to agitate & all I want to do is eat, sleep & smoke. I will NEVER take this again.

4$Condition: Schizophrenia$10/20/2007 6:14:15 PM$Reviewer: Hey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$2$I have 4 times the highest normal range  level of  prolactin in my blood. I have significant decrease in libido and my semen seems to not be forming I'm not sure how that effects the sperm to have something to swim in when being released. I have a climax which is significantly diminished in the pleasure aspect of the ejaculation and coitis is decreased. I have decreased motivation two to three days after my shot. The intensity of my climax does vary. I seem to have no increase in blood sugar readings. I have orthostatic hypotension 3 to 4 days after the injection of the risperdone consta.I am prescribed 50mgs once every two weeks. I have been administered this dose for one year. I started this regimen in 2004 discontinued in 2005,started again in October 2006. I find when not eating adequatley and especially missing sleep I still have symptoms with the risperidone consta. I consume moderate amounts of coffee when not eating but if I eat I don't get symptoms. I hope to use diet to control symtoms and nutritional supplements as a buffer to diet. Vitamin C helps quite a bit. I find those professionals involved in my recovery are unwilling to use the diet and the nutritional supplement approach. I hope to  be free of the traditional medication because of the side effects and adverse reactions. It is frustrating that the traditional Doctors do not recommend alternative thearpy instead of traditional medicine. Look into alternative medicine there are many other approaches besides traditional medicine. I have faith in naturopathic Doctors. Not every naturopathic Doctor is as good as some, so don't be discouraged if at first you don't have success. It matters how smart and informed the Doctor is that you are seeking.
