CONTRAINDICATIONS
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
The concomitant use of Remeron Tablets and a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. Remeron should not be used within 14 days of initiating or discontinuing therapy with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) 
WARNINGS
Serotonin Syndrome
On rare occasions serotonin syndrome has occurred in association with treatment of Remeron tablets, particularly when given in combination with other serotonergic drugs. As serotonin syndrome may result in potentially life-threatening conditions, treatment with Remeron should be discontinued if patients develop a combination of symptoms possibly including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma, and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, Remeron should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan and oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in patients receiving other serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, lithium, tramadol, St. John’s wort, and most tricyclic antidepressants)
