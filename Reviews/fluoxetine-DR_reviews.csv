I got the feeling of drinking too much coffee right away. The coffee feeling went on and off, I also yawned too much after two weeks(40-50 times per day for 3-4 days). All of these went away after a month. I felt so good after, it seems I am a new person, not as tired as before not easy to get depressed or mad as before.
This medicine works perfectly for me."

I also began taking another drug because I still had feelings of anxiety.  The other drug is Citalopram.  I have noticed in the past 3 months, I am constantly yawning.  I read the side effects for both medications and they both seem to indicate this can be a side effect.  I am leaning toward the Citalopram however, since I don't recall having this issue before taking it.

I have been taking Fluoxetine for several years now, and for my depression, it has worked the best out of all of them. However, in the past 2 weeks I have weaned myself off the drug due to the side effects I have lived with for years. I am tired all the time, I get bad headaches, and have gained 30 pounds! I had vivid dreams which were sometimes disturbing, and had trouble falling asleep at night. It also decreased my libido immensely! BUT, if you are severely depressed I would highly recommend Fluoxetine over any of the others! But then again, everyone is different....

I no longer feel on the verge of crying about everything.  The only side effect I'm having are headaches and teeth and jaw pain. I'm afraid I will have to switch to something else if the jaw pain doesn't go away soon. Works extremely well for the depression though.

13$Condition: Depression$2/19/2015 8:45:41 AM$Reviewer: kc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking Fluoxetine for nearly 20 years. Increased my dosage one time about 5 years ago. It helps me keep my patience and keeps my anxiety in check.  It levels out my mood swings. I've tried to go off of it a few times.  It is clear within a few weeks that my patience and nerves are not good when I'm not taking it regularly.  The only side effect I've noticed is bad breath.  Occasionally it seems I have a hard time focusing, but I can't say that's the medicine for sure.  Others have mentioned low energy and sex drive but I've not had those issues at all.   Overall, it has been a real lifesaver for me.  I'll take the bad breath any day over the depression and anxiety.

It does have side effects that are pretty bad, but it was a trade I had to make. Sex life went to zero, loss of energy and low white blood cell count. the white blood cell count showed up as being in the very bottom of the normal range, I found later on the internet that it was a side effect. I had to inform my doctor as he did not know it.

Thus far, there has been no side effects or draw-backs and I don't foresee any at the present time. Also at this time my patient is using a very low-dose of the medication. I also don't know how long the physician may want my patient to be on the medication for his treatment period, or what type of results may be sought by the physician.

Then I noticed I had no emotion at all, no happiness, sadness, anything, I kept my cool even when some guy was trying to fight me, I barley even reacted.
I was on the lowest dose possible.
Then I also noticed my interest in girls faded drastically, I began to wonder how I even found them attractive, arousal was very hard to achieve as well, same with keeping an erection.
So today, I decided to not take it.
And you know what? I felt that attraction to girls come back, I even felt happier, easier to talk to my friends, just generally better, as if I never had depression or anxiety, although I can still feel some of my social anxiety.
I hear it's not a good idea to stop taking anti-depressants immediately, instead slowly take less and less...But I'm already taking the lowest dose!

I lived a nightmare the last three years my wife was prescribed. We went in it blind not realizing all the bad things this drug can do. minor deprssion look elsewhere. MD's are not informed as there are published and non published reports available. Even at that our Dr did not let us know even the known things to watch for. Libido is impaired on half of people on this, and I have been researching this for last 1.5 years. It is addictive contrary to what is reported. If this seems to far fetched that pharmacuetical companys would put out potentially harmful products. LSD was a prescription put out and prescribed for much of the same things Prozac is prescribed for, and works alot like present day SSRI's. The information is out there look it up. I lost my wife to this drug, her body is still there but her soul is gone. I stopped taking it personal after i learned why she is the way she is. The sad part I did not get the chance to say goodbye to the person I loved.

Many of these symptoms I have before the med, minus the headaches....which leaves me unable to function.

68$Condition: Depression$7/7/2011 10:56:16 AM$Reviewer: Amylein17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This is a follow up review for Celexa from July 2010, but I am currently on fluoxetine and review it further down. I took generic Celexa for 9-10 months. I gained about 10 pounds and was sleeping excessively. I would sleep 8 hours each night and still felt like I needed a nap every day. I went off this medicine to try ibuprpion to help me quit smoking. That was a failure-felt like a witch and it wasn't very effective at helping me stop smoking. After I went off ibupropion, I tried not taking any medicine, but rather supplements. I took 5HTP (for depression) and valerian root for anxiety for about a month. It helped a little, but not like AD medication. So I told my doctor I wanted something that made me feel like Celexa (happy, no worries, emotionally awesome), but that wouldn't make me hungry and sleepy all the time. She prescribed generic prozac which I've been taking for a little over a month. I really like it so far-normal appetitie, sleeping ok, and feel good emotionally. I have noticed a bit of vaginal tenderness/inflammation, but I presume that is happening due to decreased frequency of sex. Other reviewers of generic prozac have said they've noticed it as well. As with Celexa, my libido has decreased, but that has actually helped since my partner has a weaker than libido than I did before depression hit. Overall, I'm very satisfied with generic prozac. Will follow up in the future if anything changes.

I seem to be slightly happier but Dr. said it could take up to 5 weeks to feel the full effects. I don't like the fact that I can't sleep through the night at all. I usually wake up 3 or 4 times each night & that makes for a long day at work. I've also noticed some light-headed feelings at times and even a bit dizzy a couple of times. I'm willing to stick with it in order to get back to enjoying life again. Dr. said I'm in the early stages of depression. I just felt 'blah' most of the time even when things were going well. I just need some good sleep! God is good & I'll keep praying and living right & if it's in His will for me to get better then I will. One more thing I've noticed is when I actually do sleep I have very vivid dreams of things & people that I've long forgotten about. Early childhood things, school friends, family that's passed on...that's a bit odd for me.

I started on 20mg and eventually cut back to 10mg. I have taken Sarafem for almost 10 years. (I went off it only when I was expecting my third son.) Negative side effects were some weight gain and decreased libido, which is why I cut back to 10 mg and noticed some improvement. I do find it's harder to lose weight than before, so I exercise more and eat healthy most of the time.  I openly speak with others about my success with fluoxetine, as I think that meds to treat mental health sometimes get a bad rap. It ""smooths out my rough edges""... I am still me but more level-headed, calm, focused and happy.  Even after having a hysterectomy, (I still have my ovaries) I find it is a very effective medication for me. "

I noticed the same thing, however I was self medicating; deciding I only needed one 20 mg dose instead of 2 each day as the doc prescribed.  As long as I take fluoxetine as prescribed (20mg 2x a day), I'm fine and the depressing thoughts aren't with me.  The only consistent side effect is ringing in my ears.  Annoying, but not as devasting as depression.  I highly recommend this med.

I started out with 20mg and have been on it about 3 weeks.  I had HORRIBLE headaches for the first three weeks, but have been headache-free for the last 3 days.  I don't think the medicine has taken effect yet, but I'm trying to be patient because it can take up to 5 weeks to start working.  I'm hoping this happens sooner than later because, as most of you have probably experienced, I'm struggling just to get out of bed right now.  I just wanted to let my fellow headache-sufferers know that mine went away (thank God!) after about 3 weeks.  Hang in there!

Finally found one that works well. I've been prescribed 10mg of Fluoxetine daily (generic form of Prozac)for 6 months. However it has an overwelming side effect of involuntary jaw tightening & clenching. This side effect is not listed on the label and my doctor hasn't heard of this problem. My GYN suggested non generic stating it may contain purer ingredients, but $390 for 30 days w/insurance is not in the budget. I can only take 1 pill a week to minimize the side effect now, so it's not debilitating. Unfortunately I'm not getting the full benefit. I'd like to know if anyone out there has had a similar side effect and if they found a solution? Hate to stop fluoxetine since it works so well on depression."

Before i began taking it, it was difficult for me to do the normal things in life like get out of bed, be around friends and family etc.  Finally I talked to my doctor about the crying spells I was having were getting worse to the point I couldn't control them.  Then I became upset because others had seen me cry and it was only going down hill from there.  My doctor have me fluoxetine and I have been taking it everyday, soon I was feeling better and able to function in everyday life. now I feel so much better.  I have also found that it is very important to take it the same time everyday so that the medication will remain at a consist level in your system. Otherwise the results can be very bad.  Overall I am happy with the medication and how it is working for me.

I have been taking fluoxetine for about three years now and am currently on a dose of 60mg daily which for me is a wonder drug. It's funny because in one way I haven't changed (I'm still me) but in other ways I am a completely different person (happy!) Side effects I've had are weight gain and loss of libido, but to me they are a small price to pay. I was at the point I felt nothing would ever work and I had given up. This drug saved my life. My doctor reckons 60mg is too high as a maintenance dose and keeps trying to cut it back, but I always feel worse. She has asked me to try again and if it makes me feel bad this time I think I will change doctors!

I noticed a difference within the first week, and also during my cycle. I am not as irritable or easily aggitated, and I don't feel so depressed. The only side effects I seem to be experiencing are vivid dreams and I am now a light sleeper, when I could almost sleep through an earthquake before. I wake up just about every morning around 4:00am for no reason, but in most cases I'm able to go right back to sleep. Some days I also have an increased appetite, but I try to keep that under control by drinking a lot of water throughout the day. It does help. Other then that... So far, so good.

Can make a trustfull person into someone who is very distrustful and does not seem to care about anyone. Read and study about the non published reports about this drug before getting into this.

Today I'm back re-reading comments to see if others have some of the annoying symptoms I currently deal with.  Joint pain, morning headaches, a 25 pound weight gain and vaginal inflammation. I'm only on 10 mg, and don't feel that depressed, but having none of my clothes fit and just going from size 12 to 16, makes me fearful of where I'm going to go from here.  I'd rather be thin and depressed and look good in my clothes than be heavy and self conscious.  I'm going off the meds for now to lose the weight. I don't remember what other anti depressant made me gain weight, but I was in this same boat 2 years ago, and the weight came off quickly once I stopped the med.  Perhaps I'll just exercise a lot and hope the endorphins will kick in and soothe the depression.  I'll probably be writing again in 3 months saying I'm going back on the med, but for now I just want to lose this weight!

111$Condition: Depression$1/10/2010 10:46:15 PM$Reviewer: relaxmax, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$4$To begin with, it seems that I have been going through phases of depression for over 10 years since my mother became ill and I was her caregiver. Nonetheless, I never realized how strong the depression had a hold of my life and I simply excused the symptoms, believing that it would pass. Overtime, I noticed that I was unable to regain management over basic living functions, such as; paying bills, sleeping, exercising, regular house cleaning, etc. Now, I have recently shared more with my physician and he's determined that the sum of my problems originates from long-term depression combined with anxiety. It may seem premature; however, he prescribed me Fluoxetine and in only 3-days, I see a difference in my behavior. I'm beginning to care about and focus more on personal important matters. The only side-effect, thus far, are vivid dreams, nothing serious.  I recommend this medication as a starter treatment if medically possible. 
112$Condition: Depression$1/10/2010 3:24:45 PM$Reviewer: Jan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have tried several antidepressants, but this is the first to work well with little side effects.  Only on 10 mg for a couple months now, but feel so much better.  Used to be sad all the time and socially isolated myself.  Now I want to see people and go out more.  My problems began after a car accident (got rear ended) 6 years ago, when I began having back pain that still has not resolved, even after seeing some of the best physical therapists available and faithfully doing the exercises again and again.  I finally accepted that I would probably never be better and always be sad and in pain.  Even though the pain is not better, I am happy at least for a bit every day.  Doing exercise seems like a good idea again, even though it won't make me better, it will keep me from getting worse.  Side effects are: sleeping more, weight gain, vivid dreams, but other than that not bad.  I am so glad my pain Doctor recommended this drug.

I've been on it three years and it has been the best decision I ever made. For over a decade prior, there was thundering black cloud of negative energy in my head constantly interfering with my enjoyment of life.  The fluoxetine removed the black cloud and I don't worry about silly things anymore.  Side effects have been essentially non-existent, and it is very inexpensive. A brief experiment to reduce my dosage resulted in depressive symptoms returning, so I am happy to just stay on it for life.

I was out of control, and failed every one of my classes (but was still passed on because of ""psychiatric difficulties""), and had even yelled at a teacher (at which point, my thoughts made no sense and it came out gibberish).

I've been able to easily quit smoking (14 year habit) and have improved a stomach condition. I read recently that Serotonin also lives in your intestines, so I assume that Fluoxetine is helping relieve the pain and rapid, loose stools associated with my stomach issues. Overall, I am pleased with the results.

I had no energy and was overeating, which made me gain weight, which in turn added to my poor mood, and low self confidence. I slept whenever I wasn't working, had a short fuse with my step daughter and fiance... Since the drug started taking effect my energy level has increased 10 fold, I'm a much happier person, and it has given me the upper hand in my emotions... I control them, They do not control me. I feel better than I have in years. My only complaint which is relatively minor is that I've noticed ""jittery'ness"" I feel like I need to constantly be moving, sometimes its hard to concentrate, and falling asleep can be rough. But the smile on my fiances face when he realizes that I'm happy, and that the good days are far greater than the bad make any negative points seem pretty small!"

I am currently not taking it, but I am reconsidering changing my current medication back to Prozac due to cost and effectiveness.  Also the tolerability/effectiveness ratio was pretty good.  I miss the sense of confidence and 'well being' it gave me.  It's not perfect however, some of the down sides include: knocking out your libido, causing some jitterness, and mild apathy; but was very helpful for Depression, OCD and blocking panic attacks.  In fact Prozac didn't cause much weigh gain (compared to the other anti-depressants out there) and is FDA approved for many ailments not necessary related to depression. I have been on the standard strength for 7 years and it slowly loses its effectiveness over the years, but I slight raise in dose might help.  I went off to try Cymbalta and Lexapro and probably will return to the Prozac

169$Condition: Depression$5/20/2008 7:22:37 PM$Reviewer: anonymous, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking 20mg of Fluoxetine about a month and a half ago to try to get a hold of my depression. I have had depression on and off for probably 6-8 years or so (I am now 24). I've tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and another anti-depression medicine, but Fluoxetine seems to be helping me the best. Some of the other medications actually made things worse for me. I have been dealing with a lot of stressful things in my life over the past few years (and even more here recently), but this has definitely helped me tremendously. The only negative side effect I have experienced thus far with Fluoxetine is losing some sexual desire. This was/is a problem for me because my wife and I are currently trying to conceive. I have never had a problem in this department and actually I would say I had more desire when it comes to sex than most others. Just here recently I think I am starting to get back to normal a little bit in that department. I feel like my sexual desire may be coming back to me like it was before getting on this medication. Overall, I really like Fluoxetine and I think it's worth a shot if you are experiencing depression.

So before I decided to pursue my graduate degree, I knew that I would have to do something.  I talked to the doctor and she put me on a 10mg dose (which didn't do much, but allowed me to see if I could tolerate the medication and ease into taking an antidepressant).  After a couple weeks we stepped it up to the 20mg dose, and I wish that I had started this medication years ago!  The dose is low enough that I've recognized no side effects other than some trouble falling asleep during the first few weeks that I took the medication.  I sleep fine now, and all the problems with anxiety and depression are so much better.  I have to take it with food, though, or I get a bit of reflux.

192$Condition: Depression$11/28/2007 1:31:22 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$This is the second time I've been put on this medication for depression. The first time it really pulled me out of it, and I was quite bad off. This time, I can tell a definite difference in my mood, but still have days or moments of depression. It takes about 6 weeks to really kick in. I've been on it for five this time, so I'm hoping it will continue to improve. I've had no side effects from using this drug. Currently, I'm taking 20 mg once a day.

198$Condition: Depression$10/9/2007 12:32:28 PM$Reviewer: Jeshua Medrano, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$2$When i was first informed that i was suffering with depression i didnt take it very well yet i was willing to give the medecine a try. So far it has been about 12 weeks since ive been on the drug and i can say that unfortunatly i still dont see an improvement, i take it as directed by the doctor and i hate the side effects, dry mouth, it makes me a little dizy my palpitations are sometimes faster than ususal. Im still in the process of counseling so maybe the two together will help. 
199$Condition: Depression$10/2/2007 1:47:41 PM$Reviewer: $4$4$4$This has been really easy for me to use. I have a fairly low dosage (30mg) and it was recently upped to 40mg. The only thing I can possibly compain about is that I have to take it in the morning or it gives me sleepless nights.
