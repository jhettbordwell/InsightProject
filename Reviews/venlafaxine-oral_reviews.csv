At the age of 20 i went to seek help for my condition. Been taking diffrent types of SSRI for one yearand Due to many side effects i was put on venlafaxine 150 mg.
After a while my life became wonderful. 
I was flourishing and most of my bad feelings just went away. My self esteem went up. I felt normal, woke up every morning with good energies. First time for years i was happy.actually happy. Thats been the best days at my life. 
And then everything deteriorated as i decided to stop. First i was put on 75 mg, after that 37.5 mg. It was very hard quitting this drug. My dysthymia came back.
Been feeling bad for 1 year after i quit, so i decided to take this drug, that changed my life, again. 
But it didn't work. I guess im thankful for this drug for breaking my illness. This drug actually stopped my dysthymia for a while. After seeing it didnt work,Been trying diffrent types of snri,ssri, vitamins, b12 supplys but none of them worked. Im desperate.

1$Condition: Depression$4/2/2019 7:01:16 PM$Reviewer: Em, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$It was really life changing for me taking this. Iâ??ve been on so so so many other things when this finally worked it made such a difference 
2$Condition: Depression$11/14/2018 6:08:56 PM$Reviewer: me again, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more$5$5$5$"Life-changing, life-saving. I was prescribed 150 mg a day of the regular (not XR) form 18 years ago. I started feeling much better right away -- far less anxious and sad. The only downside is I can space out just enjoying my random happy thoughts so I need to remind myself to get back to getting things done -- but that's not too hard and way better than being sad and scared all the time. Once when I was sick (for other reasons) I couldn't keep the venlafaxine pills down which made me unintentionally go off it cold turkey, which gave me nightmares until I could get it to stay down again. That scared me so I weaned myself -- VERY SLOWLY! IMPORTANT! -- down to 75 mg a day, so now if I forget to take them I only get really sad and anxious ( no nightmares) until I get back on it. I also went off it on purpose -- VERY SLOWLY -- and stayed off for a year to see if maybe I didn't need it anymore. It was a horribly anxious year. I felt a million percent better when I went back on it. Because I take the regular form, I have never had the ""brain zaps"" or other weirdness associated with the XR form. A relative takes venlafaxine with results like mine; I think we have a genetic brain wiring issue that it mends. I am infinitely grateful this medicine exists and sad for all the people with this condition who were sad and scared every day before this was invented -- or who still are because they can't afford it. It is not for every depressed or anxious person -- I read that each medication only helps a small percent (but a different group usually) of all patients, but at least this helps some of us."
3$Condition: Depression$11/9/2018 1:05:14 PM$Reviewer: donthaveone, 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$This was prescribed for me when I was diagnosed with a fatal, incurable disease and expected to live no more than a few months. I have been taking it these few months and it has really helped. I actually feel happier and more upbeat than before my diagnosis! Which is kind of crazy, but I'm grateful to spend this time enjoying my remaining life. I hope it helps you as well. :)
4$Condition: Depression$9/6/2018 10:56:25 AM$Reviewer: Seb, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$3$I've been on this RX for about 2 years.  I do experience sweating more than I would like but I can live with it.  Overall it has helped stabilize my mood.  What I am experiencing more recently which is concerning and I'm trying to figure out if it's related to this RX is complete loss of bladder control.  I'm 38 and literally cannot hold my urge to urinate longer than a minute or two.  Has anyone had this same experience?  Over the last 6 months it went from moderate to severe.  I have a follow up to discuss but curious what others know.     
5$Condition: Depression$7/7/2018 2:17:39 PM$Reviewer: Texas girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$3$Venlafaxine helped my depression at first. But when I lost my job, it actually made my depression worse. I couldnâ??t do anything but sleep all day. I had brain fog and increased negative self-talk. I became suicidal a couple of times. Thankfully I reported this to my doctor and she is now in the process of weaning me off. OMG itâ??s like night and day. The fog has lifted, I can think clearly, I have a much more positive outlook, I have way more energy. My recommendation is that if this drug works for you, great. But the minute it stops working, tell your doctor immediately because it could make it worse to the point of suicide. 
6$Condition: Depression$7/1/2018 12:36:41 AM$Reviewer: Erin, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"Horrible experience for me. I took ONE PILL, the 37.5 mg dose as prescribed, for depression. Through the day I felt ok, maybe a little loopy, with some tension in the neck, slight headache, grinding of teeth. Went to sleep, then woke up in the middle of the night sweating profusely, extremely nauseas and hallucinating!! I had horrible, vivid thoughts, felt completely out of body and ""compelled"" to kill myself. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced. I was not suicidal before taking this drug. The little sane part left in me stashed all sharp objects into a drawer and flushed the meds. I crawled into bed, shaking all over, sweating buckets and terrified. I won't even speak to my doctor again after this experience. Lifestyle changes and eastern herbal supplements have been far more effective. It was my first experience with antidepressants and hopefully my last."
7$Condition: Depression$3/29/2018 10:44:17 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$I asked my doctor to prescribe me antidepressants and he prescribed me venlafaxine. I did experience insomnia, headaches, and small appetite in the beginning when taking this medicine. I started off with the minimum 37.5mg dose and increased it to 75mg after a month. The sudden increase led to suicidal thoughts and intense physical side effects. Though my doctor insisted that I take the drug for longer, I decided to get off the drug after 2 months after reading some reviews online. I just felt so tired and washed out all the time. The withdrawal was terrible. I couldn't go to school for a week. Constant migraines, nausea, dizziness, and no willpower. I was fortunate enough to only be taking the medicine for 2 months before I got off. I don't know how the withdrawals are for those who have been taking the drug for over a year. Now that I'm off, I feel like my mood has soared in the opposite direction and I'm a lot more awake/aware of my surroundings. REALLY don't recommend taking venlafaxine. It is not worth the side effects.
8$Condition: Depression$1/12/2018 11:28:58 AM$Reviewer: Jim, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I had to be hospitalized for 2 weeks in an mental health facility. The Psychiatrist switched my depression drug I had been taking from a Prozac derivative to Venlafaxine (Efexor} because she had had such positive results in patients than any other depression medication. Within a week I could tell a huge difference in relief from depression and anxiety. I truly feel great now and highly recommend this drug. It has renewed my joy in life!!!
9$Condition: Depression$12/4/2017 2:04:24 PM$Reviewer: gussa7, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$"I have been on venlafaxine for a few months and it has worked very well for me. I was on sertraline before and was having trouble getting out of bed, and the venlafaxine gives me more energy and motivation to do things and live life. 
Easy to take, I take a 150mg extended release capsule, so I only have to take it once a day. It has worked for me! I had some unusual sweating at night and teeth clenching for the first several weeks to a month, but those have mostly gone away now. "
10$Condition: Depression$10/6/2017 9:33:38 PM$Reviewer: Mytiggertiger, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$"Four years ago I injured my hamstring and pretty much every near-by body part on my left middle quadrant (hip, ALL my glute muscles, IT band, hamstring, etc) and fell into what my Doctor referred to as ""pain induced depression"".  He explained that if I were not in pain, I would not be depressed.

My injury caused permanent nerve and muscle damage, so I had to make drastic life-style changes that I was not use to.  (I went from overly active, to just getting by.)

I tried Cymbalta and after just one pill, it was a no-go for me (bad reactions.)  I was hesitant to try another brand, but thought I had nothing to loose.

My Doc put me on the lowest possible does of Venlafaxine (25mg 3xday) and after just 1 week, I started to notice a difference.  He wanted to increase me after 3 months, but I have never asked for it, as the minimal dose is just enough to get me wanting to live life again.  It also helped reduce my pain just enough that I have not had to go from my regular Tramadol to the dreaded Percocet.

I know this is not for everyone, but if you have nerve pain AND are depressed, this just may work for you.

NEVER GIVE UP, sometimes you have to be your own advocate.  (I saw 15 docs, had 9 MRIs, 7 various injections, 2CTs, 2 surgeries, 1 ultra sound, 1 PRP injection all in 4 years before I found something that works for me."
11$Condition: Depression$6/6/2017 6:58:17 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$"After getting this prescribed and not noticing any positive effects on my mood or energy levels, the psychiatrist suggested taking a higher dose and I have done so over the months up to 225mg. Even at that dosage I did not notice anything positive. 
The negative effects were less energy and a slight reduction in getting stuff done (which was already at a low level). Also lost my sex drive completely and I started eating a lot less and lost 10kg quite quickly. These were things that were all managable. 

The real problem started when I wanted to stop taking this, the withdrawal effects are horrible and make me feel physically sick. The brainzaps I am familiar with from withdrawing from citalopram and escitalopram and I can deal with fine. Bad nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, total exhaustion and flue like symptoms I am not familiar with and wish I knew about before even considering this drug. I have hot and cold flashes, I can't sleep for more than 2 hours at a time and wake up sweating, I am extremely irritated and restless. Taking the medication again gets rids of these symptoms quite quickly. Building down by halving the dosage all the way down to 37.5mg was not hard for me personally, but going down from that will require other drugs or me cutting open the pills and managing a lower dose through that. 

All in all this is not a drug that I could recommend without people being made aware very clearly that it has severe withdrawal effects. "
12$Condition: Depression$4/9/2017 11:00:27 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Night of the second day taking this, I'm drop-dead tired by 8pm. then was up and down all night with a 'knife in the skull' type of headache on the left side of my brain, and then hot and sweaty, and even mild hallucinations. morning of day three, and the headache is still off and on.
13$Condition: Depression$3/22/2017 10:44:08 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I got serotonin syndrome after taking one pill! I have also been on vyvanse for 4 years, so maybe there is an interaction there. I tried this after 3 different SSRIs didn't work. I woke up incredibly anxious, sweating, had chills and then hot flashes, and then threw up and couldn't eat or drink for hours. I got so dehydrated I had 2 IVs of saline put it me. So yeah, it is possible to get serotonin syndrome after taking one pill. I stopped throwing up after the effexor wore off and I got some zofran at the hospital. 
14$Condition: Depression$10/31/2016 8:40:11 PM$Reviewer: hagrlvr, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year$4$4$4$I was on this drug for about 10 months.  I started taking it because I had no energy to get up off the couch and do anything.  Within a couple of weeks I started feeling much better, got up off the couch and started walking.  After a couple of months I had lost over 20 pounds.  I decided to stop taking it because of a pre-existing bruising problem that had gotten somewhat worse.  I was afraid to stop taking it because of all the negative reviews that I had read about withdraw symptoms.  I took about 3 months to wean myself off and had no problems at all.  This med might not be right for everyone, but it worked for me. 
15$Condition: Depression$8/26/2016 8:57:14 PM$Reviewer: musicrocks, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$After my father passed away I became severely depressed. My Dr. prescribed three different SSRI's but they were not effective. Prescribed this and it has been a lifesaver. You MUST take it regularly for more than a month to six months so everyone who reviewed this after only using it briefly does not realize the full benefit of the medication.

18$Condition: Depression$5/14/2016 7:12:12 PM$Reviewer: whereami?, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$3$4$Used Effexor 10 years ago, then no insurance, switched to Prozac. Now on Medicare (disabled), back to Venlafaxine for 7 years. My current dose is 450 mg per day.  That's right. One 150mg pill in the morning, two at night. Upped to 450 after depression got bad again. Now I rarely sleep, but would give up my right arm if I could. Still depressed, but lack the energy to kill myself. If I screw up taking it on time, then you can mark 1 or 2 days off the calendar, bc I'm so tired I'm incoherent. Not sleeping tho. Just sitting around like a bowl of jello. Sounds terrible, but it is the lesser evil. See PCP next month and am going to make some changes. IF I remember, that is. Other daily meds-(3)15mg morphine for back/hip pain, levothyroxine for thyroid, pravastatin for cholesterol and nabumetone. 
19$Condition: Depression$4/25/2016 3:55:56 PM$Reviewer: Sorely Dissatisfied, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$1$2$I think this medication should be outlawed.  The side effects of withdrawals are really scary...dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, memory loss, confusion, anxiety...I believe this is designed for one to be on for the remainder of their life.

27$Condition: Depression$7/22/2015 3:45:45 PM$Reviewer: PHUMM, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been on this drug for approximately 18 months.   I started taking because of seasonal depression and am the heaviest I have ever been in my life.   I have picked up 35 lbs while taking this drug.   When I initially starting taking this, I took it in the morning and it made me VERY tired.   I switched to taking it right before bed and that worked out well for me.  I have experience a serious increase in sweating and hot flashes.   When I miss a dose, get out of my way.   Serious dizziness and I have a hairpin trigger for getting pissed off.  I have been trying for three weeks to get off of this drug (by a gradual reduction in dosage) during the summer and the only thing I can say is the physical withdrawal I am experiencing is beyond severe.  Short temper, episodes of increased anger, dizziness and nausea, sleeplessness,   I am contemplating staying on the drug to avoid the withdrawal symptoms.    You have to decide which is worse, the depression or the side effects of the drug, if they apply to you. 
28$Condition: Depression$7/13/2015 7:43:53 PM$Reviewer: Baywitch, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $2$1$4$The doctor put me on venlafaxine to replace my cymbalta (which I loved but very expensive even with insurance).  It did not work as well as Cymbalta.  He increased mg. it made everything worse as I was as taking nortripline and clonazepam. It was also getting to expensive to go to him. So I started removing myself off venfaxine. Reducing dosage very slowly.  I did nave some withdrawals but nothing with depression.  I have been off for a month now. I am a lot happier, and not as tired and sleeping all the time.  I know the nortripline is still there but the cost of it is not as bad as the other.  I think the cost was also adding to my problem and anxiety.  I am going to keep in touch with my GP as he knows what I been taking.  I hope I did not make a mistake taking myself off it but I don't feel like I did.

HOWEVER, the withdrawal effects are HORRIBLE.  Whenever I have accidentally forgotten to take a dose, one of the first things I experience is what could best be described as an ""electric pulse"" going up the back of my neck to the base of my skull.  I then begin to feel physically ill, and eventually will vomit.  Weakness, fatigue and a lack of sex drive are all side effects I have dealt with while taking this medication.

By the end of the day my chin and bottom lip were huge and I had massive hives all over my body! Not knowing I went to a allergist who didn't think it was a drug allergy so we did blood work and put me on prednisone for 5 day. Well at day 5 the hives were gone but I had started taking my mess again so of course the hives came right back. I since saw my counselor and he switched my meds to wellbutrine 200 mg.

It takes about 24 to 36 hours to start feeling something like jolts or shocks through my body. I was on 75mg now down to the 37mg now i'm going off of it. I'm sure many people could benefit from this drug unfortunately I am not one of you. I truly hate thinking/believing a pill can solve my problems without me having to get my hands dirty so to speak. Thats what counseling is for. I have never hoped for a miracle pill I just want something that can kick me out of that funk. So i'm not upset that this drug didn't change my life. This drug didn't give me a dulled or baseline feeling (no high highs or deep lows) which was what kept me on it for so long. Sometimes it hard to tell whats working and you don't want to stop taking it and find out it was doing the lion's share of the work. I would also caution everyone to take any review of (5 star or 1 star) from people within a week of treatment the placebo/expectation effect can be very misleading. I am only sharing this because I have been on it for a long period to explain its effects on me. extra info I'm 30 on lisinopril/hctz for high blood pressure. Ritalin 20mg. Bupropion 200mg. Hope someone finds this helpful. And I hope everyone finds something that helps you make it through the day.

The first time about 12 years ago for 2+ years and currently on it for 2 years. The side effects/withdrawal symptoms are the worst things I've ever experienced. I can miss a dose by about 24hrs and have migraine headaches, dizziness, nausea, and irritability, and sometimes I feel like my brain is shaking.  As long as I take the medication as directed and on time the only bothersome side effects I have are increased sweating/hot flashes and random muscle twitch mostly occurring at bed time. Overall, I love how this medication works for my depression and anxiety issues. That completely out weighs the side effects of a missed dose. Just have to be extra cautious to fill RX on time and not forget a dose

While it helped with my depression, it has had long lasting side effects. Whenever I miss a dosage I go through crippling withdrawals. One time i ran out of a refill and went 2 days without it. I slept for 20 hours straight and wasn't able to wake up. Now I'm 22 and I've been  trying to get off this drug for over a year. Its taking so long because my body goes through withdrawals every time the decrease the dosage. This worked for my depression. This drug is psychoactive and alters your brain chemistry. This drug alleviates your depression but only masks the actual issue.

This worked very well for suppressing most of my conditions, but not 100% like I would like it to.
I started out on 50 mg, move up over 6 months to 150 mg I am currently at now and have noticed the side effects are drastically effecting my everyday life.

It has reduced the overall amount of panic attacks, and my depression to a manageable point. But has worsening my anxiety levels, I get daily hot flashes/sweats, impulsive actions, severe restlessness, and very rapid speech to name a few.

I have sever Sleep Apnea and since starting this, my overall amount of sleep has decreased from 6.75 hrs. a night to 4 hrs. or less a night. Even with taking Ambient CR 12.5 mg it doesn't help.

As with any medication, it effects everyone differently, I'm only posting this info so it might help someone else.

I'm currently researching if I should lower my current 150 mg dose and add BuSpar. Hopefully I can figure out a balance.

I can't sit and do any work (search the web, read, play a board game with the kids)or I'll fall asleep.  I'm back to normal by Sunday.  The depression is under control so I tolerate the sleepiness.

I was diagnosed in 1995 and have tried many different meds.  To me they all have side effects. Is it worth tolerating for the overall benefit?  I have experienced most of the stated side effects, but will tolerate them until I can afford the effexor xr again.  My depression is much worst than even the brain zap side effects.  My main frustration is the insurance company's manipulation of our health care.  They should want to help us get better--not pricing us into cheap ineffective care!  I recommend effexor, it really helps me.

I was unproductive and severely depressed for several days and it took several weeks to become stable.  I was scared and very ill.  If you are needing help with your depression please know that the withdrawl procedure is very important and very difficult.  I also had decreased sex drive, weight gain and it really didn't do the trick for me overall.  Wellbutrin is far easier and more effective for me.

After using the brand name Effexor XR capsules for 5 years without any problems and with good results in terms of alleviating depression, my pharmacy decided to switch me to this oblong orange capsule generic (even though it was the same price as brand name).  After using this generic for 3 weeks, I noticed that it was not working well in controlling depression and I heard/felt that ""whooshing/brain zap"" in my brain that others have described. Worst of all, I experienced a horrible serontin syndrome the 4th week, so I immediately called my dr. and he switched me back to the brand name, red Effexor XR capsules. My neurologist and my friend who works at a pharmaceutical company told me to beware of generics, because they are NOT the same as the brand name; their manufacturers are not held to the same stringent regulations in order to produce their drugs, the manufacturers are not required to use the full percentage of active ingredients, formulations and potency can vary, etc. You truly get what you pay for!"

When taking this med you should take it at the same time every day, and never let the med run out because the withdrawal side effects are not nice. Vertigo, dizziness, and what I like to call brain zaps a very unpleasant feeling in your head. It is very difficult for me to be weaned off so now I take a very low dose every day. When I say weaned off, your doc. has to subscribe a lower dose, that you take less and less of for 1 to 2 weeks. You cannot quit cold turkey because it will mess you up.
115$Condition: Depression$2/1/2011 10:27:20 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$2$5$"It has taken me a very long time to realize that my night sweats, hyperhidrosis, agitation, constant yawning and other problems are all due to the Effexor XR/Venlafaxine. I have complained to my doctors about these things and all I get is a blood work up and then nothing. My tests always come out fine, but not one single doctor has made the connection between this drug and those severe side effects. My psychiatrist didn't even know what ""brain zaps"" were. I am becoming very discrouraged with the medical community and the lack of proper help. I recently switched to the generic because of my insurance change and the side effects are the same. I get these side effects constantly, but especially if I am a little late on my dosage. I cannot stand that fact that I am a prisoner to this drug and I may never get off of it. It made a difference 13 years ago when I was a teenager, with my depression and anxiety, but had I known then all that I know now, I would never have gotten on this drug. I have read that people like me who eventually wean down to 25mg or so have the ""discontinuation syndrome"" for years, that's if it ever goes away. And please be aware- their new drug ""Pristiq"" is the same thing!! It is call DEvenlafaxine, and has the same side effects....I want to get this out there so other don't go through this hell!!!"

On the first day of the medicine, not only was I dizzy, but I forgot how to read for 5 seconds. Not that good of a thing to happen on the highway.  Earlier that day, I tried to set my digital alarm clock to wake me up, and granted I couldn't fall asleep, when I looked over at my desired 'wake up' time, i noticed why the thing didn't go off--I was still in the settings! There was many incidences that lead to 'moments' tied to this medicine, because I had even asked my brother what batteries a printer took to receive remote access functions. Sadly this is one medicine that won;t so much fix your (problem) as it would make you forget everything else and turn it into unbearable frustration. Here, normally, people come to me for help, and this medicine made me forget the names of the people I live with---even my own husband! I think you should consult your doctor on a trial before taking this medicine, because i'm certainly going to... if I remember to call him tomorrow, since I forgot to today.

My refil this replaced my effexor.  After a week or 10 days I noticed irritability, depression, which has worsened with use. I spoke with my pharmacist re this reaction and she has heard of no other reactions like mine with the use of this generic. She said some people just don;t feel that a generic works as well.  I am not one of those people, believe me.  I would much rather pay a $3.00 co-pay than a $30.00 one. She said that my BCBS may not be willing to pay for me to get Effexor now that a proven generic is out. I have to call my Dr. tomorrow as I do not feel that I can continue to take this med. It took several months to get me regulated with an anti depressant.  The first 2 I tried either didn't help or stopped working after 6 months of so.

I continue to feel very depressed on the inside, but outwardly I think I pull of a pretty good cover.   It's as if there are no other options.   I suffer from epilepsy (controlled with meds for 18 yrs.) and migraine headaches.   I do believe that there is a huge difference in some of the name brand drugs and generic drugs with regard to effectiveness, but pharmacists, my doctors and insurance company continually state that all these drugs have the same active ingredients and one is just as effective as the other, but at lower costs; I disagree.  I think it has more to do with money than my actual well being.   I've complained for years of low libido and increased weight (about 75 lbs. over the last 10 years) and no one seems interested in assisting me with these problems.   Yet, if I complained of chest pain, you can bet, I'd get all kinds of tests to get to the bottom of that problem.

My depression is there but it no longer takes over my life. I have had to learn good coping techniques. If I stay up past midnight, some hyper something happens and I am up all night. I can tell when I have missed a dose but take a pill right away when that happens and the symtoms go away. The worst side effect has been a slowly worsening loss of memory and that started day one.

I broke out in hives head to toe and I never had an allergy prior. I had to stop taking it immediately and the withdrawal symptoms were horrific. For the last 10 months I have been on several drug combinations in an attempt to get rid of the hives. I've been on a immune-suppressant drug called cyclosporine for the last six. This is also a dangerous medication, but the only thing that would control the hives. Unfortunately, many people suffer from chronic hives/edema after taking this medication. See here for more stories: http://depression.about.com/b/2009/07/31/forum-ef fexor-xr-and-hives.htm#gB3 I strongly recommend not EVER taking this medication as the lasting effects have destroyed any normalcy in my life for the last 10 months. Although it is not listed as a common side-effect, my allergist said that 3-4% of people do have some sort of reaction and that he sees several each year with hives. Also, it can take 1-3 years for your immune system to recover so the hives go away. I will regret the day I began taking this medication for the rest of my life.

I am very terrified about the withdrawl effects of me just abruptly stopping this medication, because I didn't sleep a wink last night, I was covered in sweat and had to change clothes twice during the night, along with having crazy nightmares, but that is what my Dr. said to do, so I have no clue what else I can do, I need the itching and red bumps and swelling and misery to go away!

On the downside, I am unable to sleep as I did with the Cymbalta, and when I do sleep, I have these horrible nightmares that I never had before. It is like the medication is bringing all my fears and anxieties to life in my head each night. They are very scary, and I often awake with my heart pounding and feeling very anxious but that goes away when I see that I am safe. Has anyone else experienced this?

Whether it was psychosomatic or not, I felt relief immediately on taking the first 25 mg tab.

Then, also with rapid onset, it began to give me hot flashes (which I left behind several years ago). I realize that Venlafaxine is sometimes prescribed to relieve hot flashes, but it had the opposite effect on me.

Scrip said to increase dose by 25 mg every 5 days to max of 50 mg in AM and 50 mg in PM.

I decided to stick with the extremely low 25 mg dose once/day for just over two weeks, and then increase by a half tab.

I felt myself slip back into depression, and of course, the hot flashes remained.

I called the doctor to report on this, and he prescribed Trazodone instead.

I was on Venlafaxine for about one month.

We'll see how Trazodone works..."

At this point I would say the benefits outweigh those mild side effects.  One other weird thing: Huge loss of appetite.

I was reluctant to use Effexor due to some of the negative reviews I read but since I had success last year using Cymbalta

Every time I try to cut back I go into the ""discontinuation syndrome"".  I hate to think I'm going to be stuck on this all my life!  Occasionally I do forget to take my meds, especially if I'm away from home.  When I forget to take the morning meds, I'm in the discontinuation syndrome state by that evening.

Miserable.  

I have contacted the FDA and the manufacturer.  I still haven't heard anything back.

Also, my Medicare Part D provider has decided to raise the GENERIC venlafaxine to tier 2, which means I will pay full price from now until the end of the year.  Yet I can't get off the med.  What to do?

Began on 37.5 and gradually increased to 150 mg of extended release daily.  It has been a major factor in improving my quality of life; experienced some sleepiness initially but that has diminished.  I could tell a difference within a week of having started even the lowest dose.  Missed two doses due to a stomach virus at one point and the effects of withdrawal were immediate and severe.  I'm very careful to take it at exactly the same time every day, and with food.  It has helped me regain focus and experience less stress at work and at home.  I asked about changing to the generic due to the cost but my doctor did not recommend it as the XR version is not available as a generic, and his confidence in the quality of the generic was not very high.

I felt panicked at school like I was going to do/say something wrong & get in trouble.  At 38,although I had made it to a supervising position, I still doubted everything I did. I overworked because I never thought I was doing good enough until I finally became so exhausted and lost contact with reality. Hospitalized for 3 weeks I was tried on several things with different side effects.
Now I have been on Effexor for 13 yrs (as Venlafaxine for the last year).
1 yr my dr chgd me to XR but realized it cost lots more then regular release so I switched back.
Generic seems no different to me.
I get nauseous only if I don't eat within 15 min of taking a dose.
Memory & concentration are better since I don't worry all the time except when I am having my period, then both are flighty.
I have noticed repeatedly that if I take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol, it seems to block my anti-depressant. Several days of Ibuprofen would cause the return of depression, sadness & anxiety. I stick with Tylenol & I am fine.
The first years I took 3x37.5mg a day, about 4 yrs ago I moved down to 2x37.5mg and then only 1x37.5mg a day.  Mainly because of $. For me, I found 1x3.75 good for 3 wks a mth but needed 2x37.5 during my period week. Or if something extra stressfull happened like a death, a car accident, or moving.
Taking this drug gave me relief from my depression so I could work through my problems. The drug can't fix me all by itself but I couldn't move on into improving myself without its help.
I am very gratefull for the greater enjoyment I can feel in life now.

Tried to reduce dosage by lowest possible level (even by cutting 37.5gm tablets in half) numerous times but my brain reacts severely - within hours if alternate day reduction used or within a few days if reduction over longer than alternate days. Withdrawal is so bad that my entire body becomes unable to function at all and all I can do is sleep or move around slowly. Symptoms of depression seem to return but I am convinced this is due to drug dependency. Doctors advise to remain dependent on the drug. My feelings are: 1.The drug has been progressively reducing the ability of my brain to function. 2. Since taking the drug, while I am generally happy and generally functioning well, the level of my brain activity and ability has reduced dramatically. I am not always able to think clearly. 3. My memory has become totally unreliable, to the point that I can be convinced a conversation never took place or that I did not receive information that had infact been given to me. I have tried to change to a different antidepressant but this has caused the same effects as a dosage reduction.

207$Condition: Depression$9/28/2007 2:27:26 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$4$I used this drug for 1 year in fighting depression.It did help with that, but the depression was stemming from the effects of undiagnosed multiple sclerosis. It is now 2 years later and I have developed a cataract of my right eye. Though small and only one eye, it is still troubling. It was just masking the real problem.I would NOT recommend this drug.

209$Condition: Depression$9/20/2007 2:45:22 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have had major depression and anciexty for seven years.  My doctor changed me from Citalapram to Venlafaxine slow release within the last three months.  It has done wonders for my mood and energy levels.  I did miss about three doses one week and I felt the symtoms described for withdrawal but I am back on it regularly and I am very impressed how it has made my life much better overall.
