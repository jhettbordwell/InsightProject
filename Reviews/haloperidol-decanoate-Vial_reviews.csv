It caused my tics to get worse, made my life even harder because I was being made fun of at school and did nothing to alleviate my symptoms. This stuff did nothing to ease the tics, and made it harder to sleep, hard to concentrate, and generally difficult to focus and study. I flunked 2 classes when I was on this stuff, something that had NEVER happened before. I will absolutely refuse to ever take this medication again, and I will NEVER recommend it to anybody!"
