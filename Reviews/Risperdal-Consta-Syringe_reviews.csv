0$Condition: Manic-Depression$5/20/2019 1:51:33 PM$Reviewer: Jacob, 25-34 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I am 28, with a long history of bipolar 1 and schizoeffective disorder. After trying many antipsychotics, and failing treatment with form of tablets, I now use injectables, Risperdal consta. Though my health care provider and county are very angry it came to this course of treatment- I live in a very small town. I have been to jail, and my insurance no longer places me in decent facilities because of this route of treatment. You are viewed negatively. Please consider this and talk about this with your insurance and psychiatrist in question for your loved on. God speed.

I used to have a six pack and was jacked now I've gained twenty pounds. I'd prefer to have my slightly deranged thoughts then be on this med but I'm forced to be on it. Society is screwed up your torturing us.
2$Condition: Schizophrenia$2/28/2016 12:33:32 AM$Reviewer: mic888, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$3$the change over from Haldol 17 years to riaperdal was harsh, oral...after 5 years went to intramuscle...the results are much better, the problem with timing the oral meds is gone and regular sensations of normal life are much more abundant....but there is a very dark place that wasn't there with the Haldol, thus the worry about panic...this is eased by regularity in eating sleeping and exercising...the key is the combination of balance between real life and the self. the self being satisfied and the mind being ok with it.

5$Condition: Other$5/3/2015 4:45:49 PM$Reviewer: Previously charismatic, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $1$1$5$Writing on behalf of my 19 year old son, who has a Schizoaffective diagnosis & previous bipolar & BPD diagnoses. During a forced admission to ICU when he visited a psychiatrist to talk about his MS (we were managing okay), he was started on this drug (37.5mg) & discharged into the community after 3 shots. All passion for living has gone completely. His depression is now so much worse than it has ever been, gained 13kg in a month, aching muscles despite lack of use. It is now almost 3 months since his final injection (we sent him out of the country to avoid the compulsory treatment order) & he is spending 20 hours a day in bed, can't manage to self care or exercise whereas he was previously a charismatic energetic skateboarder who mentored younger kids and exercised 5 hours a day. Bloods show tripled prolactin levels, elevated lipids & cholesterol damage. Although we are still hoping for some improvement, we can say without doubt that this drug has destroyed my sons life for more than 6 months, & that was only 3 injections. Be warned!

This medicine is very helpful for me, very beneficial, as it keeps my mood and behavior very good at all times.  I started on Risperdal Oral but was switched to Consta a short time later. I prefer the Risperdal Consta over the oral type of this medication.  I highly recommend this medication!!!

Before he was on Risperdal shot,he took the pills, but he stopped in 2009, because he thought he could use another form of treatment. He was okay until Dec. of 2009. Then he went crazy with fear. He thought our city was being poisoned by the water. While at our house he was asking if we had any guns.  He was so depressed, we were fearful of what he might do. He went back to his house to get some clothes. While there, he took all of his pills trying to commit suicide. When I went to check on him. I found him with pills scattered all over the floor and said he took most of them. I called 911. He spent 3 weeks in a hospital in Spokane, WA. They realized the shot was the best course to treatment. He has been on the shot since then and doing quite well.

17$Condition: Bipolar Disorder in Remission$4/28/2012 2:11:22 AM$Reviewer: Why Not? BP aTX, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$2$I took Risperdal when I entered treatment for Bipolar 1 (Major Depressive) along with alcohol and meth addiction (snorter).  I was in psychosis from the substance abuse and untreated bipolar. I needed the antipyschotic. It worked well to help me get back to reality. I experienced pretty bad side effects: rapid weight gain, major ticks and uncontrolled body movements, saliva gathering at creases in mouth, body core overheating without notice, extreme lethargy. But! I came back to reality during my seven months on the drug. And sixty five pounds later I was happier fat and sane than skinny and insane. It stabilized my mood, eased the delusions, started the brain chemistry back on track and allowed me to think again.  I had brain fog.  I moved onto Invega a second generation of Risperdal from what I was told with far less side effects.  I'm glad I was not on it very long.  As far as antipsychotics go, one must be aware of the potency and how strong they can be as far as side effects. Please take precautions ie avoid heating up as I did not realize how I could suddenly heat my core and hit the ground.  But  you can take other drugs for the ticks and it really worked on the psychosis for me. I toughened up on this drug. It made many I went onto the past six years seem tame... Relativity... and sanity. It did work. It hurt and I got fat but I got better.

Is there any way I can stop the psychiatrist from giving me the injections.  I am completely normal for the last so many years and I don't know how the medication can be stopped once it is started.  The psychiatrist has said that I must take it all my life.  It is very expensive to take this medication all your life and is a drain on my resources.  Among the side effects are weakening of the muscles of the eye (I am not able to open my eyelids when i get up in the morning).  doctor refuses to stop the injections.  Even my calf muscles seem to have weakened and I fear that my heart muscles and other muscles in my body may have weakened also due to this strong injection that I have been taking for so many years now.  I have also put on weight due to the medication but psychiatrist is not attributing it to the injection and continues to treat me wiht it because he thinks the more expensive the drug, the better it is.  I would like to know what will make the psychiatrist stop the medication all together.

I was non-compliant on oral meds, and in the hospital more than I was out because of my symptoms.  It took a while for my moods to regulate, but eventually,it worked better than anything else. I have not had an episode in three years, nor, of course, been hospitalized.  It helps me because it takes away my ability to be non-compliant, because I do it in a doctors office, and because it is only every two weeks.  Overall, it is one of the things that helped me return to a normal life.
