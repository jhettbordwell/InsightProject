I was having dizzy spells and unbalanced walking, felt like passing out at times. He prescribed this for those symptoms.  After taking this, I had major headaches, blurred vision, panic attacks not to mention it did nothing for my original symptoms.  I think this doctor is a quack! "

I take 3-250mg pills 8 hrs apart. January is usually my worst month for migraines because of the weather swings and I only needed 1 zomig at the beginning of the month. I started divalproex in Nov. Tried topamax but had terrible allergic reactions. This one is way cheaper and works well for me. Just keep trying until you find what works for you.

This medicine did make it stop, HOWEVER, my hair has come out severely.I bet I have lost half the hair on my head!! I am just now figuring out the reason for my hair loss has got to be this drug since it is a side effect. I am fearful to stop the drug since it does stop the headache.Hoping my doctor can find another drug to work as well and that my hair will grow back.
11$Condition: Migraine Prevention$4/12/2012 12:54:57 AM$Reviewer: ArtGirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$3$When I started on this over 2 years ago, it helped more than the others I had tried, even though I was still getting 20+ headaches/month.  The hair loss is finally getting to such a point that we are going to try to decrease & possibly discontinue it since the Botox treatments are going so well.  Botox has cut my migraines in half. :)

Plus I am now having problems with my jaw it hurts and on the left right under the tongue is a large sore that looks like a bone but the whole jaw line hurts. The headaches are less but it has not helped the pain from the ladder hitting me on the head four months ago and has not helped my fibermyalga.

But now I have weight gain and joint pain very difficult to get out of bed in the mornings or if i have been sitting for a while my body is so stiff . Fear what the long term effects will be on me in the long run ! My Dr. has told me to stop taking the meds cold turkey and now the headaches are back still w/ joint pain . Signed, Sadden :)

It does not worry me but it worries him, he is also a Dimentia pt w/schitzophrenia and believes the Doctors are lying to him because he can't find an image on WebMD It is a Gray Oblong ER Coated pill. I understand that there are Generic Versions but why can I not find my sons specific medicitation here?

18$Condition: Migraine Prevention$5/24/2010 12:01:51 PM$Reviewer: Raj, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I am a long time cluster headache sufferer - episodal not chronic. The last time I had it I was on the drug for about 10 weeks. I had other drugs too as preventive medicines. The combination helped me to get out of the headaches. Even otherwise I would have been out of it. That is the typical time period for my cluster. One side effect ( may be ) is dry skin like psoraisis - it was bad. Now it is getting better. Another effect was trembling of my hands when I tried to pick something like a glass of water. It has gotten better since I am off the drug. Drowsiness was there but it made it difficult to go to sleep.

After trying multiple meds that caused me to gain weight, back-and-forth prevention of migraines, and changes in my blood pressure that is already low, I landed on this one.  I am to take one to two 500mg at bedtime since it may cause drowsiness.  That is a happy change since so many of the other meds caused insomnia.  I still have a lot of weight from trying to find the right med, but am glad that this is working for its primary goal--headache free.  I am thrilled that it works, but am looking to get off meds so that my body can readjust.  Not sure how much this med affects periods, but I have missed two in a year now and I used to be VERY regular!  I will be going in for a check-up again to make sure that it isn't affecting anything else.

I had only taken it only 1 week. I wasn't warned by my doctor to look for side effects. It's been 1-19-10, since I've been off it and the effects are still there. Who knows what would have become of me if I had taken any longer? I was being treated for migrains.
22$Condition: Migraine Prevention$2/10/2010 9:43:42 PM$Reviewer: DD, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I have daily migraines + severe auras (alice in wonderland syndrome). Divalproex takes care of much of the syndrome, and I can't miss a single dosage of it without getting a migraine. However, while it may not have worsened my depression, it certainly hasn't helped, so watch yourself.

Have been on Divalproex for 5 weeks.  Have had lots of headaches and migraines in that short time, and my hair is falling out like crazy :(  Doc decided it's time to try a third med.  Prescribed Amitriptyline, but I'm concerned I'll have some of the same side effects (crazy heart rate/trouble breathing/blurred vision) that made me end Topamax after reading reviews.  Help!

It has work well for migraines. It gives me moderate control of muscle stabing and aching pains in legs and arms. On bad days the spasms in body feel like little electric shocks.
I take up to 5 500 pills a day which makes swallowing them difficult on a day with nausea. "
28$Condition: Migraine Prevention$3/15/2009 11:33:04 PM$Reviewer: umcanes, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"Been on this for over 2 years (minus 1 month) the Depakote ER version (The brand name one). 

I had really bad migraines with aura (including tingling in left arm, left leg tightness, periods of lethargy/inability, mood swings, bright colors, sensitivity to light, ""sinus"" pain, followed by a moderate headache...total disruption of my life, I had even just moved and started a new job (luckily not much was expected of me at work when I started).

Tried Topamax for a month, did not relieve aura symptoms and cause terrible insomnia and was giving me terrible side effects.

Switched away from stubborn doc, went to specialist, had MRI, EEG, and other test to make sure of the diagnosis, and was prescribed this (500mg/day), worked within a few days. I was back to my normal self.

No aura symptoms, and greatly controlled headache pain (only occasional ""sinus pain"" caused by migraine remained). I was prescribed amitryptiline 25 mg/day for this pain and IBS burning, I only take it occasionally not regularly. 

The low dose of amitryptiline seemed to augment the positive effects of the Depakote (at first would have some very minor prickling or stinging paid from the combo, but it went away in a month and wasn't a problem).

I get a rash 8 hours after I put on sunscreen, but I think this happened once before when I wasn't even taking Depakote (I wasn't taking anything as a recall). 

No noticeable side effects from Depakote at first. 

I gained 20 lbs over a year, but it might've been from my thyroid being underactive (this was found later on, and is not necessarily related to the depakote according to my doctor). Also might've been because my appetite returned because I was feeling healthy again.

The insomnia I experienced from Topamax disappeared after switching to this. However, I have not tried the new generic, and my insurance is forcing to do the generic the next time I refill."
