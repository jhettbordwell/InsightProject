The worst side effect was the rapid weight gain. I was used to some weight gain from other meds I had used, but on divalproex I gained 40 lbs. in 2 months, then herniated a disc while exercising to take off the weight. Spent two years with back doctors, meanwhile my weight ballooned. I went from 200 (already overweight) to 275. At 275 I developed hight blood pressure, heart disease, rashes, lung problems, and my back pain was excruciating and constant. I stopped taking Divalproex, started a number of heart meds, and my cardiologist supervised a diet, and now I am down to 170. I will always have a bad back now, but it is better than it was. I still have the heart issues, but blood pressure is under control with medication. I am struggling to control my Bi-Polar II without medication, but this was definitely a case of the cure being worse than the disease. I wish I had never been on Divalproex. It nearly killed me, didn't help all that much anyway, and I will suffer the residual health problems the rest of my life.

8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/25/2016 8:27:16 PM$Reviewer: Anish1979 , 35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$4$I was misdiagnosed for over 15 years with docs always saying it was just depression. I have bipolar with depression, anxiety, ADHD, agoraphobia, and on top of all that Fibromyalgia. When I was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder my doc tried many different meds, but I had severe reactions to all of them. The first med that worked was Lithium. I got my labs done and never had too much in my blood, but ended up losing over half my hair and gaining over 100 pounds! I weaned myself off of the Lithium and doc put me on Depakote/Divalprox ER. I lost 140 pounds in 6 months and got all my hair back. I take Cymbals, Valium, Ritalin, and Gabapentin as well. I felt like a new person, mild depression, mood swings much better, and rage/psycho feeling episodes were better. I have had to teach myself to avoid confrontations and other situations though. Grogginess in morning has always been there, could be meds for Fibromyalgia. Overall this mixture of meds has been a lifesaver! I am so glad to not feel like a lab rat anymore!

31$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/8/2014 12:16:19 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Divalproex is the third bipolar med I've tried, and it's the first that doesn't feel like a complete waste of money. I do get some slight tremors after my morning dose, but that's the only side effect I've experienced (my liver function's actually improved since I switched from lithium). There's a definite difference in my mood, too -- I'm far less irritable and edgy on divalproex than I felt on lithium or Lamictal, and it works fast enough to help prevent my bad moods from escalating.

43$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/2/2013 11:25:45 AM$Reviewer: Tibby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$1$3$I have not had good experiences from the beginning. I'm not one to complain, so at first I just ignored the side effects because I wanted my moods to be stable, after multiple drug trials and being hospitalized from the bad reactions to other drug trials. I first started with 250mgs in the mornings, it caused me to become very shaky, nauseous and loss of appetite. The headaches were nothing; anyone should expect headaches when you’re trying to stable neurons in the brain. My Psychiatrist told me to start taking it at night time, that went well, so he increased the dose to 500mgs. Then I started experiencing some grogginess in the morning. I was extremely upset because I'm a morning person, I literally LIVE for mornings. Anyways, because I'm also ADD, the doctor prescribed me Vyvance for the morning and my mornings are back! (Vyvance is a whole other story - but I only take it when I absolutely need it because I find my body gets immune to it if I take it every day - I skip weekends - I'm a college student) So now after 6 months of taking it, my I find it help me tolerate a lot more and balance my moods. The only problem is now I’m starting to have side effects, such as abdominal pain, back pain, tiredness, nausea and vomiting. I know it’s because of my medication because I missed a dose the other night and my symptoms weren’t as bad the next day. I’m actually at work in the middle of nowhere, so I’m jumping on the plane tomorrow to see the Doctor. I found this medication worked, but too bad for the side effect.

After years of ""mood swings"" I sought help. Was in therapy for a year and then found a psychiatrist that prescribed 500mg of depakote er.  My mood is stabilized and I find my life being fuller and more productive. I do miss the creative bursts of the manic phase, but sure don't miss the random sex, excessive illicit druge use e.g. cocaine, and drinking myself to sleep. I hope this helps any of you going through what I've gone through. Been on it for almost a year and no side effects."

The last time I had it I was on the drug for about 10 weeks. I had other drugs too as preventive medicines. The combination helped me to get out of the headaches. Even otherwise I would have been out of it. That is the typical time period for my cluster. One side effect ( may be ) is dry skin like psoraisis - it was bad. Now it is getting better. Another effect was trembling of my hands when I tried to pick something like a glass of water. It has gotten better since I am off the drug. Drowsiness was there but it made it difficult to go to sleep.

After trying multiple meds that caused me to gain weight, back-and-forth prevention of migraines, and changes in my blood pressure that is already low, I landed on this one.  I am to take one to two 500mg at bedtime since it may cause drowsiness.  That is a happy change since so many of the other meds caused insomnia.  I still have a lot of weight from trying to find the right med, but am glad that this is working for its primary goal--headache free.  I am thrilled that it works, but am looking to get off meds so that my body can readjust.  Not sure how much this med affects periods, but I have missed two in a year now and I used to be VERY regular!  I will be going in for a check-up again to make sure that it isn't affecting anything else.

My main problem is that I am a vet and suffer from PTSD and I can't get my mind to shut off. This med has slowed down my thought patterns. I can still function, but I don't have massive confusion. I do suffer from short term memory delay which in my case is worth the trade of having ""peace"" in my head. I also suffer from fibromyalgia. I have not seen much improvement in that area. Over all I am pleased. I do suffer some vision problems but as time goes on they seem to be less. I take it at night so I do sleep. Again, the biggest thing this drug has done for me is slow my racing thoughts down. I feel less impulsive, less edgy and less nervous.  I have also been able to decrease my anxiety medication significantly.  I do have slight tremors.  BUT...For all that is negative, there is much more that is positive."

I had really bad migraines with aura (including tingling in left arm, left leg tightness, periods of lethargy/inability, mood swings, bright colors, sensitivity to light, ""sinus"" pain, followed by a moderate headache...total disruption of my life, I had even just moved and started a new job (luckily not much was expected of me at work when I started).

Tried Topamax for a month, did not relieve aura symptoms and cause terrible insomnia and was giving me terrible side effects.

Switched away from stubborn doc, went to specialist, had MRI, EEG, and other test to make sure of the diagnosis, and was prescribed this (500mg/day), worked within a few days. I was back to my normal self.

No aura symptoms, and greatly controlled headache pain (only occasional ""sinus pain"" caused by migraine remained). I was prescribed amitryptiline 25 mg/day for this pain and IBS burning, I only take it occasionally not regularly. 

The low dose of amitryptiline seemed to augment the positive effects of the Depakote (at first would have some very minor prickling or stinging paid from the combo, but it went away in a month and wasn't a problem).

I get a rash 8 hours after I put on sunscreen, but I think this happened once before when I wasn't even taking Depakote (I wasn't taking anything as a recall). 

No noticeable side effects from Depakote at first. 

I gained 20 lbs over a year, but it might've been from my thyroid being underactive (this was found later on, and is not necessarily related to the depakote according to my doctor). Also might've been because my appetite returned because I was feeling healthy again.

The insomnia I experienced from Topamax disappeared after switching to this. However, I have not tried the new generic, and my insurance is forcing to do the generic the next time I refill."
