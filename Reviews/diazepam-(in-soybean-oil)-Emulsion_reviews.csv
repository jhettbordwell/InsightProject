0$Condition: Other$3/28/2008 5:48:14 PM$Reviewer: LADY X, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I WAS PUT IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF SEVERE MUSCLE SPASMS IN THE ABDOMEN AREA. I WAS GIVEN MORPHINE AND DIAZEPAM THROUGH AN IV. THE DIAZEPAM HELPED ME EVEN MORE THAN THE MORPHINE DID. HOWEVER, ONE DAY AFTER I WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL, I NOTICED THAT THE LEFT SIDE OF MY FACE WAS DROOPING. I KNEW THAT I HAD NOT HAD A STROKE, AND I'VE TAKEN MORPHINE MANY TIMES AND I'VE NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF SIDE EFFECT. SO EVEN THOUGH THE DIAZEPAM WAS GREAT FOR MY PAIN, I BELIEVE IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS VERY ODD SIDE EFFECT.
