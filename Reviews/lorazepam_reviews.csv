If your a heavy user with multiple types of drugs for the same problems (I.E. taking with Paxil etc.) you're not really gonna know how effective it is. If your not mixing it with other things it works much better.

I’ve read some bad reviews of it on the internet but I cannot believe it doesn’t work for everyone. My pharmacist recently started carrying ONLY Leading Pharma lorazepam....so after years of taking Watson made lorazepam I’m getting a bit concerned. Any positive reviews of Leading Pharma lorazepam would be very helpful.

My chemo requires me to take a significant dose of steroids at each treatment. It is considered part of my Chemotherapy and cannot be lowered in dose or frequency. After my 2nd cycle of chemo, I began to experience ""roid rage."" At first I laughed it off and was like ""OMG! This is a real thing!"" The humor wore off quickly as this rage became down right dangerous and completely uncontrollable. I at the urging of the bone marrow transplant team's Psychiatrist, I started taking 5 mg of lorazepam the morning of my chemo, and in the evening after it, and then twice a day for 48 hrs  I cannot express the relief that I and my family feel now. Our safety was a real concern, let alone fighting a deadly cancer. This medication simply removed the rage associated with Dexamethasone. It put me and everyone around me at ease, and is making us far more ready for the bone marrow transplant."

20$Condition: Anxious$4/4/2017 12:11:24 PM$Reviewer: Shelley, 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$This is a wonderful drug for the treatment of anxiety, however, it is meant for short term use (2-3) weeks. The doctors tell you that, they do not, however, tell you what can happen if you take for a long period of time. I have been taking Lorazepam for 6 years, 1 mg/twice a day. Prior to that I was on Xanax for 10 years.I have now become tolerant and am having withdrawal symptoms. I have done quite a bit of research on this and withdrawal can last years or even decades. This drug needs to be tapered off VERY slowly for a minimum of about 10 months. Some people have terrible withdrawal symptoms for years after stopping this medication. It messes with the Gaba receptors in your brain as well as your central nervous system. Read the Ashton Manual. Doctors keep prescribing these types of drugs because they are getting kickbacks from 'Big Pharma' to do so. Do your research and get off this horrible drug if you have been on for a long time.

I discovered it was great for sleep, with no hang over, like most sleeping pills give. After of 40 years of drinking daily, I recently quit with little problems. First by no alcohol in house for 3 months, and then switching to soda in the bar. I am sober for 3 weeks. I quit for heart problems, and don't intend on going back. I just realized lorazapam reduces effects of alcohol withdraw. Thank you for helping me sleep, and quitting drinking. 2 mg. at bed time.

28$Condition: Anxious$6/21/2016 9:13:54 AM$Reviewer: Andrew813, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I was first given Vyvanse to my ADHD - but after a few years I was having more anxiety. I also had a lot going on in my life. I was prescribed Lorazepam ..5 mg to be used twice or day or as I felt I needed it. It worked a little but now I'm up to 2mg twice a day. I like to take one to go to bed at night as sometimes i can't turn off my brain and fall asleep. I like to take the other during the day while working which helps control my anxiety in dealing with people and projects. I may have the doctor walk back the dose to 1mg as I think I'd function better. my side effects are constipation, doesn't like alcohol, drowsiness. feeling of fullness.

36$Condition: Other$10/29/2015 12:17:27 PM$Reviewer: almostdisabled, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$Starting taking this drug 2 years ago in conjunction with antidepressant, Ambien and multiple pain meds to treat severe fibromyalgia pain, anxiety & sleeplessness.  I take this before bed to calm down enough to let the Ambien work. I am off the pain meds but may never be off the rest.  I tried to go off lorazepem once and suffered panic attacks.  I have developed a tolerance for this and may have to ask for a higher dosage (now at 1 mg an hr before bed & another 1 mg with the Ambien).  I would prefer to be pill free but this drug has been a life-saver.  At one point, I thought I would be disabled and I am still working.  Don't take this for more than a few weeks if you don't have to but if you have to, it can make a big difference in how you function or whether or not you function.  You may have to accept that it is a permanent part of your life if on long-term.

I felt very calm, more focused to get things done and not so scrabbled brain.  Then it was time to take the Sertaline...WOW...this pill doesnt work with me at all (only on it a week, 50mg). Going to tell Doctor on Friday to keep me on the Lorazepam, maybe even higher dose, and take me off Sertaline.

I'm a combat vet. I was driving down the road one day feeling fine when out of the blue I felt like i was having a heart attack.I stop at a near by fire station and they say all my vitals are fine. better than fine even. after several more of these incidents the VA says i'm having panic attacks. and prescribes me lorazepam as needed. It worked from get go. And it works within minutes for me. it's helped me allot over the last 6-7 years. Anybody with panic attacks that feel like heart attack (all the exact same symptoms of a heart attack)this medication may help you out.

My psychiatrist has had me taking these pills as needed for over a year now.  They come in handy whenever I’m feeling stressed, am about to go in a stressful situation, or feel anxious while trying to switch over depression medications.  It can make me feel calm, though not necessarily happy.  I find that it has less effect if I start taking it too often for too long, but overall it has been a helpful medicine.  I recommend taking it as needed whenever you feel yourself start getting anxious.  Don’t wait until you’re entirely bogged down in anxiety!

Always a racing mind and the feeling of anxiousness all the time making me sick. My first dose was like the miracle drug. Within 30 minutes or so I started to feel much better, in fact I really didn't notice I was feeling better until I thought about it. It brought back my appetite and helps me fall asleep and stay sleeping. My mind is not racing anymore either. My concern is stopping this drug. I've heard nightmare stories about withdrawing off of this drug, if abused. But if you take it for more than 6 months, you're already ""addicted"" to it and WILL get severe withdrawals if you stop suddenly. For now it's working for me, but I know I can't stay on this medication for too long.   "

My doctor started me on this in addition to an anti-depressant, because my anxiety stops me from taking that last step to swim, go out to lunch, have a relaxed, honest conversation with people who are close to me, picking up the phone...you get what I mean, I hope. It is a very low dose- 1mg. up to four times a day. It does seem to quiet the anxiety and if I push myself I can do the things (above) that I would really like to do. However, even this low dose adds to my constant fatigue, which might just be a psychosomatic (?) symptom in the first place, I don't know. What I am trying to say is that this helps me sometimes to get out of myself and do things that make me nervous because I know if I would just do them, I will probably have a lot of fun from the experience.

I have had stressful sleep for years and have a really hard time staying asleep due to anxiety.  I'd rather have 5 hours a night of good sleep vs. 8 hours of stressful sleep.  It's like not sleeping at all.  The doctor said I need to take 1mg at night before bedtime to sleep well.  She said that taking it just once a day will not cause physical addiction because the half life is 12 hours.  So she said it's important to break that 12 hour cycle up to prevent physical addiction.  She said if I take it for a long time, less than 12 hours apart, apparently that's when you can get physically addicted.  The doctor said I may end up psyhologically addicted, but that's easy to kick shortly after I stop taking it.  1mg an hour before I want to go to sleep works absolutely great.  I haven't slept so good since I was a kid.  The doctor said that the only real side effects from this drug are addiction, and it's very important to get good sleep or I'll end up with other problems, like high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney problems, increased stress, etc.  So I feel any possible side effects of long term use of this drug is probably worth it.  I feel great, am probably healthier overall from it, and can get more out of life now that I don't have to walk around like a sleepless zombie all day.

It has recently stopped working (nearly 2 years later) and if I don't take it every night then I go into severe withdrawal the next day. I recently wasn't able to take it for a few days and went into full withdrawal with severe anxiety, cold sweats, and shaking. after talking to my doctor about this it is apparently very common.

Worked pretty good for me, after cutting them down! Just had one problem.

I worked 10 hr shifts at night, 5:00pm to 3:00am, with 20 minute paid break for lunch, 4 nights a week. After working the last night for the week I took one of these at 3:20:am Fri. to help relax and go to sleep. Woke up late afternoon Sat. Can't remember anything I did for over 36 hrs! A married Lady friend told me I called her to come over for coffee at 8:00am Fri & acted like a fool all day, would only put on a pair of purple silk boxer shorts I had, & refused to get dressed in anything else. She managed to keep me in the house all day and got me to go to sleep around midnight. I had no memory of any of this at all!

I am instructed to take these pills PRN(as I need it.)  I take ativan when stress builds and my anxiety/mania starts to effect me or when my palsy spasms get painful.  The lorazepam calms all these things.  Me getting to take the ativan whenever I get symptoms instead at a set time (say at night)works out really well and I get the full benefit of the drug when I really need it.

It does relieve anxiety and helps me sleep at which I have trouble with both.  However, if you don't spaace out your dosages (example, 1mg every two to three days)and take it every night for more than four weeks, when you try not taking it for a night, you will have troulbe falling asleep, at least I do.  It is now 3:10am and have to be to work by 8:00am and am up looking at these reviews to see if my symtoms are common.  From what I have read so far, it seems that most people when they try to stop taking Lorazepam, have a hard time going to sleep.  Scary, for me, when I can't sleep, the anxiety attacks occur.  I have tried many sleep aids but none tried so far work as well as this med but, it comes with a price.

My primary DR prescribed .5 mg per day as needed.  I admit I take Ativan (Lorezepam) to sleep or to relax when I take long road trips and not necessarily for Anxiety.  But...here is the bad part...a few months ago, I noticed hair in the drain.  Hair in the sink.  The pillow.  Everywhere.  I did not have thick hair anyway, but now, my ponytail is so thin and limp, the hair loss is really bad.   At first I was told Ativan was not the cause.  Now, I see, it certainly can be.  So, I am taking a tiny .025 dose a day to get off of it.  I guess I will have to find another way to sleep and relax because losing hair makes me far less calm than anything else!  BEWARE if you want your HAIR!

Worked great-no side effects. With sleep I am perfect during the day. But my Dr. will only prescribe it along with an antidepressant, so now on zoloft too-side effects-weight gain/sexual-Ugh...not happy about that. Benzos like ativan are addicting though and she wants me to eventually ween off the ativan and stay on the zoloft only. I tried this last year and couldnt just get off the ativan, so I weened off both slowly after a year with no problems...had 8 months med free...5 good months then 3 struggling...and now the need to start all over. Now have to try to come off it again and stay on the zoloft. I take one .5 at 5pm and two .5 at 9pm. Slept thru the night for the first time in a very long time. Tonight I will stop the 5 pm one as I want to keep the dose as low as possible. On zololt 25mg now...going up to 50 next week per Drs orders, but I'd like to stay at 25 and just might.

It has worked well and kept me functioning all these years. I was put on this at Ochners Clinic in New Orleans. My present Dr. says I am doing better than any of his other fibro patients and does not want me to change to anything else. I also take 50mg of Loudiomil at bedtime to help me sleep. These have been a lifesaver for me. I know i am addicted to this medicine but the fibro pain is unbearable without it. I take very little pain medication. I am 65 years old now and play 18 holes of golf several times a week. I saw recently they were experimenting with ativan for fibro treatment. I can tell you factually that it works and I owe my life to the Drs. at Ochners who were years ahead of other Centers in the treatment of Fibromialgia.

314$Condition: Chronic Trouble Sleeping$4/10/2010 11:44:50 AM$Reviewer: Lily in Boston, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $3$3$5$I've been taking Lorazepam (or Ativan) for two years for menopausal insomnia.  Of all the drugs I've tried, it has been the most helpful with the least side effects. I try not to take it every night and go off it for months at a time. It was most effective when I first started taking it; I quickly developed a tolerance and needed a higher dose which I didn't want to take so I just continued to take .5 or less. I generally take .25. It does help me fall asleep and wake up less often and sleep more soundly.  It only makes me a little groggy and the withdrawal symptoms when I stop taking it have been minimal--headache and slightly shaky feeling. I don't like being dependent on any drug but it's better than not sleeping! There are times when it's been a great relaxant and stress reliever.

It helped me sleep and reduced mild anxiety.  My prescription was for 45 tablets, and I didn't attempt to renew the prescription.  So I stopped cold, and now after reading the data sheet on the drug, realized that was a mistake.  I went through about a 3-day withdrawal, during which I felt somewhat like a clockspring that had been wound too tight.  Great difficulty sleeping and a constant feeling that something ominous was about to happen.  Be careful taking this drug.  I've recently learned it was one of the drugs contributing to Michael Jackson's death.

Lorazepam has been very beneficial in my treatment by curbing my desires to drink and has given me most gratifying sleep that i have so sought for many years. Lorazepam has put balance in my life, and has removed the fear of my unknown future, replaced by reassured hope.

I was prescribed 1 mg. every 8 hours or as needed 5 days ago. They also gave me a dose of it in the hospital via IV. I have taken it the past 4 days in a row with no side effects except I feel calmer, happier and a little sleepy but still totally functional. I started taking it in the evening so if I had any side effects maybe I could sleep through them. I am taking it earlier each day so I can benifit from the calming effects more. I am still only taking 1 pill a day. I am worried about possible side effects that could happen and addiction. But I don't want to stop taking it because it is really helping. (BTW I was in the hospital for a kidney infection not anxiety, the dr. felt I was having anxiety) Most of the reviews so far have been very positive, can anyone give me some advice on what side effects are most common, how soon side effects happen,(I've been taking it 5 days now) and how addicting it actually is? I don't really take much medicines, just tylenol and I take some herbal remidies like ST. Johns wort and Evening Primrose Oil.

374$Condition: Anxious$9/18/2009 2:13:41 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I first was diagnosed with Autism, Bipolar, Depression and then anxiety. This medication has helped me sleep at night along with two hydrocodone for chest wall pain. I only take the two at night thoguh because both make you feel sleepy. The Bipolar has been ruled out and so has the depression. There is still Autism at times but this medication is wonderful for anxiety and panic attacks that come at any level (whether strong or moderate). I am both a Certified Nursing Assistant and Emergency Medical Technician and find the Ativan especially helpful on very stressfull days and alot of those days just happen to fall on the day i am having chest wall pain. So If you have chest pain with your anxious feelings try adding a little bit of hydrocodone with your dr's persmission. When you get anxious your muscles tighten up as well, even your throat and airway. Hope this helps for some of you because it sure helped me.

I recently became inusured and have seeker treatment.  I have now been on Lorazapam for a few days only in addiion to Prestique.  The Lorasapam has saved my once desperate life, it has worked so well I can now absorb the great things and people around me and feel like I am calm and pleasant company.

I used to wake up in the middle of the night and once my brain started thinking I could not go back to sleep. I find this drug works with you. If you are going to sleep it slows your mind down so you can sleep. If you take it during the day for anxiety it slows your anxious thinking down but does not make you (me) lethargic. I take 2mg a night and very rarely during the day. I guess it's a good thing that I am scared to not take as directed. One side note. I went away for the night and did not have any and my sleep was very restleness and I woke up a lot. I hope this only means that the drug is working as it is supposed to and if you don't have it you are back to where you started. Addiction is scary to me. Can you be addicted even if you take as directed and never up the dose?

Yes, the pill is addictive because when I weaned myself off of them, I started having anxiety attacks, and my asthma symptoms came back.  I tried to not touch the bottle of pills, but finally resorted to it because I would have fainted or lost it if I didn't have them.

I only take as needed and now I pretty much carry the bottle in my purse as a saftey blanket, but rarely have to actually take a pill. However, if you are taking this for anxiety it should not be the only thing you are taking for your condition. You need to be on a everyday medication as well, this will decrease your need to take the pill and decrease your chances of dependancey. My Dr. will not perscribe this medication alone, I have to take my Effexor to get this script. But when you have a bad bout with anxiety, this is a great pill to have handy!! Usually brings me down in about 5 minutes. Also useful for help sleeping,I normally take Ambien everynight but if it gets to late or I don't feel like taking the Ambien, 1 or 2 of these and I am fast asleep....usually for the entire night!

It is very addictive and I sometimes find myself running out before I'm able to get it refilled.  If used properly, very effective.

Now down to 1 .05 at bedtime, after 5 nights it stopped working at that dose. I started getting anxiety bec I could not sleep and decided to take a Sonata sleeping pill (trying not to take sleeping pills..) Next night, I went back to 2 pills .05 Lorazepam which always worked and it did not! I took another Sonata just to get to sleep. Now I am thinking after 4 months, my body is intolerant to my cutting down on the dose. I think its time to get off. I hear its very hard to quit. Try not to up the dose, once your body tells you it needs to up the dose, its time to get off, unless you do not care about its addicting qualities.

For those who understand how debilitating anxiety and insomnia are, you will find the calming effects of this drug a welcome relief. Works miracles on relieving anxiety and helping to fall asleep. Only downside is that if I stop taking it even for one night, I sleep very lightly, have lots of dreams, and wake up often.  I recommend only taking it at night if possible, because it does cause drowsiness and mild dizziness.

It seems particularly valuable in situations where my anxiousness is so great that I am unable to concentrate at work. It calms me considerably thus allowing me to be more productive.

However there is a trade off. My mental acuity is not as sharp and it gives me the feeling of being slightly intoxicated. Not surprisingly it lowers my energy level and makes me feel slightly sleepy. Yet still a good trade off versus a panic freeze that makes me completely dysfunctional. Also I've discover that it is best to use the smallest dose possible that will still allow me to derive the benefit without experiencing the hazy side effects. I often break the one milligram pill in half or even quarters. 

I try never to use it more than 2 days in a row for fear of addiction.

I also use it at night for insomnia that results from racing mind syndrome. Used in conjunction with ambien, I never fails to get me to sleep and usually sleep 8 hours or more. (Wouldn't suggest this for those who have any side effects with ambien). I do have a slight hang over effect from the lorazepam which makes it hard to hit the ground running in the morning, but not as bad as the hangover you get from a night of drinking. 

Overall, I've had a good experience... and it certainly has saved many a day I would have otherwise just been pacing the floor... wringing my hands over an anxiety attack. "

548$Condition: Anxious$2/13/2008 11:29:30 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed this drug by my physician after reporting I had shortage of breath and chest pains, numbness in my arms and dizziness. After talking about the situations when these symptoms took place and some additional testing he determined I was having panic attacks. I was told to take 1/2 of pill when I felt an attack coming on. It worked and has consistently for more than 2-years. I don't take it daily, only when I feel an attack or when I know I'm going to be in a situation that might bring one on. Also, I was diagnosed with IBS, usually also brought on by stressful situations (public speaking, meetings, etc) and this is resolved by taking the medication as well. I have, however, increased the dosage to one entire pill. If I don't use it for more than a couple weeks and then take it, side effects such as slight lightheaded-ness or dizziness, but not enough to make me not want to take it by any means. My physician put me on a very low dosage of Prozac to take on a daily basis to replace the Lorazepam because he was afraid I might develop a dependency, but I still occasionally would need the Lorazepam for panic attacks. I have quit taking the Prozac and only rely on the Lorazepam for attacks or prevention because I was never taking it regularly enough to develop dependency. I appreciate the calmness, decrease of worry and sense of ease resulting from the drug and the lack of any negative side effects.

564$Condition: Involuntary Quivering$1/3/2008 8:54:07 AM$Reviewer: SallyCoyote, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I am taking chemo, and not sleeping at all on chemo nights once a week.  I would lie awake for 6 hours and then sleep about an hour and a half. The chem Dr's. staff suggested this medication. I took it last night and was awake nearly all night again. I cat napped from midnight to 3:17 a.m., and then did not sleep again. The dosage says to take one, and nothing about taking two if the one doesn't do the job.  I'm disappointed and will call my medical people to check into a possible alternative.
