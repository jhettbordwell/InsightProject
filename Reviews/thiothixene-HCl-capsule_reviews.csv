It was very effective as a once moderate daily dose for about 3 years but I had to stop using it due to tardive dyskenesia as well as amenorrhea - I managed to get pregnant twice despite condoms and foam but didn't notice since the drug took my period away after about a year and I hadn't had a period for that time. then found out I was 3 months pregnant, and p[rescribed a therapeutic abortion. This then happened almost immediately afterwards, again... so between that and the twitches and facial spasms I stopped taking the Navane.
