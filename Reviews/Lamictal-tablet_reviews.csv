0$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/2/2019 1:19:58 PM$Reviewer: Anxious driver , 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$2$Iâ??ve been on only 25 mg for a few weeks and have read so many scary horrible reviews about the side effects Iâ??m afraid to go up to 50 mg. Iâ??ve watched every lamictal you tube video review, and read every article online I can find, and continue to worry this drug was prescribed to me incorrectly by a psychiatrist who saw me for the first time for literally only 5 minutes. I donâ??t even know if he thinks Iâ??m bipolar. I told him how I felt, he wrote me a script for this, and I was out the door. I went home to research the drug, and panicked more by the side effects I read. He told me there were no side effects with lamictal! What a lie. He said itâ??s the gentlest of all of these types of drugs. I know I have GAD anxiety 
1$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/8/2019 3:37:20 PM$Reviewer: Elle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have bipolar II disorder. I stopped medication for about 3 years because I felt myself stabilizing. I never had any major episodes, but I tend to be more hypomanic than depressed. I decided to start taking medication again because although I could function, it was a daily struggle to manage my moods.
More mature and in tune to my mental health, I communicated my needs and concerns to my new psychiatrists. Like I said, Im more manic, so in the past when doctors prescribed me an anti-depressant, it would make me even more anxious and irritable. I also did not want a medication that caused weight gain because I have had an eating disorder in the past and didnt want weight gain to trigger that.
My doctor recommended lamictal (only). He gave me the ""rash"" warning and told me I may not feel better for a few weeks while he slowly increases my dosage...
I am completely astounded! I have only been taking lamictal for a few days, so Im not sure why he says it takes weeks. I have not even taken it for 2 weeks and I have so much energy and motivation. I have cleaned my apt (long overdue), got school supplies early, usual stressors at work dont phase me! 
It is not a medication that makes you feel super joyful or too dim. I feel like it just lifts the bipolar cloud from your life. I just feel like I can fully function! Everybody is different, but if your mental situation is similar to mine, definately give lamictal a try!

FYI...I dont remember ever reviewing a medication. Hope this helps someone! God bless you."

3$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/28/2019 1:59:02 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been on so many medications for my depression over the last 14 years, it was so bad that I was almost disabled and I am only 34 years old, a wife, mother of two, full time nurse. I had given up on finding medication to help me and was looking into ect therapy. My nurse practitioner recommended lamictal, I was so skeptical but agreed to try it. After a couple of weeks paired with my other medications I could see a difference in my mood and energy levels. I had feelings of happiness and before it was only flat affect or sadness. I was very resistant to touch prior to the lamictal, with the addition of the medication, my touch aversion went almost completely away. Dont get me wrong, I take several other psyc medications, but the addition of lamictal was a big game changer for me.

It was always plain pink, now it has white flecks in the pink. They insist the formula wasn't changed- THEY LIE. The reaction I had to their ""unchanged formula almost caused the worst depression ever. They insist they specks were just a result of the processing of the pill. "

I never thought I was bipolar but I had a severe manic episode 30 year ago so she said try lamictal...500mg I was great and changed my life for 3 years.

8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/26/2018 12:14:19 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$2$1$I was on lamictal for Bipolar Depression II. It helped significantly with my mood swings and anger/mania and I actually loved the effect it had for helping with stabilizing me in general. The side effects unfortunately were too difficult for me to deal with. I gained 30 pounds in three weeks, from the medication as I was retaining too much water and sort of swelled up. It also didn't really help my anxiety and caused panic attacks when I was feeling more depressed than normal.

11$Condition: Rapid Cycle Manic-Depression$4/15/2018 5:06:04 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$"I have been on Effexor, Buspirone, Zoloft, Trazadone, Wellbutrin, Prozac, Klonopin over the years and this was by far the worst reaction I've ever had with a med. I was started on 25mg to move up after 1 week to 50 and was on it 5 days. The first few days I had severely painful headaches with pressure, my face twitches, my eyes rolled and darted back and forth and my jaw was clenched constantly. I had an extremely painful and stiff neck. Day 3 the pain was in all my muscles and joints and I had tremors. Day 5 and things got so bad I nearly went to an ER. 9 pm at night I started feeling like I was having a panic attack (I do have panic disorder). It felt as if my chest was in a vice grip and I couldn't breathe, my heart was beating rapidly/starting and stopping, pounding, I could see it pulse through my stomach. I had cramping in my abdomen and my neck was so stiff I couldn't move it. I did not sleep but more than that I couldn't move for hours. I laid in the fetal position completely wide eyed and in a state of what I mistook to be panic. My panic attacks have never lasted more than an hour or two. This lasted for 16 hours. I had to work in the morning and went to work on 0 sleep and all of symptoms kept worsening. I also had class but decided to go home to try to sleep because I was in so much pain. I started to put two and two together when everything in my body lit on fire. It felt like I had a sunburn, especially on my chest and back and neck. I called my prescriber and they said to stop taking it and to take the hydroxyzine because ""it sounds like the beginning of an allergic reaction"" as well as adverse effects. That makes it sound like they're competent and concerned...they aren't. They pushed this drug on me even though I was hesitant. It's five days later and only now am I starting to feel slightly back to normal but my face is still clenching and ticking and I'm still in pain. It took a few days for my pulse to even out, too. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS EVER"

It really helps my mood and anxiety.  I can’t say enough great things about it!  Be careful of the manufacturer though, because generics vary 20% from brand.  I prefer Teva Lamotrigine above all others and Cipla is the very worst.

I did not find this drug helpful, and I had two years of hell getting off of it.  It rightly has a black box from the FDA. The side effects started only a few months after I began taking it, and a neurologist recommended that I stop taking it .  But, it isn't easy to get off of it. The side effects intensified. I am now off.
I want to let others know about Point of Return, a website with wonderful people who assist in tapering from pharmaceuticals. Check in there. They are super supportive and have a lot of excellent information.  The other thing that I found to be helpful was reflexology. This is a kind of acupuncture that is acupressure, done on the feet or hands on specific points. If you are having side effects, try it. Holding everyone who is struggling with this drug or any other pharmaceutical in Love!  You are not alone!!!

15$Condition: Rapid Cycle Manic-Depression$1/27/2018 5:41:28 PM$Reviewer: ET, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I got off zyprexa 6 months ago due to weight gain. I gained 130lbs on it. Zyprexa was the only drug I tried out of many that worked. After that I destabilized and had rapid mood swings and stopped sleeping. I found a new psychiatrist and he put me on Lamictal and Geodon. Within a month my mood swings greatly improved. And within 2 months I felt like a normal healthy human being again and my mood swings were relieved. Now, I no longer feel depressed or manic. I just feel happy all the time. I don't have anxiety anymore. I don't have depression anymore. I don't worry or get upset about every little thing anymore. This drug combo is like a miracle to me. Very easy to use with no side effects at all.

Symptoms have decreased dramatically. I have noticed however that I get a funny taste in my mouth on a regular basis (every 2-3 weeks for about a week at a time) and I have muscle tightness in neck and shoulder. Other than that, it is helpful for me .

I am able to function and although I'm not out there running around full of joy and happiness. I am able to lead a life and not sit in bed moping all day. It helps level out my emotions as well which range from completely depressed to just uncomfortable and unhappy to normal with little onslaughts of sadness here and there. I wouldn't be able to have a life without it so it's definitely worth trying .

I was hospitalized at 117. Be careful on this drug. It has been a miracle drug for 8 years for my bipolar. I lowered dose from 200 mg to 100 mg and my sodium in 1 weeks time is back up to only 2 points below so I doubt I'll have to come all the way off of it. It's been a miracle and I love it. Just beware and have your sodium checked. Low sodium is serious!!!!

32$Condition: Manic-Depression$7/9/2016 3:17:41 PM$Reviewer: Tom in Chicago, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I have been on Lamictal for years, and to tell you the truth, I don't know what it does for me.  I don't mean what its for.  I mean for me.  You know how you have favorite medications and others that are on the sidelines.  This is a sideline drug for me.  I don't even know if it works.  See, I experience bad mania (I should mention I'm 40 years old, a male, and have bipolar type 1), not so much depression, though let's not discount it.  While being on Lamictal I was experiencing manic episodes left and right.  It wasn't until I came back to Lithium that my moods were stabilized.  So I am unconvinced of it effectiveness.  But this is just my experience.  I was put on 400mg at first, after tapering up on it to avoid the dangerous rash, and stayed there for years.  Then I began noticing memory problems.  I would have entire conversations and then repeat myself later.  I would forget things.  I became a time traveler, in short.  In consultation with my doctor we decided to cut back.  I went to 200mg and then settled at 100mg, where I am now.  Now I am on hardly any Lamictal and I still don't know what its for.  I hope one of you find out and that it works wonders for you.

I've used additional medications with it over time but they have all lost their effectiveness as is common for bipolar disorder. I've tried reducing or even stopping Lamictal at times but always go back. It truly does stabilize extreme emotions. As for side effects, it's hard to lose weight and above 300mg I have issues with thinking, focusing and sometimes hallucinations or nightmares. That was at 400-600 mg. Its a reliable base for bipolar disorder for me.

My pharmacist recognized them in 3 sec. when she looked at my med list. The drug turned my brain to Jello. I will list them in no particular order.  Getting lost for <30 miles while going to dr. Going to church on Tues. at midnight, falls with fractures, needing a cane then a walker, double vision, blurred vision, (of course no driving),slurred and very slow speech, limited vocabulary and problems with word finding, confusing, memory loss,severe tremors--total body, 5-7 day a week home care and physical therapy because I could not maintain my personal care.  My life consisted of eat, sleep(most of the time, pee and go to the dr.  This past year was complete hell.  Both drs. told me I was just anxious and this symptoms were part of my mental disorder.  I weaned myself off and the switch flipped after 3 days and improved by ? in 7 days. Stevens-Johnson isn't the only problem that drs. need to watch for (look beyond the black box warnings!), Patients need to listen to what your body and R.Ph tells you.  Both drs. dropped their jaw when I skipped into their offices.

I have not been sleepy or groggy as many of the anti-depressants made me. I also do not feel any changes in appetite like the anti-depressants seemed to make me eat more. I sleep well and have not had dreams that were anymore weird than usual, as some people have stated they had weird dreams on lamictal. I have had a hard time getting up early, I was getting up at 4:30 a.m. but struggle to get out of bed for work because I am resting so well- this could be a good or bad thing, less anxiety but late to work. I do not have racing thoughts and even manage to smile and laugh during the day which is rare for me. In addition, I am getting things done without all of the worry and anxiety. So far so good Lamictal. I will post another update when I increase to 50 mg on 12/29/2015

The Lamictal gave me severe horizontal vertigo, while the Vimpat geve me Vertical vertigo -- and my Dr. wondered why I kept falling.  I ended up in a viscous cycle of falling and seizures that ended up with me in a hell-hole of an assisted living facility.  If my Dr. had only listened to me about the side effects, she could have put me back on Keppra, and all this would have been prevented.  Be sure to tell your Dr. about ANY side effects, and make sure they listen to and understand you.  Don't let them just pat you o0n the back and say they know what's good for you.  If they do, run -- don't walk -- to another Dr. ASAP!

It worked well for both for depression and mania. I had minimal side-effects (a little bit of brain fog). However, it has become completely ineffective for mania (3 episodes this year followed by 1 mild and 1 horrible post-manic depressive bouts).
This was the fifth medication I have been on in the past seven years (they become ineffective after a while... or I stop fooling myself and recognize the symptoms again). I have been on this for 2 years and am up to 350 mg a day with progressively less effectiveness. Will be seeing what to do in a day or two..."

When I was first diagnosed, I was prescribed lithium and sinequin.  I was a zombie so I took myself off them after a few months.  I've been on just about every antipsychotic drug on the market throughout the years. For the past few years I been prescribed 20 mg of citalopram in am and 20 mg of mirtzapine.  Last year, after a depressive episode, my psychiatrist introduced the lamotrigine to my regimen.  I was prescribed 100 mg am and 100 mg pm.  It changed my life.  I haven't felt this clear, focused and level in almost 40 years.  My relationships with my friends and family have been at an all time high.  I have now been decreased to 50 mg in am and 50 mg in pm. and I still feel good.  Still having minor bouts of depression and mania but I am more aware of them and they are less frequent and severe.  I would strongly recommend trying this medication.
58$Condition: Bipolar Disorder in Remission$6/4/2015 7:55:47 PM$Reviewer: Jessica, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$Have been on 800mgs of lamictal for yrs. Only had one hospitalization due to MDs not knowing that blurry vision is a side effect. I also take 450 msg of seroquel after zyprexa failed. Also take 300 msg of welbutrin and 1.5 mg of klonopin. This has been my cocktail for years and seems to work well together. I've had to deal with BP for over 40 yrs. Very light sensitive with SAD in winter. This year had a bout of mania from too much sun. Mania is not fun at all. Have had 4 rounds of ECT during my times when the depression was very serious. It's not bad and doesn't hurt. Highly recommend it. Stops depression on the spot. Lamictal when used with other meds can be a real life saver and it keeps the mood swings farther apart. Nothing can ever cure BP so the best thing to do is structure your life around eating,exercising for those with weight gain plus it gets the endorphins firing off which feels good, getting regular sleep no matter what. The brain relies on structured environments when its biochemistry is out of order. Taking good care of yourself and educating the people around you who care for you and enlisting them to help you see the signs of relapse. Meds and cognitive behavioral therapy are the best you can get. DO NOT GO OFF YOUR MEDS. People with BP will always have it - no magic cure - so figure out ways to keep the swings apart. Taking Lamictal is part of what I do before bed...every night.

Been in this at various doses for over 2 years.  With my other meds, it has worked better than anything I've ever taken, for my major depression, bipolar.  About a year ago i complained to my Dr. About the very uncomfortable feeling in my legs, that happened often, and I couldnt do anything to stop the episodes.  Caused me to pace, couldn't sit still it lie down. It was fidgety leg syndrome, (sounds minor, but it's not when its not ESP when it is occurring frequently). She put me on cogentine for the side effects.  I don't have fidgety legs anymore.  I've had a terrible dry mouth that makes it very difficult to talk, or swallow.  My legs tighten up with my feet in a curled up position, very tightly, while lieing down.  While standing, my calves are very still tight and my big toe on my left foot stats extended upward and all other toes in a cramped position.  It is almost constant, as much as I try to relax or stretch it doesn't go away.  I've told my dr of this many times and she continues to lower my dose of Lamictal and its 'side effect cure"" cogetin.  Still there, but very much improved.  No improvement on my tightened legs, feet  and body at  I don't know what to do.  Not sure which is causing it, and since my depression has improved so much, (with the help of meds and very intense therapy).  These side effects are to difficult to ignore and to deal with. "

( Meditation and good friends helped me get to the point where I was. While I wasn’t totally cured or anything, I was in a good place. But my seizures were getting worse so I went along with it,) She said that if I started to get severe side effects( among which is a deadly rash) that I could “JUST QUIT”. Full stop, no tapering or anything just “flush ’em” and go on my merry way. From the get go I noticed that it’s making me really scatter brained. I’m still going to college, I can’t be off in lala land while i’m trying to listen to my professor. It also was making me more depressed and more anxious then I’ve been in years, totally steam rolling all the progress I had made. So, I naively did what she said, and quit them cold turkey. I have never been so violently ill in all my life. It was like coming of Heroine or something not a prescribed medicine. I shook for four days, could barely keep a quarter of a cup of liquid at a time before it came back up, I couldn’t eat for THREE days, and to put the cherry on top, I had the worst Depression of my life. I had to ask my Grandma to move me into the living room, so I wouldn’t be alone with myself, because I was so scared of what I might do. I think I may actually be coming out the other side, but I’m so physically and emotionally drained, I fells like I’m dead inside. It wasn’t till LITERALLY this morning that I found this site, and several more like it, warning people of the side effects and that unless you’re a titan or a demi-god you HAVE to gradually tapper off. IDK what my doc is in some pharmaceutical companies pocket or if she was just that uninformed, but I am NEVER taking that pill again and I’m going to put in a request for a new Doctor, cause this is completly unexceptable.

My weight is 190 lbs. Taking 200 mg lamotrigine with breakfast for about three weeks now. Experiencing little to no side effects. My dreams are more vivid and sometimes bizarre, but not nightmarish. Feeling pleased with this medicine. Also been taking Wellbutrin for the past year. Prior to my bipolar diagnosis I went through four SSRI antidepressants (Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, and Lexapro). Each of these meds pushed me into mania to varying degrees. While on SSRIs and manic, I created three unwanted pregnancies, got busted for drugs, developed a cigarette habit, quit several good jobs for petty reasons, became a heavy drinker, had short and failed relationships with women, spent money foolishly, and went bankrupt. Mine is one of the sad stories of people who went untreated/misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and proceeded to cause a lot of hardship for myself and others. To this day I still feel shame for my failures, yet at the same time I berate myself less since understanding the cause of my past behavior. My cigarette habit went away after I switched from SSRIs to Wellbutrin. Now I feel healthier and grateful. No cravings whatsoever. I take 1 mg Ativan as needed; about every one to six days. I wish I received my bipolar diagnosis 20+ years ago as my life might be very different now. I still have many years left if all goes well, so better late than never.

Some SSRIs/SNRIs give you too much energy and actually make your urges more difficult to tolerate. If you take this as a stand alone for mood disorders then you will be disappointed. It is the safest alternative to any other mood disorder drug. Sad to hear other people's issues while taking Lamictal.

I take it in the mornings with my Cymbalta 60mgs and Adderall 20mgs. Today I started 50mgs of Lamictal and I have had the weirdest changes in mood all day long until finally settling into this reeeallly drowsy state where all I want to do is lay in bed. I can't focus on anything and my afternoon dose of Adderall was pretty much wasted because I still couldn't focus due to being so tired.

I've read that most people don't REALLY start feeling less swings until 100mgs, and that the therapeutic dose is 200mgs. So I am going to stick it out and I have a psych appointment tomorrow to get his opinion. But today has been rough and I'm out of klonopin until tomorrow as well because we recently lowered that significantly. 

I'm hoping this really weird drowsy/tired/sleepy/no motivation/no energy/no emotions/blah/netflix-binge mood is not how this medicine will make me feel for very long. I didn't really notice any effects at 25mgs, but today, my first day on 50mgs has been rough. Had a panic attack earlier and then settled into this mood.

Anyway, back to Lamictal, my psych instructed me to take 25mgs 1x daily for 2 weeks. This is day 4 and it seems like it is making me more depressed and just really irritated and blah feeling especially in the late afternoon/evenings. I have been on all of these other medications in the past and never had an issue with any of them. Lamictal is the only new thing added to that cocktail. After the 2 weeks are up, I go to 50mgs a day. I just feel kinda apathetic, annoyed, and very low energy at night and I take it in the mornings with my Cymbalta and Adderall. I need to call my psych Monday to ask if I should push through these first 2 weeks or what... Anyway, that's my experience so far. Hope it changes. I used to be on Abilify for bipolar and never had any problems with it... Maybe he'll switch me back but from what I understand, that's a completely different category of drug. Any input anyone???

I honestly can't say if it's helping me. I do know the side effects are a problem, such as; insomnia, weight gain, upset stomach, stiffness, dizziness, confusion, short attention span, and pain behind my eyes. To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm on Lamictal. I don't have epilepsy and I'm not bi-polar. I've seen two psychiatrists and they each gave me a different diagnosis. I've also been on Zoloft for about 15 years. When I try to look back to the years prior to these drugs, I'm wondering if I should be weaning myself off all together. I used to be very active, but since being on medications, I've gained 70 pounds, I've stopped doing the things I used to enjoy such as camping, fishing, jogging, biking, gardening...etc.... I want my old life back. If I remember correctly, I was originally put on medications due to mood swings and depression. That was when I had four young children at home and we were struggling financially. My kids have grown so maybe its time to make the change.

In December 2010 I attempted suicide and was placed in an intensive outpatient treatment program. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and Anxiety Disorder and was put on Lamictal and Xanax (.50 mg). My therapeutic level for the Lamictal was/is 150mg (200mg caused difficulties sleeping). The Lamictal helped with the depression and ""dark thoughts"". I was on the meds from December 2010 - March 2012 and got cocky and decided I was cured and didn't need the meds anymore (not realizing the truth the meds were doing what they were suppose to do).  At first I was fine but by November 2013 things began spinning out of control with my depression and hypo mania. In May 2014 I was so distraught and spiraled down again that I left work went home and cut myself 17 times. Once again I was back in intensive outpatient treatment but for longer this time. I was put back on the Lamictal the end of May 2014 and once again the ""dark thoughts"" have subsided and I am feeling stronger again (and have managed to deal with four deaths of friends the past three weeks and though my emotions were grief and pain which are expected, the out of control bleakness has not occurred). I have had to come to terms that I will always require med management for my disorder and can not go off my meds again as my ""experiment"" of being fine without them was a complete failure. I am not saying everyone will experience the same results and obviously by the mixed reviews many have not. All I know is after 36 years of medication experimentation Lamictal has proven to be the one which was by far the most effective for me!  (FYI - I experienced no side effects other than sleep difficulties at 200 mg and so it was readjusted back to 150 mg which has proven the best level for me.)"

She lost over 100% of her skin, spent weeks on a ventilator, has had multiple surgeries, including skin grafting, and experiences severe and constant pain. She was young and strong and will be fortunate enough to escape this experience with only extensive scaring, dry eyes, and hypersensitivity to cold and heat.

I have had MDD & Severe Anxiety Since 1989.
I took this medication  (Lamictal) over two years ago.

I decided to write this so others know the possibilities of the medication & because my Doctor's disagrees with the rash ""radius"" and hair loss aspect of the drug (that I experienced).

1)The Lamictal boosted my mood and I had more energy which was awesome. ;)

2) When ever I did anything that caused me to sweat, the sweat felt like Acid. My skin burned, rashed, & became red and bumpy
    
I would immediately rinse off in the shower to stop the burning. 

3) It increased my heart rate, and made me feel panicky at times. 

4) When the sweating was significant enough that my head or scalp became became damp my hair started falling out.

The doctor told me the rash would only occur in the bend of my arms or legs, or if severe enough in the mouth and throat. This is not the case.

My face, scalp, arms and legs.... were burned every time I exerted myself enough to sweat.  

It took over a year for the side effects to dissipate and eventually go away.

I can only hope the people that make this drug, read these comments and update their warning labels, and educate doctors better in the possible side effects.

It's bad enough to deal with the side effects, it's worse to have a doctor
dismiss what you are telling them. 

This drug may work wonderful for some people, and not so well for others. Be aware of the potential side effects, and trust your instincts. If you don't try or take some chances you'll never know.

I am now taking Mirtazapine & Sertraline both in low doses, and feel much better. 

Never Give Up!! "

I had tried just about every other drug there was, with little or no help. Then, in 2010, my dad passed away and sent me into a major spiral. I agreed to try the Lamictal, and it has done wonders for me. I take 300/mg daily, along with Wellbutrin and Celexa. I hate to think of where I might be if I hadn't tried it.

My doses for Seroquel ranges between 100-200mg and Lamictal 25-100mg at various times. I don't exactly know the effects of Lamictal but it worked well with Seroquel. 

It helped stabilize my mood and make things seem a little better. I could take on life again after a year long battle of stress, depression, anxiety & suicidal ideation without medication."

I was taking risperdol, zoloft and Xanax, but was still very depressed. It was to the point that I had stopped eating preppy and could not take care of myself hygienically. I didn't care how I looked, if my coo these were dirty, or if I smelled. I only took a shower every 10-14 days. Basically until I couldn't stand myself any longer and got afraid of being in trouble at my part time job. I finally talked to my doctor about all of this and she put me on lamictal. After four weeks I was on 100mg per day. The difference is night and day. I eat well, take care of myself, and no longer have to worry about my cleanliness. Sometimes I still struggle with the energy to do things I need to do, but for the most part am doing very well. I am taking the lamictal in addition to all the meds listed ate the beginning, even my friend says I am more perky and have a more positive outlook on things instead of being so negative all the time. My dr said I could go up some from where I am if I need to, which I think I can do, but I am feeling emotion again which I haven't done in a long time, Ian very thankful for this drug s it has turned my life around,

I take it mainly for depression, but since reaching perimenopause age, I have a bit of bipolar symptoms.  It is slightly less effective for control bipolar systems such as hyper/hypomania, weight gain, and fatigue.  I do get dizzy more often, and am extremely thirsty all the time (I drink a LOT of water, but I feel like that's healthy). I also notice headaches when I don't take it for a few days. I'm on 350 mg, and it is a right dose for me.  I do also have insomnia, which is not related to the drug by perimenopause. I, however, don't get NEAR as depressed as I used to, and for that I am eternally greatful to the psychiatrist who started me on Lamictal.  I think I'll be taking this drug for a long time, as it really has made my life outlook SO much better.

I was placed on Wellbutrin first, and it improved my mood and energy level.  However, I was still irritable, explosive, quick to anger and intolerant. My doctor put me on 25 mg of Lamictal, and I felt different immediately.  I felt more centered, patient, calmer and mellow.  My employees and husband also noticed the difference in my mood. I went up to 50 mg and, eventually, to 75 mg, my current dose.  I am on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, Wellbutrin SR 100 mg and Lamictal 75 mg.  this combination has changed my life.  I think and communicate more intelligently, and I am more level-headed.  It hasn't changed my personality.  It just stabilized my mood swings. The only side effect since I started Lamictal is forgetfulness.  I was told that folic acid may minimize that.  I'll give it a try. Besides that, I'm extremely happy with Lamictal.

I was prescribed Lamictal because I was told that it was one of the fewer new antiseizure medications that was best for women, and would have a lesser chance of abnormalities found in my children for future references.
I had gained some weight, constantly drowsy, and very few thoughts of suicide. After awhile of taking the medications and increased dosages, my body became used to the symptoms. I've seen about every shape, size and color of Lamictal. If you let the pill begin to desolve in your mouth, there is an awful taste.
Today now at the age of 27, I can say that Lamictal has been the best for me...it is very time sensitive on ""taking your medication"" I could be anywhere of 15 minutes to hours late and chances of having a seizure is increased. My dosage is at its max of 500 mg daily, if my numer of seizures increase the likelihood of prescribed a second antiseizure medications are high.
So far I can say over these past 12 years, I can say I've had roughly 12 seizures throughout my life so far. BUT! I've gone years seizure free (5-7 years free).
My only current concern is if and how it could affect my chances of becoming/being pregnant. My doctor is always suggesting folic acid as well as iron supplements to lessen risks of epilepsy and or abnormalities."

I've always managed, but this fall has been tough emotionally, so my Dr. added Lamictal, started me 25mg 2 weeks, 50mg 2 weeks, then 100 today. I noticed my anxiety began to increase by week 2, then began getting worse, I became more depressed, withdrawn, and worse yet forgetful, I normally can do 10 things at one time...well yesterday I forgot to go to my 2nd job that I have had for 2 years, and then it hit me about all the other side effects with forgetfulness, not sleeping, anxiety to exploding. I called pharmacy right away, because I feel they know medications pretty much better than the Docs. he told me forgetfulness is in 5% of the severe cases, and seeing that was my only med change in over 5 years, well that's a no brainer. I being medication certified do agree you should consult with your Dr. and to be weaned off, not stop suddenly. I'm so glad it is helping so many others.

The only downfall is that unlike my other pills, Lamictal is very potent in taste, and if it touches even a single taste bud, it will fill your mouth with a disgusting taste. Ugh."

I take 100 mgs per day, half at night and half in morning and it still helps tremendously with mood stabilization, HOWEVER, I am also EXTREMELY tired even with great sleep.

You should really think about ever exceeding 150mg to 200mg. I was on almost 600mg for a six month period. I am on 150 a day and its been remarkable. Check and make sure you take it at the exact same time everyday and you will see the headaches lessen. Check your white blood count yearly, I have had bouts of severely decreased white blood count, although it hasn't become a real factor its just alarming. this is the only depression medication I have ever seen that has these limited side affects and the best results.

He started on 25mg and now 75mg and will start 100mg on the 16th.  He's basically very depressed.  He was on Effexor and Seroquel (400mg XR) for some time but developed some breast tissue on the nipple area.  So he stopped Seroquel and started Lamictal as mood stabilizer. After stopping Seroquel, the breast tissues are still there.  The Psychiatrit said there is no the same side effect on boy growing breasts for Lamictal.  However, from some web sites, I saw a lot of women talking about their breasts were signigicantly enlarged for a couple of cups. I also read 2 posts saying one 13-year-old boy and a middle-aged man discribing they have gynecomastia.  Could anyone shed light on this problem?  Is there any document indicating this is a side effect?  Do you have any experience with it?  Seroquel can increase the prolactin level.  I am not sure if Lamictal has the same side effect but works in a different way (estrogen, etc.).  I did read that Effexor has the same side effect but very rare. I only hope my son's problem is not getting worse with the treatment.
Your kind help is very much appreciated."

This confusion etc was misdiagnosed as being of epilepsy origin. They performed an Emergency EEG to prove that it was epilepsy, but forgot to read it for 12 days, leaving her under Drs orders taking the full dose of the drug that was damaging her brain. We are now in hospital with our fourth bout of mania and psychosis, which is quite resistant to medication. She had no psychiatric problems prior to this life changing event three years ago. Incidentally the Lamotrogine made her seizures more frequent and worse, and thankfully we were able to stop it before the twelve days were up due to a dreadful full body rash reaction. Interestingly, her last 4 EEGS prove her to be epilepsy free and she had had no seizures since Aug 20102, after prayer by her pastors, while she was so sick in hospital for a month with her first admission.

Extreme Vitamin D deficiency, which caused profound depression, low energy and lowered immunity. As someone who struggles with depression I could see my depression was not connected to events. The literature indicates that this drug produces liver enzymes hostile to vitamin D. THAT is a problem! I had a level 5.5, should of been 36 or so. That depression-crying for no reason at work!& compromised immunity, extreme fatigue is not uncommon. Follow bipolar groups and you will find a pattern of extreme depression when patients start on it oftentimes. Alot of them complain about it. Be CAREFUL.

This medication has definitely helped even out my lows and highs, but I have experienced many negative side effects. My memory is horrible which makes going to school really difficult and I am sick to my stomach every day. I also have extremely severe anxiety and my doctor told me this medication would help with that, but it hasn't in the slightest. Although this drug is helpful, i'm not sure if it's worth all the side effects.

Drs. trying to wean me off of this to take Dilantin, wanting me to take 1-150 mg of Lamictal & 100mg of Dilantin XR, the Dilantin I need for neuro pain in legs. Felt great for 3 days could walk, after that withdrawal from Lamictal, a sudden rush of nervousness came over me, I never felt this kind of nervousness In my life, I have tried for over 2 mo. to wean off of this drug getting down to 75 mg 2x but I've been a wreck & I cannot, I'm getting too depressed whether its the weaning off the drug along with this disease that would depress anyone. My other Dr. says if the Dilantin worked with the Lamictal why quit taking the Lamictal? Checking on the web I see Dilantin decreases your Lamictal levels, so why in the H would they want to decrease the Lamictal by half dose when the Dilantin would decrease it further making me get this rush of nervousness. I started feeling sick in the head, all I can figure is the Dilantin lowered the Lamictal levels too much causing the rush of nervousness or withdrawl symptoms, or the Lamictal & Dilantin combined caused a weird head.

It has worked wonderfully for my manic episodes. The last two years I was switched to the generic brand by my insurance. During this time I had began getting a serious rash and redness and rash on my neck area, this past year I have developed blotches on my shoulders and upper arms as well as the shoulder blade areas. It is slowly working its way down my arms and back. My doctor gave me an ointment prescription which is working, but has concerns of the effects being related to Lamictal. He is weening me off due to the potential seriousness of this side affect. I am disappointed with this as the drug has worked perfectly for my condition, however, I appreciate his legitimate concern. I almost wonder if the generic brand may be the difference in my skin condition, where it has changed since being on the generic brand, rather than the name brand Lamictal oral. Regardless, should my rash subside once off the med completely, I will need to have a replacement med which i dread the experimental stage of alternatives. Lamictal has been perfect for me. I hate the thought of experimenting with other drugs due to concerns of being drowsy, high or always groggy from any particular med. I had once been on Depakote, which was a total nightmare. I can't bear the play on my system during this trial/error process. If the rash continues, the dr. will be sending me to a specialist to have allergy testing done. Yey.....  "

211$Condition: Other$1/2/2013 1:35:36 PM$Reviewer: disappearingone, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$4$"I was prescibed lamictal aprrox. 6 months ago for PTSD/anxiety disorder (specifically, agoraphobia). My psychiatrist prescribed this for me because a decade+ of various SSRI's had either failed or provided minimal relief.

I started very slowly on this medication: 12.5 mg for 2 weeks, 25 mg for 2 weeks, and so on, doubling until I got to 100 mg and then adding 50 mg every we weeks until reaching 200 mg. The sub-100 mg doses caused minimal side effects (though no positive effects), but at 100 mgs, I began experiencing severe abdominal cramps, constipation for which I could get minimal relief via laxatives, probiotics, increased water and fiber intake, etc.

I informed my psychiatrist but he wanted me to continue taking Lamictal until I reached 200 mgs and maintained it for a month's time, his reasoning being that I would likely adjust to the side effects given enough time and that I would need to be on that dosage for at least 4 weeks to determine if it would yield any positive effects for my anxiety disorder. I reluctantly agreed and increased the dosage to 150 mgs, and the side effects increased considerably: the lower GI problems worsened, my blood pressure and core temperature dropped, I began experiencing intermittment numbness (particularly in my lower back), and I had very little energy. 

Dropping back to 100 mg has provided some relief, but the side effects are still significant and make it difficult to function normally on a regular basis. I intend to taper off of Lamictal entirely and go a different direction (the other mood stabilizing drugs my psychiatrist wants me to try next are likely to cause even more problems and will require regular blood testing).

I'm sure that this medication works well for many people, but I've noticed that many others--particularly those who aren't taking it for bipolar disorder--have experienced severe and sometimes debilitating side effects with little or no positive ones. I, too, fall into this category."
212$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$12/28/2012 1:18:30 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$5$"I started having Partial Complex seizures at 43, but had aura seizures a long time before that.  I started Lamictal at a low dose (maybe 25mg?)after the first Partial Complex seizure.  It has eventually increased to 500mg per day. I don't have a lot of seizures, a actually couldn't say how many I had/have because I went on medication right away.  

It seems to work for a while and then I will have one again after a few months.  Because mine are complex my license keeps getting taken away so every seizure was an increase in dose.  I also take Acetazolomide as my seizures tend to be catamenial.  

After being seizure free for 5 months, I had one a couple of days ago.  I am pretty sure my neurologist is going to refer me to an epileptologist at this point. If it is possible to be a ""lucky"" epileptic, I am.  My seizures are very harmless except for the suspension of my license.  

Just based on my patterns I almost think my body develops a tolerance for the medication, although I don't know if that is even possible."

It smoothed the peaks and the troughs and it made me much more tolerable to those around me. I did find it impaired my memory but at least I felt I could live with myself. 

I tried to come off this medication twice but troughed into a deep depression and so recontinued the med (titrating up slowly).  My reasons for coming off were that after about 3 years I did find the effectiveness to diminish. 

I'm now in a situation where there is less stress in my life and I've come off it again - no depression troughs and its been three months.

If I hadn't lined up a long period away from my work, and with reduced responsibilities, support from psych services and my doctor etc I never would have considered coming of this drug. 

In the future I may go back on. I was on 200mg so I'm guessing a more effective dose would be 300-400. Some people on this site have mentioned that they are on 600mg. As far as I know the maximum recommended dose as per my Psychiatrist is 400 - worth checking out!

I've read some comments here about people getting a skin rash when taking it and then waiting for it to go away. Don't do this. If a rash appears go straight back to your Dr as quick as you can. This was the one side effect that I feared from this med and titrating up slowly makes this reaction less probable."

My doctor thought it would be the best for me, he only has me taking 50mgs a night. It works somewhat, for mood swings and high and lows. But I also work out regularly and attend a local church. If I stay positive and stay around positive people it helps tremendously. DISLIKES of this drug are hair LOSS, memory LOSS. I take fish oil supplements to help with my memory. Lack of sleep is also a cause of my memory problems. Other then that, the drug seems to be working for the past two years I have been taking it.

I started small dose (25mg) and gradually went up to 200mg. I was on that dose for a year when I developed a rash. I had gone through Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome (SJS) while on Tegrotol 2 years before starting Lamictal so I knew what I was looking at. Went straight to ER and got treatment (was in ER just short of 24 hours). This case of rash only lasted 3-4 weeks. The first one was misdiagnosed and took 8-10 weeks of oral pred to clear up. I was lucky to avoid hospital but just barely. Skin sloughed including GI tract. Dry eyes is a warning sign-contact your doctor right away. I am no longer eligible for lasik surgery because of SJS. I lost 60# due to loss of appitite/taste buds.

Now, having said all the horrible things above, Lamictal was one of the best drugs I have ever been prescribed! While on maintenance dose I felt more ""balanced"" (I hate the word normal, don't you? What is normal anyway?) than I ever have. I know many people on this drug with no problems. I think this is a great drug worth giving a try. I would like to give this drug a try again but I'm diabetic and can't endanger my vision any more than I have."

38 yrs. the price I the US of out of pocket pay for Lamictal is astronomical like $700 a month for someone without insurance. It gives me a bit of the jitters which impairs medical practice somewhat and without other meds I have a number of side effects requiring a host of other meds to offset these. On the upside I have more energy, clear thinking, no more sleep apnea.

I do get unscheduled motivation, what I call ""A bug up my ..."" & I go until I can't, but they are far & few in between. I think I need an increase in my Lamictal.

I do, however, feel a bit 'weepy' at times, somewhat like PMS.  Not sure if that's depression or a side effect. I have noticed that my eyes are red, itchy and burning-- almost like conjunctivitis-- and I'm very dehydrated. The itchy eyes may be due to allergies (of which I have many) but it popped up as soon as  I started this medication.  I will most likely discontinue since I don't want to run the risk of messing with my vision and I am also quite concerned about 'The Rash' that appears to be not as rare as I thought. My coordination and memory is also a bit wonky and my appetite has increased.   

I gained a TREMENDOUS amount of weight (in addition to other unbearable side effects, like drooling, nervous movements, non-existent cognitive abilities) whilst on other psychotropic drugs 18 years ago, which led to my discontinuing all medications until recently after my symptoms became more troublesome.  

I am therefore quite wary of psychiatrists and psychiatric drugs."

During the 3rd week of titrating the dosage upwards (while I was out of town on a business trip), my body began to literally burn from head to toe.  My entire body became swollen and I was in a lot of pain. A co-worker took me to a local ER (against my wishes, but it turns out, she actually saved my life)they could not diagnose the condition, so I immediately got on a flight back to Ft. Lauderdale, where eventually in the Cleveland Clinic ER, they diagnosed my condition as Stevens Johnson Syndrome. I have never had any allergic reactions to medications in the past and at the time the ER doctors were not familiar with how to treat the condition.  The burning continued for days, while I was in the hospital and it took many weeks for my skin to heal and for me to be able to go back to work, be in the sun, etc. I felt like I had burns similiar to those I would sustain if my body was set on fire.  While I know this side effect is rare for this medication and based on the posts I see on this page, it does appear to help some patients.  Just please, please, please, if you notice a rash a burning feeling beginning to develop seek medication attention quickly.  My condition had worsened by the time I got back to Ft. Lauderdale and was life threatening.  My doctor did not explain this potential side effect of this medication, so it took a lot longer to diagnose.

I've been taking 200 mgs a day for a few years now. There are very little side effects. I just feel drowsy after I take it so I might switch to taking it at night instead of the morning. I've occasionally had some little bumps that appear on my hands but I think it's when I've missed my meds or I'm stressed and scratch at myself. 

I never developed an actual rash as a side effect but I've noticed that it makes your skin sensitive to develop a rash but nothing dangerous. Like when I have broken out with a couple bumps and I get anxious --- if I keep scratching then it will turn into a rash and look swollen (different than if you were off the meds and would scratch yourself). But my skin isn't sensitive to heat or touch. I hope that makes sense the way I'm trying to explain it.

No memory problems. No weight gain. No sex drive issues.

I still have depression but nothing like when I'm off the meds. I've thought about increasing it but I'm not sure if I would have memory problems? or if it would kill my creative drive. Being an artist, I don't want to get rid of my manic states completely and be ""flat"" all the time. 

Prozac and wellbutrin caused memory problems and made me feel ""flat"" and I didn't want to work or create anything. I also gained 70 lbs and had no sex drive. Wrong meds for me.

I recommend Lamictal. As with most meds, when you are first taking it and increasing your dosage, you will experience some anxiety, shakes, etc. but it goes away within a couple weeks."

The doctors added Lamictal and Seroquel. The Seroquel was horrid! Had an unsatiable appetite and gained over 30 pounds in a short time. We discontinued the Seroquel, and now just on the Lamictal. The appetite is back to normal but still struggling to lose wieght. I feel more stable now than I have in years. I don't know if the Lamictal is an adherent to my weight loss efforts. Sometimes I get an eerie/dizzy type feeling but it passes quickly. My memory seems to have dulled somewhat and I can't always find the right word I am looking for, but other than that, I think this drugs benefits have outweighed the perceived side effects. I sleep better and can get up in the mornings now so much easier. I wish someone knew the long term effects of this drug. I hate taking meds, but I guess this one is a winner cause I don't feel like running or committing suicide any more. My family is sure happier with me.

My doctor put me on Lamictal, and it's much easier to control. They figure I have bipolar II. When I first began the medication, I would type entire wrong words. It was kind of strange, but only lasted a month. Maybe a little clutziness too. The only complaint was that it made it where I couldn't get very deep sleep. It's like the lights were on 24/7. After a year, my doctor lowered my dosage of Lamictal and put me on something to help me sleep. It's been good ever since.

I use Lamotrigine (the generic). I have a lot of memory loss. My short term memory is shot. I am in college and it is extreamly tough for me to learn the material. Good notes are required. Its harder for me to concentrate with this drug. I cannot follow two conversations at once. I take 150mg twice a day. The nightly dosage is the toughest. If i take this pill when completely relaxed it seems to make more tired. My friends tell me i say some weird things that i do not remember saying. is does make me drowsy so i need to keep my body moving. If i miss a few dosages i will have a seizure, and i forget the entire previous day(s). i also lose memories. It has thinned out my blood as well. I get headaches often, somtimes migraines. This drug has its side effects, but i would much rather have these side effects than to have seizures all the time. My doctor also tells me that its the safest anti-epilepsy drug on the market so far. This drug has saved, and ruined my life at the same time with its different effects.
294$Condition: Other$1/4/2012 10:27:38 PM$Reviewer: Lane5, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$4$"About 3.5 years ago, my doctor put me on Lamictal as a mood stabilizer — I have PTSD (panic attacks / depression). I am not bipolar or manic-depressive. It was helpful at the 100-level dosages, but when the dosage went up to 150-200mg, I soon began losing control of my legs muscles and literally crumble to the floor. It would happen out of the blue, little warning. Very scary.  At the time, I did not associate this condition with the drug — I thought I was getting full-blown MS. I was getting quite scared at that point.  My insurance company told me they would no longer pay for the brand name, so I had to go to the generic which only accelerated the problems. Last month, my legs “gave way” on a busy street, and I fell hard on the pavement, cracking open my head. I bled profusely, had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance, the whole nine yards. Six staples in my head.  $5,600 in medical bills. The very morning of the fall, I began thinking the drug was the cause of my leg problem — the “weak leg syndrome” had begun within 20 minutes of my taking it that very morning. Over the following days while recovering from the fall, I began tapering with my doctor’s blessings, and within a few days all the muscle weakness left. I was amazed that my hair (which had been thinning during the time I began the drug), turned into a wiry, dry mess (it’s normally straight and shiny) but in less than a month has already begun thickening (I’m using extremely moisturizing shampoos and conditioners at the moment). Continual dull headaches went away — didn’t realize how bad I had felt.  Goodbye Lamictal and good riddance. I am managing okay, but as a PTSD precaution, my doc has put me on 100 mg nightly of Equetro (a cousin, of sorts, to Lamictal, as I was told). I’m holding my breath to see how that goes. After nearly a year of mystery symptoms, and panicking (ironic, huh?) I’d almost rather go without ANYTHING than risk another Lamictal-like situation. I hope this helps someone…."
295$Condition: Other$12/8/2011 10:52:27 PM$Reviewer: kimballla, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$I've been taking lamictal for @ 5 wks for PTSD (off-label use for the drug). I started @ 25mg, & within the first 3 days, I could tell a difference for the better in my PTSD symptoms. I also began to itch really bad all over my body, mostly at night. I went up to 50mg after 2 weeks, and the first day after increasing the medication, a very itchy rash began on one side of my stomach. It was red, felt like little goose bumps, and I would itch more after showering. I itched like crazy all over my body, especially the back of my legs, but the rash was only on my stomach. After another week, the rash spread to the other side of my stomach, and my psychiatrist advised me to see a dermatologist. I will say that my PTSD symptoms were much better. I began getting sleepy at a (more) normal hour at night, was actually sleeping without add'l sleep medication, having less nightmares and anxiety,feeling more positive, having less crying & shaking spells, and just an overall more even mood. The dermatologist said the rash looked more like eczema than anything, & prescribed a topical lotion to put on the rash, & a benadryl-like med to take @ night. He took a biopsy just to make sure the rash wasn't a drug allergy. The rash began to disappear within 2 days, & I wasn't itching so much at night. Biopsy came back that it was a drug allergy, & my dermatologist & pdoc told me to go off of it. So disappointing, considering it's the drug that has worked best for me! Now, I've just been prescribed a low dose of Latuda to take @ night. My derm. told me that although he didn't think it was THE deadly lamictal rash, that the rash could get worse with continued exposure to the med. I for sure don't want to be on anything that I've been confirmed as being allergic to. I was told to come off the lamictal, and that I didn't need to taper off at such a low dose. It's my first day without it, and I've already felt more anxious! Figures I'm allergic to the 1 med that worked so well for me!

There is monitored proof of this, was taking Lamictal when I entered an epilepsy monitoring unit, was weaned from the drug and the EEG activity was no different.  This drug did not stop nor lessen seizures, even though the dosage was increased constantly, and proper levels of Lamictal were measured in the blood.  Only took this med for ten months, unfortunately during junior year of high school, so grades were poor that year.  Had been switched to Lamictal from Topamax (Topamax had worked well for 3.5 years, but quit working.  While in the EMU, Lamictal was discontinued and Keppra was started.

It doesn't make me lethargic or out of it, I haven't gained a lot of weight and my moods have leveled out. Still have situational episodes of mania/depression but my meds definitely keep my on an even keel. The only side effect of this medication that really bothers me is the constant dry mouth/bad taste in mouth. Also, do not abruptly stop taking this medication. I have done this several times (you know us bipolor people and taking our meds!) and it causes dizziness, vomitting, internal ""electric zaps"" and basic overall withdrawal symptoms.

I was on effexor from age 13 to 16 but for some reason it stopped working and I stated getting really bad depression again. I wouldn't say I'm very manic - I mostly have the lows, not so much the highs. I've been stable for about 5 or 6 years now with no problems and I make sure to stay that way but limiting my alcohol intake and pretty much eliminating any recreational drug use. I find that I am always much better off with my meds if I'm consistantly sober. I also exercise a lot and get enough sleep. One side effect I have is my libido is pretty much nonexistant, but I've been on these meds since before I was sexually active so I cannot say for sure that the meds are what causes that. This is the reason I am on here though - to see if anyone else has this problem. Overall I really appreciate everything Lamictal has done for me. 
Additionally, I also take the generic version and have no found any differences in it's effects. "

Yes, new patients start low and work up...for me, I boosted it by about 50mg weekly until I got to 350mg, which is where I am currently at but my psychiatrist may boost it a little more. 

I am satisfied with the somewhat stealthy nature of this medication's effects, as this means that the side effects don't feel there at all. I took quite a few mood stablizers in the past and noticed unpleasant side effects; mainly related to energy and mental numbness. 

I feel like I need to be on this a little longer to really gain more wisdom about it (it's been around 5 months for me now), but so far I have had no reason to want to go off of it, and I am no stranger to mood stabilizers..."

So I return to my original psychitrist for other reasons. ( the new psychiatrist was going to put me on ENSAM patch while taking cymbalta..= seratonin syndrone..Original psychiatrist knew about that too. ALSO she told me that taking Depakote and Lamictal = TOXIC..I am on 500mg Depakote bedtime, 125mg Depakote am. SO for now she is weaning me off the lamictal..Originall Shrink had me on ZOLOFT. It worked + .50mg Ativan..1mg Klonipin..I was fine, stable, able to handle things in calm manner, shower, drive, etc..I had not a wisper of anxiety since 2007 to March 2010. Shrink bullied me into takng Prozac..I can' take Proazac- get adverse reaction--head goes spinning out of control at 15mg. SHRINK said lower it to 10mg and BAM hit with dreadful ANXIETY. Then Zoloft gave me ANXIETY after swithced.THen another new shrink - puts me on 5-6mg Ativan/day. DX: Severe anxiety. Finally went back to origina shrink and was put on CYMBALTA..It finally greatly reduced anxiety,stil had to take about 3mg throught out day..So I have been screwed up since May 2010. Not stable at all. I REFUSED the Prozac BUT before I coud get out the most imp. info. SHRINK ambused me, Prozac,etc,etc ..I never got to tell her I took it before and I pill made my head go crazy..due to the immediate ambush. SO I have been in hell for 1year,3months. I don't trust SHRINKS anymore. I don't know what is to become of me. For those of you who have had sucess on Lamictal, I'm happy for you..Very worrid (understatement) about me. YOu don't  know what it is like to feel normal & functioal on a medication, then have your shrink bully you into med (Prozac) that has caused me to have prmanent anxiety BEAUSE shrink ambushed me before I could say: I got adverse reaction from Prozac before.

I recently began lamictal in treatment of bipolar disorder. I had been on SSRI antidepressants since around the age of 20. I thought they were working, but yet, I was still extremely depressed, anxious, and unpredictable in my behaviors. I cried all the time, became angry frequently, and felt out of control emotionally. I struggled to keep a job for longer than a year, stay in my marriage, stay focused on any one thing, or have any semblance of a balanced, healthy life. I was only ever offered SSRIs and I thought my life experience was the best it was ever going to be. I was addicted to cigarettes, alcohol, and food. 

I didn't realize how bad I actually was, until I started using the lamictal product in January of this year. Suddenly, who I was completely changed. This is my best self - the person I never imagined that I could be. 

My whole life has changed in ways I never thought possible. I don't feel so overwhelmed and tortured with guilt or depression. I am successful at work, I purchased my own home, I lost 50 lbs, and I am stable in many, many ways I never thought possible. I do attribute this to lamictal, because of the immediate and significant changes that I have experienced. The simple addition of this medication in my life has made these things possible. 

If I had known the person I could be under these conditions, things in my life would have been very different for years. I do not regret the past, as it is in the past, but I do look forward to my future so very very much more than I ever have.

I have been able to start my life over in a more productive and healthy manner. I cannot say enough about this drug - it has saved my life.

I have bipolar disorder, ADHD,generalized anxiety, agoraphobia and substance abuse problems.  Because of my addictive personality, I can't take stimulants for ADHD or Xanax for anxiety, sleep meds or Seroquel.  I'm currently sober.  I was on lithium for ten years, but replaced it a month ago for lamyctal.  I'm also take Wellbutrin, buspar, inderal and thyroid meds. I'm on disability for mental illness after losing my job due to stress and my husband's cancer, which made my symptons worse than they've been for a while, especially the anxiety and emotional instability.  I use benadryl and herbals to help me sleep.  The lamyctal causes more trouble sleeping than lithium.  I'm on 200 millegrams so far of generic lamyctal and for the first time in years I don't feel ""dumbed down"".  I've lost a little weight, am running and dancing again, cleaning my house (big change) and am more organized, confident and cheerful.  I'm hoping it's not hypomania, but I feel happier.  I have hopes for this med, though my time on it has been short.

Few psychotropic were available in the mid-1980s. As that began to change, I found relief with products like Prozac & Zoloff, but would grow ""tolerant"" within 2 years, losing the benefit of their earlier promise.
I have been on lamictal for just uver 1 year, starting at lower rates and now at 300 mg/day.

That being said, I love Lamictal.It's like a gift from God.My anger and anxiety were quelled and I felt much more confident. I'm so disappointed that I had to titrate down to 200 mg.It takes some of the edge off, but I can tell the difference.I have very few of the above-mentioned side effects, now, though.
I will be talking to my prescriber to determine if she has an idea of something I could take along with Lamictal to mimic the same effects.Maybe I'll just have to go back up to the 400 mg dose and deal with the side effects. I suppose it's a trade off, either way."

I have been on Lamictal for about 7 years. I've had very a few side effects which includes, fatigue, dizziness at times, blurry vision at times.  They all come and go.  I've gotten used to them and just relax when they appear.  I've never heard about bad skin rashes or have had any severe issues.  Lamictal has been great for me.  I've been having seizures for 20 years now and I've been on quite a few medications and I can say that my side effects are minimal and I'm most grateful. I believe the noted side effects may have been from me just not taking proper care of myself.  Eating right, taking vitamins, getting enough rest at night and a little bit of physical activity. I would suggest trying to do everything right before deciding that any medication isn't working as it should.  So many times I thought I had a headaches because of the medication when it was actually, from forgetting to take the medicine or not eating.  

If you can, write down the changes you feel before starting and after you start and review it with your doctor.  

Good Luck everyone and I hope this helps. "

First off, the medicine was difficult to take because if you missed a dose you had to wait another 24 hours.  Also I was paranoid about a possible rash developing because it was mentioned in the side effects.  Also it did not help with the mania, actually made it worse.  After 3 days, I was rushed to the hospital because I could not sleep and was delusional.  I would not recommend this drug.

Finally, I did my own research and went and saw a mental health doctor that was able to diagnose Bi-polar disorder extremely fast.  Lamictal was the first and only drug I have ever tried for bi-polar and it makes such a difference that I was shocked.  I can't beleive how many years I went thinking my moods were normal.  No more mania where my thoughts race and no more crying either.  I noticed 12 hours or so after taking the pill it must wear off or something becaue my thoughts become fuzzy again.  I now take the pill first thing upon rising and it works fine.  No other side effects really, but if I forget to take the pill for even one day, I do feel a difference.  If you are truly bipolar then give it a shot.  My doctor informs me it's one of the best drugs for bipolar patients as it has very few side effects.  I have been on the drug for a couple years and can't beleive how much better things are.

The rashes did not respond to any over-the-counter or prescription creams. I stopped the medicine on the 6th day and later went on steroids to get rid of the rash.

It was prescribed to me when I became very suicidal during a low in the cycle of the bipolar. Lamictal saved my life and I would recommend it to anyone. It has kept me level for the time that I have been on it. I have had a few side effects. I am currently trying to taper off to see how I will do on a very low dose from 400mg hopefully to 150mg. I am very athletic and the med has significantly limited my stamina. Hopefully I won't relapse too badly. I will say that I owe my  life to lamictal so if you need a good med and have not tried lamictal, definitely ask your physician about it. Good luck!

For years I kept telling my psychiatrist that it ""just comes out of the blue,"" but he never accepted that as a reason.

I tried about twenty different antidepressants, including prozac, zoloft, neurontin, imipramine, wellbutrin (left a permanent ringing in my ears), effexor (can't have an orgasm), and others.  None helped at all.

Lamictal:  After the initial Starter Pack, I take 200 mgs.  

Side effects:  None. 
Problems: None. 
Effectiveness: Great! 
Rapidity:  It was helpful within six weeks.
Continuing effect: It still works, after about 3 years.

I take the brand name, not the generic. The generic did not work. (Lamictal has a co-pay discount card. Ask for it!) 

I feel like myself. People without depression don't know what that means. Good for them. But finally I feel like myself.

Depression and depressive episodes:  Yes, they come back from time to time. But the dips are lower, and the duration is shorter. 

Lamictal has been a life saver for me!

Initially put on Dylantin, then switched to Depakote. Over the years had levels adjusted as is to be expected. Recently Depakote was losing effectiveness so the doc decided to try Lamictal. Bad idea. Knocked my Dep level WAY down. Caused me to have two seizures in one morning(a scenario that has only occured one other time in my life). We're trying Keppra now, and so far so good! Keeping my fingers crossed. I think sometimes we put a little too much on our doctors. You have to keep in mind they're doing the best they can. Different meds effect EVERYBODY differently. You have to try different stuff till you find something that works. Also, there are certain side effects that are inherent to seizure control meds. Hair loss, weight gain, mood swings, etc. Doesn't always occur, but it can. So if you're new to the game, these are just a few things you can expect. And to those of you out there that wanna put all that guilt and such on your dr.s- if you're that unhappy with 'em, find another doc! If you don't think they're doin the job, move on! You wouldn't stay with a boyfriend or girlfriend if he/she was makin you miserable! Would you?! Just sayin. The human body constantly changes throughout its lifecycle. There is soooo much we have yet to understand about it! I know it's tough, but we have to be a bit patient! I hope my ramblings help somebody out there. My prayers go out to those families that suffer out there! Be strong, have faith, we'll make it through!

I did as the doctor prescribed and I started to experience really bad side effects. First my entire inner thighs had hives and itched like crazy. However that wasn't the worst part. For a full week when I went up to 75mg, I would wake up at 5am with my back hurting and felt like I was going to have a heart attack. It got to the point that I was in so much pain that I could barely get out of bed. This wouldn't go away until 12pm when the pill wore off. At that moment, I decided to get off the meds at once. Sure it helped maintain a better affect, but I almost died from the horrible side effects!

I have decluttered my whole house effortlessly, organized things that I never seemed to be able to do.I did try I managed to get all A's in a sw master's program 20 years ago i wanted to help others and understand myself.It was exhausting. Infact everything I ever achieved was never as far as I dreamed and took a lot out of me to function.Now I hope this lasts because Everyday that goes by and i am able to keep going forward with organizing dealing with life calmly and most importantly enjoy spending time with my son.  I would be out of it and have to go to bed or so caught up in something that i was there but not really.I am able to move forward with friends, events, tasks and routines. I believe drinking smoking not get enough sleep, hormonally unbalanced (I was) stress and not having a healthy life style w food and exercise,lower the chances of having great success with any drug. after 2 months on this drug, i had a glass of wine I haven't had any alcohol in months I had a migraine body aches foggy brain.  I got over it . Some people say that coffee alcohol cashews and chocolate need to be cut out.The chocolate gets in once in a while, coffee too but i mostly drink decaf,  I am going forward and not looking back at what I created because of promises broken no shows, paranoia and just not functioning  so many dreams crushed friends lost. I value my mental functioning more than anything and love this new found freedom and ease in my ability to be in the world  I have just performed my music.  Passionate lyrics and music i have written over the years i can do it now. I hope to keep new friends and hopefully my family will gain respect and understanding when they see me functioning consistently at such a higher level.I wish all of you the same.Would like to know your stories. May I always feel this way.

It's been a miracle for the bipolar issues: at 50 milligrams of Lamictal I went from a volatile, frequently suicidal mess to someone who could function better than most.  However, Lamictal has not done much, if anything, for my epilepsy, even though I'm up to a therapeutic dose.  Other than the ineffectiveness against seizures, the only thing I don't like about Lamictal is that it's a disgustingly bitter pill without any coating.

423$Condition: Other$12/9/2010 12:15:20 PM$Reviewer: dani02, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I was started on this medication, because I was having severe mood swings. I started out slowly (50mg) with a goal to get to 400mg. Well, everytime I increased my side effects would get worse and worse: nausea, headache, anxiety, crying spells, etc (most only lasted 4-5 days, so I just stuck through it). When I got to 250mg I missed my period, was getting stomach cramping, trouble urinating, and started vomiting, the side effects were unbearable, I couldnt function at all, and the crying spells were everyday multiple times a day (never went away). So I told my doctor Ive had enough & I wanted to be taken off of it. He agreed & every 4 days I dropped 50mg, the withdrawals were hard, severe panic attacks & nausea, but I was just happy to be getting off this med. After my last pill it took 5-10 days to completely leave my system, & I couldnt be happier. I am doing much better without this medication. I have slight mood swings but Im just going to deal with it. My severe mood swings might have been caused by my anxiety, living situation, working, or maybe from another med. I refuse to go on any more mood stabilizers, because most require blood tests. Overall, Im doing much better without it, and Im so glad that Im off of it, just wasnt worth it--and apparently I didnt need it anyhow. Im not Bi-Polar or anything, just have a panic disorder. I don’t like being on medication-to much fuss.

I tend to find, from myself and others, that these psychological drugs just change the problem. Instead of being depressed you have headaches, blurred vision and mental confusion. Now this is not to say that the switch is bad, it's often better, but it's certainly not optimal. Once you accept this you might feel better about your situation. I have found that the headaches and lack of mental clarity are the worst for me. I'm a grad student so this is certainly not the best fit for me. But as I said earlier, it's better than being depressed and not having the desire to use my mental functions at all. I think that this drugs work best when you are under the careful watch of a doctor who really take the time to have a close relationship with you. Any kind of medication like this could be a short-term solution, a few years maybe. It's a means to an end. The end in this case is dealing with depression, mood swings and anxiety. To many doctors seem to think the medication is the end solution. I really look forward to the day I no longer have to take lamictal or any alternative. As long as you have that goal in mind, you express that clearly to your doctor and he's willing to help you reach that goal, the drug can help in the meantime.

I tend to find, from myself and others, that these psychological drugs just change the problem.  Instead of being depressed you have headaches, blurred vision and mental confusion.  Now this is not to say that the switch is bad, it's often better, but it's certainly not optimal.  Once you accept this you might feel better about your situation.

I have found that the headaches and lack of mental clarity are the worst for me.  I'm a grad student so this is certainly not the best fit for me.  But as I said earlier, it's better than being depressed and not having the desire to use my mental functions at all.  

I think that this drugs work best when you are under the careful watch of a doctor who really take the time to have a close relationship with you.  Any kind of medication like this could be a short-term solution, a few years maybe.  It's a means to an end.  The end in this case is dealing with depression, mood swings and anxiety.  To many doctors seem to think the medication is the end solution.  I really look forward to the day I no longer have to take lamictal or any alternative.  As long as you have that goal in mind, you express that clearly to your doctor and he's willing to help you reach that goal, the drug can help in the meantime.  You just have to willing to accept the side effects, which as I said, while no fun in their own right, are often preferable to the alternative.   "

It took quite some time for me to have enough in my system but after I did, I began to fall down unexpectedly.  I was hurt twice.  I made a suicidal attempt that left terrible scars.  Finally, my thyroid enlarged to the point I looked like a man.  NONE of my doctors could say why but after a sonogram and trips to the GP,OB GYN and then ENT, I had a refill come due and reread the info.  Lo and behold my symptoms stared out at me.  All stopped after getting off Lamictal.  One year later, though I have hypothyroidism and can't help but wonder (with no other risk factors) if this drug didn't ultimately cause  this condition, too.

Lamictal was a godsend and I am on 350 mg.  I have only been off it for the first 2 trimesters of my pregnancy and got back on the last trimester.  I nursed on it and my son is fine (very intelligent).  I am not always happy (I am also on a low does of celexa) but I am a lot more balanced and only really offkilter before my period.  My one problem with Lamictal is that it has really messed up my memory.  I am 37 and feel like I have dementia sometimes.  It can be embarrasing when you are having a conversation with someone and you can't even recall the details of what you talked about with them about just a few days before.  But my psychiatrist says that if you get off it, the memories come back and I feel it is worth the loss of memory to feel basically normal.  My husband also finds me much more pleasant since I have been on it!

The depression is going away slowly, I still have ups and downs. I am noticing a slight change in my weight but that's for the better. I also have noticed a small rash but just saw it right before I looked it up on here and plan to call my doctor tomorrow about it. (Sadly for me, all the meds that work are ones that make me super sick. Wish it was different!) I was on lithium off and on until recently when they finally changed my meds after 8 years. I was up to 1200mgs a day of lithium and they were going to change it again and up the dosage. That's where I run into problems with my thyroid and kidneys so I opted for a new med. This one has a chance of weight loss and I'm already too heavy so I picked this one. 

Hopefully the rash isn't anything major, I WAS just pregnant, miscarried. Could just be hormones yet. "

I'm afraid to try anything else as I am in a comfort zone with this med, except for the recent side effects. --A final note: I was also using Abilify as an anti-psychotic but after six months developed tardive dyskinesia, where my tongue began squirming and writhing like it had snakes in it! very bizarre!

THE NAME BRAND, the generic is a different drug all together and dangerous.I developed depression when I was 35 due to a situation beyond my control.I was always a happy person.It got bad.After a few years,I tried antidepressants,made me angry.I went to a psychologist for talk therapy.She said that possibly I was bipolar.I was a workaholic.She recognized it as a mild manic episode,combined with the depression.She suggested I also go see a psychiatrist she knew.I went and the DR. suggested I try a new drug on the market. She was very familiar with it.She had done long studies in her internship for her Doctorate for FDA approval and it was a very promising drug for bipolar.She said she had done other studies and this drug was very successful in controlling bipolar depression.She even said it was the first drug to make such an impact on Bipolar.I was informed of the side effects, especially the rash.I researched it then went back to try it.I made an appointment in 1 month and was told to call at anytime I didn't feel quite right,any side effects,no matter how small.I was told how to slowly work up to a clinical dose 25 mg at a time, increasing weekly.I went back after 3 weeks, the terrible depression and hopelessness went away slowly IN 3 WEEKS! It brought the depression down to a manageable level,changed my life for the better.She even was surprised how fast it worked for me.I don't like meds so I slowly worked up to 175mg.My DR said a clinical dose was at least 200 and usually more. I kept that same dose for a few years until finally I increased it slowly, when I felt the depression coming on. I now take 300mg in the morning after 8years.I've had no side effects unless I forget,shakiness,it reminds me to take it. It scares me to think if I ever can't get it,I'm in trouble.I had severe reactions when I tried 3 generics,double vision,loss of ALL motor control,unable to move a muscle 7 hours 911.The generic is very dangerous.

For many years, my M.D.treated my psychiatric condition with older proven medications, that did/do not have dozens of  potentially deadly side effects, and for the most part, everything went well. I had an episode here and there, but nothing like what I have without meds. Unfortunately, my doctor, and great friend of 25 years, passed away. Of course, the new M.D. who replaced her, felt a psych. might be more qualified. As with all doctors, he had nothing to say but terrible things about the meds I was on, and put me on this shit. At first, it seemed to help, but in the last 6 months, I have had nothing but problems with this so-called  medication. Blurred vision, loss of words, fainting spells, and now, after 19 days I have been released from the hospital after a near fatal case of meningitis. If you like living, please, for you, your family, and anyone who cares about you, THROUGH THE SHIT IN THE TRASH, AND FIND A NEW DOCTOR!!!

I didn't feel ANYTHING at all until I got up to 150mg. It was then that I started feeling the fatigue, strange muscle aches and backpain, lack of interest, lack of the ability to concentrate, strange trembles. My doctor initially suggested I take the medication in the morning because it can cause Insomnia. After two weeks on 150 mg I was instructed to go up to 200 mg. The fatigue became so severe that I would literally count down the hours and minutes until I could leave work, come home and just go to bed. I couldn't handle this so recently I decided to take it in the middle of the afternoon and it has done WONDERS for me. While I'm still getting the benefits of this medication, I don't have to deal with the fatigue or other side effects during the day.

Firstly because I'm a bit medication-phobic and secondly because I had a bad time with both Depakote and Gabapentin. However, I needn't have worried because Lamictal was so much easier for me to tolerate. I had no bad side effects with it at all, very slight sleepiness for the first couple of days and each time I upped the dose, but other than that nothing. Despite the annoying amount of time it takes to titrate to a helpful dose, it is definitely worth doing it sensibly to lower the chances of the dreaded rash. I started on 25mg a day and week by week increased by 25mg until I reached the 200mg a day that I take now. I have found 200 to be effective for me and am sticking with that for the time being. I know there is still further room to increase if I need it. I have only been on Lamictal since January, so 8 months now, but in that time my moods have been much more stable. I still have slight lows and slight highs but instead of my moods flying uncontrollably between -10 to +10 now it's more like -4 to +4 - I never quite seem to get any higher than slight hypomania nor any lower than slight depressions. For me this drug has helped massively.

I have had no problems for about 3 years but was somewhat depressed lately so doctor uped the dose.  I came to see if a higher does might be a problem.  Hard to tell as there are lots that its working and some that it is not.  I am used to all of this as I have been on meds for 20 years now.  My only problem with all of these meds is that I have gained weight and am having a hard time losing weight.  I don't really blame it on the meds though.  As long as I am feeling well emotionally I will deal with the weight.

He has been bipolar for the 33 years I have known him.  The doctor seems to think that the bipolar disorder is a bigger problem than the alzheimer's.  He is an alcoholic as well.  He has had to grown sons commit suicide.  Four other grown children , I suspect have some type of disorder as well.  Their mother is an alcoholic.  I am thankful that he and I never had children together.  He lives in an independent living facility for the past three years as my traveling job prevents me from taking care of him, he cannot be left alone.  They are having complaints about him now.  He steals small things when they take him shopping.  His comments always border on sexual and his behavior in general is very inappropriate, even in front of total strangers.  I don't know what I will do with him next.  I feel they are getting weary of him there.  I have no help financially or otherwise from his remaining 4 grown children.  He is taking Lamotrigine, Aricept and Fluoxitine for his depression.  Please, any suggestions would be appreciated.  I am at a financial loss and am having such a hard time emotionally with this as well. He is 77 years of age.

The first thing the new one did was put me on Lamictal, without even asking about how I was doing on my other meds. I had been in remission for 8 years. Since then, I've gone into a horrible episode, the worst I've ever had. First, I was so manic that I ran up bills of over $30K, on my spouse's credit card without his knowledge, then taking out several loans in my own name and spending it all. I don't have anything to show for all this money, I don't even know what I spent most of it on, except for little junky stuff like movie memorabilia, stuff off eBay, groceries, stuff at WalMart, clothes and shoes that didn't fit and I ended up giving to Goodwill. Then I slipped into a deep depression. I sit at the kitchen table in front of my laptop for 22-24 hours a day, reading my thousands of junk emails and links in them. I sleep only about 2 hours a night, on the couch. I haven't been in my bedroom for several months, take a shower maybe twice a month when My husband forces me to, barely eat anything and have lost 50+ pounds (I'm now under 100 pounds and still losing). And the pdoc will not entertain the thought that maybe my meds need adjusting. I've brought it up 3 times, and he says things like ""there's no pill that's going to make your problems go away,"" ""it's not the Lamictal,"" and stuff like that. It's like he doesn't want to admit that maybe he was wrong? I've been looking for another doc, but no luck; I live in such a small town and there's only one who works with bipolars. The reviews on him are horrible, he sounds worse than the one I have, I don't know what to do. But I do know that the Lamictal did NOTHING at all for me. "

It has worked wonders for my major depressive disorder and my panic attacks. Although I have Clonazapem for the bad panic attacks, I don't use it as much, so that's good. My doctors nurse has been trying to shove a bipolar diagnosis on me for the past 3-4 years. I keep asking when the manic happiness will happen since I really want to be normally happy. I know that life situations don't help matters any, but at least this helps me to keep going and get out of bed. So if you have depression that won't go away with other meds, don't be afraid to give this a roll. I was apprehensive at first, but now I know the doc was right. Oh, and it's a great to help with migraines! Woohoo!

Overall, I agree with what a few others had said that at the higher dosage I feel more hostile, agitated and impatient, so I definitely recall at the lower dosages being less angry and hostile, so either I will try again at the lower dosage or I will need to come off this medication altogether cause I will not continue to itch like this all day every day.

It put me very near death and I am extremely lucky to be alive (according to the Dr.). I took Lamictal for a month at the age of 21 and it actually was great for my bipolar symptoms.  I had tried so many medications that did not work and Lamictal finally helped.  However, at the end of that first month I rode an ambulance and helicopter to 3 different hospitals and ended up in a burn center.  I suffered burns for head to toe; inside and out.  The palms of my hands and the soles of my feet actually peeled off in whole. The result actually changed my eyesight (I found out later that people actually have gone blind).It was devastating for me, my family, and my friends.  8 years later I still suffer from effects as well as have scars all over my body. I would risk Stevens-Johnson syndrome (my experience caused by the use of Lamictal)for anything.

At the time I was single, had my own apartment, working full time.this medicine turned me into a vegetable, I had to move back in with my mother and quit my job to recover. As far as the seizures go, it pretty much eliminated them but I had no quality of life at all. Quitting this medicine was one of the best choices I could have made.

For the past  4  months,  however,  my short-term memory has significantly decreased to the point where it is negatively affecting daily functioning.

Using this medication has been overall positive, but if I had known about the profound distraction of the ringing, I would have continued my search for another drug.

I think my seizure could have been avoided if my doctor had sent me often for blood work, and then we would have known that my levels were dropping? before that seizure he was only having me go ONCE a year for blood work. NOW, I take it upon myself and get checked. Otherwise, I have no problems, the only thing I notice is that I have a lack of coordination, which is a side effect, and have no other problems.

I was diagnosed bipolar in 1991 with possible ad/hd, which was confirmed by a long test administered by an expert in the field. From 2001 on, having lost insurance with a divorce, I was forced to seek treatment at the VA! Not good!!! Having been treated by 6 doctors there, the only were treating the depression aspect of my disorder. I was unaware of this as most of these doctors were impatient and few could speak adequate English. Finally, I was declared disabled by SS and received my Medicare card July 1 of 09. I purchased an Advantage Plan from a private health insurance company to allow me great access to health care. $ months ago, I had my first session with a highly recommended private psychiatrist. I presented my medications for review. In less than 3 minutes, he declared: ""You're not on any mood stabilizer."" Imagine my surprise and displeasure. All those years, the flip-flopping of moods, all the different combination of medications, all the family, spousal dysfunction, with divorces and separations, all the hope that the next mediation would do it and last! The new doctor prescribed this drug. Literally, within a week, and only on the trial pack, I was a new man! I hadn't felt this good in years. Everything changed. I'm also taking Cymbalta for depression but at much lower dose. Gradually, he increased my dose of Lamictal,to 200mg. And though, my current wife is living somewhere in Indiana, and there since right after her accompanying me to the new doctor, I'm naturally feeling depression as there no contact with her and I love and care for her deeply and I believe she me, I'm managing to take care of things I could not manage before. I'm opening mail, paying bills, taking showers, doing some writing, more of less living a more 'normal' life. This medication has turned my life around! I pray that these results continue. I can't praise this drug more highly. After 4-5 months, still doing fine, in spite of living alone and missing my wife. A new me!!!!"

After tweaking the amounts Lamictal has worked wonders for me! I used to have secondary generalized, complex partials and simple partials on a monthly basis at one point. To me that was way to much but that's no longer the case for me. Besides the simple partials I get here and there during my menstral cycle the med is doing great. I have acne and gained weight but my condition is under control. Over the years I've taken 4 meds at all different dosages but the 200 mgs of lamictal and 300 mgs 2x's a day work for me. I believe med is an adjunctive med and thats why the trileptal works for me too. I tried going off of trileptal and stay just on lamictal and that didn't work and the same can be said for the lamictal without trileptal. My point is that the med is supposed to be taken with another one. It took me years but I found a way to control this condition. Dilantin, topomax, trileptal, lamictal and klonopin were alone, 2 @ a time or 3 @ a time at all doses but it was lamictal with trileptal. Talk to your dr. if you must or CHANGE drs. To a dr who can find the write combo for you. Well I love the med and am sooo happy I was put on it!

Have not taken drugs since (5 yrs) and have been fine and successful, looking to get into med school.  Worse (and common) side effect: cognitive/memory impairment- to the point of very frequently having my mind go blank during conversations or contemplating things, also my short term memory was shot. I do not see how one could take this drug and ""function"" (really live).  Be wary of this diagnosis in the first place- demand that any organic medical cause (especially thyroid disease as it features psychiatric symptoms) be found and treated first, and optimize your diet and lifestyle. Best wishes."

Of course I kept it up. $2000.00 later, I knew how bad that was. I after seeing my doctor, am now back on it. The side effects of knocking into corners, doorjambs, etc. has started again. I was typing very well, once again I am now searching for the keys. I can't figure out words. I forget things almost as they happen. I will deal with this, because after trying so many, this WORKS.

Lamictal worked somewhat, but not by itself. I was also started on ECT (electroshock therapy) which I have been getting once a month for more then two years. I am on the Lamictal at 300mg as a maintenance med in-between my shock treatments.  It seems to have improved my mood balance. I have some co-morbid conditions such as ADHD, GAD, which I take other meds for. The main thing I notice with the Lamictal is it is neutral for weight gain, and doesnt turn me into a total walking Zombie like the other mix of 6 different meds. As for other side-effects, I have a few but unknown whether caused by ECT, or the other meds?

And I don't think I am liking it too much. My Dr told me that it was a great medicine and that he hadn't heard of many side effects. Well, after 10 days of this, I have not stopped vomiting, have had a chronic headache, memory issues, dizzy every morning, dry mouth, bad dreams, and it feels like my throat is closing up. Writing seems to be affected in that I am now leaving out at least two words in every sentence and have to really proof read everything I do (writing here is no exception). I am SO glad I took the time to read these reviews to see that I am not alone in experiencing these things. I am on 300mg a day, to match the 300mg of Dilantin I was taking. The funny thing is - during the migration from Dilantin to lacmictal, I felt fine and alert and better than I've ever felt for as long as could remember. It was when I went off the Dilantin completely that I've begun to feel this way. Even sitting here typing this I feel on the verge of vomiting, which has not gone away for a SINGLE MOMENT. I switched to Dilantin due to the issues with the gums, and who knows what else as I age. But so far, I would rather go with the devil that I know, Especially when reading that some people are still experiencing seizures, ""just not as many"". Well when I was on Dilantin, I NEVER had seizures unless I forgot to take it for several days. I drive to much to gamble with my life and HOPE that this medicine works. I know I've only been on it for a very short time, but no medicine should make you feel this way when the Dr recommends it. But hey - I didn't develop a rash! I don't know if I can take this any longer."

Working great, can tolerate things better. On 1st 25mg X 2 wks, got itchy 1 hour after taking. Red spots that itched--took half an antihistamine if itching too bad. Itch the red spots & got hives just where I itched bad. Itching went away in 3-4 hours if no antihistamine was used. The results are really great, used to fly off the handle at the smallest things, really moody, but not anymore. Life seems more tolerable.  Maybe I found the perfect mix finally, Effexor and Lamictal (ya along with my Buspar & Xanax). Felt like a guinea pig for years now, but this is the best I've felt in a long time.

Before I used to stay in bed all day and took absolutely no pleasure in doing anything. But no I have got my mojo back and am starting to become more active. Still have some trouble sleeping and am taking Seroquel to help sleep and also to boost the effect of the Lamictal, it's not as good as Benzos but at least it is not addictive.  Currently taking 75mg of Lamictal and am gradually increasing to 200mg. Only side effects I have noticed are a slight unsteadiness when getting up and some insomnia. I have a soft bipolar II with only moderate hypo-manic episodes, still enough to make me do stupid stuff. Hope others find Lamictal as effective at treating bipolar depression as I have.
One more thing, does the ease of use rating seem a bit redundant, as the vast majority of medications are taken orally it is not exactly difficult to swallow a pill. Just a thought."

I've been taking it about 1-1/2 yrs and it definitely helps level my moods, it's not a cure-all I still have my ups and downs, but the swings are much less sereve and the are manageable (in fact the hypo-manic feeling I get is actually nice compared to the hyper-manic shooping sprees followed by crash and burn).
As noted this may not work for everyone, and it does take a while to start feeling the full effects, 3-6 months was my experience.
As far as side effects, I am on 300mg and I though maybe I was still a little to manic, so I was increased to 400mg and started having irratability and anger problems (which is a little known potential side affect), going back to 300mg solved that.
Just wondering though about the long term use of the product, in my experience some things would work for a while and then ""turn"" on me (Lithium for one) or stop being effective.  I'm wondering about memory issues specifically, short term, cloudy (foggy)thinking, etc."

I was diagnosed with depression and after trying several meds that caused bad side effects, Lamictal has been great. It took 6 weeks for the initial side effects such as itching, water retention, flush cheeks, etc. to go away, but after this period, the Lamictal kicked in and totally lifted the depression. at 150 mg,I am very happy with it.
I have noticed a slight rash which looks pimples when upping the dose. It goes away in a few days with Cortizon cream and Benadryl. I have also noticed that I am more hungry than before but I have not gained weight. I did lose 30 lbs I gained on Zyprexa. As far a rash goes, everyone is so stressed about the SJS rash, but not all rashes that occure are serious. It is sad that so many people see a small rash and panic, going off the med. I received a terrible rash with Lyrica and still have the scars from that. All of these meds can cause rashes. Its best to let your doctor check it out but chances are that 99% of rashes are okay and will go away."

621$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/10/2009 3:37:09 PM$Reviewer: HopefulMom, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$"My almost 6 year old son began taking Lamictal last month. Yes, we know it isn't ""approved"" for use in children, but he is in the care of a top notch child psychiatrist and his response to the medication has been remarkable.

A bit of history:  My son has had an ADHD dx for over a year, but clearly something else is going on, resulting in enormous rages and persistent irritability.  Also hugely swinging moods throughout the day that were unpredictable.  He was expelled from kindergarten after a particularly awful outburst at school in which he hurt another student and his teacher.  We made the excruciating decision to hospitalize him for safety reasons and try to get to the bottom of things.

After starting Lamictal, in addition to the risperdal and focalin he was already taking, his moods are smooth and emotion is appropriate to the situation.  No more rages and he's able, with help, to talk about what he feels and find solutions.  He started a new school and is doing very well socially and academically.  He's affectionate again, which is a big plus for mom and dad. :-)  Basically, now we have a 6 year old who fits in with the other 6 year olds and feels good about himself.     

NO negative side effects to this point.  Currently on 25 mg after building up slowly from 10.

We know things can get rocky again in the future, as he grows and his body chemistry changes, but for now we're VERY SATISFIED and hopeful.        "

I started taking Lamictal 200mg, Seroquel 100mg and Zolof 100mg from Nov. 2007. In the beginning it was a miracle drug.  My mood swings were less frequent and less severe, buy my dreams were like epic moving. They were so real I felt exhausted when I woke up. So after a year I stopped taking the Seroquel and the dreams were far less dramatic and vivid.  

Lamictal over all has been a great drug for me it works far greater than Paxil ever did. BUT... 

MEMORY LOSS
I a have been experiencing Memory loss that is beginning to scare me. During 2008 I notice this side effect but it was so minor that it was a liveable trade off for finally finding help with my depression after suffering for about 10 years. 

NOW, my short term memory is terrible, before when I had forgoten something, if reminded I would recall whatever I had forgotten.  Now when I forget something there is no trace of what was said or asked of me. I am also seeing signs of long term memory loss as well. I am so scared it is the Lamictal. Is there anyone out there experienceing Memory loss and feel it is the Lamictal?"

I have not had a single episode since I began taking it, and I haven't had any negative side effects. Remembering to take the pill can be an annoyance, but once I got in the habit it hasn't been a problem. I feel so normal on Lamictal- like I don't have a seizure disorder at all. In fact, I almost think my friends believe that I'm perfectly fine and making it all up! I feel perfectly comfortable driving, swimming, climbing ladders, and all the other things they say aren't safe for someone who has seizures. Again, I love Lamictal.

I started taking Cymbalta at the same time, which I think has resulted in most of the improvement, but Lamictal is definitely doing something right. I have never experienced ANY side effects from Lamictal. I take 300 mg a day; 100 mg in the morning and 200 mg at night. I have not been significantly depressed or manic since I started taking this drug, which is the longest break since my diagnosis 5 years ago. My doctor started me at 25 mg for 5 days, then 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and finally to 300 mg, with each increase 5 days apart. I think anyone who has tried a lot of medications with no success should definitely consider giving Lamictal a try.

I've been on it for 14 months and I noticed hair loss almost immediately. I can handle the hair loss to a certain extent, but I will consider other options if it gets to be too much. My short term memory is a lot worse than it was before beginning Lamictal. I've addressed the issue with my doc and she said that it is a symptom of bipolar, not a side effect of the drug. I don't agree necessarily. I've always had memory issues, but I noticed a drastic decline when I started the drug. Again, if it gets too much worse I'll consider an alternate treatment. Besides those two very frustrating side effects I've been very pleased with my moods. I take 300 mg and 300 mg Wellbutrin and the combo is working well so far. I also have ringing of the ears due to the Wellbutrin, but that's a story for another day LOL.

[200mg at 8am-200mg at 8p = 400mg per day.]

Effectiveness:
I chose 4 because before I was put on this medication I was having 1-3 Grand Mal Seizures a week. Since I have been on this medication (3years) I'll have a seizure maybe twice a year. This has stopped me from being able to drive but I would rather not drive and use public transportation then suffer brain damage from my epilepsy.

Ease of Use:
I chose 4 because this medicine is fairly easy to take, it is chalky so you should drink something along with taking this medication. Because of it being chalky and the extreme bad taste of this drug it deserves 4 stars.

Satisfaction:
With satisfaction, it has to be 4 stars, not quite 5 because I have noticed that I experience jerking of my muscles every once in awhile, usually in my face or my upper body (if you have the same kind of epilepsy as me, you know what I am talking about and how bad and scary this feels). Also ever since I have been on this medication, like I said 3years, there are lots of times where I just think I am going to fall, like my muscles are going to give out. I have noticed that I have a lot of hair loss (alot), but you wouldnt notice it by looking at my because I have so much of it. One more thing, I have noticed that since I have been taking Lamictal that I have been ""slower"" if you will, clumsy, and very forgetful, but side effects is something youre just going to have to deal with no matter what medication you are on with epilepsy..

If you are a parent and you are looking into getting your child epileptic medicine for their grand mal seizures, I suggest you get this drug, it is better than any other medication that I have been on for epilepsy"

It took a while to find the medications that worked for me.  Don't be worried about taking more than one drug either.  I have been taking Lamictal for 3 1/2 YEARS.  I am taking 400 mg and have been for most of that time period.  I have had excellent results on this med, and have had no side effects at all, ever, nor have I had any significant weight gain.  This medicine has worked wonderful for ME.  It has stabilized my mood dramatically.  I also take Wellbutrin 450 mg, and Seroquel 100 mg.  This is the ""cocktail"" of meds that have worked for me.  As I said, I have been on this combo of drugs for 3 1/2 years.  Medicine affects everyone differently.  Don't think that just because one person had serious side effects that you will also.  This medicine may be just what you need.  Sometimes you have to trust the doctor more than the reviewers.  The doctors know what the side effects may be.  They are in no way trying to hurt you!  They trying to help you the only way they know how!  Good luck and God bless you!  There is hope, just don't give up!"

I started gaining weight almost immediately, and in just a few months I'd put on 20 pounds. I was an active college student and have been a vegetarian for most of my life, so my weight hadn't been a problem before. After several horrible medication changes (took Topamax for a few weeks only to have severe cognitive side effects, dizziness, and tingling feeling all the time - then moved on to Trileptal, which left me even heavier and very depressed), my neurologist put me back on Lamictal in 2006. Since 2006 I have gained another 20 pounds and am absolutely miserable. Unfortunately I am very sensitive to meds, so the cognitive and physical side effects of other medications hit me pretty hard. Overall Lamictal/Lamotrigine has kept my seizures at bay (I still have an occasional partial complex, but no grand mals since 2006). I am hoping to find a better solution so I can lose the weight and be seizure free. Ugh!

A big difference was seen in my anxiety.  I tried cymbalta which only made me sick to my stomach and very dizzy.  Lamictal was a god send.  I do get dizzy from it but it usually is at night which I can tolerate it. The doctor paired it with neurotin.  Neurotin and lamictal work well together for severe anxiety.

This is incorrect, every oen and everybody is different. I started on 25 mg and increased very slowly and STILL got stevens johnson syndrome. i.e. this ""rash"" that they talk about. So that information is misleading. and about the scary info you ""need not see"", exactly the contrary. This is the information I wish i WOULD have known about before i took Lamictal and it changed my life forever, and definitely not for the better. Am in contant pain now after SJS almost claimed my life. Yes, you should all ask your doctor's questions, many questions. But the scary pictures are the truth and what people do need to see. My doctor told me starting out slow and on the 25mg for 1st week, 50 for second and 75mg for 3rd, it could possibly DECREASE the chance, NOT completely eliminate it. Everryone please be careful. Any signs of a ""rash"" puffy swollen eyes or fever headache..ANYTHING like this..please tell your dr. Asap . if you do get the reaction..it may not stop on it's own there is a chance it may have to run its course and won't stop blistering and burning up your body. It also may not stop it from becoming permanently disabling or disfiguring, which happened to me. God Bless you all.

*This medication is not supposed to be given to children 16 and under, as it can increase the risk of you getting the rash. * Please be careful all."

667$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/29/2009 9:05:30 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$First tried Depakote- that crap didn't work. Now I'm on Lamictal, started with 25mg and Im up to 200mg a day (ive been on lamictal for about 2.5 months). Lamictal doesnt do anything for me. Still pissed/still depressed. I was diagnosed with bipolar NOS
668$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/29/2009 5:47:42 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$I have been on Lamictal for three months and have seen little or no change in my bipolar disorder. At times, I think I feel even more helpless and depressed as before taking it. I still have the same periods of wanting to stay in bed, being happy one minute and sad the next, and feeling like I hate my life despite having a good life. I also have gained weight because of lack of interest in going to the gym (which I used to go 4-5 times a week) therefore gaining almost ten pounds in three months. At my next psychiatrist visit, I am going to tell him to take me off this drug and try a new one. 
669$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$9/28/2009 10:03:20 AM$Reviewer: 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $3$3$3$My son started on this med at 18 months with full frontal grand mall seizures, he still has breakthrough seizures periodically. Resently the Dr's increased his meds, shortly therafter he exhibited mood and personality changes, he cannot concentrate, cannot focus, he is angry violent and loud, he cannot sleep or eat and is just manic....The doctors are trying to say this is ADD I am concerned this is the med, since it appeared so suddenly and we have had no changes in his life other than the increase, he has been on the med for over 2 yrs and they do not want to switch meds....has anyone heard of similar situations?

671$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/27/2009 1:01:33 PM$Reviewer: Tweetyheart, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$2$I was quite scared of getting the rash after reading all of this.  But if you start quite slowlly and go up only by 25 mg per week you'll be fine. Start slow.  That's the key to keeping the rash away.  That's the hard part for me because I often forget how many pills to take so I'll update again when I'm on my top dfose and no rash.  If I get the rash I'll let you know.  Just to be fair.  I'm caucasian and they say asians are more prone to get the rash.  I'm quite hopeful for this medication.  I'm only on week 2, 50mg a day, and I'm feeling a difference.  I hope this will be helpful.  Thank everyone! If you're scared of the reash, ask your doctor lots of questions and don't seek it out online, there is scary info and pictures out there that you need not see. I wish I had never sought online info out.  I'll keep you poste4d on what happens to me!  Thanks! Bye!

675$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/22/2009 6:32:02 PM$Reviewer: dog_gone, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Have been on Lamictal 100mg.then upped to 150mg.I found this very effective It gives me time to respond properly to a negitive situation in a positive manner. Has really helped w/ Bi-polar type II, evening out the symtoms (higs & lows) much more effectively than any other phyc. drug I've taken (dealing w/ bi-polar issues for 15+ yrs.)It took 2 months to show positive results but worth the wait!! I take it in combination w/seroquel 50 mgs.per day for sleep.I'm adding lexapro for obsessive negative thoughts that I've been dealing w/ for years - used major trancs.for in the past. One negative side effect was when I first started taking lamictal I actually lost (temporarily) my ability to spell even very simple words. Lamictal does not have any sexual side affects nor does it put you in a stupor like some of the other major players do.

 ive experienced horrible headaches, almost daily - sometimes it will go away for a day, but always comes back - although it didnt get any worse with upping my dose.  i LOVE this medicine.  i have not found IN YEARS any med that works for me.  ive tried seroquel, geodon, haldol, zanax, seroquel, ect. and still havent been satisfied.  i like the almost ""euphoric"" feeling, while not feeling intoxicated, like the benzos.

also, i had a small rash.  it went away in two days.

a will admit, it is MORE difficult to sleep.  when i do, i get a RESTFUL sleep, and dont need coffee in the morning.  ( but now, my mornings are 1 pm => )
im overall satisfied, it is the only med that delays/STOPS my muscle spasms.  im happy.  i still need help, but now i am at a place to start"

I still have about 20 absence seizures a day with my Lamictal. It also made me a little slow. I've also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, so it's never helped me at all in that department. Not to mention I've vomited several times because the taste is disgusting!! If you've ever let it stay in your mouth a little too long you know exactly what I'm talking about.

I finally feel some happiness in my life. I havent had any really bad side effects other than an upset stomach for about an hour after i take it, and trouble getting to sleep. Once i get to sleep it's great i sleep thought the night. One last side effect for me has been swollen lymph nodes its pretty painfull on my left side. Other than the side effects i feel that Lamical is just what i have been waiting for after all the meds i have tried i think this may be it.

However, this medication is the closest to ""normal"" I guess I'll ever be.  All other medications for this disorder have made me gain weight.  I have lost 60 lbs since starting lamictal 3 yrs ago.

691$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/2/2009 3:53:39 PM$Reviewer: lgp, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I am a nurse and accidently took a double dose of Lamictal, a total of 800mg.  I experienced absolute loss of motor control, severe visual disturbance, nausea, vomiting, strange and very frightening feelings in my brain. With the above symptoms i could not move at all unless vomiting and then would spill the container due to loss of motor control. I live alone and very far out in the country and couldn't crawl to get the phone but did definately need medical attention. The signs and symptoms of overdose subsided in about 12 hrs but in that amount of time I was sure I was dying.  I now use a pill box since I have had subsequent questions about whether or not I have taken my medication.  Please be careful!

I got the dreaded stevens johnson syndrome as a side effect of Lamictal. The red painful eyes was a symptom of SJS, the allergic reaction. I know you posted about a month ago. But i hope everything is ok with you now. But from my experience...red, swollen, painful puffy eyes were signs that I was getting an allergic reaction, which was when I got the SJS. So please be careful and also watch for swollen glands, sore throat, fever, and headache, as these could also be signs you are getting the allergic reaction. God Bless and I hope all works out for you"

I have tried taking it in the morning due to the drowsiness.  As for my mood much better but being tired all the time makes me very irritable.  I also take 30mg of Ritalin for severe depression this helps the tiredness during work but when I crash about 10 hrs after taking it I'm not worth being around.  I'm depressed, have no emotion, have NO motivation.  Don't really no what to do now.  I wish everyone the best of luck no matter what meds you are on do not stop until your doctor tells you to.

This taste will linger for some time no matter what you try to drink afterwards, tea, milk etc. When swallowing this med do not let any portion touch the roof of the mouth or the back of the throat, again to prevent the bitterness.

I hate not knowing if Lamictal is working or not.  No rashes.  I don't seem to have a sense that it is ""working great and has changed my life"". I sleep ok, eat the same, etc.  Is the Lamictal making me so mellow that I don't even realize it?  I still get depressed but not as manic.  OCD, ADD, mood swings are doing me in.  My wife is an angel and has suffered with me.  My 11 year old son is starting to ask, ""Dad, I hate when you can't remember.  Why can't you find your keys?""

I've suffered from complex partial seizures in the main, and had terrible sleep problems, with some sleep seizures. No matter how long I slept I was exhausted and had occasional bouts of depression - probably because I was so exhausted.  I'd taken other anti-convulsants (several) but always discontinued them because of side-effects: a dulling of the senses/reduction of intellectual capacity.  I also took anti-depressants on a few occasions when things got out of hand.  They stablised my mood but the sleep situation/daytime exhaustion was awful.  About 18 months ago I started to take Lamictal and within a few weeks, I returned to being ""normal"". It had been so long since I felt like that it was a complete shock and totally unexpected.  I actually had no idea how difficult and strange my life had become.  I now wake up in the morning feeling refreshed (I'd forgotten what this felt like) and I can funtion like a normal human being and have only occasional seizures.  I did develop a rash at the beginning but the drug was so beneficial that I put up with it reduced the dose slightly, and then increased it again.  I did some research and found out most most rashes are not serious and I was prepared to to take the risk.  I wish I had known this drug was available a decade ago; it has transformed my life.   The only drawback initially is that I had some difficulty locating words/names but this wore off. I've always been anti-medication but this drug has changed my mind-set! "

Due to the constant struggle not to gain weight, and not succeeding, I am going off the drug. Most people say this does not cause weight gain but that has not been my experience, although it is difficult to tell how much may also be middle age weight gain. I also experienced night time wakening which added to the weight gain.

I can't sleep or even hold the baby right now because the itch is so intense. I've been off this horrible medication for weeks now and things are getting worse.

For the first time in my life I'm assertive, and actually get agitated at times. (I kinda was like Eeyore- nothing could really make me mad, I was just always sad.) This has been an amazing discovery for me, because I finally feel more normal. My friends and family see it too. I'm finally giving normal responses instead of being passive and hiding under my rock. 

No sexual side effects for me. 

One concern I've heard though- is that I display symptoms of mania a bit. I never ever have. I only ever expressed depressed and really depressed. So it's something I keep an eye on. "

I even weaned myself off of it after about 2 years. Now 3 yrs later, that pesky bipolar depression is back and effecting my job, so for insurance reasons, I have been taking the generic version,lamotrogine, which is not as effective as lamictal. I have been on lamotrogine for about a year now (50mg). I get a bad headache if I don't take it on time, I feel like it is not working as well as it did at first and i am slowly becoming a space cadet. Dizzy, forgetful, confused, unmotivated. I have been bipolar for so long and tried soooo many different meds. none of them have been the answer, but lamictal worked the best so far...NOT LAMOTROGINE. Side note on the other meds i have tried: Paxil, Prozac and Wellbutrin =zombie. adderall and ritalin= heart palpatations, major anxiety, shaky, difficulty breathing. (ritalin less bothersome than adderall) Trileptil (oxcarbenzapine)= major allergic reaction (swollen itchy red blistery hands and a rash, but steroids was quickly administered. It wasn't as bad as the other person below. (I feel for you.) I advise when taking any new meds, do it in the daytime when your drs office is open and while someone is with you, just in case of an allergic reaction. A Dr. visit is always cheaper than the emergency room. If you are like me, you just want to feel somewhat productive in this life and not so out of it all the time. Bottom line is that everyone is different and YOU are your best advocate, so speak up and do your research if somethings not working.

I started taking Lamictal in 2002.and almost 7 years later I am still suffering the effects Lamictal has left on me. As a result of taking Lamictal,I developed Stevens Johnson Syndrome...this is the ""rash"" the doctor's might tell you about as a side effect. SJS however is far more than that. If you get this so called ""rash"" from Lamictal...it gives you a reaction that litterally makes your skin peel off and blister and cause your skin to have chemical burns from the inside out. This was an extremely awful and painful experience. I was in the burn center for 6 weeks and gave me a ventilator, because the skin on my lungs was sloughing off as a result of the medication and I couldn't breathe on my own. I would give anything to go back and never have taken Lamictal. Maybe for some people, when you have no other option, you might have to use it as a last resort..but for me their were so many other options. You also have to watch out for swollen lymph nodes this could be a sign that you are getting an allergic reaction. The chemical burns from the Lamictal made it so there were blisters in my eyes and now I have unbearable eye pain and eye problems. My eyes do not look normal I have redness pain, dry eye syndrome,(severe,I have to use eyedrops about 10-20 times a day) photophobia,trichiasis,blepharitis,droopy,swollen eyelids, and constant eye infections because of this. I have scars and have also lost all my fingernails and toenails because I lost my nail beds as a direct result of Lamictal. I also am very sensitive to hot and cold temperature and cannot be out for long periods of time.IMPORTANTIf you get SJS..it MIGHT NOT STOP AFTER YOU STOP THE MEDS... IT MAY HAVE TO RUN ITS COURSE!Now,if you are thinking, this happened to just one of those people who are one out of a million, you are wrong The risk is a lot higher than you think. just please be careful and ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME"

I was prescribed lamotrigine and seroquel. I was slowly brought up to 100 mg. I started cycling rapidly in December. My depression cycle wasn't nearly as depressed as usual(always dreaded the down side.)My practitioner went over how and when I was to take seroquel and increased my Seroquel dose to 100mg, but left my lamotrigine dose at 100mg since it seemed to be working for the depressive episodes . In the 5th month i had an extremely mean manic episode for three days, followed by 2 days of extreme depression where I couldn't leave the house without crying, pretty much, the whole time I was out. My dose was increased to  200mg/day and my seroquel was also increased to 200mg. Within a month I felt better and I finally am thinking more clearly. I'm starting to think I can trust my own judgement again. 
I believe I have finally found the dose that works for me. My manic episodes are usualy the opposite of the way I should be feeling in certain situations.
I do have an increase of appetite and only in the past 2 months did I gain 10 lbs. There are other factors that may be the reason for this. By keeping in mind that it increases appetite I watch my portions and try to avoid snacking. Difficult but doable. 
During the first 5-6 months I would get really drowsy but I had changed from a 2nd shift job to a 3rd shift one. now that I'm unemployed I have a better sleep pattern and  I no longer get as drowsy.
In summary I am very happy with the combinatio and dose of my meds. Keep in mind every one is different. Most importantly take them faithfully. I had some problems when I'd miss a few doses. I am afraid not to take them."
744$Condition: Other$6/14/2009 10:11:54 PM$Reviewer: Charles, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$4$Fantastic!  Lamictal and Eskalith combination has given me a productive life for over 10 years!  Just keep watching for symptoms and keep everything in balance.  READ the manufactures paper that the pharmacy receives with the original package. Vs. all of the negative comments I have read here seam to be from overdose. --- 300 to 400mg total of Lamictal per day and 1800mg total of Eskalith CR per day for a person 230lb has been ideal for me.  The Lamictal supplements the Eskalith for an excellent result. I carefully monitor myself for signs of a missed dose or overdose of either.  Again, READ the literature with the bottle!  If I see signs of high dosage due to changes in what I may have eaten etc, I back off one tablet that evening – Lithium if I get a sinus headache, or Lamictal - if ANY rash or non puss pimples appear you’ve got overdose on your skin and every organ in your body – read the literature!  For either a high absorption or a missed does of Lithium will cause a sinus headache as a first sign.  I use Alka-seltzer Cold Plus which helps the sinus headache quick.  My psychiatrist is a genius and has carefully guided me through the last 10 years of medications and identifying how to improve my decision making.  He also helped me diagnose and treat a tick which causes me to have a dry unprovoked tickle and cough.  ---- My advice is 1st-Watch for symptoms and correct immediately.  2nd. Do not EVER stop taking a medication.  Hell will rule the storm of emotions maybe 20 times worse than if you reduce dosage slowly and replace with the guidance of your doctor.  Know your warning symptoms by reading the pharmacy original literature.  There is a fine line between excellent dosages vs. overdose!  Lamictal and Eskalith are awesome! I was one of the first using Valporates.  It does work but garbage compared to Lamictal!

I was on Seroquel and Zyprexa for years, and although I felt well with those two, I just kept gaining so much weight, going from 190 lbs to 270 lbs in five years.

My bi-polar symptoms started to come back albeit in a manageable way.

It seems that for my doctor he saw this as a good ""excuse"" to put me on Lamictil.  He could not have made a better decision.

It took some time and dosage adjustments and in addition balance this with treating my other issues.

However, I started to lose my weight, and at the same time, my moods have been stable for nearly two years.

Like any other drug, it won't work for everyone, but with my experience with losing my weight and having my moods stabilized this is worth a consideration by you and and your doctor.

The knock down in ease of use is that I need to take two 150 mg for 300 mg.  It may never happen but I would like to see a single 300 mg."

My body doesn't respond to most generics, and Lamotrigine is one of them (unfortunately), so I may have to find another way to get the ""real deal"" again. I've been on Lamictal 5 years now. I know I'll get kidney failure eventually, but maybe then, there'll be something even better out."

When i finally mellowed out a year later i decided that i felt fine so i wanted to get off this drug. After my doctor slowing weening me off about two months later i tried to commit suicide... twice. Needless to say i'm back on the drug and yes its helped me but i will have to take this medication for the rest of my life. Look into other options if you can first.

My manic episodes have dramatically decreased and my lows are nowhere near as low as they were. The only real side effect I've noticed is that sometimes when I should be particularly angry or excited about something, the reaction is quiet and subdued. However, compared to what I WAS dealing with, this drug has been something of a miracle cure. I no longer find myself yelling all the time and angry. I'm happy with my life.

After about a month after seeing many docs, we finally figured out that it was a rare side effect of the Lamictal.  Now I'm on Lithium and Abilify, still not as happy with them as i was on the Lamictal.  If you notice any of those symptoms, don't hesitate, call your doc!

My m.d. informed me that the side effects of generic have been increased probability of breakthrough seizures. Even so, I had almost no choice than to go generic seeing as it was over $500 a month WITH insurance vs. $20 for generic. I have been on Lamictal + Keppra for almost 4 years now(2 1/2 years seizure free which is an amazing feat for me)and have had the worst of the side effects. Rash, blurry double vision, sleeping troubles. But being on the generic for just three weeks now, I have noticed slight changes in these side effects bad and good. The good thing is, for me, that I am getting less of the sight based problems. I still get woozy a bit in the mornings but not near what I had been experiencing. No changes in sleep habits. I am still quite tired during the day and very alert at night. Bad side effect for me though, is that I have noticed being remarkably more sensitive to light. Expressly sunlight. I have never had any trouble being outside for prolonged periods of time. I've been involved with outdoor activites at my son's school and each time I came home sick and more rash than normal.  Again, these are my own personal experinces and by no means general effects. But I consider myself a lab rat of sorts, knowing effects of brand name and knowing possible effects of generic.

The most important thing is to decide if it is worth taking the risk. Talk with your m.d. and see what they say. If they encourage you to stay on brand, then ask them about patient assisstance programs. Until I started working, I was on a program for three years and only paid $10 for a 3 month RX of two different drugs. 

I hope this helps you out SweetOne, let me know on here if you have anymore questions."

I know it takes a while to get into your system but I can already feel the effects. I have blurred vision all the time, and I feel like a zombia, Im always depressed can't even smile.  I kinda liked having the hypomania part of the disorder at least then people liked to be around me. I know others have noticed a change in me because they tell me they don't like my attitude, and I have to work with ALOT of people and care for teenagers who are brutally honest. Im sick of explaining myself. I was diagnoised 2months ago and still havent gotten better I cry all the time and Im very angry and I fight with my partner all day every day. I hate how I feel why does it take so long why don't the doctors really listen Im sorry but they are a joke. I don't even know if I agree with them about being bipolar everyone else that knows me and that I have worked with for 7yrs feel im not and just think Im ADHD which that is what I agree with. But no damn doctors won't listen Im really about to bug on them and tell them about themselves Im the one paying them and for what to feel like crap everyday what a joke. I just want to be happy and function and be the best that I can be as a mother, counselor and wife. This medication has sucked the joy out of me which prior to had none anyways but somehow I do feel worse, and this rash thing scares the crap out of me. I have enough medical problems as it is don't need anymore, and I am very young I just want to enjoy life instead of wanting to end it...

I started taking Lamictal in 2002...and almost 7 years later I am still suffering the effects Lamictal has left on me. As a result of taking Lamictal,I developed Stevens Johnson Syndrome...this is the ""rash"" the doctor's might tell you about as a side effect. SJS however is far more than that. If you get this so called ""rash"" from Lamictal...it gives you a reaction that litterally makes your skin peel off and blister and cause your skin to have chemical burns from the inside out. This was an extremely awful and painful experience. Lamictal sent me to the burn center for 6 weeks and gave me a ventilator, because the skin on my lungs was sloughing off as a result of the medication and I couldn't breathe on my own. I would give anything to go back and never have taken Lamictal. Maybe for some people, when you have no other option, you might have to use it as a last resort..but for me their were so many other options. You also have to watch out for swollen lymph nodes this could be a sign that you are getting an allergic reaction. The chemical burns from the Lamictal made it so there were blisters in my eyes and now I have unbearable eye pain and eye problems. My eyes do not look normal I have redness pain, dry eye syndrome,(severe,I have to use eyedrops about 10-20 times a day) photophobia,trichiasis,blepharitis,droopy,swollen eyelids, and constant eye infections because of this. I have scars and have also lost all my fingernails and toenails because I lost my nail beds as a direct result of Lamictal. I also am very sensitive to hot and cold temperature and cannot be our for long periods of time. It is such a hassle and has hindered me in life. Now,if you are thinking, this happened to just one of those unlucky people who are one out of a million, you are wrong The risk is a lot higher than you think. It is 1/100. just please be careful and ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME. God Bless"

It's supposed to last for 24 hours, yet seems to run out of my system about every four hours.  After the fourth hour I start to have speech problems, disorientation, and my head starts to shake as though I have a neuromuscular problem.  Also, whereas I used to have a great memory and was able to think quickly and clearly most of the time, I now find myself being very spacey, having a hard time remembering things and generally being discombobulated.  When I've tried, with my doctors plan of slowly weening me off the medication, I've felt so desperately horrible that I've had to get right back on it.  This is a horrible drug and I am really in despair.  How am I suppose to get off of this medication and still be able to work?  I think this must be what a drug addict must go through when experiencing withdrawal.  I hate this drug and feel trapped in it.  The company denies that I could be experiencing any of these symptoms from this medication even though I never had these symptoms until I began taking the medication.  Lovely.  Of course they must be correct.  I must be imagining the symptoms.  According to their studies, I must be...  I must rethink this situation.

828$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/1/2009 9:57:05 AM$Reviewer: Me, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was diagnosed Bipolar- II almost two years ago.Lamictal and Zoloft were the first drugs that were prescribed for me. I never felt right on the Zoloft or any SSRI or SNRI for that matter. I got up to the 300mg doses of lamictal and felt it had stopped being as effective as it was in the beginning. This took 1/2 year to poop out. I then started looking for alternatives as my Doc. at the time just wanted me to slowly increase lamictal, yet I felt I needed another med. Well, I went back to my first Doc. that diagnosed me, and tried different meds., but after reading a book called Bi-polar II, from the library I found that the gold standard, for Bi-polar is Lithium Carbonate ER. So I suggested this to my doc. and I have been taking it along with 150mg Lamictal for less than a week. I tell you, I have felt some calmness, and peace with the Lithium add-on already and look forward to more. She only started me at 300mg twice a day. We will do bloodwork soon to see if I need an increase for the theraputic level. I just wanted to pass this along to others, as lithium was the first med. available to treat bipolar and sometimes docs. go with the newer meds. that the drug companies produce. It may have side effects, check them out with your doc. So far though I have been excercising 30min. a day and cutting out gluten and sugars, eating more good carbs. and protein, no weight gain yet. I tell you the side effects may be so minimal for me that I don't feel anything but benefit for Lithium so far. I'll keep you posted.
I am in therapy every two weeks,working part-time, and have a great marriage with two great teenage girls. It isn't easy to make it trough each day, sometimes I force myself to sit back and be thankful for what I do have and have managed to keep up with considering my mental health and lack of sleep, (getting better). Thank you for all of your messages on Web MD, I have read many."

I began at 25 mg and have since moved up to 100 mg daily, a dose that I have been on for just over a month now.  I also take 150 mg Wellbutrin daily.  This combination seems to be working for me.  This is the first medication I have ever taken that has not given me side effects and that in itself makes a wonder drug for me!!  Taking this medication in conjunction with cognitive therapy is now a lifestyle for me and has improved my quality of life dramatically.  I experienced slight weight gain after the first month, but have since been able to maintain my weight through diet and exercise, something i was unable to do while on prozac (which caused horrible weight gain for me).  Both the generic and brand name lamictal are expensive.  if you do not have prescription insurance, go to www.bridgestoaccess.com and see if you qualify for GSK's help.  I qualified and now receive the brand name for free.  This program also includes many other GSK drugs so it is well worth looking into. (I receive my wellbutrin for free as well).  I wish others much success in their endeavour to maintain their bipolar disorder as well.

She is 24 now and we want to have kids and with the generic of depekote out and insurance not covering the real deal (the generic was not working for her... her valproic acid level was supposed to be high 80s, low 90s, it dropped to 32 in the two months she was taking the generic... that is high risk hospitilizing seizure level...), we decided to try Lamictal. The doctor wanted her to take 1 25mg in the morning with her 500mg depekote and 1 25mg at night with her 500mg depekote for the first week then 1 25mg in the morning and 1 25mg and 500mg depekote at night for the next week and slowly get on it that way and get off the depekote. Maybe two days after taking Lamictal, she got a sore in her eye and her lymph nodes began to swell slightly. The next day, she said her skin felt like it was crawling. The next day she broke out into a rash from head to toe. She got no sleep because she was itching so badly, her skin was crawling so badly, she couldn't stop scratching because it itched so badly it hurt. We tried benadril (sp?) oatmeal baths... nothing helped. After 5 days of this and her lymph nodes swelling to the size of golf balls and her doctor being out of town, she stopped taking it. After missing a day of taking it, she still had the rash, but her skin started tingling and she lost all feeling in her muscles and she said it felt like she had no muscles in her body... after two days the swelling in her lymph nodes went down significantly and the rash progressivly went away. She has been only taking her depekote (the real deal) regularly again like she used to but apparently it has not been working because while on Lamictal, her level went up to 86 but since she stopped taking it, its down to 51. She started taking Lamictal again last night just to keep from having a seizure and to get her valproic acid level back up and already her skin is crawling and she has a rash.

When I got to the 100mg, I started to notice a difference, and now that I'm on the 150mg, I really notice the side effects. 
Plus, NOTE THIS, I was told I could take Benadryl for the itching and/or simple rash. So I was having one of my many sinus attacks, so I looked through my medicine cabinet and took Benadryl Severe Sinus and Allergy....don't do that!  About an hour after I took it, I started to have nausea, chills and shaking, and a burning feeling in my chest and throat.  I finally passed out, due to what I still don't know.  When I woke up I very shakily drove the mile to my family drs office, and they gave me fluids, but weren't sure what was happening. I was still shaky, so I stopped at my pharmacy on my way home, and talked to the pharmacist. Right away, he informed me that I couldn't take any kind of decongestant with this medicine.  It will cause the same symptoms I went through (which, btw, leaves you with verrry little options.)  When I informed my psych doctor what I had gone through, she looked it up in her medical journal, and NO where did it say that you couldn't take a decongestant, so she was clueless.  I checked with another pharmacy and they automatically said the same as the other.  So I have learned, always talk to your pharmacist first - they are more knowledgeable about the interactions of drugs than anyone!"

Sounds like alot, but I have a high tolerance for pain and drugs.  Been on both for 4 years now - increased dose from 200 to 250 after coming off of meds during a pregnancy.  Was diagnosed bipolar at the age of 29 when mania set in. I love it - saved my life and my husbands. He had actually attempted suicide a few times before I was able to convince him to go to the doctor. He had social anxiety as well (which I think all bipolar people have).  You can't miss a pill and expect it to work - kind of like birth control. But the daily pill is worth the happiness, satisfaction and focus it brings to your life. I feel normal for the 1st time in my life.  I recently started taking the generic when it became available (so much cheaper), but after reading other's comments I think I'm going to go back to brand name.  I've been itching like crazy too - thought it was allergies.  And my mood swings have been wider with a poorer attention span.  I go to the doctor in a couple of days and was going to ask for a higher dose - I think switching back to name brand will relieve the new symptoms.  When I did quit taking the meds for my pregnancy I was so miserable - the only thing that kept alive were the babies inside me.  Had twins and didn't hold them but once or twice for the first week.  If anyone out there has stayed on lamictal throughout a prenancy (with or without issues) I would love to hear from you.  I want to try for another baby, but I'm not sure I (or my husbandd) can make it w/out the medicine. Good luck to all, I know how hard it is to find the right combo of drugs.  Just don't give up.

It sucks for me, because all the good it does is outweighed by the apathy, lethargy, oversleeping, migraines, and leg/back pain that I believe are related to this medicine. I have had a sick feeling all over since I started this stuff. I'm actually fighting with my doctor because I want to go off this drug. He gives me medicine for the migraines, and Adderall for the lethargy and sleepiness, and it's like I'm trying to use other medicines to cover up the side effects of Lamictal.

Over the past 20 yrs I have been diagnosed as having manic-depression, OCD, anxiety attacks, and most recently ADD. I take 200 mg of Lamictal in the morning, along with Buspirone (anxiety) and Dextroamphetamine (ADD). Occasionally I experienced a loss in my sense of balance, blurred vision, insomnia, and lower back pain. In the past 6 mos. these symptoms have become more intense, especially the back/hip pain and inability to fall sleep at night, as well as now experiencing some hair loss and a loss in my ability to concentrate. My psychiatrist felt this was due to stress, but I have become concerned after reading more about the drugs I am taking. My family physician does not feel there is any danger in the combination of pills I am taking, but also recommended that I trust my body's reactions. If I miss taking my meds for just one day, I am lethargic, sleepy, cranky and feel ill usually within 2-3 hours. When this happens on a weekend day, I will hole myself up and not leave the house. After reading all of the posts on this site, I want to see about talking with another pyschiatrist and the possibility of going off this medication. Please remember this is just my experience with Lamictal and besides the other medications, I'm sure there are many other variables in my situation.

I took Prozac for 5 yrs and it stopped working for me. My mood swings can be very ruff sometimes. I still have them but not as bad. I can really see a difference in my personality since I have been on Lamictal. I'm more calm but not sluggish. I do have a concern: Has anyone had any severe abdomen pain that comes ever 2 to 3 months? It's almost like bad cramps but you can't move. I'm not sure that this is related to Lamictal or not. Otherwise, I really love the medicine and have no side effects unless the abdomen pains are. If anyone has had similar symptoms please let me know.

I still have problems with my leg and my abdominal problems are still there, but I've only been off the stuff for 2 weeks. I'm not off ALL my meds, just the 2 I hated...I've kept up with my Lithium and MENTALLY feel 75% better than I did when on the other 2...but of course, there is still a lot of stuff outta whack, just need to try and find a different med for the depression and anger bull.

His Psychologist thought this would be great for him. He had mild depression, OCD and mood disorder. Within 10 days he developed a rash, then blisters, sores in his mouth, and a fever. When we took him to his pediatrician who had prescribed the medication, he said he had strep throat. I knew that wasn't right! The next day we were back at the pediatrician...he changed the antibiotic. That night we ended up in the Emergency room because his symptoms were worse and he couldn't breathe...they really didn't know what to do. They finally diagnosed him with Stevens Johnson Syndrome & he was transported to a hospital with a burn unit. He developed an infection and after 11 days passed away. I feel the doctor should have known the side effects and shouldn't have prescribed it because he was too young!! I wish I could go back in time. Please be careful with this medication & side effects!

I was diagnosed February my freshmen year of high school and they put me on Lamictal in June.  It treated some of my symptoms in the first month: extreme interest in sex, delusional thinking, depression, and others I can't even remember because they stopped.  I am a junior and I have been taking it.  I still have episodes and I am on Seroquel as well, but I do not have major depressive episodes anymore. I thought I was crazy before I took this medicine.  I didn’t want to live anymore and I thought I was just a sick twisted person.  It turns out I was sick, but not the monster I thought I was.  This medicine changed my life and saved me from myself.  When you first start taking it, the first week or two you are tired, but it goes away as your body adjusts.  Lamictal is a really good treatment for teenagers suffering from manic, depressive and hyper-manic episodes (Especially depressive: I was suffering depression my entire freshmen year until I got help).   Make sure that when you make changes with any kind of medication (doses or starting new ones), you do it when you are on some sort of break where you can adjust without stress and sleep.  I’m not sure how it works for others, everyone has different brain chemistries, but Lamictal works very well for me.

I'm on Lamictal 150-200mg a day. It varies due to the fact that at 200mg I get horrible migraines. At that point my ARNP will lower my dose to 150mg for a short time and then when I feel ready to live witht the headaches again we bump it back up. This usually only takes me a week or two of being at the lower dose before I want to be bumped back up. Two Hundred mg seems to be just where I need to be at to stabilize me. This to me is a WONDER DRUG. I was suicidal when I started on it. I started on the 5 wk starter pack and by the 3 wk I was feeling sooooooooo much better! I've done nothing but get better each day. I highly recommend it. I've always had a high sex drive but on Lamictal it's even higher, which my husband isn't complaining about! :-) The weight gain that I'm currently expiriencing does bother me and it's extremely hard to try and lose the weight once it's put on. I did try for 3 days to add Topamax w/Lamictal. Bad idea for me. Topamax made me fuzzy and unable to function. With Lamictal, I know now what it's like to be a ""normal"" person, the mood swings are still there but aren't severe anymore. I still have bouts of depression but not like before where I couldn't function at all. I'm now on the generic version and at this time haven't expirienced any adverse effects from switching to it."

I may not have the severity of hallucinations and hyperactivity.  I suffer from the depression way more than mania, I have gone three to four days in bed only to get up to eat and pee.  I started taking lamictal 4 years ago, but since I was self-medicating with illegals, it didn't have an affect.  When I cleaned up, 2 1/2 years ago, I tried again.  It's been a long process, when I wasn't in bed for days before, I never slept.  Still don't, I'm a teeth grinder, vivid dreamer.  But the Lamictal has helped me so much in other ways.  I went from being lost in the woods, never holding a job, I'm 28 and celebrating my first one year anniversary at an employer EVER! to finally feeling good and looking forward to life.  I'm at 400mg a day, supposed to be at night and morning but I have no memory so I take them in the morning.  I'm in college, married to a great man, who excepts me the way I am, and a beautiful daughter.  I still have my moments, when things go wrong, stress, missing work, schoolwork difficulties, but the difference I see in my life is amazing.  I've been put on other drugs in combination that have not worked.  Geodon is terrible!  Respidol, I lactated, look it up, it's a side effect.  And a few others.  I've decided to stick to Lamictal and just deal as long as I can.  I don't go to psych anymore, I was not getting any satisfaction out of my doctors.  We can do this ourselves!!  I would recommend to anyone that they discuss taking Lamictal with their healthcare provider.  And stay away from Geodon, I couldn't even drive on the stuff.

Generic is at $230. It will go down, but I've been pissed about it for a while. I tried to come off of it once when my insurance ran out, and it was the worst I have ever felt in my life.

that saves me alot. It's a good drug, i just had to be patient& give it a chance. The only drawback was the possible ""rash effect"" that really scared me at first to know i would be trying something that you could have a life threating reaction to.
all in all i am very pleased, but what pleases me more, that people have the same illness i have & we are gaining more support & not labled as just underachievers or plain pyshopaths. It really is upsetting

I have been hospitalized for severe manias and psychosis many times and I have suffered severe depression with my bipolar disorder also. I was diagnosed 15 years ago so I have been on many mood stabilizers with unpleasant side effects and limited success at controlling the symptoms of my illness. For the last 4-5 years I have had a stable mood while taking only Lamictal and Welbutrin. It's amazing when I think of how many meds I used to take and how difficult they were to tolerate.

I'd be fine and feel normal for months, sometimes a year at a time an then I'd be horribly anxious for months at a time. My primary cares always tried SSRI's which ALWAYS made me vomit and sent me to the ER. I was nervous about taking this medication but desperate because recently it had gotten to the point of me feeling so disconnected from everything that I was scratching myself just to feel something. I started Lamictal on the smallest starter kit the doctor had. I'm just going into week 5. The only thing I've had a problem with is anxiety. It's not worse but it's still there. But I'll take anxiety that I'm used to over overwhelming depression any day. I have an appointment today with the psychiatrist so maybe she will give me something for anxiety that works. Also, one weird side effect I noticed was this kinda ringing in my ears. It's not really like tinnitus (which I get sometimes)but it's more like when it's so quiet in a room that the quiet is deafening. Not sure if that makes sense but that's how I experience it. It's not a huge problem though. I've also notice a moderate increase in sex drive, which I'm not complaining about.

I the highest dose I was on was 600mg. I was eventually taken down to 500mg, partly because of the fact that I was developing headaches every morning and partly because 500mg seem to work. I was taking 3 in the morning and 2 at night, but within the last few months, my doctor had me take 2 in the morning and 3 at night. Amount switched hasn't effected me at all.

As for when the generic brand would be available, I can say that it is now available generically, under the name Lamotrigine. The pharmasist told my mom that it was now in generic form. I knew something looked different about it after my mom brought it home. I asked her about it and she said that it was the generic brand and that she as told that it will work the same as the Lamictal. I still had some of the Lamictal left, so I was taking that, until today, when I took the Lamotrigine. I was nervous about taking it, so I called the pharmacy and talk to one of the pharmasists and she told me that they just got the generic brand and that whenever they get a generic brand of a medication by law, they have to sell/use it. She also said that it should work the same as the Lamictal. That put my mind at ease after I hung up. I then went and googled Lamictal to find the ingredients so I could compare them to the ingredients in Lamotrigine, but couldn't find any info. on ingredients. Although in a lot of the links for Lamictal under google also mentioned Lamotrigine, so I figured that and Lamictal are the same thing. Oh and I think Lamotrigine is an ingredient in Lamictal.

With that said, you should be fine taking the generic brand, Lamotrigine instead of Lamictal. The mgs. of Lamictal you were taking will be the same, but the pills will look different. My mom also told me that the price was cheaper. I'm now paying $10 everytime I get it refilled as apposed to $20, i think it was.

Hope this helps"

Had a sudden major depressive episode with uncontrollable crying and thoughts of suicide.  Spent 4 out of 5 days in bed.  Started Lamictal, the 25mg kit, taking one pill every other day for two weeks, then one every day for two weeks, then 50mg a day for a week.  Doctor has now prescribed 100mg Lamictal along with 200mg Zoloft after I finish the sample kit.  Halfway into the third week is when I started to feel a slight improvement in my overwhelming depression at 25mg Lamictal daily.  I went from 100mg to 200mg of Zoloft and didn't feel a change until I took it in combination with Lamictal.  I think the side effects such as the insomnia and profuse sweating I'm experiencing is due to the Zoloft. I start the 100mg dose tomorrow.  I hope to see a considerable difference in my depression.

I myself am an MD who has had bouts of depression for decades. My anti-depressant, cymbalta, suddenly ""pooped out"" and I was left with probably the second-worst depression of my life. 

My doc recommended trying Lamictal given some atypical features of my depression and bipolar in my family. I noticed some improvement even on the low doses. About 90% response now on just 2 weeks of 200 mg daily. Only side effects are perhaps slight increase in headaches that I have always had, and occasionally feeling a little too ""keyed up"" for brief periods in the afternoon/evening.

They either didnt work, made me worse, or had terrible side effects that I could not tolerate. Lamictal was the only med that made me feel better (for a while) My dose was increased to 400mg which is a very large dose. I was a little better but still very depressed with suicidal thoughts.
I started ECT, and am taking Lamictal as a maintenence medication.  This combination with a mood stabilizer seems to work pretty well.  I still have mixed episodes of mania and depression, but way less often and less severe.  I think Lamictal has less side effects than any of the other meds I have taken, and little to no weight gain. All in all I think it is a good medication for bipolar depression."

While on effexor I lost my job and thought i was loosing my mind i was going crazy. Effexor has dangerious side effects that are terrible for a bi-polar person. I went back. He said that poopout is common with bi-polar people. He wouldnt comment on the effexor side effects. He gave me the bi-polar/seisure drug lamictal. Said it works for both. Been on it for 4 months. Practically no side effects and no more being tired. And feel level headed. Without the manic moods. Even though I liked the up's without the downs. This Lamictal is good stuff. I split my dosage to 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the evening. Works better for me. I give it 5 stars. The depression is 95% gone and the mood swings are 99% gone. Does not help with weight gain. But thats more mind over what you eat. I feel alot better than i have in the last 13 years now. Was a long bumpy road  finding out the right drug. But it works great now.

I started taking Lamictal in May of 2007.  Followed the prescribed ramp-up procedure.  Worked really well starting in 8/07.  Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, started having problems with ""lows"".  Doctor inceased my dosage from 200mg to 400mg per day.  Initially, good results.  I guess because it has happened so slowly,I did not realize that over the past three months, I have gotten extrememly weak, had no coordination, slurred speech and muscle soreness and pain.  The doctor instructed me not to take lamictal for 24 hours and then drop back to 200mg once a day.  The past week has been really tough, but I am beginning to get/feel better.  I was taking 200mg at bed time and then 200mg twelve hours later.  Since dropping back to 200mg, I have been taking my 200mg at 10:00 a.m.  Over the past few days, I am having real problems sleeping and it seemsto be getting worse.  "

Took Lamictal with Prozac.  Initial side-effects: sleepiness, no energy, I could feel my head being different for the first couple of weeks, dosage was eventually at 300mg, and was accompanied by severe migraines that would last for days. Dr. felt that counseling would help. I still have headaches, but less frequent and less severe, definately able to deal with. My issues with bi-polar- impulsiveness, sexual mania, 30# wt. loss, suicidal thoughts, sleeplessness, along with major depression. after maybe 6 months or so, dosage felt right, I felt stable, not feeling so out of control. I HATE taking the meds every day.  I was going to wean off once condition was in ""remission"". The two breakdowns each involved a suidide attempt and I have 6 kids. Not a risk I have decided to take. I have probably had earlier episodes, but was undiagnosed until severe breakdown. Breakdowns were majorly stress induced. Never thought I would go there again after first episode, but I did, approximately 8-9 years apart. I hope medication will keep disease and my health and safety safety. I am not at a therapeutic dose of 150mg with 60mg of Prozac. I have been feeling a little of the old sick self, so I may go back up. Everytime I change dose up or down I have sleep issues. Usually inability to sleep followed by sleeping for long periods. If I miss a dose I notice I have sleep issues, although only for a day or two. It takes alot of patience to get to dose that is right for you and finding the anti-depressant that may also be needed. This is a chemical imbalance...no different than high cholestrol, don't be deterred, not everyone has a respect for mental health. It may be what saves your life and give you a quality of life with your family. If not this med, then maybe another. Work with your Dr."

It took a little while to work, but I finally feel normal again. I used to sleep for 14 or more hours a day, but now can wake up after a normal night of sleep and function. My depression has lessened greatly. I still get the occasional hypo-manic episode, but not that often. I stopped the meds for several months, and my symptoms returned. Now that I have resumed treatment, I feel a ton better. This has reassured me that the medication really has made a difference.

I've noticed absolutely no negative side effects and wouldn't trade this RX for the world. Even though it is a bit expensive. I've also noticed that if i forget to take the dose one day, i feel no different. But i never miss more than ONE DAY. This coupled with Lexapro is a great cocktail for me.

For the first 3-6 years it worked very well.  After that it stopped working for me.  Currently, I am coming off the medication.  The most obvious withdrawal issue has been debilitating exhaustion.  It was stimulating for me in the years that it worked.  My doctor said the exhaustion/stimulation is not a common effect.  I think the exhaustion will go away the longer that I am away from using Lamictal.

I have been taking Lamictal with other medications- Trazodone for sleep and various antidepressants (which would tend to make me hypomanic).  Without antidepressants I still had depression.

If I want to stand up and put pants on one leg at a time, I can't because I'll fall. When I get excited about something my hand starts to tremble so I have to instantly calm down. This makes going to the gym or doing anything physical somewhat difficult. 

It's frustrating! On one hand it's working but on the other hand it's like I'm not even taking anything. I'm getting tired of all of this and some days I'm ready to say ""Enough is enough!"".

For the first time in my life, I got to experience 'normal'.  My seizures are in the temporal lobe, so I got to even feel normal emotions.  My sleep patterns were normal for the first time in my life.  I had a normal schedule.  I played with my kids outside.  I got angry without hate, I felt happiness without overconsuming joy.  My mind did not race anymore.  I could think and process one thought at a time.  I could play, work, sleep, and enjoy all the benefits of life I could never enjoy before.  I didn't even know it was possible to have that kind of of a life until Lamictal.  I thought I had found the answer to all my issues until one day, almost three months into my treatment, something terrible happened without warning.  I took my evening dose and exactly two hours later, my fever spiked to over 103, I developed a raised rash on my forehead, I began vomiting, and then I passed out out of nowhere.  I thought I had a virus.  I took my morning dose and the rash spread thru my scalp and began to peel off taking my hair with it.  I had never been so sick in my entire life.  I had to immediately stop the medicine due to Stephens Johnsons Syndrome.  Due to the sudden stop, I began going thru withdraw and the seizures became intense.  I don't know what will replace the Lamictal, but at least I know now what normal feel like.  I will recogonize it when I find it again.  Nothing else has come close yet.  I'm still looking.

I ALSO SENT MY BEST FRIEND TO HIM AND HE NOTICES AN IMPROVEMENT AFTER A FEW WEEKS.

DONT GIVE UP ON THIS MED.  GIVE IT SOME TIME.  YOU MAY NEED TO INCREASE DOSAGE.. CANT TAKE 100MG AT A TIME, DUE TO HEADACHES.
