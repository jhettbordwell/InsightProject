0$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/26/2017 12:14:35 AM$Reviewer:  Female  (Caregiver) $1$1$1$I just wanted to say this as a warning to parents out there. This drug has not been tested and approved by the FDA for treatment of ADHD. It actually has only been approved to treat high blood pressure. Similarly, it has not been found to be helpful in treating ADHD in children under 12 or even safe. The use of this drug is not recommended for children under age 12. I understand that it is often prescribed, but you should be aware that many doctors do not know that this drug has not been tested on children and is not approved to be given to them. Studies have been done on children over age 13 and have shown a marginal impact on ADHD behaviors. High Blood Pressure medicines have been found to impact mood and even cause depression. If your child has calmed down it is likely due to a lowering of their blood pressure, not addressing of their ADHD.

This has definitely made them disappear and when I don't give it to her for one day she goes back to raging temper tantrums.  I believe that it has helped.  We tried other drugs that are stimulant driven and they did not work.  This has been the only one that has worked.  Her side effect is sleepiness at 5pm and sometimes in school.  She is not on any other meds.

He hardly ever slept more than 6 hours and those were restless and wakeful. His pulmonary (sleep medicine) Dr prescribed Tenex 1/2 tab at night and from the very first pill he slept a full 12 hours and woke up a brand new kid! I'd read how the drug impacted some children so I was SCARED but it has been nothing but bliss from the very first tablet. He's more agreeable. Listens well. Can sit with a task for more than two minutes. He's still has his sense of humor and still protests like a normal 4 year old. The deliberate defiance and rage is gone. Also, he can walk! Who knew? He had two speeds. Standing still and running. Best decision I made for us. After three years of this nightmare. I finally feel like we've got our life back.
3$Condition: Other$1/13/2015 7:50:32 AM$Reviewer: WorriedMomInMA, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month$4$3$5$My 4 year old son started this medication about  5 days ago. He has had trouble dealing with his father leaving and it caused major behavioral problems at school and at home. After doing everything possible to help him and nothing working the doctor suggested we try this. He seems to be responsive to the medication however, he seems to be hallucinating a little and is very out of it at times. I am hoping that this passes. They warned me that it could take a week or so to fully get in his system and for the initial effects to wear off.

He has tried Focalin XR and that made his symptoms worse.  He's been on Tenex 0.5mg in morning and night and it really seems to be helping.  Before this med we were getting reports of hitting at school daily, and since he started this med, he hasn't hit anyone!  Also we haven't had any significant side affects.  My only wish is that it was longer lasting.  By dinner, he is wound up, running and somewhat violent again.

This med made her paranoid and i had to put an extra blanket over her window cause she think someone is watching her. She said there is a man in her closet so I had to put a lock on the closet door. And she absolutley will not sleep with a night light-she has to have her bedroom light on. She screams constantly and runs thru the house like something was after her. She has been off this med for about 2 weeks now. She still screams all the time but at least she sleeps in her own bed now...It takes her about 4-5 hours to fall asleep with or without meletonion. She sees a new psy doctor this month.

He usually takes it for a month or two and when the tics go away he stops until they come back which can be 6 months or longer.  It controls the tics pretty well.  Although it just started causing the back of his head to itch uncontrollable and he even had to stay home from school.

In Use several mos. stated 1/4 mg increase to 1 1/2 mg daily for ADHD and anger.  Grandson no improvement.  Evolved into explosive personality (very loving before).  Takes toys,other objects & throws to hurt other family members.  Knocks lamps, furniture, anything off tables and into floor.  Has to be contained by physically holding him while he screams non-stop, hits you in face, kicks, very agressive.  Hold by force till he can calm down.  We continue to tell phychiatrist he's no better is getting worse.  He now is afraid someone will break in house.  He has no appetite, can't sleep, afraid he is going to hurt someone. I am  under treatment.  Stitches in one leg & surgery on other.  One area he is hitting or kicking the other leg which has open wound he sneaks up on my and throws heavy objects at wound. He is showing serious signs of confusion but now talks a lot of violence.  Only one doctor is area will treat a child this young.  Am desparate to find a second opinion someplace even another state.  He only will drink milk or juice.  We have very hard time getting him to eat.  Struggling to keep him from losing weight.  I would NEVER put a child on this drug ever again. He's in pre-kindergarten and am holding breathe he is not going to be thrown out.  He is very intelligent, articulate but the articulate is regressing and he's now speaking in ""foreign"" tongue.  You look into his little eyes and he appears so lost.  Be careful on use, at first we thought he was going to do well.  We had a week where he was out of meds and we couldn't get through to the pychiatrist.  His personally changed and he was pleasant...back on meds he's totally out of control. He loves to build (blocks) is very smart but if they fall or break apart he becomes wild.  He attacks you, knocks over furniture, throws everything insight.  Suggestions anybody?  Our family needs help!"

Daycare is really pushing the meds on me because my son has to be re-directed constantly and seems to have issues acting on impulse. I have read reviews about this drug and honestly they are about 50/50. Can anyone tell me if this helps with listening and following directions as well as impulse control for 5yr olds?

I took it 10pm and didn't wake until 3pm the next day except to go to the bathroom even after that I was still groggy all day. I was on 6 BP drugs before starting on Tenex so that probably has something to do with it. I am now prsently getting evaluated to get Renal artery nerve ablation at Edward hosp. in Naperville Il. I have never been as sedated as I was with any other drug as Tenex,I hate it.

I was taking 3 benzos ( valium, Klonopin and lorazepam) plus ambien for sleep. I still did not sleep at all plus i was addicted to the medications. When i decided to go off of all narcotics my doctor was reluctant to dc the meds due to my severe PTSD, i sought help froma different doctor. This new doctor prescribed me tenex and told me he used it off label as a blocker of adrenaline to help with the PTSD, i wasnt quite sure how a blood pressure med would help with PTSD but it makes perfect sense, with PTSD we have a fight or flight reaction to situations, horrible nightmare and lack of sleep, the fight or flight syndrome causes an adrenaline rush so the medication blocks that arenaline. I have never slept better than I do now, this drug is a wonder. I have not had 1 side effect, I no longer have to rely on narcotics, i was deemed disabled due to the PTSD and now I am working, enjoying life and functioning. I also have to see a psychologist in conjuction with the medication but it is so wonderful to sleep again.

What a disaster the bot is so constipated he has been in the er 2 times in a week. nothing helps him. I personally do not believe in medicating children and I believe that sometimes doctor's hand out med's like they are candy. Maybe the doctor should have to sit and listen to him cry because his little belly hurts so bad and he is vomitting because he is so plugged up!

He also claimed that his ""hands were out of control"". The doctor and I were in complete agreement, and we pulled him off of it. It was only a 1 mg dose once a day around lunchtime, but once we pulled him off of it the aggression abruptly disappeared as quickly as it had come. We won't be using it again anytime soon... And I hope the FDA periodically reads these reviews, so hopefully they know that this is a possibility with this medicine, at least in young children.."

It has helped her tremendously! It made a difference immediately. She was able to focus better and helped her stop throwing temper tantrums every time she didn't get her own way. She started out taking 1/4 of 1mg tablet and is now taking 1 1mg tablet at bedtime. I am a mother of 3 children; 2 w/ADHD and 1 w/ADD and all took ritalin to begin with and are now on Concerta. Their doctor monitored their weight, height and blood pressure to make sure they were where they should be for their age. We make sure our children eat before taking the medication so there is a minimal loss of appetite. We have also taught them that medication isn't the answer for everything and not to go through life thinking a pill is going to solve their problems! Parents, be cautious and research everything. Talk to your doctor before you give your children anything! When my children started a new medication or dosage change-I did it on the weekend so I could monitor if there were any side effects! And never ever, give your child more than what the physician has prescribed! If your child seems spaced out-call your doctor immediately! The dosage may need to be adjusted or changed or stopped altogether! People think kids who take medication act like they are drugged or spaced out. People don't know my children take medication unless I tell them and most of the time, they don't believe me! Medication doesn't work for everyone, but it has worked for mine.

53$Condition: Other$4/1/2009 6:38:37 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $4$4$3$My 14 month old son was started on Tenex to help control his tics due to mild Tourettes. We have noticed a severe drop in the amount of tics he has had in just the last 6 days he has been on it. I was not aware of how rapidly this helps.

She also has mild tourettes. It has helped her performance in school amazingly, but has had little effect on her tics. It also helps her outside of class, in social situations homework, etc. She takes 1mg, and has fluctuated between 1 and 1 1/2, but the 1 1/2 makes her tired. If she is forseeing problems, she takes 1 1/4 for a few days. Definitely worth a try!
55$Condition: Other$12/11/2008 2:45:20 PM$Reviewer: HannahzMom, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $4$5$5$"My 9-yr old daughter has Early-Onset Bipolar Disorder with comorbid ADHD. We have been through MANY medications in the last 6 years.  She is on Seroquel and when the Tenex was added, we noticed a significant reduction in the anxiety and it seems to have slowed the ""super-rapid-cycling"" she goes through. SHE is actually happier about the way she feels."
56$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/19/2008 6:48:41 PM$Reviewer: 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$3$my 5 y/o son has been taking tenex in combination with ritalin LA for 3 months. the ritalin alone had no effect, however when we added the tenex (0.5 mg in the morning) he began to excell in school , at home, and behave elsewhere. i have little to no behavior problems and my son is much happier. he is able to make friends as his adhd was so severe that other children avoided him. this has also helped him sit still, listen, and be aware enough to know what's going on around him. The only side affect we noticed in the beginning was loss of appetite. THIS IS NOT A WONDER DRUG! WE ALSO PROVIDED MY SON WITH RULES, SRTUCTURE, AND BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS THERAPY!

She has Tourette's Syndrome, ADHD, and OCD.  We have had no side effects .. Just less tics. It has been an inexpensive medication with great results.
58$Condition: Other$8/9/2008 11:17:26 AM$Reviewer: $4$4$5$My 7 yr ofd son is described as ADHD ODD and Mood Disorder NOS.  After trying many other things, this is the best result for us so far.  He did get very drowsy in the beginning.  We backed down and only use 3/4 mg 3times/day and made increases very gradually.

Just received a OCD Autistic patient who got this medication for anxiety and worked just the oposite. Patient quite anxious, tachicardic and ended up admitted to address his side effects. 
May be good as antihypertensive but the effects on this particular mood affected patient were the opposite as the intended treatment and quite dramatic."

It has not been tested on them.  I have seen my patient get sleepy, drowsy, fall asleep standing up, et. on this drug.  The FDA has no business approving an antihypertensive drug to 12 year olds.  ***STAY AWAY PARENTS***
