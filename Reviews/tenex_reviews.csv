0$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/26/2017 12:14:35 AM$Reviewer:  Female  (Caregiver) $1$1$1$I just wanted to say this as a warning to parents out there. This drug has not been tested and approved by the FDA for treatment of ADHD. It actually has only been approved to treat high blood pressure. Similarly, it has not been found to be helpful in treating ADHD in children under 12 or even safe. The use of this drug is not recommended for children under age 12. I understand that it is often prescribed, but you should be aware that many doctors do not know that this drug has not been tested on children and is not approved to be given to them. Studies have been done on children over age 13 and have shown a marginal impact on ADHD behaviors. High Blood Pressure medicines have been found to impact mood and even cause depression. If your child has calmed down it is likely due to a lowering of their blood pressure, not addressing of their ADHD.

This has definitely made them disappear and when I don't give it to her for one day she goes back to raging temper tantrums.  I believe that it has helped.  We tried other drugs that are stimulant driven and they did not work.  This has been the only one that has worked.  Her side effect is sleepiness at 5pm and sometimes in school.  She is not on any other meds.

He hardly ever slept more than 6 hours and those were restless and wakeful. His pulmonary (sleep medicine) Dr prescribed Tenex 1/2 tab at night and from the very first pill he slept a full 12 hours and woke up a brand new kid! I'd read how the drug impacted some children so I was SCARED but it has been nothing but bliss from the very first tablet. He's more agreeable. Listens well. Can sit with a task for more than two minutes. He's still has his sense of humor and still protests like a normal 4 year old. The deliberate defiance and rage is gone. Also, he can walk! Who knew? He had two speeds. Standing still and running. Best decision I made for us. After three years of this nightmare. I finally feel like we've got our life back.

He has tried Focalin XR and that made his symptoms worse.  He's been on Tenex 0.5mg in morning and night and it really seems to be helping.  Before this med we were getting reports of hitting at school daily, and since he started this med, he hasn't hit anyone!  Also we haven't had any significant side affects.  My only wish is that it was longer lasting.  By dinner, he is wound up, running and somewhat violent again.

He takes this twice a day in conjunction with Strattera. We have seen a huge difference in his attitude, behavior and outbursts. Def worth trying esp if stimulants have failed as they did with our son.

She has been on Tenex for a little over a week.WOW! Such a great difference!. She went from having 4~ 20 minute meltdowns everyday to mabey 3 small ones since she has started taking it...We have a pharmacy in town that made a special compound liquid form so all we have to do is put it her juice twice a day!

We give my 7 year old 1MG at 7pm before bed & at 8:30 we hit the danger zone, as we call it for explosions.  We also have a 3 1/2 year old that has to witness these explosions at times.  The drug has not worked well for us & we are considering substituting it for Strattera.

9$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/10/2013 12:31:20 PM$Reviewer: ResearchMom30, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $3$1$5$My 5 year old daughter was taking this med for about 2 or 3 weeks to help keep her calm because she has rages thru out the day. This med made her paranoid and i had to put an extra blanket over her window cause she think someone is watching her. She said there is a man in her closet so I had to put a lock on the closet door. And she absolutley will not sleep with a night light-she has to have her bedroom light on. She screams constantly and runs thru the house like something was after her. She has been off this med for about 2 weeks now. She still screams all the time but at least she sleeps in her own bed now...It takes her about 4-5 hours to fall asleep with or without meletonion. She sees a new psy doctor this month.

In Use several mos. stated 1/4 mg increase to 1 1/2 mg daily for ADHD and anger.  Grandson no improvement.  Evolved into explosive personality (very loving before).  Takes toys,other objects & throws to hurt other family members.  Knocks lamps, furniture, anything off tables and into floor.  Has to be contained by physically holding him while he screams non-stop, hits you in face, kicks, very agressive.  Hold by force till he can calm down.  We continue to tell phychiatrist he's no better is getting worse.  He now is afraid someone will break in house.  He has no appetite, can't sleep, afraid he is going to hurt someone. I am  under treatment.  Stitches in one leg & surgery on other.  One area he is hitting or kicking the other leg which has open wound he sneaks up on my and throws heavy objects at wound. He is showing serious signs of confusion but now talks a lot of violence.  Only one doctor is area will treat a child this young.  Am desparate to find a second opinion someplace even another state.  He only will drink milk or juice.  We have very hard time getting him to eat.  Struggling to keep him from losing weight.  I would NEVER put a child on this drug ever again. He's in pre-kindergarten and am holding breathe he is not going to be thrown out.  He is very intelligent, articulate but the articulate is regressing and he's now speaking in ""foreign"" tongue.  You look into his little eyes and he appears so lost.  Be careful on use, at first we thought he was going to do well.  We had a week where he was out of meds and we couldn't get through to the pychiatrist.  His personally changed and he was pleasant...back on meds he's totally out of control. He loves to build (blocks) is very smart but if they fall or break apart he becomes wild.  He attacks you, knocks over furniture, throws everything insight.  Suggestions anybody?  Our family needs help!"
14$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/2/2012 10:21:38 AM$Reviewer: 3-6 Male  (Caregiver) $1$1$1$My son will be 5yrs old in 2 months. His Dr has prescribed Tenex and told me to give him 1/4 a tablet to start out. Daycare is really pushing the meds on me because my son has to be re-directed constantly and seems to have issues acting on impulse. I have read reviews about this drug and honestly they are about 50/50. Can anyone tell me if this helps with listening and following directions as well as impulse control for 5yr olds? I am torn, I dont want to give my son meds, but I want him to be happy and do good in school and daycare as well as home. PLEASE HELP!!!

In addition, I itched frequently and had unmanagable constipation.  Had I not had the side effects, I would have considered continuing use. Please note that I take a tremendous amount of other RX's - perhaps made a difference re:  side effects.  ??

If she isn't asleep she's crying. And screaming for hours.

19$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/9/2011 8:56:33 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $2$1$5$I filled this out for my grandson who is 3 years old. What a disaster the bot is so constipated he has been in the er 2 times in a week. nothing helps him. I personally do not believe in medicating children and I believe that sometimes doctor's hand out med's like they are candy. Maybe the doctor should have to sit and listen to him cry because his little belly hurts so bad and he is vomitting because he is so plugged up!

He also claimed that his ""hands were out of control"". The doctor and I were in complete agreement, and we pulled him off of it. It was only a 1 mg dose once a day around lunchtime, but once we pulled him off of it the aggression abruptly disappeared as quickly as it had come. We won't be using it again anytime soon... And I hope the FDA periodically reads these reviews, so hopefully they know that this is a possibility with this medicine, at least in young children.."

Hardest part is not knowing which disorder is acting up to judge which meds are working or not.  I like the fact it's a non-stimulant & used for anxiety/mood stabilizing along w/ADHD.

He was on it for three days and I was already seeing positive effects.  I was happy.  However, on the 4th day, he told me he had a pain in his chest and that he'd had it since the day before.  We needed to discontinue this medication and try somethign else.  I was sorry about that, since I thought it was working so well and I liked that it was not a stimulant.

27$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/12/2010 11:27:12 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$My 18 yr old daughter, our youngest, has been taking this drug along with Concerta for over 10 years. It has helped her tremendously! It made a difference immediately. She was able to focus better and helped her stop throwing temper tantrums every time she didn't get her own way. She started out taking 1/4 of 1mg tablet and is now taking 1 1mg tablet at bedtime. I am a mother of 3 children; 2 w/ADHD and 1 w/ADD and all took ritalin to begin with and are now on Concerta. Their doctor monitored their weight, height and blood pressure to make sure they were where they should be for their age. We make sure our children eat before taking the medication so there is a minimal loss of appetite. We have also taught them that medication isn't the answer for everything and not to go through life thinking a pill is going to solve their problems! Parents, be cautious and research everything. Talk to your doctor before you give your children anything! When my children started a new medication or dosage change-I did it on the weekend so I could monitor if there were any side effects! And never ever, give your child more than what the physician has prescribed! If your child seems spaced out-call your doctor immediately! The dosage may need to be adjusted or changed or stopped altogether! People think kids who take medication act like they are drugged or spaced out. People don't know my children take medication unless I tell them and most of the time, they don't believe me! Medication doesn't work for everyone, but it has worked for mine.

It also helps her outside of class, in social situations homework, etc. She takes 1mg, and has fluctuated between 1 and 1 1/2, but the 1 1/2 makes her tired.
