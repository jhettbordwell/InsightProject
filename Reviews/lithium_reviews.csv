0$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/6/2016 6:38:55 AM$Reviewer: China blue, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I can honestly say I would not be alive today without Lithium.  I had tried so many meds that didn't work I was considering electroshock therapy.  I had tried to commit suicide 3 times.  After three days of taking Lithium it was as if I felt a switch turn on in my brain.  The depression and endless crying stopped.  I'm not saying I don't have days when I struggle.  I have plenty.  But since taking this drug I have never once had the urge to hurt myself.  Attempting suicide feels foreign to me now.  I'm not saying Lithium works for everyone.  We all react differently to meds.  But if you are desperate it might be worth asking your doctor about it.

Don't take it.  Now I have to take a daily pill for my thyroid.  Lithium is in batteries and is poisonous
2$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/18/2013 1:21:36 AM$Reviewer: Rev Jim, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on Li for a long time and I don't think i will be here without it.  I have tried other medications and nothing has helped.  I take 1800mg of the liquid and I will say if i could take more I would but the doc can't give me anymore.  It is a wonder drug for me but a poison for others.  Try other drugs first but if it works why monkey with it.

Lithium works for me. Patience is very important. Watch the your weight while taking this and guys you may want to ask your doctor for a ""booster"" , taking lithium. it has helped."

Water would probably be a better mood-stabilizer than this slightly toxic non-natural piece of metal that they sell as 'the' bipolar medication.
