1$Condition: Other$10/28/2015 5:32:03 PM$Reviewer: LA, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$I have been prescribed this twice for pain. Once for pleurisy pain and now for kidney stones. Supposed to take one every 6 hours. It takes 2 hours for Tramadol to begin easing pain SLIGHTLY, then it only works for about 2 hours. Thus I suffer for the last two hours before time to take next dose. doc said to take with Extra Strength Tylenol to increase pain relief effectiveness. Pitiful excuse for pain reliever but doc won't give me anything stronger despite being his patient for 11 years. Time to shop for new doctor.

I have had no issues with interactions or side effects.  It has worked so well that I thought it was not working, but if I skip just one dose I definitely feel the difference.  It keeps my hand from cramping and curling into claws on heavy days at work.

5$Condition: Other$6/28/2014 11:57:10 AM$Reviewer: bigun77039, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I had Restless Leg Syndrome,lower back pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and some other problems. I've been taking Tramadol for over 9 years now and if I run out of it I will end up in the emergency room. before this 9 year period, I was seeing a psychiatrist regularly and had many hospitalizations for mental problems for over 20 years before I started Tramadol. None of their psychiatric medications worked very well. Since I have been taking Tramadol (9 Years Now)I have not had to see a psychiatrist. There are some bad side effects such as memory loss, slight depression, tiredness, and a few other things, but the benefits greatly outweigh the side effects. I have had to adjust the amounts over the years and now taking two 50MG tabs three times daily. This seems to be the best for me. I believe solving the lower back pains has been the major part of solving my problems.

12$Condition: Other$8/2/2012 3:52:15 PM$Reviewer: pwwpea, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I have used this drug only after very active, physicaly demanding days because I do not like to take pills. One at the end of that day and one the next morning gets me to be able to function fairly easily. I am of the mentallity that if I had no pain, I would deffinitely over do it. This takes most pain away with little to no side affects.
13$Condition: Other$11/5/2011 9:12:33 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$2$This medication has not been useful due to the fact that it has not stopped the pain.  Directions from the doctor states it should be taken by mouth every 6 hours as needed.  Over the counter medications have done just as well.

I can only take this drug at night because it makes me very sleepy.  It does help with my back pain and gives me a restful night but, as mentioned earlier, I can ONLY take it at night.

I started feeling like I was getting panic attacks and shakes.  I cut the dose way back and the panic attacks have stopped. But now I am left with a high amount of pain for my back condition. 
19$Condition: Other$2/3/2011 11:14:26 PM$Reviewer: Menchaca, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$It worked on my nerves before I had pain relief, redirects my brain, but I did have on and off dizzy spells and quick thoughts racings faster than I could speak. Do not drive and make sure you eat well. tends too decrease appetite, and increase thirst with some imbalance.  Yet, very alert. takes at least and hour and one-half for pain to start to minimize. Muscles will relax suddenly to where you may walk and talk as if you are drunk at this point you must  have bed rest to avoid any injury. no other medication is needed and be sure to have any other medication out of your system before starting.

28$Condition: Other$1/31/2009 3:30:18 PM$Reviewer: chronic pain, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I was put on tramadol about a month after surgery on my lower back.  I had been on oxycodone before that.  The oxycodone worked fine but the doctor didn't want me to stay on that.  Thanks to that because the Tramadol was superior.  The Tramadol relieved almost all the pain and still let me maintain function.
