4$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$6/12/2014 1:16:09 PM$Reviewer: craigzworld, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"I have been taking this drug since January of 2013. It calms my headaches and dizziness resulting from a Traumatic Brain Injury. Pamelor also works well with keeping my mood swings in check. I started out at 25 milligrams nightly and then  increased it to 50 milligrams and now I am at 75 milligrams daily. 
The major negatives with this drug is a higher heart rate, hair loss - could be from my age mid 50's, and about a 15% weight gain which is extremely difficult to work its way off."

I was going through a terribly stressful time at work and noticed a HUGE difference in just a few days on 30 mg.  I also began sleeping better than I have in years!  The dry mouth was difficult for me, but worth it.  I also had some constipation, but nothing that some stool softeners couldn't help.  After I got through the worst time I decreased to 20 mg/day, and have settled there nicely.  The dry mouth is no longer a problem and I am still sleeping great and emotionally stable.

Had to go through a whole host of other depression Rx's before finding this one to be effective.  There are side effects: dry mouth; ringing in the ears; weight gain--which has to be attended to; but it is the only Rx that has worked for me.  So the trade off in terms of putting up with the side effects has been worth it. I use Biotene mouthwask to handle the dry mouth--it's effective. I have to watch my diet but my determination does me well.

27$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$8/24/2011 12:29:50 AM$Reviewer: SKNY, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"I am taking this medication for fybromyalgia pain, and for associated sleep problems. Over about a year, I worked up to 40mg a day (taken at night). I've now started to take 50mg a day. Early on, last year, I had dry mouth and was sleepy. Constipation has been an ongoing issue, but is easily addressed with a daily dose of fiber supplements. I think there's been some impact on my weight, but not terrible. The more serious side effect was that at the very beginning, the med made me feel more depressed, sometimes even somewhat suicidal, but I decided to stick it out for a while, and I'm glad I did, because the side-effects subsided after about a 4-6 weeks. The very big upside is that my pain was significantly diminished, and my sleep got much better (I hadn't had a decent night's sleep in 5 years without Ambien, and I do react well to sleeping meds). I still sometimes get headaches from neck pain, but my MD suggested an Ativan (Lorazepam), which I take occasionally, and which usually helps. Over time the Pamelor also had a positive effect on my feelings of depression, and my fibro-related fogginess lifted quite a bit. 

I have had some recent resurgence in pain, so my GP suggested  that extra 10mg a day to go up to 50mg (something my neurologist had recommended many months ago). I started in the past week, and am noticing renewed side-effects--the dry mouth (and bad taste in my mouth) is back, I'm sleeping long, long hours (12-14), and the constipation is worse.  BUT I'm hoping that, since these eventually eased before, they will again. Overall so far, I think Nortiptyline (generic Pamelor) has been a very successful treatment for me. "

Each pill is 10mg cap. At first I took one pill, then my MD asked me to take 2 pills. One pill mostly stopped all the crying and sadness I had, but was not able to fall asleep fast enough. Then, my MD asked me to take 2 pills, I did not do well since I really was not able to sleep at all. Now, my migraine,neck pain and crying are starting again. My MD asked me to take 2 pills again and add Tylenol pM for night time. I am not really sure whats going on. My migraines are active twice a month for at least 4 to 5 days each. For the migraines I use Relpax, but I need this medication constantly within my reach. Overall, I do not feel that Pamelor will help me entirely.

33$Condition: Depression$5/30/2011 10:39:34 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$3$This medication took a couple of weeks to start working. After about 2 weeks I could tell a difference in myself. I was happier and felt less anxious. My family noticed a difference in me too (I wasn't soo gloomy and grouchy anymore.) For the most part I would say Pamelor has helped me. My only issue is that I sometimes forget to take it. I take it once daily at bedtime. If I'm really tired when going to bed, I sometimes forget to take it. I end up missing that dose because I don't want to take it the next morning (because I'm concerned that it might be too close to the next dose.) When I miss 1 or 2 doses, I end up feeling depressed, angry, and anxious all over again. This has just happened to me, so today I set an alarm in my phone to remind me to take it every night. All-in-All, As long as I keep up with it, It gives me great results!

Pamelor- ask your doc for Imipramine! It's the best.It has few of the side effects of the others.I've been on many TCA's, and 
Imipramine leaves Nortriptyline and the others
(like elavil)in the shade! You will not wake
up groggy,it does not cause palpitations,you
will not be dizzy,etc.This is the stuff! It also causes more mood elevation than the others.I wake up every morning downright
euphoric(happy,content)! It works for the same
things pamelor and elevil are used for(except
not the best for sleep-only causes mild drowsiness)Try it.you wont go back.Small
doses are very effective.Difficulty urinating
goes away after awhile.Makes skin pleasantly
tingle-becomes less with time."

I am 16 year old female. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I felt pretty good for about three months with no problems. I was first taking 10mg a day, then upped it to 20mg.I smoked once and had a reaction, but didn't think much of it. I took Excedrin for a headache which has caffeiene and had another reaction. My heartbeat was nearly 200 and could not see straight, dizzy, talking to myself. Rode in ambulance so out of it. They diagnosed me with SVT (heart condition) which was caused with from the Nortiptaline. I quit cold turkey and was completely insane for two weeks. Hearing voices in my head, wanting to die, extremely sleepy, did nothing by lay in my bed.I am still suicidal and it has nearly been a month. I'm surprised I have made it through everything. I prayed every night for God to just keep me alive through all the pain and suffering. I know have extreme anxiety(chest pain, cannot see clearly, feel like I can't breath, very snappy with people) and before taking Pamelor I was a pretty happy person. I told myself I would never take drugs again, but am now surrendering to Zoloft. I can't live like this.

I've had RA for 19 years, depression for 19 years, menopause going on 5 years and fatigue since I can't remember when.  I have been on every medication possible for above issues.  After reading these reviews, I thought I would give Pamelor another try.  I only took it for about a week and got so frustrated because I did not experience any positive results. Actually, NO RESULTS at all. I guess that is the ""mania/anger feelings"" that come along with depression.  Thanks to all of you who took time out to write a review whether positive or negative.  It made me feel I need to give Pamelor time to adjust to my body.  Since, the doctor has prescribed adderall which has relieved only the fatigue issues.  Wish I could find something that would help with at least one more of my ailments.  If anyone has any ideas, please please please advise.

It took about 2-3 weeks to work, but I haven't had a headache in 8 days now!  I am definitely pleased with this aspect. The only side effect I've experienced that I don't like is constipation, but I have IBS with constipation anyway.  I take Metamucil, stool softener, eat prunes and apples to combat that.  I do sleep longer and feel just a tad sluggish in the morning but it dissipates quickly enough.  I dream a lot, though, not bad dreams, just busy. I wake frequently but have no trouble falling back asleep.  I am menopausal, too, so part of my sleep disruption is due to that.  Overall I'm happy with Pamelor.

When I changed neurologist I had to do a stress test for the heart because the two meds together caused heart flutters. So I was taken off the pamelor then all H… broke loose. I became depressed and developed IBS and my migraines came more often and more painful. I was in a downward spiral for two years. My life is getting back to normal but I am not happy about post pamelor conditions.  I now take prozac which helped ease up the post symptoms.

Pain level in butt & legs up to an 8 of 10 at times,sitting was excruciating and I couldn't even stand the bedsheet to touch my left leg/foot. I had a level of 5-6 often.

At first on this drug, had heart palpitations, crazy non-stop dreaming except to jerk awake, diarrhea, nausea, eye twitches. started at 10mg a day. Side affects x 4weeks, now none! I've been on it 8 months and it doesn't even really make me sleepy (bummer). Now taking 30mg a day two pills in pm, one in am.

On pain-free days I think drug is great.  On bad days,not so great! But bad days now around level 4-5 w/lots of 0-2 days now. I keep up exercise, home physical therapy, ice, stretching, & rest & steroid shots though, it's a multi-pronged approach.

I advise to titrate up really slowly,less of a shock that way. I'm trying to avoid having to take narcotics, and trying to avoid Neurontin; afraid I'll want to stab somebody with a salad fork on that stuff after reading it's reviews. (But,local pharmacist says Neurontin mostly just makes you sleepy and someday I may have no choice) Right now,this is helping some, not interfering with my life and I can still titrate up to 50mg a day if needed.

Good luck to all of us nerve pain sufferers-many of us look & try to act quite normal, but spend a lot of time in misery."

For this I took another prescription drug. However after my doctor added another med, it resulted in nearly 100% reduction of migraines. I have not had a ""real"" migraine since I don't know when!
I sometimes have drowsiness when awaking in the morning on occasions. Sometimes I go through weak periods where sitting becomes a necessity, and standing is not an option. Because I feel that I will collapse otherwise.
Over all I have had great success with this med, and it seems like the weight problem stopped when I went on the second med.  
I write this positive report because all of the reports I read were negative. Of course my problem may not have been as severe as those whose woes I read.
I've been to the well known migraine clinic North of Chicago, to a doctor in Elkhart, IN (whom I heard had success with migraines), then to this neurologist. "
