1$Condition: Schizophrenia$9/18/2012 2:14:32 PM$Reviewer: kaeksen, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"It has worked 100% in my case. I got back to the one i was prior to my schizophrenic start in the early 90's. Lost 18 of my years, but now im happy :)
In my case i had several voices in my head, either helping me, or wanting to be cruel, or other mal adjusted types of conscious behavior. It was like my connections in my head was not connected as for memory concerned, i had big trouble remembering things. Sometimes hard forming sentences (at the end before i finally gave in to drug treatment, as i realized now its time to try something new.)And i dont regret it at all, it was the start of a new life, with the connections in my brain finally working again as they should.
I would recommend others that have trouble with schizophrenia to try this drug. Dont start of with a big dose 20mg, but start with 7.5mg for a week, then if it doesnt work as good as wanted, try 10mg for another week. For me 10mg was enough, but i realize that i might in the future higher the dose. I've been on 10mg for 2 mnths now, and the 10mg keeps working 95%. I sure hope that i dont have to increase the dossage very much in the future, as i hope it will stablelize atleast with a 15mg dossage.
Its very individual how effective the medisine is, from people to people.
In my case i had far too much production of dopamine, and serotonine (neurotransmitters)
So the meds are ""hindering"" the reseptors to use much of the D&S which i produce, and it gives me calm, and makes my brain/mind whole.
I hope i have contributed some. Sorry 4 my bad english. Take care all. :)"

Not sure if we will continue.
3$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$2/18/2012 7:08:38 PM$Reviewer: hotstuff, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Zydis is a kind of wonder drug for me.  I have experienced the weight gain and seemingly insatiable appetite. I don't think there are many skinny people on psychiatric drugs, but that is just my personal observation. For those who don't gain, wonderful!  I wish I was among that elite group.  It is a supplement to my usual dosage of Zyprexa and taken as/if needed only. Good luck to others who try it.

10$Condition: Other$6/1/2009 5:04:07 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$2$4$I gained an incredible amount of weight.  I did sleep better and the mania of my anxiety went away.  Upon discontinuance, however, I rapidly lost weight, which caused some other health problems.  In the long run I'm not sure if there was a better route to take.  I will weigh options more closely if anxiety returns to that degree
11$Condition: Schizophrenia$4/13/2009 10:34:03 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$3$5$Well to tell you the truth it worked for about the first few months and then afterwards the effects wore off. but i still got the sideeffects that cae with it when it stopped working. uncontrolable hunger (mostly for sweets) snd sleeping alot. over all my experience was not good but it may be different for you.
12$Condition: Other$4/9/2009 9:05:54 AM$Reviewer: Serena, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month$3$2$1$"I did not take this medication long enough to get full use of of it, but when I did use it I felt very tired the next morning wanting to sleep in until at least noon even though I took it the night before. So it makes you really tired and my hunger was uncontrollable. I felt like I couldn't stop eating for some reason. My husband did notice that I seemed ""at ease"" he said that things didn't seem to bother me as much, which was good for the family lol. I did feel less stressed/anxious but it wasn't worth the side effects for me."

When starting Zyprexa, I first started sleeping like most people instead of the terrible insomnia I used to have, and without a hangover.  Also, I immediately noticed my racing mind slowing down and thinking became much more controlled.

Interestingly I stopped having bruxism.  I initially gained weight, but that got under control now by avoiding carbs where possible.  My mind is not racing with random or ruminating thoughts.  I still would have some depression, but less frequently, and that was brought under control with 300 mg lithium added.  I don't feel suicidal or, at the other extreme, do foolish things associated with mania.  I now look back on my life as a manic person almost out of control and know that that won't happen anymore.

Also, Eli Lilly has made this drug available to me at no charge since I have little income.  How wonderful all this is!"
16$Condition: Other$7/17/2008 7:53:46 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$The efficacy of the medication has been wonderful in treating the delusions, hallucinations and irrational thoughts.  I do not experience any systems with the use of this medication in combination with Risperdal in low doseage.  I have gained weight and am upset with this side effect. I sleep well at night because of the Zyprexa but the sedative nature of the medication is too strong and makes me sleep too long.
