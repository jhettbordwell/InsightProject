2$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$8/18/2014 6:30:45 PM$Reviewer: fire godess, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$5$"Have been on this medication for about 20 yrs. now. It worked on day one for me - noticed an immediate change. For that reason, I've never considered changing. I did experience weight gain (which for females is kind of depressing on it's own). I definately experienced loss of libido and that's been disturbing to me. It is for these reasons that I'm considering changing to another anti-depressant. But this will work!
