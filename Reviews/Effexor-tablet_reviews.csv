per day because of a serious heath issue that had me in a coma for about a week and a half. After recovery my doctor tried Effexor as a replacement. The medicine was so bad, I was seriously considering suicide daily and found myself actually looking for trees along the highway which would do the job. I was an avid duck hunter and one day across a pond was a tree. The tree began to move and come toward me across the pond. I immediately went to my doctor who weaned me off of the med. 
it took approximately 10-11 months to get off the medicine and get the suicidal thoughts out of my head. I was abusive to my family, which led to a divorce. My career was horribly affected and I lost many friends because of my ups and downs trying to get off of it. It was the worst experience of my life. I’ve heard nothing but horror stories about this medication. Please research it before you try it

I had been on the birth control pill up to the day of my heart attack and that had kept most of the hot flashes away. As soon as I went off the birth control pill, hot flashes hit. Very bad and about 15 per day. Doctor suggested Effexor 37.5mg once a day since I can not take hormones because of heart disease. It took a while (6 weeks) to start working but once it did it was a sure fix for me. Hot flashes happen about 3 times a week now! Decided to come off of it after about 6 months and hot flashes have returned. :(  The worst part however is the withdrawal symptoms. Even at that low dose, coming off has given me a week's worth of dizziness when I move my head. My eyes don't seem to be processing what they see in real time and that makes me dizzy. Also have something I will just reference as the ""brain zaps"" mentioned by others just because I can not describe it. But helping with the hot flashes and mood swings was definitely worth going through the withdrawal ! "
4$Condition: Depression$12/10/2019 5:15:18 AM$Reviewer: nncoffee, 65-74 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$I took Effexor for 6 months and it changed my personality.  The longer I was on Effexor the worse the side effects got.  On Effexor I started having insomnia that became so bad that I was lucky to get 2 hours of sleep a night.  I became so irritable and impatient that I started having almost uncontrollable fits of anger and cussing when I was alone in my car.  I also started cussing when I made a minor mistake.  Before I started taking Effexor I DIDNÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â ;?T cuss.  On Effexor I also became significantly more anxious and started experiencing compulsive behaviors that I had NEVER experienced prior to taking Effexor. I stopped taking Effexor a year ago, and I am still experiencing all of these negative changes in my personality except insomnia,  Once again, I want to emphasize that I NEVER had any of these issues before I took Effexor.

Im taking 300mg. 2 x 150mg tablets in the morning. I take both together as when I use to take one in the morning and one at night I had terrible trouble sleeping. Taking them both in the morning worked for me. However, I am now finding by 3pm in the afternoon I am getting withdrawal like symptoms. The brain zapping and dizziness. I havenâ??t spoken to my doctor yet as I donâ??t want to increase them any more. I would love to try and come off them. But I am so frightened of the withdrawal symptoms and feeling so bad the depression returns. When you have come off them how did they advise you to decrease? I will go to see my doctor and take his advice but to know someone that has done and techniques on how to cope with the withdrawal would be good. I feel like locking myself away for sometime and coming off them so I am alone and canâ??t take the feelings out on anyone else. Or could the doctor just put me in a induced coma and take me off the drugs? I could wake up and itâ??s all gone out of my system! I am joking on the last bit I donâ??t any doctor would do that.

Iâ??m 18 and have had anxiety/depression for most of my life. I have tried Paxil, Lexapro, and Zoloft but this one has worked the best. The only thing I donâ??t like about it is that if you miss a pill or are trying to get off of the drug, the side effects are horrible. When I miss a pill, the next day I am super sad, confused, dizzy, I canâ??t concentrate on anything, Iâ??m super tired, and very loopy. If you are wanting to take this medication, just know that the side effects of withdrawal are very hard, but the pill works very good in my case. I didnâ??t have any side effects getting on the pill so that was also a plus. Read reviews, but donâ??t expect to have the same circumstance as everyone who takes it because it reacts differently with everyone.

Effexor worked for my anxiety, although it took away a sense of ""urgency"" related to task importance, and sex drive disappeared.  I weaned off under my doctor's supervision, replacing the Effexor with Cipralex gradually.  I am experiencing paralyzing brain malfunction, confusion, randomly losing where I am and where I'm going while driving.  Getting lost travelling routes that I'm familiar with.

VERY NICE SURPRISE! I'm waking up pain free for the first time in 15 years. The pain comes in later, but it's so very nice that it's not what wakes me anymore.Ive just begun treatment w Effexor and I can only hope this 'side effect' is lasting. I'm taking 37.5 mg. For the first time in decades I have hope. And, yes, it completely handled my depression symptoms, too. I get a black wave of depression every few days, but am no longer a jug of tears.

My Dr. put me on Effexor with no warnings about side effects. Took 150mgs for about a year along with Zoloft and I began to feel like my old self again, before depression. You know that person you wish you could be again. And my only complaint is the horrible sweating. But it's worth it to me. Just be careful when coming off because I didnt know if it was the drug or me Just feeling better so I stopped taking it overnight and it threw me through a loop. My depression came back full force and I started crying to myself and thinking I was crazy and better off dead. Still, I stayed off of it for 2 or 3 months untill it got oit of my system. I didn't sweat nearly as much but now I am realizing that I was better off on the effexor than off and have recently started to take it again. I just hope I have the same good effects as the first time around.

A very rushed dr in psych prescribed me Effexor. I knew right away this medication and I werenâ??t going to get along, but everyone encouraged us to try and work it out. Played with dosage, but I only lasted a little over a month on it. Ya know in drug commercials where they list all the possible side effects? That was our relationship. This medication may cause â??dry moth, constipation, headaches..â?. Perfect for anyone that loves having anxiety attacks in coffee shops and feeling out of body

The only side effects I have now remains the dry mouth, waking up at 2am,3am,4am etc until I have to get up, unable to orgasm (I'm female) and I'm unable to cry physically even if I feel sad. I think you need to have expectations of this drug it's not going to make you ""happy"" and ""energetic"" it's going to make you function normally. I can make decisions at work again, communicate better with others, I don't excessively worry about things in fact it makes you literally not care. It blunts your emotions which is a good thing and a bad thing. But it has definetly helped to balance things out for me and improved my quality of life. The side effects are worth it. You know its working when you nearly forget to take it in the morning. It's like having a sore throat, you're very aware of the pain so you take a paracetamol, once this drug starts working you feel so normal again youre not aware of the pain that was once there all the time.

...until I got home. Work was an escape from myself for me. If I had no weekend functions to attend I would be catatonic, only getting out of bed to use the bathroom.
I had always felt like an outsider, looking in on life, trying to imitate what everyone else was doing, but never getting it quite right and others sensing that I was a fake.
No not suicidal-many years ago I came to the realization that I can only live once for a limited amount of time, but death is forever. Also, as long as I was alive, I always had a choice, but once I was dead, there was no coming back.
About 6 years ago, it was so bad that I stopped sleeping and could not eat, dropping 40 pounds in a matter of weeks. My thoughts were chasing around in my head so much, that I thought I would jump out of the window any second just to make it stop.  Decided to get help. Diagnosed with menopause related depression. Put on Effexor, 75mg. Took about 2 weeks to get used to it. Yes, head in a fog. Eventually things normalized and dosage did not have to be increased.  I was supposed to be on it for about a year, to allow my body time to get used to the changes. After having left the med at work over a long holiday weekend in October, I suffered extreme withdrawal symptoms and decided to stop taking it right then and there. I also found out that it made my cholesterol go from 180 to 260. Which still has not normalized. I was able to get it down in the 230s adding phytosterols, nuts, healthy oils and seaweed. 
Apparently I am in the 8% percent that this happens to when taking Effexor. Unfortunately, this was not in the patient information leaflet. I always read those completely. But the prescribing physician should have seen that in the desk reference and monitored for it. Good thing: was only on it 6 mos."

I have felt a tiny bit better mood wise but the side effects are horrible and not worth it. I wake up 3-4 times a night absolutely drenched in sweat, my bedding is soaked, but I am freezing cold. I feel like I only get about 2 hours sleep with all the waking up and uncomfortableness of sweating. When I do sleep I have terrible nightmares. This is getting worse not better.
I have trouble with body temperature during the day too - I get really hot and feel like I will pass out. Or really cold and just can't get warm for several hours.
I also have terrible nausea that is getting worse, some days it's pretty much constant. 
Other side effects include constipation, headaches, blurred vision and loss of appetite. At the start I also bruised really easily and was pretty much covered in bruises for a few weeks.
Side effects are so awful I am trying to get off this drug, and even after only 3 months, it is proving difficult. I am back down to 75 mg but the side effects are getting worse. I am living on anti-nausea pills!"

Also, my blood pressure has been consistently high since I started this medication  ( 175/89 to over 210/99).

My Dr. didn't advise me of the significant side effects, including flu-like symptoms if you miss as little as one or two doses.  You can feel seriously ill.  I took it for years, and experienced this pretty much every time I forgot a dose.  When I went to a doctor (a different one than the one who prescribed it, since I lost trust in her due to her failure to inform me about the downsides of Effexor) to get off this Rx, I asked her what the worse case scenario would be if I was traveling in a remote area and the Rx was lost/stolen, as I was planning a trip in Africa.  She said I'd be hospitalized.  It took SIX WEEKS to slowly reduce the dosage and gradually get off this Rx.  I needed the doctor's supervision to do it safely.  I would caution anyone considering taking it to research it thoroughly in advance.  If there are other effective options, I would certainly recommend those instead of Effexor, and consider it a drug of last resort.

I would get the ""brain zaps"" everyone on here is talking about and I would instantly feel more depressed, more likely to have an anxiety attack or to have severe mood swings. I am now trying to come off it and taking 150 mgs a day. I really want to stop taking this drug since I feel like the side effects cause more harm than it's benefits for me.

27$Condition: Depression$6/14/2016 8:03:01 AM$Reviewer: Timofbedlam, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$3$2$"By far the most effective antidepressant I have used, but also with the worst side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
I was prescribed Venlafaxine (aka Effexor) after showing limited response to fluoxetine and trazodone (had previously tried amitriptyline, Seroxat, and dusolepin). Venlafaxine alleviated the worst of my depression and anxiety, and allowed me to start consistently getting more than 2 hours sleep per night, for the first time in months. The doctor gradually raised the dose, and I started getting more sleep and feeling less out of control.
The side effects were unpleasant, but still preferable to depression. My mouth and throat were so dry each morning that I had to down a pint or two of water when I awoke, but just swallowing water was painful on such a parched throat. My sex drive diminished drastically. I was constipated. I sweated excessively, especially at night. Cuts and bruises took many times longer than usual to heal. My dreams were very vivid. After a few months, I developed pain and stiffness in the tendons of my fingers and the backs of my hands, and frequent pain in my shoulder joints: writing, typing and playing guitar all became difficult, but it took me a while to make the connection that the medication was causing me to develop tendonitis.
I weaned myself off as quickly as possible, eventually quitting altogether to avoid the side effects. Withdrawal symptoms included weird electrical twinges in my brain, irritability, severe headaches, severely impaired concentration, and insomnia. I have stayed off it ever since, and the tendonitis cleared up. I don't regret taking Venlafaxine, but wish I had insisted on a lower dose and/or stopped taking it earlier. My emotions were numbed and I'm not sure that they've ever recovered to the pre-Venlafaxine levels, even now several years after quitting.
A useful drug for severe depression when nothing else works, but approach with caution and don't take more than absolutely necessary."

I couldn't have coped with all my life difficulties without it (being a single parent, hyperactive kid, etc.).

Another side effect is reduced libido, but I still have plenty of libido. You could say I'm ""addicted"" because if I don't take Effexor everyday, I start to feel very depressed and even physically sick, nauseous, headache.

However in the last year, Zoloft has started to fail me, and after messing around with the dose for a while, my psych switched me to 75mg of Effexor. I noticed nothing for the first month, so he bumped it to 150mg.

This is where a lot of things changed. I didn't see much of a difference in side effects, however anti-depressants usually make me sweat a lot and give me sticky hands. Nothing major. It did have a great effect on both my mood and my motivation. In the last few months, I have had a horrible time with school, namely with writing. I'm a good writer and I typically receive A's and B's on assignments, however writing became much more difficult for me once Zoloft stopped working. I tended to completely avoid major assignments because they were too overwhelming. I couldn't even look at the assignment pages without becoming extremely anxious. Most of the time I simply procrastinated through the deadline because the stress of  receiving a failing grade was worse than looking at, brainstorming, and drafting an essay. It was pretty bad for me. I couldn't even study for my easier classes either. 

So, about 4-6 weeks after switching to the 150mg dose of Effexor, I noticed that writing became easier. Suddenly it didn't give me a panic attack to create an outline for a research essay. I was actually able to study for hours for my finals as well. For my final essay in one course, I procrastinated until the day that it was due (however this time it was because I spent my time studying, not moping around all depressed and anxious). Instead of panicking that I had no time to do it and feeling overwhelmed, I actually seriously sat down and spent all day researching and writing, and I finished it and got an A. 

So I became functioning again, and deadlines motivated me rather than made me freeze up. So I'm pretty satisfied so far."

This drug has side effects like sweating which I get and that's one of the reasons I want to get off of it.

For 2 months I have been feeling great except constipation, pain in my arms and just generalized fear of being on this medication so I decided against medical advise to stop taking it. It has been 1 whole week with some lightheadness, but that's ALL. I did need that time I was on the medication to pull myself out of that dark place and I think it worked. I can drive, go to the mall/grocery store and even work and have had no problems for the last 3 weeks and no withdrawals the last week. Don't be afraid to try the med. I'm glad I did

Initially it worked well; however, since my successful transition to a new job the source of my anxiety is now gone and I am left with side affects of the drug, primarily the lack of interest in any social activities, hobbies, and sexual activity to include ED and the lack of sexual satisfaction. I intend to speak to my doctor today about weaning off the drug. My biggest concern is that I do not experience the horrible withdraw symptoms identified in many of the reviews listed here. In my case, it was effective for the short-term (18 months) anxiety I experienced; however, it is not something I would want to be on long term.

I no longer play the ""100 different ways to off myself"" throughout the day.  My mind doesn't feel cloudy like it did on Lexapro, though the Lex had some euphoric yawns.  Greatest of all, I can no longer experience/feel the emotion of sadness.  Not for a couple of months now.  It's gone.  Completely.  Songs and stuff that once set me off now do nothing.  My mind just filters it all out and I just tend to yawn during times when I once got sad.  It's  like I am always happy or numb, but I can't fall below the numb area.  Also, it has seemed to curb my appetite and my weight is finally stabilizing to where it should be.  Only negatives that I have found were the onset of headaches and such while starting the treatment, along with some random twitches, nervousness, restlessness, and the occasional panic attack.  

All-in-all, it works for me.  Might not for everybody else, but it's better than thinking about killing yourself all of the time.  "

48$Condition: Depression$6/2/2014 7:09:26 AM$Reviewer: overcomer1, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Effexor has worked for me every time. Recently I had another episode of depression after a stressful work situation and not pursuing my own goals and hobbies. As it always happens I had forgotten how horrible depression is and I also had some doubts: would Effexor work again? I was very worried for the first two weeks. I read some negative reviews and thought maybe this time the medication would not work. It's part of the disease: we worry too much and expect the worst to happen. Well, I worried in vain: after 4 weeks Effexor kicked in again and I started to feel better, able to work, play, and enjoy life. It's been just over 8 weeks and I feel even better than before I started. About those who complain: there may be some genuine cases when this medication does not work, but in most cases I notice a unfair whining about side effects. I can't understand how can some sweating, nausea or temporary loss of libido compare to the horrible abyss of depression? Well they don't in my case. I have experienced some increased sweating, a bit of nausea for about 2-3 days, and a loss of libido for about 2-3 weeks. But after a matter of weeks the body adjusts and everything is normal. Depression makes us all worry and think negative scenarios. No need to add to that and deter somebody from using a medication that just may work for them. There is hope - whether from this medication or some other treatment. Get well soon everyone and take some action. It's too much I know, but taking the first steps is all that is required.

I started taking it because of the stress of nursing school and issues with my spouse, everything just piled on.  I jokingly call it my ""I don't give a crap"" med. I'm able to turn things off and not get so wrapped up in little irritating things.  The bad part is trying to wean, I only take 37.5 mg daily, it's pretty low.

Paxil recently started to be less effective for my anxiety and depression, so I was given Effexor as I titrated off of the Paxil. Eventually the Effexor XR was raised to 225 mg per day. At first I thought the effexor would work for me, as my ""old self"" seemed to return. But then I started getting angry and felt intense rage! My personality was changing a LOT and I had suicidal thoughts all the time! I would cry over any little thing and/or get terribly mad! I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown! I went to my healthcare provider and she has now had me start titrating off of the effexor and has added Prozac. I really do not understand why she ever tried me on effexor in the first place!
Today has been my third day without any effexor. I actually made myself skip a week of the titration! Next week was supposed to be the ""stop it completely"" week. I have been sick in bed all day. Diarrhea, some nausea (vomited once), and earlier today I had extreme thirst! 
Anyway, so far I have not had any brain zaps. But I would suggest to anyone considering this drug to weigh all your options. I would never say to someone to never use it though. It has helped some people immensely. As for me, NO!"

I suffered from panic attacks for years and tried a variety of anti-depressants to treat them.  Most worked marginally well, and usually came with some unwanted side effects, particularly weight gain.  On Effexor, though, I feel like I've had my life returned to me, and there are practically zero side effects, provided you take it every day.  I am able to function so much better on a daily basis, and have been living a fuller life since starting this medication.  

Now for the downside.  I once missed a single dose because my pharmacy ran out, and within 6 hours of my normal dose time, I started feeling the effects.  Within 12 hours, I was sweating, nauseated, jittery, confused, etc.  I could barely sleep that night, and when I did, I had horrible nightmares.  The next day, I awoke feeling nothing like myself.  Literally, I felt like a different person was in my body.  I was incredibly irritable and had the worst vertigo I've ever experienced.  It was all I could do to get to the pharmacy once they had more, and within a couple hours of taking my dose, I was nearly back to normal.  After that incident, I did a great deal of research on this drug, and found that my experience was not uncommon at all, yet neither doctors, nor the warnings on the medication, nor the advice on site like this list any of these problems as a possibility.  I think a lot more people would be very hesitant to start this medication knowing how crippling it would be to try and get off it.  As some other reviewers have said, if there is any other option available to you, even if it doesn't work perfectly, I would strongly advise using that instead of starting an Effexor regiment. God willing, I will never miss a dose again, and God help me if I ever need to stop. :("

It also made my shoulders, neck and jaw very tensed up. Since I am bedridden w back pain, this is not good. As far as helping w hot flashes, it cut them in half. I'm taking it w herbal supliment and still hot! But I do like how it makes my mind feel. I've been on several anti d's before and  didn't get this result. It lowered my appetite severely and I lost weight. As far as withdrawl, what people r reporting is kinda normal for these meds. Take ur time stopping. Do not stop cold turkey, it's very dangerous. Overall, if ur looking for meds for very mild hot flashes, it will will work. I thought mine were mild, but have realised they r stronger than this med will help w. If ur depressed or have social anxiety i recommend it. Good luck :)

You have obviously turned down this path as there was no other option. I know i did, if there was another path i would have chosen it but to get me through depression Effexor has helped me more than any other anti depressant, natural medicine, yoga, exercise or any other crap that has been suggested. Everyone is different and unfortunately people reading this site may be put off by negative views of Effexor. How many people also tried crack and had negative experiences! end of the day Effexor is a drug and if it helps keep me sane and alive then i'll take it. its not forever. Ive weened off before and its not hard if you do it CORRECT! any drug has side effects including cold and flu tabs etc etc
Comparing this drug to Zoloft and Lexapro i have noticed best results. And NO weight gain unlike all the others.
But hey my body is different to any one elses out there so all you can do is trial and error. thats life!
I first experienced anti d's when i was 16 and watched my mum stuggle through cancer...she passed away 4 years later. Losing a loved one was the hardest thing i ever could face in life and found my only saviour was anti depressants. They werent forever, i weened off them 9 years later and remained off them for 2 years. 
I recently re-commenced the tablets as emotions stirred up with a few other life issues so for now im back on them. Its helping me for now and im happy so thats all that matters. Very few side effects for me so im a happy camper!
I would otherwise cry every day and at the drop of the hat. when i commenced the drug i did have increased thoughts of suicide but that has faded.
I can still orgasm lol but never as good drive as previous. I'd rather happiness everyday than a few seconds of pleasure.
Overall dont knock it until you try it.
I could bag Zoloft for making me violently ill but i know others that took it and are happy.

I kept taking it, though, because I was much less irritable and had lots of energy (both were a really nice change of pace for me, I'm cranky and tired usually). Had to stop taking Effexor because: 1) sweated VERY heavily with exertion or stress and it stunk; 2) could not sleep at night; 3) I was having more migraines, not fewer.  It did bring up my blood pressure, but I have low blood pressure, so that wasn't a problem for me. It took over 5 years for my sweating to become less excessive and stinky. I lost 10 lbs, another nice side effect.  As soon as I stopped taking the Effexor, the weight came back. I was happier on the Effexor, but no sleep = more migraines, and that just isn't something I can live with. As a side note, I can't take most meds due to side effects.

Withdrawal effects are horrendous, fever, dizziness, brain zaps, mood swings, rage, crying spells. Nevertheless, Effexor did work for me. It alleviated depression and anxiety quite well. I'm glad I took it. The worst side effect for me was the withdrawal effects that would occur if I didn't take it.  Since weaning from Effexor I have been trying a variety of things to balance my moods including fish oil, vitamins D & B complex, theanine, 5 htp, & melatonin. I am planning to try additional amino acids. See Henry Emmons, The Chemistry of Joy and The Chemistry of Calm, for some ideas.  It has been seven weeks since I discontinued Effexor, and I believe I may be okay without anti-depressants! Take it if you need it, and if you decide to go off it, do not take the process lightly. You will need a long weaning period. Take fish oil, and B-Complex for sure. Good luck.

However I've started to develop food intolerances for the first time in my life about 3 years ago, one of the worst effects being migraine from eating certain foods. 

Recently I experienced serious migraine from eating prawns.  I googled it (as I never had issues before) and to my surprise I found that my 'allergy' was linked to anti-depressants with MAOI (ref: http://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/guide/ty ramine-and-migraines).  The migraine was so severe that I could hardly move, aside from having to vomit or place ice on my head to try alleviate the excruciating pain.

In summary, this is just to send in my observations that the body can develop other problems long after stopping this drug.  Just something to be aware of.

Also heard that food intolerance cases are on the increase, can't help wondering whether it's because more and more people are taking anti-depressants (all things being equal, ie no pre-existing problems with food intolleraces)."

The worst times were in my teens and again in my 40's til now. I also have ADHD which I'm treated for. I tried the SSRI's and they were horrible for me! Then I was tried on Strattera and it was just as bad. My doctor then switched me to Cymbalta, and it worked well for me until United Health Care and Medco Started using Express Scripts and would no longer cover ANY portion of my Cymbalta Rx and because there's no generic, and won't be for another 6 years - since the manufacturer is now calling it a ""pain"" medication. My doctor was VERY reluctant to switch me to Effexor because I'm extrememly sensitive to meds, but after being off Cymbalta for a month I needed to be on something, and asked him to try me on Effexor and he agreed. We started on the XR, but by the evening it wore off and I felt SUPER irritable, so at my next appt, I asked him to switch me to 3x regular release/dat since I couldn't go to 2 XR's/day yet. At my next appt I'll ask him to move me up to 2 XR's per day because I felt more even and more evenly energized throughout the day. On the regular release I feel a definite crash around 5:30 PM every day, and I had to play around with whether to take 2 in the AM or to in the afternoon to have more energy early or  in the afternoon - it seems better to take two earlier, and one in the afternoon.
I realize the withdrawl, if I have to get to that will be awful, but apparently if you take a very small dose of different kinds of meds - from benedryl to 5-HTP to Xanax (w/the help of your doctor) it helps with the last part of the withdrawl - when you're ready to taper all the way off. That's what my doc said anyway - so hopefully I'll be able to cross that bridge when I come to it!"

This medication lowers my motivation to press on and succeed in life and at the same time does nothing to help me deal with my anxiety. The drug only helps you care less when you don't succeed or lose something you love. I should have never been prescribed this medication but unfortunately I was and have been taking it at 300mgs per day for 7 years. The problem with caring less is that you let go of things that are important to you and as time passes the worst things become. The combination of the chemical dependency and screwed up life choices this medication promotes makes an impenetrable fortress of misery keeping you on the drug for the rest of your life. Please also consider the affects on your organs (liver) which will make your body sick. The positive reviews sound so fake. People who are depressed do not use exclamation points. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!!!!

I was on Cymbalta for anxiety, depression and neuropathy.  I have been experiencing more and more bouts of depression lately and wonder it if might be because I'm taking the generic version and not the brand name or if perhaps my doctor should increase my dosage or change me back to Cymbalta.  I'll discuss that at my next appt.  Several years ago I tried to commit suicide.  Lately I'm feeling worthless and very sad.  I don't want to go that route again.  I want to be happy I just don't know if it's possible. You see, I've suffered from depression most of my life and it seems perhaps it's just not meant to be.

I am taking the drug for depression and social anxiety (some borderline traits) and to stop OCD thoughts. Initially the drug seemed to help me focus a bit better. That has gone away. I haven't noticed a significant improvement in any area, perhaps it's too soon to tell. However I am likely going to switch meds: the side effects are bothering me. Loss of appetite (have lost about ten pounds without intending to or wanting to), integestion that is getting worse, some difficulty n the toilet as well (sorry if tmi). This may work for some people, but it doesn't seem to be my best bet :)

Depression and anxiety symptoms returned in 2002 and I was prescribed Effexor.  Have been taking it daily since 2002 @ 150mg.  

In the past couple of years I have noticed an increase in side effects; especially the dizziness/lightheaded feeling, blurred vision (especially when working on the computer), and headaches.  

My psychiatrist suspected and confirmed that I have ADD (TOVA testing, plus historical info).  I was possibly misdiagnosed back in 1998 and 2002.  

I want to stop taking the Effexor but it's VERY difficult to stop.  If I miss one day I get extremely dizzy. My psychiatrist wants to establish my ADD medication routine prior to stepping me down on the Effexor.  

I have added Vyvanse to my daily medication.  This seems to be working fine, but not sure the Effexor is doing much except giving me awful side effects.

Started on 37.5mg pill and was supposed to work up to 4 pills a day at bedtime.  After several months I have only made it to 2.5 pills a day because of the side effects.  It makes me REALLY tired, even the next day I am so groggy I am having trouble getting to work and staying awake for 8 hrs.  I've gained weight, it's caused my severe mood swings and depression.  The worst is when I take it I get really nauseated, anxious and I can't handle any sound (like the tv) or people or light.  I've been hanging in hoping the side effects would go away or would be worth the benefit of non-opiod pain relief, but so far not!  No interest in sex, I am way too young for this crap I'm done.

After about 4 - 6 weeks, I suddenly started to feel calmer.  Amazing difference!  After all this time, I occasionaly feel a twinge of anxiety, but my lifestyle is definitely a factor and the anxiety is still far more manageable than it used to be. 
Just don't miss a dose because you'll get the Effexor dreams!  They are bizarre and always have the unmistakable feeling of doom!
During waking hours, you may get some buzzing in the brain as well.  
However, these symptoms only happen when your system gets low on the drug.

None of them helped with my anxiety, and made me even more depressed. I have taken Effexor for anxiety/ panic attacks for 3 years now. I had a one year break, due to loss of health insurance. Effexor is a miracle to me! I did not experience the severe withdrawals that others on this forum have commented on. Any symptoms I had when quitting were extremely mild. I have suffered fom panic attacks and recurrent 'episodes' of severe anxiety since I was a teenager. While taking Effexor my panic and anxiety episodes are non existent. I currently take the drug 150 mg/day and am so thankful, I can get out of bed without all the pain I used to have, due to having panic attacks at night. And since returning to normal on the drug, it has helped me lose the weight I gained from being so anxious/depressed before I started the drug. Everyone should ask their doctor for their professional opinion, because this drug is a miracle for some people!

Felt so nauseous, almost puked twice, and had terrible sweating and insomnia. Day two (took 1/4 of a 100 mg pill 4 times throughout the day, in a fog all day, slept all day and all night. couldn't eat, was a mess. Day 3. woke up with head buzzing and felt high as a kite for hours. DID NOT take meds at all. horrible burning in stomach and anxiety at night from not taking, but went away.

I am taking the lowest dose possible, 37.5 mg, and began getting results by the second night. I take it in the morning and take 100 mg of Trazadone at night for sleep. The Effexor generic seems to ease anxiety during the night, when I awaken, allowing me to go back to sleep, rather than lying awake for hours, even with Trazadone. At this time, I feel comfortable in taking the lowest dose of Effexor. The generic is very affordable.

I was prescribed it for repeated anxiety and depression after the birth of my son. I am much more easygoing since taking this drug. I tried many different anti-depressants before this, and they usually worked well. However they were mostly ineffective for my anxiety/panic attacks. This drug is no fun if you stop taking it. If I miss a dose I feel very drowsy when I wake up about 48 hours after taking it. I went for a week without it and I got pretty nervous and on edge, I was tired, I was cranky and moody, but I was able to continue to work and take care of my son. That is probably why my doctor put me on different meds before trying this one. Now that I am on this medicine I can't imagine my life without it. I was suffering far more than I realized I was and life was far more of a struggle than it is now. I had a little nausea and blurred vision but this went away with treatment.
97$Condition: Depression$9/28/2012 7:33:17 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$5$"I was on this for about 5 months, although I worked my way up to 300mg pretty quickly. Unfortunately for me, none of the effects really helped me. I think the drug was doing everything it was supposed to do, but I just wasn't the right candidate.

Bad news before the good news:
This drug didn't work or help me, but I think that might be because I have a form of bipolar 2 that is difficult to detect. (I am trying a mood stabilizer now that seems to be helping) Effexor definitely increased my blood pressure, which in turn made me feel dizzy or weak after exerting myself. I was rather flushed on my first couple weeks on the high dose. I didn't sleep well and often felt caffeinated. I seemed to startle much more than usual. 

Good News: From my experience, I can say Effexor was a POWERFUL drug and perhaps a great drug for refractory depression folks. I never experienced any libido problems -- probably difficulty getting off at first, but that issue faded away. I have heard a lot of reviews saying that Effexor is a slow but powerful drug -- it may take up to 8-12 weeks on your target dose to really feel yourself turned around. Anyone trying it right now should have hope, knowing that they are on a beast of an AD.

About the withdrawals: Very little for me! I lucked out considerably. I basically cut it off very quickly, knowing that the drug was probably more bad than good for me. I got a few ""shocks"", but not painful, just weird. They were gone in a couple weeks."

I know if I should ever decide to stop taking it, it will be pure hell getting off of it. My advice is to avoid this med and hopefully there is something else out there that will help. Also advise researching before starting any drugs. Like I said, had I done some research about Effexor prior to starting it, I would not have ever started it.

It gave me my sex drive back (unlike any other). However, if I would miss even ONE day of this pill the side effects are SEVERE! I am not trying to get off of this pill and the side effects are INSANE! ie: Depression came back, Severe Dizziness, Sleepy-Tired ALL the time, Emotionally unstable,etc. Don't ever start this pill if you do not intend to continue taking it forever. You will never be able to get off of it without INTENSE, SEVERE side effects!!!

Had the mood swings, depression with other peri menopausal symptoms. This med definitely raises your body temperature. But it definitely calmed my moods down. Almost too much . I don't have the feelings of panic or urgency on certain situations which I did before. My emotions are also more flat. Also helps with Obbsesive thoughts. Going thru tough times in marriage too. Think it has helped me overall. Also feel dizzy when missing a dose.

I didn't get help until I was 14, big mistake. I took Prozac 40mg first but the doctor found it was ineffective although I am telling her it is working fine. She changes me o 75mg of Effexor. I took it for a month and had severe nausea. When I switched doctors I later found out the doctor that prescribed Effexor didn't prescribe it correctly. The immediate release tablets are meant to be taken 3 times a day and I was taking it once a day basically making the pill useless. I am back on the Prozac now and the side effects are much more tolerable. I just wonder how this drug would have effected me if I took the extended release version. But all in all, I just couldn't handle the severe nausea every time I took it.

I tried 3 other drugs before this one and it's the best. Unfortunately, all of them have sexual side-effects. Then, you start needing more and more, and it's hard to get off of. Very weird withdrawal. Diziness, head flashes, waekness, crabiness. But once you take it again, you never realized how much it helped. It makes you feel good, and even keeps me from going to sleep. SO--there are a couple of ups and downs to keep in mind. -T., Madison, WI

As I got older I tried to wean myself off of my previous medicine. I went one year without medication and it was terrible : I couldn't drive or work. I decided to go back on medication and my Doctor suggested we try Effexor. For the past 5 years I have been on a low dose of 75 mg that I take once a day before bed. My life is so much better. I can do anything. I have travelled, went to University and no longer suffer. I know I will most likely have to be on medication forever because of my chemical imbalance, and this worries me for when I want to start a family (I haven't read too many positives about being on Effexor and pregnant). If i miss a dose I can tell right away as I feel dizzy and disorientated. The pros of this medication outweigh the cons for me.

I was using it for about three years.  It actually helped get rid of really bad headaches I was getting, but I gained 30 lbs in 3 months. I could not sleep, and when I did I had the most horrible dreams and woke up most nights in a panic. During the day I went from being emotionless to a screaming lunatic.  My doctor refused to help wean me off the drug so I did it on my own.  It took me almost 2 months to get past the really bad withdrawal symptoms, I fell on a flight of stairs when my legs went numb.  I have been off the drug for over 3 years but the side effects still hit me. It is as if my brain takes a few seconds to digest information, conversations, questions anything. I often find myself staring at the person not understanding and then I finally process the information.  I have half the mental ability I had before taking this and no motivation or drive.  If anyone has gone through this and found a way out, would love to hear from you.

The meds can definitely work but there are side effects sometimes.  I am now going to try another drug to treat the sweating problem, hopefully it will help."

So worth it to me. I did not find that it made me gain weight as much as other drugs, but that has a direct correlation to my level of activity too. for more than one reason, i am not excited about having to ween off of it when i get pregnant. i do plan on taking it again, if needed, once i can again.

Ultimately, I began feeling jittery and had trouble getting a good night's sleep.  2. Even the generic of this drug can be extremely expensive.  3. When trying to discontinue the Effexor, I experienced nausea, diarrhea, and episodes of rapid heartbeat for weeks.  

I'm switching back to an SSRI, but NOT Paxil.  It caused weight gain.  Meanwhile, it's still not totally understood why the same drug can affect different people in such a variety of ways. Thus, finding a ""perfect fit"" may take some unpleasant trial and error.  (When it came to Paxil, the perfect fit certainly didn't extend to my skinny jeans!)  How convenient for physicians to have us available as experimental rats...

Withdrawals were horible first 3 days. Had all the terrible withdrawals and basically stayed in bed. I believe the switch to Celexa instead of going off Effexor cold turkey saved me weeks of agony. I am sorry for so many that have to completley go off Effexor due to losing their insurance, etc. I would not go back on Effexor or recommend it unless you are going to be on it for life! I chose Celexa because it is less expensive therefore, insurance is willing to pay without the hassels I had with Effexor. Also, after researching Celexa, supposedly the side effects are not as severe if I choose to stop it later.

At first, I thought it was a miracle cure...my depression was cured and I lost a lot of weight!!!  As time went by it was less and less effective.  When the decison was made to change meds I could not get off of it!  I went thru the proper procedure to wean myself off and, of course, i was doing so per my doctor's instructions, but the withdrawals were unbearable!  It was like my brain was scrambled!  I couldnt make ANY decisions!  If someone asked me if I wanted coke or pepsi I was not capable of deciding.  After much agony I finally got thru it and was put on Lexapro.  Lexapro is not nearly as helpful as Effexor was, but I can go for several days without Lexapro and still function normally.  I'm not sure what the deal with Effexor is, but it's a real shame because it was very effective for a long while.

To top it off my psychiatrist would not listen to me or take my complaints seriously!! Eventually I had the courage to see just a GP. I now take 10mg of Cipralex and I have my life back!!

He pisses me off because he has never suggested counseling.  The biggest side effect I wish to share are the frightful, colorful, detailed nightmares.  If I miss one dose, my dreams are so very realistic.  People I have known and know now are part of my dream.  Situations with these people where I feel that things were unresolved or I cause negativity in our lives are animated so clearly in these dreams.

I have gained over 50 pounds while taking Effexor and my sex drive is nearly nonexistent.  I forget things often and my family notices this.  I cannot remember the last time I cried. It is great to feel like I can cope with life, but I do not like the extra weight.

Have had instances where it seemed this was not enough (depression continued), but increasing the dosage by 50% was not effective at all, even detrimental (depression worsened).  Am now back to the 75 per day, but still battle with depression.  Am hesitant to add any more meds to my life.  Started this drug in the wake of breast cancer (chemo, radiation and after-effects) 3 years ago, in conjunction with Ativan (for anxiety) and Neurontin (for extreme neuropathy).  Have completely eliminated Ativan and Neurontin, but feel like something is missing...  Following up with doctors on correct dosage is very difficult (depressing!).

I was then hospitalized for 2wks in psyc unit. after trying five other med combos I was put back on effexor 300mg I also take a mood stabilizer.I no longer see a therapist(stopped 3yrs ago). I am now down to 75mg. I also take a mood stabilizer(I have bipolar).I take my meds at bedtime. This helps with the tiredness. Its very important to take at the same time everyday. I have very few side affects as long as I take it regularly.  I do have dry mouth, but gum helps with this.  and I have to be careful not to get overheated in the summer.I am not concerned with withdrawal symptoms because I will be on medication for the rest of my life.

233$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/29/2010 7:35:49 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$This medication works well; however I had experienced several side effects that made me uncomfortable (nausea, dry mouth, stomach pain and constipation)after three days of taking the medication.  The pain usually started during the digestion of the medication.The anxiety had subsided and I feel okay after the stomach pain went away.  I might give this med a few weeks to see if I can manage the pain.  And, I have not noticed any change in my appetite.  I exercise on a regular basis and actually have noticed that I dropped a couple of pounds.  Although I do not think that the medication had anything to do with that.  So, I guess I will have to check back in and let you know how it goes.

I was so nauseous during the day that I could only eat late at night and gained about 20 pounds. After three months of ""sticking with it"" I called my doctor about the side effects. She told me to quit cold turkey. After three days of feeling like I was about to have a seizure I sought a second opinion and was put back on the drug with a plan to get off of it completely.

I did not feel I needed something so potent, so i took half of the 75mg I was prescribed. Within 45 minutes I was so sick and confused I could hardly communicate. I was immediatelty sick, and was throwing up the rest of the day, not to mention in a state of delerium. 

I have taken medications like Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and Xanax, but NEVER have I reacted so badly to a medication. I am under the influence that I may have had an allergic reaction to this, that or it was just too potent for me and my needs. 

I suggest assesing your need for a medication, and how intense you think your anxiety/depression is. I feel this drug provides more seratonin/dopamine than I may have needed for my mild-moderate anxiety."

Began at the 75mg level at the age of 18 and switched to 150mg after a year. Recently switched to the regular from the extended release due to my insurance. 

This medicine has been amazing for me. I used to experience severe mood swings, anger and anxiety. The only side effects I have are vivid nightmares on occasion and I bruise very easily. I did take this drug with both pregnancies due to the fact that the benefits outweighed the consquences and at the time not much was known about the effects Effexor has on pregnancy. My boys were perfectly healthy and happy. 

I have tried to go off of Effexor a couple times working with my doctor. I was weaned off and put on another medication over a few months. The withdrawl and side effects were horrid. I had severe anxiety to the point I felt like my insides were shaking. I had flu-like symptoms and felt like my head was in a cloud. The anger was the worst. I was full of rage for no reason and was extremely mean. I can't say for sure my symptoms were caused from withdrawl or were from my depression. 

I would highly recommend this medicine if you truly need it but be very careful and research the side effects. Plan on being this medicine forever once you begin."

My doctor put me on the generic version of Effixor (Venlafaxine)about 6 years ago and I have been on it since. I have to say it is a ""wonder"" drug. It's  made life on earth worth living. The improvement this drug has made greatly out weights the negative side effects. I take 150mg per day. 75mg in the morning and 75mg at bed time. You can't miss a dose. If I do my brain starts to hum inside, (i can't explain it as there is nothing i can reference it to),I become aggitated and I know something is wrong.

I still get them, but maybe they'd be worse without.  I do sleep well at night and haven't had any concerning noticeable problems with it.  HOWEVER:  Recently I ran out and didn't pick up the new ones over the weekend (2 days).  BIG MISTAKE!!  Now I know what its like to be a addict and go thru withdrawals!!!  This med is BAD, i had no idea it would be so awful, puking, shaking, sweating, couldn't think of anything but getting more!! It was horrible! Needless to say, I did get my pills and started back on them, and do feel better again. But after experiencing that ordeal, it is apparent that this is an addictive medication and I want off, but after reading others reviews, it doesn't sound easy.  I'm totally disgusted. It has kept me from being edgy and flying off the handle, as I did before I was on hormones, then changed to this med.  But also has affected my libido, basically no desire. I haven't had any problems with weight gain, altho I do seem to sweat alot. All in all, I am not satisfied with this drug and I DO NOT RECOMMEND this med to anyone for hot flashes or other change of life signs.  By any means, DO NOT TAKE IT!!  I'm checking into bio-identicals or anything else, no more of this.  Its going to take awhile to get off it apparently and I'm not looking forward to it either....in fact I'm scared!!

It worked at first but continued with serious problems and dosage would be increased. With each increase new symptoms would appear, paranoia, anger, outrageous behavior. Later I was diagnosed bipolar and added a mood stabilizer and had much more control. Problem is, the new symptoms are still present, just more controlled. And I cannot get off of it. I have tried several times. One time weaning slowly off for a period of 6 months. The withdrawl affects were unbearable. I hate it, I wish I had never started on it.

After 5 weeks I honestly feel more capable, less pessimistic and less bothered by the unusual things that can disrupt your life. 

My stressors are 10-fold now what they were when I began this drug and I feel more confident of coping and overcoming.  This is not a magic pill by any means you also have to do ""self-work"" and really invest in making your life different.  

However for an anti-depressant the side effects have been minimal (moderate weight gain but now I feel more motivated to exercise and manage my weight as a result).

I highly recommend for the right diagnosis.

I had pretty intense weight gain - about 20-25lbs - and it makes me very tired.  I was originally taking 75 in the AM and 150 in the PM, but the 75 made me so tired that I either had to nap again before going to work, or I'd fall asleep during my drive to work.  Scary!  Now I just take both at night.  I frequently have very vivid dreams, and sometimes I can't remember if I dreamt something or if it really happened.  I had brain zaps when I first started and as I increased the dosage, but those have mostly stopped.  But my moods are definitely better overall and my depression has lessened.  I might look into Cymbalta, as I'm really frustrated about the weight gain.

I have had no side effects and the medication has worked well with my other medications.  I would also strongly recommend that often times have to give psychiatric drugs 8-12 weeks before they reach a therapeutic level to even work, so give them a chance.  Additionally, don't expect everything from your medications; you should also be involved in counseling and group therapy for an adequate time ( I still go regularly to a psychiatrist and to a therapist) to better help you understand whatever disorder you've been diagnosed with and help you cope with the challenges that go along with it.

If you forget to take a dose one day, not pleasant experience - you feel like you have intense flu and very strange feelings.  Don't like the 50 pounds gained, but Effexor has given me more of a normal life - I am thankful for that.  I sometimes think I should start weaning off this drug, however, I then think of where I was to now, so I then stop and think, what the heck, weight gain, being on a anti depressant - humm, it helps me function - I'll stay on the low dose.

294$Condition: Depression$3/9/2010 6:02:45 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$5$"I have tolerated this drug better than others (BuSpar (hallucinations), Paxil (intense lethargy but lovely sleep), Zoloft (ugly rash), & Prozac (intense suicidal thoughts). Xanax - a calmer - is so nice, but unfortunately docs fear its addictiveness and it treats anxiety but not depression (unless the depression is caused by anxiety). 

The nice thing about Effexor: it covers both of my symptoms - depression and anxiety. I have gained about 50 pounds, however, which has been consistent in the past 14 years since I started it. 

You definitely will know if you miss a dose as you will have waves moving through your head and feelings of detachment from reality. This scares me as I'm sure it will affect tapering off, which I hear isn't easy to do. It's a powerful drug and can be very effective. But, you have to be strongly committed to sticking with it. It takes weeks to kick in and you can't stop taking it abruptly. Also you must be sure to not miss doses or you will suffer extreme side effects as your brain tries to adjust to life without the chemicals it craves. 

I had weird intense dreams before starting Effexor but they have become even more extreme on it. Be ready for that. The dreams will intensify your psychological conflicts."

I do experience night sweats & occasional upset stomach but nothing severe. The dizziness is most prevalent and the reason I looked @ reviews to see if anyone else was experiencing the same.  The 1st few weeks I noticed a decrease in appetite but that went away (unfortunately) :o)  If anything, I don't gain weight but have trouble LOOSING it.  The best thing to report is that I have not experienced any SEXUAL side effects as with other meds! I initially began taking depression meds for anxiety/short fuse/easily frustrated & feelings of being let down. Through the course of taking meds I became depressed instead of anxious. Lexapro wasn't quite enough for me, Zoloft was TOO much & Lorazapam was just a quick fix. Effexor has been good for me but I wonder if it's effectiveness will wear off over time as other meds have. From reading reviews, it seems that this med is NOT for EVERYONE. I would try it ONLY after other common meds have failed you.

My weight gain has been beyond disheartening.  My doctor said she purposefully put me on this because of the side-effects (nausea, headaches, diarrhea, etc.) so I would not try to quit or wean myself off due to this commonly happening when people start to feel better or think they no longer need it.  She'll help wean me when WE feel the med is no longer needed.  
Counseling/therapy is also important since depression is due to life issues, both conscious and unconscious,that have gone unresolved.  Thank God for meds and my psychiatrist!  (Just wish the weight would come off with exercise.)  
Anyone else experience weight gain???"

It helped somewhat but I would still go through bouts of depression.  Once I retired from the military, my new family doctor started prescribing 75mg of Effexor to me.  I have been taking Effexor now for nine years and am quite happy with it.  I rarely suffer from depression now and am much happier with life.  The only side effects I have are if I run out of my prescription and have to wait for more.  I start feeling ""waves"" of nausea and also feel unbalanced.  I cannot function well in normal activities such as driving and cannot concentrate well on work.  Needless to say, there is a degree of dependency on Effexor.  For those that are uncomfortable with feeling dependent on a drug than Effexor is not for you.  For me, getting rid of the feelings of hopelessness and self-pity have made Effexor the antidepressant drug of choice.   "

Dr put me on this to replace the hormone replacement therapy I'd been on for 4 yrs, to control hot flashes mainly.

I haven't noticed any other effects from the drug really.  I have lost 14 lbs since going off the HRT tho!  I don't have depression altho before starting HRT, I did find I would fly off the handle easily and had other menopause symptoms. The HRT controlled that aspect, and haven't had that ""urge to blow"" on this either.It is quite expensive tho, so wish there was another option??

The biggest drawback I've found, is, DON'T ever let your prescription ""lapse"" for any reason.

I have been a long term pain person, taking ten meds a day, and getting damn tired of doing it. The chore itself was dragging me down, heading to the med chest over and over and over. Combined with low testosterone and having to slather myself with gel daily to get that up, also became part of this nuiscence. So, I asked for something and this was it. Now, I am la di da over most things, while my wife weighs the pros and cons of various things, I simply just go about it all with out too much of a care. I am taking 37.5 2x a day. Is this worth the garbage you must endur to get off of it? I guess I will let you know, as I already have an issue with dizzyness and a whooshing as I turn my head quickly, like to see if a car is coming as I enter the highway. That is being teated by a CT scan of my head and a neurologist and Prednosone. Ho, will he be surprised this could be the culprit! So I will go with half the drug for two weeks, then off we go.

The paic attacks started at a very young age and over the years, I developed many phobias as a result.  I was given many drugs over the years, but never took them.  My life became ""smaller"" and ""smaller"", and in desperation, after many years of therapy that never really helped, I agreed to take Effexor.  For two weeks, I had every reaction listed.  But at the end of the two weeks, my life began.  All of the fear and anxiety was gone!  All the things I couldn't do for years, or would do with incredible fear, was not a problem.  I consider it a miracle!  Yes, I don't like to think I will have to take it always, but I know that my disorder is genetic and won't go away because it is a chemical imbalance. Many of my family members and children have the same issues.  I know I was lucky, and on the first try, got the right medication for me. Life is good."

After the initial week of side effects, I had 6 months where it worked.  The last three months I've become mentally slower, physically weaker, I feel shakey and my hand is starting to shake.

That's when I recognized that it may be the medication that we both take. 
382$Condition: Other$4/10/2009 11:20:13 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$1$5$"Effexor or its generic is a ""good and bad"" story for me: good, in that it did a great job at managing my A.D.D. (and the depression that can come from it); bad, because I gained 75 POUNDS while on it! My family doctor thought I had something wrong metabolically. She ran all kinds of tests on liver function, blood sugars, etc. Nothing. No matter how much I exercised or dieted, the weight kept piling on. The clincher was when my wife and I did the South Beach diet. She lost about 15 pounds; I gained about 10 (and no cheating at all). While researching Effexor on the internet, I kept seeing comments about weight gain over and over again. When I asked my psychiatrist about it, he seemed not to know! So we moved me off of Effexor and on to Wellbutrin and a small dose of Prozac. BINGO! I've already lost about 30 pounds in the six months since then, without any change in diet or exercise. In fact, with my crazy schedule (I'm a pastor), I've exercised LESS in the past six months than I usually do. No doubt - it was the Effexor. I have one warning for anyone reading this who wants to get off: the withdrawal period is going to be really WEIRD! I had some strange effects during the about three weeks it took for the Effexor to filter out of my body. Things like your head feeling like it's whooshing around in a breeze, sudden surges of ""voltage"" through your body (no pain), occasional minor twitches of muscles for short periods of time. None of it was enough to impair me - it just wasn't very pleasant. If you've gained a bunch of weight while taking Effexor, I'd venture to say: it's the drug. Your psychiatrist can prescribe some combination of other things that will work well for you. My combo of Wellbutrin and Prozac is doing the job admirably for me. Hang  in there! "

I take 75 mg daily.  The first six months were great.  I had some side effects at first, but after a week, they went away almost completely.  It really helped with my anxiety and I was very satisfied.  

After about 6 months on Effexor, things started to change and I started feeling pretty bad.  Now I feel a little dizzy and ""drunk"" all of the time.  I also have a minor headache all the time, which occasionally escalates into a debilitating migraine.  I've also noticed I'm more compulsive than I used to be.  For example, I feel a compulsion to do the same things after work every day.  Or, if I start a task (cleaning or gardening for example), I can't stop until I have finished every single possible related job.

Has anyone else noticed this?  My first instinct is to stop taking it.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?  I don't really know what to do now.  I don't want to feel anxious any more, but I also don't want to feel the way I feel right now.  Any comments would be appreciated!"

I take 225mg of Effexor and 15mg of Diazepam per day. It's the forth drug combination I have tried and probably the best so far..but things still aren't right. Hard to judge if Effexor is really effective or not, without my re-diagnosis to go by. If it works for you, then great! If not, try another drug or drugs. I'm just not sure yet about my situation..it is a long process!

We finally got it  right. I experieced lightheadedness and nausea at first, then as we increased dosage I almost felt euphoric...and I didn't like that! It did, however, go away. Four years later, I tried (with doctor help) to wean off the medication. It threw me for a loop! I couldn't hack it! Severe mood swings, crying episodes, fatigue...so-am I chronically (as in forever) depressed and doomed to stay on this med...I don't know...but it really changed my life.

I had a horrible feelin in my head, like someone was blowing air in it and terrible nightmares.  My regular doctor prescribed it and when I told my obgyn I was taking it he informed me that it was very addictive. He was right!!!!!!!! Please be careful when taking the medication, it has taken me several months and another antidepressant to get off of it.
445$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/8/2008 4:41:51 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$2$2$"First and foremost, I have no history of drug reactions, allergies, etc.  I am just an average, healthy chick w/ anxiety!

This is a complicated medication.  When I was switched to it, I was given short-term disability for reasons I didn't know at the time, but went with it.

Now that I look back, this med is just as hard to go on as it is to go off!  Going on, I had episodes of serious nausea to the point where I had to pull of the side of the road because I thought I had to vomit.  

When that is said and done, the medication DOES work.  I experienced no anxiety attacks at all.  That was pretty cool, but let me tell you, you surely don't need to watch a clock so you don't miss a dose.  For me, when the clock got close to meds time, the withdrawl symptoms of this med started rearing their ugly head.  I mean, even within an hour or so of the time it is normally taken...an internal alarm clock, of sorts.

What you read about withdrawl symptoms is COMPLETELY accurate.  I've always described them as ""the throbs"", but brain zaps works juts as well.  They get worse REALLY QUICKLY and it is the most debilitating feeling.  Keep missing them and you can be keeping your head still and just move your eyes and those ZAPS move whenever your eyes hurt. You are kind of ""zombied"".  It is HORRIBLE.  

It's been 6 years since starting this stuff and the ONLY reason why I am still on it is because it is easier than going off...seriously. I cannot EVEN believe there hasn't been any sort of law-suit with how horrific the side-effects are!!! 

Today, my meds are late coming in the mail and I am nearly 48 hours down and in a state of complete bewilderment, so to speak.  I am crying because of the w/drawls...it is TRULY that bad and I had to get a script called into the pharmacy so I don't lose my head.  
There ought to be a law against stuff like
 this...SERIOUSLY.  
Bottom line, had I known 6 years ago what I know now, NO WAY! Search Google, TONS of stories!. retrowfmk at yahoo dot com "

It help me immensly in the beginning to slow down my head and let me concentrate on getting better.  After about 6 months when I was more stable (not suicidal) and feeling level, I decided to start weaning off.  The reason I chose to decrease my dose was because along with making me calmer and more level, I found it also took away my personal creativity and the ability to think fluidly.  I found myself having a hard time articulating and it drove me crazy.  Physically the only negative side effect I had was a strange feeling when I turned my head to fast, like what I had just looked at and turned away from was trailing me in my side vision.  
I am off effexor now and am doing well. Being on it helped me slow down and get the help I needed (talk therapy), though I am happy to be off it, as I feel more like me how I am supposed to be with no pharmecutical help.   "

I use to fall into depression where I couldn't eat only work go home and sleep, sometimes having to take off from work because my emotions were to high.

About 8 months into the treatment I would awaken everyday with feelings of hopelessness and a wish to simply not exist. The doctors said I needed to see a psychiatrist and get treatment for this severe depression. I tried several anti-depressants including Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft with no success. I finally tried Effexor and it worked! I lost the feelings of hopelessness, I found I was able to smile, I regained some energy and generally felt better. At the end of the HEP C treatment I stopped the Effexor treatment also but after a couple of months the depression returned and was quite disabling. I ended up taking Effexor again and the depression subsided. I have been taking Effexor in doses of 150 mg to 225 mg for the past 5 years and have been able to return to work, enjoy my family and life in general. If I stop taking the Effexor I find myself slipping back into depression after just a few days. I am taking the time to write this to provide a note of encouragement to people who have not found a way out of their depression. As I said, I had to try several before I found something that worked but I kept trying. I also use diet and exercise and therapy and prayer and meditation. I need them all to stay in the light. I still have days when I awaken with my head in a negative space but with the help of the medicine, doctors and prayer and helping other people worse off than I am I find life is usually pretty good and often downright great!

My anxiety attacks stopped almost immediately. I still get depressed, but only now usually before my monthly cycle which is common for women. I have more energy and way more patience. I too have the ""zaps"" when I miss a dose. The major downside for me to this med. is the weight gain. I've gained 17lbs in 3 mos.

Sweating, Chills, Bad Headache, Nausea, Restlessness, Inability to sleep, Cloudy thinking just to name a few.

484$Condition: Depression$3/8/2008 4:07:38 PM$Reviewer: hillguy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I started with Prozac and withing hours I was on a high and then about 1 year later I started to sleep around the clock and was back in depression.  I have been on several others with limited effectiveness or none at all.  Then I was prescribed Effexor and in light of my past drugs I am very happy with it.  If I go off of it within a few weeks I am back in the mental mud bog and sinking. I am now very sure to have enough effexor on hand.  I still get depressed and most people that I know do.  However, now my depression is about something that I can work through but, I never want to be without the effexor.  I don't think that there is any medication that can work 100% 24/7.  Compared to the person that just sat on the couch in front of the TV and drink or sleep much of the time.  I find it a blessing no matter what anyone says (Mr. Cruse) it has helped me so much.  I actually can plan for something or get excited about something or just go out to be out.  Before I was in front of the TV sucking down 2 six packs a day and sleeping the rest of the day and not to mention my anger.  My depression has had an effect on riends and family or just meeting someone.  So, you can jump on a couch or tell me that I am brain washed and I'll tell you that I am better off today than before I started effexor.  People tell me that I am a different person and I actually choose to help people with their depression because of what I have gone through.  I'm not a doctor but, my exeriance has helped other people.  I now think positive thoughts instead of negative ones.  So, MAKE TODAY THE VERY BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE.

I've had problems with recurring major depressive disorder for as long as I can remember, but it took one really bad episode in my adulthood to make me consider taking an antidepressant.

I have to say, taking the meds in combination with talk therapy has improved the quality of my life beyond measure.

Most of the complaints people have here are about weight gain, decreased libido and withdrawal effects.

My weight gain started before taking Effexor, so I can't blame it on that - I know it was due to a lifestyle change. I had decreased libido for about 6 months, but then it returned back to normal.

And FYI - you're going to have withdrawal effects when you stop taking any antidepressant. The key is to taper off slooooooowly and with the supervision of your doctor. 

Not everyone needs to take Effexor (or any antidepressant) forever, but for me - as long as it keeps me in remission, I'm a happy camper."

I am now taking some OTC items which are helping tremendously. I saw that some people trying to escape the Effexor demon were taking fish oil supplements and multivitamin/minerals, so I'm now taking Organic Flaxseed Oil and a Mega Vitamin/Mineral Complex with an additional boost of B-Complex Vitamins which I purchase cheaply with very low shipping costs from http://www.VitaCost.com. Some treatment programs are stating that with the depletion of antioxidants, one needs to add a product such as gluathione supplementation. This is also available from VitaCost very cheaply. I've added another super antioxidant, Acai pure freeze-dried pure organic powder from Amazon Thunder, the provider of Acai for the Oprah Show documentary. I take my scoopful daily in juice, but some people like it in applesauce, yogurt, etc. It has no sugar added and is completely organic. It's available from http://www.amazonthunder.com/members/coonmartranc h. I've been using these dietary boosters during the entire time and will continue to do so for several months after I'm completely off the Effexor as my withdrawal symptoms have been minimal. Let me know if this suggestion helps or not. Best wishes.........

I have been on Effexor for over 4 years and will probally be on it for a lot longer as I am a cronic depression sufferer.The only side effects I did suffer were cold night sweats for about a year, and night mares but compared to how I was feeling that is a small price to pay.I have also had a baby whilst on this medication with no effects to my child.He is very happy and healthy.It is very different for each and every person that is on anti-depressants and it is a very hard road to get better.I know thats all I use to hear was ""one day youll feel normal, it will get better just hold on"",at the time its so hard and you just dont want to but I can tell you first hand THAT IT REALLY DOES GET BETTER!!!Trust me.It couldnt get much worse right.I have had a lot of suicide around me I have recently lost 2 friends, and have in the past lost 4 family members to suicide and I tell you, you are a long time dead.

Effexor worked like a charm.  When the divorce was over and things were settled then I went off the medication.  Everything was great for about 6 months and then the anxiety came back.  I went back on the Effexor and was back in control.  At this time, I really had no reason to have anxiety so i went off the meds again.  Suddenly I started having issues with high blood pressure so back on the Effexor again. The blood pressure is fine now.  I don't know if Effexor was the cause of any of this, but I really don't want to be a slave to this drug forever.

They are so bad they sometimes I have to send my kids to their grandparents until I get leveled out again.(I tend to destroy things which is very unlike me) While this is the most fast acting drug to treat what it is intended to: Panic, depression, anger. The side affects of not taking it is NOT worth it. I like many others was not told of the side effects of this costly drug or I would not have began taking it. Now without it though, I feel worst than a druggie.  And the amount of weight it has caused me to gain is unreal. I've gained close to 100lbs in 2 years. And the worst part is my appetite has decreased but my body absorbs every ounce of fat it gets thanks to this medicine. And sleep, I stay so tired it's unbelievable. I sleep 12-14 hrs a day more if I could. My sex life is nearly non-exsistent! Thank God, I have a understanding husband! I really would like to stop taking this Medicine. My doctor also told me that should I become pregnant to stop taking immediately. I don't think one could survive the withdrawl side effects added to the syptoms of a new pregnancy. And I can't imagine how unhealthy this med. would be for a fetus. I would recommend trying every ""non-addicting"" anti-depressant before taking this one. You CANNOT JUST QUIT!

    I was prescribed this drug when I was in sixth grade (six years ago), and it has been a bumpy road of on and off ever since. 

    When I was first prescribed, I was on a small dose. However eventually I would out-grow that dose and once again feel my general sings of: Nervousness, Anxiety, and my tourettic body maneuvers would return. 

     However after a while on this prescription, like all patients of this drug, I was slowly becoming addicted. This meant that, If I didn't take my prescribed dose once, It didn't matter If it was only one dose, or even if it was an unnoticed accident, before long I would be stumbling around like a drunk, I would have a headache so splitting that if I turned my head too fast it would feel like the blood in my skull was in a centrifuge on full turn. Not too mention my appetite would be lost, mostly because of the low-aching-numbness in my gut that nulled out all satisfactory feelings for food. Also there was muscle cramping. Normally you only feel a muscle cramp of this caliber if you just ran a couple-non-stop laps around a track and stopped to touch your toes, however this was not the case, My tendons, thighs, and even hands would go as far as to ""lock up"" if even given the mundane task of bending down to tie my shoes.

     However the effects while taking the drug could be even worse. For one I was so fatigued that I would be going to bed at 8:30 pm and still be exhausted at 6:00. Also weight gain, the extent of the weight gain was so massive that now, that I am attempting to cleanse the drug from my system( I've been clean about a week and lived with negative side effects every day since) but the weight gain was so massive that once I limited my intake of the drug, 
I was beginning to add new notches to shrink my belt every-so-few days. Not only has my 
weight gone down but I am actually able to 
stay awake.

    In the end all I am saying is, the choice is yours. Choose right.   "

I have panic disorder with agoraphobia but am now symptom free. I used to be housebound, afraid even to be alone at home. Since I became symptomatic in 1969 I had taken tricyclics with some success but was never able to go anywhere very much. I was a virtual prisoner. Even the infomercial lady talked to me on the phone and realized I had a physical source to my problem. My brain is sensitive to epinephrine. I needed something that would control the norepinephrine in my brain. Guess what? That's what Effexor XR has done!! I started taking it in 1996 at age 45. I can drive anywhere, go anywhere and do just about everything a normal person can do. I even went to Ireland and stayed alone in a small town for three weeks -- If someone would have told me that was possible before Effexor I would have said ""No Way!""
   It's not perfect. My worst side effect is insomnia. Better that than being a prisoner in my own home. The very worst things are FIRST The price. When might we see a generic equivalant? SECOND It is very hard to reduce the dosage or stop taking the medicine entirely. I experienced sort of a buzzing in my head (an actual noise), disorientation, tremors, sleeplessness, somnabulation (sleepwalking) when I did sleep, extreme hypertension that alarmed my internist so that I know I must be carefully watched if I ever have reason or desire to quit.
   If this medication doesn't work for your particular problem, don't be afraid to try something else. I have a lady next door to me who has my problem and hasn't left her house in 40 years. All because she is afraid of side effects. The life she has missed, it's sad.

Still have lingering short term memory loss & uncontrollable yawning.  Might be the mix of this med with my others.
609$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/23/2007 3:45:41 PM$Reviewer: songofthesouth, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking it for a few weeks now and I can't believe the difference in how I feel. The only side effect I've noticed is not feeling hungry hardly at all. Hey, works for me.
610$Condition: Depression$10/23/2007 2:08:46 AM$Reviewer: j, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$It seems to have a serious effect on my short term memory. My ability to cope with high body heat, like temprature or clothing is difficult.  Heat stroke could be a problem. My overall ability to cope with my stressfull life has improved. I can talk about stress related issues without crying. The downside is that there are times when I should cry and am not able to. It is impossible for me to fully  experience grief or justifiable anger or fear.  When my dog had to be put down I needed to cry in order to grieve and was not able to.  When my husband treatened my life I was unable to react with anger and so was put into a dangerous situation.  But I would not quit taking effexor.  It has helped me more than it has caused problems.

I have a pretty severe anxiety and panic disorder and have tried Lexapro and Paxil both to there maximum dosages with no success.  I will say so far Effexor seems to be more promising than the others and I haven't been needing to take my Xanax near as often."

622$Condition: Depression$10/1/2007 2:03:13 PM$Reviewer:  Jason, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$My Dr. had placed me on this, because I said I was going to kill myself, but in reality I didn't think I was ever going to get out of rehab after my car accident. They were just words and I got out of rehab a little over a week later. I was just in rehab for 5 months and I wanted to get out so I could finish school so I didn't have to repeat a year. 1) I shouldn't have said what I did 2) He should have listened when I told him I was just saying that 3) The drug messed with my head. I took myself off of it with no side effects. I do know I'm thrilled that I'm off it now, and have never been happier, even though I still had to repeat a year...

624$Condition: Depression$9/24/2007 7:00:31 PM$Reviewer: Nan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My doctor has me taking 75mg/day, alternating with 150mg/day (1 pill odd days, two pills even days).  I have had no problems, and my depression is under control.  When I began to take the 2nd pill, however, I developed a rash on my face from the moisterizer I have been using for years. It has vitamins C and E in it.  The rash took almost a week to go away, and when I tested the cream a few weeks later, I had the same rash.  I changed moisterizers and have had no other problems.
