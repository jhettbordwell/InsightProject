per day because of a serious heath issue that had me in a coma for about a week and a half. After recovery my doctor tried Effexor as a replacement. The medicine was so bad, I was seriously considering suicide daily and found myself actually looking for trees along the highway which would do the job. I was an avid duck hunter and one day across a pond was a tree. The tree began to move and come toward me across the pond. I immediately went to my doctor who weaned me off of the med. 
it took approximately 10-11 months to get off the medicine and get the suicidal thoughts out of my head. I was abusive to my family, which led to a divorce. My career was horribly affected and I lost many friends because of my ups and downs trying to get off of it. It was the worst experience of my life. I’ve heard nothing but horror stories about this medication. Please research it before you try it

The longer I was on Effexor the worse the side effects got.  On Effexor I started having insomnia that became so bad that I was lucky to get 2 hours of sleep a night.  I became so irritable and impatient that I started having almost uncontrollable fits of anger and cussing when I was alone in my car.  I also started cussing when I made a minor mistake.  Before I started taking Effexor I DIDNÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â ;?T cuss.  On Effexor I also became significantly more anxious and started experiencing compulsive behaviors that I had NEVER experienced prior to taking Effexor. I stopped taking Effexor a year ago, and I am still experiencing all of these negative changes in my personality except insomnia,  Once again, I want to emphasize that I NEVER had any of these issues before I took Effexor.

Was suppose to taper up to 150mg but took 1 pill of 37mg in the evening. The next morning I woke up feeling STRUNG OUT. Ended up in the hospital. HORRIBLE feeling.

5$Condition: Depression$1/21/2018 2:42:58 PM$Reviewer: D1nonlysnshn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $2$1$3$"I have been a ""highly funtioning"" depressed person for many years: life of the party, witty, intelligent, charming, intelligent conversationalist, highly successful at the top of the food chain in my field,
...until I got home. Work was an escape from myself for me. If I had no weekend functions to attend I would be catatonic, only getting out of bed to use the bathroom.
I had always felt like an outsider, looking in on life, trying to imitate what everyone else was doing, but never getting it quite right and others sensing that I was a fake.
No not suicidal-many years ago I came to the realization that I can only live once for a limited amount of time, but death is forever. Also, as long as I was alive, I always had a choice, but once I was dead, there was no coming back.
About 6 years ago, it was so bad that I stopped sleeping and could not eat, dropping 40 pounds in a matter of weeks. My thoughts were chasing around in my head so much, that I thought I would jump out of the window any second just to make it stop.  Decided to get help. Diagnosed with menopause related depression. Put on Effexor, 75mg. Took about 2 weeks to get used to it. Yes, head in a fog. Eventually things normalized and dosage did not have to be increased.  I was supposed to be on it for about a year, to allow my body time to get used to the changes. After having left the med at work over a long holiday weekend in October, I suffered extreme withdrawal symptoms and decided to stop taking it right then and there. I also found out that it made my cholesterol go from 180 to 260. Which still has not normalized. I was able to get it down in the 230s adding phytosterols, nuts, healthy oils and seaweed. 
Apparently I am in the 8% percent that this happens to when taking Effexor. Unfortunately, this was not in the patient information leaflet. I always read those completely. But the prescribing physician should have seen that in the desk reference and monitored for it. Good thing: was only on it 6 mos."

Recently I was put back on it and had terrible side effects. My eyes dilated and swelled. They became very red after only 2 doses. I was extremely jittery. I felt nothing at all. My family said I was a zombie. I couldn't think or function.
8$Condition: Depression$5/22/2017 4:35:22 PM$Reviewer: nzgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$"I have taken this for 3 months at 150 mg (started on 75 mg and worked up). I have felt a tiny bit better mood wise but the side effects are horrible and not worth it. I wake up 3-4 times a night absolutely drenched in sweat, my bedding is soaked, but I am freezing cold. I feel like I only get about 2 hours sleep with all the waking up and uncomfortableness of sweating. When I do sleep I have terrible nightmares. This is getting worse not better.
I have trouble with body temperature during the day too - I get really hot and feel like I will pass out. Or really cold and just can't get warm for several hours.
I also have terrible nausea that is getting worse, some days it's pretty much constant. 
Other side effects include constipation, headaches, blurred vision and loss of appetite. At the start I also bruised really easily and was pretty much covered in bruises for a few weeks.
Side effects are so awful I am trying to get off this drug, and even after only 3 months, it is proving difficult. I am back down to 75 mg but the side effects are getting worse. I am living on anti-nausea pills!"

Switched Wellbutrin to Effexor. Started at one 37.5 mg cap and now taking 3 caps. I see doc in two weeks. I have some trouble sleeping, but still more awake during day and getting stuff done. Blood pressure was a little higher than normal a few days ago. Constipated for past 2 months so won't know  if Effexor contributes to it. Increased exercise should take care of it and help me lose weight and I'm getting my energy back to do that.

It wasn't really doing anything for my depression,  except I turned into a raving crazy person. I am a teacher, never yelled at my kids until I took this drug! Told my doctor, she doubled the dose! Also, my blood pressure has been consistently high since I started this medication  ( 175/89 to over 210/99). Needless to say I stopped taking it 6 days ago and I feel much better, except for my blood pressure. Now I'm worried about having a stroke.
11$Condition: Depression$9/25/2016 12:37:05 PM$Reviewer: $3$1$2$"There's a reason this doctors refer to this drug as ""side effexor.""  My Dr. didn't advise me of the significant side effects, including flu-like symptoms if you miss as little as one or two doses.  You can feel seriously ill.  I took it for years, and experienced this pretty much every time I forgot a dose.  When I went to a doctor (a different one than the one who prescribed it, since I lost trust in her due to her failure to inform me about the downsides of Effexor) to get off this Rx, I asked her what the worse case scenario would be if I was traveling in a remote area and the Rx was lost/stolen, as I was planning a trip in Africa.  She said I'd be hospitalized.  It took SIX WEEKS to slowly reduce the dosage and gradually get off this Rx.  I needed the doctor's supervision to do it safely.  I would caution anyone considering taking it to research it thoroughly in advance.  If there are other effective options, I would certainly recommend those instead of Effexor, and consider it a drug of last resort.

12$Condition: Depression$6/14/2016 8:03:01 AM$Reviewer: Timofbedlam, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$3$2$"By far the most effective antidepressant I have used, but also with the worst side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
I was prescribed Venlafaxine (aka Effexor) after showing limited response to fluoxetine and trazodone (had previously tried amitriptyline, Seroxat, and dusolepin). Venlafaxine alleviated the worst of my depression and anxiety, and allowed me to start consistently getting more than 2 hours sleep per night, for the first time in months. The doctor gradually raised the dose, and I started getting more sleep and feeling less out of control.
The side effects were unpleasant, but still preferable to depression. My mouth and throat were so dry each morning that I had to down a pint or two of water when I awoke, but just swallowing water was painful on such a parched throat. My sex drive diminished drastically. I was constipated. I sweated excessively, especially at night. Cuts and bruises took many times longer than usual to heal. My dreams were very vivid. After a few months, I developed pain and stiffness in the tendons of my fingers and the backs of my hands, and frequent pain in my shoulder joints: writing, typing and playing guitar all became difficult, but it took me a while to make the connection that the medication was causing me to develop tendonitis.
I weaned myself off as quickly as possible, eventually quitting altogether to avoid the side effects. Withdrawal symptoms included weird electrical twinges in my brain, irritability, severe headaches, severely impaired concentration, and insomnia. I have stayed off it ever since, and the tendonitis cleared up. I don't regret taking Venlafaxine, but wish I had insisted on a lower dose and/or stopped taking it earlier. My emotions were numbed and I'm not sure that they've ever recovered to the pre-Venlafaxine levels, even now several years after quitting.
A useful drug for severe depression when nothing else works, but approach with caution and don't take more than absolutely necessary."

Within 10 hours of taking one pill, I was able to have the most relaxed, intelligent telephone conversion I have had in years. That immpressed me. What didn't impress me was the dilated pupils; the halo's around lights on the tv and at night; the wild light show that appeared when I closed my eyes; the almost instant decrease in my vision; the inability to sleep at night; and the way that my normal food tasted off, it made me loose interest in food, but in just one week taking it I grew in size with water retention. On my Dr's advice I was able to quit cold turkey.
14$Condition: Depression$2/15/2016 10:57:13 PM$Reviewer: Charley, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"Effexor (ER 150mg.) has saved my life. I couldn't have coped with all my life difficulties without it (being a single parent, hyperactive kid, etc.). I used other anti-depressants like Prozac for years, but Effexor is the best, in my experience. The main side effect is constipation, so I have to use Miralax regularly. Another side effect is reduced libido, but I still have plenty of libido. You could say I'm ""addicted"" because if I don't take Effexor everyday, I start to feel very depressed and even physically sick, nauseous, headache. All I know is that it works for my depression, and I thank God it's available. If Effexor is what it takes for me to be normal, then it's a small price to pay."

If I had known it would be this difficult I would have never started taking it. Even if I go down a little bit on it I feel the effects and then I have to go to my normal dose and I feel better. This drug has side effects like sweating which I get and that's one of the reasons I want to get off of it.

After changing to Effexor (not XR) for two months I was worse.  I was weaned off Effexor under a doctor's care and feel so much better.  I have come to realize that it works in the short term (with counseling) but for me should not be taken long term.
21$Condition: Depression$6/2/2014 7:09:26 AM$Reviewer: overcomer1, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Effexor has worked for me every time. Recently I had another episode of depression after a stressful work situation and not pursuing my own goals and hobbies. As it always happens I had forgotten how horrible depression is and I also had some doubts: would Effexor work again? I was very worried for the first two weeks. I read some negative reviews and thought maybe this time the medication would not work. It's part of the disease: we worry too much and expect the worst to happen. Well, I worried in vain: after 4 weeks Effexor kicked in again and I started to feel better, able to work, play, and enjoy life. It's been just over 8 weeks and I feel even better than before I started. About those who complain: there may be some genuine cases when this medication does not work, but in most cases I notice a unfair whining about side effects. I can't understand how can some sweating, nausea or temporary loss of libido compare to the horrible abyss of depression? Well they don't in my case. I have experienced some increased sweating, a bit of nausea for about 2-3 days, and a loss of libido for about 2-3 weeks. But after a matter of weeks the body adjusts and everything is normal. Depression makes us all worry and think negative scenarios. No need to add to that and deter somebody from using a medication that just may work for them. There is hope - whether from this medication or some other treatment. Get well soon everyone and take some action. It's too much I know, but taking the first steps is all that is required.  
22$Condition: Depression$5/11/2014 12:53:35 AM$Reviewer: breadcrumb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$"I took Zolft for 12 years and Paxil for 8 years. Paxil recently started to be less effective for my anxiety and depression, so I was given Effexor as I titrated off of the Paxil. Eventually the Effexor XR was raised to 225 mg per day. At first I thought the effexor would work for me, as my ""old self"" seemed to return. But then I started getting angry and felt intense rage! My personality was changing a LOT and I had suicidal thoughts all the time! I would cry over any little thing and/or get terribly mad! I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown! I went to my healthcare provider and she has now had me start titrating off of the effexor and has added Prozac. I really do not understand why she ever tried me on effexor in the first place!
Today has been my third day without any effexor. I actually made myself skip a week of the titration! Next week was supposed to be the ""stop it completely"" week. I have been sick in bed all day. Diarrhea, some nausea (vomited once), and earlier today I had extreme thirst! 
Anyway, so far I have not had any brain zaps. But I would suggest to anyone considering this drug to weigh all your options. I would never say to someone to never use it though. It has helped some people immensely. As for me, NO!"

You have obviously turned down this path as there was no other option. I know i did, if there was another path i would have chosen it but to get me through depression Effexor has helped me more than any other anti depressant, natural medicine, yoga, exercise or any other crap that has been suggested. Everyone is different and unfortunately people reading this site may be put off by negative views of Effexor. How many people also tried crack and had negative experiences! end of the day Effexor is a drug and if it helps keep me sane and alive then i'll take it. its not forever. Ive weened off before and its not hard if you do it CORRECT! any drug has side effects including cold and flu tabs etc etc
Comparing this drug to Zoloft and Lexapro i have noticed best results. And NO weight gain unlike all the others.
But hey my body is different to any one elses out there so all you can do is trial and error. thats life!
I first experienced anti d's when i was 16 and watched my mum stuggle through cancer...she passed away 4 years later. Losing a loved one was the hardest thing i ever could face in life and found my only saviour was anti depressants. They werent forever, i weened off them 9 years later and remained off them for 2 years. 
I recently re-commenced the tablets as emotions stirred up with a few other life issues so for now im back on them. Its helping me for now and im happy so thats all that matters. Very few side effects for me so im a happy camper!
I would otherwise cry every day and at the drop of the hat. when i commenced the drug i did have increased thoughts of suicide but that has faded.
I can still orgasm lol but never as good drive as previous. I'd rather happiness everyday than a few seconds of pleasure.
Overall dont knock it until you try it.
I could bag Zoloft for making me violently ill but i know others that took it and are happy.
Two sides to a story people!"

Withdrawal effects are horrendous, fever, dizziness, brain zaps, mood swings, rage, crying spells. Nevertheless, Effexor did work for me. It alleviated depression and anxiety quite well. I'm glad I took it. The worst side effect for me was the withdrawal effects that would occur if I didn't take it.  Since weaning from Effexor I have been trying a variety of things to balance my moods including fish oil, vitamins D & B complex, theanine, 5 htp, & melatonin. I am planning to try additional amino acids. See Henry Emmons, The Chemistry of Joy and The Chemistry of Calm, for some ideas.  It has been seven weeks since I discontinued Effexor, and I believe I may be okay without anti-depressants! Take it if you need it, and if you decide to go off it, do not take the process lightly. You will need a long weaning period. Take fish oil, and B-Complex for sure. Good luck.

However I've started to develop food intolerances for the first time in my life about 3 years ago, one of the worst effects being migraine from eating certain foods. 

Recently I experienced serious migraine from eating prawns.  I googled it (as I never had issues before) and to my surprise I found that my 'allergy' was linked to anti-depressants with MAOI (ref: http://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/guide/ty ramine-and-migraines).  The migraine was so severe that I could hardly move, aside from having to vomit or place ice on my head to try alleviate the excruciating pain.

In summary, this is just to send in my observations that the body can develop other problems long after stopping this drug.  Just something to be aware of.

Also heard that food intolerance cases are on the increase, can't help wondering whether it's because more and more people are taking anti-depressants (all things being equal, ie no pre-existing problems with food intolleraces)."

My first attempt at discontinuing the medication resulted in 2 ER visits and 1 five day inpatient stay (worst experience ever). This medication lowers my motivation to press on and succeed in life and at the same time does nothing to help me deal with my anxiety. The drug only helps you care less when you don't succeed or lose something you love. I should have never been prescribed this medication but unfortunately I was and have been taking it at 300mgs per day for 7 years. The problem with caring less is that you let go of things that are important to you and as time passes the worst things become. The combination of the chemical dependency and screwed up life choices this medication promotes makes an impenetrable fortress of misery keeping you on the drug for the rest of your life. Please also consider the affects on your organs (liver) which will make your body sick. The positive reviews sound so fake. People who are depressed do not use exclamation points. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!!!!

I was on Cymbalta for anxiety, depression and neuropathy.  I have been experiencing more and more bouts of depression lately and wonder it if might be because I'm taking the generic version and not the brand name or if perhaps my doctor should increase my dosage or change me back to Cymbalta.  I'll discuss that at my next appt.  Several years ago I tried to commit suicide.  Lately I'm feeling worthless and very sad.  I don't want to go that route again.  I want to be happy I just don't know if it's possible. You see, I've suffered from depression most of my life and it seems perhaps it's just not meant to be.

I haven't noticed a significant improvement in any area, perhaps it's too soon to tell. However I am likely going to switch meds: the side effects are bothering me. Loss of appetite (have lost about ten pounds without intending to or wanting to), integestion that is getting worse, some difficulty n the toilet as well (sorry if tmi).

Depression and anxiety symptoms returned in 2002 and I was prescribed Effexor.  Have been taking it daily since 2002 @ 150mg.  

In the past couple of years I have noticed an increase in side effects; especially the dizziness/lightheaded feeling, blurred vision (especially when working on the computer), and headaches.  

My psychiatrist suspected and confirmed that I have ADD (TOVA testing, plus historical info).  I was possibly misdiagnosed back in 1998 and 2002.  

I want to stop taking the Effexor but it's VERY difficult to stop.  If I miss one day I get extremely dizzy. My psychiatrist wants to establish my ADD medication routine prior to stepping me down on the Effexor.  

I have added Vyvanse to my daily medication.  This seems to be working fine, but not sure the Effexor is doing much except giving me awful side effects.

35$Condition: Depression$3/30/2013 3:05:18 PM$Reviewer: krislic84, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$before you decide to take this medication, THINK AGAIN! This is by far the worst medication I have ever taken in my life (and mind you, I have taken about 5 other anti depressant/anti anxiety meds). Day one, as instructed took 50 mg at bed time. Felt so nauseous, almost puked twice, and had terrible sweating and insomnia. Day two (took 1/4 of a 100 mg pill 4 times throughout the day, in a fog all day, slept all day and all night. couldn't eat, was a mess. Day 3. woke up with head buzzing and felt high as a kite for hours. DID NOT take meds at all. horrible burning in stomach and anxiety at night from not taking, but went away. The side effects alone ruined two days of mine, and left me immobile and bed bound. The fatigue is nothing like I have ever experienced on any other medication. STAY AWAY!
36$Condition: Depression$2/17/2013 11:44:41 AM$Reviewer: georgiapeach, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$No more crying fits. Relaxed but still disinterested in life.  Just want to stay in bed. Used to be almost panic stricken. Not hostile and angry. Lessened appetite and anxiety. No sex drive at age 40 - female. Almost 30 days into treatment and am very hopeful. Have not run out of medicine. Have not tried to change dose or to stop therapy.  I believe that it helps with IBS/constipation.  Not as impulsive. More vivid dreams.  Not consumed with violent/negative thoughts.
37$Condition: Depression$9/28/2012 7:33:17 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$5$"I was on this for about 5 months, although I worked my way up to 300mg pretty quickly. Unfortunately for me, none of the effects really helped me. I think the drug was doing everything it was supposed to do, but I just wasn't the right candidate.

Bad news before the good news:
This drug didn't work or help me, but I think that might be because I have a form of bipolar 2 that is difficult to detect. (I am trying a mood stabilizer now that seems to be helping) Effexor definitely increased my blood pressure, which in turn made me feel dizzy or weak after exerting myself. I was rather flushed on my first couple weeks on the high dose. I didn't sleep well and often felt caffeinated. I seemed to startle much more than usual. 

Good News: From my experience, I can say Effexor was a POWERFUL drug and perhaps a great drug for refractory depression folks. I never experienced any libido problems -- probably difficulty getting off at first, but that issue faded away. I have heard a lot of reviews saying that Effexor is a slow but powerful drug -- it may take up to 8-12 weeks on your target dose to really feel yourself turned around. Anyone trying it right now should have hope, knowing that they are on a beast of an AD.

About the withdrawals: Very little for me! I lucked out considerably. I basically cut it off very quickly, knowing that the drug was probably more bad than good for me. I got a few ""shocks"", but not painful, just weird. They were gone in a couple weeks."

I was suicidal before taking this med. I occansionally still have a couple of ""down"" days a month. Usually right before my period. The doctor has said it is because my hhormones are out of whack at that point of the month. I am not suicidal anymore. The did have to up my dosage because a lower dosage was not working. Once the doubled the dosage it seems to be working just fine. I am taking 150mg twice a day now. That is a high dosage to be on. It took about 3 months before the med starting working. "

Felt like I was getting a horrible case of ""flu"" if I was late with a dose. I developed prolonged QT syndrome on it. I am now trying to get off it.I decreased by 37.5 mg a week for 5 weeks. Became very ill with dizziness, headaches, nausea/vomiting, and ""brain zaps"" I call them. It feels like an electrical current zapping through your brain. They are horrible. Now I'm down to 1/4 of a 37.5 mg tab every 48 hours and trying to eliminate that does. Currently, I'm at 71 hours since last 1/4 tab dose and today has been awful! 
Besides, it totally took away my sex drive. 
If I would have known about these withdrawal symptoms, I would NEVER HAVE STARTED IT!! DO NOT START THIS MEDICATION IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE AT ALL!!!

It did help me in the beginning, but it is damn near impossible to get off this medication. I started at 250 and was a freaking zombie for two years, finally went down to 150 and had severe withdrawal symptoms. Extremely painful brain zaps, horrible headache, sweating like crazy, terrible nightmares! I finally adjusted to 150 and have been trying to taper down from that for the last 2 months. I am now at 35 mg and can't seem to move down any more. It is a freaking nightmare being on this drug. I don't believe in lawsuits but if I had the money I'd sue Wyeth pharma if I could!!!

Wish I would have read reviews before starting it. It has really helped me with everyday life, feel much better about myself and just take things as they come to me, no big deal. But if I should miss a dose, or even a little late, it does things to my body that I just can't explain. Kind of feels like having the flu. And I get these like electical zapps through out my body. I know if I should ever decide to stop taking it, it will be pure hell getting off of it. My advice is to avoid this med and hopefully there is something else out there that will help. Also advise researching before starting any drugs. Like I said, had I done some research about Effexor prior to starting it, I would not have ever started it.

I didn't get help until I was 14, big mistake. I took Prozac 40mg first but the doctor found it was ineffective although I am telling her it is working fine. She changes me o 75mg of Effexor. I took it for a month and had severe nausea. When I switched doctors I later found out the doctor that prescribed Effexor didn't prescribe it correctly. The immediate release tablets are meant to be taken 3 times a day and I was taking it once a day basically making the pill useless. I am back on the Prozac now and the side effects are much more tolerable. I just wonder how this drug would have effected me if I took the extended release version. But all in all, I just couldn't handle the severe nausea every time I took it.

So worth it to me. I did not find that it made me gain weight as much as other drugs, but that has a direct correlation to my level of activity too. for more than one reason, i am not excited about having to ween off of it when i get pregnant. i do plan on taking it again, if needed, once i can again.

Ultimately, I began feeling jittery and had trouble getting a good night's sleep.  2. Even the generic of this drug can be extremely expensive.  3. When trying to discontinue the Effexor, I experienced nausea, diarrhea, and episodes of rapid heartbeat for weeks.  

I'm switching back to an SSRI, but NOT Paxil.  It caused weight gain.  Meanwhile, it's still not totally understood why the same drug can affect different people in such a variety of ways. Thus, finding a ""perfect fit"" may take some unpleasant trial and error.  (When it came to Paxil, the perfect fit certainly didn't extend to my skinny jeans!)  How convenient for physicians to have us available as experimental rats...

At first, I thought it was a miracle cure...my depression was cured and I lost a lot of weight!!!  As time went by it was less and less effective.  When the decison was made to change meds I could not get off of it!  I went thru the proper procedure to wean myself off and, of course, i was doing so per my doctor's instructions, but the withdrawals were unbearable!  It was like my brain was scrambled!  I couldnt make ANY decisions!  If someone asked me if I wanted coke or pepsi I was not capable of deciding.  After much agony I finally got thru it and was put on Lexapro.  Lexapro is not nearly as helpful as Effexor was, but I can go for several days without Lexapro and still function normally.  I'm not sure what the deal with Effexor is, but it's a real shame because it was very effective for a long while.

Effexor was slowly poisoning me...I had extreme asthenia(fatigue, weakness of body, lack of strength and energy). To top it off my psychiatrist would not listen to me or take my complaints seriously!! Eventually I had the courage to see just a GP. I now take 10mg of Cipralex and I have my life back!! I almost lost everything - my life, my husband and my children. 

Effexor can be a dangerous drug...be very careful of it!!"

I worked ok, but I had the strangest sensations visually.  If I turned on a bright light first thing in the morning, I would see streaks of light.  I had terrible vivid mixed up dreams that left me tired in the morning.  I developed double vision and the eye Dr. couldn't find a real cause.  I stopped Effexor and went on Celexa and my vision corrected itself.  Not sure if Effexor caused it, but won't take a chance again.

I started with 37.5mg and after a life trauma, my doctor increased the dosage to 300mg.  I have tried many times to reduce the dosage but my doctor insists that I take a medium dose.  He pisses me off because he has never suggested counseling.  The biggest side effect I wish to share are the frightful, colorful, detailed nightmares.  If I miss one dose, my dreams are so very realistic.  People I have known and know now are part of my dream.  Situations with these people where I feel that things were unresolved or I cause negativity in our lives are animated so clearly in these dreams.  Sometimes I purposely don't take this medicine to see what I will dream next because I remember everything.

I started with 75mg and now take 225mg daily.  It is very effective in regards to controlling my depression, but there are negatives too.  I have gained over 50 pounds while taking Effexor and my sex drive is nearly nonexistent.  I forget things often and my family notices this.  I cannot remember the last time I cried. It is great to feel like I can cope with life, but I do not like the extra weight.

Am now back to the 75 per day, but still battle with depression.  Am hesitant to add any more meds to my life.  Started this drug in the wake of breast cancer (chemo, radiation and after-effects) 3 years ago, in conjunction with Ativan (for anxiety) and Neurontin (for extreme neuropathy).  Have completely eliminated Ativan and Neurontin, but feel like something is missing...  Following up with doctors on correct dosage is very difficult (depressing!).

I experienced constant shaking of my hands, cold clammy sweats whenever I would exert myself, profound lethargy, confusion, worsening of depression. I felt like I was going mad. I was so nauseous during the day that I could only eat late at night and gained about 20 pounds. After three months of ""sticking with it"" I called my doctor about the side effects. She told me to quit cold turkey. After three days of feeling like I was about to have a seizure I sought a second opinion and was put back on the drug with a plan to get off of it completely. I am now down to 37.5 mgs and am feeling much better but am looking forward to being off completely. I would recommend seeing a psychiatrist to be prescribed this drug.

I tried several: Zoloft, Lexapro, and I can't remember the others. A friend recommended I try Effexor XR (75 mg.), so I did. At one point (a couple of yrs. ago), I felt better & weaned myself off of the 75 mg. by taking it every other day for a week or 2. I had no problems with stopping Effexor. However, something else happened (I can't remember exactly what),& I felt I needed to start back on Effexor again. I'm tired all the time, and I DO have some weird dreams & flashbacks to dreams when I am awake during the day. I usually drink red wine every evening, so that may also have an adverse effect!

Began at the 75mg level at the age of 18 and switched to 150mg after a year. Recently switched to the regular from the extended release due to my insurance. 

This medicine has been amazing for me. I used to experience severe mood swings, anger and anxiety. The only side effects I have are vivid nightmares on occasion and I bruise very easily. I did take this drug with both pregnancies due to the fact that the benefits outweighed the consquences and at the time not much was known about the effects Effexor has on pregnancy. My boys were perfectly healthy and happy. 

I have tried to go off of Effexor a couple times working with my doctor. I was weaned off and put on another medication over a few months. The withdrawl and side effects were horrid. I had severe anxiety to the point I felt like my insides were shaking. I had flu-like symptoms and felt like my head was in a cloud. The anger was the worst. I was full of rage for no reason and was extremely mean. I can't say for sure my symptoms were caused from withdrawl or were from my depression. 

I would highly recommend this medicine if you truly need it but be very careful and research the side effects. Plan on being this medicine forever once you begin."

You dont get warnings on this before taking this drug.  Look/google it up and read the horror stories before you decide to take this drug... You will be sooooo sick no matter what when you try to get off this drug.....tons of people can not get off because of how bad the withdrawl is.  You just can not function...You are to ill to move, you get so dizzy you vomit, you get weird brain zapping feelings, you cant concentrate, I was afraid to drive it was so bad and so on... #2 Now being off this drug and the side effects slowing  I feel so alive, motivated, happy,I can finally poop like normal and sex !! Being on Effexor you might as well forget sex... I forgot how fun it was (lol). I had no idea what this drug did to me, looking back just a month later and how I feel now,,,,Was I a walking zombie?...I dont know but Im so happy to be off it....I would not recommend Effexor to anyone!!!

Now I just take both at night.  I frequently have very vivid dreams, and sometimes I can't remember if I dreamt something or if it really happened.  I had brain zaps when I first started and as I increased the dosage, but those have mostly stopped.  But my moods are definitely better overall and my depression has lessened.

Xanax - a calmer - is so nice, but unfortunately docs fear its addictiveness and it treats anxiety but not depression (unless the depression is caused by anxiety). 

The nice thing about Effexor: it covers both of my symptoms - depression and anxiety. I have gained about 50 pounds, however, which has been consistent in the past 14 years since I started it. 

You definitely will know if you miss a dose as you will have waves moving through your head and feelings of detachment from reality. This scares me as I'm sure it will affect tapering off, which I hear isn't easy to do. It's a powerful drug and can be very effective. But, you have to be strongly committed to sticking with it. It takes weeks to kick in and you can't stop taking it abruptly. Also you must be sure to not miss doses or you will suffer extreme side effects as your brain tries to adjust to life without the chemicals it craves. 

I had weird intense dreams before starting Effexor but they have become even more extreme on it. Be ready for that. The dreams will intensify your psychological conflicts."

Nausea went away after a short time.  Sweating still bad and libido very low.  I have to stop though, because my cholesterol has gone from 135 to 295.  If you are using Effexor, monitor this.  It is rare, but can happen.
141$Condition: Depression$1/25/2010 12:05:25 PM$Reviewer: chick4troy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$Effexor has been helpful!  I do experience night sweats & occasional upset stomach but nothing severe. The dizziness is most prevalent and the reason I looked @ reviews to see if anyone else was experiencing the same.  The 1st few weeks I noticed a decrease in appetite but that went away (unfortunately) :o)  If anything, I don't gain weight but have trouble LOOSING it.  The best thing to report is that I have not experienced any SEXUAL side effects as with other meds! I initially began taking depression meds for anxiety/short fuse/easily frustrated & feelings of being let down. Through the course of taking meds I became depressed instead of anxious. Lexapro wasn't quite enough for me, Zoloft was TOO much & Lorazapam was just a quick fix. Effexor has been good for me but I wonder if it's effectiveness will wear off over time as other meds have. From reading reviews, it seems that this med is NOT for EVERYONE. I would try it ONLY after other common meds have failed you.

My weight gain has been beyond disheartening.  My doctor said she purposefully put me on this because of the side-effects (nausea, headaches, diarrhea, etc.) so I would not try to quit or wean myself off due to this commonly happening when people start to feel better or think they no longer need it.  She'll help wean me when WE feel the med is no longer needed.  
Counseling/therapy is also important since depression is due to life issues, both conscious and unconscious,that have gone unresolved.  Thank God for meds and my psychiatrist!  (Just wish the weight would come off with exercise.)

It helped somewhat but I would still go through bouts of depression.  Once I retired from the military, my new family doctor started prescribing 75mg of Effexor to me.  I have been taking Effexor now for nine years and am quite happy with it.  I rarely suffer from depression now and am much happier with life.  The only side effects I have are if I run out of my prescription and have to wait for more.  I start feeling ""waves"" of nausea and also feel unbalanced.  I cannot function well in normal activities such as driving and cannot concentrate well on work.  Needless to say, there is a degree of dependency on Effexor.  For those that are uncomfortable with feeling dependent on a drug than Effexor is not for you.  For me, getting rid of the feelings of hopelessness and self-pity have made Effexor the antidepressant drug of choice.   "

I have been a long term pain person, taking ten meds a day, and getting damn tired of doing it. The chore itself was dragging me down, heading to the med chest over and over and over. Combined with low testosterone and having to slather myself with gel daily to get that up, also became part of this nuiscence. So, I asked for something and this was it. Now, I am la di da over most things, while my wife weighs the pros and cons of various things, I simply just go about it all with out too much of a care. I am taking 37.5 2x a day. Is this worth the garbage you must endur to get off of it? I guess I will let you know, as I already have an issue with dizzyness and a whooshing as I turn my head quickly, like to see if a car is coming as I enter the highway. That is being teated by a CT scan of my head and a neurologist and Prednosone. Ho, will he be surprised this could be the culprit! So I will go with half the drug for two weeks, then off we go.

I have a sence of changing the things that I can and leaving the rest to GOD.  I will take the rest of my life.  Very thankful I was prescribed the drug.  I fell like I am forty.

This is the second time I have been prescribed effexor and am due to come off the drug very soon. I am terrified of the withdrawal effects this drug has. Having come off effexor before, I know exactly what I am in for, withdrawal fom this is horrendous. Even reducing the dose very slowly over a matter of months is horrible, the slightest change in dosage effects you. Dizzieness, nausea, shooting pains, confusion, those are just to name a few. Effexor, did and has worked for my depression on two occassions, but never ever again will I take this drug, to be honest, i'd rather poke sticks in mye eyes than go through the debilitating withdrawal this drug give you. It should seriously be banned.

About 8 months into the treatment I would awaken everyday with feelings of hopelessness and a wish to simply not exist. The doctors said I needed to see a psychiatrist and get treatment for this severe depression. I tried several anti-depressants including Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft with no success. I finally tried Effexor and it worked! I lost the feelings of hopelessness, I found I was able to smile, I regained some energy and generally felt better. At the end of the HEP C treatment I stopped the Effexor treatment also but after a couple of months the depression returned and was quite disabling. I ended up taking Effexor again and the depression subsided. I have been taking Effexor in doses of 150 mg to 225 mg for the past 5 years and have been able to return to work, enjoy my family and life in general. If I stop taking the Effexor I find myself slipping back into depression after just a few days. I am taking the time to write this to provide a note of encouragement to people who have not found a way out of their depression. As I said, I had to try several before I found something that worked but I kept trying. I also use diet and exercise and therapy and prayer and meditation. I need them all to stay in the light. I still have days when I awaken with my head in a negative space but with the help of the medicine, doctors and prayer and helping other people worse off than I am I find life is usually pretty good and often downright great!

It is impairative that anyone thinking of stopping this drug do it correctly and under the close supervision of thier doctor. The symptoms are no joke, I felt like a junkie going through detox!

I have been on several others with limited effectiveness or none at all.  Then I was prescribed Effexor and in light of my past drugs I am very happy with it.  If I go off of it within a few weeks I am back in the mental mud bog and sinking. I am now very sure to have enough effexor on hand.  I still get depressed and most people that I know do.  However, now my depression is about something that I can work through but, I never want to be without the effexor.  I don't think that there is any medication that can work 100% 24/7.  Compared to the person that just sat on the couch in front of the TV and drink or sleep much of the time.  I find it a blessing no matter what anyone says (Mr. Cruse) it has helped me so much.  I actually can plan for something or get excited about something or just go out to be out.  Before I was in front of the TV sucking down 2 six packs a day and sleeping the rest of the day and not to mention my anger.  My depression has had an effect on riends and family or just meeting someone.  So, you can jump on a couch or tell me that I am brain washed and I'll tell you that I am better off today than before I started effexor.  People tell me that I am a different person and I actually choose to help people with their depression because of what I have gone through.  I'm not a doctor but, my exeriance has helped other people.  I now think positive thoughts instead of negative ones.  So, MAKE TODAY THE VERY BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE.
228$Condition: Depression$3/4/2008 8:36:57 PM$Reviewer: persephone, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Basically, this drug has helped change my life. I've had problems with recurring major depressive disorder for as long as I can remember, but it took one really bad episode in my adulthood to make me consider taking an antidepressant.

I have to say, taking the meds in combination with talk therapy has improved the quality of my life beyond measure.

Most of the complaints people have here are about weight gain, decreased libido and withdrawal effects.

My weight gain started before taking Effexor, so I can't blame it on that - I know it was due to a lifestyle change. I had decreased libido for about 6 months, but then it returned back to normal.

And FYI - you're going to have withdrawal effects when you stop taking any antidepressant. The key is to taper off slooooooowly and with the supervision of your doctor. 

Not everyone needs to take Effexor (or any antidepressant) forever, but for me - as long as it keeps me in remission, I'm a happy camper."

I am now taking some OTC items which are helping tremendously. I saw that some people trying to escape the Effexor demon were taking fish oil supplements and multivitamin/minerals, so I'm now taking Organic Flaxseed Oil and a Mega Vitamin/Mineral Complex with an additional boost of B-Complex Vitamins which I purchase cheaply with very low shipping costs from http://www.VitaCost.com. Some treatment programs are stating that with the depletion of antioxidants, one needs to add a product such as gluathione supplementation. This is also available from VitaCost very cheaply. I've added another super antioxidant, Acai pure freeze-dried pure organic powder from Amazon Thunder, the provider of Acai for the Oprah Show documentary. I take my scoopful daily in juice, but some people like it in applesauce, yogurt, etc. It has no sugar added and is completely organic. It's available from http://www.amazonthunder.com/members/coonmartranc h. I've been using these dietary boosters during the entire time and will continue to do so for several months after I'm completely off the Effexor as my withdrawal symptoms have been minimal. Let me know if this suggestion helps or not. Best wishes.........

My doctor did not explain the side effects associated with discontinuing the medication.  I haven't experienced any of those side effects because I still take Effexor, but I'm worried about how it will be when I come off.  Ultimately, this drug saved my marriage, but I do not feel 100% myself.

    I was prescribed this drug when I was in sixth grade (six years ago), and it has been a bumpy road of on and off ever since. 

    When I was first prescribed, I was on a small dose. However eventually I would out-grow that dose and once again feel my general sings of: Nervousness, Anxiety, and my tourettic body maneuvers would return. 

     However after a while on this prescription, like all patients of this drug, I was slowly becoming addicted. This meant that, If I didn't take my prescribed dose once, It didn't matter If it was only one dose, or even if it was an unnoticed accident, before long I would be stumbling around like a drunk, I would have a headache so splitting that if I turned my head too fast it would feel like the blood in my skull was in a centrifuge on full turn. Not too mention my appetite would be lost, mostly because of the low-aching-numbness in my gut that nulled out all satisfactory feelings for food. Also there was muscle cramping. Normally you only feel a muscle cramp of this caliber if you just ran a couple-non-stop laps around a track and stopped to touch your toes, however this was not the case, My tendons, thighs, and even hands would go as far as to ""lock up"" if even given the mundane task of bending down to tie my shoes.

     However the effects while taking the drug could be even worse. For one I was so fatigued that I would be going to bed at 8:30 pm and still be exhausted at 6:00. Also weight gain, the extent of the weight gain was so massive that now, that I am attempting to cleanse the drug from my system( I've been clean about a week and lived with negative side effects every day since) but the weight gain was so massive that once I limited my intake of the drug, 
I was beginning to add new notches to shrink my belt every-so-few days. Not only has my 
weight gone down but I am actually able to 
stay awake.

    In the end all I am saying is, the choice is yours. Choose right.   "

I really thought I was losing my mind or had a brain tumor--honestly.  I finally figured out that when I missed my meds (usually on weekends) I experienced the mess I mentioned above.

When my husband treatened my life I was unable to react with anger and so was put into a dangerous situation.  But I would not quit taking effexor.  It has helped me more than it has caused problems.

311$Condition: Depression$10/1/2007 2:03:13 PM$Reviewer:  Jason, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$My Dr. had placed me on this, because I said I was going to kill myself, but in reality I didn't think I was ever going to get out of rehab after my car accident. They were just words and I got out of rehab a little over a week later. I was just in rehab for 5 months and I wanted to get out so I could finish school so I didn't have to repeat a year. 1) I shouldn't have said what I did 2) He should have listened when I told him I was just saying that 3) The drug messed with my head. I took myself off of it with no side effects. I do know I'm thrilled that I'm off it now, and have never been happier, even though I still had to repeat a year...

313$Condition: Depression$9/24/2007 7:00:31 PM$Reviewer: Nan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My doctor has me taking 75mg/day, alternating with 150mg/day (1 pill odd days, two pills even days).  I have had no problems, and my depression is under control.  When I began to take the 2nd pill, however, I developed a rash on my face from the moisterizer I have been using for years. It has vitamins C and E in it.  The rash took almost a week to go away, and when I tested the cream a few weeks later, I had the same rash.  I changed moisterizers and have had no other problems.
