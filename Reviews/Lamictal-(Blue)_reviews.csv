0$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/14/2017 4:11:18 AM$Reviewer: Nightingale_Cross, 35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on this medicine for over 5 years.  It has been so successful that all of my other medications are designed around it.  I will NOT stop taking it.  It's quieted my mind, slowed racing thoughts, no more songs stuck in my head for weeks.  I do take this with another mood stabilizer but I've been on this one much longer.  I couldn't function without it.  I've recommended it to family and a few other people.  All have had good experiences. When I started taking this medicine I, and others around me, noticed a real difference in my personality and my moods.  This is the first medicine to make me feel human again.  I love it.
1$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/6/2011 9:46:55 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female $1$1$1$This medication almost killed me! I went into spasms, no control over my body at time, blured vision, milgraines, rash, congestion, sweeled up my whole body, body stiffness to the point of imobility, and ultimatly almost died within a 72 hr window! This drug should be banned! Don't use it!
2$Condition: Simple Partial Seizures$2/25/2011 7:13:23 PM$Reviewer: jad6161, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$My 6 yr old son has hemi-paritic CP and seizures caused by underdevelopment of his brain due to an inter-uterine stroke.  At age 8 mos we 1st saw him seize and his condition was diagnosed (although I noticed weakness in his right limbs from birth).  He was first put on phenobarbitol.  That worked for about 12 mos.  Then triliptal for abt a yr.  Then we did the Ketogenic Diet for 6 mos.  It stopped the seizures very well!, but was difficult to maintain.  After a cpl yrs of no meds he started having seizures again. Zonisamide worked for about a yr before more break-through seizures started.  Now we give him 50 mg Lamictal morning and night along with 200 mg Zonisamide with 10 ml liquid melatonin at night.  So far it's going good.  Only 2 seizures since we started Lamictal and they were unusually mild and easy to stop. SUCCESS!!  Our Pediatric neurologist warned us of the allergic reaction and b/cuz of that we've built up to this dose very slowly and will continue til we reach the therapeutic dose, then hopefully ween him off the Zonisamide which we suspect is causing aggressive behavior, especially at school.  I wonder however, if my son's apparent inability to keep his hands to himself may be a symptom of ADD or ADHD (both of his parents, his brothers, and many of his aunts and uncles have ADD/ADHD).  That aside, lamictal seems to be working well for him right now.

5$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/5/2009 6:48:24 PM$Reviewer: bngr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$i had side effects from this medicine that dr's wanted to call the flu,nuemonia and a sinus cold.i had rapid heart rate that went from 115 to 142 from just standing up not even taking a step.i was tired,very fatigued,i lost 42 lbs,but no loss of appetite,i could not write i was so shakey, i think my nervous system was damged in the process because ever since then i have been having a lot of problems with going into the public and trouble with shaking in my hands.so if the doc says you have a sinus infection that dont go away,thats where it starts.
6$Condition: Manic-Depression$1/3/2009 9:35:22 PM$Reviewer: Knowledgeofmynamedoesn&#39;tmattermyhopedoes, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$4$"I am a 15 year-old boy currently taking 2; 100 mg tabs of Lamotrigine (Lamictal) a day. My symptoms are as followed;
-complusive behavior has increased
 i.e. obsessively rethinking my thoughts of things I have problems with, things I have to accomplish, things I want to remember, and what I feel I need to say to others.
-More apt to become instantly frustrated and angry at the person/or persons I have a difficulty with.
-Depression symptoms have increased drastically. Although suicidal behavior is almost non-existant (due to the many 'eye-opening' hospitalization experiences)
 i.e. When upset, I cry intensly and obsessively think of my problems. These emotions seem to be short-lived and change surprisingly often. (Currently, I am undignosed with neither Bi-polar (manic-depression) or any other anger problems. I am dignosed with ADHD and a severe manic- depression disorder. I show traits of Borderline and Histrionic Personality disorders. my Doctors seems to be stumpted on what to do, seeing as I've been on just about every medication. So we're trying one of our last hopes, Lamictal.)
-My mood seems to be de-stablizing as I continue to take Lamictal. I dont Know whether or not it has anything to do with the concerta I recently started but my advice, If it means much coming from a very emotionally conflicted teen-age boy, but I advise great caution when taking this medication, especially when starting it. Severe side effects can occur. It is a anti-seizure medication, newly used as a mood-stablizer medication. Obviously you have to be carefully prescribed this medication by a professional, and you cannot miss doses. It can directly affect your circulatory and heart (cardio) systems.  
I highly recommend talking to your doctor, as I have an appointment next week. Im going to tell my doctor all of my symptoms, and so should you. If you are having negative symptoms with this medication. DO NOT give up hope on recovery, for I WILL NOT.

7$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/12/2008 8:19:17 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$4$Placed on Lamictal for treatment of symptoms of Bipolar, and did see some changes, mainly in aggressive behavioral and quick to react to threatening situations. Insurance suggested a generic, and the first time I took the generic I started loosening my balance, dizziness and degrading concentration. Symptoms repeated the next day as I was asked to again see if I was reacting to the generic. Returned to the non-generic and symptoms never returned. Now insurance company refuses to pay for non-generic drug. What’s a person to do?
