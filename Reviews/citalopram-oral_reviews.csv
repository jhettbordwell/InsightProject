1$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/2/2019 9:03:25 PM$Reviewer: MyLife, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$On and off, Mostly on for 3 or so years. 1stly, effects were noticed by others before noticed by myself. Weight loss due to loss of appetite and then mild weight gain once I started feeling a little more care free. This 'drug' definitely helped with my anxiety. It made me overall very positive. Not 100% better but way more bearable. Helped with getting angry. All was great until I started to continuously notice this lack of empathy, cloudiness In what felt like my frontal lobe, my sex drive severely dropped, and then this major suicidal depression came like a freight train for some reason. Honestly It bummed me out but I knew getting off it was for the better. Now that I have been off of it for a few months, I like the natural feeling better. I think. My anxiety is back but I feel like I can deal with it better. My thoughts come easier. My memory is better.. It feels more 'real.'  However I still have a depressing cloud that lingers over me But SO much better then what was happening to me towards the end. I miss not getting angry so easy and the ease of having positive thoughts. However Im hoping that this experience has helped me learn how to balance things on my own without the help of a prescription. Overall it 'worked great,' My dosage might have needed to be changed. It could be the stressful but Im confident that being off medication is more the type of life I wanna live. 
2$Condition: Depression$9/5/2019 9:38:46 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$"My doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram for depression.  After a few weeks, there was some improvement, but I felt the drug helped my anxiety more than the depression.  The dose was increased to 40mg.  Still felt ""lopsided"", in that the anxiety was under control but not the depression.  This drug clouded my judgement, as I said some things and felt like I put my foot in my mouth!  Very embarrassing! I mentioned these things to my doctor.  She said Citalopram is more for anxiety than it is for depression. My doctor switched me to another drug, which is helping alot."

16$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$7/28/2018 4:10:34 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$5$3$I am somewhat happy with the medication Citalopram HBR 20MG which I have recently been increased to 30MGs. I used to work in corrections, but now work as a security officer. However, whilst working security March 15, 2015 in an apartment complex, I was lured into the parkade due to a fire alarm where 6 men were waiting for Me. I have since suffered from night terrors, but refused to be a victim so I returned to work for 1 year, then the depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts came. Workers comp had Me see a PTSD Psychologist right after the attack for 2 visits, then had Me see him again. He diagnosed Me with delayed onset post traumatic stress, however WCB will only look at the physical aspects of the attack, not the psychological ones. I have now voluntarily been admitted to the psych ward due to wanting to end My life and the Psychiatrist here has put Me on Citalopram. The night terrors have not stopped at all, but I've learned a new coping method by looking for something particular in the room (like My chair) as a grounding to let Me know that I am not at work and the attack is not real. Since taking the 30 Mg of Citalopram the thoughts of ending my life have ceased greatly. Iind myself a lot happier, yet am tired more.

I couldn't sleep or eat, and I essentially went ""down the rabbit hole"" and couldn't get out. I was a total wreck and had an extremely difficult time working and doing general tasks. My doctor put me on a new drug (at that time): Celexa. It wasn't long and I began sleeping well and functioning better. After 3 months, I was able to get off of them. I haven't had the need to take anti-depressants since that time. I highly recommend it... it definitely worked for me!"

When I commented to my md about how I felt about Citalopram, he said ""it's like somebody hit the pause button"" just long enough to let it bounce off you."

The first couple of weeks on the drug were difficult, but it was nothing I couldn't deal with. I yawned a lot, felt less inhibited, and a tiny bit dizzy.

After the side effects wore off, and making sure I took my medication everyday, I can now say I feel much better.

At first I was reluctant to take Citalopram, but I know I needed that extra bit of help. It's not a magic wand, or a wonder drug, but it has helped me to help myself."

If I take too large of a dose I end of tired and unfocused.  I end up cutting the pills to a 1mg dose and at that level I can tolerate the side effects and still benefit from the drug.  Unfortunately, even at this trivial dose I have a significant sexual side effect.  At times I've stopped the drug for months and the side effect still remains, I fear it may have become permanent.  Now I need to go back on the med, but I'm hesitant because I'm so worried about this side effect.

I was barely able to function. It worked at 10mg for a while, then once my baby was born, my dosage was increased to 20mg. I continued to take that dosage for about 2 years until I finally told my doctor that I don't notice a difference in my life and she then upped the dosage to 40mg. Now, I experience anxiety worse than before, along with insomnia and zero sexual interest. My husband and I have not been intimate in 6 months because of this. I see a new doctor next week and I honestly can't wait to try something different.

With any medication there are side effects. I am so anti medication and tried herbal or alternative medication. However with severe anxiety and depression this medication has helped me get back on track in life. I was very anxious about taking the medication but now I am taking it I wish I'd done it sooner. You do need to be patient to see results and also tolerate the side effects because in the long run the benefit of this medicine outweighs the minor side effects. It works for me but maybe not for everyone, however it's worth a try as doctors wouldn't prescribe something without benefiting you and making you better.

Unfortunately, it did very little for my OCD, and I did not notice much benifit from citalopram for OCD. It helped the suicidal tendancies a little bit, but not very much. I took 40mg once per day. Personally, I think this tablet is more for anxiety more than anything else. People with generalised anxiety disorder would probably benefit best from this tablet, but everyone is different.
The side-effects I had were increased sweating, sleepiness, increased salivation, memory problems, strange dreams, tiredness, trembling, and yawning. These side-effects lasted about 5 - 10 days, then they went, except for the strange dreams, that lasted about 4 months, which I loved. The dreams that citalopram caused me made me look forward to going to bed. To be honest, citalopram was a good tablet, just not quite strong enough."

I started at 10mg, then uped to 20mg which is what my dr recommended me at. I have had severe depression since before I hit puberty and am now 24, almost 25 (I hit puberty at around 9-10). I suffered through my entire per-adult life and well into the beginning of it. I finally took control iPad started this medication. Talking therapy didn't work. Everything I tried didn't work. Finally, after about 6-8 months on this medication (yes really) I feel fantastic. I've never been happier. I don't remember feeling this great. Its like I actually see colors again. I'm trying to stop this medication now, since I think I can finally deal without it (it's been Bout a year) and I'm having a bit of a difficult time with it though. I'm still feeling good but I get crazy moody bouts of ANGER. I have really no reason to be angry but everything is just enraging!! It's very frustrating. I hope it goes away soon but I would recommend quitting the meds as SLOWLY as possible to fight the mood swings. I had no real side affects on this medication except for craving for sweets and a harder time to orgasm (but when I did it was awesome lol).

I then started to have consistent very vivid (nightmarish) dreams.  Fortunately this lasted 2weeks.  Id also wake up tired and take a while to get into my day.  I was crabby and could get annoyed very easily, then Id be happy and spritely by midmorning. I went back to the docs again.  This time he said, take 1/2 a tab in the morning.  I did this for about 4-6weeks and noticed that this was helpful.  Although, I could feel in my body when the 24hours was up as I begin to have blurriness and feel lethargic mentally.  I went back to my doc for a last time who said, ok, change to 1/2 a tab at night. I have been on half a tab for the past year now. (weight is 52-58kg.  fluctuates.

I highly recommend this anti-depressant for depression sufferers. 

I have never felt so normal in such a long time. But I developed a weird sleep problem. I'd sleep 14 hours a night. I couldn't get out of bed otherwise. I don't know if it's my condition or if it was Cipralex. 

I could only fully and actively function for a good 2-3 hours each day. Other times, I was sleepy and tired. Just constantly fatigued. 

I talked to my doctor about trying Prozac and he thought it was a good experiment. But I'm very hesitant after seeing the plentiful terrible reviews on WebMD of Prozac. 

Maybe I should stick with this sleeping problem than risk all of those seemingly commonly experienced side effects."

Any who, I stopped taking the Citalopram after week 3 (and a 1/2) and went back to Cymbalta. My reasons for the switch are this. #1 I became increasingly forgetful or would blank out very important work details. Not like me at all to forget jobs! #2 I started to have involuntary muscle tightening. #3 I yawned uncontrollably at times. Other than those problems it did help my anxiety but it was not the answer for me. I was able to work through the sleeplessness at early morning Hours I had listed in my first review and noticed no other side effect. But the ones I did experience were unacceptable. So I guess I will shell out the big bucks for the med that is right for me. "

128$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/5/2014 10:20:59 AM$Reviewer: Kat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I was on Cymbalta several years ago for depression and anxiety due to life experiences and I felt as I should. I felt ok, still with emotion but ok and not overwhelmed. I moved to a new state 7 years ago and could not afford my med for a very long time due to layoffs, no insurance, etc. I have recently been able to go back and restart on Citalopram after realizing that I still suffer from anxiety, occasional panic attacks, slight depression and irritability. I am only on day 3...... Day 1; Took 20mg on Friday night before bed, woke up at 3am and could not get back to sleep (this to me is very upsetting because I have struggled for the last few years with sleep issues and recently purchased a new tempurpedic mattress that has totally fixed that problem, now I'm back to not sleeping all night)  I was lethargic and made very deliberate and slow moves all day, although I felt fine. Day 2; Same problem after taking it at night woke up between 3 and 5 AM and could not get back to sleep. The rest of the day however, I felt just fine, no more grogginess just normal. Day 3; Woke up again at 4/5 am but had taken a melatonin before I went to bed and I was able to fall back asleep. Tonight,  I will be taking the melatonin earlier this evening and my 20mg Citalopram right before I close my eyes! So far I feel fine except I did realize when I drink coffee on an empty stomach I get very tired and once I eat I fell fine again. I haven't had any major irritability, stress or anxiety since taking this but still a few weird and uncomfortable thoughts, which is mild for my incredibly over active brain. I am also having hot/cold flashes but it isn't that bothersome. So far, so good.  It has also completely curbed my nicotine urge which is fantastic since I was on my 11 attempt to quit. I absolutely need more time to see if this med follows through or falls short and will revisit my review in another 3 weeks.

It didn't help as much as he said it would but it did help a bit.  I would say it made me more balanced.  It didn't exactly make me happy but it took most of my bad thoughts away.  I didn't want to be stuck taking a medication the rest of my life so I stopped taking it to see if I could do without.  Bad idea.  Terrible side effects for 2-3 weeks.  I was dizzy the whole time and got headaches. Not to mention the bad episodes were back.  After the dreaded few weeks the side effects went away but I was still sad.  So finally 6months later I saw a new Dr. who just put me on 20mg Prozac, I'm sure it will be like the same thing.

I worried so much that I couldn't enjoy life because I was too busy worrying about what horrible thing might be getting ready to happen.  I would have panic attacks at night that were so bad it felt as if I was on fire, the day time panic attacks were not as bad as the ones at night, but still were bad enough.  I'm not really sure why I was hesitant to take something, but my doctor told me all this medicine would do is turn off the noise in my head.  I started out on 10 mg, then changed to 20 mg after a week.  I could tell a difference in that I wasn't worrying as much, but the anxiety was still there lurking, and still bad at night.  He increased my dosage to 40 mg and everything has been much better.  I don't feel any different except that I am not worring myself sick.  Now my worries and controllable and rational.  This medicine has made a huge positive change in my life.  As for side effects, I was very sleepy when I began taking it, but after about a month and a half it's not very bad.  I sleep well, no problem there.  I have a bit of dry mouth, but I just dring more water which is better for me anyway.  The side effects are so minimal and the medicine works great.  I only wish I would have taken my doctor's advice and started taking it earlier, it would have saved me a lot of anxiety.

I don't want to go too fast. You are meant to increase it slowly to avoid the side affects. Only meant to take 20mg for all patients. some side effects on 5mg-sleepy, a bit of nausea, but feeling less stressed. I am concerned that my doctor didn't say to start slowly on them. I told my pharmacist that I'd had bad effects from amitriptyline years ago and that I wanted to start really slowly. She said 3 days with 5 mg.. then 3 days with 10mg, then 20 mg after that. I am not gonna risk that! Plus my driving has been a bit affected at 5mg. Start slow people. And if having bad side affects go back to your doctor to change the medication. Hope you all feel better soon, and be kind to yourselves and tell friends and loved ones how they can support you at this time.

I should have had the testosterone issue treated properly, but they insisted I used an ineffective testosterone gel. A year ago I found out that getting testosterone injections was far more effective and less expensive than androgen.  by then I was hooked on Celexa/Citalopram. I eventually weaned myself off of anti depressants, (thanks to medical mj which helped immensely, and I no longer need that) - but after 3 weeks off celexa, and my test levels normal, I had the biggest spiritual breakthru in my life. My gut feeling is BigPharma does not care about the condition of your soul, they just want to make money.  Anti depressants are only for people who absolutely need them or will die. I would do everything in my power to treat the real cause of depression, and not use an anti depressant. NEVER AGAIN for me. At age 58, my soul is finally free and I am back to normal and happy now

261$Condition: Depression$2/13/2013 9:24:58 AM$Reviewer: StillAlive, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"This wonderdrug is a lifesaver! I was unbelievably low, started taking it, and could not believe the positive results!

In retrospect, I discovered that I have been depressed most of my life. After hitting a major low, I asked my doctor for help, and he prescribed Celexa (Citalopram).

The only ""negative"" side effect is extremely low sex drive (on a scale of 1 to 10, about 0.5). However, considering how life is now worth living, I hardly even care! You probably can't understand unless you've experienced it...

For people just starting to take Celexa (or Citalopram), I suggest starting with no more than 10 mg in the morning. Don't take it at night! The side effects I experienced by starting off with 20 mg at night might not have been caused by the medication (according to my doctor), but I suggest that you take no chances: start in the morning with or after breakfast. Keep in mind that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it is NOT a train coming at you!"

In fact I had people telling my I looked depressed.  I was also placed on Lorizapam for anxiety which works great. I continued to take the Citalopram at my doctors advise but I still experienced the same level of depression. After four months on the medication I still have trouble sleeping at night. If I miss a dose i have the worse headache. The biggest issue for me is that it is VERY hard to orgasm if at all.

Everything was great in the beginning but slowly wasn't  as effective. After I had the baby and quit breastfeeding, I decided to go up to 40 mg. I wasn't sure if it was just hormones. Now i'm irritable and agitated frequently (let me note that my son is a Happy baby!), I have no concentration, I can never get enough sleep whether its 6 or 10 hours, and my sexual desire is long gone. And once again, I'm back to my emotional breakdowns. I can't even hold my composure at work anymore :(  I'm gonna try going back down to 20 mg. If that doesn't work, i'm gonna have to switch..

On the plus side, the meds have definitely eased the urge to drink. The down side is I have headaches every single day. Hard to say whether they are due to alcohol withdrawal or citalopram, but taking Tylenol eases the pain. It has made me slightly constipated, I was hoping to lose weight since I cut out the alcohol, but I've stayed the same. The worst side effect is that I'm tired all the time! I feel like I'm walking around in a fog and am totally un-motivated to do anything above the bare minimum.

Since my mother was chronically depressed her whole life and so was her mother I decided to stay on the drug and lower the dose to 10mg/day.  Eureka!  Smoothed out my emotions and lets me feel normal. I have a low tolerance for drugs so this seems to be a more than adequate dosage to alleviate my symptons.  Less can be more. I have been taking this for over 5 years and I am just starting to have sweating and insomnia issues that are not menopausal. I shower more and read alot to get sleepy.  I have had problems with rashes when I don't hydrate effectively and wear poyester clothing. Easy fix, drink more, wear cotton and stay cool. Overall this drug does the job that Zoloft couldn't.

I stopped taking it after 5 days.  I was prescribed this medication in order to combat grief symptoms and anxiety after the death of both of my parents.  I had high hopes, as I had never been on an anti-depressant and was hoping this might make me feel like ""me"" again so that I could do everyday activities without getting stressed and exhausted.  It did improve my quality of sleep and I woke up refreshed and energized, but I would ""crash"" later in the day, a few hours before I was to take my next dose.  It was how I imagine a drug user's ""highs"" and ""lows"" to be, on a milder level.  I had compulsive suicidal thoughts on this medication, and because of this I probably should have told someone I was taking it (I meant for my use of this drug to be private).  Nothing I would act on, but the compulsive thoughts were there.  After having one, I remember thinking to myself, ""woah, I can't believe I just thought that.""  I was almost more anxious on this med and the boomerang effect on my mood was just too much.  May work for some, but not for my particular case."

I've increased my dosage to 30mg and found my ""red"" anger poking through.  I've since reduced to 20mg and found it just as effective for depression (as 30mg).  Even keel.  Sadness is apparant at times, but no face-down on the floor depression.  Considering tapering off to check weight gain (18 lbs).  Could be meds, could be age."

478$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/28/2011 4:35:41 PM$Reviewer: AMS1010, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$I started taking Celexa for major panic attacks that flipped my life upside-down. I took the medication and it helped me for the first few months, but after about 2 months on Celexa it started to effect other parts of my life. Sex was not an option, it took away any desire I had, and when I did my mind wasn't there. I began to find myself zoning off for long periods of time, feeling like a droid. I decided I didn't want to be on it and told my doctor, she asked if I still battled with my anxiety and panic disorder and I told her it was still present but not as bad. She decided it was time to up my dose to 40 milligrams. I took the 40 MG for about 2 months and the zoning out and zombied out feeling was still there, I couldn't be intimate, and I decided to go off the medication without notifying my doctor. I stopped taking it cold turkey and experienced major brain spaces, periods of time where I couldn't think, almost like my brain was having a seizure. I would get light headed and felt sick, and had emotional break downs and vivid horrible dreams for a while. I decided I should taper off the medication, took my 20 MG instead of 40 and slowly stopped taking it. I am doing well, am not battling with myself anymore and I can think straight for the first time in almost a year. I believe the medication played a role in my recovery, but doesn't come without other battles.

So if any men out there are having this problem.It's not you it's the medication.I had always climaxed everytime I had sex before I started taking this medication.With me I have to consider changing my medication.My girlfriend is getting pissed and doesn't understand the side effects.

At first, it worked ok and didn't have any side effects.  Yet, after a year of being on this medication, I have noticed that I don't enjoy anything in my life and all of my relationships are slowly deteriorating.  This medication has also made me extremely tired, lose focus at work, and gain over 40 lbs in the past year-this is very uncharcteristic since I only gained about 1 to 2 lbs a year before taking Citalopram.  After a major spell of depression while being on citalopram, I decided to ask my doctor to change my medication. I am now taking Wellbutrin for only 2 days so far and already feel better and more hopeful about life(dr. said Wellbutrin is an NDRI which affects the brain differently than SSRI meds like Citalopram).  I hope the Wellbutrin works.

I decided after a severe anxiety attack 3 months ago to take the pills prescribed I started at 10mg for a month and saw marked improvement in my mood and a decrease in anxiety. The side effects were tolerable (dry moth and tiredness) then I went to 20mg when I saw a plateau and again it worked even better than 10mg and i saw an overall improvment but now again Im increasing to 30mg so I hope that it will be efffective to take it.

Worked well for that and social anxiety. This drug is a definite killer of one's sex life. After 12 years or so of taking, I decided to try and get off this drug. My 1st attempt was a disaster thanks to my doctor at the time telling me ""just quit taking"", not gradually decrease. Never, ever try it this way. I have since then been fired him. My main advice for those attempting withdrawal is to do so in a gradual, well-managed way. Keep a record as to when you start, how you feel day by day, any unusual occurrences. I started with a 1/2 tab decrease for a week, then 1/4 for another week, and finally 1/4 every other day for the final week. I still can hardly believe I am free of this drug, but I am and my life is much better for it. The key is to slowly step it down. "

I started with the usual 10 mg. Seemed to have good result in first couple of days. Then the usual increase to 20 mg (minimum therapeutic dose) after a week. 10 days after upping the dose I had been doing well but had 3 very 'down' days. Called the Dr., he upped the dose to 40 mg.
Had myriad of side effects at this point, including blurry vision, yawns, increased sexual desire, daytime sleepiness, night time insomnia, among others. Most were fairly mild (I can live on 4-5 hours of sleep if the trade off is feeling this OK) and passed after 2 to 4 weeks at 40 mg. Increased sexual desire is a good thing, I had NONE before. Girlfriend is much happier now.
I have had depression and anxiety my whole life. I had never sought treatment as I felt that I was 'dealing with it' effectively on my own. Boy was I ever wrong. I should have done this 40 years ago. Can't remember EVER feeling this good!
I just hope it lasts because it sounds like getting off of this drug can be very difficult."

I began taking 20mg once per day and it helped but not completely. My doctor upped my dose to 40 mg once per day and it has definitely taken care of my depression and stress issues. When I began taking it I got the shakes a little bit, but that ended after 3 days and I have had no problem since. It is definitely a miracle drug for my problems. 
On a second note, my daughter (26) began taking this for anxiety - 20 mg twice per day. It caused the shakes to start out with which went away, but then her hands, wrists, ankles and lips swelled up. It was the citalopram which caused these problems. So, two different results within our same family. She would probably tell you to stay away from it. I say it works perfectly, but please be careful. First sign of a side effect, call the doctor."

After a few days I felt a calming effect. However, after 1 week I could no longer reach an orgasim & my sleep was horrible. In additon, I was tired much of the time. I have decided to not take anymore anti depressants as most all of them have sexual side effects. I am not that depressed & have managed for 60 yrs. I probably should not have started these meds. I have not met anyone who had anything good to say about these drugs. I do not know anyone who was severely depressed. Can I stop taking my 10 MG all at once or do I have to cut down to 5 MG 1st?

I started feeling much better within a couple of weeks, but it does make it hard to sleep. I was then given another medication for insomnia, but that just made me tired all the time, so now I just try to get along with a little tossing and turning before I can fall asleep most nights.
I've been wanting to get off of my meds for a while now, but it's been a struggle because I've become so dependent on them (as happens a lot with SSRIs like Citalopram, or at least so I've read). I halved my dosage to 10mg about 2 months ago and tried stopping them once, but I just started slipping back into a deep depression.
Citalopram definitely helped me get back the ability to get up in the morning and get things done, but it's a bitch to try to get completely off of it and to feel 100% normal again."

After 3 weeks on the medications I overdosed on both, trying to kill myself. I had to be taken off amitriptyline due to the effects that tricyclic antidepressants will have on my body after my overdose, i was put on 25-75mg trazodone as needed at night, and my citalopram dosage was increased to 60mg daily. So far I have been pretty content on this medication, however I am not sure if that is due to my life changes I have made since the episode. Trazodone is also wonderful for helping me get to sleep. If you are on this medication, DO NOT forget a dose. I forgot a dose one day, met with my therapist later that day and when I got home I was so distraught and upset and couldn't really understand why I was bawling. I also recently started hitting myself when I get upset and I had never done that before I took this medication.

I started on 10mg about four years ago and within the first couple of weeks felt much better.  It worked great for about 8 months, but have had to regularly increase dosage over the last 4 years.  I didn't notice any side-effects until I was up to 40mg.  Then I started experiencing decreased libido and slight weight gain.  I've now been on 60mg (the maximum dosage) for four months and during this time have gained nearly 25 pounds, have no libido, and have horrible acne on my back.  And, the increased dosage hasn't helped my depression or anxiety.  I also was camping in the jungle in Central America and forgot to bring enough Celexa with me.  I was without it for about 4 days and the withdrawal was HORRIBLE.  I was dizzy and confused and my face went numb!  Overall, it worked wonders at first, but now am exploring other options and can't wait to get off of it!  I would not recommend taking more than 40mgs - it had no positive impact on me, and numerous studies I've read have indicated that this is usually the case.  If you're on 40mg and feel like you need to increase your dosage, talk to your doctor about switching meds!

I love it! I was depressed, angry and withdrawn from everyone around me and would bite someones head off without any provocation. I also worried about every little thing. After taking it for a month I started to feel better and mellowed. It's hard to get me angry now and the depression is gone and I don't worry about much of anything. Have gained 10 lbs recently but started working out and lost most of it and feel better too! Weight gain is only an issue if you let it be and choose to sit around and not work out and eat healthy. Can't reach a climax very easily, but solved my pme problem and that's a good side effect for me! There is no shame in taking it, I put it off for too long and regret it now. Life is so much better and everyone can stand to be around me again and I them. I've found I'm actually a fun person since taking this. Just take it! Wake up in the morning, take the pill and forget about it. Only warning I have is, take it everyday! If you don't you and everyone around you will know that your not on it! After a couple days without due to forgetting to take with me on vacation, I was back to my old self in full force. Don't let all the discouraging comments on this site sway you. Try it for a couple months and see what happens, if  you like it keep it, if not then try something else. But you have to give it time, it will not work over night! A month and a week was how long it took for me. Yeah I could feel something after two weeks but really noticed and started getting comments on my attitude after a month. 
613$Condition: Depression$1/7/2011 4:20:13 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$This drug makes me feel great mentally!!!  My major side effect is clenching my teeth. When I was upped to 1 and 1/2 pills I broke my tooth and have TMJ syndrome.  Dr. switched me to Lexapro........made me feel horrible mentally.  I'm back on Citalopram but 1 pill now and clenching isn't too bad and feel mentally great again.  I take it around 8pm, sleep like a log and am refreshed upon waking.   Have lost 4 pounds which I didn't need to lose.  I took Zoloft years ago and it made me a zombie and gained 15 pounds on it.  I highly recommend Citalopram but most drugs work differently on each person.  Report your symptoms to your Dr.  Dosage can make the difference.

The first week of taking this medication was very hard for me.  I would take it in the morning, like 7am...And it made me very lethargic and tired.  My mouth became extremely dry and every time I would yawn, it felt like i could faint or like a weird floating feeling...Very strange....But the sexual side effects are great...Increased sexual stamina.

At first it worked well, except for the weight gain.  Now, I am suffering mood swings, which is not the reason I went on this medication.  I spoke with my doctor about the weight gain, because after 16 months on this drug, I had gained 30 pounds.  My doctor said this drug caused weight gain and caused problems with losing it.  With my doctor's approval, I am weaning myself off of this medicine.  He said that withdrawl symptoms can be severe coming off.  I hope it won't be too bad and that I can lose all the weight I have put on.  I also suffered from the headaches and nightsweats.   The drug did work for my anxiety, but the weight gain got to be too much for me.

It began affecting my everyday life.  I was not able to wear jewelry or even go through a car wash.  I began using Lexapro but my insurance company requested to change my prescription to citalopram because it is cheaper.  My physician agreed.  I take 40mg a day.  Without this medicine I would not be able to function normally.  I had hoped to not have to take this medicine all my life.  I tried to stop it on my own but I couldn't take the withdrawls.  If I miss a dose, I feel the affects.  My head feels like it is in the ""twlight zone"" or something.  It is not a good feeling.  I realize a person should not try to stop the medication without the help of a physician.  Taking this medicine has improved my life a great deal.  I was afraid that I would reach a point of not being able to function in society.  I am thankful and continue to take the medicine."

We actually enjoy each other's company now. We're facing foreclosure on our home and I find myself able to handle it without panicking or excessive worry.

Troubles sleeping, tiredness during the day even after a nap, weight gain, diarreha, nausea, very noticeable increase in menstrual cramps, definate increase in sweating, change in appetite. When I first started taking citalopram after that first inital month my anxiety seemed to disappear. That part of the pills is very nice but being a single mother I can not handle being unable to sleep and being so darn tired ALL the time. Then after taking these for several months I have started to feel anxiety again. I take these every day and have not skipped a day. The other day I even had a panic attack. This medication is just not worth it to me. Be aware of ALL side effects when taking something. Also check out if you can take something like ibuprophren or asprin while on the medication trust me you won't want to deal with why. It is NOT fun and can be scary.

I was hesitant about getting on any mood med, but it has helped me tremendously. I am here writing this review... that's the point, I'm here. Diagnosed with major depression at 19, I was prescribed this pill by my family physician after several doctors visits relating to depression and its toll on my mind and body. It took me a while to loose some of the edge of being depressed all the time, but the fact is, I did loose the edge. Not perfection, but hey, no one is perfect. But I know that when I stopped taking this med, I relapsed into another major depressive episode. Went back to the med after 6 months of being utterly miserable all the time, and started improving within months. It takes months, realize, for this particular medicine to show its benefits to the user. Others see results sooner than you will; remember, when you're truly depressed everything is gray. If the roof fell on you you wouldn't care. That's depression. By the time you've realized that you need to see your doctor, make the appointment, actually GO and discuss what you're going through... you have already put your body and mind through so much stress OF COURSE the med won't be an instant cure-all. To the reviewers who've been on this pill for only five days or not long at all, WAIT before submitting your reviews. I am here to testify that without this medicine (the ONLY medicine or supplement I take), I wouldn't have been here today writing this really, really long post. 

Seek help. If this pill doesn't work after six months I would advise you to actively find alternatives with the help of your physician and your physician alone. Not a friend. Not a TV commercial or magazine ad. A real doctor. 

Believe me, you will go crazy (crazier?) trying to piece together all the med jargon you googled online. Hope this helps some one out there in internet land.

The drug seemed to work for the first few months I was on it, but eventually the drawbacks began to outweigh the posities. The drug significantly lowered my libido. It also led to a somewhat unreal feeling of constant happiness and satisfaction.
I eventually felt that the drug wasn't really helping me with my problems. It was covering them up, ineffectively at that.
I found that talking to a therapist was the most effective way to treat my disorder, and I strongly discourage potential users from simply taking a drug to try and cope.
Many doctors are eager to overprescribe drugs and just hope that the problem will go away. It won't. Upping the dosage will not force you to treat the source of these problems.
Personally, while I think that the drug helped me get through a difficult time in my life, I don't think that it's worth losing yourself in the process.
Mental pain, like physical, is indicative that something is wrong. When we treat a physical ailment we don't just treat the symptom; we treat the cause. I feel that anxiety, depression and other emotional illnesses should be looked at in the same manner."

799$Condition: Depression$4/1/2010 1:19:38 AM$Reviewer: crowe27, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been taking this medicine since March 2008. It is the most effective one I have ever taken for overall depression, mood swings, bad anxiety, and bipolar disorder. It keeps me chilled out so I can relax and be myself, and not panicky and irrational like I can be when it gets bad. Different medicines work for different people, but after Zoloft, Paxil, and Effexor not doing it for me, this was a godsend. I am not advertising for this medicine, this is just what works for me. I recommend to anyone who has any or all of these symptoms to not lose hope and keep an open mind to medicine when therapy isn't enough. If the first or the next rx doesn't work, be patient and keep trying-everyone has a formula that will help make their lives liveable again.

This drug helped me greatly.  No more panic attacks or constant anxiety.  My insomnia also has eased up.

I started immediately seeing the results.  Everyone around me noticed that something was different about me.  It helped my social life tremendously.  I was an exceptionally happy person.  Although, now it seems like I have grown immune to it or something.  I'm overall a happy person, but I no longer feel the need to be social anymore.  The only person I really spend my time with anymore is my boyfriend.  Really, I don't even mind not social, its the weight gain that I don't like. I have gained over 50 pounds since I started taking the medication.  I have diabetes in my family history and it really scares me that I will soon get the disease myself.  I am really starting to think of quiting it, but I do not know for certain yet.  Another thing, that I am not going to go into detail about is my sex life.  This medication has tremendously affected my sex life, in a bad way.  I hope this helps.

Overall, Citalopram is pretty good. I take 20 milligrams each morning but sometimes I feel like I need 30 milligrams in a situation where I feel the onset of an anxiety attack. I've tried to not take it for a day and I find myself feeling extremely nervous, anxious, having feelings of guilt for trivial reasons, and somewhat ""twitchy."" There is a possibility that these are a mixture of withdrawal symptoms and feelings of vulnerability to depression because I know I hadn't taken my medication.  
Another problem I have with Citalopram are the sexual side effects. I feel less sexually driven and an inability to climax on a consistent basis.

A month later I went from a 137ibs to 152ibs so I contacted my doctor he said this medication does not make you gain weight, he said it was my diet. With total weight gain I went from 137ibs to 175ibs. After reading some of the comments at WebMD I found out that this medication DOES make you gain weight. I stopped taking the medicine cold turkey, I am back on my old medication and my weight is starting to come down. After leaving this medication, I had no more bad ideas but sometimes, I cannot control my eyes, they twitch from one side to the other for a second and it happens when im driving. I dont know if it is some kind of withdraw side effect from the medicine and if this is happened to someone else, PLEASE post a comment, I will be checking regularly."

It only took 20 mgs. to raise my B/P.  It usually stays around 110/58 or 112/62.  Now it hovers at 124/76 too high for me.  I have been on it for one day and and twelve hours later, I am trying to get it out of my system.  I cannot take it no more, I left word to the Dr. on his voice mail to go back to Xanax in the morning - .25 mg.  The worst part is that I am not depress - just anxious in my job.  Other effects are Rapid Heartbeat - Headaches - Dizziness - Not able to focus.  Thank goodness I took it one time only!

I guess I don’t like it, as much now that I realize my lack of energy and desire to go outside on a daily basis may be more of a side effect to the drug.  But, I will say no more crying all day, so I guess you have to take the good with the bad.

I stopped worrying but did have side effects once I stopped the xanax that included dry mouth, heavy sweating in arm pits, blurred vision in left eye, tingle sensations in hands and feet, pounding heart beat which would pulse in head as I slept at night, dizziness, lightheaded, and decreased sexual sensation. (could climax just take longer..too long) also felt tired throughout the day even after stopping the xanax so I switched to taking at night which helped. side effects improved or I got used to them and continued taking for 5 months but never really felt like I needed it as I was still having my original problem and once convinced it was not something serious I felt like I could handle things without drugs so I tapered off too 10mg for two weeks then stopped. (doctor wanted me to stay on it until December) On about day 4 of stopping I started feeling severe lightheadedness almost feel kinda drunk and it has not stopped yet (7th day) I have considered taking xanax again until this stops but have not yet (been toughing it out) very scaring feeling wish I never took this drug and just want to feel normal again. I would rather have worry and pain than this. seeing a surgeon next week to hopefully fix hernia and put all my worries behind.

I took it when I got home in the late afternoon.I felt a bit nauseaus, but it was o.k. I also felt shaky and sort of weak.My stomach bubbled with gas, and again, bathroom time.I'm not sure that my symptoms are as bad as the cure, so I'm not sure if I will hang in there to see if it stops. I plan to split my 20 mg pill in half, and just take 10 mg to see if the side effects are lessened. If it's the same, I think I will stop taking this pill.I also don't like getting headaches if I don't take it.

This med. stopped my out of control crying, the angry mood swing and thoughts of ending my life. After about 3-5 wks, myself, family and friends noticed a complete change! Happy again, brain was clear and no bad thoughts.

I call my previous dr and/or ;oca; free clinic // inform them of my situation (and I didnt take NO as an answer) and demand a RX from previous Dr and/or emergency appt at clinic (they charge per your income = I didn't have any money at the time and just had the bill for $20 mailed to me - paid them $2 a month until bill was paid) My doctor informed me that to stop most and/or any  anti-depression meds cold turkey can be and/or is life-threatening

The first three days I had a headache, dry mouth, and my jaw was clenching. It was tolerable. I now feel WONDERFUL! Better than I have in YEARS! I was a complete skeptic plus after reading some of the reviews I was a bit nervous to even start on meds. Well, I'm more energetic. I feel way better about myself no longer just wanting to be alone and cry. No longer feeling like a nervous wreck or having really bad anger. My sex drive has INCREASED! I do have a loss of appetite not too badly though. I still do have a bit of anxiety but citalopram has worked wonders on my depression. I'm still seeing a counselor so I'm sure in time with that it will go work out as well.

I have been on citalopram for two months now and have never felt better.  I am more energetic and that foggy, muddled feeling has gone.  My thoughts are now clear and I can focus on problems and plans without all the effort it used to take.  

I don't know whether or not this drug will have the same effect on you as it does me, but if you are having depression symptoms I have two pieces of advice for you:  1) don't stop trying different medications until you have found the one or ones that works best for you; 2) try citalopram.  "

The panic disorder went away, so did some of the agoraphobia (though sometimes I still feel a little of this), but then I started hearing voices. So I gradually took myself off of it after being on it for a year, and even though the psychotic symptoms got better, they haven't completely quit. This pill makes me feel absolutely horrible. It does almost the exact same thing to me the Prozac did (see my other review), I get horrible jitters, massive confusion, and very sleepy (almost drunk) for days on end. When I'm off it, I feel much better. As far as helping with the Panic Disorder--I'm cured, so it worked rather well for that. Not a good med for schizophrenics (there's a lot of truth to that distasteful joke).

Celexa is a tiny pill and within 1-2 days, i felt the anxiety just melt away,  i could breathe again!!!! its also helping my depression, im more motivated to do things because im less anxious. it made me realize how serious my problem was, a huge contrast. no other side effects except i gained 10lbs but that has stabilized. im more regular, which is good. this is a fantastic drug i highly recommend it.

1136$Condition: Depression$4/29/2009 4:55:52 PM$Reviewer: $3$3$5$Been on this drug for over a year now.  I definitely  feel better than before, however I also changed a lot of things in my life sense.  So, I don't know if it's the medicine or the positive life changes.  I take 20 mg before bed and sleep like a rock but  I feel hungover in the morning & if i get out of bed to quickly I get a major headache... I get a 3-4 day headache at least 1 a month.  Also, very LOW sex drive  I don't mind it but my husband does.  I think it has helped me but I may ask to lower my dosage and eventually stop.

I don't think I would've survived had a compassionate Dr not suggested I start taking an A-D and doing some other things to manage the stress and depression.

I lost my health insurance not long after the marriage ended (unrelated, long story) and tapered myself off (the non-generic Celexa was very expensive.)

Big mistake. Half a decade later and after a number of setbacks and involuntary life changes and financial problems, I was a mess but because things had been happening slowly, I really didn't see it.

Recently and after a case of the shingles, several rounds of cold and flu, and an inner ear infection that took away my equilibrium...

Some family members sat me down and told me they were very concerned that stress and depression were ruining my health and for what might happen to me...

I went to my Dr and got a prescription for the new generic form.

What a difference! Less than a week back onto a 20mg dose and already things are changing for the better!

A-D's are serious drugs and can have serious side effects, if a prescription does not help or generates overtly negative effects, run back to your Dr and change something. I have a family member who had to go through 4 different drugs before the 5th one did the trick"

I posted about 2-3 weeks ago. 
The drug has helped me out a lot. I have been able to read and understand the self help and self improvement books. The side effects are minimal from what I experienced in the beginning. I am tired and I do have more head aches, but they are not bad ones. I have keept to 10mg and have not increased my dose to the full amount of 20. Though I do notice that I get a bit shakey and my eyesight seems a little fuzzy at times. I have started to feel down or cry, but now I am able to think why I am feeling the way I do. I am able to turn my mood around before it gets worse. When I do find my mood is getting worse, I can now reason with myself and look at the brighter side of every situation. It has helped me be more understanding, helped me stop yelling and helped me be more calm. I don't experience the Road Rage and am able to be more in control. Once I feel that my situation is changing or better than it was before. I will consult my doctor on how to get myself off of this, as I don't want it to become  a perminanat crutch for my mental health.
I do have a lower sex drive, but it hasn't gone away.    "

The only downer - when I DO drink, I get tired VERY quickly.  I can usually skip a dose if I want to party! "

The first doctor to prescribe it didn't listen when I told him it wasn't working. My new doctor prescribed me Lexapro which worked wonders but my insurance would not cover it so he gave me Citalopram. He had to increase it from 20 to 40 because it was not working. I have unfortunately gained 30-40 lbs which isn't helping with the whole depression thing. If I miss a dose, my mood swings are worse and I end up crying because I yelled at my little girl. :(

I feel like I haven't found the cure to my real problem.  I cannot physically tolerate any stressful situation.  Citalopram helps treat my symptoms.  When I stopped taking it for a couple of days and I had an animated phone conversation, I felt a lot of chest pressure and pain.  I then took some Lorazepam, as the doctor advised, should this happen.  It was scary, but I am OK.  I am continuing to take the Citalopram.

I have found, though, that different life events moderate the effects of the drug rendering it less effective.  During more stressful times in life, you may find the medications effectiveness drop, but I saw this to be expected.

I did find that the medication made me far less moody and less agitated by ""the little things.""  I am a self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive and I find it difficult to concentrate in disorganized environments or a room that is in disarray.

One last thing: After being out of country and suddenly running out of the medication (under highly stressful conditions), I experience what I could only describe as a persistent anxiety attack.  I would highly advise patients to ensure they have ample supply when traveling abroad!

Even with my Ambien I have experienced sleep problems. I experienced most all the side effects and have been extremely sick since first I started this medication and my illnesses got worse.  Have been in ER a couple of times with all the symptoms this medicaiton has, but, since I didnt really read the serious side effects I had no clue I personally should not take this medication with other medications I have. A friend suggested today I look at not only serious side effects but drug interactions and after2 1/2 months of ER doctors running all kinds of tests and coming up negative and my doctor treating me for bronchitis but not paying attention to my other complaints I have had the following serious drug interactions as noted under the tab of interactions with other drugs Tell your doctor immediately if any of these rare but very serious side effects occur: stomach pain, fainting, bloody/black/tarry stools, vomit that looks like coffee grounds, easy bruising/bleeding, muscle weakness/cramps, seizures, fast/irregular/pounding heartbeat, difficulty urinating, change in the amount of urine.  I have fainted once in my life years ago...but 2 weeks ago when she increased my dosage a few nights later I fainted...I thought for no reason at all!  I take Lorazepam and Ambien for over 5 years and evidently this drug does NOT interact well for me.  I also have had Vicodin due to the pain from the coughing from the bronchitis along with OTC cough syrups and Theraflu type medications. I HIGHLY suggest you pay much attention to side effects and drug interractions PRIOR to agreeing to take this antidepressant!

I too have had vivid, pleasant dreams, no nightmares.  I have had a significant decrease in libido, but I've actually been able to last longer now with my wife.  I have a great life, wife, kids but always worried about the the 'other shoe dropping' mainly with work.  This drug has taken the edge off, and I feel so much more peaceful, happy now & more comfortable with myself in social situations, more confident. I have not experienced more anger, actually the opposite.  I am only taking 10mg/day in morning (cutting pills in half).  I actually felt WORSE, more jittery, anxious when I was on 20mg (or 10mg of Celexa). I do not feel like I am on a medication. It took alot of courage for me to accept the fact that maybe I needed medical help for my anxiety.  I am not one to normaly take any medical drugs. I tried to work through it, talk with social workers. This drug helps me to take life one day at a time & enjoy it. This medication works for me.

I could always feel my heart beating in my chest so depending on my moods I could feel it pounding or skipping a beat every now and then. I also was very aggrivated by sounds in the evening. If my husband rolled over in bed I would get a shock through my body and get startled and I would be very angry about it. Last night was the first night I took citalopram, I didn't feel my pounding all night and I wasn't startled at all by small sounds throughout the night. I will review again in a month. I hope I don't get all the bad side effects. If this medication helps me after 16 years of extreme anxiety I will put up with any side effects.

I could concentrate, there wasn't a black cloud feeling, I was able to sit and enjoy reading again.  I haven't felt that good in ages.
The following couple of weeks things started to get muddled again.  So I am moving up to 40mg per day as per my doctor.
The other side affects I have had have been stomach aches and sweating especially at night.  But nothing I haven't been able to deal with so far.

I went to the Dr about what I thought where hormonal issues but after blood tests telling all was normal, I was asked if I was depressed.  After breaking down and crying over how awful my life was, I had to agree I could be.  The first few days I did experience a fogginess where it was hard to get words out when people where speaking to me, but now that I have been taking it for a month, I am not so agressive, do not feel so low, my confidence has come back and I can actually go to dinner parties and not feel so exhausted afterwards by having to speak to people.  I do not feel overly tired but I do take it right before I go to bed.

Hang with it for awhile. Everything gets a little better with every day you take it. MOST of the side effects diminished greatly for me after a couple weeks. Seemed like I had 'em all. Nausea, dizziness, forgetfulness, blurred vision, drowsiness, felt spacey, hard time concentrating. Most are pretty much gone, tiredness seems to be the worst but still better than when first started.
 Also for the guys, Dr. said it could cause impotence which it did but only for about a week and went away. Now, it's just a little harder to have an orgasm, but thats ok. Hope this helps you out."

For about 10 years I've been dealing with depression and panic/anxiety order.  For years I tried everything to not have to take meds - stress management class, relaxation therapy, exercise, meditation, you name it.  Finally, I ""gave in"" and decided I couldn't fight on my own anymore.  The first week was pretty awful.  I felt drunk all the time.  Couldn't drive and had a tough time at work.  Then one day, my mind was clear!!!  Seriously clear!  Like I could actually focus.  The sense of being overwhlemed was gone.  It's been about 4 years.  Sometimes I come off it for 2-3 months just to give my boday a break (no one ever told me to do that, I just do.  Each time, the withdrawal is the same as when I first started taking it.  The dizzy drunkness.  It usually takes me just 2 months to remember why I went on it in the first place.  It's an awesome drug.  Doesn't interfere with my life at all.  I still get happy, sad, scared, excited.  I'm just able to focus so much better and take one thing at a time.  I've been married for 5 years now and will be starting a family soon.  I really don't want to have to come off while pregnant or breastfeeding.....

It helped my depression and anxiety immensely yet their were two side effects I experienced while taking citalopram.  I was tired all of the time and at night had trouble falling asleep.

Overall the bad outweighed the good so I was taken off it, with no luck so far on other drugs (prozac).

Doc told me it would take about three weeks to get into my system but I have been feeling a difference just in two days. Hope it gets better from all the good reviews I have read about this medication. I didn't take the xanax other then when I ONLY felt like I needed one. They were very addicting when I was taking them as prescribed. I was happy to hear that citalopram isn't addicting.  I use to get upset easily and cry when things really got to me, now I have been more relaxed and feel better overall. Im not on edge about things the last couple days and I hope I have the same luck as the other users at dropping a few pounds! Side effects with me has been a little dry mouth and maybe a little tired, but so far so good! Will report later with further comments.

I definitely have seen results for my anxiety and repetitive negative thoughts.  After three weeks I graduated to 15 mg (doctor agreed it was okay to cut pill in half).  The goal is 20mg. I am super sensitive to drugs and wanted to start slow to make sure I could tolerate it.  Side effects included loss of appetite and tight stomach for about 5 days after starting and again as I increased the dose.  I feel like this drug might be just the ticket to control my overactive anxious thoughts.  I am very hopeful.

Quite often, I would work myself into a panic over small things and sometimes over nothing, and my heart would pound rapidly causing my anxiety level to go even higher.  I feel that citalopram has had the effect of keeping my anxiety below the level that would trigger a rapid heartbeat.  The only side effect of any significance I have noticed is that I am often unable to climax during sex.  Other than that it has been incredible helpful.

My wife of 14 years divorced me for a 24 year old kid who worked for us, she was 38.  A friend recommended a psychologist but after the session she said ""you need to see a psychiatrist"".  She recommended one who said ""you're in pretty bad shape, let's see how you do with this drug"".  Well, after less than a week, I was alive again.  I slept well, no dreams, no anxiety attacks, overall happiness (before I felt like wanting to cry all the time) and best of all, sexually I performed like a million.  No ED or premature ejaculation.  I dated a lot of girls in their 20s (I'm 40) and many said they couldn't believe a guy my age could outperform kids their age.  When I told the Doctor I had ED he said the pill could help, but I didn't mention the PE.  It was after a couple of weeks that I noticed how long I was lasting that I looked it up and learned that Citalopram could help eliminate this condition and believe me it did.  This pill truly saved my life.

After not taking this for almost 2 months, I started to feel very tense, jittery, and angry over the slightest thing. Annoyed at everything. I took two tablets, thinking that that would calm me down, and I had a very scary reaction of rapid heartbeat, excessive shaking and the feeling of loosing consciousness.

No major depressive episodes or panic attacks (other than a few caused by other drugs) during this time. If I remember correctly, blurred vision the first week, but virtually no side effects since. Probably decreased libido but hasn't adversely affected that area of my life too much. It says not to drink alcohol, but I've never seen any real interaction while drinking. In all, a great choice, having had bad experiences with Zoloft (flat, 'zombie' mood) then Prozac (fine for a while but then truly horrible side effects when restarting it after a few months off).

I was being treated for both depression and anger and this has helped immensely with both.  I find myself calm, happy, rolling with the punches, and making rational decisions.  I did have sexual side effects (decreased libido, prolonged ""O"") for a while but they went away and that has returned to normal. This is a person I like being, I hope I can feel this way without the drug. "

1449$Condition: Depression$4/16/2008 1:47:56 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$Citalopram has given me my life back.  I suffered from depression, OCD, and anxiety since being a teenager.  After the birth of my daughter a year ago, I suffered from an extreme case of postpartum depression which pushed my current case of mild depression, OCD, and anxiety off the charts.  I finally sought treament last summer and started seeing major changes after 2-3 weeks taking 20mg.  My current dosage is now 60mg daily.  I suffered initally from all the major symtoms including headaches, drowiness, and loss of sex drive.  After 8+ months of using this drug, I only suffer from the loss of sex drive which seems to be getting better as time goes along.  Life is good now and I'm enjoying every moment with my family and friends.  My only regret was not to seek treatment earlier for my problems.

I noticed a difference after a couple of weeks, but after a couple of months I didn't feel I was as happy as I wanted to be. I tried adding Wellbutrin so that I could also quit smoking. The side affects were bad for me and I hadn't cut down on the smoking. I switched to 40mg of Citalopram two weeks ago and it's working amazingly for me. After being depressed for 10 years, I never thought I could actually be this happy. If this drug doesn't work for you, don't give up, there is something that will work for you. It might take a long time to find the right drug and dosage, but it's well worth it in the end. I'm glad I finally got help.

Although it hasn't taken the depression and anxiety totally away (it's not a happy pill) I feel motivated and can actually push the down feelings away and focus on something else. My depression isn't absorbing my life anymore, and I can function like I used to. I only wish that I would feel totally normal with no down thoughts, but I think therapy will help that go away. I have had no side effects except for yawning and tiredness a few hours after I take it, which helps me go to sleep, and this way I don't need a sleep drug for insomnia. I feel a little of the decreased sex drive, but that is a small price to pay for leading a normal life.

The 3rd day was fabulous - no headaches or nausea... I was in the best mood of my life. The 4th day was pretty good too, but every day after has been fairly blah. I suppose my disposition has improved a bit, but I'm still dealing with the non-hunger and I have lost 7 pounds because I can only manage to eat an orange or a yogurt every day. My hair has been falling out like it did after I gave birth. It definitely increased suicidal thoughts when dealing with a terrible break up two days before Xmas (though I had the presence of mind to have friends stay with me and not be alone), but it has helped me deal with everything better thus far. I'm going to take it for another month and see how things go. I'll let you know if anything changes.

I have been sick to my stomach and hardly able to eat also. I slept GREAT the first night, but only managed to get 1 hour of sleep last night - will try taking it in the morning to see if that helps. The other strange thing is that I am a very busy, rapid thinking person and if you picture all the trains of thought you have at once (which is typically 7) as lanes on a highway, I feel like 5 lanes have been blocked off and traffic is trickling through. Does anyone know how long the headache and nausea are supposed to last? I will post again as progress continues and side effects taper off.

On this one, I have relatively few.  I have gained about 5 pounds, but that is okay because I do not weigh very much.  It has helped with my depression, but I still feel anxious a lot, but that is probably mostly a logical reaction to life changes.  The problem is that I get very moody if I forget to take this medication, which I often do.  I then usually remember a few hours later and take it and start feeling fine soon after.  I have even experienced a panic attack because I forgot to take my dose of citalopram one day.  Also, I have been having worse nightmares than normal since getting on this, that bother me more than they used to.  Otherwise, this seems to be a good drug for me with few side effects, and hardly any physical side effects (no sexual problems unlike with Paxil :D )

I switched to Citalopram from Lexapro, which worked great aside from side effects in the first 2 months. Lexapro was unfortunately not covered by insurance, which was why I switched. I was on Citalopram for nearly a year, but it was not as effective as Lexapro had been. My mood was much more variable - good on some days, but terrible on others. In addition, I gained 20 lbs on this medication because it increased my appetite and caused me to crave carbohydrates.

After an MRI and spinal tap other tests to rule out multiple sclerosis (I seriously had 95% of the symptoms of MS) and a week in the hospital, I stopped taking this medication. The side effects completely stopped after about a month and a half and that was when I associated the 2.

1574$Condition: Depression$10/18/2007 3:17:31 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Prior to taking this medication I was experiencing severe depression symptoms--crying, loss of appetite, anxiety, sleep problems.  Once the medication was started and a therapeutic level was determined, my mood improved, appetite improved, anxiety symptoms decreased and rarely occur.  This medication has been very effective for me.

I was just okay.  Most of my family is on Prozac for depression.  I would like a medication to make me feel better 80% of the time and not feel just okay for 65% of the time.  There was at the start a stomach issue; where I felt that I was going to throw up and then it disappeared just as quickly as it came.  Through the course it did subside.  I feel it is a good standard medication, but I think I need a little more of a boost.  I know there will be down days and that is expected, but I feel I want a little more zip.

I have been on it for 9 months and could feel a significance difference in about 60 - 90 days as it was helping the chemical embalance get back to a normal range.
