2$Condition: Tourette's$11/25/2010 1:57:16 PM$Reviewer: Phydeaux, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$5$5$"See my previous review of this product used for control of Tourette's Syndrome.  I mentioned the poor adhesive quality of the generic version from 
par Pharmaceutical (""manufactured by: AVEVA Drug Delivery Systems A Nitto Denko Company"" according to the package).  I was able to locate a second generic version from Mylan Pharmaceuticals.  You may need to deal with a local NON-Chain pharmacy to secure this brand but it is well worth the effort.  This product is very flexible and adheres well for the full 7 days.  It is also comparable in size to the brand name product rather than the oversized PAR version.  So if the co-pay or outright cost of the product is an issue opt for the Mylan generic version if possible for best results."
3$Condition: Tourette's$11/17/2010 6:31:38 PM$Reviewer: Phydeaux, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$5$5$20+yr ago I was taking 5x 0.2mg daily.  Have been on 2x 0.3 Catapres for 20+ yrs.  While my TS symptoms were never debilitating I have found that this provides significant relief with little in the way of side effects.  Additionally my bp is well controlled and resting heart rate is often in the 50's but does not cause any problems such as dizzyness.  This product has recently become available in generic form.  The patch from PAR Pharmaceuticals is significantly larger than Catapres from Boehringer Ingelheim and less flexible.  The PAR brand do not stick well at all.  I have not been able to make then last a full 7 days to this point.  My pharmacist is ordering another generic brand for me to try.  Hopefully this will work better as my insurance has doubled my co-pay on the name brand now that a generic is available.

6$Condition: High Blood Pressure$9/23/2008 2:39:17 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$If you go swimming, the patch will come off. I use waterproof tape and tape around my arm. It's easier if you put Vaseline on the bottom half of the arm so all the tape does not stick, making it easier to remove the tape.
