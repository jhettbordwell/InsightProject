3$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$1/19/2015 2:14:01 PM$Reviewer: Woody, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I spent 20 years looking for a drug to relieve my depression.. I tried several classes of antidepressants with no or minimal relief. I am currently taking bupropion and escitalopram with several other mood drugs. Once we added Abilify a great weight was lifted. I am able to function now, which I was not able to. I love it. I have little or no side effects.

Not only do the problems it was to help with still exists now there is a myriad of side effects that are very serious and debilitating. I would be afraid for anyone who is entertaining it....not sure why FDA approved this Rx . I wouldn't suggest even for someone I didn't like.
