2$Condition: Other$2/1/2010 6:20:36 PM$Reviewer: Think twice, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) $1$1$1$As a caregiver, I have given this IM many times, and most patients don't care for it.  I've actually had some ask for Thorazine instead.  Even thought its given slowly, most tell me that the Zyprexa is tougher to receive that Thorazine.  Hope this helps.

Ease of use is low because I sleep 12 hours and am groggy for another 3-5 hours aftwards. My doc says there is a histamine effact that does not go away on lower doses
4$Condition: Other$12/27/2008 1:21:46 PM$Reviewer: 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $1$1$1$"once i was started on Zyphexa on admittion to hospital, I started a downhill dive.
In less than 6 weeks in the hospitl, I was not able to walk, talk, swallow, I began to drool and could barely talk.  I was told I was suffering from Parkinson.

Once I was discharged my family took me to a neurologist and he admitted to another hospital and took me off the zyphexa.  In less than one week I stopped the drolling, I was able to swallow and with the help of OT,PT and Speech therpy I was able to be moved to the Rehab side of the hospital.

I feel like a new person and I feel now it was all due to the medicine as the neurologist felt was the problem.   

What a nightmare for me and my family to have to go through while you were in a hospital seeking help."
