1$Condition: Depression$8/28/2019 5:13:49 PM$Reviewer: oldwhitelady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was diagnosed with post-partum depression after my third child was born. I was 40 years old, wound up with a c-section and an incision that wouldn't heal, and I couldn't breastfeed - no milk supply. I began Zoloft and titrated up to 100 mg daily. It took about 4-6 weeks for the side effects to dissipate. Totally changed my life. Eleven years later I do experience some emotional ""numbing"", but I'll take that over the very low lows I experienced with PPD. Additionally, I think I have always been low-key depressed even in my 20s. It def runs in my family. I occasionally think about titrating down and eventually going off the meds, but I haven't been given a good enough reason. lol."

This brought a lot onto my shoulders but Zoloft definately helped. The drug will not do all the work for you. You also have to be willing to better yourself aswell.

I feel like I'm operating at about 90% of my ""old"" self.  I didn't know if I'd ever feel this good again and I think Zoloft helped immensely with overcoming major depression and anxiety.  My symptoms developed about 4-5 years ago and I had tried everything:  therapy, supplements, dietary/lifestyle changes, not to mention about 10 different antidepressants (Paxil, Prozac, Lexapro, Effexor, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Fetzima).  I was afraid I was bipolar, or simply couldn't tolerate antidepressants, or that I was just screwed.  Zoloft has been a miracle for me.  I have slight nausea and that is it.  I take it in the morning.  Only 12.5mg and somehow that seems to be enough.  I'm shocked.  Don't give up!!  Keep trying until one works - there are a lot of them out there.  "

I've stayed on it for so long only because my psychiatrist never wanted to make any big changes in my medications in case it affected my schoolwork at a critical time.  On the bright side, I've never noticed any negative side effects either.  Basically, this medication did absolutely nothing for me.

I started having severe anxiety within 7 days, by 14 days I was unable to sleep.  I was completely unaware of what was real and what was not, unable to drive or function at all.  It was better to deal with my depression that to take this medication as it landed me in a psychiatric hospital for a month in order to on other medications to get me back to ""normal"".  Overall it took more than 2 years to get back to ""normal"" after taking this medication.  It has now been 8 years since starting this medication, and still the thought of it gives me severe anxiety and PTSD from the whole experience.  I would not recommend this as a first choice for treating depression. "

Overall I think it has been great with improving my overall mood, and taking the edge off when I'm around people; the only side effects I'm experiencing is consistently waking up in the middle of the night (which doesn't bother me much), and night sweats.  The night sweats are the worst thing by far...very annoying

Started and stopped several times thinking oh I will be fine without it. But no! 2 days after missing my dosage of 200mg I cant even carry on a normal conversation without being irritated . I broke down crying over things I used to be able to just let it fly buy , and to watch the news even brought me to more tears. I wasn't interested in anything , no housework done, errands, regular outings nothing! I went back on my 200mg dosage and after 2 days I was back to myself again....But don't forget about the major withdrawal symptoms I experienced during the time I thought I don't need to take my meds. Dizziness, unable to eat, my stomach hurt if I ate or didn't . Then I couldn't keep nothing down. I was so tired stayed in bed for days. I have now realized I can't live a happy life without it. But it took me at least 10 years fighting back to accept the facts. So listen to me, give it time to work, It wont work instantly. When I stared I was at 25mg...Now at 200mg....Life is good today and my future is prosperous. 
18$Condition: Depression$10/12/2016 8:04:04 PM$Reviewer: SoccerGirl000, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$After about a week and a half of using 25 mg of Zoloft daily, I decided to stop taking it because the side effects were so bad. I was getting bad nausea and abdominal pain as my doctors said I would, but I also had extreme insomnia. I was lucky if I got 2-3 hours of sleep a night over the week and half period. And when I did finally fall asleep, I woke up often. I also had extreme fatigue and hardly had the energy to walk about my house. It also caused some slight tremors and made my blood sugar drop dramatically. I also began to to develop ulcer-like sores on my tongue and gums.
19$Condition: Depression$5/11/2016 11:34:31 PM$Reviewer: dressedtorepress, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$This drug really helps with my depression. While I'm thankful that my mood is stable, the heartburn, constant state of sleepiness, and unquenchable thirst (dry mouth) really are hard to deal with. The heartburn happens about once or twice a month and comes with no known triggers as I take the pills with the same snack at the same time everyday. It's very uncomfortable to the extent that I had believed it was far more severe than heartburn at first. I'm constantly able to fall asleep no matter how much sleep I get. Possibly, Zoloft just makes me too tired to be sad. I suppose the drug is doing what it's meant to do: treat my depression. However, not having extreme heartburn for hours on end and never being able to feel fully awake are side effects I could do without. 
20$Condition: Depression$4/6/2016 8:36:58 AM$Reviewer: CJU, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I've been taking Sertraline/Zoloft for 5 years to treat depression.
I started at 25mg then to 50mg where I stayed for 3 years.
After a divorce I moved to 100mg for obvious reasons. For at least a year it seemed to do very well with crying episodes and overall getting through the divorce. Around the year mark the depression became much worse and I was extremely lethargic. I lost interest in everything, including friends and family. I wouldn't go on dates and it was all I could do to go to work. The odd thing was that I seemingly had everything a single person would want. A lake house, nice car, great job and my choice of who I wanted to date. 
However, people close to me had no idea that I became a recluse. They all assumed I was having the time of my life.
One morning I woke up and felt that I just couldn't take the pain anymore. I went to the kitchen, leaned over the sink with a large knife to my throat. While trying to decide if it would be better to instead cut my wrist, I stopped and called my doctor. I was surprised to hear her say to come right away to see her. When I drove to her office I was crying my eyes out because I hated who I had become. Thankfully my Dr didn't give up on me and actually up'd my dosage to 200mg. It honestly saved my life. I soon became depression free with the only side effect of still being lethargic. Also the dizzy brain zaps when I miss a dose.
I'm remarried and happy again, but always tired. My Dr. Has put me on a new medicine called Fetzima 20mg and has cut the Zoloft back to 100mg to help with the tiredness. So far so good after 3 weeks. I went through a few dizzy spells, but stuck with it and feel like my old self again.
If you or anyone you know has secluded themselves please know that there is hope. 
The first step is having someone who understands your sickness and that you don't choose to feel this way. 
The second step and hardest thing to do IMO is finding and then giving the medicine time to work. 
Best of luck."

When I tried it I did not sleep for three nights and became so exhausted. Then I noticed my thoughts were calm but I was so detached that I thought I could drive into a wall or another car and I would be fine with that. Dangerous stuff. I stopped the first week on it.

Only downside is it caused me to grind my teeth at night really bad. I would wake up with blood in my mouth and my jaw was unbearably sore. I had to stop using it because of the physical pain in my jaw, but otherwise I would not have switched to celexa. It works much better.

The one thing Zoloft has done is level my emotional state over the years and give me a clearer outlook on life.   I have had no side effects while on the drug and take no other medication to treat depression and anxiety.  I know I'm on a very high dose, but it has made a significant difference in my life.    I was taking Wellbutrin for a while with this drug during the winter months, but thought the overall effect I was experiencing made me drowsy and I felt ""cloudy"" so I stopped.   I'd recommend discussing Zoloft with your doctor if you're going through a major depression like I was."

I'm a 5'5 120 lb female who started out on 25mgs, and eventually increased to 50mgs about a month later. Zoloft has made it to where I don't sleep for about 24 hours, then sleep for 14 hours, which is very inconvenient for everyone in my household. I break down hysterically sobbing for absolutely no reason, at completely random times. My overall mood has gotten slightly better, but I can't get happier than a certain level. I'm currently coming off of this medication, and it is hell. I'm nauseous and have a horrendous migraine which makes being near anyone difficult due to the sound and smells. This medication is just not for me, although so many others have given it fantastic reviews.

33$Condition: Depression$4/10/2015 9:06:17 PM$Reviewer: pandoralives, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I started taking this med when a severe illness ultimately cost me my job, and the feelings of dispair, inability to earn my living and a shakey support system made life pretty bad. My MD suggested Zoloft. The starting dose was way too high so we backed off to 100mg a day. I know many feel that 100 is even a high dose, but it worked For me. I've been on a 100-150mg dose for 10 years (depends on need) and I can truly say it saved my life. I've had some side effects, but none bad enough to discontinue the med.
What I see in many of these reviews is concerning. Any med is going to take a while to get the full effect, especially anti-depressants. Stopping after a week because of an initial effect is not getting the full benefit. Give it a chance, it might actually work. Also, there are many factors that can cause these side effects I'm seeing: other meds, age, pre existing issues. Be careful and talk to your MD, there might be a good reason for side effects and maybe it's not the Zoloft.
I think it's a great med. Of course it's not for everyone, but when it works it's a godsend!
Good luck to you all; I know what you're going thru."

Very happy and small things didnt bother me like they used to I became very laid back and chill. After about a month I leveled out and doctor increased my dose to 100mg, been on this for about 4 months and felt great however I started gaining weight, alot. being 5' and always in shape- I work out all the time and eat healthy and now jumping up to 115lbs which 10lb increase despite my heavy cardio was intese for me. I decreased my dosage back to 50mg and now trying to wean off all together. Trying to get pregnant so dropped it down to 25mg.. been off the medication for one week and I feel very sick. Dizzy and highly irritable and extremely emotional- crying and needy. I feel worse than before I started the medication. Any suggestions? I dont want to be on this if I get pregnant.

Nights sweats every night, sometimes sleepy all day, other times times tons of energy.  I had extreme anxiety which caused me too be underweight, starting weight before meds were 90lbs...4 months later...101 lbs.  Ferocious appetite and never full.

Over the next couple months, I noticed that my hair had gotten thinner. By December it was coming out in the handfuls. I have been off of Sertraline for 3 weeks now and have not seen any signs of improvement. Being a 20 year old female college student with very long hair, this was a huge deal for me. It resulted in cutting my hair 10 inches, just so that when my hair fell out, it wouldn't be in such long strands. I would consider this to be a severe side effect, considering it resulted in lowered self esteem and returning depression.

My day to day was getting so bad that I would cry at the drop of a hat, over practically nothing.  I was argumentative to everyone and always negative. My doctor started me on 25mg of Sertraline (generic) and its like the heavens have opened up. I'm so look much happier and positive. I very rarely cry if at all, and only when warranted.  I haven't had any side effects at all. I take it in the mornings when getting ready.  Part of the routine.  I can't believe I was so stubborn all those years. I'm sure I missed out on a lot of life.  My OCD is reduced, my social anxiety is reduced, I'm finding that I'm even becoming more bold in trying new things.  I took a flight from California to Texas by myself which I would have NEVER done prior to taking this medicine.  EVER!.  LIFE IS GREAT NOW!

My moodiness, irritability, sadness, and anxiousness are much more controlable and I feel like I can cope with life now.  However, it is not without side-effects.  The first 3 weeks I had diarrhea and headaches, but not major enough to stop trying it.  After a month, the cloud lifted and I started enjoying life again.  Six months later, though, other side effects such as loss of libido crept in.  I have never had a problem maintaining my weight, and have always had a fast metabolism. After  18 months on this drug I have gained 15 pounds (all within the last 6 months).  So, it's a tradeoff.  Life is not perfect, but it's good...

Well I have learned that is not true. I was feeling so depressed and useless. Cried about nothing and everything. Dr. put me on 25mg. Zoloft and within a few days I felt like a new person.That was a little over a year ago.No side effects, not weight gain, stomach problems nothing. Everyone is different.I'm wondering if some of the problem is Dr's over medicating at the start. I have not had to up my dosage. My life is so much better since I started taking zoloft.No more crying about every little thing. It has been a life saver for me.Again may not be the same for everyone.I am now a young 80 yrs. old.

My day to day life has changed from a constant battle to a breeze. Now I finally feel my normal self again, I realise how anxious and depressed I was. I am a intelligent high functioning person that still got by on shear will power. I have been taking it 2 months and only take 3/4 of a 50mg Sertraline.
I am a different, relaxed, happy person. I sleep well, I think clearer, I want to do stuff again. Its amazing what this drug has done for me.

I started on half a tablet 25 mg a day and had major side effects, felt ill, got more depressed then ever, didnt sleep at all, felt sick, massive headaches, diarrhoea, very, very down, it was aweful...Just because some reviews told me to not give up and a supportive partner I pulled through...it took over 2 weeks to lessen these side effects and probably 3-4 weeks to really start to notice this huge dark cloud to lift..

START ON A LOW DOSE AND GIVE THIS DRUG TIME, DON'T JUDGE IT IN THE FIRST 2-4 weeks!!!

61$Condition: Depression$4/24/2014 4:42:23 PM$Reviewer: Kate, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have struggled with an eating disorder, anxiety and very bad depression with suicidal thoughts for 4+ years. When I got to my lowest point I decided to try anti-depressants. Like most people, I was afraid that it would make me numb, emotionless, etc, but that didn't happen at all. I started out with 50mg a day. Once I had been taking them for a few weeks I already felt a difference in how I look at myself and other people (my family and boyfriend) noticed it too. Several months into taking Zoloft I hit a plateau. When I told my doctor that, she said that was very normal and upped my dosage to 100mg. The only negative side effect I have experienced is the night sweats ONCE IN A WHILE. Yes, they are uncomfortable and it's annoying to wake up feeling cold, but really clammy and sweaty, but the positive effects of the drug outweigh the negative sides in my opinion. My depression also interfered with my sleeping pattern. I would go through a couple days to a week or more of being so fatigued ALL the time and sleeping way more than I should, and then other times where I am so restless that I continuously toss and turn in bed and finally give up and just stay up all night. So, my doctor prescribed me Trazodone (helps with insomnia and is an anti-depressant) to take along with Zoloft. These two drugs together have worked very well for me regarding general depression symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, disordered eating, etc. 
62$Condition: Depression$4/22/2014 11:18:02 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$5$I was given this drug in order to deal with the death of my fiance. Once I took it, I was emotionless. I could not cry to save my life. That is not how I want to feel. I need to release this hurt and now it is being blocked. I feel strange. I know that the need to cry is there, but by it being trapped, it is making me anxious and jittery. I am able to sleep, but when I awaken, I feel distant. I feel like my body is not mine. I am not sure what the intended effect of this medication is suppose to be, but I do not like the way it makes me feel. I was given 50mg and told to start off with 1/2 (25mg). The 25mg seems to be too much for me. The day of the funeral, I know I was being looked at because of my lack of tears. They just would not come out. I was like a zombie going through the motions. I am trying to get a hold of someone to see whether or not I am able to get on something more balancing. I feel as though I am about to have a panic attack.

I'm smaller, so I got the lowest dosage (50mg) and cut that in half, so i was taking 25mg/day. I was fine for the first two weeks, but then when the third (this week) hit, my depression stooped to a new low. My arms are literally covered in really bad s/h cuts(more like gashes) and I tried to hang myself twice. If you are small and young, DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. It made me tired all the time to the point of hardly being able to function, and despite my huge appetite and constant eating I lost 5 lbs in TWO days. I went from 108 lbs to 103 lbs. I keep getting wicked headaches, I keep hurting myself, and I've seemed to lose all self control. Zoloft has made my life a living hell. It's terrible. 
76$Condition: Depression$1/16/2014 1:35:27 PM$Reviewer: Julia S., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$I was prescribed Zoloft for postpartum depression after my second child was born.  Within days I had awful side effects - sweats, chills, nausea, headaches.  I tried it for a few weeks and then went to my PCP.  She said that I'd have to quit nursing and go on tricyclics, and that breastfeeding wasn't a big deal, formula is fine.  Note to self: don't listen to PCPs when it comes to antidepressants!  For a new mom with PPD, that was the worst thing to say.  I went sobbing to my therapist, who promptly squeezed me in to see a psychiatrist.  She explained that each SSRI is different, and that we'd try meds until we found something that worked.  She switched me to Celexa immediately, and as I tapered off Zoloft, the side effects disappeared.  I did have problems when I came off Celexa, but the key is if one med doesn't work for you, try another - AND work with a good psychiatrist not a PCP when it comes to medication.

After 3 months and 100mg dose per day up from 50mg which didn't do anything, I started getting extremely extremely ill. Now, I will note that for about a month or so I felt a huge difference and It was effective in reducing my anxiety/depression however the side effects ending up being detrimental. I had to have an endoscopy (camera down throat to see stomach) to prove the medication irritated my stomach. Zoloft caused extreme nausea, no appetite. It was horrible, and I threw up for 2 months ever morning because I was taking the zoloft before I went to bed. Long story short, the drug caused excess stomach acid to build up, created irritation, and made me throw up for months and feel waves of nausea hit me like a brick in the middle of the day. After being off of it for 1-2 months my stomach is still not back to its normal calm state. I have switched to Remeron which so far is helping (very mildly) but with zero side effects! It is helping my appetite since the zoloft made me on the verge of being extremely underweight, and I was already thin to begin with. Also, I currently take ""lansoprazole"" which works wonders for me (prilosec doesn't work for me)it is a 24 hour acid reducer. Anxiety and Depression pills cause so many GI issues.

80$Condition: Depression$12/28/2013 3:48:02 AM$Reviewer: pharm free, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I have taken Zoloft twice, about five years apart, and while it did pull me out of a huge slump, it caused at least a 20 lb weight gain both times. I am normally average weight, sometimes leaning toward underweight, and I eat pretty healthily, although I do pig out here and there. But I have never been overweight. At least until Zoloft. I gained 20 lbs the first time, and almost 30 the second, and both times the weight was hell to lose. I've been off it for a year now and am back to my regular size, but it took 5 months of strict low-carb dieting and vigorous exercise to get to this point. And that was after 4 months of just being med-free and letting my body go back to normal. It screwed with my metabolism, and it takes a while to bounce back. It did help my depression, it just made me feel horrible about myself. I've been taking 100mg 5HTP daily for 7 months along with rhodiola rosea. For the first 2 weeks, 5htp made me sleepy, but now, it's better than Zoloft. And it curbs my appetite! I feel great and normal and I'm so happy to be off pharms and still feeling good. I'm passionate about my hobbies again, something that I still lacked even on Zoloft.

And it has worked beautifully. I feel ten times better. No more sadness, suicidal thoughts, lack of motivation, none of that. The only negative about Zoloft or probably any antidepressant is that when you first start taking it you go down before you go up. Also the firsr month or so you will feel pretty mellowed out. Not down but not really up either. It's not a bad feeling it just kind of took me by surprise. But really after being on Zoloft for five months my life has drastically improved. It's worth a try.

The main source of this is my issues with weight. When I first started taking zoloft it was amazing. It was as if I had always had half a glass of wine in me. But, I put on 20 pounds. If weight is your issue, do not take this drug, the cravings were out of control. I switched to lexapro. The cravings went away but so did my ability to not over-eat. I would eat until something was gone. Now, I need to talk to my doctor about phentermine. It was nice to take a break from reality but now I'm a size 14.

193$Condition: Depression$10/5/2012 10:10:47 AM$Reviewer: GeorgiaPeach, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been struggling with post-partum depression since the birth of my child almost 8 months ago.  I initially refused medication because I was breastfeeding and worried it would affect my child.  I was very tired and sluggish all the time, and had occasional bad days when I felt like I was just down in a hole and all I wanted to do was sleep.  Even on the best days I was chronically tired.  I often felt complete disinterest in my child, and I lost interest in my hobbies- riding my horses seemed like too much work, and I was way too tired to even consider exercising.

I also had trouble with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by even routine daily tasks.  I had a lot of irrational guilt as well.

Zoloft literally changed my life overnight.  I feel 100% normal, the way I did before I ever got pregnant.  1 50mg zoloft a day has worked wonders.  I was afraid I'd feel doped up but all I feel is normal.  I have my normal energy level back, I'm enjoying my baby, I'm riding my horses again, it's wonderful.

I was afraid after reading the bad reviews that this medicine would give me bad side effects, but so far  have not experienced any side effects at all.  I strongly encourage anyone suffering from depresion to give this medicine a chance- it might work just as well for you as it has for me.  I wish I had started taking it months ago.  "

201$Condition: Depression$7/11/2012 5:29:20 PM$Reviewer: noscreenname, 35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$" I started taking Zoloft for help with deep depression. I also had a cocaine habit which contributed to the deep depressed state I was in. As a bonus it completely curbed any craving for cocaine. It was like Chantix would do for a smoker only it didn't take seven days to work. It worked as soon as the Zoloft took effect. I am not sure if any doctor has been made aware of this extra benefit. If not I hope a doctor or a pharmaceutical rep reads this and researches this so Zoloft can be used in treatment for addictive disorders as well as a treatment for depression.

It's hard to wean off of but I found that decreasing the dose very slowly helped. I could reduce to 50 mg with no problems and used that as my starting point. Then I would reduce the dosage by approximately 12.5 mg (by cutting the pills up) for each two-week stage. So it was 50 mg for 2 weeks, 37.5 mg for 2 weeks, 25 mg for 2 weeks,etc. I still had some dizziness but it wasn't quite as bad as when I followed the recommended protocol for weaning off!
206$Condition: Depression$6/19/2012 6:34:21 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$This is the first anti depressant I ever took and my body's reaction to it should have been a warning for me against any meds. I took one pill, a very low dosage maybe 10mg, during a stay in a hospital psychiatric ward back in 2006. Soon after I began having very intense visual hallucinations. My doctor was notified at once and the medication stopped. He informed me that it was a rare, but serious, side effect of Zoloft and to never take it again because long term the hallucinations may become permanent. It seems my body is incredibly sensitive to psychiatric meds, especially anti depressants, as I have always had severe reactions to them. Eventually, I learned to work through my depression and anxiety and PTSD without the use of meds(therapy only) and am much happier now.

It pulled straight through and out of a severe depression, but the drowsiness and effects it has on memory and concentration were I believe the cause of two very problematic things - first a car accident which if it weren't for the safety features of our vehicles, I and a family of 5 could have easily been killed.  Zoloft helped me through the storm of the insurance claims which could have easily spiralled me into suicidal depression...I had to get a new job to pay for the costs of the accidents and on my job due to the complaints of my new manager about my frequent mistakes and inability to remember important job procedures, I almost lost my new job, and unfortunately that is still a looming possibility.  I just think Zolofts side effects are now causing the types of problems that cause my depression, so I am going to switch to Wellbutrin and see if my situation improves.  Zoloft has been my best medical friend, but maybe not.

He doubled the dosage and it didnt help. I han irriable bowel symdrome and I gained 65 pounds.  I was hungry all the time.I finally had to make up stuff to see a psychiatrist and he said, if I had gotten to him sooner I would not have gained all that weight! I still have 50 pounds left to lose. The IBS has stopped and I was put on effexor and wellbutrin but that is not for everyone. See an expert for help in these medications.  It appears it was my dopamnine was a problem  not so much my seratonin.  Family doctors are not well versed in treating depression and the side effects  of these drugs. My psychiatrist gave me a new lease on life after suffering for years. However my friend took wellbutrin and became severely depressed but was better after quitting it.
So see an expert about psychiatric drugs!"

Anxiety & depression are part of this as well. My psych started me with 50mg Zoloft, 25mg Hydroxyzine for anxiety. Went back for my follow up, and didn't really see any significant improvements so he increased Zoloft to 100mg. Well the 100mg gave me the shakes in my hands really bad and it became unbearable, so I went back and he put me back on Zoloft 50mg then added 75mg Effexor XR. So far I am happy with this combination. I still get a couple of crying spells but not too bad. I noticed I am able to get through stressful situations and other things that would have previously had me through the roof with anxiety. You just have to find the right combination with your psych, it might take several meds to get your combo down but it can work if you give it a chance! :)

I noticed a positive difference within a week. It has a sedative effect, therefore has helped with my 'insomnia' that I have been battling for yrs. (I was probably depressed due to ongoing stressful issues for the past 10 yrs & did not realize it).Also am now taking Amytriptaline 10mgm @ bedtime if I need it.(this also helps with sleep).
I believe that it has lifted my mood (I felt tremendous sadness & hopelessness most days...& cried all the time).Zoloft (Sertraline) has helped me. I don't cry as
I did before, also have more energy to do everyday activities. Before the meds I did not feel like doing anything..could have stayed in my pj's all day..had no interest in anything. Now I have more energy & I am better equipped to deal with our high stress issues. My daughter has noticed a difference also. I do not like to be dependant on meds. but in my case, I feel it has been a dramatic change for the better. My doctor feels that I should stay on the Zoloft for 9 to 12 months...then we will discuss if I should stop. He suggested that I increase the dose, but I declined this for now because I feel better. I will also see a therapist. As for the weight..I have gained 3 lbs, too early to say I guess...but I think I get more enjoyment out of life now...I had lost my appetite before & had lost 4 lbs.As for my libido..it was not good before...now I believe I may be regaining some interest..probably too early to say.

242$Condition: Depression$12/6/2011 3:10:26 AM$Reviewer: tiredlady, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$3$"I started taking Zoloft when I was in high school and it worked very very well for me. I was feeling depressed but didn't know exactly what was wrong with me, I just knew that I was sleeping through EVERYTHING and was going through some hard times. I was on the medication for three years and it worked well, etc. 

I started taking the medication again after 4 years and there are some things about it that I do not remember from the first time around. The medication will give you very bad nausea if you do not take it regularly and with food so beware. However, this wore off for me after a few weeks. You also may have problems sleeping, but overall the reviews are very spot on. In just a couple of days you feel much better and have the motivation to not only stay on the medication but get other things done too! I'm not sleeping 24/7 anymore. However, also like the reviews I've experienced a lack of libido and in the past very very vivid dreams."

I am sleeping better, happier and easier to be around.  The one side effect I am having are the vivid dreams.  No big deal. I wish I would of started this a year ago when my doctor suggested it.  If it doesn't work for you then talk to your doctor and start something else, no one is making you take a drug that you don't want to be on.

It began to work with the very first dose and still prevents the chronic depression that has plagued me for the last 20 years. I take 100 mg each morning. Other than a significantly decreased libido, the only side effects that I am aware of was aggitation when I failed to take the medicine (Zoloft). I had much anxiety and the whizzes so I just got my prescription re-filled. My doctor has informed me that Viibryd might be just as effective as the Zoloft without the side effects that might happen with long term use of the Zoloft. I am very apprehensive about discontinuing a med that has worked so well?

It helps me feel less anxious and my sleep becomes very regular, however the reason that I quit taking it is because it makes me feel like a zombie emotionally and because of the sexual side effects. I would take it again if I became depressed, but it's not a drug that I could take long-term anymore; The side effects are not worth it. I have found that walking outdoors and writing in a journal works nearly as well on the depression, but doesn't work for my insomnia that much and does nothing for the social anxiety.

Was successfully TREATED FOR 2-3 YRS during that time went up to 150mg from 50mg start.  Then NO MEDICAL INSUR and health clinic wouldn't prescribe BRAND had to pay $50/mth to get it SO COULDN'T and stopped cold turkey (DON'T REMEMBER ANY HORRIBLE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS though).  This time started with generic at 25mg for ANXIETY (more prominent currently).  GREAT SEDATIVE SIDE EFFECT of sleeping for 12 hrs a day EASED my ANXIETY (pain in chest, lump in throat, rapid heartbeat, nervousness, can't focus on anything to get it done) but made me tired when awake and forgetful for those 1st 2 weeks.  THE DOSE FOR TREATING DEPRESSION IS 50mg so now on BRAND for last 2 weeks and have HAD TERRIBLE UPPER BACK PAINS AND SPASMS; right after took dose nightly got great ANXIETY but it subsided after an hour; NAUSEA right after dose (2 TUMS helps); has REDUCED my GREAT APPETITE (usually overeating is due to an imbalance in brain chemistry) and I'm able to make healthier choices at regular mealtimes (REDUCTION in impulsivity OCD); does help me SLEEP DEEPER at night (need at least 8 hrs)  but is DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF BED in the morning (quick 1 cup of coffee and ready to go though); body PAINS I suffer from past injuries are EASED during the night which is a another welcome side effect not having to use additional meds.  I see alot of bad sexual side effects from other users reviews but I'm here to say, as it was years ago, there is some loss of normal sensitivity but ORGASMS ARE VERY INTENSE once you get there. I also remember great euphoria effect from serotonin (that's what I'm aiming for again) can't say that has kicked in yet but do feel relief and LIFE SEEMS LIVABLE for someone who has battled depression/anxiety/OCD since late teens."

I have had depressed symptoms since my teen years and was first diagnosed with clinical depression at age 15, then at 17 I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I also have photosensitive epilepsy, which sometimes makes pretty down, so Zoloft helps that out. I think I've been on this medication now for about 4 or 5 years now. I have tried Celexa, Abilify, Remeron, and Effexor. Abilify made me go really quite well, psychotic and sick and Effexor stopped working after a while of being on it.

I noticed right away I was feeling better, mentally more calm and less stressed throughout the day when I normally am very stressed at work. I am really happy about that! I have been dealing with depression/anxiety/stress for 13 years since the death of my mother. I am an only child and always just very nervous/worried about my life in general, just unhappy. I was also sick with a virus when I began taking Zoloft, so I did feel bad from the sickness (the Dr thought I was sick from stress, but I am still recovering from a sore throat and still on antiobiotics and steriods too). I have been experiencing the jaw-clenching and waking up with my hair wet in the morning from having night sweats. I think I was talking in my sleep last night as if someone was in my apartment, but I live alone with my dog. I faintly remember having a conversation with someone, lol. Can someone will these side effects go away with further use? My teeth hurt from all of the jaw-clenching :( I so sleep better overall (I take Trazodone to help with sleep and this makes it work alot better because I was not sleeping very well with it before due to stress). I am overall happy with it so far, I just do not like the jaw-clenching and night sweats/talking. I don't want to end up sleepwalking or anything dangerous like that.

I finally went off birth control several months ago and after a few months was still having significant PMDD, so I finally submitted to being put on a Zoloft prescription. I took a low dose (50 mg) and it really helped me with anxiety and depression, cutting the days of the month that I was depressed down from 5-7 to maybe a half a day or one day.

The problem was, I gained a LOT of weight (25 pounds in six months), despite working out 5-6 times a week and eating relatively healthy.  There were no changes in my diet or exercise, the Zoloft was the only thing that could be causing it.  If it was just five or ten pounds I could handle it, but I increased exercise and cut down on food intake and I was still gaining, and my doctor told me that it is a commom side effect and it would probably be very difficult for me to lose the weight while still on the medication.

I'm now weaning off the Zoloft because I want to try managing the depression with vitamins (first try will be fish oil and a B-complex).  I don't mean to sound vain but the weight gain was making me depressed as well as uncomfortable in my clothes and my own skin!

I hope this is helpful for someone who is considering taking Zoloft for PMDD - I think it's worth exhausting other options before getting on it because of the weight gain.  But if I don't find the vitamins and supplements helping I will get back on it, I've had no other side effects from it besides some mild dizziness from time to time. "

There were days when I would stay in my sweats and just watch all tv all day. Now I'm finally feeling like myself waking up happy and wanting to actually do things again. It took a very long time to work for me, so be patient if you don't see antyhing right away. I'm glad I stuck with it. The only side effect for me is in the bedroom dept. Never been a problem before but having those ""fireworks"" now are near impossible or take FOREVER. But thats not the end of the world I guess. Otherwise I haven't had any other problems. I would like to move up to 200mg, but my doctor wants me to wait a bit. She kept telling me it takes time and I was starting to lose help, but finally I am feeling better. I would recommend this if you are thinking of tyring it. "

His whole personality changed for the worse, his business failed, he became someone else and almost lost everything in his life. His doctor never asked anything more than how ya doing and kept rewriting the prescriptions. It was awful. He weaned himself off and we are back together and seeking therapy. The thing is, he couldn't see the changes in himself. He kept doing more and more risky behavior, including jumping out of airplanes and riding really fast on motorcycles. Just to 'feel' something. The same with the affair and prostitutes, it was more for the 'danger' and 'forbidden' feeling than anything else. It was a horrible 6 years and now he says he has a clarity he hasn't had in almost a decade.

This was so severe, I couldn't hold down a sip of water or roll over in bed. My PCP sent me for more tests than I can remember. I was losing my mind.  The PCP, GI specialist & shrink said it couldn't be this drug. Even my gy/obn couldn't give me an answer. My stomach was distending. Why? No answer. I went on an out of town trip, ran out of my prescription, and within 3 days my symptoms of vomiting went from 15 to 5 times a day. This was 2000 or 2001.  It must have taken another 6 months before this side effect quit.  Research tells me the distention is one of the first signs of diabetes, which is rabid in my family. My doctor had my medical history. Research also said that children get diabetes due to excessive vomiting during a childhood illness!  So now I'm diabetic, more depressed because my remaining son died, will never take anything for depression and barely do anything a doctor tells me.  I wouldn't wish this on the devil. If I could star ratings would be in the negative.

The reason that I know it is a chemical imbalance is because I have a very stressfree and happy life otherwise.  When I went into my depression I was crying everyday and I could not get up and do anything, everthing I tried to do like loading the dishwasher or blowdrying my hair felt like I was trying climbMt.Everst The night I started taking 50 mg of zoloft the crying stopped immediatly the next day, had flat feelings for a couple of weeks, then slowly but surely everyday I could tell a difference and today 1 month later I feel great now! Back to normal.  I will never stop taking zoloft.  I love it!  Hope this helps someone

Once I got through the initial side effects and the dosage was in the appropriate therapeutic range my depression vanished. I don't feel like a spaced-out zombie! I feel like myself-the way I always thought I should feel before severe clinical depression got in the way. No problem dealing with the weight gain-I am alive and functioning and that is way more important than worrying about my size. Now I exercise regularly and have made new friends! I encourage those suffering from depression to speak with an appropriate health care provider to investigate the possibility of taking anti-depressants. Sertraline doesn't work for everyone but with a little patience perhaps the right meds can be found. The difference it makes might be very pleasantly surprising!

I have experienced very little in the way of side effects; the downside for me has been loss of libido. However, for something to help with the depression, it's worth it.

From the first day, I promptly took a nap the moment it kicked in. I am so tired all the time! I don't feel like I can ever get enough sleep and when I'm awake I feel like a zombie most of the day! The nausea has mostly gone away now (I did throw up on the 3rd day) but I also still have no appetite. I don't salivate for anything so its almost painful to try and eat anything other than yogurt or soft foods that go down easily. I took effexor some years ago and never experienced any side effects like this, but that drug made me crazy. Moodwise, this drug has helped keep me stable and stress free. I don't cry all the time any more and i no longer have suicidal thoughts. but will these side effects ever go away? the whole purpose of me taking this is to live a happier life so i can be productive and enjoy things again. the point is lost if all i ever want to do is sleep!

Celexa(40-60 mg) did help me some, but I seemed to kind of plateu in my progress after 6-7 months.  Since starting on the Zoloft there is a noticeable difference in my mood and ability to focus and concentrate.  I should also note that I'm taking Wellbutrin in combination with the Zoloft as I was with the Celexa.  I have not noticed any side effects form the Zoloft yet and, in fact, some of what were apparently side effects of the Celexa (dry mouth, heavy sweating) have disappeared.  I know everyone's biochemistry is different, but so far so good with the Zoloft for me!

The only withdrawal symptoms I experienced were a slight headache with minimal dizziness. Nothing that stopped me from doing my daily routine. It seemed when I was on the medication, I was always tired, never wanting to do or go anywhere because I never felt good physically. 
I began not to care about my hygiene or anything else in my life. I also had to rely on ex-lax for constipation not to mention, my sex life had completely diminished. But I was happy mentally, or at least I thought I was. Since stopping, I have lost weight because I am now moving my bowels regularly. I also regained 'feeling' down there and am happy to report, I have no trouble reaching climax. What's bizarre beyond comprehension is that it seemed as though Zoloft made me numb from all that mattered in life. I wish I had the words to describe how truly happy I am now that I stopped. It's like the ole' happy me is back .. and better than ever.  I wonder how many others out there now, were just like me, feeling happy yet not realizing that the medication was having a terrible effect on day to day events.
Good luck to everyone  :)"

I felt so bad for my husband because sex was our best test for compatability. After getting off Z. I lost 60 lbs. in about 1 yr. and became sexually healthy again. I would not take this drug for anything again. I now take Cymbalta. My depression is from being chronically ill since birth. I am now 58 yrs. and have been in chronic pain since I was 26 yrs. old. When I finally found a doctor that knew what he was doing he put me on an anti-dep., AM and PM, time released pain pills, and meds., for break through pain, we tried other parts of the puzzle but found this to work pretty well. I would give my right arm to not be in pain and not suffer from depression. Yes, the 2 go hand  in hand and I too have had people tell me it is in my head. Wrong. I now take Cymbalta and I love it.

It numbed any and all feelings, so I was unable to function as a ""normal"" human being.

It has been 7 years since I took Zoloft and I am STILL HAVING SEVERE NOSE BLEEDS. I have to take supplements so that I don't bleed to death!
These depression medications DO NOT FIX THE PROBLEM THAT IS CAUSING THE DEPRESSION and the Doctor's don't care, just as long as they can make their money from doling out these deadly prescriptions.
A lot of depression is caused by OUR DIET and some is caused by something TEMPORARY in our living conditions.
We--as Human Beings--need to take more control of our bodies and for our own health. There is so much information out there to help us, if a person would just look it up on the internet.
I think it is WRONG to BLINDLY TRUST a DOCTOR just because he IS a DOCTOR. after all, he is HUMAN, and he may have graduated medical school at the BOTTOM of his class.  He also may not be keeping up with all the NEW research--I personally have had several Doctors who DID NOT.
When are WE THE PEOPLE going to wake up and realize that we are being"" LEGALLY""-  ""MADE ILL"" -AND- ""KILLED"" by Doctors and Hospitals?
 My advice--DO NOT CAUSE YOURSELF MORE PROBLEMS BY TAKING ZOLOFT OR ANY DRUGS FOR DEPRESSION.
Find a Doctor who actually wants to treat the CAUSE of
your problem!!  Think about it--they CANT GET RICH IF THEY CURE YOU---they get rich if they can KEEP YOU COMING BACK!  COMMON SENSE!!

408$Condition: Depression$10/10/2010 10:36:39 AM$Reviewer: Kms, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$4$I started taking 50mg 1 week after having my youngest son. Gradually increased dose, now at 200mg (100mg twice daily). I've lost 50+lbs in 6 months (40 of it was from the pregnancy). I still feel a lot of anxiety and depression... I dont have any energy. Really severe headaches (where my brain feels like it's swelling) and occasional nausea. The worst part is NO SEX DRIVE at ALL!! I've been having really bizarre dreams, causing loss of sleep which contributes to my anxiety and headaches. I am still breast-feeding so I have limited options... I'm trying to decide which is worse... All these side effects or feeling depressed and anxious all the time....???

Ive been on it for about a year and ive started to develop an immunity to it. 

Ive found that the dark feelings are coming back and im starting crying for no good reason again. 

Im changing to Cymbalta to see if it helps but only time will tell

Zoloft is really good but it depends on the person and how their body reacts to it because someone i know was on it and they had really bad pyscotic episodes. "

I didn't really have a weight gain, which I was nervous about, but I noticed if I didn't take it with food it made me EXTREMELY sick.  I'm on Welbutrin now, I'm hoping that works.

With the Zoloft I experienced a lot of fatigue and abnormally dulled emotion. I also gained 30 lbs. during the three months I was on Zoloft (while exercising regularly and maintaining my already healthy eating habits), which is why I finally went off of it. It wasn't until I stopped taking Zoloft that I realized how detrimental it was to my overall well-being and how little it actually helped my depression. The weight gain and constant fatigue caused my self-confidence to plummet, and on top of that it didn't stop me from falling into intense periods of desolation. It's still a struggle for me to get through every day with moderate depression, but it's better without Zoloft.

I have taken zoloft twice for depression in the last four years. (I do not suffer from anxiety attacks.) It has worked both times, though it takes awhile. The first few weeks it improves the quality of my sleep, and then it gradually lifts my mood until I am almost) my old cheery self. I am thankful for zoloft.  However, I have experienced some side effects:  first and foremost, diarrhea - which has slowed over time but still have some stomach irritation. (At one point the pharmacy switched generics and the diarrhea stopped completely.) Also, it has reduced my sex drive and ability to orgasm - my doc suggested I take a break from zoloft on the weekends and that has helped.(This could be a worse problem for younger couples with a more spontaneous sex life, but it works for us.) I have NOT experienced nausea, skin outbreaks, tremors. I am pleased with zoloft and feel fortunate that it has worked for me. It has helped my brother and my dad too. From reading the reviews, it seems that it is not as helpful for depression with anxiety. Also, I recommend patience when you first start taking it - it takes awhile to get the full benefit. I have recently added fish oil and aerobic exercise (Curves three days a week for 1/2 an hour) - and make sure I get as much light and sunshine as possible. It is important to socialize too - even if you have to force yourself. Good luck to all of you.

think that I didn't need the medication any longer so I would stop taking it, and always my depression would return. So in the end as long as I  stay on the medication I remain in an optimistic attitude."

Worked great initially.  I became calm (no more flying off the handle) enjoyed my kids so much and they me and my social anxiety was mostly gone.  I stayed on it through my first 2 trimesters of pregnancy and went off for the last (had many panic attacks of feeling that I wasn't able to breathe, partly because of pregnancy and magnified by stopping Zoloft cold turkey.)  Went back on it 3 weeks after daughter was born but it just never worked as well as it did previously.  I eventually started feeling very foggy and started having short term memory problems.  Adding 5htp and tyrosine helped.  The big thing too my appetite started getting out of control... thought about food constantly and craved sweets all the time which caused me to gain 10 lbs.  Went off of 50 mg cold turkey.  Have been off of it about 2.5 months.  Has been tough and very on and off.  Started taking 5htp and tyrosine and starting to feel more leveled out.  I read that long term Zoloft use can affect your metabolism.  I'm hoping I can lose some weight and won't hesitate to try antidepressants again if I really need them (hope I can lose some weight first though..) Great at first, but long term can have a weight gain a foggy thinking effect. Eventually would probably have to be enhanced by Wellbutrin or Ambilify especially with the foggy thinking.

However, the downfall is that my skin is much worse.  I'm not certain it's the drug and don't see that anyone else has cited an incrase in breakouts due to the drug, but my skin used to be clear until taking this.  I went off of it for about a month and did notice that I felt much grumpier, felt the weight coming back on and miraculously my skin cleared up to perfection.  I guess it's a tough call.

It worked well for helping my mood, but it strongly affected my desire to have sex. My depression worsened six months into treatment due to extreme psychological trauma. The doctor increased my dose to 50 mg. I experienced my first ever manic episode at 30 years old. My doctor ordered me to stop taking it immediately. Since then, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Specified). I have been free from psychiatric medication for three years. Unfortunately, a steroid used for treating H1N1 induced a brief manic period in me as well. No more Zoloft for me now but bipolar disorder for life. I don't blame the Zoloft, though. Even though I hadn't had any other mood episodes, BPD runs in my family. I think the Zoloft just helped it come to the surface.

Long story short, I stopped myself from taking every pill I could find cuz I then had to remember that I have to take care of my baby.  So, I called a psych crisis line and they sent out the cops and paramedics.  Then they all forced me to go to the hospital and then after 4 hours, I was released.

517$Condition: Depression$4/1/2010 9:57:22 PM$Reviewer: equsole, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Tried taking this several years ago when I was in my early twenties and it made my depression worse. I've been on several different antidepressants since then and when my last one stopped working I took some time off from antidepressants (about 7 months). My OB/GYN suggested Zoloft because it is the safest one to take for pregnancy (I'm not pregnant yet, but have been trying). Well, I took it for 3 days - started on 25mg and on the 4th day I woke up have a severe panic attack that lasted all morning. I decided not to take my dose that day and later in the evening I started having dizzy spells and visual disturbances (twinkling stars and black spots) followed by a migraine. Needless to say, I will no longer be taking Zoloft. Also, it is no worse or better to take during pregnancy than any other of the antidepressants available; like most antidepressants it is riskier to take it during the last trimester...and knowing how bad the withdrawal symptoms are for this drug, I would not think this is a good drug to take during a pregnancy. I am experimenting with herbal supplements right now - I highly recommend wild oat extract (from Bach), a raw B-vitamin complex, and fish oil extract (high quality).

I have taken it ever since, with the exception of two periods, when I was misdiagnosed as being bi-polar.  For single-pole depression, Zoloft works for me.  I do not intend to change meds again.  However, the latest generic versions do NOT seem to be as effective.  Quality control is an issue, here, and I've had to double up on my dosage a few times.  Otherwise, Zoloft is MY SSRI.

Before Zoloft I had tried many different meds, none worked as well as zoloft does. I take 200mg everyday and another medicine for anxiety it's grerat being independant again and able to hold down a job and take care of my child like a mom should. before I found Zoloft my life was a mess it's still one day at a time but it is well worth it. as far as side effects go I did notice headaches some in the begining but over time side effects went away. I don't ever want to change meds again. Zoloft is not for everyone just like prozac wasn't for me it made me ill and mean if you Zoloft is right for you you will be able to tell i think within a month of being on it it was like night and day after i got to full strength dosage. I went from sleeping all the time and forgetting to eat for days to living a healthy normal life. If other meds have not worked for you i would reccomend trying Zoloft at least once to see if it is what you need.

I am no longer angry, stressed, nervous, and depressed all of the time. People actually describe me as laid back! It not only helped my depression but pretty much did away with my constant anxiety. I have friends now, a great fiancee, I speak in front of people, and hold a managerial position. All of these things would have been impossible in my previous condition. The only unfavorable side effects I have experienced are tiredness and loss of sex drive. For those reasons I went from 100 mg to 50 mg and the side effects improved.

First I started at 50mg and had it increased to 75mg because of lingering depression symptons. I have to admit that I feel great since starting this medication. Im still not 100% but it's getting there. The only side effect that I've found is that I have crazy lucid dreams which I actually don't mind as long as they aren't scary but that is rare. This morning I actually woke up laughing because the dream I was having was funny. I only wish that the tablet came in 75mg dose instead of having me break a tablet in half every morning to get the extra 25 mg.

551$Condition: Depression$2/10/2010 11:37:39 PM$Reviewer: Ronsword, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I feel like the odd man out as most reviews of Zoloft seem to be very positive. I'm not knocking the drug, but have to report on my experiences with it; they were awful. About one week after treatment on 50mg, I started developing tremor and felt very agitated. The jitters were bad---feeling like I'd just drunk 5 cups of coffee. Side effects worsened and after 3 weeks, I experienced really bad anxiety, like nothing I'd ever experienced before. It was as if a part of my mind was spinning out of control and I was helpless to do anything about it. It was clearly a bad reaction to sertraline because I've never in my 53 years experienced that type of bizarre anxiety. I know full well what panic attacks are, and I've dealt with varying degrees of anxiety for decades. But this was completely new to me and scared the living hell out of me.  After switching to Celexa, my side effects almost immediately abated and my depression lifted within several weeks of therapy. So the moral of the story, obviously, is that everyone's brain receptors work differently, there is no test to determine the best drugs for those receptors, and so careful monitoring and switching of drugs when called for is the best and only course of action.

negative thoughts I use to have running continuously in my head. I don't think it has dulled my emotions. But, it has had a large negative effect on my sex drive. Hardly any desire though i am
over 70. I tried going without it for awhile but I started getting
the weird brain sensations from the lower Serotonin levels.
  Also the negative tapes started running again. 
So, the last 15 years have been much more enjoyable. I
would do it again.  The only thing comparable for me would
be Valium.
     But that's another story.

I started using opiate painkillers at age 14 and injecting opiates iv including heroin when I was 16. I tried to get off of opiates for 6 months by myself and finally decided to see a shrink. I was very depressed without opiates scaled 8/10 and anxiety on a level of 11/10. The shrink put me on zolft 50 for withdrawls and did nothing the first 2 days. on the third day of taking zoloft I got terrible cold sweats (along with opiate withdrawl cold sweats), and was sleeping less then before. I began getting 2 hours of sleep max, and I felt like a zombie. about 5 days after I stoped opiates, and started zoloft I started on suboxone (which is specifically for opiate withdrawls). my depression seemed to get better but I was still a zombie and was still very anxious. I stopped taking zolft after about a month and just taking suboxone. my depression and anxiety disapeared aswell as my night sweats and sleep problems. but the withdrawls from zolft were very scary and would creep up on me. all of the sudded I would get a crazy tingle down my arms and through my hands, I would get these 'brain zaps'like an electrical shock through my brain where I would blurt weird noises unintentionally. I would get about 10 'brain zaps' a day and were very very frightening. the brain zaps slowly disapated but I stil get them when falling asleep maybe once or twice a week. I have been off zolft for 2 months now and i am still having withdrawls. I will never take an anti-depressant again EVER! Beware of this med. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!

620$Condition: Depression$11/9/2009 11:48:30 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I was diagnosed with recurrent major depressive disorder and PTSD four years ago.  The cocktail that saved my life included Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Klonopin.  After years of cognitive therapy and EMDR I remembered how enjoying life felt, returned to practicing law, and dropped down to Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I started sliding recently and needed to add another antidepressant, so I went with the generic form of Zoloft due to Cymbalta's cost.  I got what I paid for.  Yes, I can at least grit my teeth to keep the tears back till I get home now, but the veil/grayness is still there.  I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone with severe, major depression - it's not adequate for the task.  I lost two more months of my life to the wretched disease, depression waiting for relief that never came.  I'm transitioning back to Cymbalta - my happiness is worth the expense.

It took about 4-6 weeks to really start working but it has definitely been a huge help to me. The past 2-3 weeks my symptoms have started returning, but so is winter, which is probably a big factor in the return of my symptoms. My doctor increased my dose to 100mg and I'm hoping it will make a difference. The only side effect I have noticed is night sweats, which have gotten better with time, but they are not severe and certainly manageable. I have not had any nausea or intestinal issues. I have a lot more energy and am finally starting to feel like myself again after years of struggling with depression.

625$Condition: Depression$11/3/2009 4:55:33 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I've been taking the generic (Sertraline) 25mg daily for around 2 yrs.  The reasoning behind beginning this was that depression runs in my family and also due to my job changing as I began traveling and living on the road.  I know there are others out there with similar conditions.  I am impressed with the drug but do see it for what it is as a band-aid.  It helps but does not correct the real root problem.  Prior to taking this I had never taken anything on a regular basis. My way of dealing with depression was with exercise and being out doors.  Now once again I am in a more controlled work environment and home everyday.  Soon I will begin regular exercise and discontinue use of this drug.  It has served its purpose well but I do not want to be dependant on anything except for food, water and shelter.  Only drawbacks that I have noticed are if I miss a dose - irritability and some anger but not depression??

I get worse around my period, and almost can't function in late winter.  I actually feel like I know I am supposed to feel on this medicine. NORMAL!! Anxiety, depression, major PMS, anger.. GONE! My patience, and concentration is a lot better too.  I am on the lowest dose, but I'm a small person, also, my doc did a blood draw and I was slightly anemic and low on Vit D.  So I am taking supplements for that. That may be helping me feel better too.  I had side effects the first few weeks, but nothing that wasn't tolerable.  BTW, I did go off this last year cuz I was feeling so much better, but when winter came, all the bad stuff came back and never went away.  I'll stay on it a little longer this time and hopefully get off and stay happy and normal... one day...

Been taking it for about 3 months and have had maybe 6 really bad days with nonstop crying I couldn't control, increased anxiety, extreme anger and irritability. Had to leave work once because I freaked out, couldn't stop crying, couldn't stop having really negative thoughts, I was angry, would have spat fire at people if I could, and had an urge so strong to hurt myself that I was afraid to be alone. It happened out of the blue and I still don't know why, maybe hormonal. Most days are good though. I was really weary about medicating for depression but most days it really helps.

It worked great in the beginning; however, it by far has the worst side effects such as weight gain, fatigue, loss of sexual interest.  I did take this while I was pregnant and my son who is 15 months old shows NO signs of any birth defects and/or side effects.  I am told it is one of the safest drugs to take during pregnancy.  I have recently been weaned off of Zoloft and switched to Wellbutrin - the withdrawal is a horrible process.  It was very hard to go thru withdrawl, work 40 hour work weeks and come home and be a mom and wife.  It lasted about 2-3 weeks and the withdrawl effects are severe anxiety, vertigo, severe mood swings and fatigue.  If you're considering this medication, seriously read up on it before taking it.  It does what its supposed to do, but are the side effects really worth it??

I am currently on 100mg in the morning plus clanezapam at .25mg in the morning and afternoon.  My depression kicked in the summer of 2008 when I moved to a new home and started a high stress job that I did not choose.  On top of that I was diagnosed with a heart condition that will most likely result in a valve replacement surgery down the road. I also went through about 2-3 months of therapy.  I am a totally different person today.  I was never socially active and I was having frequent panic attacks.  It is strange when you look back at it how you are in a deep hole and you fear that you will never get your life back.  I have gotten my life back with the help of Zoloft.  I highly recommend it to anyone suffering the same issues. You have to have faith and belief that you will overcome your depression.  It was hard at first getting out to do normal everyday things.  I forced myself to get out and do chores outside and my family was a great help.  I did try other drugs at first and Zoloft was my life saver. I plan an taking the rest of my life because I never want to be the person I was before, always anxious and never wanting to be around other people.

I took 100mg of Zoloft for seven years and for the most part felt great. The only side affect for me was how my doctor put it ""I couldn't get mt ticket punched during sex"". This simply would not do for me. Coming off the drug is difficult but can be done. Just ween yourself each week you are taking it to smaller doses by cutting the pills. You will get an strong feeling of dizziness and disorientation but it does pass within a short time. Maybe 2 weeks or so. Once u get past that point u will be fine. I now take Wellbutrin which does everything the Zoloft did minus the sexual side affect. Good luck people and if u want off this drug it isn't easy but it can be done. Just hang in there. I'm really proud of everyone who are taking steps to make their life happy and fulfilling for them and their family.

Oh one other thing...If u decide to switch drugs from one that isn't working for you to another you and your doctor want to try, it was my experience to ween yourself off the first drug a little before starting the new one. I told my doctor about my side affects with Zoloft and he immediately wanted me to start Celexa without getting some of the Zoloft about of my system....HUGE MISTAKE...don't do this...Cut your Zoloft dosage down to almost nothing then start the new one. When he had me just switch from one to the other within a day that really screwed me up. Just a word of advice.

I was actually contemplating suicide because of my inability to cope with some difficult circumstances. Zoloft literally saved my life. I take 200 mg every evening and do experience some sedation with it, also have had weight gain. But overall, I have had excellent results with this medicine.  Have tried generics - some work pretty well, some don't. They all have different ""fillers"" in them, and some pharmacies (especially the big mail-order one) do tend to buy the cheapest ones. I got one (made by Cobalt out of Canada) that I was actually allergic to.  It also had absolutely no effect as far as controlling my depression - I cried for 2 weeks on it - went back to brand Zoloft and was better in 2 days.  So if you have to take generic for insurance reasons be sure you get it from a reputable pharmacy and ask them what generics they use(there are lots for Zoloft).  When you find one that works for you, ask your doctor to always specify that particular generic when he writes your prescription. Best advice is to get a generic from a US company, as quality control standards are monitored better here. My experience has been that brand Zoloft is best,and it's worth the additional cost if you can manage it. I believe this medicine has been God's way of healing me from depression so that I can live a productive life, and I am grateful for it.    "

I plan to go up to the max of 200.I had suffered from depression and anxiety for over 8 years until I discovered this drug! This is the first time I have had any relief from my condition. There were side effects the first two weeks but mostly gone now. I still clench my teeth now and then. One side effect is good for our sex life: I am not as anxious about missing sex, and I don't have pre-mature ejaculation at all. Overall my drive has decreased, which is a good thing, really. I could be quite overwhelming at times. I was heavily addicted to pot from 14-32 yrs old. This drug has a little similarity which makes it easy for me to know how to use it to gain peace of mind and calmness without getting bothered my the spaced-out feeling I get from it sometimes. It's a hell of a lot better than yelling at my kids, wife, and being nervous about everything, guilt feelings, etc. I still am pulling hair out of my head, literally, and very disturbed about disappointments in my life right now, which is why I'm going to the max 200mg in about 2 weeks time. But my life is a VAST improvement with this drug. Thank G-d and my nurse practitioner!

I didn't realize I had a nervous stomach until I began taking this and my stomach felt so much better and I know how a stomach is supposed to feel!  I still have some panic thoughts, but I think I'll always be a worrier!  I have had a little dry mouth and still have a little gasiness, but overall it (along with therapy) has helped to lift me out of my depression!  I did not realize I was even feeling so badly until I started feeling better now!

I did not go to the ER this time because the reaction side effects were the same as the Celexa; I just took Benadryll, waited for them to subside, and went to bed.  My chest felt tight and my throat felt tight too, although it did not close up.  No rash or anything.  I have eczema and the ER doctors told me the first time that may have something to do with my reaction.  I have since been to 3+ psychiatrists and everyone is stumped about my reactions.

It also did not make me feel overly giddy, it makes me feel just right however it did upset my stomache in the beginning. Also, I've seen some posts about singulair which I have been on for 8 years without any anger outbursts.

The medication does not make you feel better rather it simply deprives you of emotion.  I was no longer as anxious but I hardly felt happy about anything.  My doctor moved me up to a 100mg dose after 4 months and this was terrible.  I began sweating uncontrollably, dry mouth worsened, appetite was non existent, and I had prolonged ejaculation.  The drug will ruin your libido and leave you feeling more insecure then when you started taking it.  Avoid high doses, side effects were very present.

But the weight gain is very counter-productive, the last ting you need with Depression is more negitive feelings (unwanted extra weight).

After a few months, my depression worsened.  I became aggressive in a bad way, I was angry all the time, everything bothered me.  I then became sensitive to sounds.  If a car alarm went off or a door slammed I jumped out of my skin. My feelings were easily hurt and I also felt paranoid, as if everyone was against me.  I stopped taking the mediation and  already I feel normal again. I haven't smiled for along time and forgot what having a good time was.  Even my animals noticed something was wrong with me.

I stopped Zoloft for about a year in 2003. At this point, I weaned off of 75mgs over the course of a month. I experienced all the typical withdrawal symptoms (both verified and unverified by the drug companies). These included “brain zaps”, faintness, nausea, severe rage/aggression (almost violent), crying fits, etc…  The withdrawal symptoms went away after about six months. I noticed that my compulsion to drink alcohol went away (and therefore the weight that I had gained), as did the zombie feeling. I had been on this for so long that I thought it was all normal! I actually started to feel things again, sans “Garden State”. I actually wanted to experience life. 
Unfortunately, I had to start taking it again within a year due to unexpected hardships. Within weeks of taking Zoloft again, the zombie like existence returned, as did the compulsion to drink, weight gain, etc. At this point, I realized for the first time that it was the drug that made me feel this way (crazy how it distorts your thinking). 
 I stayed on Zoloft for another six years because I was terrified of the withdrawal, and what it would do to my job and personal life if I tried to stop again.
I finally stopped taking Zoloft again about a month ago. I suppose being laid off is as good at time as any to kick a bad habit. ? I followed the same process for weaning of it. I had the exact same symptoms as the last time; “brain zaps”, faintness, nausea, severe aggression (almost violent), crying fits, etc. I’ve been off it for two months now, and I still have all the withdrawal symptoms. I don’t, however, have the “zombified” feeling, compulsion to drink alcohol, negative sexual side effects, or lack of interest in daily activities that used to accompany Zoloft for the last 15 years.

My overall mood is just better. I do have to take it in the evening with my dinner, couldn't take it in the am, just made me way too tired!!!  but nighttime does the trick. It took 3 weeks to get over some side effects, so just stick with it, it does work!!! and the side effects will go away. Just give it time and keep your starting dose as low as possible. I still have a few side effects just vivid dreams is the most dramatic.  No weight gain at all, being a nurse I do see that once patients start to feel better on any medication, the first thing people usually do is gain weight, so make sure you are not consumed by the thought of maybe gaining weight.  I am very happy I have started Zoloft and hope everyone else get the same results I have, I feel 100% better!!!!!  Great for PMS!!!!!

The only awful thing was that I could not orgasm no matter how hard we tried. That really put a strain in that department so I went off of it just for that. (I was on a 25mg dose) So now that depression has come once again, I decieded to look into natural methods. I would suggest looking up information on supplements such as SAM-e, 5-htp, and L-tyrosine.  Almost all of the reviews on line have been positive, with NO side effects. I've been taking the SAM-e and after about 8 days worked just as good as the Zoloft with NO side effects.  I just got the other two and will start slowly with them as well.  Best part is they are all nattural!! I would for sure talk to your doctor before starting them and you should always wien off slowly from zoloft and under doctor supervision.  And I only recommed this for mild cases of depreession. Im no doctor, just putting it out there for those of you who are sick of the side effects.  worth a try.

Although I did seem to feel a sense of ""longing"" or desire (not sexual) which normal folk seem to take for granted.  Before on this, one of the only things daily that offered comfort was singing.  Zoloft made me not want to sing anymore...maybe though cause I usually sing to the same album every night lol (ocd?).  This could have been somewhat of a positive though in terms of OCD, i got tired of the things i was doing on a daily routine for the past couple years which i would normally call my ""comfort zone.""

The mood swings are aboslutely horrendous when trying to get off it. I give up trying to quit and start taking my regular dose again. Absolutely no sex drive. Could care less if I ever have it again. Grinding teeth is one side effect that has cost me a lot in dental work due to cracked & chipped teeth. I've noticed the numbness in my hands but never related it to the drug.

I had the baby blues and was in and out of court with his father. Everyday i was having a panic attack and was scared and depressed. This med worked great. Today I am 25 and I am changing meds because of low sex drive. No one ever told me about this side affect. I am in the the middle of switching and it is hell. Everyday I cry, I feel shocks down my spine and to my hands. I am mad at everyone and evething i would go back to zoloft but for so long with this med i though that i had some kind of mental problem with sex and I didn't know it was the med.

They have all seemed to work for a while but eventually just stop working.  I have high hopes for this one as my psychiatrist said that she has had fairly good luck using this drug.  I'm weaning off Pristiq which has made me extremely tired which resulted in my PCP giving me Ritalin to stay awake and xanax for anxiety.  I'm tired of taking drugs to overcome the side effects of another drug.  I'll keep everyone posted as to how this works for me.. Thanks to everyone for sharing their comments.  Its important for all of us to honestly evaluate these drugs as patients and not just listen to what our doctors tell us.  Good luck to you all!!!

Be patient and let your doctor know all your side effects if any. I was told that zoloft given in higher doses seems to work better for anxiety so I am gonna trust the doctor and continue taking it.

The first few days were rough, with a dry mouth and no appetite I lost a lot of weight, and every time I closed my eyes I fell asleep. However, I am stable, and can go on with my life.

It helped me feel less depressed the first time I tried it. However, it took away all the rest of my emotions. This time it has again taken away all my emotions, but has made the depression worse. I have difficulty sleeping at night (last week I was up until 6 in the morning most nights.) My appetite has also gone down, and I often feel dizzy and lightheaded (I don't know if this is from the Zoloft directly, or decreased eating.) Also, I have lost all the motivation and inspiration that I used to have. I've found that I don't really care about anything. I'm merely walking through my life, not feeling, not seeing, or experiencing anything. Zoloft has not been a good drug for me, but I know that it does work for other people. Like anything, it's not perfect, and I've heard of just as many people who like it as people who don't like it.

- Everyone reacts differently.  Just because someone had a negative experience on this board does not mean you will.  I did not experience nausea, anxiety, sleeplessness or lethargy.  Others have.
- Start out slowly.  Your doc should put you on a lower dosage and slowly increase it over time.  This helps your body get used to it with less side effects.
- Be patient...it takes 2-3 weeks to kick in.  So you might not feel any benefit until much later on.
- It doesn't change who you are.  That was my fear.  I didn't want a happy pill.  It did lift my depression so I saw things more clearly.  I am still the same person. However, if you had life problems before this pill won't make them go away.  It will help you to deal with them for effectively by making you functional."

Happier thoughts, more outgoing and less anxiety in front of groups, more desire to be social. Some side effects are nausea even when taken with food in the morning, tiredness for about 1-2 hours after taking the medication. And the worst is weight gain even when maintaining a healthy moderate diet and exercise. I gained about 12 pounds in 6 weeks. Finally, feeling better and gradually off the drug with hopes of loosing the weight and staying healthy. I would recommend this drug in low dose for short term.

It makes me feel physically better, but it doesn't really help me get back to feeling ""happy"".  In fact I really don't feel much at all.  It has kind of just numbed all of my feelings, I guess is the best way I can put it.  I still think about everything that has made me angry and depressed quite often, and I know I should be really tore up and distressed, but I just don't feel it.  Which isn't a bad thing I suppose.  It's a much better mental state to be in than moping around and sobbing all the time.  I still don't really feel motivated to succeed or care about anything all that much, but at least now I don't feel like laying in bed and crying all day.  I am able to get up in the morning and try to put forth a LITTLE effort to acheive some form of productiveness during the day.  However, concerning my little ""not caring"" trend, my grades are in serious trouble and are declining rather swiftly.  It is very difficult to focus and pay attention to lectures some days.  Use with extreme caution if you are a student in school as this medication could pose a threat to your GPA.  The only physical side effects I have experienced so far are trouble sleeping, extreme jitteryness (esp. in the hands/legs), light dizzyness spells (standing up/driving), and weight loss.  I haven't really lost my appetite but I feel energized all the time.  I've started running and working out almost daily which would explain the slender and trim new me.  That's really what comes to mind when I think of this pill.  Weight loss lol.  Not complaining though.  The quality of life for me may not necessarily seem better while on this drug, but it has made it bearable and a little brighter.  Hope this helps."

It did in fact help with my depression and resolved the anxiety issues, BUT I could not orgasm for anything.  It was awful.  My husband would get so frustrated too and it caused major problems in our sex lives.  I started easing myself off of it, after doctor's recommendation due to my severe dissatisfaction, and am now off of it completely.  I have started taking natural (homeopathic) meds and it's amazing.  I do yoga as well and get plenty of sunshine.  The homeopathic have zero side effects and are just as effective.

At first everything was great. Life was good. However, since this was my first prescription medication I struggled remembering to take it regularly. This resulted in an emotional roller coaster each day. Then, when I would start taking it again I would have awful headaches. It just wasn't the pill for me.

Instead of feeling horrible/suicidal, you feel mostly nothing. DO NOT quit taking abruptly, nausea and malaise worse than you can believe; absolute disorientation and crazy mood swings. If you must, gradually decrease every two weeks by 25-50 mg. Oh, and don't even think about having sex, as ejaculation is nearly impossible. Cheers and good luck!

(I'm sensitive to medication and was apprehensive to start tx, but so desperate for help, I was willing to try). Soon after starting tx, I developed a constant,low-grade head ache. It differed from the usual type of headache. It was a dull, heavy- feeling of pressure in the front of my head. I actually had the feeling that the drug was working on the part of my brain not functioning properly. I took comfort in that, and actually felt that it was fixing the biochemical ""snafu"" in my head. Once the head ache was gone(usu. lasted 3-7 days.), I felt fabulous, happy, and peaceful. My initial symptoms returned in 3-4 wks,& my dose was incr'd to 50mg. This pattern repeated itself consistently over the next several mths,w/lenghtening periods of improvement w/each 25mg increase.I stabilized at 100mg/day. I was a calmer, more peaceful, happier individual--no longer suffering from extreme feelings of hopelessness and despair, distractedness,  having no patience, and being agitated at the simplest things. I once again felt happy to be alive, and grateful to be the person I hadn't been in a very,very long time. The neg.side effects I experienced were forgetfulness and wt. gain. Also, during the short-lived ""head ache"" period described above, I also got the ""yawns"" ~6 hrs. after taking medication. After being incr'd to 150mg/day a year and a half after starting tx (my symptoms had started to return, but anxiousness and edginess more so, than despair,etc.--caused by sudden job loss & life upheaval), the forgetfulness became so bad at this higher dose, that I was once driving on a familiar road close to home, and suddenly didn't recognize it, it scared me. My Dr. rx'd Wellbutrin XL 150mg to ""lift the fog"" I was experiencing which I took at the same time as zoloft,in the a.m.,and soon was no longer forgetful,but sharp-thinking/focused AND a decr'd appetite which resulted in the loss of gained wt.!!

Prior to that I had been having panic attacks which gradually turned into depression.  I can relate to previous comments regarding the first week or so of treatment.  I didn't sleep very much and became obsessed with getting enough sleep which, in turn, raised my anxiety level.  I felt like a caged animal and couldn't sit still.

It did help eliminate my panic attacks and seemed to get rid of most of my depression symtoms.  I was off of the drug for most of 2004, but started taking it again towards the end of the year.  It seemed to work, but not as well as before.  My mood was fairly good, but I became easily overwhelmed by my day-to-day responsibilities and would tend to isolate myself.  I had NO motivation or interest in my work and in my family activities.  Just recently (within the past month) I started taking Abilify to augment the Zoloft and have had a tremendous improvement in my mood and feel much more motivated."

The first week was rough due to the reactions my body gave. I got the whole inability to sleep, waking up sweating, slightly swollen gums, killed the sexual sideand interest side effects. Whatever you do, don't drink alcohol for the first 2 weeks while on it. While my body was getting use to the meds, I would wake up sweating more when I had a drink than not. 

I started with 25mg/day for the first week and then did 50mg/day for the next 4 weeks. Right now I'm up to 100mg/day. Yes it made me tired after taking it in the morning but I would wake up the next day refreshed. If I took it before I went to bed(50mg) I would wake up dead tired. Currently trying half pill(50mg) before bead and the other half of the pill when I wake up. 

The good effects about it I can tell it makes me feel a little bit happier and I don't feel as rushed to get in and out of the publics eye. I actually whant to get out some when I have the energy to (side effect is it kills your motivation a bit). 

I might try another later as I'm just getting the full effect so we'll see how it goes later. So far the effects are good I'll eventually bump up the doesage."

I had felt so bad for so long I could not believe how it felt to be happy again.  I know this is not supposed to happen...but I actually lost weight on the medicine. I suppose I no longer over ate after the depression was abated.   And my libido changed, for the better.  I know the counseling helped as well.  As a nurse, I always felt a stigma about folks who needed antidepressants but now I know better from my own personal experience.  Treat your depression, life really is worth living!

Much like Paxil, the effects wear off after a few years, but, hey-- changing every few years is no big deal!  I had virtually no side effects, that I recall.  My sex drive is only so-so, but I don't think the med is the whole reason, if its part of it at all.  I think its worth a try for most people, since I've heard of it helping others I know, too.  I see other people have had side effects, but I guess everyone is different.  This medicine didn't make me ""happy"", but it didn't leave me feeling ""flat"", like serzone. (notice the ""zone"" in serzone)  Overall, not impressive.  If you're really depressed, I'd try something stronger.  I'm supposed to try abilify with my prozac soon, and from the reviews, I'm terrified to try it!! Overall, a good enough med, not fantastic. Pretty easy to tolerate, and worth a try!"

924$Condition: Depression$1/7/2009 7:24:08 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Zoloft has been very effective for treating my depression, even compared to other SSRIs.  It took about a month to really start working once I began taking it.  The drug is a very effective libido suppressor but has not caused any other major side effects in use.  However, if you can plan ahead and skip a dose before having sex, one can overcome the libido problem without having adverse effects upon the depression.  Dose reduction and withdrawl does need to be done very slowly, over a period of several months.  When I reduced the dose too fast, I ended up with a bad depressive episode, though I knew why and was able to cope with it. Restoration to the original dose reversed the problem in a few days.  Missing more than a couple of doses in a row also caused some of the strangest dreams I've ever had.  Not bad, just really weird.  Finally, one needs to be careful taking the generic version of this drug.  The first generic version of the drug I took, which looked like the original Zoloft pill, felt like I was taking about 2/3 of my dose.  After switching to a different generic version, a larger oval shaped pill, I had no more problems.  Note that the regular Zoloft pill and both generics were labeled as 100 mg doses.

It worked pretty good but I kept raising the doses and didn't want to go too high because I knew I did not want to be dependant on this drug for a long time but it just did not take me back to feeling 100% so I was given Wellbutrin with and it made such a huge difference. I guess the two were the right mix for me and I felt pretty much back to normal and was able to get back to a normal life. I was on a good mix, and I have read where Zoloft is helping people but they still feel low, so I would suggest talking to your Dr about adding something different to whatever you are already on that is helping some, but adding something like Wellbutrin to help curb what your medication is not doing. Good Luck.

I've had a really bad year with 2 deaths in the family,divorce and careeer issues. This could be the cause of it. I've never had any bad side effects from it.. for the most part it works great. It helped me cope with a lot of stuff. The one thing I have noticed and not by my own discovery but that one of my mother is that I've had a lot of memry loss problems.

However, I was on this meidcation from may-oct 2008 and the more I took the med the worse I felt. I had panic attacks that worsened on this medication. I also had morbid or unsettling thoughts and this is not my nature.  When I started crying uncontroloably I had to be hosiptilized.  I had odd or unusualy dreams on the med (i.g. I dreamed I put salt in a washing machine).   I have been on Paxial since october 31,2008 and today is 12/22/2008.  So far I have been relieved of the panic attacks and my thoughs don't dwell on death or other things.  I also has a friend that had felt like driving over a cliff on this med.  If you have any of the unsettling thoughs please see a certified Phy. not a primary care physcian.  My PCP is great but the truth is she does not specialize in anti-depressents.  With Counseling and taking paxial and Trazidone I feel better for now.  However the debilitating effects of the Zoloft did not hit me for a few months.  God bless.  I hope Zoloft is working for you it is a wonderful drug for most people but not for me."

Zolofot has changed my life! I had been on medications given to me by my gereral practionor that made me worse ( prozac, clexea) I finally found a wonderful therapist & physiatrit who work not only with me but together to make my treatment effective. My physiatrist gave me a choice of two different meds to try I chose the zoloft. I started working within days! I still have my depressive days and moods, but they are nothing like I lived with almost my whole life. The key is finding the right medication for you!! I do dislike some of the side effects, but will take them over the depressive stat I was in. I now am able to know what it's like to be normal and enjoy things in life. I'm no longer moody, mean, rude or anxious!! Everyone has different symptoms and needs and a good doctor will be able to know what is right for you. Somtimes it take more than one drug to make it right. I also take another anti depressant at night for sleeping. With combined talk therapy and medications I have my life for the first time in almost 40 years. I'd be lost with out zoloft

My mother was diagnosed with cancer and I this triggered my doctor to prescribe the medication but I believe I have always suffered from some degree of depression and anxiety.  For the first few months it was making me quite tired but now I feel as if I have quite a bit of energy and am active for my entire day as opposed to ""taking a nap"" almost every day.  I exercise and eat right and generally keep my weight in check so I did try more natural methods before medication.  I started on 50mm was feeling better but still crying quite easily and am now taking 100mm every day and feel quite good, can handle more tasks, generally enjoy life a little more.  The side effects that I do notice are some constipation, some short term memory loss, somewhat impulsive (but maybe I needed to be a little more impulsive) and I am now beginning to notice weight gain slowly which is why I am considering weaning myself from this medication.  Someone recommended SAM-E.  Is anyone familiar with this over the counter medication?  Any other suggestions are appreciated."

How I tapered off two years ago after being on it for 10 years: I took low doses of 5-HTP during this time and was eating better. Taking the pill every other day, as is suggested, did not work. I needed to gradually shave off bits of the Zoloft each day for over two weeks (which was a comfortable rate for me.) I was taking the lower mg blue pill at the time, so it might work to start with the yellow (50mg?) shave it down to half the size then start the blue pill(25mg?). St. John's Wort was taken after I was completely off the Zoloft for a while. If I got irritable/jittery (too much seritonin?), I took L-theanine liquid drops. These can be found in natural food stores and I highly recommend seeing a naturalpath and reading books such as ""The Mood Cure"" and The Food-Mood Connection by Jack Challem. 
I have Dysthimia (mild depressive personality) and have never been hospitalized, but had I known what I know now when I was 19 and started taking them, I would have looked at diet (too much sugar!) and lack of exercise first before taking the drugs. If I had major depression, then no hesitation, I'd take them.  Anti depressants are not to be taken lightly! 
Now, after being free of the Zoloft for two years, I'm considering taking Welbutrin for a while, but this time I plan on keeping it brief and making more of an effort to eat better mood foods/exercise. I prefer to try to locate causes of depression/anxiety rather than to simply treat symptoms with pills, but maybe I need to treat the symptoms before I can start a proper routine. 
There must be a delicate balance between neurotransmitters and hormones and gut flora. There must be a subtle forces at work that have foods and exercise so greatly influence moods and energy. I want to listen to the body and mind enough to find the right balance. Medication is for now a stop-gap; a floor to stand on and not a crutch. This time I intend to be mindful and not ""pop pills!""  "

Now when I first started it I had to call in to work because my eyes dilated and it made it hard to read; I think that wore off in a few days. I think it may have been the 2nd month (could have been during the 1st) I suddenly gained 20lbs; and I worked a physical job. I do believe it was during this time the medicine started to have no effect. I stayed with it because I wanted to be better and I thought it would help. I finally gave up on it after about a year and just stopped taking it (I know, bad). I noticed after being on Zoloft that I get more angry (and easier) and can't control my emotions like I once could; I'm more emotional. Obviously everyone is different so my experience may be completely different than yours. All I know is now I wish I had never taken that medicine, I am more depressed than ever, slight paranoia has been added to the mix, I still can't control my emotions as easily and can cry or get pissed at the dumbest little things that didn't used to bother me before Zoloft. For those that it works, I am happy it do so for you. It's not easy to find something that works and works well.

I have always been depressed since my mother died of cancer when I was 11.  I was also on it to treat heavy mood swings towards anger/rage that would be over absolutely nothing.  I was on 50mg/day.  I didn't notice a huge change in my mood myself but others around me did.  My depression was slightly better but I would often still be in a less than great mood.  It helped my anger and mood swings noticably.  I would still get angry over things but I wouldn't go into a rage.  The only side effect I noticed was severe drowsiness.  I would drink anything with caffeine in it and still be yawning a lot.  When I thought I was better I had to VERY SLOWLY get off of it.  When I tried cold turkey, I felt like passing out and extreme dizziness constantly.  I should not have quit taking it.  I am currently trying Prozac to avoid the drowsiness.

Before I started Lustral(Zoloft), I still had violent outbursts related to my ADHD, but they became an awful lot more frequent. I stayed on them for two years before deciding to ween myself off them at my own accord. My OCD had greatly improved. When I was 18, I went back to the doctor due to feeling extremely depressed. He put me back on Lustral as it was one that had worked for me in the past. Within two weeks, I was manic/happy but was acting severely out of character, I did a lot of things I reget within that time. After weening myself off them, I was still getting horrific violent thoughts and extreme paranoia. I came out of remission pretty quick and ended up being prescribed Cipramil (Celexa) and it has helped to calm me down a great deal. People say I'm a joy to be with now.

There is no magic pill to immediately cure all ills and I realize that I will always suffer from some level of depression, as I have for my entire life. However, I am no longer suicidal and I am content. That is more than enough for me after the hell my life has been previously. I can work, I can eat, and I can sleep (mostly).

This drug slightly helped with panic attacks and anxiety, but only somewhat. Depression did not go away at all. The more I increased the doseage with doctor's suggestion, the more 'irritated' I felt during the day about everthing and everyone. My family really noticed a huge difference in my mood swings with this drug, and after giving this drug several months trial, I discontinued its use. The drug I now take that is effective for me in every area is Effexor. Every patient is different and also reacts differently to medications. If Zoloft, or any other anti-depressent, isn't working for you, don't be afraid to tell your doctor and find something that does.

A anti-anxiety is also required to deal with the stress as the two go hand in hand!

I suddenly didn't care about anything: self, family, etc. There was no enjoyment in life anylonger. I have taken Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Paxil and Cymbalta with no apparent relief. Changed doctors. Now Zoloft in the AM and Xanax as needed, up to 3 a day. Major positive changes occuring. I'm still exactly like I was, but I get out of the house now, have started old hobbies, and best of all, I've become a part of my family again. I'm sold at this point.

Took it the third day, all symptoms mentioned above got worse and I also had heart palpitations.

However, my sister in law who has serious panic attacks was prescribed it while pregnant, they had her on 100mg per day, there were no issues that I know of, and my nephew is now 9 years old.  Definately a life saver for me, many times, and not addictive, which was a major concern for me when my doctor first prescribed it.

Right now, I don't have any of the side effects, even the sexual side effects.

The biggest drawback I see so far is not being able to take ibuprofen.  Ibuprofen is the only OTC pain reliever that works for me.

Social anxiety is much less; I used to break out in hives, I'd get so nervous! I also have obsessive-compulsive disorder, where,under great stress, I would rub and pull all my eyelashes out. I still struggle with that one, but zoloft has helped me to control it so that I now HAVE eyelashes!I've never tried anything but zoloft, so not sure if anything would work better.

I am currently taking 100mg every morning.  My husband and those around me say they notice a big difference.  I just notice my husband and I dont fight anymore (at least not serious fights).  I also have OCD tendancies and anxiety attacks, this helps but I still have an attack once in awhile, I take Xanex for that.  I dont feel any different on or off the meds but I suppose thats a good thing.  My therapist has said I am co-dependant on my mother (who is depressed and addicted to drugs) and zoloft has really really helped with that.  I am not longer her ""btch"" and we dont fight nearly as much.  I dont feel responsible for her any longer.  Honestly if it werent for Zoloft I truly believe my husband would have left me by now and I would be living with my mother waiting on her hand a foot.  
I cant physically tell a difference with Zoloft but when I step back and look at my reactions and how I process things, I am a much happier person and I have more patience.  I am not exausting myself tring to make everyone else happy and not feeling so guilty for making me happy.  Who would have thought, ""making yourself happy"".  How can you please others when youre miserable?  YOU CANT!  I tried for 29 years.  Zoloft has given me my life back and now my relationship with everyone in my family is better.  I have found new frineds though, apparently they liked the old me, they say I have changed. "

My doctor prescribed it to me for depression, 100 mg a day. After my first dose, I had fatigue and felt completely drained of energy. I had errands to run that day, and this medication made it almost impossible because I barely had the willpower to get up. Over the next few days, the symptoms continued, and I felt like a walking corpse. I didn't get excited, angry, happy, sad...I just generally felt nothing at all and had no desire to do anything but sit at home staring at the TV like a zombie. I also had a decreased appetite and only ate because I knew I had to. To top it off, my sex drive was non-existent. I couldn't get an erection at all, not that I was in the mood to have sex anyways because I didn't feel like doing anything at all. My doctor told me that all these symptoms were normal and that they would go away the more I used it. But after day 3, I finally couldn't take it anymore and stopped using it. I felt better the way I did before I started taking it. This medication basically made me feel 10 times worse, and putting up with it any longer with the hope these side effects would go away was just not worth it for me. I guess it might help some people, but this was just simply a nightmare medication for me. I am now on 0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed, and am finally experiencing the quality of life I have been searching for.

Its been 28 months later and I do feel better. My husband and I have both been taking it and now I'm seeing some differences.

Frequent headaches and stomach pain if one to two doses are missed.
I also suffer from Endometriosis and am taking the depo provera shot and have been for about 3 years. Im just trying to find out if there are more people out there that are going through what I am.

When my husband died in a car accident during my 8th month, we increased my dosage.  My baby was, and still is, very normal (many people say she's highly intelligent).  I was very nervous about it affecting her, but now I see that the doctors were right about it being safe during pregnancy.  Whew!  

This medication has helped me for over a year and I think it saved my sanity during very difficult times.  I have recommended it to others and now my cousin even takes it and says his confidence has remarkably improved!  He has started dance classes, which is completely out of character (he's very shy).

The PROS:  greatly reduced anxiety (without the 'high' feeling that Xanax gives), lots of calmness/evenesss, and a big help with crying/sadness!  When I tried to get off of the medication, I had a hard time even getting out of bed each day, so I went back on it.  

The MAYBES:  I don't seem to notice much affect on my OCD and I still haven't lost much weight from my pregnancy.  I don't necessarily eat more or less, but I'm bigger than I used to be.  Not sure if that's the medication or not.

The CONS:  still have mildly reduced motivation, decreased sex drive, and I've become more 'dingy' and forgetful.  If you can deal with that, the benefits are great!  "

So bad and within the same frame everyday , that I THOUGHT I was pregnant. This is DEFINITELY not the case. Another symptom I am having is gas.  I constantly feel like I have to burp.  Coworkers laugh because I walk around patting myself on the back. I also have found I am contantly bouncing my leg.  I can't be still, even when standing. Yet I don't ""feel"" anxious. Weird!  Sex drive is in toilet! Not that it was ever that great! LOL. Just hate it for my hubby because it is WAY worse now!

I couldn't sleep and had itch attacks in the middle of the night.

After 2 weeks, my overactive system calmed down, I didn't crave sweets, and began to sleep again, I actually lost 15 lbs, I began working out and had my sunny disposition back! I really hesitated using drugs, but nothing else was working, and I was spending over $500 month on creams, ointments, herbs, co-pays, lab tests, etc. which made me itch even more-I didn't want to be labeled - but it is working and I am no longer in a fog."

1072$Condition: Depression$5/12/2008 8:35:17 PM$Reviewer: $5$4$5$"I have been taking Vitamin Z for a year and a half, and it's been a real life saver.  For 10 years i tried to treat my depression in natural ways (working out, St. Johns, acupuncture, praying, being healthy, etc!), with the haze sometimes lifting for a bit but mostly not.  Zoloft finally gave me my life back and my only regret is that I hadn't taken it MUCH sooner.  The first week was rough--I was tired and dizzy, but then i got some acupucture to help me out of that fog and that got me going again.  Every day was a new adventure in not being depressed.  Wow--I sing to my dog in the morning!  Wow--I don't hate my body!  Wow--I'm not a huge, giant, pathetic loser!  

This drug doesn't work for everyone--my depression manifested as extreme sorrow, loneliness, alination and despair.  I was never manic, never angry--just woefully sad, no  matter how hard I tried to be positive, appreciate what I have, etc. etc.  

I do have delayed orgasm, but not having such huge despair in life more than offsets that.  I do not have a lowered libido.

I have gained 20 lbs. in 1 year on this drug, which is a problem.  It's not taht I was hungry all the time--just that I somehow lost my good discipline around food.  I can't totally blame the drug--I've also been a snacky piggy at work.  I blame 10 lbs. on myself and 10 lbs. on the drug.  

This drug also does not help w/ my physical pain symptoms (intense muscle pain) we believe is from the depression.  I have tried Cymbalta for that but it constipated me horribly.  So I am back to square one and am looking to try a new drug to help w/ the pain--also one that does not cause weight gain!  BTW I work out all the time and am very healthy, and I still gained weight.  Also, I didn't have any major withdrawal from Zoloft/Cymbalta--but I also flood my body w/ vitamins and antioxidants (and acupuncture, exercise and fruits and veggies), and I believe this helps ease withdrawal symptoms in general.   

Good luck finding the right drug!"

It has made a huge difference in my life!  Before starting, I was depressed and teary for no apparent reason.  Since taking the medication, the ONLY problem I have had is when I don't refill it in a timely manner.  When that happens, I get a ringing in my ears and feel ""funny"".  Once I start back on the pills, I am immediately better.  My doctor has told me that if I ever decide to go off the medication, I will have to do it very slowly....weaning my body off of  it.  I am not there yet, but I plan to stay on it until I go through menopause and then see what happens.  One point to note is that I am at the lowest dosage and have been there for over 10 years.....It has been a life saver for me!!"

For 2 years I have tried to cope with the reality that he was more interested in going to talk to her and would just be silent or have little conversation with me.  He drank alot and became a chain smoker the last two years.  In January this year, I confronted him again about his behavior and he left for the night.  He came back the next day talking about divorce.  I could not believe that my questions about another woman could provoke that action.  I went to my gynocologist for help and he prescribed Zoloft and advised my meeting with a counselor.  I will have to say that the combination of these two helped me keep sane mind.  I will continue taking Zoloft as long as my doctor advises and hopefully it will help my anxiety during my marital problems.  It surely did take the edge off when I could not focus or lost alot of sleep.

Over the next two months I gained 40 pounds. While depression improved somewhat, I think it was due more to getting sleep thanks to Xanax and Ambien rather than from Zoloft. When I stopped taking it I plunged into a deeper depression than before within 48 hours and had suicidal thoughts. Took 3 months of very slow weaning to get myself off Zoloft, and 4 years to lose all the weight. I took it less than a year and my depression finally lifted due to life changes rather than this drug. Will not take again.

After awhile, it stopped being quite as effective & my dosage was increased. That's when the trouble started.  I developed a tremor in my hands so bad that my finger was constantly tapping the mouse when I was using the computer.  This I could live with, but I developed the most bizarre behavior when I went to bed.  As my muscles were beginning to relax, I would have around 30 minutes of what seemed like grand mal seizures...except that I was awake and conscious.  All limbs and neck would jerk violently...and I couldn't control it.  I just learned to lay there and take it with humor...sorta like some sort of bizarre amustment park ride for 30 minutes.  Weird.  Also restless leg syndrome got extremely bad....I'd try to not move when the urge hit, and after a few seconds, my leg would jerk violently...like nerve synapses were shooting out electrical signals and my muscles HAD to respond to them.  My Dr switched me to Lexapro, and the tremor is gone as are the seizure-like jerking.  I still have restless leg syndrome, but it has greatly diminished in severity.  Lexapro seems to work as well as the Zoloft on depression symptoms, as well.

I sometimes still would experience a day or so of depression but with a dose of Xanax, it'd go away.
About three weeks ago, I felt one of those days coming on so to head it off, took a Xanax. Here I am 3 weeks later and it's still here. I called my doctor a couple of days ago and told him my symptoms had returned...with a vengeance. I could not shake this ""thing"" - I'm irritable, angry at the slightest thing, concentration is nearly zilch...the usual litany. But I also have a series of aches & pains I didn't have before and I'm literally worn out all the time. 
(I took the WebMD depression test and it labeled me as severly depressed. I reckon I didn't know there were different levels of this monster. Now I do.)
Doctor doubled my dose and said it'll take about a week for me to adjust. I'm anxious to see. 
Knowing I could feel so good for the time I did and then slipping into this fugue again is even more depressing.
I pray the increased dosage helps. I'm at my wits end. "

My sypmtoms included having trouble remembering details/thoughts, headaches, tiredness, anxiety about what people thought of me, and trouble putting myself in large group settings (I'm a very outgoing person).  I was also in a very difficult marriage and was contemplating leaving.  The first two weeks of Zoloft were awful.  I had horrible headaches, pain all over my brain.  I was tired but could not sleep.  I took the pill with milk, but I was hungry and could not eat. I also experienced increased brain activity, where it was almost as though I could feel ""energy"" in my head...hard to describe.  Additionally I remember a few nights where the sleeplessness caused me to feel suicidal, I had almost evil thoughts, ""maybe I would be better off dead"", ""why am I here""...  I took off work for these two weeks (highly recommended) and luckily I was blessed with a mentor who had been through anti-deppressants and he constantly brought me back to reality.  Once I went to my prescribed dose (50mg--I had been taking half-pills for a few days) the symptoms got much less drastic, but I still struggled with sleeping.  I found a small fountain of water next to my bed helped.  It is now a year and half later and I am doing amazing, I feel like I have my life back!  I cannot imagine going off of this medication as I am much more present in my life.  I have noticed some possible sexual side effects, as it is harder for me to experience orgasm.  I worry about pregnancy and breastfeeding and having to make those decisions, but I am very happy on Zoloft.  I will say if you are not happy or if your side effects persist, try something else!  This is such a hit/miss drug as I know those who are successful with it and some that hate it.  Also, be careful with missing doses, sometimes if it is the middle of the day, I will only take a half pill, but you will have headaches, resting helps this."

I have found it to be very successful in treatment of mood swings.  Side effects for me have included malaise and weight gain.  If I miss a dose a get headaches.  Despite the side effects I believe zoloft has helped me greatly.  I will need to take it forever probably, but it does keep me more even tempered and I feel like i can cope with my life now.  I guess it is a trade off.

Last year I started having a lot of anxiety for no reason and my doctor increased my dosage to 100.  That took care of the problem.

1135$Condition: Depression$2/12/2008 8:41:07 PM$Reviewer: ejordan , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I'vew been on this medication for approx 2.5 years.  It has really calmed me down.  I no longer fight the anxiety feelings that used to keep me feeling like I was in a cage or wanting to jump off of the roof, or drive my car off of a bridge.  My only concern/big concern is that I have no desire for sexual intercourse and that have left me feeling numb.  However, I rather trade the anxiousness, racing heart, suicidal thoughts, racing mind and lack of concentratin in for some degree of normalcy that Zoloft affords me.  My husband doesn't seem to mind, or he hasn't expressed a concern.  He's 7 years my senior and in his mid 50s.  I'll continue to try and work on the lack of continuous sexal drive issue because, everyone once in a while I crave sex.  To help me out in the sexual area I've purchased an electronic friends (Super Mario) and he helps me out in that area.  In the meantime everyonce in a while I do  crave intimacy (Super Mario)isn't able to afford me.  For now, I'm ok with the sanity I've been given, and the calm state of being.  Thank God for Zoloft, and the calmness it brings me.  I'm even started back doing crossword puzzles.  Something, I haven't done for years, and I'm also doing suduko.  My what a relief - Thank you Zoloft.

I have been on so many antidepressants that I can't even remember them all.  None of them worked for me and I stopped taking any at all for several years because I felt like a zombie.  After much research and a serious bout of depression last year, I asked my Dr to prescribe Zoloft.  I started on a very small dose in April and slowly worked up to 150mg. Things that used to bother me and make my life hard, don't bother me anymore.  I have been on Zoloft for 10 months now and am also in therapy. My friends and family all can see how I have changed into a calmer person who does not ""flip out"" or sweat the small stuff anymore.  I am a happier person and able to handle so much more than I could before.  I do believe, however, that any antidepressant is a tool to enable you to be able to work on yourself and how you think and react to things by using therapy in conjunction with antidepressants.  This is the first time in my life that I have done this and when I look back to how I was a year ago, the change is amazing."

I was on a relatively low dose, but it worked very well. The only real problem that I had with this treatment was the effect it had on my libido. I had almost no sexual desire while on this drug. While this was frustrating the improvement in my mood and motivation made it a fair trade. The other thing that I noticed (after I was off) was how much it was also moderating my good moods. I felt good, not depressed, but at the same time my normally happy/hyperactive personality was toned way down. I didn't realize how much I missed it until I came off the medication and started feeling really happy and fun again.

I guess when I started taking Paxil my chemistry was such that I was running on nervous energy. The Doc told me that Paxil is more sedative than Zoloft so I tried it. So far, I have more energy and feel mentally more alert. I hope to increase to 100mg after a couple weeks. I was taking 20mg 2/day of Paxil and am currently on the first week of Zoloft taking 50mg.

I went through four weeks of hell. I had back flashes of everything bad that went on in my life.At four week the doctor raised it to 100mg. I started feeling somewhat normal. Then two weeks later the med was increased to 150mg. after the second day I went back to 100mg because I felt bad again. Back flashes severe anxiety, edgy, jumping to conclusions, thinking people were trying to hurt me. I have yet after four days of going back to 100 mg changed I will stay at this amount until I hear from the doctor. And mind you I have called four times this week and no one has gotten back to me. I can't sleep at night, my legs are worse (restless leg syndrome) and the only thing that helps is Klonopin which doc wants me off of. I have been prescribed Ambien for sleep and Nuerontin for the pain. which do not work as well as Lortab and Klonopin. I really don't know who to turn to anymore to get my life back in order..being functional in everyday life, like cleaning my surroundings and me as well as going to work. I just can't work. When I get up to get dressed I go into a panic and just liked before any anti-depressant feel tired and go back to sleep. if anyone can help either find a doctor or guide me better on this med I would appreciate it.Does this site have an email address place for people to respond?

I've been on Zoloft for 2 months and i did notice some restless nights at first but have no trouble now. 
I am on a low dose but after a couple weeks i did notice that things were not as upsetting to me and seemed happier. 
Three weeks ago my father died suddenly and if not for the medications i was already on i think my depression would have had a devastating effect on me. 
I did notice that if i didnt take my zoloft for 3 days i had a sudden change in mood. I thought that by being more stable in my life i wouldnt need the Zoloft but i couldnt explain the sudden mood change to depressing thoughts. I immediately took the Zoloft that night and have felt ok since. 

As for the loss of sex drive, i think i have noticed a change but i have a wonderful relationship now and we still have regular sex although i do notice it is difficult for me to achieve an orgasm. 

At first i was afraid to take Zoloft from all the reviews i read but now i am grateful for it. It has definitely helped me thru a very rough time in my life.

Overall, zoloft has helped me MUCH more with anxiety than depression, but it definitely helped in both areas. 

Another good thing is that zoloft doesn't completely kill my personality like welbutrin and prosac did.

1238$Condition: Depression$10/29/2007 5:32:00 PM$Reviewer: Cassidy , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I know many people have to try several different anti-depressants before one worked for them. I was lucky because Zoloft was the first medication prescribed to me after my first severe depressive episode and in less than two weeks I was thinking clearer and more rational than I ever had. Actually, I like to say I felt like the person I really am and not the person who couldn't control their negative, self deprecating thoughts. Because I have a family history of depression and chemical imbalance I've stayed on Zoloft indefinitely (10 years now). When I've tried to go off, within weeks I can feel the depressive thoughts sneaking back. One thing I would say to someone who needs an antidepressant - it does not work overnight, but takes time to build up in your body to do what it is intended to do to make you feel better.

1252$Condition: Depression$10/26/2007 1:01:53 PM$Reviewer: $4$4$5$"After reading previous reviews, I certainly can see we all have different metabolisms--thats why it's important to have a trustworthy and competent dr. overseeing ones treatment. A chemical imbalance is ultimately responsible for a lot of our symptoms. Apprehension about seeking help is our 1st hurdle. We shouldn't let a bad experience with any (1) drug or type of drug deter us from finding relief.  I myself, need to change my medication usually annually. (apparently I build up a tolerance). As I sense it happening, I freely and openly discuss with my personal physician and we either have tried a different med. or upped dosage at times. Over the last 8yrs. we have found that going back and forth between Paxil and Zoloft works best for my metabolism. Prozac and Climadyn weren't well tolerated (got worse).  
So, in conclusion, I like to say don't give up--you don't have to live life being depressed, anxious etc.. but it may take a few tries to find what chemical may be active, inactive, overactive in your system. 
KISS - KEEP IT(life) SIMPLE SWEETY!   p.s. someday our dna will enable us to quickly and absolutely know what our bodies are in need of, in excess of, etc.. until then its trial and error, and my dr. I've chosen to trust.  My own knowledge isn't always enough.  Again seek help if you are having depression, anxiety or other problems -- the answer could be 1 appt. away. "

1268$Condition: Depression$10/10/2007 12:18:20 PM$Reviewer: Dave, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$  This drug has been very effective. The results came quickly. There were some side effects. The side affects were diarrea, vision concentration problems and sexual disfunction. With the doctors permision I divided the pill up and took smaller amounts more often. This worked equally as well while eliminating 80% of the side affects. I will continue useing this product!

I find that bowel movements are small, but frequent thoughout the day.  This is much better than the chronic constipation I experienced while using other drugs in this class.  It has been very effective in treating my long-term depression.
