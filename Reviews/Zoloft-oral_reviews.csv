On the flip-side, I now have severe diarrhea since going from 25mg to 50mg, so I will either have to go back on 25mg or find another med.

After a week of taking it, I lost my appetite and had even more trouble sleeping than Usual. after a couple weeks, I couldnâ??t sleep at all (note I was taking 300 miligrams of trazadone at night and I was not sleeping one bit for 2 days straight) and I literally could not eat, and I could barely drink. After 4-5 weeks, I was about ready to attempt suicide , so I consulted my doctor and stopped taking it all together. I would not recommend this drug to people, especially people under the age of 21. Everyone I know whoâ??s taken it has also had awful experiences with it, so itâ??s not just me.

I was 40 years old, wound up with a c-section and an incision that wouldn't heal, and I couldn't breastfeed - no milk supply. I began Zoloft and titrated up to 100 mg daily. It took about 4-6 weeks for the side effects to dissipate. Totally changed my life. Eleven years later I do experience some emotional ""numbing"", but I'll take that over the very low lows I experienced with PPD. Additionally, I think I have always been low-key depressed even in my 20s. It def runs in my family. I occasionally think about titrating down and eventually going off the meds, but I haven't been given a good enough reason. lol."

I was on Zoloft for almost 3years and had tapered off with my psychiatrist permission. I did well for 3 months and back in December 2018 I had a panic attack and from then I’ve been fighting my anxiety/depression. So recently my psychiatrist upped my dose for 50mg to 75mg and I’ve been feeling much better about the depression but I still wake up with anxiety so I take .25mg Xanax in the morning which helps a lot but then it seems to wear off quickly. I didn’t want to take Xanax I just wish my Zoloft would work with my anxiety already. I have these throbbing pains in my head, anxiety every morning, I feel like I’m not myself, I feel weird looking at myself in the mirror, I have memory loss too. Does anyone else feel like that? Could it be I have a wrong diagnosis? "

I had never had this drug previously. After my very first dose, 2 hours later a woke from a nap and shortly after had an intense panic attack. I DO NOT have a history of panic attacks, but I've experienced the very initial onset of them so I was aware of this building feeling. Usually this onset feeling has not lasted more than 30 secs, but this time it came on within 30 secs into a full blown panic attack. Had I not recognized what is was I would have called EMT. Attack lasted 30 mins. I had 2 more of these attacks before bedtime and never came down from the last one. I was awake all night feeling like I was constantly on the edge of having a panic attack.

I took 25mg for 6 weeks. The first two weeks I was very optimistic & feeling slight improvement in my mood (maybe placebo?)

However, I spent the next 4 weeks extremely constipated DESPITE eating tons of hydrating fruits, prunes, & lots of water daily. 
It's hard to tell if the irritability I experienced was because of the medication itself or a result of the constipation, but ultimately I decided that it wasn't worth it, and quit cold turkey with zero ill effects. I felt back to my normal self the next day. 

The experience taught me that I could feel worse, so needless to say I'm counting my blessings without it ?? 

One thing I did like about it, was that it suppressed my appetite & I lost 10lbs in those 6 weeks (I feared gaining weight on it based on other reviews)

I was still experiencing racing thoughts, and anxiety.  Nervousness, butterflies in my stomach.  It did make me happier in a sense and helped my social anxiety, however it made me extremely tired mid-day every day.

It also made me VERY nauseous to the point that I felt like I had the urge to throw up inside of my throat.

18$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/21/2019 4:35:17 AM$Reviewer: E, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$2$1$Started 25mg because of a breakup and job loss. I didnt think I needed an antidepressant like Zoloft, but the Dr. recommended it. First week was hell; insomnia, diareah,no appetite and still anxious. 2nd week getting better with the shits and appetite coming back. If you drink alcohol while on it, prepare for a horrible next day as far as being depressed. Everyone is different and Im not sure I need this, so I drank a few nights while on it, and it didnt kill me. Most days it makes me not sleep, so I drink a sleepytime tea. Im only 2 weeks in on this Zoloft, and I also have .5 lorazepam I can take also. That puts me out within 1 hr. Most people on this thread seem like they benefit from this because they have a lifelong struggle with depression, which is great if it works. Maybe I will see a change in another 2 weeks, but I think these first 2 weeks is too soon to judge it. I would say give it the 4-6 week range Dr's tell you and maybe you'll feel better. As far as alcohol...stay the hell away from it unless you wanna feel like complete ass the next day, feel more depressed than when you started this med and possibly do horrible damage to your liver.

This brought a lot onto my shoulders but Zoloft definately helped. The drug will not do all the work for you. You also have to be willing to better yourself aswell.

20$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$2/15/2019 9:52:54 PM$Reviewer: Shan, 13-18 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$2$4$I switched over from Lexapro to Zoloft and it was a horrible decision. My psychiatrist made the switch rather quickly which may have lead to the seriousness of my side effects. For the past 2 weeks I have had 2-3 nosebleeds a day. After consulting with my psychiatrist I learned it was a listed side effect. These nosebleeds arenâ??t dripping blood itâ??s gushing and they leave me fatigued and Iâ??ve had increased difficulty walking around and such due to blood loss. However the biggest issue for me has been the acne. I have never had a problem with acne before but almost immediately I began to develop painful cysts all along my jawline and cheeks and even my forehead. This is also a side effect and in talking to others I have heard this isnâ??t uncommon. I intend to switch back to lexapro because the side effects of this have been far too much.

22$Condition: Panic Disorder$12/2/2018 8:23:01 PM$Reviewer: jadedaries, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month$5$5$5$I was diagnosed with PTSD, OCD with intrusive thoughts and Panic Disorder, due to a very traumatic, stressful past. I was placed on Zoloft 50 mg and I started therapy right away. I was on it a few years the first time. For me, Zoloft took away the panic, the intrusive thoughts, the anxiety and depression. It has allowed me to work through personal issues in therapy and not be overwhelmed by them. I also incorporated clean nutrition and exercise, especially running. I found that in combination with Zoloft, this had a major impact on reducing my stress levels and has kept anxiety, panic, intrusive thoughts and depression away! Due to this, I was taken off of Zoloft for a couple of years and was doing great with just my nutrition and running routine. However, recently had to go back on it due to major stress from caring for two family members for 9 years until their passing. I was under major stress which opened the door for panic, intrusive thoughts, depression etc., to rear it's ugly head to the point to where I thought I was having a heart attack. Talk about scary! In Dec. 2018, I was put back Zoloft, 75 mg, which has cleared my mind of all the depression, panic and intrusive thoughts once again. It took about a week this time. I am back in therapy to undo all the stress, back to running and clean nutrition. My trigger is STRESS! Zoloft gives me back my life and stops all the mental nonsense so I can work through and resolve my issues.

It worked great in the since that I was made emotionally flat. Unlike other SSRI medications I was stable on it though. 

I went from a severe fluctuation between manic and depressive moods to being calm. Eventually I had no motivation to improve myself and was slowly wasting away. I would have been okay with every ending or just continuing as it was with no preference. 

After getting off the drug my mood cycles are now very numbed and no longer effect my daily life. While weaning off the drug I was thrown back into a manic depressive hyperactive state. I got back on it and weaned off again 6 months later with success. Ever since I have had a low libido and tend to not want to do anything social. I still have mild bipolar like symptoms but I am working on improving myself now and have seen slow improvements since I got off the medication 3 years ago. I believe one day I will be normal again if I ever was to begin with."

This was when I was over stressed and got easily angered, may yell at people, was impatient.  That is gone with Zoloft.  However Zoloft had absolutely no effect on either the frequency or severity of my panic attacks.  I needed Valium to do that......or sadly ethyl alcohol, which was my only resort when a doctor refused prescribing Valium for me.  I previously took Valium only when needed and as a result had no possibility of getting addicted.  The SSRI's (Zoloft, Lexapro, etc) also completely destroyed my sex life.

I could feel the balance within a week to two weeks. 
 My only concern was some of the side effects... severe dry mouth and night sweats.  The night sweat was really bad to the point I recently stopped taking it.  It only got worsen over time.

The constant dry mouth and eyes, sometiming muscle twitch, sharp head pains periodically, the low sex drive (if you have a partner) and did I mention the dry mouth!! The diarrhea keeps the weight down with the suppress appetite lol. Overall, it's better then Prozac and Nortriptyline in my opinion and highly recommended.

I feel like I'm operating at about 90% of my ""old"" self.  I didn't know if I'd ever feel this good again and I think Zoloft helped immensely with overcoming major depression and anxiety.  My symptoms developed about 4-5 years ago and I had tried everything:  therapy, supplements, dietary/lifestyle changes, not to mention about 10 different antidepressants (Paxil, Prozac, Lexapro, Effexor, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Fetzima).  I was afraid I was bipolar, or simply couldn't tolerate antidepressants, or that I was just screwed.  Zoloft has been a miracle for me.  I have slight nausea and that is it.  I take it in the morning.  Only 12.5mg and somehow that seems to be enough.  I'm shocked.  Don't give up!!  Keep trying until one works - there are a lot of them out there.  "

I wish I got help sooner. Zoloft 200 mg helps me along with xanax at 4 mg a day and therapy. Been on for 3 plus years due to severe symptoms of anxiety, ptsd, sadness due to abuse. Each med works different for people,I tried to stop it and the nightmares began immediately again, trial and error. I did gain a lot of weight but it could be stress and my age, thyroid issues. I have stopped blaming the medicine and changed my diet and walking and it's working. Love the zoloft but wish I didn't need it.

The side effects dissipated after a week.  The only thing that made me decide I really needed to look for a different drug was the fact that this made me fall asleep very early in the evening. Like 6 pm.  I have a lot of stuff to do after work and this made it nearly impossible to do anything, but work and sleep.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes open when driving at times.

I started having severe anxiety within 7 days, by 14 days I was unable to sleep.  I was completely unaware of what was real and what was not, unable to drive or function at all.  It was better to deal with my depression that to take this medication as it landed me in a psychiatric hospital for a month in order to on other medications to get me back to ""normal"".  Overall it took more than 2 years to get back to ""normal"" after taking this medication.  It has now been 8 years since starting this medication, and still the thought of it gives me severe anxiety and PTSD from the whole experience.

I suffer from anxiety and some depression.  I am taking 50 mg once a day.  I am always tired, and it's a fight to keep my eyes open during the day at work.  My attitude is calmer,which is nice, but sometimes I catch myself staring out into outer space (if you get my drift), maybe it's because of being so tired.  I also am experiencing dry mouth.  I notice I perk up close to the time I have to take my next pill.  Not sure if this is how I want to feel, tired all the time.  Unmotivated really, I went from doing everything to do nothing or not wanting to do much.  LOL, can't win.  Anyways, I try it out for the full month and make up my mind at the end of 4-5 fews if I want to pursue.

I'll be starting Risperidone and coming off this one.

I've had no side effects as well as no positive effects what so ever, it's a very weak medication, basically like drinking water. I guess if your symptoms aren't bad at all and you want an easy way out of your problems, then this could be the drug for you.

These are the symptoms I experience and trying to medicate: Hypervigilence, jumpiness, sensitivity to sudden noises (like a door slamming shut), only experience emotional ''numbness'' or anger/rage, cloudy mind, disconnection/dissociation/depersonalization, etc. PTSD"

Started and stopped several times thinking oh I will be fine without it. But no! 2 days after missing my dosage of 200mg I cant even carry on a normal conversation without being irritated . I broke down crying over things I used to be able to just let it fly buy , and to watch the news even brought me to more tears. I wasn't interested in anything , no housework done, errands, regular outings nothing! I went back on my 200mg dosage and after 2 days I was back to myself again....But don't forget about the major withdrawal symptoms I experienced during the time I thought I don't need to take my meds. Dizziness, unable to eat, my stomach hurt if I ate or didn't . Then I couldn't keep nothing down. I was so tired stayed in bed for days. I have now realized I can't live a happy life without it. But it took me at least 10 years fighting back to accept the facts. So listen to me, give it time to work, It wont work instantly. When I stared I was at 25mg...Now at 200mg....Life is good today and my future is prosperous. 
74$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/16/2016 10:06:38 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My life has changed with zoloft. After years of suffering from general anxiety disorder; I have found peace. No more 800 hamsters running in my head. Millions of ideas swirling in my mind even when I slept. At 50 for the first time in my life, no more mood swings either. I was living a difficult situation that only made my emotional state worse till I had full blown panic attacks again...which I hadn't had in 20 years. Due to my state I was put on the maximum dosage of 200 mg, starting at 100 mg and making my way up. My revision comes up in April of 2017. The dosage will be lowered. I am willing to do cognitive therapy.  However, my doctor agrees that at my age changing the way I think is a difficult task. So I will be on zoloft for the rest of my life and I am fine with that because now I have more of a normal life. I wish I had been diagnosed in my 20's....would have made my life so much simpler...but I count myself lucky to have it now. If this medication doesn't work for you, keep trying there is one out there that will....and gives you a better and brighter life.

It also caused some slight tremors and made my blood sugar drop dramatically. I also began to to develop ulcer-like sores on my tongue and gums.

I had problems way before going but it seems things got worse when I returned. I couldn't even get my haircut without getting a panic attack and just having to sit there with crazy thoughts in my head while trying to maintain small talk.  I started avoiding situations all together, sitting in a classroom seemed unbearable.  I would experience a panic attack probably once a week which would trigger a deep depression.  I thought once I had experienced that first panic attack that I was broken inside and ruined for life to forever have panic attacks.  I went to the doctor, explained what was happening and got lucky enough to find this one first which works for me.  I have been on it for 4 years at 100mg.  I only experience slight anxiety which is exactly what I want as I can use that anxiety effectively in a situation, and the depression is only normal sadness I'd say, nothing like the things I experienced before. I hope you find what works for you. Don't give up after just trying it for a week or two, it takes a while and it may get worse before it gets better.  Also, I did know a close family member that tried taking an SSRI and it caused acute psychosis with a complete detachment from reality.  It turned out they were bipolar and SSRIs were not compatible, lesson in point have someone close to you monitor you and make sure you're not going cookoo, you crazy SOB

But also felt the same on 50mg. I have noticed and improvement in my depression and anxiety. I just hoping with time the sleepiness goes away. Ive lost all desire to exercise or have any social interaction with people. Not that i have social anxiety, but more like i just don't care. I happy being alone and binge watching Netflix.  I so hope things change soon because i do feel an improvement in my mood and Im much more patient and dont overreact to things that i used to. I used to cry everyday, bite my fingernails and pull my hair out. I was mean and irritable all the time. That has all gone away.

(started at 25mg, increased to 50mg) The first week was rough, my anxiety got worse, but I stuck with it, and it slowly noticed I was perseverating less, and felt freer from my overwhelming thoughts. My panic attacks have gotten less severe, and I'm able to participate in life more. A lot of people here have mentioned feeling emotionally numb on this med, which I have noticed to a small extent. However, for me, the benefits outweigh the side-effects. I'm also going to therapy regularly, and putting work into maintaining my emotional wellness - which I believe should go hand in hand with any medication.

I have taken almost every drug known to man for anxiety!!!   I always revert back to zoloft.  Beside Paxil and Buspar, those are the only REAL meds with anti anxiety properties to them that are NOT benzo and addictive.  The other anti depress can work but I really need it for anxiety 100% not depression.  I had reported that I got headaches and body aches due to jaw clenching and grinding teeth and scrunching up my body at night but I will take that over the other side effects from other meds.  If i stay at 100 mg and not go up to 150 mg then sex is not affected.  Never gain weight from this med.  I will give it a try again and deal with headaches!  This one truly does work for SAD, GADS, anxiety etc...  Oh its way cheaper than the other newer ones I was trying.

While I'm thankful that my mood is stable, the heartburn, constant state of sleepiness, and unquenchable thirst (dry mouth) really are hard to deal with. The heartburn happens about once or twice a month and comes with no known triggers as I take the pills with the same snack at the same time everyday. It's very uncomfortable to the extent that I had believed it was far more severe than heartburn at first. I'm constantly able to fall asleep no matter how much sleep I get. Possibly, Zoloft just makes me too tired to be sad. I suppose the drug is doing what it's meant to do: treat my depression. However, not having extreme heartburn for hours on end and never being able to feel fully awake are side effects I could do without.

Around the year mark the depression became much worse and I was extremely lethargic. I lost interest in everything, including friends and family. I wouldn't go on dates and it was all I could do to go to work. The odd thing was that I seemingly had everything a single person would want. A lake house, nice car, great job and my choice of who I wanted to date. 
However, people close to me had no idea that I became a recluse. They all assumed I was having the time of my life.
One morning I woke up and felt that I just couldn't take the pain anymore. I went to the kitchen, leaned over the sink with a large knife to my throat. While trying to decide if it would be better to instead cut my wrist, I stopped and called my doctor. I was surprised to hear her say to come right away to see her. When I drove to her office I was crying my eyes out because I hated who I had become. Thankfully my Dr didn't give up on me and actually up'd my dosage to 200mg. It honestly saved my life. I soon became depression free with the only side effect of still being lethargic. Also the dizzy brain zaps when I miss a dose.
I'm remarried and happy again, but always tired. My Dr. Has put me on a new medicine called Fetzima 20mg and has cut the Zoloft back to 100mg to help with the tiredness. So far so good after 3 weeks. I went through a few dizzy spells, but stuck with it and feel like my old self again.
If you or anyone you know has secluded themselves please know that there is hope. 
The first step is having someone who understands your sickness and that you don't choose to feel this way. 
The second step and hardest thing to do IMO is finding and then giving the medicine time to work. 
Best of luck."

Made my anxiety so bad that I couldn't sleep. Made my depression so bad that I didn't want to live. I sat in my dorm room on my bed 24/7, eating almost nothing, crying and sleeping all the time, and being terrified of everything. Walls talked to me, shadows seemed ready to attack. Every bad experience felt worse. I failed all my classes because I couldn't make myself go or understand anything I read anymore. My homework seemed to be written in another language. Even though I was a straight A student, I couldn't seem to use my brain at all. My throat burned after swallowing the pills. It was so bad that I've been too scared to try another anti depressant.

When I tried it I did not sleep for three nights and became so exhausted. Then I noticed my thoughts were calm but I was so detached that I thought I could drive into a wall or another car and I would be fine with that. Dangerous stuff. I stopped the first week on it.

I started with a full pill every other day and a half pill every other day. I'm currently on a half pill a day and just had my first anxiety attack in years; only this time I was able to control it better. I was told to expect these symptoms until I'm off it for a little while. Please, if/when you start coming off this medication DO NOT skip a meal.

It should be made a class A drug. It is basically legal bath salts. It gave me thoughts of carelessness, hostility, aggression, violence, increased sex drive, thoughts of rape, suicidal thoughts, irrational thoughts and I wanted to kill people I care about. I am a very Anxious person but all of those side effects are way out of my characteristics. One afternoon after a heated argument I went home angry and I had just had enough of Zoloft. I went against doctors orders and flushed all the Zolfot pills down the toilet. It was the best choice I ever made after enduring 3 days of horrible withdrawal effects. I am now on track to recovery. I have Anxiety Disorder and mild Depression. I warn you its not worth it. Never take Zoloft or any SSRIS drugs like that. Take my word for it. Trust me. I have finally got the courage to warn you and prevent you from making the same mistake as me. I would rather smoke 1 pack of cigarettes a day then take Zoloft.

People react differently to same medications we may be taking.. Go to a professional. who knows how and what to prescribe. My family has history of depression/anxiety the females in the family find that zoloft works well for all of us. (genetic?)  I was diagnosed with a anxiety problem at 13 yrs old.  Those were the days of valium..only. Very difficult time in life when these issues really weren't discussed. I didn't start taking anything until I was 42yrs.

My depression is gone (this is not a happy pill, I still get sad occasionally but not for no reason at all). My PTSD from my childhood is lifted, and my anxiety is definitely gone too. I still have OCD ticks, and obsessive organization thoughts and needs, but that is not something that this pill could rid of entirely. The only reason my satisfaction is a 4 star and not 5, is because when I wasn't taking my medication, I would get these awful brain zaps as I like to call them.

My MD suggested Zoloft. The starting dose was way too high so we backed off to 100mg a day. I know many feel that 100 is even a high dose, but it worked For me. I've been on a 100-150mg dose for 10 years (depends on need) and I can truly say it saved my life. I've had some side effects, but none bad enough to discontinue the med.
What I see in many of these reviews is concerning. Any med is going to take a while to get the full effect, especially anti-depressants. Stopping after a week because of an initial effect is not getting the full benefit. Give it a chance, it might actually work. Also, there are many factors that can cause these side effects I'm seeing: other meds, age, pre existing issues. Be careful and talk to your MD, there might be a good reason for side effects and maybe it's not the Zoloft.

Very happy and small things didnt bother me like they used to I became very laid back and chill. After about a month I leveled out and doctor increased my dose to 100mg, been on this for about 4 months and felt great however I started gaining weight, alot. being 5' and always in shape- I work out all the time and eat healthy and now jumping up to 115lbs which 10lb increase despite my heavy cardio was intese for me. I decreased my dosage back to 50mg and now trying to wean off all together. Trying to get pregnant so dropped it down to 25mg.. been off the medication for one week and I feel very sick. Dizzy and highly irritable and extremely emotional- crying and needy. I feel worse than before I started the medication. Any suggestions? I dont want to be on this if I get pregnant. Become depressed over weight gain, almost feel as if I should never have taken anything and just tried to deal with life head on.

Basically made my life ""flat"", not great, not bad. It was hard for me to ever get excited about anything while at the same time keeping me from bottoming out.  My life became a constant state of apathy but all the while I would contemplate suicide.  I finally quit taking it and while depression has crept back into my life, at least I am not entertaining taking it away at my own hand.

I have been taking 25 mg. for 4 months. I feel so much better! depression gone, intrusive thoughts much better and PMS has eased. Nights sweats every night, sometimes sleepy all day, other times times tons of energy.  I had extreme anxiety which caused me too be underweight, starting weight before meds were 90lbs...4 months later...101 lbs.  Ferocious appetite and never full.  These factors outweigh the good that zoloft has given me.  I realize i was in a terrible state and really needed help.

Over the next couple months, I noticed that my hair had gotten thinner. By December it was coming out in the handfuls. I have been off of Sertraline for 3 weeks now and have not seen any signs of improvement. Being a 20 year old female college student with very long hair, this was a huge deal for me. It resulted in cutting my hair 10 inches, just so that when my hair fell out, it wouldn't be in such long strands. I would consider this to be a severe side effect, considering it resulted in lowered self esteem and returning depression.

My day to day was getting so bad that I would cry at the drop of a hat, over practically nothing.  I was argumentative to everyone and always negative. My doctor started me on 25mg of Sertraline (generic) and its like the heavens have opened up. I'm so look much happier and positive. I very rarely cry if at all, and only when warranted.  I haven't had any side effects at all. I take it in the mornings when getting ready.  Part of the routine.  I can't believe I was so stubborn all those years. I'm sure I missed out on a lot of life.  My OCD is reduced, my social anxiety is reduced, I'm finding that I'm even becoming more bold in trying new things.  I took a flight from California to Texas by myself which I would have NEVER done prior to taking this medicine.  EVER!.  LIFE IS GREAT NOW!

159$Condition: Panic Disorder$12/17/2014 10:25:14 AM$Reviewer: Powder926, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$3$I suffered severe anxiety and could not bring myself to go to work. Out of fear of being fired I went to my doc and was given Zoloft 50 mg. I felt so defeated. But within the first week began to feel better. I went back and had my dose raised to 75 mg the second week and was able to return to work. Still with some anxiety but no panic. Third week I went to 100 mg and on the 4th day had a panic attack at work. I took off a couple days and went back to 75 mg. third day I started to feel better again. I know we all want to feel better as soon as possible but more is not always better especially at first. I'm going to stay on this dose for a full 8 weeks before I reevaluate. It's very common to experience increased anxiety/insomnia when increasing. My experience is this med makes me wired for 12-15 hours then I crash. So taking it first thing in the morning with food is best for me. I tried splitting my dose 50 morning 25 in evening and felt like death the next morning. My sleep is still disturbed. I crash for 3 hours and wake up wired. Sometimes I can fall back to sleep. If I can't I take some zzzquil or smal dose of Xanax. But I'm terrified of benzos as the withdrawals are some of the worst I've been through. At only 3 weeks on this med today I can say I'm able to function again. I'll give another update in a few weeks when I've reached its full benefit.

My moodiness, irritability, sadness, and anxiousness are much more controlable and I feel like I can cope with life now.  However, it is not without side-effects.  The first 3 weeks I had diarrhea and headaches, but not major enough to stop trying it.  After a month, the cloud lifted and I started enjoying life again.  Six months later, though, other side effects such as loss of libido crept in.  I have never had a problem maintaining my weight, and have always had a fast metabolism. After  18 months on this drug I have gained 15 pounds (all within the last 6 months).  So, it's a tradeoff.  Life is not perfect, but it's good...

I was on it for OCD and depression, plus panic without agoraphobia.  It did not help with my anxiety or my OCD, and I was more stressed on it than I have been on any antidepressant except Celexa.  It may have helped with the depression some, but I didn't feel much better.  I didn't have a whole lot of obsessions on it, but the compulsions were as bad as they were  without it.

I am so impressed with this medication! I needed it for my extreme social anxiety/panic attacks and depression. The first day I took one 25mg dose right before going to run errands and within 2 hours I had absolutely zero anxiety for the first time in my life. I felt a sense of euphoria and peace yet I was giddy/excited at the same time. I was able to make eye contact with people, and not feel anxious talking to anyone. It was like I felt reassured and that nothing bad was gonna happen to me. As I was driving I was completely calm and I used to get all my panic attacks when driving! As for the depression that will probably take a couple months for the pill to build in my system, but having no anxiety alone has made me an extremely happier person.

As for the side effects I'm not going to sugar coat it in the least. I was not able to sleep for 4 days. My mind would race at night and I could not stop tossing and turning. Today I had my doctor prescribe me Hydroxyzene to help me sleep. (We'll see how that goes) It also makes my hands tremble to the point where people have asked me if I was ok. That has gone down quite a bit though. I have had slight appetite loss, but am still able to eat normally. I have stayed at 150lbs for a year and today I weigh 145lbs. Kind of awesome. I have had a couple terrible bouts of diarrhea. And lastly I had to go buy a nightguard (mouthpiece) because I clench my teeth really bad at night now. 

So, in regards to the side effects, I think that it's just my body's way of getting used to it. Today is day 4 and most of the side effects are nearly gone. I recommend this med to anyone who suffers extreme anxiety. It zaps it right out of your body. It saved my life!!! "

I have gone off it, and I never had any adverse reactions, and I actually lost weight..not that I could afford to, but I do not see how so many claim it made them gain up to 30 pounds. This med controlled my OCD so I was able to live. As for people saying they gained 30 to 50 pounds, sorry but I think it is an excuse. Maybe some gain 5 to 10, but why would you let yourself gain 20 or more pounds ""due"" to the medicine? Would not one change meds, talk to their doctor, whatever? I am sorry but using this med as an excuse for overeating and telling others that is why they gained weight is irresponsible. If someone who could really benefit from it may stop taking it because of people posting things as such online. And if you have severe OCD this is a miracle, I gained my life back."

I have terrible anxiety/panic disorder and my doctor thought it would be a good fit for me. Now, I do know it works for some people, so I'm trying not to discredit that, however: night one I was really drowsy, and about five hours later I woke up in the early, early morning terribly anxious and sick to my stomach. Threw up and had 'D', tried drinking water, threw up again, and dry heaved on and off for a while. Had to go to the ER because I was super hydrated. I already have stomach problems associated with anxiety, so maybe it wasn't a good choice to go with a drug whose primary side effect is upset stomach. Just be careful if you'e going into this with stomach issues...you might be fine, but you might not be. Doctor is having me try Lexapro now, so we'll see how that goes.

It has sexual side-effects and if you look at the sheets, they say sometimes they are permanent.   I am not willing to take that risk but your doctor may be willing to gamble it on you.

186$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/24/2014 4:55:10 PM$Reviewer: Hope, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This is the first review I have ever made in my life.  When I was going to start taking this medication I did research and I read these reviews and found them helpful. I was very scared to take an anti-depressant because I was afraid of how it would make me feel and did not want to take drugs. I had this idea in my head that this medicine would make me feel groggy, not myself and weird. Well what was I thinking! I was laying around half dead, depressed, OVERWHELMING anxiety, panic attacks...so I would have been better off feeling weird, groggy!!! BUT this medicine has helped me GREATLY. GREATLY. Before I started taking this medicine I lost my job, could not function, I thought I was dying. I feel much much better. I am so glad that I was responsible enough to start taking this medication. I now have a job I love, I am back to getting dressed up, I feel pretty again. I even started wearing perfume again! I look like I had a makeover! I used to dress nice and look great until I suffered a VERY traumatic event. I suffered from on and off anxiety before but all it took was an event and I spiraled down and my world flipped. PLEASE try this. Give it AT LEAST four weeks to work. Slowly each day everything will start to feel normal again. Youll also have to put in your own work too by trying to minimize stress, allow yourself extra time in the morning to dress, eat right, sleep. This drug is really amazing. My next challenge though is whether to take this when I decide to become pregnant. Some doctors say its ok as benefits outweigh risk. But I guess I will cross that bridge when I approach it. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is something to also consider while on this medication. I am looking into that as well. Good lUCK to all of you and please try it. Take it each day at the same time and if you need to consult doctor on increasing it do it!!! I had mild diahreah and nausea at first, but it went away. Nothing that would make me want to stop taking it.

A little too quickly from what my doctor told me.  Only side effect was a spongy/cotton ball feeling and forgetfulness. I'm trying Bupropion HCL XL at my doctors recommendation.

The combination has been extremely effective with no side effects other than moderate weight gain.  I have gained 30 pounds over 10 years.  However, I would rather be 30 pounds heavier and not feel intense anxiety, cry frequently, feel unable to handle life, be paralyzed, feel depressed-suicidal, have irrational thoughts, etc.  he Zoloft turns the irrational thoughts off like a light switch!  I also did cognitive behavior therapy the first two years of my diagnosis which helped.  I will occasionally take a low dose of Xanax once every 3-4 months for extremely stressful- anxious situations. I have been happy, enjoy life, am confident, sleep great, and feel like I can successfully handle life.  I exercise for 45 minutes 5-7 days a week, eat fairly healthy, and keep my sleep/wake cycle the same.  I tried 3 different drugs before finding a combination that worked. Sometimes side effects last a couple weeks, or it takes a month to titrate up to a full dosage.  I recommend sticking it out for 6 weeks to give any medication a chance unless you are completely miserable or develop an allergic reaction.

Well I have learned that is not true. I was feeling so depressed and useless. Cried about nothing and everything. Dr. put me on 25mg. Zoloft and within a few days I felt like a new person.That was a little over a year ago.No side effects, not weight gain, stomach problems nothing. Everyone is different.I'm wondering if some of the problem is Dr's over medicating at the start. I have not had to up my dosage. My life is so much better since I started taking zoloft.No more crying about every little thing. It has been a life saver for me.Again may not be the same for everyone.I am now a young 80 yrs. old.

Gained 55+ lbs., which I totally attribute to Zoloft for slowing down my metabolism, causing cravings and the need for late night ravenous eating. Never did that before. Tried weaning then stopping 2 times but went back on it each time because I felt miserable.  This time....I've been weaning off slowly for months and finally stopped 6 days ago. Getting off of Zoloft is an AWFUL EXPERIENCE even with months of weaning. Again, today is Day 6 of being off Zoloft... Still having brain zaps, dizziness, crabbiness, OCD like actions, shivers, my family is wanting to disown me. Good note - My cravings are subsiding, listening to music is different, I like ""me"" better even with the miserable effects above. I told myself and my family I am not going back on it and threw the pills away. Zoloft got me through my situation 13 years ago but I think its time to find an alternate solution.  I pray I can stay off of it this time. "

My day to day life has changed from a constant battle to a breeze. Now I finally feel my normal self again, I realise how anxious and depressed I was. I am a intelligent high functioning person that still got by on shear will power. I have been taking it 2 months and only take 3/4 of a 50mg Sertraline.
I am a different, relaxed, happy person. I sleep well, I think clearer, I want to do stuff again. Its amazing what this drug has done for me.

I started on half a tablet 25 mg a day and had major side effects, felt ill, got more depressed then ever, didnt sleep at all, felt sick, massive headaches, diarrhoea, very, very down, it was aweful...Just because some reviews told me to not give up and a supportive partner I pulled through...it took over 2 weeks to lessen these side effects and probably 3-4 weeks to really start to notice this huge dark cloud to lift..

START ON A LOW DOSE AND GIVE THIS DRUG TIME, DON'T JUDGE IT IN THE FIRST 2-4 weeks!!!

Because of this, I have been prescribed and tried different anti-depressants and mood stabilizers that were not effective and made me gain weight. Two years ago, I was rediagnosed as having depression and was told to try Zoloft. Compared to all of the other meds I've been on, this is a wonder drug! I still have some sad days, but I am able to move forward with my life and focus on the good things rather than experience countless moments where I was suicidal and thought that life was not worth living. I do experience dry mouth and need to take this on a full stomach or else I get really bad heart burn. However these side effects are worth it if I am able to function on a day to day basis.

210$Condition: Depression$4/24/2014 4:42:23 PM$Reviewer: Kate, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have struggled with an eating disorder, anxiety and very bad depression with suicidal thoughts for 4+ years. When I got to my lowest point I decided to try anti-depressants. Like most people, I was afraid that it would make me numb, emotionless, etc, but that didn't happen at all. I started out with 50mg a day. Once I had been taking them for a few weeks I already felt a difference in how I look at myself and other people (my family and boyfriend) noticed it too. Several months into taking Zoloft I hit a plateau. When I told my doctor that, she said that was very normal and upped my dosage to 100mg. The only negative side effect I have experienced is the night sweats ONCE IN A WHILE. Yes, they are uncomfortable and it's annoying to wake up feeling cold, but really clammy and sweaty, but the positive effects of the drug outweigh the negative sides in my opinion. My depression also interfered with my sleeping pattern. I would go through a couple days to a week or more of being so fatigued ALL the time and sleeping way more than I should, and then other times where I am so restless that I continuously toss and turn in bed and finally give up and just stay up all night. So, my doctor prescribed me Trazodone (helps with insomnia and is an anti-depressant) to take along with Zoloft. These two drugs together have worked very well for me regarding general depression symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, disordered eating, etc. 
211$Condition: Depression$4/22/2014 11:18:02 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$5$I was given this drug in order to deal with the death of my fiance. Once I took it, I was emotionless. I could not cry to save my life. That is not how I want to feel. I need to release this hurt and now it is being blocked. I feel strange. I know that the need to cry is there, but by it being trapped, it is making me anxious and jittery. I am able to sleep, but when I awaken, I feel distant. I feel like my body is not mine. I am not sure what the intended effect of this medication is suppose to be, but I do not like the way it makes me feel. I was given 50mg and told to start off with 1/2 (25mg). The 25mg seems to be too much for me. The day of the funeral, I know I was being looked at because of my lack of tears. They just would not come out. I was like a zombie going through the motions. I am trying to get a hold of someone to see whether or not I am able to get on something more balancing. I feel as though I am about to have a panic attack. 
212$Condition: Panic Disorder$4/17/2014 7:37:04 PM$Reviewer: purplebttrfls, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$I had severe anxiety from the time I woke in the morning until I went to bed, also panic attacks through the day. I was in a very dark panic world and knew I needed help.  The doctor gave me Zoloft and I was afraid of taking pills so I started with only 1/2 of a 25mg pill for a week.  I increased it to 25mg a day and that's where I am for now.  I want people to read this and know it may not be pleasant when you first start an antidepressant but try to keep in mind it takes time.  I came back to these reviews quite a few times to read for my personal support to get through all the side effects.  I had every common side effect there is and some from the uncommon. I would wake in the morning and think ok what side effect will I have today. Most of them are gone, I still live with a few side effects, 2 of the most annoying are the twitching muscles and itching on the side of my face and neck but I will take them over the way I was living before. I also used Xanax to get me through the first 2 months of starting Zoloft. Zoloft helped my anxiety 95% and I hope it will continue to get better.  Today on my way home from work I found myself singing with the radio to a song and enjoying the sunshine, I have not felt like that in a very long time.  I hope this will be some ones support like others comments before me were mine.  Give it time to work.  And if Zoloft doesn't help you don't give up try another until you find that happiness again.

Then after that I felt like I could not feel happy or sad for about a week. Then at about the 3rd week I levelled out. I did have an increase in sexual desire and could not ejaculate as quickly as I did before. I did read about lots of people that had a lower libido but this was not true fore me. Overall, it was good for levelling out emotional imbalances.

I'm smaller, so I got the lowest dosage (50mg) and cut that in half, so i was taking 25mg/day. I was fine for the first two weeks, but then when the third (this week) hit, my depression stooped to a new low. My arms are literally covered in really bad s/h cuts(more like gashes) and I tried to hang myself twice. If you are small and young, DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. It made me tired all the time to the point of hardly being able to function, and despite my huge appetite and constant eating I lost 5 lbs in TWO days. I went from 108 lbs to 103 lbs. I keep getting wicked headaches, I keep hurting myself, and I've seemed to lose all self control. Zoloft has made my life a living hell. It's terrible. 
245$Condition: Depression$1/16/2014 1:35:27 PM$Reviewer: Julia S., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$I was prescribed Zoloft for postpartum depression after my second child was born.  Within days I had awful side effects - sweats, chills, nausea, headaches.  I tried it for a few weeks and then went to my PCP.  She said that I'd have to quit nursing and go on tricyclics, and that breastfeeding wasn't a big deal, formula is fine.  Note to self: don't listen to PCPs when it comes to antidepressants!  For a new mom with PPD, that was the worst thing to say.  I went sobbing to my therapist, who promptly squeezed me in to see a psychiatrist.  She explained that each SSRI is different, and that we'd try meds until we found something that worked.  She switched me to Celexa immediately, and as I tapered off Zoloft, the side effects disappeared.  I did have problems when I came off Celexa, but the key is if one med doesn't work for you, try another - AND work with a good psychiatrist not a PCP when it comes to medication.  
246$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/15/2014 5:34:55 PM$Reviewer: ChasVII, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"Prescribed for panic attacks @ 50 mg with Xanax to get me over the rough spots until the Zoloft could kick in. I combined this with a few counselling sessions with my primary care that were very helpful. First few weeks were like I wasn't taking anything at all. No noticeable therapeutic effect and no side effects. This is exactly what my Dr. told me to expect, and I imagine that I was very 'suggestible' at that point, so in short, there were no surprises, no drama.

The Xanax was really kind of fun, which made me not want to get too used to having it around, but it did help back me away from that 'edge' (I'm sure the other panic folks will understand.) It was a great call on my Dr's part though, because as the Zoloft kicked in I was just less inclined to go looking for the Xanax.

We tweaked the dosage for the first few months 50 => 100 => 75 while I worked on some other stress management techniques (exercise, music, turning *OFF* the TV news) after which I found that I could get by quite nicely at the original 50 mg / day.

Over time I started feeling that while it smoothed out the low spots, it also shaved off the peaks of my day to day experience. I was fully functional, but while there were no horrors, there were also no thrills. Then that 'fully functional' but not thrilling description started carrying over into my sex life and work experience, too.

So after about 14 months I just started tapering off my dose from 50/day to 25/day to 25 every other day to none. My demons didn't come back, and I didn't have any ill effects from stopping. The Zoloft had done what my Dr. and I had hoped with no lasting collateral damage.

Now after 3 years without any meds a very tumultuous year has brought me back to that edge. Knowing that you are having a panic attack is better than thinking you are having a heart attack, but it does not make them any less intense. I started a new Zoloft script yesterday, hopefully it works like last time. Hope this helps you! "

After 3 months and 100mg dose per day up from 50mg which didn't do anything, I started getting extremely extremely ill. Now, I will note that for about a month or so I felt a huge difference and It was effective in reducing my anxiety/depression however the side effects ending up being detrimental. I had to have an endoscopy (camera down throat to see stomach) to prove the medication irritated my stomach. Zoloft caused extreme nausea, no appetite. It was horrible, and I threw up for 2 months ever morning because I was taking the zoloft before I went to bed. Long story short, the drug caused excess stomach acid to build up, created irritation, and made me throw up for months and feel waves of nausea hit me like a brick in the middle of the day. After being off of it for 1-2 months my stomach is still not back to its normal calm state. I have switched to Remeron which so far is helping (very mildly) but with zero side effects! It is helping my appetite since the zoloft made me on the verge of being extremely underweight, and I was already thin to begin with. Also, I currently take ""lansoprazole"" which works wonders for me (prilosec doesn't work for me)it is a 24 hour acid reducer. Anxiety and Depression pills cause so many GI issues.

I am normally average weight, sometimes leaning toward underweight, and I eat pretty healthily, although I do pig out here and there. But I have never been overweight. At least until Zoloft. I gained 20 lbs the first time, and almost 30 the second, and both times the weight was hell to lose. I've been off it for a year now and am back to my regular size, but it took 5 months of strict low-carb dieting and vigorous exercise to get to this point. And that was after 4 months of just being med-free and letting my body go back to normal. It screwed with my metabolism, and it takes a while to bounce back. It did help my depression, it just made me feel horrible about myself. I've been taking 100mg 5HTP daily for 7 months along with rhodiola rosea. For the first 2 weeks, 5htp made me sleepy, but now, it's better than Zoloft. And it curbs my appetite! I feel great and normal and I'm so happy to be off pharms and still feeling good. I'm passionate about my hobbies again, something that I still lacked even on Zoloft.

Initially, I was taking this with Lorazapam to help with my anxiety, and it was amazing; I felt calm and capable. Two weeks later my doctor upped my dosage from 50mg to 100 mg and advised me only to take the Lorazapam as needed. For two weeks I felt like I was having a psychotic episode, while also feeling paralyzed, as if I were in a straight jacket. I told my doctor this, and he recommended to up my dosage again (150mg) and go back on the Lorazapam. I have been feeling extremely exhausted, and don't have the desire to do anything. I am currently in grad school and am worried about how this will effect my performance. Already, I feel completely behind. One benefit of this drug is that I haven't had any suicidal thoughts 
(though perhaps that's because I feel like I am in a straight jacket and incapable of doing anything?). Another benefit is that I've been able to interact normally in social situations and have finally begun to develop friendships within my program. Common side effects: I've been sweating a lot, and I haven't been eating. It's actually difficult to eat sometimes, and I have to force myself. I also haven't been sleeping that much, and only do when I take the Lorazapam. My sex drive isn't as high as it used to be, but I'm feeling as if that might be a good thing for the time being--who knows how I'll feel about that in a few months though. I'm going to continue with this treatment for now, but can't say it's been that great so far. Crossing my fingers."

After being urged constantly by my psychologist to give it at least 2-4 weeks, I finally agreed to give it another try; which was huge for me, considering I was a skeptic on mood alternating drugs. I was recommended by my psychologist to take a quarter, orally twice a day and then in 4 days do half orally twice a day. So then my body would slowly adjust, for reduced symptoms. I was 16 when I first started so... yes I was young to be on some kind of anti-depressant. It's Been 2 1/2 months since, and I'm so happy I gave it time to balance the chemicals in my brain instead of being impatient and expecting it to be a utopia the first day of use. It has helped me tremendously with social anxiety, OCD, and chronic depression. The side affects start to decrease around week two. Luckly I never had any of the serious side affects such as increased body weight, insensitivity, and the most dreaded of all a decrease of limbo. I only experienced the jitters and loss of body weight; which was a nice bonus of course. ;) so in the end... were all different chemically and emotionally so it may or may not be the drug for you, but personally I'm on 150mg a day and so far... well it's been a huge help.

I felt so good, after starting up a health regime of Advocare Supplements, that I stopped taking my prescription. Was great for two years. I then started my 50mg of Sertraline, and started having intense adverse reactions. Burning of face, arms, legs, rapid heart rate, dry mouth, lack of appetite for days on end, 20 pound weight loss,major anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia,tingling, hives, ect.. I tried my hardest to ""work through the symptoms"" and they did decrease a smidge after 3 weeks, until It was suggested that I up my dose to 100mg because of the anxiety.. NOT A GOOD IDEA AT ALL.. rapid heart rate, burning, scorched mouth and throat, and all symptoms listed from above...  Needless to say, I was then advised per Dr. to stop taking Setraline Cold Turkey.. That was 10 days ago. Within days my anxiety left, the burning left, my mouth is still burnt, and I have some numbness and tingling on my arms and leg, and dryness on my face that is now turning into a rash.. but overall the symptoms are decreasing by the day. Insomnia is gone, hunger returned ( with a vengence). All of this I withstood for 44 days..Now I am on day 54, and feeling more and more better each day.. I just cant wait until ALL of the remnant toxins are gone from my body FOR GOOD.  "

319$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/21/2013 1:40:52 AM$Reviewer: Happy Man, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I originally began with Celexa 10mg right when I graduated high school [when I decided to treat my severe depression].  At first, the Celexa worked for the first month, but then the benefits wore off relatively quickly.  Overall, the Celexa had generally low side-effect profile, it just made me lethargic at times.  After the Celexa, I was put on Lexapro [which is in fact the stereoisomer to Celexa]; however, I thought the Lexapro was absolutely ineffective.  Finally, I've been taking Zoloft for the past few months now and it is a miracle.  I haven't had an anxiety attack since I started it, my depression seems to have significantly faded, and I can do things normally again.  Again, this drug is fantastic, I have finally found personal contentment.  In brief, I had a mix of general bipolar, mild OCD, and moderate anxiety disorder.  In fact, I tried the Ativan as an icebreaker, but the Zoloft was actually more effective.  This drug--has worked my life wonders.

Then the tremors kicked in and had to quite it.  I switched back over to paxil because of the brain fog and my cognitive skills were just gone but did help more with my anxiey but the side effects were just to much.  So now I'm back on paxil and only on 10mg a day but want to try prisq.  The only way I could be on Zoloft was with klonopin which worked great because zoloft does lift you up alot more than the lethagic feeling of paxil.  Just want to feel normal and thought the Zoloft would work for me so here we go again.  Just want to feel better and not zoned out.

My problem was with anxiety, & I became very sick. I began by trying Celexa & it made me feel worse & very agitated. After 3 weeks I switched to Zoloft & about 2 days later I noticed an improvement & began feeling a little better - I woke up one morning with less of the usual symptoms of anxiety, & was also in a better mood & feeling happier (Zoloft is an anti-depressant). Everyone is different, & from my experience it does take about 3 to 4 weeks for the medication to really kick in & start working. After that, by the 3rd month I was feeling even better & the side effects really subsided & did go  away. So what to expect from the side effects? I had trouble sleeping & took 0.5mg of Atavan to relax me & fall asleep. It helped a lot, & after 3 months I did not need it anymore & my sleep pattern returned to normal. As for sex, there was really no problem, maybe a little bit longer to orgasm, but no need to worry about sexual dysfunction. As for alcohol, they say a little or none which is likely best, but I still drink the same & feel fine. A very noticeable side effect was sweating which came & went throughout the day. Also, I love the heat but was not as tolerant to it. You may gain a few pounds, but no serious weight gain. The good news is that as you continue to take Zoloft, you continue to feel better & better, & most everything eventually returns to normal. In my case, I now feel like I did before I ever experienced a problem with anxiety. As well, I feel much happier, in a good mood, and worry much less. This medication helps you to think sharper and more clearly rather than panicking. Your reasoning & ability to think logically is much stronger. A year ago I was counting the days to get off this medication...& now thank G-d, I wouldn't dare go off of it - I thought I would never say that! Good luck if you decide to try Zoloft, hoping you have the same positive result as I did.

The first time I took this drug I was so afraid of having a side effect that I had a severe panic attack. I thought it was a bad reaction to the drug but finally realized that it had nothing to do with the drug so I tried it again. For the first week I kinda felt like a zombie...I was just dragging like I was in slow motion. That feeling went away after the first week and a half,,,,and I started to feel ""normal"" after a couple of weeks. My panic attacks subsided and I was able to sleep at night. I have had very few panic-like episodes since being on Zoloft. It has definitely worked for me. My dr says I have to stay on for a full year, and then come down to 25 mg and then come off.

One thing that has not gone away is inability to put my thoughts in into words properly.  I tend to talk as if my thoughts and words are slowed-down and dyslexic/backwards.  Also, my sexual desire is about 1%-which is not good, esp for my marriage to a good man.

Happy, excited, depressed, angry, irritated, etc. I just feel off and unbalanced. It drives me crazy. I have taken Prozac, Celexa, and Zoloft. My body kept getting use to the Prozac and Celex. I didn't want to just keep up'ing the dose, so my doctor switched me to Zoloft. I felt great. Better then I had with the other 2 pills. My moods felt balanced. BUT... then I started to notice that my clothes were getting a little tight. For some reason, I was starting to crave french fries, a lot. In talking with my neighbor (who also takes Zoloft - and has gained at least 30 lbs), she said her doctor advised her that it may cause her to crave carbs. She said that she craves french fries. Ding ding! Now I know why I've been gaining weight. The cravings are ridiculous and I just can't do it anymore. The effects are starting to wear off as well (with just taking 1 pill) and I've asked the doctor to switch my pill. The weight gain definitely isn't worth it to me. 
352$Condition: Depression$6/9/2013 11:32:01 AM$Reviewer: rolani22, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I was very very very depressed and my doctor prescribed me Zoloft. And it has worked beautifully. I feel ten times better. No more sadness, suicidal thoughts, lack of motivation, none of that. The only negative about Zoloft or probably any antidepressant is that when you first start taking it you go down before you go up. Also the firsr month or so you will feel pretty mellowed out. Not down but not really up either. It's not a bad feeling it just kind of took me by surprise. But really after being on Zoloft for five months my life has drastically improved. It's worth a try.

In 2006 I was prescibed this for post-natal depression I was on it for about 6 months and found it good but then no longer needed it. 
Lately things have been building up and I was feeling extremely anxious, irrational, irratable, panic attacks, the whole world is against me, just horrible horrible feelings. never suicidal. I have three kids and am all about self-preservation. However I have a history of depression in my family. My dear Dad took his own life in 2004.
Yesterday my Doc put me back on Zoloft (I got Eleva which is the same) and within two hours yes just two hours I felt Great! my muscles relaxed, skin felt smooth, I couldnt stop smiling at my husband and kids where usually I scowl and I even had a giggling fit when my son was telling me something not even funny. Today I woke up feeling good, the ""noise"" in my head is just not there. I am so happy to have found Zoloft again. I dont care if it's ""fake"" happy, its happy where happy wasn't before so for me, its all good.
I need this to be a better wife and mother. "

I went from being virtually house-bound for three years to being able to work a simple public job, which had been impossible before. Zoloft erased most of my social anxiety within the span of six months, although I still dislike overly crowded places and refuse to have friends outside of my family. This is an improvement on my previous disposition. However, the social anxiety warped into general anxiety and it worsened my OCD, and I began having panic attacks almost daily. 

Before Zoloft I bottled every emotion and could not comprehend feelings -- while taking Zoloft I began to feel complex emotions such as anger for the first time. It improved me in some ways, and I would recommend it to others with similar issues. It has enabled me to be extremely productive in some aspects, such as being able to complete something with several steps in 2 minutes that would have taken me 20 minutes without medication. It also unfortunately removed my creative ability to write stories in my free time, a career path I had originally hoped for. (Apparently I needed OCD to write!)

After about a year of taking Zoloft, I am not sure if my body has become saturated with it or not, but it is not working right. Raising/lowering the dosage does not work to get rid of its side effects anymore. Now, if my OCD routine gets disturbed or if I'm surprised/upset, I either get a panic attack regardless of the zoloft in my system, or my brain gets extremely fuzzy. I feel confused, unable to move, heavy-headed and unable to grasp or verbalize complex thoughts. This fuzzy-brain feeling lasts for about an hour or longer until I am able to calm down. It essentially makes me unable to work if a customer says something to upset me. 

I am talking to my doctor tomorrow about switching medications. Zoloft has helped me grow, but it is no longer right for my specific situation."

I felt totally different, and did not wake up with the anxiety and dread that had plagued me since my early youth.

Over the years, my dose increased, and I am  now taking 200 mg 1x daily. Zoloft works very well for me, with no apparent side effects. No other antidepressant worked for me.

I'm happy, productive, and even tempered. I'll be on Zoloft for the rest of my life, but it's worth it!

I started taking this medication about 12 yrs ago. I could not believe how well this worked for me. Fortunately, I found this and another medication very helpful with ALL of my mental conditions. MDD,GAD,PTSD.

I was in total disbelief b/c I had tried just about every anti-depressant drugs I had tried failed. One worked for a while,then seemed to stop working. 

Anyhow,I have less suicidal thoughts,and other awful symptoms of MDD(Major Depressive Disorder) taking this medication."

I took it that evening and immediately had a reaction. I couldn't sleep, couldn't stay still, my whole body hurt, I felt like I was literally burning up, like my skin was actually on fire (although no fever) and the anxiety was through the roof. I also felt like I wasn't able to get my brain back in my head. I know that sounds weird, but it was everywhere! I just huddled on the bed crying. Called the 24 hour pharmacist who said this was normal.  Called doc next morning who said the side effects should go away, don't take another zoloft. About 5 hours later still unable to cope, although the physical symptoms had passed the mental symptoms hadn't my doc said if I didn't get to the hospital he would call the ambulance.  I was then on a psych ward for 5 days trying to get 'back under control' I am now scared of ALL meds and only take Klonopin on a daily basis.  If you do try any of these SSRI's I suggest starting at a VERY low dose and building.

425$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$1/18/2013 9:00:22 PM$Reviewer: PEsSuCK, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$5$I have PTSD from pulmonary embolisms that tried to kill me in March of 2012. I started taking Zoloft to help with the anxiety. I also have to take blood thinners forever due to the embolisms. After taking Zoloft for 6 days, I got a red rash on my stomach -- it looked like a heat rash. Then I noticed a big ugly bruise on my calf -- about 4 inches x 3 inches. I know that Zoloft and my blood thinners can be a bad mix -- causing internal bleeding -- so I went to the ER. My blood tests came back okay and the doctor didn't seem too concerned with my red rash. I was told to continue the meds and go see my regular doc in a few days. I did, and by then I was starting to get a 'rash' on my lower legs. My doc wasn't too concerned, so I kept taking the meds as told. Then the spots on my legs got worse and started showing up on my back. I looked it up to see what it was, and found out that it was peteciae (internal hemmoraging) leaving tiny bruises all over my legs. I called my doc and was told to stop the Zoloft. When I went to have my blood levels checked for my blood thinners a couple days later, my blood was way too thin and I was at a risk of internal bleeding. I think Zoloft would have maybe worked better for me if my doctor and the coumadin clinic would have kept a closer eye on the drug interactions taking place -- and adjusting the blood thinners as needed. Although, with the red rash on my stomach, I was probably allergic to it, anyway. So -- if you are on Coumadin or Warfarin -- be super careful about taking Zoloft!

482$Condition: Depression$10/5/2012 10:10:47 AM$Reviewer: GeorgiaPeach, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been struggling with post-partum depression since the birth of my child almost 8 months ago.  I initially refused medication because I was breastfeeding and worried it would affect my child.  I was very tired and sluggish all the time, and had occasional bad days when I felt like I was just down in a hole and all I wanted to do was sleep.  Even on the best days I was chronically tired.  I often felt complete disinterest in my child, and I lost interest in my hobbies- riding my horses seemed like too much work, and I was way too tired to even consider exercising.

I also had trouble with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by even routine daily tasks.  I had a lot of irrational guilt as well.

Zoloft literally changed my life overnight.  I feel 100% normal, the way I did before I ever got pregnant.  1 50mg zoloft a day has worked wonders.  I was afraid I'd feel doped up but all I feel is normal.  I have my normal energy level back, I'm enjoying my baby, I'm riding my horses again, it's wonderful.

I was afraid after reading the bad reviews that this medicine would give me bad side effects, but so far  have not experienced any side effects at all.  I strongly encourage anyone suffering from depresion to give this medicine a chance- it might work just as well for you as it has for me.  I wish I had started taking it months ago.  "

I am so sorry I hadn't done it sooner!  I did have some side effects the first few weeks (upset stomach, drowsiness) but stuck with it.  I found that taking it in the evening after dinner helped.  I find I am still a little drowsier than usual but the anxiety is manageable and the panic attacks have been reduced to almost non-existent.  If you are hesitant to take medication, I understand, believe me I was too, but this has improved my quality of life significantly."

And then when my doctor finally took me off, the side effects became even more unbearable.  Symptoms that I had never experienced BEFORE going on Zoloft showed up when I tried to get off it: extreme volatility, severe depression, suicidal thoughts, joint pain, constant nausea, and so on.

The side effects that I have are insomnia, VERY crazy dreams, VERY vivid dreams, sex drive is nonexistant and coming to an orgasm is tricky.  For the insomnia I purchased melatonin and I take it when I NEED sleep because I can't function.  Usually one a week.  The dreams can be good or bad but the fact that I can remember them can be horrible when they're bad dreams because it feels like I'm awake.  My sex drive tanked but I have a great significant other and he makes sure that the mood is set and when I have trouble having an orgasm we just take our time, go slow and talk to each other.  Since I've been taking the medication I've only had an issue with an orgasm 3 or 4 times.

I also had a cocaine habit which contributed to the deep depressed state I was in. As a bonus it completely curbed any craving for cocaine. It was like Chantix would do for a smoker only it didn't take seven days to work. It worked as soon as the Zoloft took effect. I am not sure if any doctor has been made aware of this extra benefit. If not I hope a doctor or a pharmaceutical rep reads this and researches this so Zoloft can be used in treatment for addictive disorders as well as a treatment for depression.

I felt such relief that, I continued taking it every day and now take a very small, 25mg dose daily (I am a petite, sensitive person). I sleep better, wake feeling glad to be alive. My hormones no longer control my emotions and I respond rather than reacting to charged situations. I have no social anxiety (which I suffered before and which prevented me from going to some really fun places/events), I have not gained a single pound, can drink wine, live a normal life with no compromise and feel totally at peace. My Dr. says I am the 'poster child' for this drug. I will say however, that for the first, few months I was on the generic and had terrible gas and lose stools, also excessive underarm perspiration. Since going on the brand, those side effects have completely gone. It takes me a little longer to orgasm sometimes and my sex drive is slighty less, but it's a small price to pay for all the wonderful benefits of this med. At 46yrs old, I hope to take it through menopause and beyond, it has done nothing but help me to be my best, possible self.

I didn't realize how much this med was working until I got off it about a month ago; I am now on Viibryd.  On Zoloft, I had fewer ""breakdowns"" and was all around a much nicer and calmer person.

It's hard to wean off of but I found that decreasing the dose very slowly helped. I could reduce to 50 mg with no problems and used that as my starting point. Then I would reduce the dosage by approximately 12.5 mg (by cutting the pills up) for each two-week stage. So it was 50 mg for 2 weeks, 37.5 mg for 2 weeks, 25 mg for 2 weeks,etc. I still had some dizziness but it wasn't quite as bad as when I followed the recommended protocol for weaning off!

I took one pill, a very low dosage maybe 10mg, during a stay in a hospital psychiatric ward back in 2006. Soon after I began having very intense visual hallucinations. My doctor was notified at once and the medication stopped. He informed me that it was a rare, but serious, side effect of Zoloft and to never take it again because long term the hallucinations may become permanent. It seems my body is incredibly sensitive to psychiatric meds, especially anti depressants, as I have always had severe reactions to them. Eventually, I learned to work through my depression and anxiety and PTSD without the use of meds(therapy only) and am much happier now.

It pulled straight through and out of a severe depression, but the drowsiness and effects it has on memory and concentration were I believe the cause of two very problematic things - first a car accident which if it weren't for the safety features of our vehicles, I and a family of 5 could have easily been killed.  Zoloft helped me through the storm of the insurance claims which could have easily spiralled me into suicidal depression...I had to get a new job to pay for the costs of the accidents and on my job due to the complaints of my new manager about my frequent mistakes and inability to remember important job procedures, I almost lost my new job, and unfortunately that is still a looming possibility.  I just think Zolofts side effects are now causing the types of problems that cause my depression, so I am going to switch to Wellbutrin and see if my situation improves.

The IBS has stopped and I was put on effexor and wellbutrin but that is not for everyone. See an expert for help in these medications.  It appears it was my dopamnine was a problem  not so much my seratonin.  Family doctors are not well versed in treating depression and the side effects  of these drugs.

Went back for my follow up, and didn't really see any significant improvements so he increased Zoloft to 100mg. Well the 100mg gave me the shakes in my hands really bad and it became unbearable, so I went back and he put me back on Zoloft 50mg then added 75mg Effexor XR. So far I am happy with this combination. I still get a couple of crying spells but not too bad. I noticed I am able to get through stressful situations and other things that would have previously had me through the roof with anxiety. You just have to find the right combination with your psych, it might take several meds to get your combo down but it can work if you give it a chance! :)

It did, however, help with my depression (my dad had just died and it helped me to stop crying 24/7 but the muscle ""tics"" were too severe to continue so I broke them in half and at 50 mg a day I still have the ""tics"" - they are just less noticeable.

I had depressiona and severe anxiety with panic attacks. I never had any side effects. It worked very well for me until now. I had a relapse where I was under so much stress that I have trouble remembering the last few months. This happen once before when I lost my mother to suddenly to cancer. The zoloft helped me regain my life. But I guess after long time taking, I have become immune to it even after upping 150 mg daily. I just started Effexor. Hope it helps.

I am a 22 year old female who went on zoloft to control my anxiety. i have had eating disorders in the past, and after graduating from college i hit a point when i realized i had never fully dealt with those issues and was in a panic about starting my life. i began seeing a therapist who prescribed me 50 mg of zoloft daily.
the results were terrible - but it was not until about 2 months on the drug that i finally realized what had been happening to me. i gained about 20 pounds in two months - not great for someone who has struggled with body image and whose source of anxiety is weight gain. i also felt extremely sluggish and had no energy. i could not stop my food cravings - i would eat, and eat, and had  no idea when i was full. finally i took myself off zoloft and with hard work lost the 20 pounds i had gained. i think part of this was an effort and part of htis was a NOTABLE decrease in my cravings and a regained ability to recognizing my body's signals. i also had increased energy.

i am now considering going on prozac as i still have a pretty severe case of anxiety - i know zoloft may work for some people but wanted to write this review in case it helps someone else in my situation."

I am much more social now.  I didn't realize it at the time but I was carrying a lot of stress and negayive thought paterns. This has all dissappeared as well as the depression. I have regained my ambtion to exercise and as a result have lost about 10 lbs. At the same time I started taking zoloft dr advised me to start taking 2000 iu of vitamin d which also seems to be very bennificial also. Just started taking a multi vitamin and have substantially reduced complex carbs in my diet. In summary I ended  my depression and anxiety by starting zoloft and eating a more healthy diet. I highly recommend.

I had been feeling ok most of the time, but having debilitating panic attacks at random.  I felt comfortable trying an SSRI because I had had very good experience with Paxil 14 years earlier.  

I started the zoloft (generic for it) at 12.5mg and increased by 12.5 once a week until I was at 50mg.  Each time I increased, the side effects (jitters, nausea, sleeplessness, agitation, dilated pupils) worsened.  My doctor convinced me to try a few weeks at 50mg.  The side effects continued, and while I didn't have as many overt panic attacks, I was in a constant state of anxiety and felt as though I was coming totally unglued emotionally and physically.  

I stopped taking it, going to 25mg for two nights, then 12.5 for one, then off completely.  I know that a slower taper is usually suggested, but my doctor (and I) wanted me off quickly by that point.  I had no trouble with withdrawal, which I assume (just my speculation, I may be wrong) was because my body had clearly never adjusted to being on it in the first place.  "

I noticed a positive difference within a week. It has a sedative effect, therefore has helped with my 'insomnia' that I have been battling for yrs. (I was probably depressed due to ongoing stressful issues for the past 10 yrs & did not realize it).Also am now taking Amytriptaline 10mgm @ bedtime if I need it.(this also helps with sleep).
I believe that it has lifted my mood (I felt tremendous sadness & hopelessness most days...& cried all the time).Zoloft (Sertraline) has helped me. I don't cry as
I did before, also have more energy to do everyday activities. Before the meds I did not feel like doing anything..could have stayed in my pj's all day..had no interest in anything. Now I have more energy & I am better equipped to deal with our high stress issues. My daughter has noticed a difference also. I do not like to be dependant on meds. but in my case, I feel it has been a dramatic change for the better. My doctor feels that I should stay on the Zoloft for 9 to 12 months...then we will discuss if I should stop. He suggested that I increase the dose, but I declined this for now because I feel better. I will also see a therapist. As for the weight..I have gained 3 lbs, too early to say I guess...but I think I get more enjoyment out of life now...I had lost my appetite before & had lost 4 lbs.As for my libido..it was not good before...now I believe I may be regaining some interest..probably too early to say.

I gained over 30 pounds in the 2 years that I took this drug, it helped with my OCD and depression/anxiety but made me yell a lot, I was always angry, had no sex drive and craved sugar ! I was taking a 150 mg dose. It's also rough on your stomach lining, and can cause you to feel the need to puke. When withdrawing from the meds you get virtigo for weeks on end, along with the brain zaps, crying, yelling and thoughts of killing yourself. As normal as this is for any other antidepressant , this should not be allowed in Canada.

610$Condition: Depression$12/6/2011 3:10:26 AM$Reviewer: tiredlady, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$3$"I started taking Zoloft when I was in high school and it worked very very well for me. I was feeling depressed but didn't know exactly what was wrong with me, I just knew that I was sleeping through EVERYTHING and was going through some hard times. I was on the medication for three years and it worked well, etc. 

I started taking the medication again after 4 years and there are some things about it that I do not remember from the first time around. The medication will give you very bad nausea if you do not take it regularly and with food so beware. However, this wore off for me after a few weeks. You also may have problems sleeping, but overall the reviews are very spot on. In just a couple of days you feel much better and have the motivation to not only stay on the medication but get other things done too! I'm not sleeping 24/7 anymore. However, also like the reviews I've experienced a lack of libido and in the past very very vivid dreams."

I am sleeping better, happier and easier to be around.  The one side effect I am having are the vivid dreams.  No big deal. I wish I would of started this a year ago when my doctor suggested it.  If it doesn't work for you then talk to your doctor and start something else, no one is making you take a drug that you don't want to be on.

I was prescribed Zoloft 5 years ago for panic disorder and never took it out of fear of side effects. I kept it in my closet and suffered for 2 years with anxiety and panic but never took it. In March of 2011, an event took place in my life that sent me back into panic mode. I went back to the doctor and was prescribed Zoloft again. This time the doc made me promise to try the med. I am here to tell you that it has worked as advertised in lowering anxiety. I have not experienced any severe side effects at all, only a couple of very insignificant ones such as slightly jittery hands. The stuff is good, or at least for me. Dont fear it. Trust your doctor! Also, you may feel a bit weird for the first few weeks. No big deal! Just wait that out and keep in communication with your doctor. I hope this review helps someone. Remember, if this med doesn't do the trick after a few months, there are other SSRI meds that can help. The whole trick is to find a doctor you trust and follow his or her instructions. When they tell you to stay on it for several weeks to see if it works for you they mean it! Don't think that after a week or two you know if it is working... stay the course!!

I have never woke up with wet sheets from sweating at nighttime, but I did when I first took Zoloft. I also felt very hyper at night, so it was hard to fall asleep. I started taking the pill in the morning with my breakfast;  This ended the sleep and bed-sweating problems. I did notice myself having extreme over happy moods mixed thoughout the day. I'm on my 2nd month of taking this medicine and I have never felt this good about life, my family, my past, my f'd up financial problems. I am diagnosed with major anxiety, depression, Post-tramatic stress disorder, Social anxiety, Manic aggressive behavior, extreme adult ADHD, and due to a head injury I have memory problems. Alot huh? I had been taking Alprazolam 2mg to help me control myself, but I would drop me off hard, when I didn't take it, or I forgot to take it, or if I took it too late. I used to often get asked ""did you take your crazy pill?"" ..It almost makes you feel retarded after you hear it so many times, and you realize you're being told this because you aren't acting rational. Maybe 2 weeks after Zoloft was added to my pharmacy :) ..I haven't heard that question. Now that the Medicine is fully working I feel good. Like, maybe this is what ""normal"" people feel/ think like? I thought I had been on, or tried every Medicine out and nothing worked ...or worked completely. I even got a job at Target and Ross wants to hire me too :) I definatly credit my medications for helping me. I had trouble interacting with strangers or I would feel like I was being stared at or that people were talking about me or watching me. Now I don't even notice and thoughts like those don't even cross my mind. This medicine is was hard to get used to, at first. Now that my body is used to it and seeing the ""old me"" -just a month ago! I am not even comparable, yet I still feel like me (just a sane version, that can think straight now) These are cheap med's. I can afford them w/o insurance. $30/mo."

It began to work with the very first dose and still prevents the chronic depression that has plagued me for the last 20 years. I take 100 mg each morning. Other than a significantly decreased libido, the only side effects that I am aware of was aggitation when I failed to take the medicine (Zoloft). I had much anxiety and the whizzes so I just got my prescription re-filled. My doctor has informed me that Viibryd might be just as effective as the Zoloft without the side effects that might happen with long term use of the Zoloft. I am very apprehensive about discontinuing a med that has worked so well?

654$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/19/2011 5:55:23 PM$Reviewer: kayosphere, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"In 2008, I was put through the ringer on multiple medications as my doctor and I searched and searched for appropriate treatments for my mood disorder. While my other medications quarantined the majority of my symptoms, including the most severe spikes in my moods and the worst outbursts of my impulsiveness, I was lingering in a generally unhappy and psychologically unstable depressive zone, and I was completely miserable. Five months ago, Zoloft was added to control the last bits of anxiety I was having at work. It completely removed paranoia, fear, anxiety, depression, and everything that comes along with those symptoms, and it made me feel more ""normal"" and confident than I have ever felt since I can remember in my 28 years. Within the last six months, I have been through a divorce, a bankruptcy, and I have lost my father to alcoholic liver disease. It was just two months after my divorce when my psychiatrist added Zoloft to my other medications. I have not taken an anti-anxiety pill since I've been on Zoloft, and I have never felt better. The mood swings I experienced after taking any sort of anti-anxiety drugs were far too severe, so it was simply better for me to avoid them and deal with the stability of the anxiety rather than the anxiety and the anger that accompanied it when I was ""coming down"" off of the drug. With the help of Zoloft, I have improved myself three-fold; I'm making leaps and bounds socially, professionally, personally, and financially, and it is completely amazing what a difference I see in myself because I have been able to accept the help others have offered me. I see the strength within myself to keep on going rather than curl into a ball and lock myself away into a deep dark hole. Everything is tolerable; life is much brighter. There are still sucky days, but I never have trouble being optimistic. I've seen hell, and I know I can conquer it."

It helps me feel less anxious and my sleep becomes very regular, however the reason that I quit taking it is because it makes me feel like a zombie emotionally and because of the sexual side effects. I would take it again if I became depressed, but it's not a drug that I could take long-term anymore; The side effects are not worth it. I have found that walking outdoors and writing in a journal works nearly as well on the depression, but doesn't work for my insomnia that much and does nothing for the social anxiety.

I hated myself because I could not control anxiety and irritability, despite years of psychotherapy, meditation, relaxation training, and despite the fact that I became a successful athlete and academician. I started taking Zoloft 20 years ago and felt better in one week. Daily headaches for one month were the only side-effect, and they gradually stopped. Have only missed medication three days in 20 years, taking 50 mg daily the entire time. I will take this medication every day until I die! I am a much better person because it has made me a gentleman who feels ""normal"" and capable of enjoying life in ways that I never thought possible. There also has been one unexpected bonus!! In addition to anger management, Zoloft has allowed me to control sexual responses much better so that my wife and I both are more satisfied. The bottom line?? I will never hide or apologize for the fact that I take this medicine. . . and I was not a ""bad"" or ""crazy"" person before I started it.  Just like some people need shots of insulin to control blood sugar, and other people need antihypertensive drugs to control their blood pressure, I simply need a little more serotonin in special parts of my brain in order to control my emotions. Zoloft does that perfectly."
671$Condition: Other$8/30/2011 8:04:45 PM$Reviewer: S.H., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$5$Used for anxiety. Generic brand. Started taking in January 2008. Low dose, fluctuating between 25 and 50 mg. It has been helpful for my anxiety. I noticed minorly diminished sex drive but not much difference. I think it actually improved because I could relax enough to enjoy myself more. First few days, dry mouth, but that passed. First few months, diminished appetite, and I got nice and skinny (even though I'd recently had a big baby) so I was really pleased. The whole time, I've had a difficult time crying on the occasions when I felt I needed to just get it out (death in family, etc.). It's like the tears just wouldn't come. It's kept me very level.... But now that I've been on it for a couple of years, I just keep gaining and gaining weight. My eating habits haven't changed, they may have improved slightly. I exercise the same or more. I've always been a healthy, thin person and never had a weight problem. Now I'm about 25 pounds over my ideal weight. I cannot say this drug is the reason for sure, since I understand a person's metabolism can change in their 30's and after childbirth. My doctor insists this drug, especially in a low dose, won't cause a weight gain. But I'm feeling frustrated and it just seems like too much of a coincidence. My anxiety is minor and the doctor says I can decide to stop if I'd like. This weight is causing anxiety too! Had anybody experienced this type of gradual, steady weight gain over a few years? Thank you.

Was successfully TREATED FOR 2-3 YRS during that time went up to 150mg from 50mg start.  Then NO MEDICAL INSUR and health clinic wouldn't prescribe BRAND had to pay $50/mth to get it SO COULDN'T and stopped cold turkey (DON'T REMEMBER ANY HORRIBLE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS though).  This time started with generic at 25mg for ANXIETY (more prominent currently).  GREAT SEDATIVE SIDE EFFECT of sleeping for 12 hrs a day EASED my ANXIETY (pain in chest, lump in throat, rapid heartbeat, nervousness, can't focus on anything to get it done) but made me tired when awake and forgetful for those 1st 2 weeks.  THE DOSE FOR TREATING DEPRESSION IS 50mg so now on BRAND for last 2 weeks and have HAD TERRIBLE UPPER BACK PAINS AND SPASMS; right after took dose nightly got great ANXIETY but it subsided after an hour; NAUSEA right after dose (2 TUMS helps); has REDUCED my GREAT APPETITE (usually overeating is due to an imbalance in brain chemistry) and I'm able to make healthier choices at regular mealtimes (REDUCTION in impulsivity OCD); does help me SLEEP DEEPER at night (need at least 8 hrs)  but is DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF BED in the morning (quick 1 cup of coffee and ready to go though); body PAINS I suffer from past injuries are EASED during the night which is a another welcome side effect not having to use additional meds.  I see alot of bad sexual side effects from other users reviews but I'm here to say, as it was years ago, there is some loss of normal sensitivity but ORGASMS ARE VERY INTENSE once you get there. I also remember great euphoria effect from serotonin (that's what I'm aiming for again) can't say that has kicked in yet but do feel relief and LIFE SEEMS LIVABLE for someone who has battled depression/anxiety/OCD since late teens."

I began taking only 12.5mg of Zoloft for PMS and mild depressive feelings. Initially, I had a little light sensitivity, gas and insomnia, but only a few days into the treatment, I felt brighter and began to sleep soundly. Three weeks ago, I increased to 18mg, taking it slow as I am very small built and sensitive. This drug has given me back the week of my life every month during which I had so little control over my emotions, I felt insane. I feel happier overall, I don't over-react to little things, I am calmer, less anxious and have a much more practical perspective on the little things that used to bother me. I still have 'feeling's' and am far from numb, just in control. I also feel more socially confident when out. Alcohol feels a little stronger than it did before taking the meds and I have more frequent bowel movements, but those things are a small price to pay for feeling so much brighter! I highly recommend trying this drug if you are wondering.

707$Condition: Panic Disorder$7/12/2011 12:37:42 AM$Reviewer: John, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken 200mg daily of Zoloft for three years to treat anxiety disorder. I tried many others before and nothing was as effective as Zoloft. My anxiety interfered significantly with my ability to carry out my usually stressful job and before Zoloft I would often leave work and walk furiously or even drive my car for miles until the anxiety subsided. Often I would resort to drinking a large amount of alcohol very quickly and sometimes this was mixed with Valium (usually 5mg X 2). Since taking Zoloft I have not had to use Valium once and my alcohol use has diminished significantly. The only negative I can think of is the possibility that my sex drive has diminished: that could well be caused by prostate issues which have recently been attanded to medically. However I am yet to recover full sexual drive. Perhaps I never will because of my age - 65. Having read a good many other reviews on this site I see that Zoloft does not suit everyone. It has though been of enormous benefit to me and for those it doesn't seem to work I just hope you find something that does: there is not much worse than severe anxiety/depression in my experience.

I began with 50 mg, 2 weeks, then 75 mg, next two weeks, then 100 mg next 2 weeks, then up to 100 mg twice daily. the first month, I couldn't sleep. I didn't sleep for 2 straight weeks when I first began. I finally began to sleep about 4-5 hrs a night when I took 15 mg Melatonin capsules OTC. My rest was not restful, though, as I'd wake up just about every hour on the hour. I gradually weaned myself from the Melatonin as I got closer to the 100 mg dosage. I've been on this medication for over 6 months now, and I can honestly say I don't exhibit near as much anxiety, worry, obsessiveness or compulsive tendencies like I used to. I'm able to interact with people in and outside of work much better. I am able to talk in front of groups again. I don't pick at myself if I get a zit, or continuously wash my hands or wipe down things before I touch them.
All in all, my anxiety and compulsions are 96& GONE! 
I'm confident this was the right choice for me."

I am wondering if this medication is adequate as I take 25 mg./day for 14 days, then none for the remainder of the month.  Also, I am wondering if I should supplement this medication with another mood-elevating medication?  Finally, I am wondering if endocrine testing should be performed on myself, given the intimate relationship between mood and hormonal balance, and, the fact that, the initial day of my monthly menstration is marked by extreme pain, cramping, nausea, and marked anger and resentment.

I have had depressed symptoms since my teen years and was first diagnosed with clinical depression at age 15, then at 17 I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I also have photosensitive epilepsy, which sometimes makes pretty down, so Zoloft helps that out. I think I've been on this medication now for about 4 or 5 years now. I have tried Celexa, Abilify, Remeron, and Effexor. Abilify made me go really quite well, psychotic and sick and Effexor stopped working after a while of being on it. Overall I feel much less depressed and irritable. I still get a little bit down here and there, but nothing like how I used to. 
727$Condition: Panic Disorder$6/14/2011 10:49:32 PM$Reviewer: SarahJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$I have had persistent, generalized anxiety for many years, but due to my fear and obsessions about medication I was unable to take anything to treat it.  About two years ago, my doctor prescribed .25 mg of xanax for me to take as needed for severe episodes, and that worked well, except that my kind of anxiety tends to be more chronic.  Waiting for the next full blown meltdown became a way of life for me, and one that I wanted to change.  I have had cognitive behavioral therapy in the past, but it was only mildly effective.  My doctor this year suggested I try Lexapro, which did not agree with me.  The start up side effects were just too strong:  increased anxiety and restlessness caused me to give up after only a few days.  Then a relative told me about Zoloft, so I asked to try it.  The first time my doctor prescribed it, I had side effects that I feared would be like the ones I'd had with Lexapro, so I stopped.  Then I started again.  Then stopped again.  But now I am on day 10, and although it was really hard to get on Zoloft, the side effects have diminished and I am starting to feel better at last.  My terrible, gnawing anxiety has lifted.  I feel calm and able to focus, not nervous and obsessive.  I take 50 mg a day, first thing each morning.  My sleep has improved, too.  I actually look forward to going to bed on time and getting a full, restful night's sleep.  I can honestly say that Zoloft seems to be working great for me, and I hope it will help others, too.  I finally know what it means to feel at peace.

W/out Zoloft, I am bitter, mouthy, verbally abusive, spiteful, emotional, mad, sad, angry, irritable, etc. to those around me.  Yes, Zoloft may put a damper on your sex drive, as it did for me for years, but now it doesn't seem to be a problem.  I still have bouts of depression, and sometimes I'm just wiped out.  After seeking help of at least 6 doctors, I was diagnosed with having a Bi-Polar D/O, Panic Attacks, Anxiety and Agoraphobia D/O.  I know I will be on Zoloft (and Depakote) for many years to come and I am totally fine w/that.  Regardless of the many people saying ""it's all in my head"" ""use something natural"" ""etc"". . . they are entitled to their opinion.  But as far as I am concerned, I know my body better than anyone - and - Zoloft is my life saver.  Without it, I would be in bed loosing days, weeks, months, years.  I would miss out on my children growing up.  I would miss out on LIFE, the one that my parents brought into this world.  So many people are on meds.  Don't ever be ashamed of being on meds, it is who we are.  Thank goodness for research and pharmaceutical companys.  You continue to help us survive everyday life."

I have been dealing with depression/anxiety/stress for 13 years since the death of my mother. I am an only child and always just very nervous/worried about my life in general, just unhappy. I was also sick with a virus when I began taking Zoloft, so I did feel bad from the sickness (the Dr thought I was sick from stress, but I am still recovering from a sore throat and still on antiobiotics and steriods too). I have been experiencing the jaw-clenching and waking up with my hair wet in the morning from having night sweats. I think I was talking in my sleep last night as if someone was in my apartment, but I live alone with my dog. I faintly remember having a conversation with someone, lol. Can someone will these side effects go away with further use? My teeth hurt from all of the jaw-clenching :( I so sleep better overall (I take Trazodone to help with sleep and this makes it work alot better because I was not sleeping very well with it before due to stress). I am overall happy with it so far, I just do not like the jaw-clenching and night sweats/talking. I don't want to end up sleepwalking or anything dangerous like that.

I finally went off birth control several months ago and after a few months was still having significant PMDD, so I finally submitted to being put on a Zoloft prescription. I took a low dose (50 mg) and it really helped me with anxiety and depression, cutting the days of the month that I was depressed down from 5-7 to maybe a half a day or one day.

The problem was, I gained a LOT of weight (25 pounds in six months), despite working out 5-6 times a week and eating relatively healthy.  There were no changes in my diet or exercise, the Zoloft was the only thing that could be causing it.  If it was just five or ten pounds I could handle it, but I increased exercise and cut down on food intake and I was still gaining, and my doctor told me that it is a commom side effect and it would probably be very difficult for me to lose the weight while still on the medication.

I'm now weaning off the Zoloft because I want to try managing the depression with vitamins (first try will be fish oil and a B-complex).  I don't mean to sound vain but the weight gain was making me depressed as well as uncomfortable in my clothes and my own skin!

I hope this is helpful for someone who is considering taking Zoloft for PMDD - I think it's worth exhausting other options before getting on it because of the weight gain.  But if I don't find the vitamins and supplements helping I will get back on it, I've had no other side effects from it besides some mild dizziness from time to time. "

I started off taking 50mg a day and now I am up to 200mg and just am starting to wean myself off and try a different medicine. This drug is very minimal at easing my anxiety and depression. I am normally a very unorganized person and I'm pretty lazy at times. This drug just makes me really lazy and exhausted. I tremble all the time even on beta blockers and have very little motivation to get anything done. The withdrawl symptoms aren't too bad but I can still notice them a little. The only good thing about this medicine I can find is that it didn't cause me to balloon out like Paxil and Lexapro have. Most of the people I know that have taken this drug have been really happy with it which is why I thought it would work for me but everyone is different. I would recommend it if you have mild depression or anxiety and gain weight easily but otherwise I think its awful.

To those who are experiencing suicidal thoughts, I highly suggest seeing a psychiatrist.  Drugs can't cure that alone.  Weight gain?  You need to exercise more and eat less.  The drug is not causing you to gain weight.

It worked at first, but then I felt it was starting to flat line, so my doctor increased my dose.  I started on 50 and now I'm on 150 mg.  I want to either stop taking it or switch to somethiing else.  Zoloft makes me have really BAD NIGHT SWEATS to a point where I have to change my clothes in the middle of the night because they are soaked with sweat and my doctor said there's nothing to help that. I also noticed a HUGE DECREASE in my sex drive. I hardly ever feel like having sex and when I do have sex, it either takes forever to climax, or I just don't climax at all.  I'm fed up with Zoloft.

I started on 50mg and have worked up to 150mg. It has taken almsot 5 weeks for me to finally feel a difference, but what a difference it is. There were days when I would stay in my sweats and just watch all tv all day. Now I'm finally feeling like myself waking up happy and wanting to actually do things again. It took a very long time to work for me, so be patient if you don't see antyhing right away. I'm glad I stuck with it. The only side effect for me is in the bedroom dept. Never been a problem before but having those ""fireworks"" now are near impossible or take FOREVER. But thats not the end of the world I guess. Otherwise I haven't had any other problems. I would like to move up to 200mg, but my doctor wants me to wait a bit. She kept telling me it takes time and I was starting to lose help, but finally I am feeling better. I would recommend this if you are thinking of tyring it. "
772$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/6/2011 8:03:54 PM$Reviewer: SC_84, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I've been on Zoloft on and off for 5+ years, starting it again when I was in the first trimester of pregnancy d/t major depression and paralyzing anxiety. No birth defects in my daughter! She is almost 2yrs old now and very happy nad healthy! I am as well! Taking this medication in conjuction with Lamictal has helped immensely to curb my drastic changes in mood.  I can effectively communicate my feelings and do so without becoming overwhelmed or hostile. I have noticed that taking a dosage as high as I do has serious side effects when combined with copius amounts of alcohol! It recently caused me to have a psychotic episode, landing me in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt.  I have since been sober and am letting the medication work to it's full potential. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and severe anxiety disorder which is managed with adderal and alprazolam. This mixture of medication is ideal for my conditions, only thing I've noticed is the decrease in sex drive, which I don't consider a bad thing, as I believe it was one of my addictions in the past. I'd much rather be healthy and happy than fall back into my old self-destructive ways! I do contribute my wellness to the medication and supportive people in my life. I have a reason to be here and I can clearly see that now! ;-)

777$Condition: Other$4/2/2011 9:53:47 PM$Reviewer: NH Mom of 2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have always suffered from menstrual triggered migraines.  But suddenly I was having daily headaches and eventually began to have almost daily feelings of lightheadedness (almost surreal feeling) to the point it was scary/difficult to drive.  My head always felt ""full"" and on overload.  This lasted a couple of months straight... so I finally visited the doctor.  After every possible blood test to ensure it was not my thyroid or other issue, the doctor suggested Zoloft (25 mg).  I was hesitant because I certainly was not feeling depressed, nor did I feel anxious or worried.  I had a promotion at work which had me working more hours and juggling kids/home more, but I didn't feel overly stressed... at least felt I was handling it.  Nevertheless, after 1 week on Zoloft the headaches and dizziness disappeared.  I began to feel much better, more like myself with a clearer head.  I had felt yucky for several weeks, it was such a relief!  After 2 weeks on Zoloft, I went off it.  Within 4 days, the headaches returned and each day I almost felt worse... my fear was I was gradually slipping back to how I felt previously.  The doctor suggested I continue taking Zoloft at only 12.5 mg. for a couple of months and wean myself off.  She said it is not uncommon for someone to need it for a few months, go off it and never need to take again.  I am hopeful I am in that category as I adamant that I want to be med-free if possible.  I have had no side effects.  As someone else posted on here, I think my sexual desire has INCREASED, likely because I am feeling better!  I hope sharing my experience helps you. "

I was off of meds for a couple of years and needed something.  Within the first 2 weeks I thought there was no way I was going to be able to take it, it made my anxiety/panic attacks worse. I would wake up out of a dead sleep with a panic attack. After the first 2 weeks I felt a calm and the medicine started working. I sometimes forget to take it, sometimes 2 days, and I notice a slight dizziness but nothing horrible.  I do think it makes me tired and I still have attacks every once in a while, but if I was not on this medicine I would not be able to leave my house.  For those of you that are just starting it, give it about a month to start working. It took about that long for me.

I hear electrical sparks in my brain, my vision is weird, eyes feel like I have saran wrap over them. I am photosensitive, can not be in the sun without burning like I am on fire, break out in a rash, itch and run a temperature. Two weeks of rash and itching, two weeks of shedding small flakes of skin, looks like I am molting. Leave dead skin all over the place. Keep telling the Dr. I want off Zoloft,but he thinks I should stay on it..I never felt depressed just trying to adjust to having cancer. If he will not take me off I will take myself off!

Since then, I have settled down, and I always feel better than any time before I started treatment.  I have not yet solved the problems that caused my depression, but I definitely feel more capable of dealing with them and moving forward and getting to a point where I no longer need the medication.  My wife tells me I am more connected, and more engaged with the world around me.  I believe that the depression had a greater negative impact on my sex drive than zoloft/sertraline.

His whole personality changed for the worse, his business failed, he became someone else and almost lost everything in his life. His doctor never asked anything more than how ya doing and kept rewriting the prescriptions. It was awful. He weaned himself off and we are back together and seeking therapy. The thing is, he couldn't see the changes in himself. He kept doing more and more risky behavior, including jumping out of airplanes and riding really fast on motorcycles. Just to 'feel' something. The same with the affair and prostitutes, it was more for the 'danger' and 'forbidden' feeling than anything else. It was a horrible 6 years and now he says he has a clarity he hasn't had in almost a decade. It scared the heck out of me that's for sure and our children still don't trust him after meeting his Mr. Hyde!

When my dr. finally called back, he claimed he had never heard of this problem but going off of it stopped the zapping immediately. Drug reaction is quite common in zoloft and patients should be aware of this potential serious side effect.

But I already feel a change. I'm pregnant with my second child and I just got overwhelmed with the thought of not having all my spare time with my son. He's 21/2 and hes my world plus a million other stressful thought. I was hiding my feelings fro my husband and crying everyday. I started on 25 mg with a follow up prescription of 50 mg after a wk. I'm not sure if it just hit my system after a wk or the higher dose did it but I got extremlyyyy drowsy.. just couldn't function wanted to fall asleep behind the wheel. But my crying fits and overall anxiety has seemed to level out so I'm kind of stuck. I saw someone write they took it at night because of the drowsiness so I'm going to try that. But rly I think it has helped a lot.. I hope it works out taking at night because I just feel myself again.

I'm still taking it but haven't changed my dosage in a very long time. I would recommend this to anyone that has depression or anxiety attacks! Just make sure you talk to your doctor & if need be.. go to counseling. Those 2 things really helped me through my hard times and I'm so happy I made the decision to do so.
813$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/23/2011 8:05:22 AM$Reviewer: stud4studosu, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$"This was the first psychiatric drug I had ever taken.  I used to have episodes of panic followed by immediate depression.  I have a family history of depression and anxiety, so my doctor put me on 25mg.  The depression and anxiety went away within a few weeks.  Unfortunately I had become socially, financially, and academically irresponsible.

It turns out that I was misdiagnosed and that I have bipolar disorder.  As far as depression and anxiety, Zoloft is effective.

I could not perform sexually to save my life.  I couldn't sleep at all, which made me tired the next day.  I think I may have eaten a bit more, but no noticeable weight gain.

I can't say Zoloft made me tired, because if I would have been able to fall asleep then I wouldn't have experienced fatigue the next day.

I would recommend treating or ruling out bipolar disorder before starting Zoloft or any other serotonin inhibitor (SSRIs, SNRIs)."

I don't cry for no reason anymore. However, I can't cry at all now! (Unless I'm in great pain). It hasn't helped with making me feel more motivated or less tired, though. And for anxiety attacks, Xanax is required. Zoloft doesn't help with that either.

I have been in counseling since I was 18 for depression and had tried prozac and wellbrutine, with no success, over 15 years ago. A month ago, my doctor had me start zoloft at 25mg.  I was exhausted for 2 days, but my anxiety attacks were slowing down. After a week, I went up to 50mg and began to sleep at night again. Problem was, I was groggy and tired all day; no energy. So, I switched to taking the 50 mg at night. The first 2 nights, I could not sleep. Now, I am sleeping at night , awake and happy during the day.

824$Condition: Depression$2/9/2011 12:22:38 AM$Reviewer: bandanna, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$In 1998 I started taking 100mg zoloft for depression after my son died violently, and started vomiting.  This was so severe, I couldn't hold down a sip of water or roll over in bed. My PCP sent me for more tests than I can remember. I was losing my mind.  The PCP, GI specialist & shrink said it couldn't be this drug. Even my gy/obn couldn't give me an answer. My stomach was distending. Why? No answer. I went on an out of town trip, ran out of my prescription, and within 3 days my symptoms of vomiting went from 15 to 5 times a day. This was 2000 or 2001.  It must have taken another 6 months before this side effect quit.  Research tells me the distention is one of the first signs of diabetes, which is rabid in my family. My doctor had my medical history. Research also said that children get diabetes due to excessive vomiting during a childhood illness!  So now I'm diabetic, more depressed because my remaining son died, will never take anything for depression and barely do anything a doctor tells me.  I wouldn't wish this on the devil. If I could star ratings would be in the negative.

I realized about 2 months later, that my anxiety had returned, and was worse. Rather than return to Paxil (lethargy and weight gain!!), I decide to try different meds for my condition.  I took Zoloft for 2 weeks to the point where I ended up in my doctor's office crying. I was so sick and anxious, I was prescribed Ativan to ""unwind"" the knots so I could sleep (did not sleep for 2 weeks).  I am drug free for now.  Effexor and Wellbutrin did the same thing, so it is probably my chemistry with certain drugs.  Unfortunately, you have to shop around alot to find the one that works, and the first two weeks can be killer for some of them. Paxil is not looking so bad after all, but I am game to try a few more, once I recover from this one! I am also trying counseling!"

Now...I feel as though I am taking nothing for the PTSD/depression/anxiety. Normally I take 100mg daily, but on those trying days I increase to 150mg. I don't feel any side effects from the drug (maybe sleepyness when I increase the dose). My situation is a bit unique because I have to be very careful what meds I take. I had allergic reaction to Paxil (hives) thus the Zoloft. I have CAD (5 stents), AVN in both hips (1 replacement), bridging Fibrosis in my liver (took Hep C treatment of Interferon/Rebetol for 1 year and in remisson. I have stayed with Zoloft because it is less harmful for my heart and liver then other SSRI's. Now I feel like it has a shelf life of 5 or so years that it REALLY works. While the last 7 years has been a general lacking of effectiveness. I understand that changing SSRI's can help but I am very iffy to make a change. I believe that I have about topped out the milligram amount that I can safety take.

Once I got through the initial side effects and the dosage was in the appropriate therapeutic range my depression vanished. I don't feel like a spaced-out zombie! I feel like myself-the way I always thought I should feel before severe clinical depression got in the way. No problem dealing with the weight gain-I am alive and functioning and that is way more important than worrying about my size. Now I exercise regularly and have made new friends! I encourage those suffering from depression to speak with an appropriate health care provider to investigate the possibility of taking anti-depressants. Sertraline doesn't work for everyone but with a little patience perhaps the right meds can be found. The difference it makes might be very pleasantly surprising!

I don't salivate for anything so its almost painful to try and eat anything other than yogurt or soft foods that go down easily. I took effexor some years ago and never experienced any side effects like this, but that drug made me crazy. Moodwise, this drug has helped keep me stable and stress free. I don't cry all the time any more and i no longer have suicidal thoughts. but will these side effects ever go away? the whole purpose of me taking this is to live a happier life so i can be productive and enjoy things again. the point is lost if all i ever want to do is sleep!

Started having issues with mood swings, crying constantly, weight gain, and extreme fatigue which is beginning to interfere with my daily activities and personal relationships. I have gained 45 lbs since starting sertraline (generic) and sleeping an abnormal amount. My body finds eight hours of sleep insufficient. Without an alarm I will sleep for fifteen hours, once I slept for twenty. Overall this drug did help for awhile, but I am switching to Wellbutrin SR today in hopes to fix some of my unresolved issues of fatigue, weight gain, joint pain, and depression.

Celexa(40-60 mg) did help me some, but I seemed to kind of plateu in my progress after 6-7 months.  Since starting on the Zoloft there is a noticeable difference in my mood and ability to focus and concentrate.  I should also note that I'm taking Wellbutrin in combination with the Zoloft as I was with the Celexa.  I have not noticed any side effects form the Zoloft yet and, in fact, some of what were apparently side effects of the Celexa (dry mouth, heavy sweating) have disappeared.  I know everyone's biochemistry is different, but so far so good with the Zoloft for me!

The only withdrawal symptoms I experienced were a slight headache with minimal dizziness. Nothing that stopped me from doing my daily routine. It seemed when I was on the medication, I was always tired, never wanting to do or go anywhere because I never felt good physically. 
I began not to care about my hygiene or anything else in my life. I also had to rely on ex-lax for constipation not to mention, my sex life had completely diminished. But I was happy mentally, or at least I thought I was. Since stopping, I have lost weight because I am now moving my bowels regularly. I also regained 'feeling' down there and am happy to report, I have no trouble reaching climax. What's bizarre beyond comprehension is that it seemed as though Zoloft made me numb from all that mattered in life. I wish I had the words to describe how truly happy I am now that I stopped. It's like the ole' happy me is back .. and better than ever.  I wonder how many others out there now, were just like me, feeling happy yet not realizing that the medication was having a terrible effect on day to day events.
Good luck to everyone  :)"

When I finally found a doctor that knew what he was doing he put me on an anti-dep., AM and PM, time released pain pills, and meds., for break through pain, we tried other parts of the puzzle but found this to work pretty well. I would give my right arm to not be in pain and not suffer from depression. Yes, the 2 go hand  in hand and I too have had people tell me it is in my head. Wrong. I now take Cymbalta and I love it.

It numbed any and all feelings, so I was unable to function as a ""normal"" human being. 
It ruined my digestive system's ability to manufacture Vitamin K and I would have very bad NOSE BLEEDS.
It has been 7 years since I took Zoloft and I am STILL HAVING SEVERE NOSE BLEEDS. I have to take supplements so that I don't bleed to death!
These depression medications DO NOT FIX THE PROBLEM THAT IS CAUSING THE DEPRESSION and the Doctor's don't care, just as long as they can make their money from doling out these deadly prescriptions.
A lot of depression is caused by OUR DIET and some is caused by something TEMPORARY in our living conditions.
We--as Human Beings--need to take more control of our bodies and for our own health. There is so much information out there to help us, if a person would just look it up on the internet.
I think it is WRONG to BLINDLY TRUST a DOCTOR just because he IS a DOCTOR. after all, he is HUMAN, and he may have graduated medical school at the BOTTOM of his class.  He also may not be keeping up with all the NEW research--I personally have had several Doctors who DID NOT.
When are WE THE PEOPLE going to wake up and realize that we are being"" LEGALLY""-  ""MADE ILL"" -AND- ""KILLED"" by Doctors and Hospitals?
 My advice--DO NOT CAUSE YOURSELF MORE PROBLEMS BY TAKING ZOLOFT OR ANY DRUGS FOR DEPRESSION.
Find a Doctor who actually wants to treat the CAUSE of
your problem!!  Think about it--they CANT GET RICH IF THEY CURE YOU---they get rich if they can KEEP YOU COMING BACK!  COMMON SENSE!!

It made me feel like myself again, and confident.  I went off it then had to go on it again after the birth of my second child (PPD).  Again, it worked great.  I again went off it after a year.  About 3 years ago due to life situations, I had a breakdown and had to go back on the Zoloft.  My main problem has been anxiety, not depression.  Zoloft has been amazing for me.  I no longer worry that my husband forgot to call me, or panic when my son is 5 minutes late from school.  I am fairly laid back now, and could not be happier.  
Depression does run in my family, and my Mom and sister have both also had success with it.  The only downsides are that it takes a long time to reach effectiveness.  It took about 6-8 weeks after beginning it to feel better especially this last time, which is an eternity when you feel like you are going crazy. Thank goodness from amazing family support I had.
The only side effect I had was dry mouth in the very beginning, and terrible night sweats.  I found that by switching from taking it in the morning to taking it at night made the night sweats go away- thank goodness.  I am currently on 100mg and plan on being on it indefinitely.  To all those researching, realize not all meds are for everyone, but don't give up before you give them a true chance.  Best of luck!"

Withdrawal has been bad. headaches, nausea,vomiting, shakes, numbess in my hands and feet, and dizzy spells that include a electric shock sensation going throughout my body. Dr said that I did the right way of weaning myself, and I will either have to go back on it or endure the withdrawal symptoms. Zoloft has also cause my to clench and grind my teeth, I have massive tooth decay, have already lost 2 teeth and am scheduled to have two more pulled and am being given caps in a few months.

My dr switched me to 100mgs because I didn't think Zoloft was as effective as it had been in the beginning. The 100mgs didn't make a different so I decided to go back down to 50mgs. Once I started this, I soon began experiencing dizzy symptoms, which I did not like. One day, I forgot to take my 50mgs, and then decided I just didn't want to be on Zoloft anymore period. After I stopped taking it, I experience the worse withdrawals. Everything from nausea, vomitting, and major dizziness. The first 2 weeks were the worse. It's been about 4 weeks now and I just just finally starting to feel a little more normal. Unfortunately, I now feel extremely impatient, angry, and irritated at EVERYTHING all the time.

This was the first time on any meds...I am not depressed, just tense.  I have been using 50 mg of Zoloft for 9-months.  Symptoms have been rare, except weight gain and sweating.  Today, I have started to wean myself off of Zoloft.  The sweating is too much.  My doctor wanted me to start Buspirone.  However, I am tired of weight gain and crazy sweating.  I hope I don't feel any withdraw symptoms.

I started taking it in high school because I was very shy and would become nervous in social situations. These symptoms eventually faded but whether that was due to the Zoloft, or simply growing up, I'm not sure. One thing I will say is that getting off of Zoloft is an all together unpleasant experience. In addition to the emotional changes that one might expect coming off of a drug like this, there are many 'adventures' that will be endured. The most significant of these are dizziness and something I can only describe as 'electric jolts' or whooshing feelings. Sometimes these feelings just take place within your head, other times they pass through the entire body. I'm stopping Zoloft because I want to have the opportunity to confront my fears, should I have any, on my own. Zoloft is a crutch that is necessary for some at certain times. However, all crutches are temporary and life is better lived deliberately.

With the Zoloft I experienced a lot of fatigue and abnormally dulled emotion. I also gained 30 lbs. during the three months I was on Zoloft (while exercising regularly and maintaining my already healthy eating habits), which is why I finally went off of it. It wasn't until I stopped taking Zoloft that I realized how detrimental it was to my overall well-being and how little it actually helped my depression. The weight gain and constant fatigue caused my self-confidence to plummet, and on top of that it didn't stop me from falling into intense periods of desolation. It's still a struggle for me to get through every day with moderate depression, but it's better without Zoloft.

Depression runs in my family. I have taken zoloft twice for depression in the last four years. (I do not suffer from anxiety attacks.) It has worked both times, though it takes awhile. The first few weeks it improves the quality of my sleep, and then it gradually lifts my mood until I am almost) my old cheery self. I am thankful for zoloft.  However, I have experienced some side effects:  first and foremost, diarrhea - which has slowed over time but still have some stomach irritation. (At one point the pharmacy switched generics and the diarrhea stopped completely.) Also, it has reduced my sex drive and ability to orgasm - my doc suggested I take a break from zoloft on the weekends and that has helped.(This could be a worse problem for younger couples with a more spontaneous sex life, but it works for us.) I have NOT experienced nausea, skin outbreaks, tremors. I am pleased with zoloft and feel fortunate that it has worked for me. It has helped my brother and my dad too. From reading the reviews, it seems that it is not as helpful for depression with anxiety. Also, I recommend patience when you first start taking it - it takes awhile to get the full benefit. I have recently added fish oil and aerobic exercise (Curves three days a week for 1/2 an hour) - and make sure I get as much light and sunshine as possible. It is important to socialize too - even if you have to force yourself. Good luck to all of you.

Bu I would rather be a bit hungry than to be tormented by my feelings and be secluded at home.

I do feel drowsy and dizzy at times, but I have only been on it for a month. I am happy to have found something that helps me be a better parent to my kids.

The zoloft made me uncontrollably trembly, shaky and twitchy, the tremors became almost violent at times when i got cold.   I had more nightmares than ever (especially of the rape incident) which made me terrified to sleep, but the medication made me sleepy so it forced me into nightmare.  I was very irritable and cried a lot.  The withdrawls from this medication were pretty hard to handle for me, if i had forgotten to take me medication, within a couple hours i would be completely disfunctional and irate, and the physical torture was almost unbearable.  My entire body would feel cold, it felt as if energy is being pulled out of my body, it's a hard feeling to describe,  my tremors would get far worse making my teeth chatter, i wanted to claw myself to stop the feeling in my body and it would make me cry from frustration of the physical symptons.  Zoloft also made me extremely edemic, it was almost like i had been in the hospital ""pumped full of fluids"".  I had retained so much water, if i used my finger to depress a part of my skin ie on my leg or arm, it would leave an impression and take 10 or 15 seconds to fill again, my body was literally like memory foam.  i gained a lot of weight.  This medication made me suicidal and irrational.  I ended up ingesting 80 zoloft and was hositalized for it.      "

think that I didn't need the medication any longer so I would stop taking it, and always my depression would return. So in the end as long as I  stay on the medication I remain in an optimistic attitude."

I take 100mg per day. This has been my miracle drug. I had severe PMDD i would go from laughing and joking to being mad at the world and then start crying for no reason and these mood swings would happen within a few seconds of each other. It was as if i was going crazy. It also helped with anxiety and the depression i was having at the time from losing my job. I felt like i was going to be miserable or crazy forever. It took about a month for me to feel the results and about 2 weeks for the nausea to go away. I no longer have PMDD symptoms, depression or anxiety.

1075$Condition: Depression$5/19/2010 10:09:32 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$Side effects lasted about a week and then were completely gone.  Worked great initially.  I became calm (no more flying off the handle) enjoyed my kids so much and they me and my social anxiety was mostly gone.  I stayed on it through my first 2 trimesters of pregnancy and went off for the last (had many panic attacks of feeling that I wasn't able to breathe, partly because of pregnancy and magnified by stopping Zoloft cold turkey.)  Went back on it 3 weeks after daughter was born but it just never worked as well as it did previously.  I eventually started feeling very foggy and started having short term memory problems.  Adding 5htp and tyrosine helped.  The big thing too my appetite started getting out of control... thought about food constantly and craved sweets all the time which caused me to gain 10 lbs.  Went off of 50 mg cold turkey.  Have been off of it about 2.5 months.  Has been tough and very on and off.  Started taking 5htp and tyrosine and starting to feel more leveled out.  I read that long term Zoloft use can affect your metabolism.  I'm hoping I can lose some weight and won't hesitate to try antidepressants again if I really need them (hope I can lose some weight first though..) Great at first, but long term can have a weight gain a foggy thinking effect. Eventually would probably have to be enhanced by Wellbutrin or Ambilify especially with the foggy thinking.

I have noticed that I am much happier, but that could be situational.  I continue to take it because I've had the fortunate benefit of weight loss.  However, the downfall is that my skin is much worse.  I'm not certain it's the drug and don't see that anyone else has cited an incrase in breakouts due to the drug, but my skin used to be clear until taking this.  I went off of it for about a month and did notice that I felt much grumpier, felt the weight coming back on and miraculously my skin cleared up to perfection.  I guess it's a tough call.

It worked well for helping my mood, but it strongly affected my desire to have sex. My depression worsened six months into treatment due to extreme psychological trauma. The doctor increased my dose to 50 mg. I experienced my first ever manic episode at 30 years old. My doctor ordered me to stop taking it immediately. Since then, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Specified). I have been free from psychiatric medication for three years. Unfortunately, a steroid used for treating H1N1 induced a brief manic period in me as well. No more Zoloft for me now but bipolar disorder for life. I don't blame the Zoloft, though. Even though I hadn't had any other mood episodes, BPD runs in my family. I think the Zoloft just helped it come to the surface.

I took 50 mg for two years with mild side effects, which included decreased interest in sex and feeling generally muted in my moods.  There highs and lows were less extreme.

My second experience, started three months ago.  It has caused fairly regular sleep disruption.  Initially I would jolt awake feeling very anxious.  I used sleep aids for close to 2 months to see if my body would adjust (lorazepam and temezapam).  I have since reduced my dose to 25 mg.  I will wake occassionally at night, but if I do I am much less anxious and able to fall back asleep pretty quickly.

Personally I feel this medication offers the best option for potential side effects.  I suffer from panic attacks and even on a relatively low dose I feel more confident that I won't have them while on zoloft.  I use lorazepam for panic attacks, when they do occur, or when I fly.

Each time I began the drug I felt really revved up.  I found myself grinding my teeth, feeling a little more irritable... generally amped.  Each time this subsided.   The sleep disruption has been a pain, and has led me to research other options.  But after reading reviews of other medications I feel pretty happy about zoloft.  "

I have gained 20lbs since I was moved up from 100mg to 200mg which has become a major concern for me. I workout and eat healthy but cannot loose the extra weight I have put on. I was hoping that the weight gain was due to the abilify that I started taking around the same time that my dosage was changed from 100 to 200mg. I have been off the abilify now for at least 4 months and absolutely no changes in my weight. I am going to try to lower my dose by 50mg and see if I then can begin to loose this weight. If it works then I guess I will request to be put back on the abilify and hope that it will make up for the 50mg decrease in the zoloft.

I've been on several different antidepressants since then and when my last one stopped working I took some time off from antidepressants (about 7 months). My OB/GYN suggested Zoloft because it is the safest one to take for pregnancy (I'm not pregnant yet, but have been trying). Well, I took it for 3 days - started on 25mg and on the 4th day I woke up have a severe panic attack that lasted all morning. I decided not to take my dose that day and later in the evening I started having dizzy spells and visual disturbances (twinkling stars and black spots) followed by a migraine. Needless to say, I will no longer be taking Zoloft. Also, it is no worse or better to take during pregnancy than any other of the antidepressants available; like most antidepressants it is riskier to take it during the last trimester...and knowing how bad the withdrawal symptoms are for this drug, I would not think this is a good drug to take during a pregnancy. I am experimenting with herbal supplements right now - I highly recommend wild oat extract (from Bach), a raw B-vitamin complex, and fish oil extract (high quality).

I was having severe anxiety and panic attacks for a long time after that horror. Zoloft/Sertraline has absolutely helped me to feel A LOT calmer, along with Counseling. 

I have not had any adverse side effects, and I HIGHLY recommend this to others.

A few important tips for new users though: -- It definitely increases your sensitivity to sunlight, and it can make you a bit drowsy.(I take my dose at night before I go to bed.)
- Also, be VERY careful if you drink alcohol. I would not recommend more than 2 12 oz. drinks (if even that much)
- Also, check with your Dr. about any potential interactions with vitamins, over-the-counter pain reliever meds., and herbal supplement

While it did help some, I must warn others about the bad side effects. Mainly, it effects the thyroid gland. I began losing my hair when I started it, feeling ill, and having joint pain. I went to the doctor and one of the tests they did was a thyroid blood screen which came back abnormal. I reduced my dose from 100mg to 25mg and was test again. It then came back normal. My theory is that the effect it had on the thyroid caused hair loss. Also, I gained weight, sexual side effects, and zombie like effect.

I have taken it ever since, with the exception of two periods, when I was misdiagnosed as being bi-polar.  For single-pole depression, Zoloft works for me.  I do not intend to change meds again.  However, the latest generic versions do NOT seem to be as effective.  Quality control is an issue, here, and I've had to double up on my dosage a few times.  Otherwise, Zoloft is MY SSRI.

My overall problem with this drug, and I warn others to be aware, is that it somehow affected my thyroid, among other things. I noticed my hair beginning to thin and fall out and I was having some joint and body pains. I remember when I first started on the drug I had this feeling of something in my throat (thyroid). Anyways, went to my doc and they ran some blood tests and found I had an abnormal thyroid blood screen. I reduced my dose to 25mg and my thyroid screen showed up normal. It can help, but it can also harm you as well. Wish we had a better way! Further, I did have some weight gain and sexual side effects.

Being a diabetic, I soon realized that the side effects may overcome me. Its been 15 years since I stopped taking it and my anxiety has peaked. My Doctor rxed Zoloft. COULD NOT STAND THE SIDE AFFECTS. More anxiety, sleeplessness, muscle tension/burning and frustration/loss of concentration.

I helped with those two things but turned me into a zombie. Further, it made me feel stupid, like I could not think. One big thing I think we should all be aware of is its physical effects on the body. I had weight gain, reduced libido, and hair loss (among other things). I went to my regular doctor complaining of hair loss, joint pain, and bone pain. One of the tests he did was a thyroid screen. While on 100mg of sentraline, the thyroid screen turned out to be abnormal. After reducing the dose to 25mg, the thyroid screen was normal. This med definitely has bad effects on the body.

Honestly, my verdict is still out. I was prescribed 50mg/day for stress and occasional anxiety, and it has helped. It has also helped with my mood. I'm known for having mood swings and being cranky without reason, and often without realizing it myself. The first week was difficult with the side effects (dry mouth, upset stomach, no sleep), but they've gotten better and in some cases changed completely (I am sleeping a lot now). My biggest complaint may be that of principle and fear. I don't like the idea that there is possibly something wrong with me and that I need a medication to fix it, and secondly, I worry if I will have to be on this forever. But with that aside, friends and family have noticed huge differences, I've noticed little things don't get under my skin as much, and yet I've still been able to maintain a personality, which I've heard some do not. So far, so good, but we'll see if this continues.

I've taken sertraline 100mg for 3 years now. I called my doctor's office after reaching a crisis point where social anxiety was severely limiting my life. It took the full 4 to 6 weeks to kick in. Then I slowly noticed the quality of my life improving month to month - even still. Weight gain? Yes. I decided I would rather exercise nearly every day and still have the extra pounds than be held back by anxiety. Dentist said I'm grinding my teeth. I have occasional night sweats. Libido is very diminished. Along with 2 years of weekly therapy I was able to vastly improve my life. Not perfect but much, much better. I didn't think that was ever going to be possible. At some point I would like to go off daily medication but I'm not there yet.

I have been on it for 6 years now and I encourage anyone taking Zoloft for the first time to give it a chance to work for you, take it every single day, at the time your doctor tells you take it,and tell him/her what you are experiencing while taking it. I felt restless taking at night,so my Dr. told me to take it in the A.M. instead of P.M and my nighttime restlessness stopped. I have tried many different types of medications for my disorder, and this is by far the only medication to completely fulfill its purpose. Good-luck, and don't give up!

I don't ever want to change meds again. Zoloft is not for everyone just like prozac wasn't for me it made me ill and mean if you Zoloft is right for you you will be able to tell i think within a month of being on it it was like night and day after i got to full strength dosage.

I thought it was post partum & the Gyno told me to take a yoga class to relax ~ could you imagine??? There was a positive major difference in my mood while on it. I was finally able to sleep through the night!!! I stopped them prior to getting pregnant with my second child for fear of what it would do to the fetus even though the doctors all told me it would be o.k. I have now been taking the generic form of Zoloft for about 2 years and would not have it any other way!!! I started taking 50 mg per day, then increased it to 75mg. There is a marked difference in the way I handle everyday life ~ much easier to cope. Life these days is not that easy ~ I have 2 children with ADHD & 1 of them also has severe anxiety. One is on Adderall, which is working wonderfully & the other is on Prozac ~ so far. Can't get him to take a non-stimulant ADHD med & the stimulants are are making his anxiety worse. My husband was also laid off 15 months ago!!! Has that for stress?? If it weren't for these pills I would go crazy for sure.
The only side effects are a little weight gain ~ doesn't matter I only weigh 125 now & I find I have a lack of desire in the sexual area ~ a drink helps that!!
For all of you that are living your lives in stress believe me it is not worth it. Try these meds & see the difference ~ the worst thing that can happen is you have to stop them. If you had high blood pressure or diabetes would you take medication for it? Stop thinking that you are crazy and get yourselves the medication that you need to function.....Good Luck"

I have always been told I needed to relax and have had issues with worrying and restless leg syndrome. Once I began having panic attacks regularly, at age 35, I went to my doctor (thinking I was dying..) and he prescribed generic Zoloft(Sertraline)50mg and Klonopin for occasional use and to help sleep. I experienced some mild side-effects such as dry mouth, constipation, ringing in ears and shakiness-but over the past 6 months they have gone away entirely. I still have to eat more fiber to be regular, and notice my tolerance for alcohol is down, but neither one of those is a negative! I am so glad I have this medicine and wish I would have done it years earlier. I am so much calmer now and am not overwhelmed by the horrible thoughts I was once plagued with. I sleep well and feel that for once in my life, my emotions are under control. Not a zombie-mind you, just more able to deal.

First I started at 50mg and had it increased to 75mg because of lingering depression symptons. I have to admit that I feel great since starting this medication. Im still not 100% but it's getting there. The only side effect that I've found is that I have crazy lucid dreams which I actually don't mind as long as they aren't scary but that is rare. This morning I actually woke up laughing because the dream I was having was funny. I only wish that the tablet came in 75mg dose instead of having me break a tablet in half every morning to get the extra 25 mg.

It does a great job in taking the edge off and it helps me control my anger. I had a bad temper and would get easily angered, notibly at home with my family(unfortunately for them). It has been very effective and my family cannot believe the change in ""Dad"". Nothing bothers me anymore to the point it used to. It's a shame I can't handle this without the use of this medicine but I can't. It took me a number of years to admit my problem and to finally get the treatment I needed.  I have not experienced any side effects thus far.
I do notice though, that about every 5-6 months I need to increase the dose by 25mg. I started at 25mg and am now up to 100mg. Not sure why this is the case but I'll do what I have to for my family."

1201$Condition: Depression$2/10/2010 11:37:39 PM$Reviewer: Ronsword, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I feel like the odd man out as most reviews of Zoloft seem to be very positive. I'm not knocking the drug, but have to report on my experiences with it; they were awful. About one week after treatment on 50mg, I started developing tremor and felt very agitated. The jitters were bad---feeling like I'd just drunk 5 cups of coffee. Side effects worsened and after 3 weeks, I experienced really bad anxiety, like nothing I'd ever experienced before. It was as if a part of my mind was spinning out of control and I was helpless to do anything about it. It was clearly a bad reaction to sertraline because I've never in my 53 years experienced that type of bizarre anxiety. I know full well what panic attacks are, and I've dealt with varying degrees of anxiety for decades. But this was completely new to me and scared the living hell out of me.  After switching to Celexa, my side effects almost immediately abated and my depression lifted within several weeks of therapy. So the moral of the story, obviously, is that everyone's brain receptors work differently, there is no test to determine the best drugs for those receptors, and so careful monitoring and switching of drugs when called for is the best and only course of action.

Zoloft saved my marriage.  Before I developed severe PMS, I would have never, ever considered taking any mood-altering medication.  I believed the common misperception about these being ""happy pills.""  After the birth of my first child and the return of my menstrual period, one week per month became pure hell.  I was snappish, rude, and angry-and I didn't even realize I was doing it.  I was desperate to be myself again.  After 6 months of misery, I decided to try Zoloft.  I started my prescription (50 mg per day) the day before my PMS week started.  There was a 36 hour time period where I felt a little sleepy and woozy, with mild stomach upset and dry mouth.  After that, I felt normal except for occasional dry mouth.  And my emotional PMS symptoms?  GONE!  Completely gone!  Even the physical symptoms abated.  I used to feel like I had the flu during the week before my period (body aches, extreme fatigue), but no more.  I don't feel anxious or on edge.  I don't feel ""giddy,"" either; I just feel normal.  So I'll be starting my Zoloft pills the day before my premenstrual week begins, and continuing them until my flow starts."

negative thoughts I use to have running continuously in my head. I don't think it has dulled my emotions. But, it has had a large negative effect on my sex drive. Hardly any desire though i am
over 70. I tried going without it for awhile but I started getting
the weird brain sensations from the lower Serotonin levels.
  Also the negative tapes started running again. 
So, the last 15 years have been much more enjoyable. I
would do it again.  The only thing comparable for me would
be Valium.
     But that's another story.

I was so consumed with anxiety I could hardly function. I was fearful of EVERYTHING. I began Zoloft over 1 year ago. For the 1st few days did 25mg, then to 50mg for a week, have been on 100mg ever since. The ONLY complaints I have are weight gain, and sexual side-effects. At the time those issues we SO worth it.  To be the person I have always known I am, but Anxiety (it was extreme) took from me some weight gain just didn't matter.  I have become a better spouse, mother, friend etc.  My OB/GYN has NO concerns with this drug and pregnancy.  He said it would actually be the drug of choice when not taking it would be more harmful. My regular M.D. doesn't feel the same way though.  I, however, have a very close friend you DID take it during pregnancy and breast feeding for a year after pregnancy and her child is healthy, intelligent and ornery as ever!
I am now starting BuSpar 2x daily and trying to cut down on Zoloft now that I am doing so much better and my doctor feels that depression isn't the issue for me, it's the anxiety.  The side effects are supposed to be much less.  We'll see how it goes. To anyone who is afraid of Zoloft, all you can do is research and trust your dr. It really did give me my life back!!!"

I now have a three year old and a nine month old baby and after I had my second I got a ton worst. I was highly emotional ( hormones, I know). I am also in school full time and I felt like I had taken to much on in my life. I was so stressed and it was interfering with my everyday life. I also obsess over little things. I obsess about school work. If I am not doing school work I am constantly thinking about it. Every time I would get in my car to drive I would constantly think about getting in car wrecks. It started to effect my ability to drive. I had taken Zoloft a few year before and it worked good, but I could only afford it for a short time. After talking with my dr. she agreed that I should get back on it and they offered a generic version that was less expensive. I have now been on it a little more than a month and it is amazing. I feel so much better and I am able to let things go now. My relationship with my husband has gotten a lot better as well. At first it made me sleepy a little nausaus but it soon went away. I have lost about 8 lbs on it, but I am also still losing baby weight and work out everyday. It definitely supresses my appetite. The only bad thing is that about 8 oclock at night its like the effects start wearing off and I am hungry. I have to control my urge to eat late at night. It has not decreased my sexual desire at all. If anything it has increased it. I guess because my husband and I aren't fighting as much and I am much happier. I love this medicine!

After a traumatic experience in 2006 I was to the point in my life where suicidial thoughts were scaring me. I started Zoloft and after 2 or 3 weeks I started to feel better. Started with 50mg then went to 100mg.I just recently went up tp 200mg. I never have had any side effects from Zoloft. No weight gain. This may sound strange.... I realized one night sitting there watching TV, I was laughing at a show. Mind you I never found much amusing. I thought to myself Oh my gosh I just LOL!It was then when I realized that I was going to be okay. So those of you wondering about Zoloft, it's a personal choice but one I'm happy I did :)

At first, this drug seemed like a miracle. I was happy, out-going and social (which is very unusal for me), I had energy, I felt great, slept well and started to gain some self-confidence. I became much more active and accomplished much more than usual. I thought I was doing great after about 2 years, thought I no longer needed it and quit cold turkey, which you SHOULD NOT do! I felt like I was rolling backwards down a never-ending hill for about 2 weeks, and had to stay still in bed with my eyes closed. I had terrible headaches and trembling.  I got back on it a few years later, after my depression became severe and I started crying uncontrollably and cutting myself frequently. I felt better after about a week, however my extreme irritability, anxiety, high-stress and feelings of being overwhelmed remained.  THIS DRUG COMPLETELY KILLS YOUR SEX DRIVE! I feel disgusted at the thought of sex and don't want to be touched. If my husband groped me, I cringed in disgust. Which is not like me at all. I am going to be switching to Prozac soon. I guess it lost its effectiveness over time?  Zoloft also worked great for mom for about 6 months, then it stopped working for her too. You can only go up to 200mgs, so you can only increase your dosage so much. Overall, I'm not very pleased with Zoloft, and would not recommend it, especially if you ever want to have sex and experience any level of intimacy again.

1339$Condition: Depression$11/9/2009 11:48:30 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I was diagnosed with recurrent major depressive disorder and PTSD four years ago.  The cocktail that saved my life included Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Klonopin.  After years of cognitive therapy and EMDR I remembered how enjoying life felt, returned to practicing law, and dropped down to Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I started sliding recently and needed to add another antidepressant, so I went with the generic form of Zoloft due to Cymbalta's cost.  I got what I paid for.  Yes, I can at least grit my teeth to keep the tears back till I get home now, but the veil/grayness is still there.  I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone with severe, major depression - it's not adequate for the task.  I lost two more months of my life to the wretched disease, depression waiting for relief that never came.  I'm transitioning back to Cymbalta - my happiness is worth the expense.

After starting on Zoloft for around 2 weeks at 50ml/day and working up to 150ml/day over a 2 month period, I can only say I've experienced the results I have prayed for over the last 10 years. I thought I would never find my way out of the darkness of my life until Zoloft.

It really helps me alot, I'm not nearly as ""jumpy"" and I've had less panic attacks and flashbacks. The only tough thing about Zoloft is remembering to take it every morning. If you are forgetful make sure you have a daily reminder to make sure you take it because if you dont it really messes with your moods day to day. But overall it has gotten me on a road back to the real me :) Thank you."

It took about 4-6 weeks to really start working but it has definitely been a huge help to me. The past 2-3 weeks my symptoms have started returning, but so is winter, which is probably a big factor in the return of my symptoms. My doctor increased my dose to 100mg and I'm hoping it will make a difference. The only side effect I have noticed is night sweats, which have gotten better with time, but they are not severe and certainly manageable. I have not had any nausea or intestinal issues.

The reasoning behind beginning this was that depression runs in my family and also due to my job changing as I began traveling and living on the road.  I know there are others out there with similar conditions.  I am impressed with the drug but do see it for what it is as a band-aid.  It helps but does not correct the real root problem.  Prior to taking this I had never taken anything on a regular basis. My way of dealing with depression was with exercise and being out doors.  Now once again I am in a more controlled work environment and home everyday.  Soon I will begin regular exercise and discontinue use of this drug.  It has served its purpose well but I do not want to be dependant on anything except for food, water and shelter.  Only drawbacks that I have noticed are if I miss a dose - irritability and some anger but not depression??

I get worse around my period, and almost can't function in late winter.  I actually feel like I know I am supposed to feel on this medicine. NORMAL!! Anxiety, depression, major PMS, anger.. GONE! My patience, and concentration is a lot better too.  I am on the lowest dose, but I'm a small person, also, my doc did a blood draw and I was slightly anemic and low on Vit D.  So I am taking supplements for that. That may be helping me feel better too.  I had side effects the first few weeks, but nothing that wasn't tolerable.  BTW, I did go off this last year cuz I was feeling so much better, but when winter came, all the bad stuff came back and never went away.  I'll stay on it a little longer this time and hopefully get off and stay happy and normal... one day...

Been taking it for about 3 months and have had maybe 6 really bad days with nonstop crying I couldn't control, increased anxiety, extreme anger and irritability. Had to leave work once because I freaked out, couldn't stop crying, couldn't stop having really negative thoughts, I was angry, would have spat fire at people if I could, and had an urge so strong to hurt myself that I was afraid to be alone. It happened out of the blue and I still don't know why, maybe hormonal. Most days are good though. I was really weary about medicating for depression but most days it really helps. I have had an increase in appetite that led to some weight gain, a little trouble sleeping and now my dreams are so intense, and real that a lot of times after awaking from 8+ hours of sleep, I don't feel rested at all.

I remember the first day I took one, I was sooo nervous of how it would make me feel or how I would react to it, so I took it at work just in case I went looney ppl were around to help...lol Well days later I went from a 5 being anxious/having panic attacks down to a 1 or a 2 as far as not feeling anxious/having panic attacks. Its like I went from wacko to SO calm that I didnt care about much. I wasnt happy and I wasnt sad, I was just their.  Well I slept, and slept every time I had a chance.  I could of slept all night and the entire next day. I also have gained 50 lbs in 5 years being on it. All thoes years I didnt care that I was getting fat and that I was sleeping my life away as long as I wasnt having panic attacks.  Well, im 37 weigh way over 200 lbs and I dont want my kids memmorie of me as always sleeping and bing a 'fat' mom. I had a Drs appt yesterday and we (I) decided to get off the Zoloft and try somthing else.  She perscribed Celexa.  I pray to the good Lord that it works on my panic/anxiety and that I start loosing weight.  Im SO looking foward to having my energy back and wanting to do things besides sleep...
Positives for me were: worked excellent on my panic/anxiety
Nrgatives for me: TIRED, didnt care about much, didnt care I was getting fat, pretty much felt like a FAT zombie for 5 years! As long as I wasnt having panic attacks that is all I cared about.
Its time for a change. Good luck to everyone out in cyber world that suffers w/ panic attacks, they are awful. I pray for a good, happy and healthy life for everyone!"

It worked great in the beginning; however, it by far has the worst side effects such as weight gain, fatigue, loss of sexual interest.  I did take this while I was pregnant and my son who is 15 months old shows NO signs of any birth defects and/or side effects.  I am told it is one of the safest drugs to take during pregnancy.  I have recently been weaned off of Zoloft and switched to Wellbutrin - the withdrawal is a horrible process.  It was very hard to go thru withdrawl, work 40 hour work weeks and come home and be a mom and wife.  It lasted about 2-3 weeks and the withdrawl effects are severe anxiety, vertigo, severe mood swings and fatigue.  If you're considering this medication, seriously read up on it before taking it.  It does what its supposed to do, but are the side effects really worth it??

I am currently on 100mg in the morning plus clanezapam at .25mg in the morning and afternoon.  My depression kicked in the summer of 2008 when I moved to a new home and started a high stress job that I did not choose.  On top of that I was diagnosed with a heart condition that will most likely result in a valve replacement surgery down the road. I also went through about 2-3 months of therapy.  I am a totally different person today.  I was never socially active and I was having frequent panic attacks.  It is strange when you look back at it how you are in a deep hole and you fear that you will never get your life back.  I have gotten my life back with the help of Zoloft.  I highly recommend it to anyone suffering the same issues. You have to have faith and belief that you will overcome your depression.  It was hard at first getting out to do normal everyday things.  I forced myself to get out and do chores outside and my family was a great help.  I did try other drugs at first and Zoloft was my life saver. I plan an taking the rest of my life because I never want to be the person I was before, always anxious and never wanting to be around other people.

I took 100mg of Zoloft for seven years and for the most part felt great. The only side affect for me was how my doctor put it ""I couldn't get mt ticket punched during sex"". This simply would not do for me. Coming off the drug is difficult but can be done. Just ween yourself each week you are taking it to smaller doses by cutting the pills. You will get an strong feeling of dizziness and disorientation but it does pass within a short time. Maybe 2 weeks or so. Once u get past that point u will be fine. I now take Wellbutrin which does everything the Zoloft did minus the sexual side affect. Good luck people and if u want off this drug it isn't easy but it can be done. Just hang in there. I'm really proud of everyone who are taking steps to make their life happy and fulfilling for them and their family.

Oh one other thing...If u decide to switch drugs from one that isn't working for you to another you and your doctor want to try, it was my experience to ween yourself off the first drug a little before starting the new one. I told my doctor about my side affects with Zoloft and he immediately wanted me to start Celexa without getting some of the Zoloft about of my system....HUGE MISTAKE...don't do this...Cut your Zoloft dosage down to almost nothing then start the new one. When he had me just switch from one to the other within a day that really screwed me up. Just a word of advice.

I have to say that this medicine does work , I stopped taking it for a week and a half without my doctor's permission and I started to experience the Panic Attacks again. I am currently taking 75 mg , but I was told it needs to be increased since I am having a hard time . I restarted Zoloft on September 16, 2009 and by the concentration levels going low in my blood stream I have to wait for the 3-4 weeks for some relief. I am an adult college student with four children one which is a toddler and I need all the help I can get in dealing with my childhood or the lack of it. Zoloft can also be taken with an antihistamine to help keep you calm if your taking any Xanax or Ativan. I popped 3-4 tablets every 4 hours of the Benadryl . I won't see my physician until September 30, 2009 and I will ask her about increasing the Zoloft and taking some Xanax as well just until the Zoloft kicks in for the full effect. Please note that anything you may be feeling rather it be Anxious thoughts or Depression you are not alone and there are people who can help you with this. When my attacks get so severe and out of control I do some Deep Breathing and Visualization I am also going to attend Cognitive Behavior Therapy once again. Don't give up YOU ARE NOT ALONE . Seek help if your confused and disoriented while having an attack. Life is stressful but it can also be Pleasurable . Take Care I hope this helps anyone. Peace:).

1412$Condition: Depression$9/24/2009 6:48:43 PM$Reviewer: oldthymegal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been taking Zoloft for 16 years for severe clinical depression, which runs in my family. I was actually contemplating suicide because of my inability to cope with some difficult circumstances. Zoloft literally saved my life. I take 200 mg every evening and do experience some sedation with it, also have had weight gain. But overall, I have had excellent results with this medicine.  Have tried generics - some work pretty well, some don't. They all have different ""fillers"" in them, and some pharmacies (especially the big mail-order one) do tend to buy the cheapest ones. I got one (made by Cobalt out of Canada) that I was actually allergic to.  It also had absolutely no effect as far as controlling my depression - I cried for 2 weeks on it - went back to brand Zoloft and was better in 2 days.  So if you have to take generic for insurance reasons be sure you get it from a reputable pharmacy and ask them what generics they use(there are lots for Zoloft).  When you find one that works for you, ask your doctor to always specify that particular generic when he writes your prescription. Best advice is to get a generic from a US company, as quality control standards are monitored better here. My experience has been that brand Zoloft is best,and it's worth the additional cost if you can manage it.

1416$Condition: Depression$9/21/2009 11:39:30 PM$Reviewer: seankonnery, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I started with 50 and now up to 150 mg. I plan to go up to the max of 200.I had suffered from depression and anxiety for over 8 years until I discovered this drug! This is the first time I have had any relief from my condition. There were side effects the first two weeks but mostly gone now. I still clench my teeth now and then. One side effect is good for our sex life: I am not as anxious about missing sex, and I don't have pre-mature ejaculation at all. Overall my drive has decreased, which is a good thing, really. I could be quite overwhelming at times. I was heavily addicted to pot from 14-32 yrs old. This drug has a little similarity which makes it easy for me to know how to use it to gain peace of mind and calmness without getting bothered my the spaced-out feeling I get from it sometimes. It's a hell of a lot better than yelling at my kids, wife, and being nervous about everything, guilt feelings, etc. I still am pulling hair out of my head, literally, and very disturbed about disappointments in my life right now, which is why I'm going to the max 200mg in about 2 weeks time. But my life is a VAST improvement with this drug. Thank G-d and my nurse practitioner!

Second time, felt GREAT. Amazing. Like nature had made a mistake, and then it was corrected with more serotonin in the brain. No anxiety, no panic attacks (though the day was filled with them, when I took it at night, felt amazing and the tables instantly turned!)Felt like this is what I should have been feeling all along, except I could not. I didn't care about anything. I was happy, cheerful and relaxed. I wasn't desperate or needy, afraid to be alone, or afraid to be abandoned as I usually am. I simply don't care! It's like the rational part of me has gotten rid of that emotional filter...scary because I don't want to be dependent on it, at the same time, exhilirating that there is at least, a daily cure for the mistake nature made.

I experienced no side effects going onto the medicine, and in addition to helping me with my social anxiety disorder, it made my mood better, as well. However, after a few months, I wasn't really sure if it was still working, so my doctor recommended increasing the dosage from 50 to 100 mg. Bad idea. It worked okay for about a month or so, then I began to notice significant withdrawal effects (mostly increased anxiety and a racing heart, the same symptoms I've had with all 6 of the anxiety meds I've tried) when it came time for my daily dosage. It eventually got to the point where I was taking 150 mg's, and the effect would only last for 3 hours before wearing off. Bottom line: the higher the dosage, the quicker it will wear off.

Most people who experience the onset of such symptoms may do so mildly, and as the body becomes acclimated, such symptoms may resolve entirely, but it is important for potential users to understand that the first few weeks to months of treatment can force one into a very foreign and unpredictable emotional space that can at least transiently exacerbate the disorder for which the medication was prescribed.  What are the implications of this rough break-in period?  No one knows for sure -- some speculate it is a marker for an intractable withdrawal syndrome to come, others argue that such toxic responses can often signify a future intensification of anxiety or depression, and others merely cross their fingers while savoring whatever favorable emotive tides wash upon them in the short term.  I'm in the latter category. "

1502$Condition: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder$8/7/2009 6:31:19 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$4$"I was on this drug for several years for OCD, and while I was on it in the beginning, I was okay. During this drug I was put on Risperdal (do not have Bi-polar it was a misdiagnoses by doctor) however, due to the risperdal and Zoloft I gained 100 + pounds in six months and I could not lose. Once I got off the risperdal I still could not lose weight with Zoloft, and I just stopped taking it and lost 5 pounds in about a week so Zoloft affected me with weight issues. Also, the reason I got off Zoloft was, I took it because OCD and thanks to the Zoloft I became clinically depressed with thoughts or suicide (so much for Zoloft trying to treat depression when it gave it too me with no depressive thoughts before). 
Now with withdrawals, I have become irritable, crying constantly, constantly feeling ill with head aches nausea and fidgeting, my sleep habits are insane now I can go all day without even being tired and stay up all night some days and sometimes, I can sleep for more than 13 hours and still feel exhausted. 
Overall, pill at first was good, helped with my OCD but then caused depression, also affected weight and now I have thyroid problems, and withdrawal symptoms are terrible, even with the doctors advise on how to ween off of it. I would not recommend this to anyone because even if it works if you ever want to be taken of this drug, the withdrawal symptoms are worse than anything I have experienced. "

1512$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/30/2009 9:54:28 PM$Reviewer: Mateo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$3$"Having dealt with Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and OCD for the last 10 years -- Zoloft has helped me immensely.  In my experience it starts to alleviate symptoms w/in 1-2 weeks, but finding the correct dosage is critical; too high of a dose tended to promote mania for me.

First, I tried Paxil for 1 1/2 years but my experience with it at 10-40mg was that Paxil, although effective, made me feel “mentally numb.""
 
A switch to Zoloft proved to better treat my symptoms without the “numbness.” But I was still symptomatic for 2 years while taking only 100mg.  After an increase to 150mg I felt much better, but had to watch out for manic episodes.  

Side effects: these are well documented.  Starting, stopping, increasing/decreasing brings on: ""electric shock"" sensations in arms and legs, waking up frequently at night, clenching one's jaw while sleeping, and disturbing lucid dreams.  At times I felt I was losing my mind, especially when I abruptly stopped taking the medication.  It has been my experience that these side effects abate w/in 2 weeks.

Also to note: for anxiety and mania, caffeine is the devil!!  Switching to decaf was essential to my progress.  Even just one cup o' joe would launch me into major anxiety and/or mania for days.  I can't stress enough how critical this was for me.

Sexual side effects: yeah, they’re a problem.  My gf told me I “needed to have a long talk with Mr. Wiener.”  We broke up.  It helps to have a girlfriend who is supportive, not selfish, about your progress.

In conclusion, including Zoloft as a part of my therapy has opened doors for me that have been shut for years.  After a stressful six-year military career, and having up and quit seven jobs since, failing in semester after semester of college, surviving a school shooting, and a tragic end to a 2-year relationship, I was suicidal every day.  Taking Zoloft helped me overcome my symptoms for Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and OCD, and helped me get back living again.

I wonder if my body now wants the higher dosage although I really don't want to go that route.  Puzzling, so I am going to the doc tomorrow to discuss.

The medication does not make you feel better rather it simply deprives you of emotion.  I was no longer as anxious but I hardly felt happy about anything.  My doctor moved me up to a 100mg dose after 4 months and this was terrible.  I began sweating uncontrollably, dry mouth worsened, appetite was non existent, and I had prolonged ejaculation.  The drug will ruin your libido and leave you feeling more insecure then when you started taking it.  Avoid high doses, side effects were very present.

About 4 months before I even went to my doctor I started having anxiety problems. I first noticed that I was having trouble sleeping, and experienced lots of anxiety (especially at work). I even had a couple of instances where I almost passed out from panic attacks! By the time I went to my doctor I was so jittery and upset that I couldn't even speak because I couldn't stop crying. My doctor prescribed Zoloft for me, and he also prescribed Xanax. For the first month or so I used to take them BOTH everyday, but I just couldn't stand the way Xanax taste. I stopped taking that Xanax, but I still take Zoloft everyday. I've noticed that i've gained between 10-15lbs, and I don't have as much energy as I used to. This medication seems to be working very well for me. However, I did forget to take it for a couple of days and I wound up having a major anxiety induced freak out.

But the weight gain is very counter-productive, the last ting you need with Depression is more negitive feelings (unwanted extra weight). Side effects list 'loss of appetite' but I see from all the patient reviews weight gain is a common factor. This needs to be addressed, like I said compounding a depression is a harmful situation.

Ask yourself: Do you also care how you are peceived by others while on it?  

I have been on several SSRI's (Prozac, Paxil, Effexor) myself.  My wife was placed on Zoloft.  She seemed to have been very happy with it (the subjective experience).  Unfortunately it completely changed her personality.  An intelligent, warm, accomplished woman before, on Zoloft she became narcicistic (even self-worshipping), unsympathetic, and cold.  And she was happy with her new self.  Professional colleagues commented on her personality change, not just me (her husband).

Her internal experience was/is a ""positive"" one for her -- I guess.  Yet I feel sorry for her -- because her reality is...well, not ""real"", as in the outside world.

My warning: I am very leary of this medication as a result of how it changed my wife -- and there are plenty of other SSRI drugs out there to choose from.  Personally, I'd avoid it like the plague."

Took effeoxor xr for 4 years, that helped a lot more but was a horrible drug as it has detox symptoms very similar to a heroin detox. Zoloft doesn't give me any side effects. I too get really angry at times but who knows what that is from...webmd just emailed an article stating that the asthma drug Singulair is causing severe anger outbursts...lol. So who knows. Overall I dislike Zoloft. I am going to try to get off it and try something else.

Instead of it making my mood swings, depression and anger subside, it has made me completely emotionless. Almost to the point of numb and apathetic in regards to everything. Though after 2 years, I am seeing the need to wean off of it, when I do try to skip a few days without taking it, my hands tingle, almost as if I'm holding a metal tuning fork? or have been running a weedeater for extended time. I get dizzy spells and can't remember things anywhere near like I used to. Had I known the consequences, I would not have started taking this medicine.

The first couple of days on Setraline I felt spacey and tired and seemingly no emotion.  That did even out, and started working immediately for stopping attacks!! I am taking 25mg and do not know if I will up it yet.  
Side effects I currently am going through is dry mouth, had a few headaches but primarily more sleepy than normal.  Also noticed I seem to be gaining a little weight, I hope that this will even out as well.

I stopped Zoloft for about a year in 2003. At this point, I weaned off of 75mgs over the course of a month. I experienced all the typical withdrawal symptoms (both verified and unverified by the drug companies). These included “brain zaps”, faintness, nausea, severe rage/aggression (almost violent), crying fits, etc…  The withdrawal symptoms went away after about six months. I noticed that my compulsion to drink alcohol went away (and therefore the weight that I had gained), as did the zombie feeling. I had been on this for so long that I thought it was all normal! I actually started to feel things again, sans “Garden State”. I actually wanted to experience life. 
Unfortunately, I had to start taking it again within a year due to unexpected hardships. Within weeks of taking Zoloft again, the zombie like existence returned, as did the compulsion to drink, weight gain, etc. At this point, I realized for the first time that it was the drug that made me feel this way (crazy how it distorts your thinking). 
 I stayed on Zoloft for another six years because I was terrified of the withdrawal, and what it would do to my job and personal life if I tried to stop again.
I finally stopped taking Zoloft again about a month ago. I suppose being laid off is as good at time as any to kick a bad habit. ? I followed the same process for weaning of it. I had the exact same symptoms as the last time; “brain zaps”, faintness, nausea, severe aggression (almost violent), crying fits, etc. I’ve been off it for two months now, and I still have all the withdrawal symptoms. I don’t, however, have the “zombified” feeling, compulsion to drink alcohol, negative sexual side effects, or lack of interest in daily activities that used to accompany Zoloft for the last 15 years.

My overall mood is just better. I do have to take it in the evening with my dinner, couldn't take it in the am, just made me way too tired!!!  but nighttime does the trick. It took 3 weeks to get over some side effects, so just stick with it, it does work!!! and the side effects will go away. Just give it time and keep your starting dose as low as possible. I still have a few side effects just vivid dreams is the most dramatic.  No weight gain at all, being a nurse I do see that once patients start to feel better on any medication, the first thing people usually do is gain weight, so make sure you are not consumed by the thought of maybe gaining weight.  I am very happy I have started Zoloft and hope everyone else get the same results I have, I feel 100% better!!!!!  Great for PMS!!!!!

Three years ago I developed symptoms of depression. I couldn't concentrate. My mind would race with multiple thoughts at once, and I was always fearing the worst. I was put on zoloft and started feeling normal again. 
      About six months ago I stopped taking Zoloft because ""I felt fine"". BIG MISTAKE. Over the next few months my symptoms returned worse than before. I was barely functional. I have been back on Zoloft for six weeks now and it's starting to work again. Thank goodness.These symptoms seem to effect the male members of the family on my father's side and they always develop around the age of forty. I had always hoped I would be spared. I was not. Thanks to Zoloft, I can lead a fairly normal life."

The first time I had one, I went to the emergency room because I didn't know what it was.  The follow up visit to my doctor was enlightening for me.  He prescribed zoloft for me then.  It took a while for the medication to build up in my system, so it took a while for it to become fully effective.  But, I've been using it for several months now and it works great.  It has also helped with my moodiness and irritabililty.  And I haven't had any panic attacks (knock on wood) for quite a while now.  Yeah!

1672$Condition: Depression$5/1/2009 12:00:27 AM$Reviewer: gigi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$This drug totally worked for my depression and pmdd. The only awful thing was that I could not orgasm no matter how hard we tried. That really put a strain in that department so I went off of it just for that. (I was on a 25mg dose) So now that depression has come once again, I decieded to look into natural methods. I would suggest looking up information on supplements such as SAM-e, 5-htp, and L-tyrosine.  Almost all of the reviews on line have been positive, with NO side effects. I've been taking the SAM-e and after about 8 days worked just as good as the Zoloft with NO side effects.  I just got the other two and will start slowly with them as well.  Best part is they are all nattural!! I would for sure talk to your doctor before starting them and you should always wien off slowly from zoloft and under doctor supervision.  And I only recommed this for mild cases of depreession. Im no doctor, just putting it out there for those of you who are sick of the side effects.  worth a try.

Although I did seem to feel a sense of ""longing"" or desire (not sexual) which normal folk seem to take for granted.  Before on this, one of the only things daily that offered comfort was singing.  Zoloft made me not want to sing anymore...maybe though cause I usually sing to the same album every night lol (ocd?).  This could have been somewhat of a positive though in terms of OCD, i got tired of the things i was doing on a daily routine for the past couple years which i would normally call my ""comfort zone.""

I than started on Zoloft and the first 3 weeks I had some side effects like nausea, lite headaches, and lost of appetite. I also started going for walks and doing my breathing techniques  as I walked. That helped my panic attacks tremedously. I only take 25mg and I am going to start winging off it soon.

Started with post partum depression. Every time I try to quit I feel like I'm going to lose my mind- either break down & cry or rip someone's head off. The mood swings are aboslutely horrendous when trying to get off it. I give up trying to quit and start taking my regular dose again. Absolutely no sex drive. Could care less if I ever have it again. Grinding teeth is one side effect that has cost me a lot in dental work due to cracked & chipped teeth. I've noticed the numbness in my hands but never related it to the drug. Guess I didn't know it was a side effect. I feel great when taking it. It definitely worked with the depression. Now the hard part is trying to get off it.

I switched from Paxil to Zoloft because I was pregnant.  I did lose my baby at 12 weeks and am still unsure if it was due to the Paxil or not.  Anyway, I take Zoloft for anxiety and very mild OCD.  The drug helped with anxiety but did not really help with the OCD.  I have recently (past 3 weeks) cut my dose in 1/2.  The only withdrawal symptoms I have had from cutting my dose in 1/2 are headaches.  I never really had sexual side effects while on Zoloft or Paxil.  Zoloft does make me a little more sleepy than usual but nothing I cannot handle.

About 1 year ago I was forced into a new position at work and my anxiety increased and along with it, panic attacks.  I did nothing for about 7 months (which I now regret) and was then diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks.  I took buspar which did not work. I then went into a deep depresion and I was started on Zoloft and Clonazepam (.25mg in the morning and the afternoon and .50mg before bed).  It took about 6-8 weeks to get back to normal and my anxiety is not as bad and my depression is gone.  It was frustrating at first because I wanted everything to change overnight.  If you stick with it and be active even if you don't feel like it, you will overcome your depression and things will be good again.  I am currently on 100mg of Zoloft and will continue for 6-12 months according to my psychiatrist.  I am also seeing a therapist to learn non drug therapies to relieve my anxiety. The side effects were noticable at first, loss of appetite, being tired all of the time and loss of lobido but they have all gone away and do so in time.

It helped some but never stops the panic/amxiety disorder to make you feel 'human' like Xanax does. I tried to reduce the Zoloft to the point of getting off of it. Big mistake. The side effects for getting off Zoloft are horrible. Numbness in the mouth and hands, crying all the time, jitters, feeling like your skin is coming off. The side effects are far worse than continuing to take the Zoloft 100mg a night. Soon I will give it another try to get off Zoloft. Xanax works the best for me without addiction or a drugged feeling. Good luck finding a doc who will prescribe it without making you see a psychiatrist! I recently moved and after some research on the doctor and an initial visit..I am lucky to find one that still believes it works and works well for many of us. 
We shouldn't be taking meds on a whim, as ordered by a doctor, when we don't need or want them. "

The first few days were rough, with a dry mouth and no appetite I lost a lot of weight, and every time I closed my eyes I fell asleep. However, I am stable, and can go on with my life. I am by no means able to feel what I used to, but for me, this is a lifesaver, literally. I can live now.

It helped me feel less depressed the first time I tried it. However, it took away all the rest of my emotions. This time it has again taken away all my emotions, but has made the depression worse. I have difficulty sleeping at night (last week I was up until 6 in the morning most nights.) My appetite has also gone down, and I often feel dizzy and lightheaded (I don't know if this is from the Zoloft directly, or decreased eating.) Also, I have lost all the motivation and inspiration that I used to have. I've found that I don't really care about anything. I'm merely walking through my life, not feeling, not seeing, or experiencing anything. Zoloft has not been a good drug for me, but I know that it does work for other people. Like anything, it's not perfect, and I've heard of just as many people who like it as people who don't like it.

- Everyone reacts differently.  Just because someone had a negative experience on this board does not mean you will.  I did not experience nausea, anxiety, sleeplessness or lethargy.  Others have.
- Start out slowly.  Your doc should put you on a lower dosage and slowly increase it over time.  This helps your body get used to it with less side effects.
- Be patient...it takes 2-3 weeks to kick in.  So you might not feel any benefit until much later on.
- It doesn't change who you are.  That was my fear.  I didn't want a happy pill.  It did lift my depression so I saw things more clearly.  I am still the same person. However, if you had life problems before this pill won't make them go away.  It will help you to deal with them for effectively by making you functional."

Happier thoughts, more outgoing and less anxiety in front of groups, more desire to be social. Some side effects are nausea even when taken with food in the morning, tiredness for about 1-2 hours after taking the medication. And the worst is weight gain even when maintaining a healthy moderate diet and exercise. I gained about 12 pounds in 6 weeks. Finally, feeling better and gradually off the drug with hopes of loosing the weight and staying healthy. I would recommend this drug in low dose for short term.

No appetite at all, and even with a Ambien I get about 3-4 hours of sleep at night and have no energy. What I wrestle with the most as this continues on is this horrible lack of motivation. It's the worst.
I have been on many anti-deps. since returning from Vietnam but I have been on Zoloft the longest. I don't know if I can ever be a happy person again, personally I don't think so, but, I continue on with what God has given to me, living the best I can and doing what ever I can for others. I pray for the strength to deal with what remains and maybe with Gods Grace and the right meds things WILL get better. Everybody keep your heads up! God Love & Bless one and all!!"

It makes me feel physically better, but it doesn't really help me get back to feeling ""happy"".  In fact I really don't feel much at all.  It has kind of just numbed all of my feelings, I guess is the best way I can put it.  I still think about everything that has made me angry and depressed quite often, and I know I should be really tore up and distressed, but I just don't feel it.  Which isn't a bad thing I suppose.  It's a much better mental state to be in than moping around and sobbing all the time.  I still don't really feel motivated to succeed or care about anything all that much, but at least now I don't feel like laying in bed and crying all day.  I am able to get up in the morning and try to put forth a LITTLE effort to acheive some form of productiveness during the day.  However, concerning my little ""not caring"" trend, my grades are in serious trouble and are declining rather swiftly.  It is very difficult to focus and pay attention to lectures some days.  Use with extreme caution if you are a student in school as this medication could pose a threat to your GPA.  The only physical side effects I have experienced so far are trouble sleeping, extreme jitteryness (esp. in the hands/legs), light dizzyness spells (standing up/driving), and weight loss.  I haven't really lost my appetite but I feel energized all the time.  I've started running and working out almost daily which would explain the slender and trim new me.  That's really what comes to mind when I think of this pill.  Weight loss lol.  Not complaining though.  The quality of life for me may not necessarily seem better while on this drug, but it has made it bearable and a little brighter.  Hope this helps."

I was on Zoloft for exactly 4 weeks and at the beginning of the third week, the severe sexual side effects (total loss of interest and decreased ability) were unbearable. This had induced a severe hypomania episode that lasted for days. I had to see my Dr. and have the medication discontinued to stop the mania. This medication also seemed to severely increase my anxiety. My thoughts raced uncontrollably, and they were not good thoughts. This medication works well for DEPRESSION, but will put your mood at the other end of the spectrum (mania) if you're not taking a mood stabilizer at the same time.

I took HALF a 25mg tablet before bed with food. Stayed up for about 2 hours and felt fine so I went to bed. When I woke up in the morning I experienced waves of INTENSE panic, sweating, nausea, feelings of unreality, shaking, etc. The only thing I could do was take .5mg Klonopin, I was so distressed it took 2 hours for me to calm down enough to feel the effects of the Klonopin. (Normally I talk half of a .5 and I'm more or less sedated.) After calling my psychiatrist twice with no answer, my therapist suggested that I go to the ER and be admitted to the psych ward because I was in such a state. 

No thanks, this is one I won't be taking again...or any other SSRI for that matter. I've been med free for 10 years with this problem and it looks like it'll be staying that way. "

My children,spouse,and grandchildren also seem to be very supportive knowing that I have problems with depression, they listen when I need to just let loose...*I do admit, sometimes I am not an easy person to get along with., without the Zoloft, I am a total mess...Thanks for listening and reading my experience with Zoloft.  Depression can either make you or break you- let your family, friends, and healthcare provider know what you are feeling, it does help!!!

The first 4 days I took 25 mg at dinner time - it made me a little nauseous, a little light headed a little tired and feeling wozzy. But it went away later in the night. I started taking a whole pill on the 5th day (50Mg) at bed time- hoping I would sleep through the feeling that seemed to come on an hour after taking it. I have been on it for a week now. And I do notice a difference in my mood- I am not as edgey but I really dont feel much emotionaly. I hope that changes. I am having issues reaching an orgasim. I hope this goes away as well. Sex is the one thing that didn't make me feel depressed or anxious.

I used to have horrible panic attacks in certain social situations.  No more! I was anxious and afraid nearly all the time. I am now mostly calm and relaxed. I used to have obsessive/intrusive thoughts. Not so much anymore.  I don't have to count everything now.  On the down side my sex drive is reduced somewhat and I gained 10 lbs. but these are small sacrifices for the overall improvements in the quality of my life. I am much easier to live with say my husband and adult children. I still take responsibility for my health and immerse myself in good and whole and positive things. I do not expect this pill to make me feel awesome every moment of my life.  Zoloft is another tool I use along with a strong belief in and dependence upon a higher power, a constant striving to do the next right thing, connection to family members and support network, sobriety and service to others -- all in an effort to live a good and useful life. Zoloft enables me to add joy to the mix.

The only thing that I don't like is that for some reason it has made me break out, which I rarely use to. Not sure if this is a common side effect.

Instead of feeling horrible/suicidal, you feel mostly nothing. DO NOT quit taking abruptly, nausea and malaise worse than you can believe; absolute disorientation and crazy mood swings.

1816$Condition: Depression$2/10/2009 1:02:31 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I started on a very low dose (25mg) 6 yrs ago, gradually incr'g the dose over time. (I'm sensitive to medication and was apprehensive to start tx, but so desperate for help, I was willing to try). Soon after starting tx, I developed a constant,low-grade head ache. It differed from the usual type of headache. It was a dull, heavy- feeling of pressure in the front of my head. I actually had the feeling that the drug was working on the part of my brain not functioning properly. I took comfort in that, and actually felt that it was fixing the biochemical ""snafu"" in my head. Once the head ache was gone(usu. lasted 3-7 days.), I felt fabulous, happy, and peaceful. My initial symptoms returned in 3-4 wks,& my dose was incr'd to 50mg. This pattern repeated itself consistently over the next several mths,w/lenghtening periods of improvement w/each 25mg increase.I stabilized at 100mg/day. I was a calmer, more peaceful, happier individual--no longer suffering from extreme feelings of hopelessness and despair, distractedness,  having no patience, and being agitated at the simplest things. I once again felt happy to be alive, and grateful to be the person I hadn't been in a very,very long time. The neg.side effects I experienced were forgetfulness and wt. gain. Also, during the short-lived ""head ache"" period described above, I also got the ""yawns"" ~6 hrs. after taking medication. After being incr'd to 150mg/day a year and a half after starting tx (my symptoms had started to return, but anxiousness and edginess more so, than despair,etc.--caused by sudden job loss & life upheaval), the forgetfulness became so bad at this higher dose, that I was once driving on a familiar road close to home, and suddenly didn't recognize it, it scared me. My Dr. rx'd Wellbutrin XL 150mg to ""lift the fog"" I was experiencing which I took at the same time as zoloft,in the a.m.,and soon was no longer forgetful,but sharp-thinking/focused AND a decr'd appetite which resulted in the loss of gained wt.!!

1825$Condition: Depression$2/5/2009 10:51:40 PM$Reviewer: loftlover, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $2$3$4$"I started taking Zoloft in 1999.  Prior to that I had been having panic attacks which gradually turned into depression.  I can relate to previous comments regarding the first week or so of treatment.  I didn't sleep very much and became obsessed with getting enough sleep which, in turn, raised my anxiety level.  I felt like a caged animal and couldn't sit still.

It did help eliminate my panic attacks and seemed to get rid of most of my depression symtoms.  I was off of the drug for most of 2004, but started taking it again towards the end of the year.  It seemed to work, but not as well as before.  My mood was fairly good, but I became easily overwhelmed by my day-to-day responsibilities and would tend to isolate myself.  I had NO motivation or interest in my work and in my family activities.  Just recently (within the past month) I started taking Abilify to augment the Zoloft and have had a tremendous improvement in my mood and feel much more motivated."

The first week was rough due to the reactions my body gave. I got the whole inability to sleep, waking up sweating, slightly swollen gums, killed the sexual sideand interest side effects. Whatever you do, don't drink alcohol for the first 2 weeks while on it. While my body was getting use to the meds, I would wake up sweating more when I had a drink than not. 

I started with 25mg/day for the first week and then did 50mg/day for the next 4 weeks. Right now I'm up to 100mg/day. Yes it made me tired after taking it in the morning but I would wake up the next day refreshed. If I took it before I went to bed(50mg) I would wake up dead tired. Currently trying half pill(50mg) before bead and the other half of the pill when I wake up. 

The good effects about it I can tell it makes me feel a little bit happier and I don't feel as rushed to get in and out of the publics eye. I actually whant to get out some when I have the energy to (side effect is it kills your motivation a bit). 

I might try another later as I'm just getting the full effect so we'll see how it goes later. So far the effects are good I'll eventually bump up the doesage."

I must take zoloft in the afternoon as I would begin yawning 6 hrs. after ingestion.  I have gained about 15 lbs. which my be due to other conditions.  My Dr. said I just may have to take this for a long time, not to worry about it if it is helping me cope and live my life.  I do have insomnia and take 5 mg ambien at night.

I had felt so bad for so long I could not believe how it felt to be happy again.  I know this is not supposed to happen...but I actually lost weight on the medicine. I suppose I no longer over ate after the depression was abated.   And my libido changed, for the better.  I know the counseling helped as well.  As a nurse, I always felt a stigma about folks who needed antidepressants but now I know better from my own personal experience.  Treat your depression, life really is worth living!

Much like Paxil, the effects wear off after a few years, but, hey-- changing every few years is no big deal!  I had virtually no side effects, that I recall.  My sex drive is only so-so, but I don't think the med is the whole reason, if its part of it at all.  I think its worth a try for most people, since I've heard of it helping others I know, too.  I see other people have had side effects, but I guess everyone is different.  This medicine didn't make me ""happy"", but it didn't leave me feeling ""flat"", like serzone. (notice the ""zone"" in serzone)  Overall, not impressive.  If you're really depressed, I'd try something stronger.  I'm supposed to try abilify with my prozac soon, and from the reviews, I'm terrified to try it!! Overall, a good enough med, not fantastic. Pretty easy to tolerate, and worth a try!"

1876$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/13/2009 7:37:11 PM$Reviewer: Hopeful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$Just received a RE for 50 mg of Zoloft and Xanax as needed today, to treat severe panic disorder and anxiety. I read thru all the postings on WedMD, and truly appreciate everyones feedback. It is very helpful to know what one may need to expect & what you all have gone thru. I've had severe rections to drugs/foods/chemicals all my life. My DR indicated 4 to 6 weeks for the full affects, and not to give up. Go to her office/get a hug/call as is needed. She is sweet/super! In my late 20's, after several misscarriages, I went thru a period of consistant fear, feeling of failure, and attacks... Resolved until now. At 45, the attacks/fear started with threats from a crazy neighbor (kill my animals, hurt me and my daughter, etc.) and break-ins to some of the out-buildings on our little farm, not to mention the economy. I first found myself consistantly checking that everything is secured late fall 08, being VERY anxious and very cranky out of no reason, angry attachs for no reason. Hives, sweating, neck and back pain, upset stomach, etc., too may symptoms to name. My husband is out of town on business a lot, which escalated my fear. Then everything fell apart on voting day at the volunteer fire depatment in front of five local grandma's. I have since has panic attacks everywhere; grosery store, bank, Lowes, Home Depot, project meetings, answering the phone, Dr's office today. It has been just horrible, to the point where I don't leave the house unless I absolutely have to, ordered a huge gate for the entry, etc. From what I have read, this drug could be a wonder for what I need... calm nerves and my happy self back, so I can take care of my family, goats, and business. Wish me luck!

I hate the side effects, though.  For me, I often have no appetite, I have a very decreased sexual desire, and sometimes I feel very NEUTRAL about things.  (I know that the medication is meant to level my moods, but it often makes me feel ""stuck"" in the middle, and I find it difficult to motivate myself to do things.  I recognize that is a side effect for me, so I have to make an effort to ""jump start"" myself out of the ""funk"" that I feel.
The side effects are unpleasant, but NOT taking my medication is WORSE.  If I don't take my Zoloft as prescribed, after about 2 days, I really start to feel funny.  (I get what I call the ""blinkies"", I hear swishing when I blink or turn my head quickly.  It is kind of like the sound you hear when you have water in your ears.  It is bothersome.  After a few more days, I begin to notice a severe change in my mood.  I fly off the handle or cry or get emotional over the most minor things.  I have tried just about every antidepressant there is, and even with the side effects, I have the best results with Zoloft."

1886$Condition: Depression$1/7/2009 7:24:08 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Zoloft has been very effective for treating my depression, even compared to other SSRIs.  It took about a month to really start working once I began taking it.  The drug is a very effective libido suppressor but has not caused any other major side effects in use.  However, if you can plan ahead and skip a dose before having sex, one can overcome the libido problem without having adverse effects upon the depression.  Dose reduction and withdrawl does need to be done very slowly, over a period of several months.  When I reduced the dose too fast, I ended up with a bad depressive episode, though I knew why and was able to cope with it. Restoration to the original dose reversed the problem in a few days.  Missing more than a couple of doses in a row also caused some of the strangest dreams I've ever had.  Not bad, just really weird.  Finally, one needs to be careful taking the generic version of this drug.  The first generic version of the drug I took, which looked like the original Zoloft pill, felt like I was taking about 2/3 of my dose.  After switching to a different generic version, a larger oval shaped pill, I had no more problems.  Note that the regular Zoloft pill and both generics were labeled as 100 mg doses.

I was still very anxious everyday and panic attacks several times a month. I did not have any problems going off the drug. I took my time and weaned very slowly.  Everyone is different though, it might work great for you. If not there are many others out there.

My doctor and I talked about me possibly having premenstrual disphoric disorder.  I started taking 50 mg of zoloft, and it has made a huge difference.  I don't feel at all like I've even taken any meds.  I am not jittery, I sleep like a baby, I just have no side effects from the meds.  When my menstrual cycle comes around, I have no tears, no depression, no anxiety, no wanting to just quit life altogether.  This medication has been wonderful for me.  I could not continue going on with the severity of symptoms I was experiencing. I'm not thrilled with the idea of having to take anything more than my usual vitamins, but when I think of how my life was, I am way OK with taking zoloft for a long time to come.

I guess the two were the right mix for me and I felt pretty much back to normal and was able to get back to a normal life. I was on a good mix, and I have read where Zoloft is helping people but they still feel low, so I would suggest talking to your Dr about adding something different to whatever you are already on that is helping some, but adding something like Wellbutrin to help curb what your medication is not doing.

However, I was on this meidcation from may-oct 2008 and the more I took the med the worse I felt. I had panic attacks that worsened on this medication. I also had morbid or unsettling thoughts and this is not my nature.  When I started crying uncontroloably I had to be hosiptilized.  I had odd or unusualy dreams on the med (i.g. I dreamed I put salt in a washing machine).   I have been on Paxial since october 31,2008 and today is 12/22/2008.  So far I have been relieved of the panic attacks and my thoughs don't dwell on death or other things.  I also has a friend that had felt like driving over a cliff on this med.  If you have any of the unsettling thoughs please see a certified Phy. not a primary care physcian.  My PCP is great but the truth is she does not specialize in anti-depressents.  With Counseling and taking paxial and Trazidone I feel better for now.  However the debilitating effects of the Zoloft did not hit me for a few months.  God bless.  I hope Zoloft is working for you it is a wonderful drug for most people but not for me."

Zolofot has changed my life! I had been on medications given to me by my gereral practionor that made me worse ( prozac, clexea) I finally found a wonderful therapist & physiatrit who work not only with me but together to make my treatment effective. My physiatrist gave me a choice of two different meds to try I chose the zoloft. I started working within days! I still have my depressive days and moods, but they are nothing like I lived with almost my whole life. The key is finding the right medication for you!! I do dislike some of the side effects, but will take them over the depressive stat I was in. I now am able to know what it's like to be normal and enjoy things in life. I'm no longer moody, mean, rude or anxious!! Everyone has different symptoms and needs and a good doctor will be able to know what is right for you. Somtimes it take more than one drug to make it right. I also take another anti depressant at night for sleeping. With combined talk therapy and medications I have my life for the first time in almost 40 years. I'd be lost with out zoloft

I was placed on xanax daily and Remeron.  After 6 months of treatment and doing a cognitive therapy program I was doing a great deal better.  However, the anxiety was there everyday to some degree.  I have felt anxiety for the last 9 years to some degree or another.  I continued to push it aside and tried my best to ignore it and just function.  After an extremely stressful year I had one of the worst panic attacks I ever had in a hotel room.  Needless to say I am now on Zoloft after much stubborness of refusing to go on meds.  I thought I could handle it all.  It was bigger than me.  I still have anxious thoughts, but my body doesn't react with the physical symptoms now.  I still will get sweaty palms, a racing heart, etc., but to a MUCH lesser degree and it dissipates very quickly instead of escalading!  I started on 25mg. for 7 days, then to 50mg. and my dr. increased me to 100mg.  I didn't want to go that high, but I am glad I did!!
I didn't know a medicine could help me this much.  It's a little sad to think I suffered for so long and there was medicine that could help so much!! I have only been taking this for 5 weeks.  The difference in my life is very substancial!"

My mother was diagnosed with cancer and I this triggered my doctor to prescribe the medication but I believe I have always suffered from some degree of depression and anxiety.  For the first few months it was making me quite tired but now I feel as if I have quite a bit of energy and am active for my entire day as opposed to ""taking a nap"" almost every day.  I exercise and eat right and generally keep my weight in check so I did try more natural methods before medication.  I started on 50mm was feeling better but still crying quite easily and am now taking 100mm every day and feel quite good, can handle more tasks, generally enjoy life a little more.  The side effects that I do notice are some constipation, some short term memory loss, somewhat impulsive (but maybe I needed to be a little more impulsive) and I am now beginning to notice weight gain slowly which is why I am considering weaning myself from this medication.  Someone recommended SAM-E.  Is anyone familiar with this over the counter medication?  Any other suggestions are appreciated."

1929$Condition: Depression$12/12/2008 9:14:13 PM$Reviewer: NWCT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$2$4$"W/drawal symptoms are real! How I tapered off two years ago after being on it for 10 years: I took low doses of 5-HTP during this time and was eating better. Taking the pill every other day, as is suggested, did not work. I needed to gradually shave off bits of the Zoloft each day for over two weeks (which was a comfortable rate for me.) I was taking the lower mg blue pill at the time, so it might work to start with the yellow (50mg?) shave it down to half the size then start the blue pill(25mg?). St. John's Wort was taken after I was completely off the Zoloft for a while. If I got irritable/jittery (too much seritonin?), I took L-theanine liquid drops. These can be found in natural food stores and I highly recommend seeing a naturalpath and reading books such as ""The Mood Cure"" and The Food-Mood Connection by Jack Challem. 
I have Dysthimia (mild depressive personality) and have never been hospitalized, but had I known what I know now when I was 19 and started taking them, I would have looked at diet (too much sugar!) and lack of exercise first before taking the drugs. If I had major depression, then no hesitation, I'd take them.  Anti depressants are not to be taken lightly! 
Now, after being free of the Zoloft for two years, I'm considering taking Welbutrin for a while, but this time I plan on keeping it brief and making more of an effort to eat better mood foods/exercise. I prefer to try to locate causes of depression/anxiety rather than to simply treat symptoms with pills, but maybe I need to treat the symptoms before I can start a proper routine. 
There must be a delicate balance between neurotransmitters and hormones and gut flora. There must be a subtle forces at work that have foods and exercise so greatly influence moods and energy. I want to listen to the body and mind enough to find the right balance. Medication is for now a stop-gap; a floor to stand on and not a crutch. This time I intend to be mindful and not ""pop pills!""  "

Now when I first started it I had to call in to work because my eyes dilated and it made it hard to read; I think that wore off in a few days. I think it may have been the 2nd month (could have been during the 1st) I suddenly gained 20lbs; and I worked a physical job. I do believe it was during this time the medicine started to have no effect. I stayed with it because I wanted to be better and I thought it would help. I finally gave up on it after about a year and just stopped taking it (I know, bad). I noticed after being on Zoloft that I get more angry (and easier) and can't control my emotions like I once could; I'm more emotional. Obviously everyone is different so my experience may be completely different than yours. All I know is now I wish I had never taken that medicine, I am more depressed than ever, slight paranoia has been added to the mix, I still can't control my emotions as easily and can cry or get pissed at the dumbest little things that didn't used to bother me before Zoloft. For those that it works, I am happy it do so for you. It's not easy to find something that works and works well.

I have always been depressed since my mother died of cancer when I was 11.  I was also on it to treat heavy mood swings towards anger/rage that would be over absolutely nothing.  I was on 50mg/day.  I didn't notice a huge change in my mood myself but others around me did.  My depression was slightly better but I would often still be in a less than great mood.  It helped my anger and mood swings noticably.  I would still get angry over things but I wouldn't go into a rage.  The only side effect I noticed was severe drowsiness.  I would drink anything with caffeine in it and still be yawning a lot.  When I thought I was better I had to VERY SLOWLY get off of it.  When I tried cold turkey, I felt like passing out and extreme dizziness constantly.  I should not have quit taking it.  I am currently trying Prozac to avoid the drowsiness.

Before I started Lustral(Zoloft), I still had violent outbursts related to my ADHD, but they became an awful lot more frequent. I stayed on them for two years before deciding to ween myself off them at my own accord. My OCD had greatly improved. When I was 18, I went back to the doctor due to feeling extremely depressed. He put me back on Lustral as it was one that had worked for me in the past. Within two weeks, I was manic/happy but was acting severely out of character, I did a lot of things I reget within that time. After weening myself off them, I was still getting horrific violent thoughts and extreme paranoia. I came out of remission pretty quick and ended up being prescribed Cipramil (Celexa) and it has helped to calm me down a great deal. People say I'm a joy to be with now.

In general, after starting Zoloft, I just felt happy and realtively relaxed. 

However it did kill my libido.   I also had to keep increasing the dose as it's efficiacy would wear-off over time. At 200mg I started to feel foggy-headed and unmotivated, so I SLOWLY got off of it (25 mg less per day, so as to avoid the very nasty withdrawl symptoms). 

I then tried being off of Zoloft for two months but I was very unhappy and highly emotional so I started it up again. As a result I am feeling much happier as I write. However, I know this will last for only a period of time as it did last time. Ah, if only I could feel good all of the time for the rest of my life, but some time is better than no time.

My family really noticed a huge difference in my mood swings with this drug, and after giving this drug several months trial, I discontinued its use.

I suddenly didn't care about anything: self, family, etc. There was no enjoyment in life anylonger. I have taken Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Paxil and Cymbalta with no apparent relief. Changed doctors. Now Zoloft in the AM and Xanax as needed, up to 3 a day. Major positive changes occuring. I'm still exactly like I was, but I get out of the house now, have started old hobbies, and best of all, I've become a part of my family again. I'm sold at this point.

My doctor gradually increased my the amount I took to as much as 275mg a day during the year that I took it. It did not work nearly as well as Prozac did before it caused me headaches. I found that it caused me to have a short temper and to get very mad. I found myself saying things   say things to people that I would that I did not intent to say or that I would never say in the past. This problem I later found may have also been caused be a reaction with Topamax that I am taking as well. I also had terrible sexual side effects in that it was very difficult for me to have an orgasm, I felt the energizer bunny with a dildo attached! I switched to Lexapro that works much better for migraine with out the sexual problem that I did not need.

It was horrible.  I was such a confident woman, and all of a sudden I didn't want to be around people, or my job.  I tried everything, relaxation tapes, running, walking, deep breathing exercises, nothing worked.  Two weeks of inability to sleep, panic attacks, and being a good actress at work I finally went to my doctor, and sh put me on Zoloft 50 mg.  I felt like this medication was not going to work, I read what others had posted, and it said to be patient.  I thank God I was patient! Almost 2 months after taking Zoloft I feel like myself again.  I don't haven't had a panic attack in a month, and I feel good, except for sometimes feeling tired.  If Zoloft doesn't work for you don't give up!!  Go to your doctor until they find the right medication for you!  There is always hope!  Even when you feel there isn't any :)

I had anxiety attacks and lots of anxiety before this traumatic event.  After suffering for about 8 years from these conditions, I started on Zoloft.  It worked gradually and was very helpful for all the conditions.  The side effects are, decreased sense of smell and taste, waking up very easily and not being able to go back to sleep, vivid, unplesant dreams, decreased sexual drive, forgetfulness, frequent strong feelings of sadness and weepiness, inability to let go of painful feelings about sad or unfair life events of others and myself.  I would like to find out if a combination of Zoloft with some other drug such as Lexipro or Wellabutrin could help decrease these negative feelings but am afraid to tamper with my present and continuing relative improved state of mind.

I am currently taking 100mg every morning.  My husband and those around me say they notice a big difference.  I just notice my husband and I dont fight anymore (at least not serious fights).  I also have OCD tendancies and anxiety attacks, this helps but I still have an attack once in awhile, I take Xanex for that.  I dont feel any different on or off the meds but I suppose thats a good thing.  My therapist has said I am co-dependant on my mother (who is depressed and addicted to drugs) and zoloft has really really helped with that.  I am not longer her ""btch"" and we dont fight nearly as much.  I dont feel responsible for her any longer.  Honestly if it werent for Zoloft I truly believe my husband would have left me by now and I would be living with my mother waiting on her hand a foot.  
I cant physically tell a difference with Zoloft but when I step back and look at my reactions and how I process things, I am a much happier person and I have more patience.  I am not exausting myself tring to make everyone else happy and not feeling so guilty for making me happy.  Who would have thought, ""making yourself happy"".  How can you please others when youre miserable?  YOU CANT!  I tried for 29 years.  Zoloft has given me my life back and now my relationship with everyone in my family is better.  I have found new frineds though, apparently they liked the old me, they say I have changed. "

2031$Condition: Depression$10/16/2008 7:05:51 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$This was the worst medication I was ever put on. My doctor prescribed it to me for depression, 100 mg a day. After my first dose, I had fatigue and felt completely drained of energy. I had errands to run that day, and this medication made it almost impossible because I barely had the willpower to get up. Over the next few days, the symptoms continued, and I felt like a walking corpse. I didn't get excited, angry, happy, sad...I just generally felt nothing at all and had no desire to do anything but sit at home staring at the TV like a zombie. I also had a decreased appetite and only ate because I knew I had to. To top it off, my sex drive was non-existent. I couldn't get an erection at all, not that I was in the mood to have sex anyways because I didn't feel like doing anything at all. My doctor told me that all these symptoms were normal and that they would go away the more I used it. But after day 3, I finally couldn't take it anymore and stopped using it. I felt better the way I did before I started taking it. This medication basically made me feel 10 times worse, and putting up with it any longer with the hope these side effects would go away was just not worth it for me. I guess it might help some people, but this was just simply a nightmare medication for me. I am now on 0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed, and am finally experiencing the quality of life I have been searching for.

I did gain a few pounds but was very underweight before i started. I still do get bad days even with meds but its way better then everyday being bad. Also low sex drive but i think the benefits out weigh the side effects.

I would have panic attacks in really crowded stores. Alot of this was caused by stress.
A friend of mine told me she was taking Zoloft and maybe I should look into it and talk to my Dr.
Its been 28 months later and I do feel better. My husband and I have both been taking it and now I'm seeing some differences. Im noticing that when I drink coffee it seems like it liquifies everything in my stomach. And sometimes thinking I have gas and will have lost control of my bowels. Frequent headaches and stomach pain if one to two doses are missed.
I also suffer from Endometriosis and am taking the depo provera shot and have been for about 3 years. Im just trying to find out if there are more people out there that are going through what I am.
Other than the health problems,(that I don't even know if they are related to Zoloft), I do not have panic attacks in Wal-Mart or Costco anymore and I can handle just about anything now to the point of crying. When I want to cry there are no tears. I'm numb."

I'm on the 50mg dose for my anxiety/stress and social anxiety that's mainly biological.  They said that it would be between 2-6 weeks to kick in.  For me, it took the entire 6 weeks.  I experienced a couple of side effects like nausea in the first week.  It also makes me super tired so I just take it before going to bed.  Some times I wake up and feel super dehydrated but that's the worst thing.  I've never slept so soundly in my life!  Let's just say that this month I start school, moving, and changing hours at my job and I've handled it all with ease.  Hopefully I'll only have to be on this for a year at the most.  So good!

When my husband died in a car accident during my 8th month, we increased my dosage.  My baby was, and still is, very normal (many people say she's highly intelligent).  I was very nervous about it affecting her, but now I see that the doctors were right about it being safe during pregnancy.  Whew!  

This medication has helped me for over a year and I think it saved my sanity during very difficult times.  I have recommended it to others and now my cousin even takes it and says his confidence has remarkably improved!  He has started dance classes, which is completely out of character (he's very shy).

The PROS:  greatly reduced anxiety (without the 'high' feeling that Xanax gives), lots of calmness/evenesss, and a big help with crying/sadness!  When I tried to get off of the medication, I had a hard time even getting out of bed each day, so I went back on it.  

The MAYBES:  I don't seem to notice much affect on my OCD and I still haven't lost much weight from my pregnancy.  I don't necessarily eat more or less, but I'm bigger than I used to be.  Not sure if that's the medication or not.

The CONS:  still have mildly reduced motivation, decreased sex drive, and I've become more 'dingy' and forgetful.  If you can deal with that, the benefits are great!  "

2161$Condition: Panic Disorder$6/11/2008 1:16:15 PM$Reviewer: rosewhite, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I suffered since my teens with a panic disorder, but didn't know that what I had was real or treatable. As a teen, I would tell my doctor that my heart would race, and was told to lay off the caffeine. I was told that I was too sensitive, emotional, etc. by my parents. I lived as best I could, becoming an over-achiever in the process.  This just added to my stress and numbness. Finally, in my 30's, I told my doctor that I was going crazy and needed help.  I couldn't drive, was emotionally numb, and had no joy. My doctor told me that I wasn't crazy.  He recommended therapy, and I went.  The therapist recommended medication.  My doctor prescribed 100mg Zoloft.  I have a life now that I have never had.  I didn't know that you weren't supposed to be afraid or sad all the time, hiding the pain behind a mask. I have been taking the generic Zoloft for about 3 years now, and it has changed my life totally. My only regret is that I didn't ask for help sooner.

So i went to the doctor and she perscribed Zoloft.  My dose went all the way up to 200mg at first but within a couple months I ended up at 100mg.  I stayed there for a couple of years until I went down to 50mg.  The medication has helped me greatly.  I had such severe anxiety that it led to depression.

At one point, I was afraid to fall asleep and unable to leave the house. I have tried Celexa, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, klonipin, and valium either alone or in combination with other meds and cognitive behavioral therapy. All of these meds were beneficial but I experienced sexual side effects (Celexa and Lexapro) and tolerance (klonipin)that I was unable to live with. I started taking 50 mg of Zoloft which was slowly increased to 200 mg per day. Overall, I have been happy with the results. The incidence of panic attacks has decreased significantly(down from almost daily to 2 or 3 per month), and I am able to fall asleep because I no longer wake up to the panic attacks. I did experience some side effects (somnolence,sweating, and diarrhea) but none of the sexual side effects or weight gain that occurred with some of the other meds that I have taken. Over time the diarrhea and excessive sweating has disappeared, but I do still have problems with sleepiness. Overall, I have been happy with the results

I had stopped my period and my hormones were wreaking havoc on my mind and body. For over a year I had bumps all over my body that itched like crazy and after 5 dermatologists, allergy specialists, internists no one could find the root cause of the itchiness. I couldn't sleep and had itch attacks in the middle of the night. I was ready to go to the Mayo clinic with all my records when one more appointment with a new allergist suggested zoloft for my itching. After 2 weeks, my overactive system calmed down, I didn't crave sweets, and began to sleep again, I actually lost 15 lbs, I began working out and had my sunny disposition back! I really hesitated using drugs, but nothing else was working, and I was spending over $500 month on creams, ointments, herbs, co-pays, lab tests, etc. which made me itch even more-I didn't want to be labeled - but it is working and I am no longer in a fog."

For 10 years i tried to treat my depression in natural ways (working out, St. Johns, acupuncture, praying, being healthy, etc!), with the haze sometimes lifting for a bit but mostly not.  Zoloft finally gave me my life back and my only regret is that I hadn't taken it MUCH sooner.  The first week was rough--I was tired and dizzy, but then i got some acupucture to help me out of that fog and that got me going again.  Every day was a new adventure in not being depressed.  Wow--I sing to my dog in the morning!  Wow--I don't hate my body!  Wow--I'm not a huge, giant, pathetic loser!  

This drug doesn't work for everyone--my depression manifested as extreme sorrow, loneliness, alination and despair.  I was never manic, never angry--just woefully sad, no  matter how hard I tried to be positive, appreciate what I have, etc. etc.  

I do have delayed orgasm, but not having such huge despair in life more than offsets that.  I do not have a lowered libido.

I have gained 20 lbs. in 1 year on this drug, which is a problem.  It's not taht I was hungry all the time--just that I somehow lost my good discipline around food.  I can't totally blame the drug--I've also been a snacky piggy at work.  I blame 10 lbs. on myself and 10 lbs. on the drug.  

This drug also does not help w/ my physical pain symptoms (intense muscle pain) we believe is from the depression.  I have tried Cymbalta for that but it constipated me horribly.  So I am back to square one and am looking to try a new drug to help w/ the pain--also one that does not cause weight gain!  BTW I work out all the time and am very healthy, and I still gained weight.  Also, I didn't have any major withdrawal from Zoloft/Cymbalta--but I also flood my body w/ vitamins and antioxidants (and acupuncture, exercise and fruits and veggies), and I believe this helps ease withdrawal symptoms in general.   

Good luck finding the right drug!"

So today, he put me on Paxil, 50mg, once a day...along with the Klonopin .50mg as needed...  Hopefully after 1 month the lightheadedness will go away and it will remain gone after i stop the medication altogether.
I hope that I have not become dependent on the zoloft/paxil type medication.

*** ORIGINAL POST ***
I took generic Zoloft for about a year and a half, 50mg, along with .50mg of generic Klonopin (3 times a day). Per the Dr., I took 25mg a day for 1 week, then every other day for 1 week, along with the Klonopin once or twice day. I recently stopped both altogether since the slight anxiety has stopped. However, I've been feeling lightheaded lately so I called my Dr and he put me back on Klonopin .50mg once a day before bed. I hope that will make the lightheadness go away. Zoloft seemed to have worked fine. I did seem to lose interest in s*x which was so unlike me. I don't recall feeling any side effects aside from a slight headache every now and then the first few weeks.

What I don't like is I have no sex drive, I eat more and I have diarriah. The sad thing is an attack can happen anywhere and anytime, I think my doctor will up my dosage.

I have Major Depression Requring, and a slew of other mental health issues. I was taking 200mgs a day and I am now on 250mgs for issues with PMDD (premenstral disphoric disorder, formally known as PMS) My depression seems to have lifted, I have been in great moods, my anxeity/panic attacks are MUCH better, yet I am having more trouble with my ADD, and I am having problems with OCD. Also some medical issues. I have had headaches that turn into migraines (which because Zoloft is an SSRI cannot take migrane medication) I have recently begun to have pitting adema issues again, and some violent anger issues. I have although lost almost 25 pounds, and have energy, and pep through out the day. Over-all coming from a person who has almost litreally been on everything in the book, Zoloft has worked wonders for me. I am also happy to report that I am on the lowest amount of phyciatric medications that I have been in a VERY long time. I credit myself for particapating in daily groups, weekly therapy, monthly med checks with my phyciatrist, and taking my medication(s) as perscribed.

I recently stopped both altogether since the slight anxiety has stopped.

However, I've been feeling lightheaded lately so I called my Dr and he put me back on Klonopin .50mg once a day before bed.

I hope that will make the lightheadness go away.

I had anxiety about the anti-anxiety medicine!! I was afraid of how it would make me feel, would I feel like a zombie, would I feel like myself still?? 
Diarreha, no appetite, dizzy, burning sensation in my neck and shoulders. Didn't know if I could continue sticking with it but could not go back to the panic attacks. So I stuck with it and am SO glad I did. 
Most of the side effects were gone after two weeks. And I have not had a panic attack in a month! I still feel like myself. My Dr. prescribed 50mg for 1 week then 100mg after that. Still on just 50mg, don't feel like I need 100mg and Dr. was OK with that.
The remaining side effects are minimal. Sometimes it's hard for me to sleep, my memory isn't as sharp as it was before, my sex drive was decreased but is back to normal now (boyfriend happy about that!) and that's about it. I am scared of it wearing off like I heard it could do, also I'm scared about having to take it forever but that could be the anxiety talking. It works great for me now and I'm not taking that for granted! I love enjoying life again!

For 2 years I have tried to cope with the reality that he was more interested in going to talk to her and would just be silent or have little conversation with me.  He drank alot and became a chain smoker the last two years.  In January this year, I confronted him again about his behavior and he left for the night.  He came back the next day talking about divorce.  I could not believe that my questions about another woman could provoke that action.  I went to my gynocologist for help and he prescribed Zoloft and advised my meeting with a counselor.  I will have to say that the combination of these two helped me keep sane mind.  I will continue taking Zoloft as long as my doctor advises and hopefully it will help my anxiety during my marital problems.  It surely did take the edge off when I could not focus or lost alot of sleep.

Even though I sometimes was not hungry I still would eat something and that helped.  I also decided to take it in the evening since it does make me a little sleepy.  I have definetly noticed a huge decrease in attacks.  To anyone trying to battle panic attacks hang in there.  There will be something that will help. I would much rather suffer for a very short time of side effects than to live everyday with panic attacks that make it difficult to do the simple things in life.  Use the Xanex to get you through.

Started SERTRALINE (generic zoloft) a year ago. Started out on 50mg. upped to 100mg.after two weeks then to 200mg after two more weeks. Also take 50 mg.trazodone for sleep and 10/325mg.Hydrocodone for pain 2x day. (ptsd due to sexual abuse early childhood till age 17) This is an extreme dose for ones body to maintain. Had many doubts for first 3-4 months, overwhelming and scarry, increased suicidal thoughts, shakes, restless leg (body)syndrone, panic attacks, felt very duhhh, foggy, memory loss, BUT I stuck with it and the thoughts have subsided greatly. My mind gets racy and foggy alot, have the shakes bad, but find it is helping with the depression. I would NOT recommend this high of a dose if not severly needed. It seems to impair ones brain processes, I feel foggy alot, disassociate for long periods, tremble in my arms, hands and jaw. I do not work due to an injury from a car wreck 4 years ago. I think the worse side effect for me would be the WEIGHT GAIN. (SEVERE-98 POUNDS IN ONE YEAR) ..(prozac,zoloft,celexa,desipamine,wellbutrine,ef fexor) thats some of the drugs ive been on since 1991 and zoloft seems to be helping with the depression alot, high dose, SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN.JITTERS wierd dreams panic attacks

Didn't get help with meds until late 30's. Have tried seven or eight different meds since.  All had undesirable side effects, including this sertraline (generic Zoloft) which completely vanquished my sex drive, although it kept my mood stable.  I was on Paxil for 11 years and would go back to it because the side effects weren't as severe.

I mostly felt edgy, angry and not in control of my feelings or actions.  After taking this medication, I found myself more calm, able to handle stressful situations in a normal way and not fly off the handle so easily.  I realize that the medication is not for everyone as our chemistry is different but if you are having a problem coping, I would recommend you give Zoloft a try, just make sure you stay under your doctors care and report any changes in your moods, etc.  My only complaint, if I really had one, would be if I forget to take it a day or two, I have really strange dreams but other than that, I have had no side effects.  It was definelty the medicine for me.

Over the next two months I gained 40 pounds. While depression improved somewhat, I think it was due more to getting sleep thanks to Xanax and Ambien rather than from Zoloft. When I stopped taking it I plunged into a deeper depression than before within 48 hours and had suicidal thoughts. Took 3 months of very slow weaning to get myself off Zoloft, and 4 years to lose all the weight. I took it less than a year and my depression finally lifted due to life changes rather than this drug. Will not take again.

The first week was tough, diahreah, jittery, anxious, but it got better and better everyday.The longest lasting side effect was dry mouth, but a few life saver's candies helped a lot! Worth it!

After awhile, it stopped being quite as effective & my dosage was increased. That's when the trouble started.  I developed a tremor in my hands so bad that my finger was constantly tapping the mouse when I was using the computer.  This I could live with, but I developed the most bizarre behavior when I went to bed.  As my muscles were beginning to relax, I would have around 30 minutes of what seemed like grand mal seizures...except that I was awake and conscious.  All limbs and neck would jerk violently...and I couldn't control it.  I just learned to lay there and take it with humor...sorta like some sort of bizarre amustment park ride for 30 minutes.  Weird.  Also restless leg syndrome got extremely bad....I'd try to not move when the urge hit, and after a few seconds, my leg would jerk violently...like nerve synapses were shooting out electrical signals and my muscles HAD to respond to them.  My Dr switched me to Lexapro, and the tremor is gone as are the seizure-like jerking.  I still have restless leg syndrome, but it has greatly diminished in severity.  Lexapro seems to work as well as the Zoloft on depression symptoms, as well.

I sometimes still would experience a day or so of depression but with a dose of Xanax, it'd go away.
About three weeks ago, I felt one of those days coming on so to head it off, took a Xanax. Here I am 3 weeks later and it's still here. I called my doctor a couple of days ago and told him my symptoms had returned...with a vengeance. I could not shake this ""thing"" - I'm irritable, angry at the slightest thing, concentration is nearly zilch...the usual litany. But I also have a series of aches & pains I didn't have before and I'm literally worn out all the time. 
(I took the WebMD depression test and it labeled me as severly depressed. I reckon I didn't know there were different levels of this monster. Now I do.)
Doctor doubled my dose and said it'll take about a week for me to adjust. I'm anxious to see. 
Knowing I could feel so good for the time I did and then slipping into this fugue again is even more depressing.
I pray the increased dosage helps. I'm at my wits end. "

After taking a Xanax before bed last night i was relaxed and happy and i slept like a baby. but when i took 1 Zoloft after i got to work this morning (around 9 a.m.) i started to feel sick to my stomach and had no appetite what-so-ever. i was miserable and i felt like crying. this last pretty much all day until my afternoon break at 2 o'clock. even though i had no appetite i did manage to force myself to eat some toast and plain potato chips...and some sprite to sip on. And now it's almost 3 and i feel completely fine (eating M&M's). earlier i wouldn't have been able to look at food.. I can understand why some people would complain of weight loss if you feel like you're about to throw up when you try to chew something and swallow it. but you have to. small snacks help. crackers...chips...anything like that i have to force myself to eat and i always feel better afterwards. thank god today is friday so i can deal with the side effects at home this weekend. i'm ready for this stuff to kick in...i don't know which is worse...feeling like i did before the meds or the way i feel now. it also doesn't help that i have a cough/cold and i'm PMS-ing!!!! hope this helps someone so they at least know what to expect. after the side effects go away i forget how sick i was and it's so easy for someone to make me laugh, until they start to come back. even if you can't eat...DO IT! i've heard more good things about this drug than bad...so i'm going to give it a try...unless i know for sure it's hopeless or my side effects get worse. i know this drug isn't for everyone.

My sypmtoms included having trouble remembering details/thoughts, headaches, tiredness, anxiety about what people thought of me, and trouble putting myself in large group settings (I'm a very outgoing person).  I was also in a very difficult marriage and was contemplating leaving.  The first two weeks of Zoloft were awful.  I had horrible headaches, pain all over my brain.  I was tired but could not sleep.  I took the pill with milk, but I was hungry and could not eat. I also experienced increased brain activity, where it was almost as though I could feel ""energy"" in my head...hard to describe.  Additionally I remember a few nights where the sleeplessness caused me to feel suicidal, I had almost evil thoughts, ""maybe I would be better off dead"", ""why am I here""...  I took off work for these two weeks (highly recommended) and luckily I was blessed with a mentor who had been through anti-deppressants and he constantly brought me back to reality.  Once I went to my prescribed dose (50mg--I had been taking half-pills for a few days) the symptoms got much less drastic, but I still struggled with sleeping.  I found a small fountain of water next to my bed helped.  It is now a year and half later and I am doing amazing, I feel like I have my life back!  I cannot imagine going off of this medication as I am much more present in my life.  I have noticed some possible sexual side effects, as it is harder for me to experience orgasm.  I worry about pregnancy and breastfeeding and having to make those decisions, but I am very happy on Zoloft.  I will say if you are not happy or if your side effects persist, try something else!  This is such a hit/miss drug as I know those who are successful with it and some that hate it.  Also, be careful with missing doses, sometimes if it is the middle of the day, I will only take a half pill, but you will have headaches, resting helps this."

It has really calmed me down.  I no longer fight the anxiety feelings that used to keep me feeling like I was in a cage or wanting to jump off of the roof, or drive my car off of a bridge.  My only concern/big concern is that I have no desire for sexual intercourse and that have left me feeling numb.  However, I rather trade the anxiousness, racing heart, suicidal thoughts, racing mind and lack of concentratin in for some degree of normalcy that Zoloft affords me.  My husband doesn't seem to mind, or he hasn't expressed a concern.  He's 7 years my senior and in his mid 50s.  I'll continue to try and work on the lack of continuous sexal drive issue because, everyone once in a while I crave sex.  To help me out in the sexual area I've purchased an electronic friends (Super Mario) and he helps me out in that area.  In the meantime everyonce in a while I do  crave intimacy (Super Mario)isn't able to afford me.  For now, I'm ok with the sanity I've been given, and the calm state of being.  Thank God for Zoloft, and the calmness it brings me.  I'm even started back doing crossword puzzles.  Something, I haven't done for years, and I'm also doing suduko.  My what a relief - Thank you Zoloft.

I have been on so many antidepressants that I can't even remember them all.  None of them worked for me and I stopped taking any at all for several years because I felt like a zombie.  After much research and a serious bout of depression last year, I asked my Dr to prescribe Zoloft.  I started on a very small dose in April and slowly worked up to 150mg. Things that used to bother me and make my life hard, don't bother me anymore.  I have been on Zoloft for 10 months now and am also in therapy. My friends and family all can see how I have changed into a calmer person who does not ""flip out"" or sweat the small stuff anymore.  I am a happier person and able to handle so much more than I could before.  I do believe, however, that any antidepressant is a tool to enable you to be able to work on yourself and how you think and react to things by using therapy in conjunction with antidepressants.  This is the first time in my life that I have done this and when I look back to how I was a year ago, the change is amazing."

I was on a relatively low dose, but it worked very well. The only real problem that I had with this treatment was the effect it had on my libido. I had almost no sexual desire while on this drug. While this was frustrating the improvement in my mood and motivation made it a fair trade. The other thing that I noticed (after I was off) was how much it was also moderating my good moods. I felt good, not depressed, but at the same time my normally happy/hyperactive personality was toned way down. I didn't realize how much I missed it until I came off the medication and started feeling really happy and fun again.

I am better able to balance competing demands (family/home, school aged kids, work, etc) and I'm a much nicer person to be around.  The only long term side effect I have is deminished sex drive.

I went through four weeks of hell. I had back flashes of everything bad that went on in my life.At four week the doctor raised it to 100mg. I started feeling somewhat normal. Then two weeks later the med was increased to 150mg. after the second day I went back to 100mg because I felt bad again. Back flashes severe anxiety, edgy, jumping to conclusions, thinking people were trying to hurt me. I have yet after four days of going back to 100 mg changed I will stay at this amount until I hear from the doctor. And mind you I have called four times this week and no one has gotten back to me. I can't sleep at night, my legs are worse (restless leg syndrome) and the only thing that helps is Klonopin which doc wants me off of. I have been prescribed Ambien for sleep and Nuerontin for the pain. which do not work as well as Lortab and Klonopin. I really don't know who to turn to anymore to get my life back in order..being functional in everyday life, like cleaning my surroundings and me as well as going to work. I just can't work. When I get up to get dressed I go into a panic and just liked before any anti-depressant feel tired and go back to sleep. if anyone can help either find a doctor or guide me better on this med I would appreciate it.Does this site have an email address place for people to respond?

I would wake up early in the morning feeling horribly nervous. This subsided, then the second week I felt on edge. Like, just on the verge of having a panic attack and I actually had a few. I was also prescribed Xanax 0.5 mg to take as needed. This really helped me get through the first month while started Zoloft. I have now been on 100 mg for about a month. I am FINALLY feeling good.

First few months were rough, lots of headaches seemed to be the biggest side effect for me. Some sleep issues, along with vision being blurry and shakes added to the fun.  I am past the mass panic at this point and have recently tried to cut out the clonazapam. Not going to great due to the fact that they increased the Zoloft from 100mgs to 200mgs to offset the clonazapam. I believe that 200mgs is too much for my system. I am now having side effects I did not have to begin with since the increase and need to really sit down with my caregiver on this one.  I have researched Zoloft and gathered as much information as possable from Drs. with no real reason for this to be happening other than the problem being the increased dosage. This medication of course will work for some and not for others, body chemistry really is the defining factor. Keep that in mind, I would recommend this for those who have a high tolerance towards side effects and alot of patients!  As you can see by my rating, Im not out of the woods yet, but Im working on it!  Hope this can help some of you!

I had terrifying nightmares about death and my worst fears, it was very scary and nobody had believed it. Im getting better step by step after making a desicion personally to stop my use of Zoloft.

2360$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/26/2008 11:44:44 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I began to experience panic attacks a few years ago that felt like I was having a heart attack.  I was prescribed Zoloft to try and it has been a life saver.  After the initial week of getting used to the drug I found that my attacks have completely stopped and I can actually sleep at night.  I did experience a gradual weight gain my first round but on my second I have been losing weight.  A good part of this is due to exercise and diet.  There are side effects but very small.  The most prominent one is probably the loss of extreme emotions that I used to feel.  I feel very much contained and it's not too bad.  I would rather have limits on my emotions than to go back having severe panic attacks.  I cannot thank Zoloft enough.  I had been off it for 5 months and weaned just fine, but realized that the stress in my life got to be too much.

I was losing my patience with my children, my husband and just generally not happy with life.  I went to my doctor and after him listening to me practically blubber like an idiot for a while, he told me that I was over stressed.  I did not want to go on an anti depressant, but he asked em to try it for 60 days.  Well, now 4 weeks into my medication therapy, I am so thankful that I did!  I feel like a new person.  I have my energy level back, my patience are so much better, and I fee like I am back to my old self.  I never thought that a ""pill"" could make such a difference.  I want to get off of this medication as soon as possible and hopefully, this will be possible in just a short time.  Overall, I have had no side effects, and I think that my sex drive has actually INCREASED!!  Maybe this is because I just feel better...who knows.   "

After a good friend died, I was anxious and depressed, losing weight and just unable to be me. I strated taking Zoloft and it has bettered all of my symptoms. Aside from night sweats, decreased sexual appetite and dizziness if i dont take it, it has been wonderful.
I now function normally and feel like myself again.

I've been on Zoloft for 2 months and i did notice some restless nights at first but have no trouble now. 
I am on a low dose but after a couple weeks i did notice that things were not as upsetting to me and seemed happier. 
Three weeks ago my father died suddenly and if not for the medications i was already on i think my depression would have had a devastating effect on me. 
I did notice that if i didnt take my zoloft for 3 days i had a sudden change in mood. I thought that by being more stable in my life i wouldnt need the Zoloft but i couldnt explain the sudden mood change to depressing thoughts. I immediately took the Zoloft that night and have felt ok since. 

As for the loss of sex drive, i think i have noticed a change but i have a wonderful relationship now and we still have regular sex although i do notice it is difficult for me to achieve an orgasm. 

At first i was afraid to take Zoloft from all the reviews i read but now i am grateful for it. It has definitely helped me thru a very rough time in my life.

Another good thing is that zoloft doesn't completely kill my personality like welbutrin and prosac did.

2546$Condition: Depression$10/29/2007 5:32:00 PM$Reviewer: Cassidy , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I know many people have to try several different anti-depressants before one worked for them. I was lucky because Zoloft was the first medication prescribed to me after my first severe depressive episode and in less than two weeks I was thinking clearer and more rational than I ever had. Actually, I like to say I felt like the person I really am and not the person who couldn't control their negative, self deprecating thoughts. Because I have a family history of depression and chemical imbalance I've stayed on Zoloft indefinitely (10 years now). When I've tried to go off, within weeks I can feel the depressive thoughts sneaking back. One thing I would say to someone who needs an antidepressant - it does not work overnight, but takes time to build up in your body to do what it is intended to do to make you feel better.

I'm a nurse and work in a fast paced environment so I thought maybe I was just stressed out at work.  I called my doctor and requested to use this med.  After four days of using it, I stopped.  The side effects were awful, I was tired, irritable, and just couldn't function at work.  My body had a strange tingling feeling and I felt like I could urinate my pants at anytime. These side effects pushed my anxiety over the edge.  
2571$Condition: Depression$10/26/2007 1:01:53 PM$Reviewer: $4$4$5$"After reading previous reviews, I certainly can see we all have different metabolisms--thats why it's important to have a trustworthy and competent dr. overseeing ones treatment. A chemical imbalance is ultimately responsible for a lot of our symptoms. Apprehension about seeking help is our 1st hurdle. We shouldn't let a bad experience with any (1) drug or type of drug deter us from finding relief.  I myself, need to change my medication usually annually. (apparently I build up a tolerance). As I sense it happening, I freely and openly discuss with my personal physician and we either have tried a different med. or upped dosage at times. Over the last 8yrs. we have found that going back and forth between Paxil and Zoloft works best for my metabolism. Prozac and Climadyn weren't well tolerated (got worse).  
So, in conclusion, I like to say don't give up--you don't have to live life being depressed, anxious etc.. but it may take a few tries to find what chemical may be active, inactive, overactive in your system. 
KISS - KEEP IT(life) SIMPLE SWEETY!   p.s. someday our dna will enable us to quickly and absolutely know what our bodies are in need of, in excess of, etc.. until then its trial and error, and my dr. I've chosen to trust.  My own knowledge isn't always enough.  Again seek help if you are having depression, anxiety or other problems -- the answer could be 1 appt. away. "

I have to take a very high dosage, and must take it regularly without ever missing a dose for it to work on a continuous basis.  I've been lax, at times, in my treatment, and it can take up to six to eight weeks to rebuild the chemicals in my systom to be therapeudic again.  This can be a miserable time; therefore, I try diligently to take this medication without interuption.  It is extremely effective on my OCD, and Anxiety.  It has all but eliminated my Panic Attacks, although, it hasn't totally eradicated them.  My best experience, I must reiterate, is the persistent continuity of regular medication dosaging of Sertraline along with any other prescribed medications.

2631$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/28/2007 5:34:51 PM$Reviewer: JasonK, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"Back in 1994, only ONE PILL of Zoloft created a 3-day living nightmare for me.  First hour: onset of tremors and fear. Second hour: nausea, panic. By the fourth hour, (I was 19 at the time) I was staying at my father's home.  I couldn't sleep. Roughly around midnight, something snapped in my head. I lost my sense of identity. I didn't know who I was, where I was, etc.  I used logic to get help:  Assuming I was in a living room with a TV on and it was midnight, the owner(s) of the house would most likely be upstairs sleeping.  I went to the first door (luckily my father's bedroom) and knocked.  When he answered, I distinctly remember saying, ""Excuse me Sir, but I don't know who I am, where I am, or how I got here, but I'm scared.""

Immediately he got up, took me down to the living room and he tried talking to me.  By 6am, I started shaking and couldn't stop touching my face/forehead/head (sense of connectivity through anxiety situations).  Father called hospital and doctor. They said there was nothing to do but stop any further usage, and wait it out.

By 9am, I regained my identity, but had horrible diarhea and tremors and panic.

That morning and afternoon, I felt I would never feel happiness again and said, ""Now I understand why people commit suicide. If they felt like they would never feel another moment of happiness again, it makes sense.""

I distinctly remember I asked if I could have a box of Kleenex and sit on the front porch (summertime) and I cried unexplainably for 6 HOURS NON-STOP!

It took 3 days before I felt it was out of my system. I felt as though certain ""doors inside the innermost parts of my brain were unlocked and opened; doors that were never meant to be opened. Ever.""

I've never been the same since that paradoxical reaction from that ONE SINGLE PILL.  I never will willingly take an anti-depressant again.

My treatment for GAD since 1995 has been Librium when I wake up and Propranolol (for its beta-blocking properties) 20mg every 4 or 5 hours."

However, when I have forgotten to take it or didn't get it refilled, the withdrawal symptoms (light-headed, dizziness, anxiety...) can be pretty  difficult to deal with.

The plus side of that was that I actually lost weight while taking Zoloft.   Also, I didn't have any less interest in sex, but I did have a harder time reaching orgasm.

BUT I was wondering if anyone had weight gain while on it. I know I have and I am looking for something else that does not give me weight gain.
