1$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/23/2019 10:12:18 AM$Reviewer: ron, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $2$1$2$"was on lithium and Geodon, Seroquel worked but not well, doctor kept increasing despite increasing severely dangerous side effects, (rapidly increasing blood sugar, very rapid hypertriglyceridemia, and 12-14 hrs of sleep need. Geodon worked better than seriquil, but after 2 months I could not get more than 2 hours of sleep, and was so tired I cried all night. So my new doctor put me on Risperdal.(uh, hello work the same way) stupid me thought the doctor new best. In the mean time I was having mild sexual side effects that didn't bother me in the least, but I was having muscle weakness too. my doctor tested my testosterone and it was dropping. I then spent the next to years constantly increasing testosterone (which is very had to get and keep getting, but Viagra, that's super easy despite not a single symptom Viagra treats) sexual side effects became a huge problem but no American resource mentions a thing. I asked my doctor, and said problems started on lithium, and got worse with Risperdal and my testosterone was dropping like a rock. My ""doctor"" then told me it wasn't the drugs, increased BOTH, then proceeded to test each and every one of the hormones Risperdal effects. she said prolactin was high but nothing to worry about. The depression from not being able to preform was devastating, and if I had known this was the cause, I would probably not been. * years of Risperdal and lithium later, Risperdal became very unstable very quick. I got a new doctor, and he took me of both and prescribed Limital, and told me What Risperdal does. I spent two months in Hell, coming off these drugs and flooded with emotions. I did not notice how much of a zombie I'd been for 15 years because of medications. AFTER I got off Risperdal, every doctor tells me it is bad news"

The positive part is that I do not have those strange hallucinatory thoughts anymore so I will give this medication a 10/10 for effectiveness; however, it makes me extremely tired and for that I canâ??t stand it. I am in a permanent sedentary position because the side effects outweigh the positives and that is disturbing! I canâ??t work or study due to the uncomfortable feeling it gives me.

They gave me a cup with risperdal and told me that it will help me sleep. I gained alot od weight and developed minor gynecomasita that still remained when I was 15 years old and lost all of the weight. Im in my 30s now and my other doctor said I had minor gynecomastia and recommended a ultrasound and mammogram but because the gynecomastia wasn't cancerous insurance wouldn't cover the breast glandular tissue removal. The Canadian Government should pay for it or recommend that I stop taking all antipsychotics which I have been taking for almost 2 decades
8$Condition: Other$1/21/2018 5:18:05 PM$Reviewer: Rob from New York, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$1$2$After taking this for 20 years and realizing at least the last 10 years i've been having bad hard to troubleshoot headaches, it became evident -- eventually -- that risperdal was the source of the headaches.  I think for a lot of people the reason it works is that it inflicts pain and when you're focused on the pain you can't argue or defend yourself.  The thing is, this medicine did nothing to remove or reduce hallucinations or delusions, I was having them when i had them regardless of dose (I've taken anywhere from 1-6mg/day), I was just busy focusing on the pain so didn't complain as much about the other symptoms.

I am pretty much on it as both an extra OCD med and an extra med for my major recurrent depression. I also have general anxiety disorder and mood disorder and stress because of everything going on in my life right now. I started out on 1 mg and am now on 4. When I was on 3mg I was having really, really bad thoughts and had a really scary time that scared both my parents and me. I think it had a lot to do with the fact that I had a really serious disease where I've lost two jobs in the past 3 years, have had to move back in with them to take care of me, am going to have to get all new doctors, including a new specialist in my disease at the beginning of next year, and get new insurance so some medications I'm on now I will have to get on new ones or have quanity limits. Since they have upped my dose to 4 mgs, I'm not thrilled, but I'm much more able to deal with things and maintain control of myself and at least look at solutions instead of being just so upset I couldn't even do anything but freak out about everything going around.

It works very well for both. I'm on 3 mg and take it at night before bedtime. It helps my mind not race while I'm trying to get to sleep so I can actually sleep now without my mind worrying about a million things that I can't control. I still have anxiety; I'm just wired that way, but it definitely cuts way back on it. It's definitely helped me. I've never had the weight gain from this drug some people talk about. Knock on wood.

I was also prescribed Paxil and Klonopin too, for anxiety. My disorganized, paranoid thoughts pretty much disappeared! OCD was way better too. Then, after about 3.5 years of treatment with Risperdal, I developed a severe bladder problem, in which I had no control over my bladder. I wet the bed every single night. It really was a huge disruption in my life. This is when my Medicaid plan went to a generic(However, I'm not so sure the generic was the problem). One thing was, on the name brand, I did extremely well! As soon as I went to the generic, my bladder, and my mental state sunk again! I do not know if this has anything to do with the brand vs. generic though. However, I recently stopped taking Risperidone, and I am not at all wetting the bed anymore! Itching ceased as well. Also, Risperidone made my feel the inner restlessness(Akathesia) where I would go nuts upon taking it. Good effectiveness, horrible, nasty, side effects!!! Nearly impossible to take for me, anyway. Try to, maybe even ask for an older antipsychotic, Typical type. This stuff worked well and then turned me into a bed wetting maniac, all hopped up, all day long!

27$Condition: Other$4/8/2015 10:12:19 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$4$The drug worked well for the psychotic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. The main problem was my breasts (and any area that had fat depositson my body) became very sensitive and tender and sore. Maybe a bit weird, but then I started lactating and I decided to try something else. Sad actually-- because the psychotic symptoms went away at a relatively low dose.
28$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$3/20/2015 2:59:19 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication is the one that worked best for me. I have had bipolar episodes for years. Just recently, I began experiencing somatic symptoms and severe panic attacks. The Risperdal helped me control the unwanted thoughts that I had a terminal illness, helped ease the somatic symptoms I am experiencing (somatic meaning unwanted feelings such as tingiling in head, twitching, head rushes, and so forth). Everything I have is contributed to mania. The Risperdal helped ease all of these horrible symptoms almost immediately and is starting to help me get my life back and improve my overall quality of life. I was so scared by these unwanted health concerns and feelings that I almost went mad and had no pleasure or enjoyment in anything. I would just worry something was horrifically wrong with me. I do still get the night attacks right before falling asleep but it is getting much better. I have experienced some minor side effects: muscle stiffness, increased reflexes, which may still contribute to my somatic disorder but they can be side effects (minor) from Risperdal. Do expect to gain some weight and be extremely tired but the tiredness does pass once you let the Risperdal work its way into your system and do its job. Please do read all of the side effects as all medications work differently on different people. If you have dementia or have QT syndrome or any other heart problem DO NOT take this medication. All I can advise is just tell your doctor your history of medical problems, like all medications, be careful. For myself, Risperdal has saved my mental well being and has drastically improved my quality of life and happiness.

34$Condition: Other$10/25/2014 3:40:07 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) $1$1$1$This medication was given to my mother after my sister moved in with her with her adult son, one that my mother did not want in her home because he had stolen from her. When she could not get him out of her home she began showing severe anger about it and she and my sister were fighting about it everyday. My sister took her to a doctor that specialized in dementia but instead of telling the truth why my mother's anger and behavior was so out of control, this doctor, who had never seen or treated my mother before,prescribed this medication. This medicine completely changed my mother from an active person to a bedridden person that had to be taken care of like a baby. She refused or wasn't able to function as a normal person. When another sister and I got involved and learned of the medicine she was being given we told my sister to stop giving it to her, which she did and my mother returned to her old self but with the same problems, the anger over my nephew living in her home, so the arguments started again and my sister, to keep my mother in a vegatated state put her back on it and that was the beginning of the end of my mother's life. My sister and I tried getting guardianship over my mother but with all the red tape and lack of money to fight it in court we had to give it up. So after a time it took its toll and only months after giving up the fight for guardianship my mother passed away and I know this medication and my sister is what caused her death!!!

Currently on Effexor SR with some relief.  My doctor added Risperdal to help.  I felt absolutely WONDERFUL...I felt like my old self emotionally.  My husband even noticed the change because I had more energy, bounce in my step. It also lessened my anxiety. Unfortunately, I developed breast milk within 2 days of starting the medication, my breast doubled in size, was constantly hungry (gained five lbs within a week), and developed very embarrassing drooling.  I went off the medication and the side effects stopped.  But I'm back to how I was before I started taking this.  I truly wish I could have tolerated the side effects.

He started on .5 mg twice a day and within 3 weeks it had kicked in. He was very sedated and his appetite had increased within the first few weeks, but 7 mths on what a different person.! He hasnt once been anxious, there have been no incidents with him, what a turnaround.? However, after the 7 mths of being on this medication he has taken a dip where many of his traits have returned, he is displaying the things he used to do before taking respiridone and the anxiety is back, i actually thought he had become resistant to it as he was being violent again. The doctor said this can happen whilst on this medication so it has been increased to 4mg a day its only been a week since hes been on the increased dose and the sedation has returned with lack of interest with activities, he sometimes looks a little vacant and delays in doing things or answering you, i do believe in repiridone though as it worked for my son for 7 mths.

Risperdal didn't stop them at once, but after some years, they dissapeared completly. The medication made me less intelligent, sleepy to an extrem, slow, happy (but my life was empty), fearless and i gained 15 kg and got pimples. i have slept 20 hours a day for the first month, 10 in the end. my body was numb, climbing stairs felt like climbing a mountain. having a body that needs exercise every day, i felt shit with the sudden change. before, i was one of the very good looking people, but now i got rejection after rejection, because i couldn't get the good looking boys anymore. that did not help me to feel better. before, i was a highly intelligent person, now i was slow. my power was taken. people liked me like they like cows. beeing a very ambitious person, everything was taken from me and something broke in me forever. who knew me before, thought i would make it and have a career. now, i was in a chemical straighjacket. i believe, that i could have got over the halucinations without risperdal. it is about staying in your body and dominating your space.

I would not recommend this drug to anyone. The therapist who prescribed it to me, Dr. Katherine Watkins from Rand, would not even give me a diagnosis. She said that I had to keep taking this but would not give me a reason. I asked her several times regarding the side effects and she would not disclose them to me. If I didn't know better, I'd think that some doctors just prescribe it to see what will happen to their patients. It must be some sick form of ""research"" because they obviously don't care that the benefits of prescribing this seem to HARDLY EVER outweigh the side effects. "

It makes mental acuity at awaking in the morning next to impossible.  I have taken three mg of this per day for eleven years and finally am tapering off due to the ill effects.
Further I have made great strides to improve my physique and will not watch this 'wonder drug' slow my metabolism so I can gain excess weight.  I am not sure if this medication is intended for anyone aside from infants who cry too much.
Further still, depression and anxiety are maintained by the over-identification with the disorder and being sedated so you sit and stew is definitely NOT what you need to be doing."

My wife and daughter had noticed a scary change in my personality once I left the intensive care/ hospital stay and was at the rehab center. Upon checking she found out the attending doctor was prescribing Risperdal and decided to research it on the web. She was shocked and scared to find her results and immediately went to see the doctor telling him she wanted her husband off of this medication. The doctor refused until she said I was a member of AA and had a strong background in abuse of chemicals ( alcohol) 20 years before. He told her he took me off of it but she found the papers recently stating he never had during my two week stay. I believe this horrible drug caused psychosis in me while I was there and also was the culprit for my loss of taste and smell. I do remember being able to taste food when I first got to the hospital but never again after that. It is in my opinion the wrong drug to give to a patient with a serious head injury as they are already fighting to deal with brain issues. This was 13 years ago and I have never recovered my sense of smell or taste.

The only problem that I seem to be having is that my emotions are so much stronger than they have been in many years.  I do not know if this is a side effect or if it is due to the fact that I have hardly felt any emotions at all in so many years.  I actually have strong feelings of sadness and happiness (and I even smile or laugh on occasion now)but I am also having a lot of anger issues since about a week after starting the medication.  At first I thought that the anger I was feeling was situational but as I continue to take it the anger is getting out of control to the point that if something falls off of my computer stand or I have difficulties doing an easy task, I will actually cuss out loud which is something I have not done in many years.  I did, however, go from eating next to nothing to having a healthy appetite and maybe at times eating a bit too much.  My anger issues are the biggest problem I am having since being on this medication and I have tried many coping strategies in order to deal with it.  I was hoping that by posting my experience on WebMD that I could possibly find out if any other people have had anger issues while taking Risperidone.  I would greatly appreciate any and all suggestions to make this issue go away.  If you do have any ideas that could possibly help then please e-mail me at [email protected] as I hardly ever go on the WebMD site.

I first thought, and even now, is that it works well for my symptoms. The thing that happened to me was that I always had a high prolactin level. My periods started to slowly disappear. I would have it one month then not have it for 3. I was only 24 when I started. Then eventually my periods went away for 4 and a half years. I was thrilled that the medication was making me not menstruate since I didnt want anymore children. But after 4 and a half years without a period, abnormal cells began to grow in the uterus. I ended up having endometrial cancer, (uterine cancer) from the mix of hormones that the drug was giving me. After my radical hysterectomy  I went into menopause at 32 years old. Even now, after almost a year after surgery I still am leaking breast milk from the medication. I believe that if you are a woman on this drug, watch your hormones and periods carefully.

After trials of Seroquel,Trazadone and Depacote there was no improvement.  She now is on a low dose of Risperdal at the nursing home with no change. She has been physically healthy and on eyedrops only. I feel since it is not recommended for elderly dementia and has life threatening side effects, that she should not be given this medication.  She was walking before this medication but now is unable to without falling.  Her aggression is only during these times and I feel that it is because she is confused and afraid.  It ceases when the intervention is complete.  There is no psychiatrist ordering this medication or appropriate blood work monitoring.  Even though I am her daughter and legal guardian the nursing home will not get it discontinued by her family physician. I worry that continuing it will hasten her death.

At first when I took this medication I was hospitalized for drug induced psychosis. I was extremely deluded, spoke in word salads, extremely paranoid.  My brain twisted words spoken by people into words of extremely negative and harsh words constantly criticizing me and that made me depressed, angry and violent.  I wouldn't hear voices without people talking; like if I went to a quiet place I wouldn't hear any voices.

[Effects]

When I first started this medicine I was like a zombie-still am-and it affected my cognitive ability to the point that I had to relearn certain things.  During the first week of taking the medicine I would have frequent panic attacks in which my breathing would be strange and I had difficulty swallowing my saliva.  I had never had panic attacks before taking this medication. Risperdal seemed to shift my anxiety and fear from social phobia into panic attacks.

[Conclusion]

Apart from the side-effects of being: a zombie, impaired cognitive ability, weight gain, bigger chest fat around nipples(wtf), sensitivity to temperature, inhibited my speech to the point people think I'm autistic maybe due the drug's blocking of the serotonin receptor; I would say this drug has helped me blend back into society and has given me an opportunity to go to school and pursue a career at the same time.

tips

Exercise of 30 min per day helps, living with a caring family helps, socializing with friends that don't drink, do drugs or do criminal or dangerous activities helps too. Going back to school or getting a job helps as well. Good luck."

con: i gained weight, lactated, laziness, i did not really have a motive for anything. the worst thing about this drug though, was the fact that i felt like i had no feeling, coming from before being anxious and having too many thoughts and fears to having any makes you seem lifeless, it was good for overcoming my extremely bad anxiety, but once i got off the medication i got anxiety, it has however gone down."

109$Condition: Other$4/7/2012 7:34:02 PM$Reviewer: justice1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$Having been married for 26 years to someone with severe mental illness and addiction problems that I did not realize the extent of, (having been so close to this person), a transferrance of emotion, (from my ex to me), occurred while going through an unwanted divorce. All I desired was to see my ex stable for once in her life and I allowed myself to be talked into seeking help for myself, (hoping to set an example), when it was her who desperately needed it. The psychiatrist believed the stories fabricated by my ex and treated me with Risperdal. This drug is dangerous when it is not needed. I hallucinated, drooled, had high and low mood swings, heart palpitations, etc. and it made me feel so high, then low, that I literally wanted to kill myself. At times I felt so high, I felt invincible. I had the sense to realize that something was dangerously wrong here. Having the sense to stop the medication shortly after starting it, (within a couple of months), because of the dangerous side effects I was feeling, what was most unbelievable even to this day, was the idea that another human being, (the psychiatrist), could use someone like a guinea pig and drug them into oblivion while under their care. Thank God I am 6 years out of this predicament but the emotional triggers that were inserted into me while in the hospital are as real as if they happened yesterday. Every day is a struggle to maintain my perspective and realization that when medical mistakes are made and not acknowledged, people can die. Had I did decide to take my life while drugged, the psychiatrist would have been validated and I would have been considered the nut. Psychiatry is a dangerous business. I have not only reported this to MedWatch but also to my local, State of CT Practicioner's Licensing and Investigations Board, The Attorney General, as well as other authorities, all to no avail. I do not wish what happened to me on anyone. All the systems do is protect each other at all costs. This is immoral.

111$Condition: Other$3/29/2012 2:36:16 AM$Reviewer: Lisa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$After suffering from depression since childhood and taking nearly all brands of antidepressants, which were not effective, I was diagnosed with chronic major depression. Initially the psychiatrist put me on Olanzapine, which helped with the depression, but the major side effects of this drug were weight gain of 60 lbs. in six months and sleeping 14-16 hours per day.  Now that I am on .5mg of Risperdal my life has changed.  My mood has improved immensely, though my anxiety has increased slightly. I have lost 20 lbs. in 4 months.  However, my hypersomnia has turned into insomnia, but at least I am able to get things done.  Other adverse effects are confusion, inability to concentrate and bladder problems.  As I was able to retire early, some of these side effects will not destroy my life as the depression did, though I would not recommend this drug to someone with depression who is under 50 or over 70 unless many other alternatives have been tested.  Everyone reacts differently to medication, but my recommendation would be to start at the very minimum dosage and slowly work your way up if need be to avoid serious side effects as much as possible. My major concern with this drug are the long-term side effects.

I had a twitch in my lip that wouldn't not go away. I told me doctor and she had me stop taking the risperdal and told me to start taking seroquel which I did not. I had UNBELIEVABLE side effects I stopped eating, started smoking again and would not leave my home or drive my car, my personality completely changed to a fun-loving person to some kind of mental case.   I was super paranoid and had unreal panic attacks.  Finally it all ended with a seizure (never had one in my life or history of seizures in my family)that put me on deaths door step. My daugther found me on my kitchen floor she thought I was dead. I fractured my right shoulder from the fall that had to be completely replace and I need additional surgery.  I was hospitalized from 10/29/11 to 12/31/11 and was in a rehab because my right side had also become paralyzed.  I believe with my whole heart and soul that risperdal did this to me.  I am now on 10 different pills including Keppra,seroquel, a multitude of vitamins, high blood pressure meds, pain meds and klonapin.  I was 45 minutes away from death..I have my ex-doctor to thank for this life changing experience and risperdal.  Be careful when taking this medication and never, ever just stop taking it you have to be weened...

Never mind the fact that anyone in my situation would have been irritable, not least of all because my father had just died, I could not get any emotional support, and I had been repressing all anger and irritation for five years previously.  Instead of teaching me to be more assertive, let's just make the emotions go away, right??

Well anyway.  On 1-2 mg, I slept constantly, had such pain in my hips, shoulders, and pectoral muscles that I could not walk or lift my kids, and could not think clearly enough to do simple household chores without someone to remind me of each step.  

I had all the negative emotions-- in fact my depression worsened until I became suicidal-- but my therapists thought everything was great because I appeared calm due to having no ability to think clearly enough to express what I was feeling.  

All in all a horrible drug.  Unless someone is very violent, I would not even consider Risperdal for treatment.  "

I have severe muscle cramping, joint pain, and burning sensation in the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet. It is has become difficult to empty my bladder..start, and then it's slow. The joint and muscle pain is targeted mainly to both hands and arms. My hands are also stiff.  The burning sensation stopped after discontinuation The cramping eased as well, after a few weeks, but the rest of the symptoms continue and are progressing! I also was lactating, but that stopped after discontinuation after about a week. I have been left 7 months later after total discontinuation of max dose of 1mg of Risperdone with hands and wrists stiff and sore, 24/7, cramping easily, feet that cramp, wake up easily, anxiety, the same bladder troubles, sensitive to other med side affects, and more! Just too painful to type any more! DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! Requires four 7.5mg of hydrocodone per day and 24 hour lodocian patches on hands and wrists plus tylenol to keep pain under control.

Recently, I read up online and found out that Risperdal can affect hormones, menstrual cycles, and brain tissue. I have galactorea (breast milk) from it, my hair has almost ceased growing on my body, and the hair on my head is thinner. When I started taking Risperdal I was 130 lbs., now I'm 220; and if anything my eating has gotten better. It makes me hungry. I have been taking birth control for 5 years, and nothing's ever been different.. but now that I've been on Risperdal for 2ish years, it has significantly slowed down. I take Effexor XR for depression/panic attacks, Lithium/mood stabilizer, and Risperdal for anger and manic episodes. I have tried Geodon, Abilify, Saphris, & many others. None of them have been as effective as Risperdal, but the side effects of it are killer. I am going to try Latuda and Saphris again because I didn't truly give Saphris a chance. Good luck

I am bipolar.  I questioned the doctor as I don't respond well to many drugs.  (I take Cymbalta and Lamictal with no horrible problems).  He assured me they didn't see side effects with this med unless someone was taking 9ms or more.  I took .50mgs for only 2 days and woke up with a charley horse in my left leg that wouldn't go away. My tongue, head, neck, arms and legs were moving involuntarily. I had had two inch long blood filled places on my legs, similar, but smaller sores in my mouth. I couldn't be understood when I spoke and had a rapid heart rate.  I ended up in the ER.  They gave me something to calm my muscles down and told me I should be back to normal withing 24-48 hours.  I saw my own Psychiatrist the following day; he told me it would be longer as my pupils were still huge.  19 days I suffered with those side effects before they wore off.  My doctor was ticked that it was even prescribed for me, as it is an older drug, not used as much for bipolars because there are others that work better with fewer side effects.  I now have it listed as a drug I am allergic to.  I wouldn't recommend anyone take this without trying everything else first!

I started this around Thanksgiving and at 1st it worked well towards my aggressive feelings towards my hard to get a long with mother in law, but needed to have the 4 mg. dose lowered due to feeling just BLAAAAA. No feelings whatsoever towards her or doing anything. Then that feeling soon changed and we upped the dose back to the original prescription again because the blaas went away and I didn't want to feel aggressive again as I'm not normally an aggressive person whatsoever, not ever. Then I started feeling anxious all the time from it,like on speed. As soon as I was taken off of it the other day and put on Seroquel, I could feel an almost instant change and a lot more mellow now. I HATE IT. It also gave me the 'munchies' all the time, which is bad because I had bariatric surgery back in 2006. I've been blessed so far in that Seroquel, so far, hasn't done this yet.

It never seemed to be doing much for him. He has also been on Zoloft for the past 9 months. His diagnosis is PDD he also has mental retardation. He is 14.

I started to see his hand curling at the wrist and he started to hold his hands and arms curled up to his head. I was totally freaked out! He is non-verbal so he could never tell me what he was feeling. It turns out he was having a side effect called Tardive Dyskinesia. It is a serious condition and can become permanent.

He is almost off this drug, but I can tell you I would never put my child on this medication ever. What expressive language he had (making lots of sounds, being vocal and clapping when happy) had disappeared. It is all coming back now that he is almost off this medication. A horrible drug!!!"

The doctors did not take time to review my symptoms when I was admitted, so I was put on the drug almost immediately after admittance.
As it turned out, I had severe OCD and moderate mood issues, NOT schizophrenia as they had thought.
After being put on another medication, the Risperdal was STILL not working.
2 years later, I started going to a different psychiatrist, and he FINALLY got me off the drug.
The problem was now, not my condition, but my weight. I had always been underweight, but during the 2005-2006 school year, I nearly doubled my weight, going from 65lbs to 120.
I was bullied because of my weight, and eventually it got so bad that I was homeschooled from late 2006-mid 2009.
5 years later, I am a freshman (back in the public school system) and still have not recovered from the side affects of Risperdal,I am now almost 140 lbs.
This drug did not work for me, and (even if they did have schizophrenia) I wouldn't wish this medication on ANYONE, even my worst enemy."

I'm 5""4 and weigh approximately 128 lbs.  This drug helps me to manage my sometimes uncontrollable emotions extremely well.  I have recently had some manic episodes, though.  I am going through a very difficult time in my life right now (separating from my husband of 18 years), and I would not dare stop taking my meds!  My doctor also prescribed Ativan for anxiety attacks-but I rarely need to take one.  Risperdal, for me, has been a God-send.

I have always had times where I have, you could say, went crazy.  I have had extreme highs and extreme lows.  In a rage I stuck a steak knife in my chest twice.  Then was hospitalized.  There they put me on this medication.  At first I thought it was helping wonderfully.  After about 6 months I began to hate myself on it.  I never had any emotion.  No happiness, no sadness, and no anger.  All are vital to being a human being, as long as none are extreme.  I decided to quit cold turkey.  Did not take long till I was losing my mind, literally.  At the time I had no idea why, I just thought I must really be crazy and need this medicine.  Then I would take it again.  Then of course quit.  I spent another 6 months trying to live a normal life.  I don't remember most of this time.  It is time I will never get back.  I just know that if ever I really wanted to die it was this time.  My brain was screaming at me daily, hourly, minutely, and every second.  No one including doctors understood what was wrong with me.  It was a nitemare.  To put anyone through any of this is horrible.  To be on it was horrible.  The dreams, the no emotion, the not wanting to live.  Still every show that I watched when I was on this, when they come on I get the most horrific feeling when they come on.  The side effects to using this will never, I do believe, completely go away.  I would rather be dead than be on this.  That is coming from the heart.  Please make sure you or your loved one is in dyer need of this before taking.  It will ruin yours and those around you's life.

Risperdal is the only one that worked to relieve my bipolar mania symptoms, namely hearing voices, being paranoid and having anxiety all the time. The only downside is I gained over 60 pounds. I was already obese to begin with so gaining so much weigh has just put a huge burden on me. Also I have trouble losing weight but I'm not sure that it's the Risperdal that is causing it. Oh, I finally ended up on 6mg. That's a relatively high dose for someone with bipolar but I do have a severe form of it.

At first it worked great but after about 3 weeks we noticed it wasn't working as well. So the Dr upped her dose and again for a few weeks it was great. She has PDD-NOS and RAD. Now we are taking her off the the drug and trying Abilify...not sure if it will make a difference but hopefully it will work. I did notice it makes her tired but only sometimes and she used to sleep all night when she first started the drug but now she is coming into our room in the middle of the night again. She also has weight gain problems so they though this would work good to help her gain weight even though she eats more she has actually lost some weight since she started the medication so not sure what that is about she takes 2 mg a day of this and 15 mg of Buspar in addition. Not saying it is a bad drug or a good drug just make sure you keep an eye out for any changes that are unusual

Medicine, hospitalizations, therapy have saved my life.  I am currently taking Depakote and Nortripytline, but every day, without an antipsychotic, I am becoming sicker.  I called my doctor, and he will prescribe risperidone 2 mg bid tomorrow.  I cannot wait to get this medicine into my system.  I can feel that I am getting sick, I see it, but I cannot stop the symptoms from emerging.  I know in my heart or hearts that I need this medicine, as I have taken it before.
I just need it to re-enter my system.

In that time she went from a size 5 to a size 10 in clothing. She weighed 43 lbs before starting and currently is 56lbs. I keep her eating under control and always feed her healthy food. She cries because she is always hungry. I had to buy her size 10 pants and hem the legs 6 inches just so she can wear jeans. I am doing all I can to stop her from scratching her skin because she is getting stretch-marks. I cannot even lift her anymore she is so heavy. The bad part is, she is still gaining weight. She also has had an increase in Absence seizures as well. She is taking Lamictal for seizures, but it isn't working. The only reason she takes risperdal it is because the school cannot stand my child's manic behavior. My advise is to think what is more important, satisfying lazy teachers or putting your child through physical horror. I feel terrible about her being on this med. I wish there was a safer alternative for small children.

I wouldnt recommend this medication if your trying to get pregnant because when i was trying to get pregnant i could not which is really disapointing when your doctor tells your capable of concieving and its not happening.

I noticed a big difference twice when I ran out of the medication. BUT I also haven't had a period since Jan 09 -prior to starting the medication. I've seen OBGYN'S but they can't figure out why. I'm going to see another this week. But I did hear about and just now read the warning about the hormone problems it causes. It also took away my sex drive I believe. BC as I said I am now off the lithium and my other drugs are for blood pressure and I've been on them for a couple years. But I'm single now anyway so it doesn't matter.

I empathize with you wanting to end your child's suffering, as well as having a child that is 'easier' to deal with...but once you start a child on a life of 'popping pills' to cope...you are going down a very slippery slope. A child will learn very quickly they are now perceived as 'different' and labels can fast become self-fulfilling prophecies. Please please please parents, I am not writing this out of arrogance or indifference...I am writing this out of compassion, empathy and love...all I ask is that you take a deep breath, do some homework, even get a second opinion before you start jumping on the 'pill band wagon'. Sometimes these medications seem like 'wonder drugs'...but they can also make for short term gain and long term pain. If I reach just one person with my statement here, I will have made a positive difference in the live(s) of someone already struggling and dealing with hurt, suffering and pain. Bless each and everyone of you trying to do the best you can with little or no experience dealing with mental health (a continued 'taboo' issue even in the 21st century). As I said, I write this not out of malice, but from my heart as someone who has endured the stigma of mental illness plus experienced adverse life-threatening side effects to psychotropic drugs during my adolescence!!

Seeing no major differece, so we thought, we took him off after starting Kindergarten at age 6.  Mistake.  Within two months he was uncontrollable and worse than before.  He was suspended from Kindergarten for pulling out a peer's hair and deemed ""a threat to himself and others"".  We sought support at Children's Hospital immediately that day and put him back on it, increasing to .5mg/2x daily.  His performance, attention and social skills improved at school.  He has experienced no weight gain but does have a lack of energy.  Recently, due to a new escalation, he is up to .5mg/3x's daily and is in therapy.  He turns seven in a month.  We aren't where we want to be, but Risperdal certainly put us in the right direction.  Although too young to officially diagnose, he is being treated as early onset bipolar.  We also added Trazodone to his regime to help the nightmares and inability to sleep.  I regret fighting the medicinal route for him and encourage parents to hear out your pediatrician or psychiatrist before deciding AGAINST use of this medicine.

He couldn't speak, eyes rolled in the back of his head and every muscle from the neck up tightened up and he couldnt move. I do not recommend this medicine. The doctors said that these side effects only happen to about 2% of the people that take and thats adults and less than 1% in children. I guess my 5 year old was in that less than 1%.And all of this happened with in a day and a half of him taking it. Be careful when it comes to this medicine.Use it with extreme caution.

I am spiritually inclined, and my doctor was an Atheist. He made it very 'clear' to me that angels and god were fabrications, and false clutches, and there is no proof that my beliefs could be real. He also stated that imagination and faith are not healthy 'choices' in this world. I was suicidal at the time due to non-faith based problems, but pressures and events at that time of my life that built up to severe depression. But, he used his prejudice to diagnose me and ignored the real reasons I was in danger. I needed help for the events that happened to me, not medication for *one* sentence I uttered about prayer.  It sounds like a made-up story, I assure you it was not. This is an issue I have with the sector of psychology that assumes God is a mental illness. I am a colorful creative person, and he used his gray-stoicism to counter my beliefs, rather than help me. If you are indeed, schizophrenic or have dementia, this pill will work, since my great aunt took it for her dementia, and it helped. But if you are diagnosed WRONGLY this will make you even more depressed, despondent, zombie like, and coupled with prozac, I gained 55 lbs. I had a trainer and was on a diet, and still didn't lose the weight, which made me MORE depressed. It wasn't until I went to a new doctor 2 1/2 years later, that I was avenged. She saved me, told me I was GROSSLY misdiagnosed, and dangerously over-medicated. 
(he had me at full dose Prozac and 90% full dose Resp.) Nightmare. 

PLEASE PEOPLE. GET SECOND OPNIONS. It could save your life!! You are never 'married' to any doctor, regardless if they make you feel like they're the only one you should see. LEAVE THEM if you are doing everything correctly, and still are getting no results months later. "
263$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/7/2009 6:43:55 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I was diagnosed with Bi-polar and prescribed this drug. However, after stopping this drug, I have seen many doctors and all of them tell me it was a misdiagnoses because I do not have Bi-polar. However, while on this pill I gained over 100 pounds in less than six months (I was a size zero and now I am lucky to fit into a size 16). I can't say how well it helped my disorder since I did not have any disorder which would be treated by this drug. However, I can say, that it did affect my appetite and I was always hungry I did not eat much more than before, but I always wanted to and even without changing my diet I still more than doubled my weight. Now I have depression because of the side effects of this drug. While weight gain may not happen to everyone, talk to your doctor about other options especially if it is for a child who is under 18 since this drug effects weight in some people this could cause problems in mental and psychical health of children. If you have children who have doctors who are telling them to take it, I strongly recommend not doing so. I was  in high school while on this drug and I was made fun of daily for being fat which is all the worse when it was due to side effects of a drug. (I have been off this drug for three years and only lost 30 pounds so far so the side effects don't end when you are taken of this drug).

I could not do anything to keep her moods under control.  The doctor first put her on a medication for adhd which made her hear voices.  He then put her on risperdal and wow it has been heaven.  Her moods are way more under control and she is easier to handle.  She is on the .5 mg dose.  She helps out around the house and is nicer to everyone.  This medicine is a blessing for us.

At the time, it did help with disruptive behavior but mostly because it caused fatigue. My son gained almost 40 pounds, had breasts beginning to develop, and abnormal liver function tests. Whenever he was 16, last year, he suddenly developed abnormal liver enzymes which couldn't be attributed to anything else- every test short of biopsy was performed. And suddenly he started to gain weight- so much that he now has severe stretch marks. All of this happened 8 years after stopping the risperdal and returning to his pre-risperdal weight. I am very concerned about what even psychiatrists such as my son's previous pediatric psychiatrist are giving to kids. He is functioning much better on nothing but behavior modifications. He just graduated at 17 and made a 25 on the ACT. I'm just not sure of the long=term effects on children and I don't think anyone in the medical community truly is either.

She is on several meds for the OCD,which have been fairly effective, but the manic part of BPD was getting worse until we started Risperdal.  It has been very effictive for that purpose. The problem is that she has lost everything else in the side effects-She has experienced a healthy weight gain (40 lbs-which to a 105 lb woman is devestating), is very unstable on her legs and has fallen several times, can't concentrate on anything, increased prolactin levels, sleeps constantley and is depressed. I'm not sure if the side effects are worth it. Her life is miserable and at this point she is hardly more than existing. Is there anythnigs else?

The medication significantly reduced my hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and stuttering. But it did nothing to help my social anxiety/ impairment. The only side effects were weight gain. I started the medication at 165 and now after three years I'm at 220. Overall I think the medications very good, but I personally don't like the weight gain so may consider a different medication.

It helped to calm him down. However had to stop the anti-depressant after 3 months as the combination was making him hyper - he was on 3mg of Risperdal. 
After 4 months on risperdal, he started experiencing severe back pain with nausea and vomiting. Doctors did all sorts of tests on him to find the cause of the problem but none believed that Risperdal was causing the problem. I finally took him off it and the symptoms disappeared. However, after a week his aggressiveness returned. I put him back on risperdal but at a lower dose of 1.5 mg. His back pain and nausea returned. He is now on Abilify which so far seems to suit him better.

I did not have those happy highs, instead I had bouts of anger I could not control. One day I was screaming  at my 16 year old nephew, who never experienced this side of me, and I saw his eyes get big as he asked me why I was acting this way. I decided it was time to get help. A psychiatrist put me on wellbutrin for depression and 1 mg risperdal for anger. I read it was for schizophrenia and bulked at taking it because I know I do not suffer from it. My doctor confirmed I was not but asked me to trust his decision. I'm glad I did and wish I had taken this medication a long time ago. Initially there was some side effects of anxiety but was told to take benydryl to counteract it, which it did. It only lasted the first few days. My outlook is much different, my abnormal anger has subsided. I still get mad but its a normal emotion in response to normal situtations. I sleep through the night, I feel rested and not overly tired anymore, in fact I have more energy. I feel at peace and my family no longer has to walk on tiptoes around me. That is what I am most grateful for because as miserable as I felt, my family suffered more. I have had no wieght gain other than my normal fluctuations, I am geneticly large to begin. This medication has given me a new life.

It helped organize my thoughts, made me feel ""less undone."" It also cause me to *lactate.* That's right. I was told it was a rare side effect. However, upon reviewing these other reviews, I found another instance in less than 5 minutes, so I doubt that it's rare. This is a classic case of the cure being worse than the disease. I'm absolutely disgusted by the lack of proper information and the general lax response I received from the doctor who prescribed it. Something seriously disturbing is going on in the body for drug to make a non-pregnant woman to lactate. The only upside is that it has made me swear off psych medication. I am not a guinea pig. Further investigation should be done on this drug, esp. in light of kick-backs and extreme side-effects.  "

Attempted suicide 3 times.  In general this drug calms her down and help her sleep, she takes 1 mg/daily at night with prozac 10mg.  However, after a period of 4~5 months she'd start to complain of the side effects such as weight gain, short term memory loss, high blood sugar...etc and will begin to refuse the drug.  In the past my father and I have complied with her and let her skip the doses, and shortly after she'd relapse.  She's in one of those phase now, refusing the drug again complaining that she can't even remember when my sister got married (just recently).  We had to talk to her for an hr last night to get her take it.  We know this drug carry harmful side effects, but the consequence of not taking is too grave.  I really hope there are better drugs out there that'd help my mother, but right now Risperdal is all we have that helps.

He started this medicine and within 2 days he was amazingly better.  He is almost 7 and is on .5 mg twice per day.  If we skip a dose, it's obvious, as he's angry and irritable again.  When he's on it without missing a dose he is happy, loving, appropriately energetic, sleeps through the night.  He still has a full range of emotions and is very caring and loving and social.  It has made a tremendous difference to our family as things had gotten very bad and he had even talked about leaving the family and suicide a couple of times.  He was on a higher dose (just .5 mg more) and he started having trouble swallowing, so I took him off it for a week while we decided what to do.  All his psychological symptoms cam back within 2 days... His psychiatrist wants him to stay on it but I'm vigilant for any swallowing issues and I will give him Benedryl at the first sign of anything.  He has oral dyspraxia also so he already had difficultly with swallowing and breath control/cooridination, so it's hard to say if it's the Risperdal or not.  He has gained weight, 8 pounds so far, but we are trying to develop better eating habits!

Doctor at first thought meningitis and was ready to order a  Spinal tap until he looked up side effects of this drug. the side effects he experienced maybe rare but not worth the pain he experienced. after an injection of benadryl he became well and was released. suffice to say, he will no longer be taking this medication. he just started this treatment Friday as a mood stabalizer in conjunction with ADHD his ADHD med is DEXTROAMPHETAMINE (10mg once a day). ER doctor says its a 1 and 1000 chance side effect, unfortunately our lottery winning odds arent as good.

My first reaction to the diagnosis was that the doctor was crazy, not me, but it fit. My many, many nervous habits, motor ticks and even vocal ticks that I hadn't noticed, were all characteristics of Tourette's. The doctor started me on Risperdal, which I've been on for about two weeks now, and so far I've been really impressed by it. I take 1 mg at night, which allows me to sleep a full 8 hours!!! I also take 1/4 to 1/2 mg as needed throughout the day for anxiety, and I notice a difference in less than half an hour. Along with Zoloft and Wellbutrin, it’s worked great so far. However, I'm worried about the weight gain, which seems sort of popular with this medication -- I've never been bigger than a size 3, and I don't want that to change!

Thank God for the Risperdal. He rarely even gets angry anymore, and I'm no longer afraid to confront him if he's behaved negatively. However, the weight gain has been enormous. He's grown a lot height wise, but the weight gain isn't in proportion. He's an athlete, lifts weights 5 days a week and works out with his track team every day. The problem is he's now 300 pounds, at 6'5"", and he gained so much weight so fast he even has stretch marks on his waist, hips, under his arms, his shoulders, etc. His size is great for football, to a certain degree but not so much for basketball, as the extra weight really slows him down. He eats healthy, but enormous amounts of food. If not for the weight gain, this would be the perfect medication for him. Kids have started teasing him, even though he's a popular athlete at his high school. His success in school can only be attributed to being on Risperdal. We've had to gauge what's more important here, and since he was basically headed for a life of crime and juvenile detention centers followed most likely by life in adult prisons, we'll take the weight gain.

Risperdal was given to me at the onset of my illness, which was drug induced.  Although many people find Risperdal to be an efficacious drug, I found it very difficult to tolerate.  Perhaps it was because I was new to the whole schizophrenia thing, but I have had much better luck on Zyprexa (which is the best anti-psychotic on the market; it just has terrible side effects) and Abilify.  Risperdal made me emotionally numb; it detached me from myself and my experiences.  Additionally, it (like most of the anti-psychotics to some degree) caused me to gain some weight.  Overall, I would consider talking to your physician (and doing your own research) before starting Risperdal.  I think that you may find more pleasant alternatives, such as Abilify.  However, tolerance of anti-psychotic drugs is a very subjective experience, so Risperdal may be right for you.  But it was certainly not right for me.

I have looked up on the internet some side effects because I haven't been feeling well lately and noticed that I am experiencing quite a few of the side effects of risperdal. I am especially disgusted with my weight gain since I was always a size 10. I am 58 years old. I work full time but I am most of the time very tired. Three years ago I had my thyroid out and gained even more weight. I thought maybe I wasn't getting the right dosage of synthroid but my doctor did extensive blood work and could not find anything medically wrong with me. I am pretty sure that I am suffering from the side effects of the risperdal. I believe I had a brief psychotic disorder which brought on hallucinations when my husband ran off with my girlfried 15 years ago. My world had crashed and I was faced with keeping my house and had trouble keeping a job. So I was constantly faced with the possibility of losing my house under constant stress. My life is much better now. I am engaged and my 2 brothers live with me to help me financially with the house. I am wondering if I need this risperdal now. The side effects seem worse to me now.

He has been less angry and less violent.  He is very emotional though.  Instead of raging out, he cries more.  He definately has an increased appetite.  Overall, I would say that this is a very effective medication for him.

(along w/serzone) for treatment of seizures, depression & psychotic episodes. While the weight gain IS an issue-this has helped control his seizures & psychotic episodes which have been attributed to possible schizophrenia.   I can always tell when he's missed a dose because he will have a seizure or a hallucination or his speech becomes slurred & you can't understand his speech.

Although this is now used in a complete regime of other medications and therapy, I am pleased with how it works for him. It helps him to control his anger outbursts and helps to keep his emotions ""even"" through out the day. The ONLY bad thing we have experienced is weight gain, he has gained 20 lbs in one year. However, he is not considered obese or overweight, it is an issue for parents to keep an eye on."

She's been on it for 4 months now and seems to be doing better. Before risperdol she would cry before going to school, during school(up to 3 hours) and then if you would even mention going to school she was crying. Now she seems much happier. Doesn't cry about school.Not sure if it's the meds or that she finally realized she has to go to school every day even if she cries.
