In fact it is causing other issues....like I am super ill and snap with little control of myself. It doesn't just limit my talking... I don't want to talk at all.... and I don't want to hear anyone else talk either.... not even on tv. And I am suppose to take it 2 times a day....well the second time I can't even remember if I took it or not. And it doesn't help me focus.... instead I kind of zombie out and don't think at all... I just stare. It makes me ill and paranoid....I miss my adderall

His origial doseage was 5mg twice a day once at 4PM and again at 7PM however last year I spoke with our family DR and informed him that it seemed as though at times it made it to where he could not go to sleep he would lay there in bed and stare at the ceiling or mess around for 3-4 hours after going to bed so we decided to cut out the 7PM dosage. However, he still has this problemm at times. I have also noticed that there are times that this medicine seems to help and then other times he still bounces off the wall so I have had mixed feelings about it. I am thinking it is time to re-evaluate him and maybe try something differant.

4$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/9/2010 3:45:40 PM$Reviewer: John, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$2$"My Presciption 40mgs/day (I only take 20-30 though)

After taking this medication for a month now, it has been very good for me so far. The first week being on this med I was skeptical, and it didn't seem to be working very well, but I decided to go a couple more weeks, to see what happens. 

It seems like once I got to my 3rd week the Ritalin started working better, I know people say it is a stimulant, so it should work immediantley, but I think people don't understand that although it works the first time it may not work right till your body gets used to it. 


Here are my pros and cons of it so far:

Pros: 
-Better Focus, yeah I still get distracted from time to time, but It's WAY easier to focus and concentrate.
-My Vision looks sharper, almost like how a T.V. is when you turn up the contrast. 
-Better a video games... Hey I'm a college student this stuff is important too lol.
-Slightly more sociable, a little less shy
-I feel more like a ""Normal"" person

Cons: 
-Slightly increased heart rate 72bpm to 80-90bpm
-I get irrated easier
-Occasional mild depression when it is wearing off
-Desire to take more, it's scary (I DO NOT do this though)
-Decreased Appetite



If you're on this med, don't be too quick to judge, give it a month and see if it starts working better."
5$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$3/8/2010 5:23:03 PM$Reviewer: sinkingintograce, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$4$I've been taking it for a month, and the first week it was amazing.  I could concentrate on everything, and my mood was even better.  Now though, only a month later I can't even tell when I don't take it other than when I don't I feel more moody, less happy.  Not helping the ADD anymore, and my mood wasn't this bad before.  I feel like my mood depends on this drug and I don't like that.

I HATE IT. The name brand Ritlin works Very Well. and so does the NAME BRAND adderall. But my insurance keeps REFUSING to ok the name brand. they say I have to try some of the others and it just IS NOT RIGHT !!! 
8$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$9/6/2009 9:10:20 AM$Reviewer: anatomyhardcore, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$just started the medication yesterday, i noticed not long after that i focus on one thing at a time instead of my mind constantly running 90 miles an hour over everything you can imagine, i was actually able to focus on what my child was doing instead of day dreaming away. cant wait to go back to school on tuesday to see just how much this medication will help me. so far no side effects, but some weight loss might be a welcomed side effect for me :)

11$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/26/2008 2:34:30 AM$Reviewer: 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $1$1$1$Seems to get better reviews for older patients, I don't think it works for children very well at all. My stepson has been on this medication for a little over two years and the side effects just keep getting worse. He seems to go a little further into his own world every day.

I have been on many many anti-depressants. The medication that helped me the most was Methylin Oral. I was passed on to many Doctors way too often and began to feel like a guini pig so I stopped  believing in mental health drugs all together. 
Thank you so much for listening, I would like to hear from someone who believes in me.
Sincerely,
Nancy Rainford"

He also experienced a nose bleed but not sure if the medication was the cause of this even though side affect suggest some bleeding. Abilify is a great alternative and Risperdel.

I put ice cream in the cupboard and couldnt remember if I had washed my hair already or not while in the shower.  Since begining the medication, I have been able to focus and remember what I had and hadnt done yet.  Its not a full proof medication, the ""to-do"" lists are still a required aid. "
