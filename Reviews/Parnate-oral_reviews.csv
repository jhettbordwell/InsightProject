0$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$4/28/2019 5:26:38 PM$Reviewer: WAS, 65-74 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"As with so many other reviewers, I tried multiple meds of multiple types, singly and in combination, to treat 50  years of depression. Some were effective for awhile and then lost their effectiveness. Some were ineffective from the beginning. I also had two ECT series (12 treatments in each series) with Ketamine as the anesthetic. Almost seven years ago my psychiatrist suggested Parnate. At that point I would have agreed to rat poison if she told me it might work. We did a standard slow increase in dosage. The primary side effects were insomnia and a sudden complete loss of energy in the late afternoon. I began to feel positive effect at 50 mg. 60 mg was better, but with only partial recovery. After searching the Internet I came up with a few old articles about mega-dosing Parnate. My psychiatrist agreed to increase the dose if I would take my blood pressure two hours after every dose. I'm now on 120 mg. Most of the time I feel quite good. I no longer have the ""freight train smacked me"" feeling in the afternoon. I continue to have insomnia and have learned to live with it. I'm very careful about the food I eat, especially when we eat out, and about over the counter meds. I've have never had a food reaction. Parnate helped me get back to a life worth living."
1$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/2/2016 3:20:48 PM$Reviewer: Rejuvinated1155, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Parnate has worked 10x better than any other anti-depressant I've ever taken (and I've tried loads of them).  Diet is easy if you have the latest guidelines.  I see a couple reviewers here have had the 1-2 hour high BP episodes, but these are pretty easy to avoid.  If you get one, a benzodiazepine med will reverse it.  Like I said though, just a couple dietary things to look out for - I have never had any problems, just overall blood pressure decrease (my BP was high anyway) and almost complete disappearance of my horrible depression and anxiety.  I have my life back now.
2$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/12/2016 6:23:41 AM$Reviewer: ssrissuck, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've dealt with major depressive disorder for 22 years and have always had to be on several anti-depressants at one time. They only lessened my symptoms in the best of cases, but did nothing most of the time. I've been on every antidepressant in addition to things like risperdal as an adjunct. I was on 450mg welbutrin, 60mg remeron and 120mg cymbalta concurrently with no effect when I decided to take the maoi plunge. That was 18 months ago. It's truly amazing to feel normal. I'd forgotten what that felt like. I have my life back.

I do have to say the first couple of months were the most brutal med adjustment I've ever been through. I think most people would have given in and quit. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat and generally felt like I was going out of my mind. Glad I stuck it out. After the first few months I've had no side effects besides a little afternoon fatigue.

I've had no trouble with diet and slowly tested items to see what I could get away with. Now I eat pretty much what I want with the exception of ""real"" cheese (no problem with bland supermarket colbys, mild cheddars, jack etc.) I've never had a hypertensive reaction."
3$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/13/2015 3:16:21 PM$Reviewer: kevin M, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken parnate for 25 years.  It saved my life and is the only medication (I tried many) that has worked for me.  I have had insomnia since I started with it in 1990.  This has been ameliorated, but not resolved, by addition of ambien, neurontin and trazedone.  I take a very high dose of parnate (170 mg/day-110 mg in the morning, 60 mg seven hours later).  In 2001, I went off parnate to try to find a safer medication and became very ill.  Although going back on parnate did not work at first, the addition of zyprexa to the parnate miraculously brought me immediately out of profound depression.  I have had two hypertensive crises.  I am very careful about diet and rarely eat out.  I am not clear what caused my crises, but both occurred after eating at restaurants.  I have to be careful about stress, exposure to too much sun or to high heat (e.g., saunas) and physical exertion, as these can cause dangerous side effects.  With it all, I can be nothing but thankful for this life-saving drug.

Within a week it was like someone had flipped a switch and I could actually smile and mean it.  I had four suicide attempts and was continually cutting. I have not had that feeling since going on the Parnate and am extremely happy.  I will say the diet restrictions are a challenge until you get used to them but definitely worth it.
5$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$10/6/2015 4:49:09 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$3$"After I have tried many other antidepressants that did not help, my doc gave me this. 
First my condition got better and I thought ""Yeah, finally I found something that helps me"", but after a few months my mood began to drop again. I still felt better than before, but far away from good. So I took a higher dose and I felt better again, but with the side effect that my blood pressure was too low. So I changed back to the lower dose. 

I don't get a high blood pressure when eating high thyramine food, so I eat what I want."
6$Condition: Other$8/13/2015 5:02:03 PM$Reviewer: suprherogrl02 , 25-34 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$After 11 years and countless doctors my current psychiatrist FINALLY put me on an MAOI. I had tried every SSRI, SSNI, and anti-psychotic medication out there. At first she put me on Nardil which I was allergic to (bad hives everywhere) then we tried the Emsam patch which didn't work at all and honestly who wants to have to wear a patch all the time. About 3 months ago we hit the nail on the head with Parnate (only 40mg in the morning). LIFE SAVER!!! I am a completely different person: positive attitude, lost 25 lbs. in 3 months, can do everything on my own now instead of constantly relying on my parents for help. Yes, some of the side effects, drug interactions, food/drink interactions suck but it is absolutely worth it. I will admit that it took about 6 weeks to really kick in and I have pretty bad insomnia but I'm managing. Oh, by the way, I have Bipolar I Disorder. I feel slightly manic because I cannot take anything for that (all meds give me bad akathesia) but I use my energy for good now :-) not doing any destructive to myself or others. I highly recommend this medication if you've tried everything else with no success like I had!
7$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$4/14/2015 9:26:07 AM$Reviewer: patient1, 35-44 Male  (Patient) $3$3$3$Hi.  I have been on Parnate for two weeks at 30mg.  I have certainly seen an uptick in my mood and ability to get out of bed.  Side effects so far are insomnia (waking often throughout the night), afternoon fatigue that can hit you like a truck.  I am now beginning to see some of the beneficial effects start to wane and was curious to hear how others have done two weeks into therapy.  What dose did you find to be the right amount and when did you need to titrate higher?  Were the effects much more enhanced at a higher dose.  I'm just confused on how to proceed at this point and you comments would be very much aooreciated.

Had intense daytime sleepiness when first started which lasted about 2 wks. And every time I went up in doseage, same thing. After 2 wks daytime sleepiness abated. Also had at first low blood pressure. That has normalized after the first 2 months 
My depression started to lift about week 2 or 3.
And I feel like I got my normal interest and
good mood back.  My anxiety got much better.
Down side for me has been ongoing insomnia.
I have to take sleeping med to help me stay on
a normal up in the day schedule. I have a sex
drive again that I haven't had for years.
If it weren't for the insomnia this would be the
perfect antidepressant.  I have backed off on
dose to see if insomnia improved, which it has 
not, but I am afraid to stop this med because it
has given me my life back. Wish more psychiatrists weren't so reluctant to prescribe
this med. I've been on SSRIs and tricyclics and
had given up on ever feeling better until I 
took this med.  (Give it 2 or 3 wks to feel any
improvement and then another 2 months or so before I really felt much better"
9$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$8/18/2014 5:03:00 AM$Reviewer: maggiemae, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$4$I've taken Parnate for over 25 years after trying many other antidepressants.  No negative side effects.  Other than the food and drug restrictions this drug has been perfect for me. Never tried the newer drugs for depression because of the length of time it would take to get off the Parnate and try others.  The worst thing about taking Parnate is the cost.  If you have no insurance it is VERY expensive.   As a long time patient I'd recommend other newer drugs before this one as the drug and diet restrictions are to be taken very seriously and will greatly affect your life.  But Parnate still has been a God-send for me. Also, to my fellow sufferers of depression, please see a psychiatrist for medical advice if at all possible.  General Practitioners are not qualified to treat your cancer or other serious disease, so don't let them treat your serious depression, also a real disease.

I read that one of the common side effects of Parnate is weight gain. It's a shame, because it works so well on my depression. But I will not prop up my mental health at the expense of my physical health. I only hope I can get this through my doctor's head, who is of the school ""if it works, don't mess with it."""

I tried literally every other antidepressant and it took a long time before I found parnate and got my life back. I no longer am depressed and don't really have any bad days anymore. I don't have any problems with food and can eat anything I want. I have been on this medication for about 5 years and I take a very high dose of 80mg's a day. I would strongly recommend looking into Parnate if you suffer from depression and nothing else has worked. The only side effect is increased thirst so I drink a lot of water.

14$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/4/2013 4:09:52 PM$Reviewer: [email protected], 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$1$"I started Parnate in 1990.  I had been deeply depressed (with almost constant suicidal thoughts) for three years, and I had tried various other medications already.  I was hopeless. Parnate was my last chance.  It saved my life.  
However, I have acute, totally disabling insomnia since I began taking Parnate. Because Parnate also conflicts with general anesthesia, in 2001, my doctor and I tried to find a ""safer"" alternative.  When I tapered off Parnate, as necessary to try the new medication,  I returned to a deeply depressed state. This time, however, when the Parnate was restored after a failed trial on the other medication, my depression did not budge.  We even tried a megadose level.  This also failed.  And since Parnate was the only medication that had ever worked for me, I believed that my life was truly over.  However, a last chance long shot involving the combination of the megadose of Parnate with Zyprexa (an atypical antipsychotic) brought another miracle.  The black sky parted to sunshine almost immediately.  I would continue to live!  
Since starting Zyprexa, I have gained 135 pounds.  But I accept this, my insomnia (I now take 170 mg/day of Parnate) and other lesser ""side effects,"" being grateful that I have another day to live.    "

After trying many different medications plus 4 weeks of shock therapy, my doctor tried me on Parnate.  That was 25 years ago and Parnate still works well for me.  Since the 80's many new drugs have been developed for depression, but I've remained on Parnate.  I've managed well with the diet and drug restrictions.  Only problem is the cost.  If you don't have health insurance this drug is outrageously priced.  Ordering from Canada is much cheaper; check websites.  Also, I didn't eat mozzarella cheese or hotdogs for at least 15 years....these things are not harmful and I can eat them anytime I want...and I take from 8-12 pills a day.  Check with your doctor.

Parnate was administered s mono-therpy and was titrated to 60 mg daily in three divided dose. Although compliant with the MAOi restricted diet, spontanous and transient episodes of hypertension presented within about an hour of drug administration and patient would return to normotensive within two to three hours. Although none of the spontaneous episdoes fit the criteria for it havig been classificed as a hypertensive crisis, the patient nevertheless experienced uncomfortable somatic symptoms such as sweating, feeling fluah, heart palpations, nausea, nervousness, and anxiety. Although these symptoms were disturbing, there did not seem to be any long-term consequences in these limited episodes.

Finally, in 1980, with immense fear I swallowed one tab of Nardil (Phenelzine Sulfate), waited for all hell to break loose, it didn't and very subtly I lost my chronic anxiety and, once I was up to 6 15 mg. tabs I was experiencing no anxiety or ""panic"" at all. Apart from the food/OTC med. restrictions I detested the weight gain and had *heard* that Parnate (Tranylcypromine Sulfate) had much less of a weight-gaining affect. Despite my PDoc's reluctance to ""temporarily destabilize you"" I argued him into switching me to Parnate. It was no smooth transition and he was very conservative about changing meds so I began the Parnate a week before he advised because I was really on the skids with a major depressive episode. Luckily, Parnate has a fast onset of action (unfortunately for some there's a 24 to 48 hour rise in anxiety, sometimes requiring a brief co-administration of a benzodiazepine) and I was back to where I was on the Nardil. It is a high dose I take -- 7 10 mg. tabs daily -- but all such drugs have to be ""fine-tuned"" to the individual so that it's neither too much nor too little because it does vary, sometimes widely, and it's sad to see a PDoc prescribe by a generality when even an added tablet split in half can mean the difference between efficacy and inefficacy.
Not incidentally, my hoped-for weight loss was only 5 lbs, far from what I'd wished for -- unlike that of a woman I'd met who'd lost over 50 lbs making the same MAOI switchover(My guess is that she was somehow atypical). But at least I can live in my own body."
22$Condition: Depression$3/16/2012 10:24:49 AM$Reviewer: westiemom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$3$I have taken Parnate for 27 years. I went off it 20 years ago because I had a severe hypertensive crisis that nearly killed me. I tried 15 other medications but nothing worked for more than a few months to relieve my symptoms of chronic depression. I have had 3 interactions with food all from eating in restaurants. The latest was this week. I ordered a ham & onion omelette with toast. I assumed it was a safe choice but they must have had parmesan cheese or something on the same chopping block as the onion because I've never had problems with ham. I can eat cream cheese or non-aged cheddar cheese but that's it. the symptoms started right after eating. I was sweating and my vision started ti blur. I had to get outside for air. My neck started throbbing & I had to pull my car over. The back of my head was throbbing & I had to cover my eyes from the light. My friend called her husband but by the time he got there I was screaming in agony (we should have called an ambulance). I lost the feeling in my hands & feet & by the time I got to the ER I felt like the back of my head had been shot off. They didn't do anything except monitor my blood pressure which was very high. I guess there wasn't too much tyramine in the meal because my b.p. started to fall after a couple of hours. They gave me a sedative & sent me home. Two days later I've still got a massive headache & am nauseous. I know it's scary but I rarely eat i restaurants and the potentially fatal reaction is not enough to not use Parnate. Without it I lie in bed & cannot work or even look after myself. i guess it will be a while before I eat in a restaurant again.

At the time of major depressive episodes psychiatrists and doctors prescribed Trycyclic and, later SSRI antidepressants with little success. It was only in my mid thirties that Parnate was prescribed as an alternative to ECT while I was being treated in hospital for major depressive disorder. Apart from a headache that lasted for about 6 hours together with a slight rise in blood pressure on the first day [I was being monitored in case of hypertensive crisis] I had no ill effects. Day two the headaches had gone and day four I felt elated, a little hyper. Not an unpleasant feeling after years of depression and fatig. By day five all my depressive symptoms had gone and from staying in bed all day I became able to travel from the south coast to London feeling excited to be back on old home ground. Parnate really pulled me out of despair. 

I have not been affected by the dietary restrictions which do not affect all people but are listed for safety's sake to cover every eventuality. Over a period of twenty years I have found that I can eat more or less normally or that I naturally don't eat certain foodstuffs nor drink alcohol.

After a period of remission I ceased Parnate for about three years but then suffered a massive depressive collapse. My GP, new to my case as I had moved would not prescribe Parnate as he 'had never prescribed it before and was afraid of prescribing a drug 'I have no experience with'. SSRIs made me paranoid and suicidal. I complained to my PCT stating that my notes showed I had safely taken the drug before and that my GP was causing suffering withholding it. He then had a partner in the practice prescribe it and I was soon recovered but I had experienced the prejudice against this 'old' drug. Apart from some short term memory loss [which may be due to benzodiazepines] I have had only had good effects from Parnate."
37$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/16/2010 4:21:18 PM$Reviewer: missbike, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"  There is a ridiculous amount of untrue information propagated about this drug: even on WebMD there is old disproven speculation published. Parnate, and its cousin Nardil are the only drugs that will bring about true remission from intractable depression. The voodoo diet mythe have been scientificly researched in the last fiftenn years and found to mostly be single incident reports of dubious origin. The MAOI Diet is very simple now; I've taken these drugs for years and eat all the chocolate and caffeine I want. Very stinky aged cheeses are still off bounds along with certain types of beer and one or two other things but I'll give up blue cheese to be well any time!
  These drugs are absolute miracles to us who need them; Parnate is the superior in that Nardil turns every thing you eat into sugar in the liver's metabolic pathways- weight gain-a-rama! Nardil is also a soft edged rosy ride that's easier to take coming out of the Black Pit so it's tossed about with out much thought. But morbid obesity is a worse effect than giving up blue cheese...

  Parnate is the real wonder drug! US doctors are drilled in the 1960's nonsense about it but I've been off and on it for years- doctors will force me off it, ruined my newly built career in the process. But get the new information and it's not the evil drug you hear about.

  Starting it is rough; it rewires your brain to a healthier matrix in eight weeks, during which you will not want caffeine and it can be tough. Well, or close to well is a strange place after years of illness! I use 60 mg of nortriptyline with it to soften sharp edged reality. A brain illness needs some coddling still. But this drug has me living my life instead of warehoused on inappropriate anti psychotics. It also vamoosed my social phobia/ agoraphobia issues and I've ditched the weight from Bad Drugs that didn't work but warp ones metabolism.

  I highly recommend this drug. I'm actually happy, like other people are!"

I'm on 40mg. a day, I take it all in the A.M. and I do have to have Parnate as the generic did not work for me.
Also, I eat almost anything I want and have never had a problem.  I read that the food restrictions have been relaxed a it. I even drink pasteurized beer once in a while. My PSY. Doc. said that was the only kind I could drink, no Micro-Brewery beer. Now I'm not recommending other people should do this, I just know what goes on within my own body.

There are no recent studies because it does not worth it. it just like very dirty drug that might work by randomly activating different areas in the brain. I would give it 0 out of 10 in general. the newer agents in my experience are at least has some evidence. I understand some one may scarify his life style and food for some help but this is not the case with this drug, you have to scarify both. it was a big lie I wish I have not wasted my time on it. please note that the onset of action is very slow usually >3-5 weeks.

I had to beg a psychiatrist to try and MAOI because the tricyclics and other things were miserable partial solutions at best. Nardil was very good and my opportunity to experience life virtually symptom from much of the time. The formulation was changed and it no longer worked. I changed to Parnate. I loved Parnate -- total relief, but it took 120mg/day to kick in. Got a zippy little euphoric boost for about 2 hours after each dose and the darned stuff seemed to make me smarter over over the - no kidding.I'm I scientist and for some reason chronic use of this stuff seems to be enhancing my recall and work quality. Love it and take with 1200 mg Li as a stabilizer. Seems to compliment. Keep trying with and without. Works better with. Virtually symptom free. Hypertensive sensitive real bummer with high dose Parnate. I have electric PB cuff in Manbag, one on sailing yacht, 2 at home, 1 in car, all with Nifedipine in kid. One MUST be ready at all times 7x24. If on high dose Parnate, sometime one eats at restaurant and just BANG, not aware what went into the fish pie. But I can detect start of reaction long before any serious increase and get first. So even out far offshore sailing, or anywhere, I can manage it, but it take some extra care. For total symptom free life where you can't even remember what symptoms are like, it is a small price to pay. Based on more reasons than I have time to write about, I'm guessing most people who fail response simply take to little. On standard doses, Parnate does NOTHING for me. Once I got over about 110mg/day, some sun came came in, and then another 120mg and light came shining down. Then I gained some weight and found I needed up and restored it. It was very body weight sensitive, so it needs to be adjusted to a mg/kg ratio. This should not be a surprise to anyone with a technical background.

It has helped me immensely.  For me, it is an ""end of the road""

It is the only one that has worked.  A major side effect that I have recently learned of is my inability to take general anesthesia.  This has created a major problem for me, but I will not give up the drug.  The food restrictions cause you to look at the right foods more creatively and good weight loss will occur.

My Psychiatrist tried 12 other antidepressants which, not only did not help
the side effects were traumatic! Parnate worked for me within days. I have been taking Parnate {10 milligrams 2 daily) I am 69yrs old & have been taking this drug for app. 17yrs. My Bi-polar symptoms started when I was having menopause symptoms. The few time that I discontinued Parnate, I would have extreme highs & lows for months at a time!Parnate is a challenge to take because it has major food problems. There are many foods that restrictions; some include certain meats, all cheese products,some fruits & vegies (ones which contain tourmaline. I am a vegetarian, which does help. However favorite foods like cheese,avocados,anything pickled, very limited amounts of caffeine products. cheese is hard to not eat! love pizza,cheese sandwiches,eating out is complicated. Most salads include cheese &/or cheese dressings, yogurt can be touchy
as is dark green vegies. Eating any of these can cause a stroke or death. You have to be VERY CAREFUL! you CAN'T CHEAT! A food or medication that does not interact totally shuts your body down(at least mine) I feel completely disorientate & just have to take a sleeping pill & hope that I'm not having a stroke! Now I am very, very careful. Even Doctors prescribe meds for some other problem, sometimes even after I remind them. Luckily most pharmacy's will catch it. I would not recommend this, unless you have tried at 6-8 other medications.You will probably have to make dosage adjustments, & severe health or personal problems can make it ineffective!"

The SSRI's were not very effective - lots of side effects that made life unenjoyable- though I know they are very effective for others. This turned out to be a ""miracle"" drug. I took it at the height of one of my depressions and one or two days later felt significantly better. At small dosages I did not feel any side effects. At my current large dosage (60 mg)I've felt several. I have insomnia and (perhaps) have bouts of high blood pressure when drinking lots of coffee - I can't tell. Eating foods that aren't fresh causes high blood pressure and a throbbing headache.  I can't tell how frequently the high blood pressure occurs on a general basis. I also don't know if my memory problems are due to it or benzodiazipines that I recently quit after long-term use- I strongly suspect the latter.  I obviously suggest staying at a small dose.  "
