0$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/2/2019 1:19:58 PM$Reviewer: Anxious driver , 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$2$Iâ??ve been on only 25 mg for a few weeks and have read so many scary horrible reviews about the side effects Iâ??m afraid to go up to 50 mg. Iâ??ve watched every lamictal you tube video review, and read every article online I can find, and continue to worry this drug was prescribed to me incorrectly by a psychiatrist who saw me for the first time for literally only 5 minutes. I donâ??t even know if he thinks Iâ??m bipolar. I told him how I felt, he wrote me a script for this, and I was out the door. I went home to research the drug, and panicked more by the side effects I read. He told me there were no side effects with lamictal! What a lie. He said itâ??s the gentlest of all of these types of drugs. I know I have GAD anxiety 
1$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/8/2019 3:37:20 PM$Reviewer: Elle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have bipolar II disorder. I stopped medication for about 3 years because I felt myself stabilizing. I never had any major episodes, but I tend to be more hypomanic than depressed. I decided to start taking medication again because although I could function, it was a daily struggle to manage my moods.
More mature and in tune to my mental health, I communicated my needs and concerns to my new psychiatrists. Like I said, Im more manic, so in the past when doctors prescribed me an anti-depressant, it would make me even more anxious and irritable. I also did not want a medication that caused weight gain because I have had an eating disorder in the past and didnt want weight gain to trigger that.
My doctor recommended lamictal (only). He gave me the ""rash"" warning and told me I may not feel better for a few weeks while he slowly increases my dosage...
I am completely astounded! I have only been taking lamictal for a few days, so Im not sure why he says it takes weeks. I have not even taken it for 2 weeks and I have so much energy and motivation. I have cleaned my apt (long overdue), got school supplies early, usual stressors at work dont phase me! 
It is not a medication that makes you feel super joyful or too dim. I feel like it just lifts the bipolar cloud from your life. I just feel like I can fully function! Everybody is different, but if your mental situation is similar to mine, definately give lamictal a try!

FYI...I dont remember ever reviewing a medication. Hope this helps someone! God bless you."

3$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/28/2019 1:59:02 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been on so many medications for my depression over the last 14 years, it was so bad that I was almost disabled and I am only 34 years old, a wife, mother of two, full time nurse. I had given up on finding medication to help me and was looking into ect therapy. My nurse practitioner recommended lamictal, I was so skeptical but agreed to try it. After a couple of weeks paired with my other medications I could see a difference in my mood and energy levels. I had feelings of happiness and before it was only flat affect or sadness. I was very resistant to touch prior to the lamictal, with the addition of the medication, my touch aversion went almost completely away. Dont get me wrong, I take several other psyc medications, but the addition of lamictal was a big game changer for me. 
4$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/26/2018 12:14:19 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$2$1$I was on lamictal for Bipolar Depression II. It helped significantly with my mood swings and anger/mania and I actually loved the effect it had for helping with stabilizing me in general. The side effects unfortunately were too difficult for me to deal with. I gained 30 pounds in three weeks, from the medication as I was retaining too much water and sort of swelled up. It also didn't really help my anxiety and caused panic attacks when I was feeling more depressed than normal. 
5$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/11/2018 1:43:41 PM$Reviewer: leslie, 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$I found the side affects too difficult to handle. the weakness, dizziness, and overall feeling of being sick were not worth it. I am currently going off this medication.

7$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/12/2018 11:12:32 PM$Reviewer: Cmg88, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been taking this drug for 18years.   It really helps my mood and anxiety.  I can’t say enough great things about it!  Be careful of the manufacturer though, because generics vary 20% from brand.  I prefer Teva Lamotrigine above all others and Cipla is the very worst.
8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/30/2017 6:58:40 PM$Reviewer: DianaB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$100% would recommend for bipolar disorder.  I haven't had an episode or any kind of emotional outbursts (besides family deaths) since taking it.  I didn't get any side effects (although I was paranoid about the deadly rash I could get when I first started taking it).  
9$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/22/2017 12:46:54 PM$Reviewer: Wookie, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$Lamictal has done wonders for my bipolar type 2. Symptoms have decreased dramatically. I have noticed however that I get a funny taste in my mouth on a regular basis (every 2-3 weeks for about a week at a time) and I have muscle tightness in neck and shoulder. Other than that, it is helpful for me .
10$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/25/2017 6:38:51 PM$Reviewer: LostAlice, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$It has substantially helped me with my Bipolar type 2 . I am able to function and although I'm not out there running around full of joy and happiness. I am able to lead a life and not sit in bed moping all day. It helps level out my emotions as well which range from completely depressed to just uncomfortable and unhappy to normal with little onslaughts of sadness here and there. I wouldn't be able to have a life without it so it's definitely worth trying .

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder 24 years ago.I have been on every medication there is in that time, nothing worked for very long. I started taking lamictal almost 3 years ago and it has been working wonderfully for me. I have been able to maintain stability and balance for the first time in my life.
13$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/27/2017 3:23:43 AM$Reviewer: TristanCarman, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$4$I have taken it for 8 years with the exception of when I was pregnant. Other than suppressing my appetite and causing my sodium and blood sugar levels to drop drastically low it has been a miracle. Make sure if you have low blood sugar issues you speak with a nutritionist on the best plan of action to meet your dietary needs. 
14$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/3/2017 10:38:24 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication changed my life for the better. It helped me so much! Thank you to the people who developed it.

Even things I like to do before no longer interests me. I don't feel so down anymore, already long time, but it's really not nice to feel lazy, fatigued and all I like to do is just to sit and do nothing... And I have neck pain and arm pain, not sure if it's from the Lamictal

I was hospitalized at 117. Be careful on this drug. It has been a miracle drug for 8 years for my bipolar. I lowered dose from 200 mg to 100 mg and my sodium in 1 weeks time is back up to only 2 points below so I doubt I'll have to come all the way off of it. It's been a miracle and I love it. Just beware and have your sodium checked. Low sodium is serious!!!!

I take this with Abilify (10 mg) and it has truly changed my life. I haven't had a full-blown manic episode, and as long as I've taken the medication, I've never had a major depressive episode either. I'm now at 300mg and it's a life-saver. Literally.
22$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/3/2016 1:43:26 PM$Reviewer: lili belle, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$My psych and neuro docs missed all of the side effects I was having from Lamictal for over a year.  My pharmacist recognized them in 3 sec. when she looked at my med list. The drug turned my brain to Jello. I will list them in no particular order.  Getting lost for <30 miles while going to dr. Going to church on Tues. at midnight, falls with fractures, needing a cane then a walker, double vision, blurred vision, (of course no driving),slurred and very slow speech, limited vocabulary and problems with word finding, confusing, memory loss,severe tremors--total body, 5-7 day a week home care and physical therapy because I could not maintain my personal care.  My life consisted of eat, sleep(most of the time, pee and go to the dr.  This past year was complete hell.  Both drs. told me I was just anxious and this symptoms were part of my mental disorder.  I weaned myself off and the switch flipped after 3 days and improved by ? in 7 days. Stevens-Johnson isn't the only problem that drs. need to watch for (look beyond the black box warnings!), Patients need to listen to what your body and R.Ph tells you.  Both drs. dropped their jaw when I skipped into their offices.
23$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/18/2015 10:13:31 AM$Reviewer: Enid Fire, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$5$Overall mood has been better after one week of the 25mg pills one more week at this dose, then I am supposed to increase to 50mg. I have not been sleepy or groggy as many of the anti-depressants made me. I also do not feel any changes in appetite like the anti-depressants seemed to make me eat more. I sleep well and have not had dreams that were anymore weird than usual, as some people have stated they had weird dreams on lamictal. I have had a hard time getting up early, I was getting up at 4:30 a.m. but struggle to get out of bed for work because I am resting so well- this could be a good or bad thing, less anxiety but late to work. I do not have racing thoughts and even manage to smile and laugh during the day which is rare for me. In addition, I am getting things done without all of the worry and anxiety. So far so good Lamictal. I will post another update when I increase to 50 mg on 12/29/2015
24$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/15/2015 4:44:49 PM$Reviewer: Steph, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$3$I use it alongside Seroquel and they have been the only reason I am in a good place. I would be nothing without these drugs. The only thing I don't like is that if you don't take it for 3 days you have to wean back onto it because of its half life. Everything else is fabulous!
25$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/15/2015 4:12:07 PM$Reviewer: Enid Fire, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I started Lamictal today to treat bipolar phase one. I took the 25mg pill at 1:30 p.m. and by the time I got back to work from lunch at 2:00 I was focused and  energized. Lets see how my eating goes, most of the medications I have tried in the past seem to induce my habit of binge eating, maybe this will be different. Will post update in a few days.

No adverse effects on sexual desire, in fact a dose right before sexual activity increases the intensity of orgasm!!! No other psych drug does this. Plus, it doesn't make you become a whale with weight gain. As long as you monitor for lethal rash side effect... Most definitely Gods Gift to us bipolars out there.

It totally changed my life. I don't have the feeling of impending doom and the constant panic attacks are gone. The extreme mania never occurs. I haven't experienced any side effects. I've been on 500mg for going on 5 years. I do think I may need to increase the dose doe the first time in years. I'm beginning to experience a slight lack of wanting to engage in anything again. Not motivated to do the things I need to do. Even calling the doctor to make the appointment seems like a major undertaking  Procrastination to say the least. But that's only been recently.

When I was first diagnosed, I was prescribed lithium and sinequin.  I was a zombie so I took myself off them after a few months.  I've been on just about every antipsychotic drug on the market throughout the years. For the past few years I been prescribed 20 mg of citalopram in am and 20 mg of mirtzapine.  Last year, after a depressive episode, my psychiatrist introduced the lamotrigine to my regimen.  I was prescribed 100 mg am and 100 mg pm.  It changed my life.  I haven't felt this clear, focused and level in almost 40 years.  My relationships with my friends and family have been at an all time high.  I have now been decreased to 50 mg in am and 50 mg in pm. and I still feel good.  Still having minor bouts of depression and mania but I am more aware of them and they are less frequent and severe.  I would strongly recommend trying this medication.

Been in this at various doses for over 2 years.  With my other meds, it has worked better than anything I've ever taken, for my major depression, bipolar.  About a year ago i complained to my Dr. About the very uncomfortable feeling in my legs, that happened often, and I couldnt do anything to stop the episodes.  Caused me to pace, couldn't sit still it lie down. It was fidgety leg syndrome, (sounds minor, but it's not when its not ESP when it is occurring frequently). She put me on cogentine for the side effects.  I don't have fidgety legs anymore.  I've had a terrible dry mouth that makes it very difficult to talk, or swallow.  My legs tighten up with my feet in a curled up position, very tightly, while lieing down.  While standing, my calves are very still tight and my big toe on my left foot stats extended upward and all other toes in a cramped position.  It is almost constant, as much as I try to relax or stretch it doesn't go away.  I've told my dr of this many times and she continues to lower my dose of Lamictal and its 'side effect cure"" cogetin.  Still there, but very much improved.  No improvement on my tightened legs, feet  and body at  I don't know what to do.  Not sure which is causing it, and since my depression has improved so much, (with the help of meds and very intense therapy).  These side effects are to difficult to ignore and to deal with. "

When I crashed afterward it was very difficult, because I had begun to hope that this was my new ""normal"".  It has not eliminated my symptoms.  However, in conjunction with other medications it has mitigated them somewhat.  I have not gone into full blown mania since I've been on it, only hypomania twice.  Nothing really seems to help with the depression.  My husband is on the same medication for seizures, and for him it has been a miracle drug."

43$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/25/2015 3:51:03 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Lamictal is great for using in conjunction with other forms of antidepressants. Some SSRIs/SNRIs give you too much energy and actually make your urges more difficult to tolerate. If you take this as a stand alone for mood disorders then you will be disappointed. It is the safest alternative to any other mood disorder drug. Sad to hear other people's issues while taking Lamictal.

I take it in the mornings with my Cymbalta 60mgs and Adderall 20mgs. Today I started 50mgs of Lamictal and I have had the weirdest changes in mood all day long until finally settling into this reeeallly drowsy state where all I want to do is lay in bed. I can't focus on anything and my afternoon dose of Adderall was pretty much wasted because I still couldn't focus due to being so tired.

I've read that most people don't REALLY start feeling less swings until 100mgs, and that the therapeutic dose is 200mgs. So I am going to stick it out and I have a psych appointment tomorrow to get his opinion. But today has been rough and I'm out of klonopin until tomorrow as well because we recently lowered that significantly. 

I'm hoping this really weird drowsy/tired/sleepy/no motivation/no energy/no emotions/blah/netflix-binge mood is not how this medicine will make me feel for very long.

I've been struggling with mood swings for a long time, but I never sought treatment. I assumed what I was going through was the normal wear and tear of life, but it wasn't. My mood swings started affecting my life, from my job, to my relationship with my new wife. I talked to my doctor about my mood swings and he recommended Lamictal. Since I started taking the medication a month ago I have literally not had a single mood swing. I feel happier than I have in years. If you want a medication that works and gives absolutely no side effects then this is the medication for you! (duh)
48$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/17/2014 10:49:26 PM$Reviewer: pennylaine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I have only been on Lamictal for 4 days now. I'm also on Cymbalta 60mgs, Xanax .5mgs at night to help my mind stop racing so I can sleep, and Adderall 20mgs 2x a day. Also prescribed Trazadone if I feel like I need it but I hate taking it. Anyway, back to Lamictal, my psych instructed me to take 25mgs 1x daily for 2 weeks. This is day 4 and it seems like it is making me more depressed and just really irritated and blah feeling especially in the late afternoon/evenings. I have been on all of these other medications in the past and never had an issue with any of them. Lamictal is the only new thing added to that cocktail. After the 2 weeks are up, I go to 50mgs a day. I just feel kinda apathetic, annoyed, and very low energy at night and I take it in the mornings with my Cymbalta and Adderall. I need to call my psych Monday to ask if I should push through these first 2 weeks or what... Anyway, that's my experience so far. Hope it changes. I used to be on Abilify for bipolar and never had any problems with it... Maybe he'll switch me back but from what I understand, that's a completely different category of drug. Any input anyone???

In December 2010 I attempted suicide and was placed in an intensive outpatient treatment program. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and Anxiety Disorder and was put on Lamictal and Xanax (.50 mg). My therapeutic level for the Lamictal was/is 150mg (200mg caused difficulties sleeping). The Lamictal helped with the depression and ""dark thoughts"". I was on the meds from December 2010 - March 2012 and got cocky and decided I was cured and didn't need the meds anymore (not realizing the truth the meds were doing what they were suppose to do).  At first I was fine but by November 2013 things began spinning out of control with my depression and hypo mania. In May 2014 I was so distraught and spiraled down again that I left work went home and cut myself 17 times. Once again I was back in intensive outpatient treatment but for longer this time. I was put back on the Lamictal the end of May 2014 and once again the ""dark thoughts"" have subsided and I am feeling stronger again (and have managed to deal with four deaths of friends the past three weeks and though my emotions were grief and pain which are expected, the out of control bleakness has not occurred). I have had to come to terms that I will always require med management for my disorder and can not go off my meds again as my ""experiment"" of being fine without them was a complete failure. I am not saying everyone will experience the same results and obviously by the mixed reviews many have not. All I know is after 36 years of medication experimentation Lamictal has proven to be the one which was by far the most effective for me!  (FYI - I experienced no side effects other than sleep difficulties at 200 mg and so it was readjusted back to 150 mg which has proven the best level for me.)"

After visits with 5 different doctors, including being sent home by an ER doctor, they finally decided her skin rash was Steven Johnsons/TENS and flew her to a burn center.  She lost over 100% of her skin, spent weeks on a ventilator, has had multiple surgeries, including skin grafting, and experiences severe and constant pain. She was young and strong and will be fortunate enough to escape this experience with only extensive scaring, dry eyes, and hypersensitivity to cold and heat.

I was taking risperdol, zoloft and Xanax, but was still very depressed. It was to the point that I had stopped eating preppy and could not take care of myself hygienically. I didn't care how I looked, if my coo these were dirty, or if I smelled. I only took a shower every 10-14 days. Basically until I couldn't stand myself any longer and got afraid of being in trouble at my part time job. I finally talked to my doctor about all of this and she put me on lamictal. After four weeks I was on 100mg per day. The difference is night and day. I eat well, take care of myself, and no longer have to worry about my cleanliness. Sometimes I still struggle with the energy to do things I need to do, but for the most part am doing very well. I am taking the lamictal in addition to all the meds listed ate the beginning, even my friend says I am more perky and have a more positive outlook on things instead of being so negative all the time.

I take it mainly for depression, but since reaching perimenopause age, I have a bit of bipolar symptoms.  It is slightly less effective for control bipolar systems such as hyper/hypomania, weight gain, and fatigue.  I do get dizzy more often, and am extremely thirsty all the time (I drink a LOT of water, but I feel like that's healthy). I also notice headaches when I don't take it for a few days. I'm on 350 mg, and it is a right dose for me.  I do also have insomnia, which is not related to the drug by perimenopause. I, however, don't get NEAR as depressed as I used to, and for that I am eternally greatful to the psychiatrist who started me on Lamictal.  I think I'll be taking this drug for a long time, as it really has made my life outlook SO much better.

I was placed on Wellbutrin first, and it improved my mood and energy level.  However, I was still irritable, explosive, quick to anger and intolerant. My doctor put me on 25 mg of Lamictal, and I felt different immediately.  I felt more centered, patient, calmer and mellow.  My employees and husband also noticed the difference in my mood. I went up to 50 mg and, eventually, to 75 mg, my current dose.  I am on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, Wellbutrin SR 100 mg and Lamictal 75 mg.  this combination has changed my life.  I think and communicate more intelligently, and I am more level-headed.  It hasn't changed my personality.  It just stabilized my mood swings.

He started on 25mg and now 75mg and will start 100mg on the 16th.  He's basically very depressed.  He was on Effexor and Seroquel (400mg XR) for some time but developed some breast tissue on the nipple area.  So he stopped Seroquel and started Lamictal as mood stabilizer. After stopping Seroquel, the breast tissues are still there.  The Psychiatrit said there is no the same side effect on boy growing breasts for Lamictal.  However, from some web sites, I saw a lot of women talking about their breasts were signigicantly enlarged for a couple of cups. I also read 2 posts saying one 13-year-old boy and a middle-aged man discribing they have gynecomastia.  Could anyone shed light on this problem?  Is there any document indicating this is a side effect?  Do you have any experience with it?  Seroquel can increase the prolactin level.  I am not sure if Lamictal has the same side effect but works in a different way (estrogen, etc.).  I did read that Effexor has the same side effect but very rare. I only hope my son's problem is not getting worse with the treatment.
Your kind help is very much appreciated."

You can start at a low dose and work your way up gradually.  Lamictal prevented me from backsliding further into my depression and brought me out of it.  I am not depressed and feeling stable for the first time in five months.  Please try this drug and I hope it works for you!

I took this for years and was greatly affected by a little-known(but stated in the literature)very bad side effect. Extreme Vitamin D deficiency, which caused profound depression, low energy and lowered immunity. As someone who struggles with depression I could see my depression was not connected to events. The literature indicates that this drug produces liver enzymes hostile to vitamin D. THAT is a problem! I had a level 5.5, should of been 36 or so. That depression-crying for no reason at work!& compromised immunity, extreme fatigue is not uncommon. Follow bipolar groups and you will find a pattern of extreme depression when patients start on it oftentimes. Alot of them complain about it. Be CAREFUL.

It started helping after a short period of time. I got up to the recommended dose (100mx 2x daily), it helped a ton, but was not quite there... I wend through a short cycle of depression, the pdoc upped my Wellbutrin, I went into mania so he lowered it back down, then I was on the low side. He upped the Lamictal to 150 mg 2x daily, and I have been great (please note, that is not a recommended dose for Lamictal used for bipolar, but is well under that which can be prescribed for seizures, he raised it after consulting with other psychiatrists in his office). It has worked well with my particular cocktail to stabilize my bipolar symptoms. -Wellbutrin XL 300 mg (in am) -Seroquel 100 mg (in pm) -Lamictal 300 mg (15 mg 2x / day)

The bad: This medication never fails to cause me severe headaches whenever I drink even a single beer or glass of wine. The headaches start shortly after drinking the beverage and typically last until the next morning. The headache pain is not lessened by taking over the counter pain relievers. Although I've never had more than 2 beers at one sitting (well, during adulthood anyway!), I do enjoy having them on occasion. I've switched to O'Doul's but I'm pretty fed up with the situation. At least I didn't get the rash!

I take 100mg twice a day, 6am & 3pm, I also take 200mg of Bupropion at 6am & 3pm. I have horrible deep depression and fears. I have Bipolar 1, so they say, but I've never been manic, I just have deep depression and deeper. I am better then I was prior to 2001. I could not move. leave the house or shower. I sleep as much as I could. I did not want to live - but I didn't harm myself. I couldn't socialize. I was petrified. Now, I work, care for the home & boys and shower often. But I stay in my small office, alone,  all the time. I do not have fun, I can't. Confusion & short term memory loss. Horrible fears and nervousness. Afraid of phone and mail. No ambition no sex. Want to get off med but it's hard, makes you sick. I'm sure Lamictal is helping I just might not be able to help. I've had many traumas, baby died, had stoke,lost best job, lost wife, kids arrest, wife narcissistic, bankrupt. One thing after another, no peace, no money now after wife left headed for homeless.

Before taking this med I was living with so much emotional agony and strife...terrible mood swings, chaotic relationships, could not hold a stable job,etc. I finally hit rock bottom and saw a psychiatrist. Was initially scared to take meds because of the scary potential side effects. But I was willing to try anything to save my life & sanity!!! Within ONLY 2 days of taking 25 mg I felt much, MUCH better. Very calm ,without the erratic mood swings. Now I am up to 50 mg daily and feel even better. My boyfriend was on the verge of breaking up with me before lamictal, he just could not handle my raging mood swings and verbal abuse. Now we are happy and finally have a loving,healthy relationship!!! THIS MEDICINE IS A GODSEND!!!! AI RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS SUFFERING IN MISERY AND WANTS TO FINALLY ACQUIRE INNER PEACE.

(Once it caused me to fall off a curb and the second time I made a fool of myself trying to walk down the concourse in a large air port.) Both times the episodes (three years apart) seemed to have to do with how little food I had eaten that morning prior to taking Lamictal. My first psychiatrist took me off the drug altogether and then put me back on it when I was experiencing deep and long depression. After the second episode of losing coordination, my new psychiatrist wrote down ""low blood sugar"" with no discussion.

I fought dx because of no manic (whoo hoo, happy) moods, then was told it was due to my anger & the depression was so deep it was very hard to come out of. I was put on Adderall with no side effects. It does get me out of bed in the am. My husband calls Lamictal the miracle drug. That's because he was on the receiving end of my anger rants & they were really bad! I was doing great with my medication for a while, but I can't afford therapy & it is a daily struggle to keep myself motivated. I do get unscheduled motivation, what I call ""A bug up my ..."" & I go until I can't, but they are far & few in between. I think I need an increase in my Lamictal.

I do, however, feel a bit 'weepy' at times, somewhat like PMS.  Not sure if that's depression or a side effect. I have noticed that my eyes are red, itchy and burning-- almost like conjunctivitis-- and I'm very dehydrated. The itchy eyes may be due to allergies (of which I have many) but it popped up as soon as  I started this medication.  I will most likely discontinue since I don't want to run the risk of messing with my vision and I am also quite concerned about 'The Rash' that appears to be not as rare as I thought. My coordination and memory is also a bit wonky and my appetite has increased.   

I gained a TREMENDOUS amount of weight (in addition to other unbearable side effects, like drooling, nervous movements, non-existent cognitive abilities) whilst on other psychotropic drugs 18 years ago, which led to my discontinuing all medications until recently after my symptoms became more troublesome.  

I am therefore quite wary of psychiatrists and psychiatric drugs."

Taking Lamictal for about 6 months. Was taking Cymbalta before that. Lamictal is the better of the two. The side effects certainly occur but I consider them annoying, nothing more. I listed them in case you may think your side effects are unusual. Side effects (for me) include: Have experienced a slight back-of-the tongue swelling. Can't climb a ladder. Very emtional eg cry at the drop of a hat. Have to sleep every few hours. Vomitting during a meal every couple of weeks or days. Extreme laziness is almost constant. Summary: Love this drug. My actions were unpredictable before taking Lamictal.

The doctors added Lamictal and Seroquel. The Seroquel was horrid! Had an unsatiable appetite and gained over 30 pounds in a short time. We discontinued the Seroquel, and now just on the Lamictal. The appetite is back to normal but still struggling to lose wieght. I feel more stable now than I have in years. I don't know if the Lamictal is an adherent to my weight loss efforts. Sometimes I get an eerie/dizzy type feeling but it passes quickly. My memory seems to have dulled somewhat and I can't always find the right word I am looking for, but other than that, I think this drugs benefits have outweighed the perceived side effects. I sleep better and can get up in the mornings now so much easier. I wish someone knew the long term effects of this drug. I hate taking meds, but I guess this one is a winner cause I don't feel like running or committing suicide any more. My family is sure happier with me.

My doctor put me on Lamictal, and it's much easier to control. They figure I have bipolar II. When I first began the medication, I would type entire wrong words. It was kind of strange, but only lasted a month. Maybe a little clutziness too. The only complaint was that it made it where I couldn't get very deep sleep. It's like the lights were on 24/7. After a year, my doctor lowered my dosage of Lamictal and put me on something to help me sleep. It's been good ever since.

This is the one that I have difficulty 'feeling', as was explained to me by my doctor before being prescribed it. However, this isn't all that bad, as I have noticed much less profound mood swings since I have taken it. 

Yes, new patients start low and work up...for me, I boosted it by about 50mg weekly until I got to 350mg, which is where I am currently at but my psychiatrist may boost it a little more. 

I am satisfied with the somewhat stealthy nature of this medication's effects, as this means that the side effects don't feel there at all. I took quite a few mood stablizers in the past and noticed unpleasant side effects; mainly related to energy and mental numbness. 

I feel like I need to be on this a little longer to really gain more wisdom about it (it's been around 5 months for me now), but so far I have had no reason to want to go off of it, and I am no stranger to mood stabilizers..."

I have regualar depression and anxiety.  A new psychiatrist put me on Lamictal. Said it work on uni-polar depression(that being me)I Icould ony get up to 75mg..100mg casued sever agitation. So I return to my original psychitrist for other reasons. ( the new psychiatrist was going to put me on ENSAM patch while taking cymbalta..= seratonin syndrone..Original psychiatrist knew about that too. ALSO she told me that taking Depakote and Lamictal = TOXIC..I am on 500mg Depakote bedtime, 125mg Depakote am. SO for now she is weaning me off the lamictal..Originall Shrink had me on ZOLOFT. It worked + .50mg Ativan..1mg Klonipin..I was fine, stable, able to handle things in calm manner, shower, drive, etc..I had not a wisper of anxiety since 2007 to March 2010. Shrink bullied me into takng Prozac..I can' take Proazac- get adverse reaction--head goes spinning out of control at 15mg. SHRINK said lower it to 10mg and BAM hit with dreadful ANXIETY. Then Zoloft gave me ANXIETY after swithced.THen another new shrink - puts me on 5-6mg Ativan/day. DX: Severe anxiety. Finally went back to origina shrink and was put on CYMBALTA..It finally greatly reduced anxiety,stil had to take about 3mg throught out day..So I have been screwed up since May 2010. Not stable at all. I REFUSED the Prozac BUT before I coud get out the most imp. info. SHRINK ambused me, Prozac,etc,etc ..I never got to tell her I took it before and I pill made my head go crazy..due to the immediate ambush. SO I have been in hell for 1year,3months. I don't trust SHRINKS anymore. I don't know what is to become of me. For those of you who have had sucess on Lamictal, I'm happy for you..Very worrid (understatement) about me. YOu don't  know what it is like to feel normal & functioal on a medication, then have your shrink bully you into med (Prozac) that has caused me to have prmanent anxiety BEAUSE shrink ambushed me before I could say: I got adverse reaction from Prozac before.

I recently began lamictal in treatment of bipolar disorder. I had been on SSRI antidepressants since around the age of 20. I thought they were working, but yet, I was still extremely depressed, anxious, and unpredictable in my behaviors. I cried all the time, became angry frequently, and felt out of control emotionally. I struggled to keep a job for longer than a year, stay in my marriage, stay focused on any one thing, or have any semblance of a balanced, healthy life. I was only ever offered SSRIs and I thought my life experience was the best it was ever going to be. I was addicted to cigarettes, alcohol, and food. 

I didn't realize how bad I actually was, until I started using the lamictal product in January of this year. Suddenly, who I was completely changed. This is my best self - the person I never imagined that I could be. 

My whole life has changed in ways I never thought possible. I don't feel so overwhelmed and tortured with guilt or depression. I am successful at work, I purchased my own home, I lost 50 lbs, and I am stable in many, many ways I never thought possible. I do attribute this to lamictal, because of the immediate and significant changes that I have experienced. The simple addition of this medication in my life has made these things possible. 

If I had known the person I could be under these conditions, things in my life would have been very different for years. I do not regret the past, as it is in the past, but I do look forward to my future so very very much more than I ever have.

I have been able to start my life over in a more productive and healthy manner. I cannot say enough about this drug - it has saved my life.

That being said, I love Lamictal.It's like a gift from God.My anger and anxiety were quelled and I felt much more confident. I'm so disappointed that I had to titrate down to 200 mg.It takes some of the edge off, but I can tell the difference.I have very few of the above-mentioned side effects, now, though.
I will be talking to my prescriber to determine if she has an idea of something I could take along with Lamictal to mimic the same effects.Maybe I'll just have to go back up to the 400 mg dose and deal with the side effects. I suppose it's a trade off, either way."

Finally, I did my own research and went and saw a mental health doctor that was able to diagnose Bi-polar disorder extremely fast.  Lamictal was the first and only drug I have ever tried for bi-polar and it makes such a difference that I was shocked.  I can't beleive how many years I went thinking my moods were normal.  No more mania where my thoughts race and no more crying either.  I noticed 12 hours or so after taking the pill it must wear off or something becaue my thoughts become fuzzy again.  I now take the pill first thing upon rising and it works fine.  No other side effects really, but if I forget to take the pill for even one day, I do feel a difference.  If you are truly bipolar then give it a shot.  My doctor informs me it's one of the best drugs for bipolar patients as it has very few side effects.  I have been on the drug for a couple years and can't beleive how much better things are.

The first month I was having daily migraines.  I stuck with it and the migraines slowly went away.  The only other side effect I have experienced is a little bit of memory loss.  It does not affect me enough to want to quit the medication.  I am taking 200 mg and it my miracle drug.  I am focused, sane and not a raging bitch anymore.  My sex drive has stabilized and now matches my husband's (instead of constantly seeking sex...I only want it two to three times a week).  It is a wonder drug for me.  I am not taking any other medications for Bipolar I Disorder.

It was prescribed to me when I became very suicidal during a low in the cycle of the bipolar. Lamictal saved my life and I would recommend it to anyone. It has kept me level for the time that I have been on it. I have had a few side effects. I am currently trying to taper off to see how I will do on a very low dose from 400mg hopefully to 150mg. I am very athletic and the med has significantly limited my stamina. Hopefully I won't relapse too badly. I will say that I owe my  life to lamictal so if you need a good med and have not tried lamictal, definitely ask your physician about it. Good luck!

I did as the doctor prescribed and I started to experience really bad side effects. First my entire inner thighs had hives and itched like crazy. However that wasn't the worst part. For a full week when I went up to 75mg, I would wake up at 5am with my back hurting and felt like I was going to have a heart attack. It got to the point that I was in so much pain that I could barely get out of bed. This wouldn't go away until 12pm when the pill wore off. At that moment, I decided to get off the meds at once.

I have decluttered my whole house effortlessly, organized things that I never seemed to be able to do.I did try I managed to get all A's in a sw master's program 20 years ago i wanted to help others and understand myself.It was exhausting. Infact everything I ever achieved was never as far as I dreamed and took a lot out of me to function.Now I hope this lasts because Everyday that goes by and i am able to keep going forward with organizing dealing with life calmly and most importantly enjoy spending time with my son.  I would be out of it and have to go to bed or so caught up in something that i was there but not really.I am able to move forward with friends, events, tasks and routines. I believe drinking smoking not get enough sleep, hormonally unbalanced (I was) stress and not having a healthy life style w food and exercise,lower the chances of having great success with any drug. after 2 months on this drug, i had a glass of wine I haven't had any alcohol in months I had a migraine body aches foggy brain.  I got over it . Some people say that coffee alcohol cashews and chocolate need to be cut out.The chocolate gets in once in a while, coffee too but i mostly drink decaf,  I am going forward and not looking back at what I created because of promises broken no shows, paranoia and just not functioning  so many dreams crushed friends lost. I value my mental functioning more than anything and love this new found freedom and ease in my ability to be in the world  I have just performed my music.  Passionate lyrics and music i have written over the years i can do it now. I hope to keep new friends and hopefully my family will gain respect and understanding when they see me functioning consistently at such a higher level.I wish all of you the same.Would like to know your stories. May I always feel this way.

I tend to find, from myself and others, that these psychological drugs just change the problem. Instead of being depressed you have headaches, blurred vision and mental confusion. Now this is not to say that the switch is bad, it's often better, but it's certainly not optimal. Once you accept this you might feel better about your situation. I have found that the headaches and lack of mental clarity are the worst for me. I'm a grad student so this is certainly not the best fit for me. But as I said earlier, it's better than being depressed and not having the desire to use my mental functions at all. I think that this drugs work best when you are under the careful watch of a doctor who really take the time to have a close relationship with you. Any kind of medication like this could be a short-term solution, a few years maybe. It's a means to an end. The end in this case is dealing with depression, mood swings and anxiety. To many doctors seem to think the medication is the end solution. I really look forward to the day I no longer have to take lamictal or any alternative. As long as you have that goal in mind, you express that clearly to your doctor and he's willing to help you reach that goal, the drug can help in the meantime. You just have to willing to accept the side effects, which as I said, while no fun in their own right, are often preferable to the alternative.

It took quite some time for me to have enough in my system but after I did, I began to fall down unexpectedly.  I was hurt twice.  I made a suicidal attempt that left terrible scars.  Finally, my thyroid enlarged to the point I looked like a man.  NONE of my doctors could say why but after a sonogram and trips to the GP,OB GYN and then ENT, I had a refill come due and reread the info.  Lo and behold my symptoms stared out at me.

I nursed on it and my son is fine (very intelligent).  I am not always happy (I am also on a low does of celexa) but I am a lot more balanced and only really offkilter before my period.  My one problem with Lamictal is that it has really messed up my memory.  I am 37 and feel like I have dementia sometimes.  It can be embarrasing when you are having a conversation with someone and you can't even recall the details of what you talked about with them about just a few days before.  But my psychiatrist says that if you get off it, the memories come back and I feel it is worth the loss of memory to feel basically normal.

I also have noticed a small rash but just saw it right before I looked it up on here and plan to call my doctor tomorrow about it. (Sadly for me, all the meds that work are ones that make me super sick. Wish it was different!) I was on lithium off and on until recently when they finally changed my meds after 8 years. I was up to 1200mgs a day of lithium and they were going to change it again and up the dosage. That's where I run into problems with my thyroid and kidneys so I opted for a new med. This one has a chance of weight loss and I'm already too heavy so I picked this one.

THE NAME BRAND, the generic is a different drug all together and dangerous.I developed depression when I was 35 due to a situation beyond my control.I was always a happy person.It got bad.After a few years,I tried antidepressants,made me angry.I went to a psychologist for talk therapy.She said that possibly I was bipolar.I was a workaholic.She recognized it as a mild manic episode,combined with the depression.She suggested I also go see a psychiatrist she knew.I went and the DR. suggested I try a new drug on the market. She was very familiar with it.She had done long studies in her internship for her Doctorate for FDA approval and it was a very promising drug for bipolar.She said she had done other studies and this drug was very successful in controlling bipolar depression.She even said it was the first drug to make such an impact on Bipolar.I was informed of the side effects, especially the rash.I researched it then went back to try it.I made an appointment in 1 month and was told to call at anytime I didn't feel quite right,any side effects,no matter how small.I was told how to slowly work up to a clinical dose 25 mg at a time, increasing weekly.I went back after 3 weeks, the terrible depression and hopelessness went away slowly IN 3 WEEKS! It brought the depression down to a manageable level,changed my life for the better.She even was surprised how fast it worked for me.I don't like meds so I slowly worked up to 175mg.My DR said a clinical dose was at least 200 and usually more. I kept that same dose for a few years until finally I increased it slowly, when I felt the depression coming on. I now take 300mg in the morning after 8years.I've had no side effects unless I forget,shakiness,it reminds me to take it. It scares me to think if I ever can't get it,I'm in trouble.I had severe reactions when I tried 3 generics,double vision,loss of ALL motor control,unable to move a muscle 7 hours 911.The generic is very dangerous.

Ive been taking lamictal for a couple years now and i love it, i feel a calm within me, even my kids have noticed a difference, i do not know where i would be today if i was not taking lamictal because my life was a rollercoaster going nowhere i kept job hopping could not stay committed in a relationship and on top of the bipolar i have adhd which i take medication for so between the two i was a very wreckless person, i tried regular depression meds but that made my moods worse so i was not sure about taking this med but i'm very grateful for it, it has kept me living a straight and narrow life im able to be and stay in a wonderful relationship. I'm over the days of not being able to stand myself when i was in my miserable angry moods. I do have alot more manic days but i like that cuz it keeps me busy and i get alot done. I have my moods and adhd under control so now i have to work on my stressing about everything all the time,but do not want to take meds for that. I recommend lamictal to anyone that can not take regular depression meds for the bipolar.

I started taking this drug about 6 weeks ago.  The Doc. started me out at 25 mg, then a week later to 50, because the drug was ineffective, she moved me up to 100 mg.  This was HORRIBLE!  I had feeling of intense anger/rage.  I was mad at my family, friends, me............the whole world.  I was really Bitchy!  I also had periods of weepiness.  I lowered my dose to 75 mg and within 72hrs I was back to my normal self.  I have had positive things happen for me.  I feel that I am more focused ie. balancing my cheekbook, on time for work, house clean and cooking more.  I have only been on the 75mg dose for a short time, I hope that I keep feeling more focused and stable, if not I will have to discontinue the drug.  I am not going to experiment with different dossages due to the severe side effects.

I didn't feel ANYTHING at all until I got up to 150mg. It was then that I started feeling the fatigue, strange muscle aches and backpain, lack of interest, lack of the ability to concentrate, strange trembles. My doctor initially suggested I take the medication in the morning because it can cause Insomnia. After two weeks on 150 mg I was instructed to go up to 200 mg. The fatigue became so severe that I would literally count down the hours and minutes until I could leave work, come home and just go to bed. I couldn't handle this so recently I decided to take it in the middle of the afternoon and it has done WONDERS for me. While I'm still getting the benefits of this medication, I don't have to deal with the fatigue or other side effects during the day. I would suggest that people try and be as patient as possible with Lamictal and attempt to find a way to take it that works for you.

Firstly because I'm a bit medication-phobic and secondly because I had a bad time with both Depakote and Gabapentin. However, I needn't have worried because Lamictal was so much easier for me to tolerate. I had no bad side effects with it at all, very slight sleepiness for the first couple of days and each time I upped the dose, but other than that nothing. Despite the annoying amount of time it takes to titrate to a helpful dose, it is definitely worth doing it sensibly to lower the chances of the dreaded rash. I started on 25mg a day and week by week increased by 25mg until I reached the 200mg a day that I take now. I have found 200 to be effective for me and am sticking with that for the time being. I know there is still further room to increase if I need it. I have only been on Lamictal since January, so 8 months now, but in that time my moods have been much more stable. I still have slight lows and slight highs but instead of my moods flying uncontrollably between -10 to +10 now it's more like -4 to +4 - I never quite seem to get any higher than slight hypomania nor any lower than slight depressions. For me this drug has helped massively.

Hard to tell as there are lots that its working and some that it is not.  I am used to all of this as I have been on meds for 20 years now.  My only problem with all of these meds is that I have gained weight and am having a hard time losing weight.  I don't really blame it on the meds though.  As long as I am feeling well emotionally I will deal with the weight.

He has been bipolar for the 33 years I have known him.  The doctor seems to think that the bipolar disorder is a bigger problem than the alzheimer's.  He is an alcoholic as well.  He has had to grown sons commit suicide.  Four other grown children , I suspect have some type of disorder as well.  Their mother is an alcoholic.  I am thankful that he and I never had children together.  He lives in an independent living facility for the past three years as my traveling job prevents me from taking care of him, he cannot be left alone.  They are having complaints about him now.  He steals small things when they take him shopping.  His comments always border on sexual and his behavior in general is very inappropriate, even in front of total strangers.  I don't know what I will do with him next.  I feel they are getting weary of him there.  I have no help financially or otherwise from his remaining 4 grown children.  He is taking Lamotrigine, Aricept and Fluoxitine for his depression.  Please, any suggestions would be appreciated.  I am at a financial loss and am having such a hard time emotionally with this as well. He is 77 years of age.

Overall, I agree with what a few others had said that at the higher dosage I feel more hostile, agitated and impatient, so I definitely recall at the lower dosages being less angry and hostile, so either I will try again at the lower dosage or I will need to come off this medication altogether cause I will not continue to itch like this all day every day.

But I would like to tell you HOW. I have been suffering with bipolar 2 for 6 years now. I literally thought I had become a crazy, worthless person. I couldn't remember conversations with co-workers and I think I was about to lose my job. My boss told me to see a psychiatrist. He is a good guy...I think that was going to be the last attempt for him to help me before firing me. I used to be a highly functioning person. I managed to graduate from college with a 3.2 GPA without going to class even 50% of the time. I loved physical activity and reading and music. 6 years ago everything changed. I was in a grad program and failed out. I was going to class and studying constantly but I was having major memory problems. Then I started having depression, then hypomanic episodes. I was just a complete mess. My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal slowly while slowly weaning me off of Lexapro. Now I am at 400mg daily and I feel wonderful. I am back to being a highly active, functioning person. I am me for the first time in 6 years. My husband is delighted--he only knew me AFTER the bipolar set in. He has loved me through all of this, but now he is just amazed at what a better person I have become. Still me, obviously, but without all of the drama. :-) Not every drug is right for everyone. Lamictal was just the one that was right for me. I am a success story. I am so happy to have my life back.

For the past  4  months,  however,  my short-term memory has significantly decreased to the point where it is negatively affecting daily functioning.

Nothing else has seemed to work as well as i have been on many meds for about 5 years.
Side effects do go way but they were not pleasant -headache,dizziness,blurred vision, but they did go way after about 3 weeks. I started on 25mgs. and now up to 200mgs. a day.  Off Paxil, Welbutrin and even an occasional Xanax.  Very pleased with Lamictal."

I was diagnosed bipolar in 1991 with possible ad/hd, which was confirmed by a long test administered by an expert in the field. From 2001 on, having lost insurance with a divorce, I was forced to seek treatment at the VA! Not good!!! Having been treated by 6 doctors there, the only were treating the depression aspect of my disorder. I was unaware of this as most of these doctors were impatient and few could speak adequate English. Finally, I was declared disabled by SS and received my Medicare card July 1 of 09. I purchased an Advantage Plan from a private health insurance company to allow me great access to health care. $ months ago, I had my first session with a highly recommended private psychiatrist. I presented my medications for review. In less than 3 minutes, he declared: ""You're not on any mood stabilizer."" Imagine my surprise and displeasure. All those years, the flip-flopping of moods, all the different combination of medications, all the family, spousal dysfunction, with divorces and separations, all the hope that the next mediation would do it and last! The new doctor prescribed this drug. Literally, within a week, and only on the trial pack, I was a new man! I hadn't felt this good in years. Everything changed. I'm also taking Cymbalta for depression but at much lower dose. Gradually, he increased my dose of Lamictal,to 200mg. And though, my current wife is living somewhere in Indiana, and there since right after her accompanying me to the new doctor, I'm naturally feeling depression as there no contact with her and I love and care for her deeply and I believe she me, I'm managing to take care of things I could not manage before. I'm opening mail, paying bills, taking showers, doing some writing, more of less living a more 'normal' life. This medication has turned my life around! I pray that these results continue. I can't praise this drug more highly. After 4-5 months, still doing fine, in spite of living alone and missing my wife. A new me!!!!"

I am on the Lamictal at 300mg as a maintenance med in-between my shock treatments.  It seems to have improved my mood balance. I have some co-morbid conditions such as ADHD, GAD, which I take other meds for.

The results are really great, used to fly off the handle at the smallest things, really moody, but not anymore. Life seems more tolerable.

After having tried other mood stabilisers (Tegretol, Epilim) antidepressants (Lexapro, Prozac and Effexor) and antipsychotics (Abilify, Seroquel and Zyprexa) I finally am starting to feel better. Before I used to stay in bed all day and took absolutely no pleasure in doing anything. But no I have got my mojo back and am starting to become more active. Still have some trouble sleeping and am taking Seroquel to help sleep and also to boost the effect of the Lamictal, it's not as good as Benzos but at least it is not addictive.  Currently taking 75mg of Lamictal and am gradually increasing to 200mg. Only side effects I have noticed are a slight unsteadiness when getting up and some insomnia. I have a soft bipolar II with only moderate hypo-manic episodes, still enough to make me do stupid stuff. Hope others find Lamictal as effective at treating bipolar depression as I have.
One more thing, does the ease of use rating seem a bit redundant, as the vast majority of medications are taken orally it is not exactly difficult to swallow a pill. Just a thought."

I've been taking it about 1-1/2 yrs and it definitely helps level my moods, it's not a cure-all I still have my ups and downs, but the swings are much less sereve and the are manageable (in fact the hypo-manic feeling I get is actually nice compared to the hyper-manic shooping sprees followed by crash and burn).
As noted this may not work for everyone, and it does take a while to start feeling the full effects, 3-6 months was my experience.
As far as side effects, I am on 300mg and I though maybe I was still a little to manic, so I was increased to 400mg and started having irratability and anger problems (which is a little known potential side affect), going back to 300mg solved that.
Just wondering though about the long term use of the product, in my experience some things would work for a while and then ""turn"" on me (Lithium for one) or stop being effective.  I'm wondering about memory issues specifically, short term, cloudy (foggy)thinking, etc."

I was diagnosed with depression and after trying several meds that caused bad side effects, Lamictal has been great. It took 6 weeks for the initial side effects such as itching, water retention, flush cheeks, etc. to go away, but after this period, the Lamictal kicked in and totally lifted the depression. at 150 mg,I am very happy with it.
I have noticed a slight rash which looks pimples when upping the dose. It goes away in a few days with Cortizon cream and Benadryl. I have also noticed that I am more hungry than before but I have not gained weight. I did lose 30 lbs I gained on Zyprexa. As far a rash goes, everyone is so stressed about the SJS rash, but not all rashes that occure are serious. It is sad that so many people see a small rash and panic, going off the med. I received a terrible rash with Lyrica and still have the scars from that. All of these meds can cause rashes. Its best to let your doctor check it out but chances are that 99% of rashes are okay and will go away."

Yes, we know it isn't ""approved"" for use in children, but he is in the care of a top notch child psychiatrist and his response to the medication has been remarkable.

A bit of history:  My son has had an ADHD dx for over a year, but clearly something else is going on, resulting in enormous rages and persistent irritability.  Also hugely swinging moods throughout the day that were unpredictable.  He was expelled from kindergarten after a particularly awful outburst at school in which he hurt another student and his teacher.  We made the excruciating decision to hospitalize him for safety reasons and try to get to the bottom of things.

After starting Lamictal, in addition to the risperdal and focalin he was already taking, his moods are smooth and emotion is appropriate to the situation.  No more rages and he's able, with help, to talk about what he feels and find solutions.  He started a new school and is doing very well socially and academically.  He's affectionate again, which is a big plus for mom and dad. :-)  Basically, now we have a 6 year old who fits in with the other 6 year olds and feels good about himself.     

NO negative side effects to this point.  Currently on 25 mg after building up slowly from 10.

We know things can get rocky again in the future, as he grows and his body chemistry changes, but for now we're VERY SATISFIED and hopeful.        "

My doc put me on this because my mom is severely bipolar, however I have symptoms of depression and OCD, so it was wrong to put me on this. Lamictal also made my OCD worse when I got up to 200mg. Be sure your doc diagnoses you correctly!

Stopped the medication immediately, but rash continued to progress.  Went to dermatologist, got a shot of prednisone to counteract the allergic reaction, but rash continues and derm. dr. said it would probably be with me for a couple of weeks.  Very uncomfortable, obviously this medicine is not for me.  Very similar to poison ivy reaction.

I started taking Cymbalta at the same time, which I think has resulted in most of the improvement, but Lamictal is definitely doing something right. I have never experienced ANY side effects from Lamictal. I take 300 mg a day; 100 mg in the morning and 200 mg at night. I have not been significantly depressed or manic since I started taking this drug, which is the longest break since my diagnosis 5 years ago. My doctor started me at 25 mg for 5 days, then 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and finally to 300 mg, with each increase 5 days apart. I think anyone who has tried a lot of medications with no success should definitely consider giving Lamictal a try.

I've been on it for 14 months and I noticed hair loss almost immediately. I can handle the hair loss to a certain extent, but I will consider other options if it gets to be too much. My short term memory is a lot worse than it was before beginning Lamictal. I've addressed the issue with my doc and she said that it is a symptom of bipolar, not a side effect of the drug. I don't agree necessarily. I've always had memory issues, but I noticed a drastic decline when I started the drug. Again, if it gets too much worse I'll consider an alternate treatment. Besides those two very frustrating side effects I've been very pleased with my moods. I take 300 mg and 300 mg Wellbutrin and the combo is working well so far. I also have ringing of the ears due to the Wellbutrin, but that's a story for another day LOL.

There's more out there and you deserve to experience life with some relief.

It took a while to find the medications that worked for me.  Don't be worried about taking more than one drug either.  I have been taking Lamictal for 3 1/2 YEARS.  I am taking 400 mg and have been for most of that time period.  I have had excellent results on this med, and have had no side effects at all, ever, nor have I had any significant weight gain.  This medicine has worked wonderful for ME.  It has stabilized my mood dramatically.  I also take Wellbutrin 450 mg, and Seroquel 100 mg.  This is the ""cocktail"" of meds that have worked for me.  As I said, I have been on this combo of drugs for 3 1/2 years.  Medicine affects everyone differently.  Don't think that just because one person had serious side effects that you will also.  This medicine may be just what you need.  Sometimes you have to trust the doctor more than the reviewers.  The doctors know what the side effects may be.  They are in no way trying to hurt you!  They trying to help you the only way they know how!  Good luck and God bless you!  There is hope, just don't give up!"

This is incorrect, every oen and everybody is different. I started on 25 mg and increased very slowly and STILL got stevens johnson syndrome. i.e. this ""rash"" that they talk about. So that information is misleading. and about the scary info you ""need not see"", exactly the contrary. This is the information I wish i WOULD have known about before i took Lamictal and it changed my life forever, and definitely not for the better. Am in contant pain now after SJS almost claimed my life. Yes, you should all ask your doctor's questions, many questions. But the scary pictures are the truth and what people do need to see. My doctor told me starting out slow and on the 25mg for 1st week, 50 for second and 75mg for 3rd, it could possibly DECREASE the chance, NOT completely eliminate it. Everryone please be careful. Any signs of a ""rash"" puffy swollen eyes or fever headache..ANYTHING like this..please tell your dr. Asap . if you do get the reaction..it may not stop on it's own there is a chance it may have to run its course and won't stop blistering and burning up your body. It also may not stop it from becoming permanently disabling or disfiguring, which happened to me. God Bless you all.

*This medication is not supposed to be given to children 16 and under, as it can increase the risk of you getting the rash. * Please be careful all."

At times, I think I feel even more helpless and depressed as before taking it. I still have the same periods of wanting to stay in bed, being happy one minute and sad the next, and feeling like I hate my life despite having a good life. I also have gained weight because of lack of interest in going to the gym (which I used to go 4-5 times a week) therefore gaining almost ten pounds in three months. At my next psychiatrist visit, I am going to tell him to take me off this drug and try a new one.

But if you start quite slowlly and go up only by 25 mg per week you'll be fine. Start slow.  That's the key to keeping the rash away.  That's the hard part for me because I often forget how many pills to take so I'll update again when I'm on my top dfose and no rash.  If I get the rash I'll let you know.  Just to be fair.  I'm caucasian and they say asians are more prone to get the rash.  I'm quite hopeful for this medication.  I'm only on week 2, 50mg a day, and I'm feeling a difference.  I hope this will be helpful.  Thank everyone! If you're scared of the reash, ask your doctor lots of questions and don't seek it out online, there is scary info and pictures out there that you need not see. I wish I had never sought online info out.  I'll keep you poste4d on what happens to me!  Thanks! Bye!

Has really helped w/ Bi-polar type II, evening out the symtoms (higs & lows) much more effectively than any other phyc. drug I've taken (dealing w/ bi-polar issues for 15+ yrs.)It took 2 months to show positive results but worth the wait!! I take it in combination w/seroquel 50 mgs.per day for sleep.I'm adding lexapro for obsessive negative thoughts that I've been dealing w/ for years - used major trancs.for in the past. One negative side effect was when I first started taking lamictal I actually lost (temporarily) my ability to spell even very simple words. Lamictal does not have any sexual side affects nor does it put you in a stupor like some of the other major players do.

also, i had a small rash.  it went away in two days.

a will admit, it is MORE difficult to sleep.  when i do, i get a RESTFUL sleep, and dont need coffee in the morning.  ( but now, my mornings are 1 pm => )

For the first time in my life I'm assertive, and actually get agitated at times. (I kinda was like Eeyore- nothing could really make me mad, I was just always sad.) This has been an amazing discovery for me, because I finally feel more normal. My friends and family see it too. I'm finally giving normal responses instead of being passive and hiding under my rock. 

No sexual side effects for me. 

One concern I've heard though- is that I display symptoms of mania a bit. I never ever have. I only ever expressed depressed and really depressed. So it's something I keep an eye on. "

381$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/8/2009 9:24:53 PM$Reviewer: tryandtryagain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I am bipolar 2 and have ADD. Lamictal worked for me. I even weaned myself off of it after about 2 years. Now 3 yrs later, that pesky bipolar depression is back and effecting my job, so for insurance reasons, I have been taking the generic version,lamotrogine, which is not as effective as lamictal. I have been on lamotrogine for about a year now (50mg). I get a bad headache if I don't take it on time, I feel like it is not working as well as it did at first and i am slowly becoming a space cadet. Dizzy, forgetful, confused, unmotivated. I have been bipolar for so long and tried soooo many different meds. none of them have been the answer, but lamictal worked the best so far...NOT LAMOTROGINE. Side note on the other meds i have tried: Paxil, Prozac and Wellbutrin =zombie. adderall and ritalin= heart palpatations, major anxiety, shaky, difficulty breathing. (ritalin less bothersome than adderall) Trileptil (oxcarbenzapine)= major allergic reaction (swollen itchy red blistery hands and a rash, but steroids was quickly administered. It wasn't as bad as the other person below. (I feel for you.) I advise when taking any new meds, do it in the daytime when your drs office is open and while someone is with you, just in case of an allergic reaction. A Dr. visit is always cheaper than the emergency room. If you are like me, you just want to feel somewhat productive in this life and not so out of it all the time. Bottom line is that everyone is different and YOU are your best advocate, so speak up and do your research if somethings not working.

I started taking Lamictal in 2002.and almost 7 years later I am still suffering the effects Lamictal has left on me. As a result of taking Lamictal,I developed Stevens Johnson Syndrome...this is the ""rash"" the doctor's might tell you about as a side effect. SJS however is far more than that. If you get this so called ""rash"" from Lamictal...it gives you a reaction that litterally makes your skin peel off and blister and cause your skin to have chemical burns from the inside out. This was an extremely awful and painful experience. I was in the burn center for 6 weeks and gave me a ventilator, because the skin on my lungs was sloughing off as a result of the medication and I couldn't breathe on my own. I would give anything to go back and never have taken Lamictal. Maybe for some people, when you have no other option, you might have to use it as a last resort..but for me their were so many other options. You also have to watch out for swollen lymph nodes this could be a sign that you are getting an allergic reaction. The chemical burns from the Lamictal made it so there were blisters in my eyes and now I have unbearable eye pain and eye problems. My eyes do not look normal I have redness pain, dry eye syndrome,(severe,I have to use eyedrops about 10-20 times a day) photophobia,trichiasis,blepharitis,droopy,swollen eyelids, and constant eye infections because of this. I have scars and have also lost all my fingernails and toenails because I lost my nail beds as a direct result of Lamictal. I also am very sensitive to hot and cold temperature and cannot be out for long periods of time.IMPORTANTIf you get SJS..it MIGHT NOT STOP AFTER YOU STOP THE MEDS... IT MAY HAVE TO RUN ITS COURSE!Now,if you are thinking, this happened to just one of those people who are one out of a million, you are wrong The risk is a lot higher than you think. just please be careful and ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME"

On week two I got a smooth red rash that was very itchy and became worried. I was told it wasn't the ""lamictal rash"" *which would be on my trunk and spread"" and was given some cream. I noticed some acne and now I have devoloped another itchy rash this time small red bumps on my legs, back & chest. I went to the Dr today and was told that ""the lamictal rash is a blister rash"" apply a different Rx cream & ""just keep an eye on it."" I have never had a problem with rashes before taking this medicine and I can't help but think that even though not the life threating oozing ""lamictal rash"" it is still being caused by this medicine."

I started out about 2 years ago at 100mg and since have doubled to 200mg. i am also on Cymbalta and Trazedone for sleep. I'm developing a serious sugar overeating habit.I have also gained weightsince I started on the Lamictal and have not been able to lose it even though I go to the gym 3-4 days a week. I'm not sure the drug is doing any good anymore due to little change in my mood swings and thoughts of suicide though these thoughts come and go quickly. Overall, I think Lamictal was good for me for awhile, but I'm thinking it has started to lose its effectiveness. My doctor says that 200 mg is the highest I can go on it and that's what I'm taking. so I'm a little frustrated.

I was on Seroquel and Zyprexa for years, and although I felt well with those two, I just kept gaining so much weight, going from 190 lbs to 270 lbs in five years.

My bi-polar symptoms started to come back albeit in a manageable way.

It seems that for my doctor he saw this as a good ""excuse"" to put me on Lamictil.  He could not have made a better decision.

It took some time and dosage adjustments and in addition balance this with treating my other issues.

However, I started to lose my weight, and at the same time, my moods have been stable for nearly two years.

Like any other drug, it won't work for everyone, but with my experience with losing my weight and having my moods stabilized this is worth a consideration by you and and your doctor.

The knock down in ease of use is that I need to take two 150 mg for 300 mg.  It may never happen but I would like to see a single 300 mg."

I kinda liked having the hypomania part of the disorder at least then people liked to be around me. I know others have noticed a change in me because they tell me they don't like my attitude, and I have to work with ALOT of people and care for teenagers who are brutally honest. Im sick of explaining myself. I was diagnoised 2months ago and still havent gotten better I cry all the time and Im very angry and I fight with my partner all day every day. I hate how I feel why does it take so long why don't the doctors really listen Im sorry but they are a joke. I don't even know if I agree with them about being bipolar everyone else that knows me and that I have worked with for 7yrs feel im not and just think Im ADHD which that is what I agree with. But no damn doctors won't listen Im really about to bug on them and tell them about themselves Im the one paying them and for what to feel like crap everyday what a joke. I just want to be happy and function and be the best that I can be as a mother, counselor and wife. This medication has sucked the joy out of me which prior to had none anyways but somehow I do feel worse, and this rash thing scares the crap out of me.

ONE NOTE I wanted to add: Recently my Dr. added ""Deplin"" which is Folic Acid - pharmacy grade - as I told him I was starting to not recall the right words, or little wierd things like that. He said that Lamictal can reduce Folic Acid.. So may want to supplement with that!! I am back to feeling real fine."

430$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/1/2009 9:57:05 AM$Reviewer: Me, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was diagnosed Bipolar- II almost two years ago.Lamictal and Zoloft were the first drugs that were prescribed for me. I never felt right on the Zoloft or any SSRI or SNRI for that matter. I got up to the 300mg doses of lamictal and felt it had stopped being as effective as it was in the beginning. This took 1/2 year to poop out. I then started looking for alternatives as my Doc. at the time just wanted me to slowly increase lamictal, yet I felt I needed another med. Well, I went back to my first Doc. that diagnosed me, and tried different meds., but after reading a book called Bi-polar II, from the library I found that the gold standard, for Bi-polar is Lithium Carbonate ER. So I suggested this to my doc. and I have been taking it along with 150mg Lamictal for less than a week. I tell you, I have felt some calmness, and peace with the Lithium add-on already and look forward to more. She only started me at 300mg twice a day. We will do bloodwork soon to see if I need an increase for the theraputic level. I just wanted to pass this along to others, as lithium was the first med. available to treat bipolar and sometimes docs. go with the newer meds. that the drug companies produce. It may have side effects, check them out with your doc. So far though I have been excercising 30min. a day and cutting out gluten and sugars, eating more good carbs. and protein, no weight gain yet. I tell you the side effects may be so minimal for me that I don't feel anything but benefit for Lithium so far. I'll keep you posted.
I am in therapy every two weeks,working part-time, and have a great marriage with two great teenage girls. It isn't easy to make it trough each day, sometimes I force myself to sit back and be thankful for what I do have and have managed to keep up with considering my mental health and lack of sleep, (getting better). Thank you for all of your messages on Web MD, I have read many."

I began at 25 mg and have since moved up to 100 mg daily, a dose that I have been on for just over a month now.  I also take 150 mg Wellbutrin daily.  This combination seems to be working for me.  This is the first medication I have ever taken that has not given me side effects and that in itself makes a wonder drug for me!!  Taking this medication in conjunction with cognitive therapy is now a lifestyle for me and has improved my quality of life dramatically.  I experienced slight weight gain after the first month, but have since been able to maintain my weight through diet and exercise, something i was unable to do while on prozac (which caused horrible weight gain for me).  Both the generic and brand name lamictal are expensive.  if you do not have prescription insurance, go to www.bridgestoaccess.com and see if you qualify for GSK's help.  I qualified and now receive the brand name for free.  This program also includes many other GSK drugs so it is well worth looking into. (I receive my wellbutrin for free as well).  I wish others much success in their endeavour to maintain their bipolar disorder as well.

Kind of makes my anxiety skyrocket. I was okay during the first few weeks on the starter pack.  When I got to the 100mg, I started to notice a difference, and now that I'm on the 150mg, I really notice the side effects. 
Plus, NOTE THIS, I was told I could take Benadryl for the itching and/or simple rash. So I was having one of my many sinus attacks, so I looked through my medicine cabinet and took Benadryl Severe Sinus and Allergy....don't do that!  About an hour after I took it, I started to have nausea, chills and shaking, and a burning feeling in my chest and throat.  I finally passed out, due to what I still don't know.  When I woke up I very shakily drove the mile to my family drs office, and they gave me fluids, but weren't sure what was happening. I was still shaky, so I stopped at my pharmacy on my way home, and talked to the pharmacist. Right away, he informed me that I couldn't take any kind of decongestant with this medicine.  It will cause the same symptoms I went through (which, btw, leaves you with verrry little options.)  When I informed my psych doctor what I had gone through, she looked it up in her medical journal, and NO where did it say that you couldn't take a decongestant, so she was clueless.  I checked with another pharmacy and they automatically said the same as the other.  So I have learned, always talk to your pharmacist first - they are more knowledgeable about the interactions of drugs than anyone!"

It sucks for me, because all the good it does is outweighed by the apathy, lethargy, oversleeping, migraines, and leg/back pain that I believe are related to this medicine. I have had a sick feeling all over since I started this stuff. I'm actually fighting with my doctor because I want to go off this drug. He gives me medicine for the migraines, and Adderall for the lethargy and sleepiness, and it's like I'm trying to use other medicines to cover up the side effects of Lamictal.

I can really see a difference in my personality since I have been on Lamictal. I'm more calm but not sluggish. I do have a concern: Has anyone had any severe abdomen pain that comes ever 2 to 3 months? It's almost like bad cramps but you can't move. I'm not sure that this is related to Lamictal or not. Otherwise, I really love the medicine and have no side effects unless the abdomen pains are. If anyone has had similar symptoms please let me know.

I never felt like it was helping even when I was on Lamictal before the insurance swapped me to the generic. When that happened, I had a spiraling affect into a deeper, darker depression. They doc increased me gradually to 2 pills a nite...when that was full-force in my regimen...I began having problems with my right leg and my lower abdomen (of course that supposedly has NOTHING to do with anything, even tho that was the ONLY thing changed) and my anger and depression increased so drastically that I took myself off the crap! I still have problems with my leg and my abdominal problems are still there, but I've only been off the stuff for 2 weeks. I'm not off ALL my meds, just the 2 I hated...I've kept up with my Lithium and MENTALLY feel 75% better than I did when on the other 2...but of course, there is still a lot of stuff outta whack, just need to try and find a different med for the depression and anger bull.

I'm on Lamictal 150-200mg a day. It varies due to the fact that at 200mg I get horrible migraines. At that point my ARNP will lower my dose to 150mg for a short time and then when I feel ready to live witht the headaches again we bump it back up. This usually only takes me a week or two of being at the lower dose before I want to be bumped back up. Two Hundred mg seems to be just where I need to be at to stabilize me. This to me is a WONDER DRUG. I was suicidal when I started on it. I started on the 5 wk starter pack and by the 3 wk I was feeling sooooooooo much better! I've done nothing but get better each day. I highly recommend it. I've always had a high sex drive but on Lamictal it's even higher, which my husband isn't complaining about! :-) The weight gain that I'm currently expiriencing does bother me and it's extremely hard to try and lose the weight once it's put on. I did try for 3 days to add Topamax w/Lamictal. Bad idea for me. Topamax made me fuzzy and unable to function. With Lamictal, I know now what it's like to be a ""normal"" person, the mood swings are still there but aren't severe anymore. I still have bouts of depression but not like before where I couldn't function at all. I'm now on the generic version and at this time haven't expirienced any adverse effects from switching to it."

I may not have the severity of hallucinations and hyperactivity.  I suffer from the depression way more than mania, I have gone three to four days in bed only to get up to eat and pee.  I started taking lamictal 4 years ago, but since I was self-medicating with illegals, it didn't have an affect.  When I cleaned up, 2 1/2 years ago, I tried again.  It's been a long process, when I wasn't in bed for days before, I never slept.  Still don't, I'm a teeth grinder, vivid dreamer.  But the Lamictal has helped me so much in other ways.  I went from being lost in the woods, never holding a job, I'm 28 and celebrating my first one year anniversary at an employer EVER! to finally feeling good and looking forward to life.  I'm at 400mg a day, supposed to be at night and morning but I have no memory so I take them in the morning.  I'm in college, married to a great man, who excepts me the way I am, and a beautiful daughter.  I still have my moments, when things go wrong, stress, missing work, schoolwork difficulties, but the difference I see in my life is amazing.  I've been put on other drugs in combination that have not worked.  Geodon is terrible!  Respidol, I lactated, look it up, it's a side effect.  And a few others.  I've decided to stick to Lamictal and just deal as long as I can.  I don't go to psych anymore, I was not getting any satisfaction out of my doctors.  We can do this ourselves!!  I would recommend to anyone that they discuss taking Lamictal with their healthcare provider.  And stay away from Geodon, I couldn't even drive on the stuff.

I'd be fine and feel normal for months, sometimes a year at a time an then I'd be horribly anxious for months at a time. My primary cares always tried SSRI's which ALWAYS made me vomit and sent me to the ER. I was nervous about taking this medication but desperate because recently it had gotten to the point of me feeling so disconnected from everything that I was scratching myself just to feel something. I started Lamictal on the smallest starter kit the doctor had. I'm just going into week 5. The only thing I've had a problem with is anxiety. It's not worse but it's still there. But I'll take anxiety that I'm used to over overwhelming depression any day. I have an appointment today with the psychiatrist so maybe she will give me something for anxiety that works. Also, one weird side effect I noticed was this kinda ringing in my ears. It's not really like tinnitus (which I get sometimes)but it's more like when it's so quiet in a room that the quiet is deafening. Not sure if that makes sense but that's how I experience it. It's not a huge problem though. I've also notice a moderate increase in sex drive, which I'm not complaining about.

The longest depression period of depression I have had while on Lamictal has been about 2-3 days. I experienced no side-effects whatsoever.

540$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/26/2008 5:18:48 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I began taking Lamictal 3 years ago for Bipolar dissorder. It has been the only medication, and there have been many, that I can honestly say has made a possitive difference concistantly. Although at times I need another medication as well, Lamictal has given me my life back. It has helped me see the difference between my Bipolar moodswings and authentic feelings. One thing I love about Lamictal is that I NEVER had ANY side effects while taking this medication. My Dr. was genius in putting me on it 3 years ago. Thanx :)

Had a sudden major depressive episode with uncontrollable crying and thoughts of suicide.  Spent 4 out of 5 days in bed.  Started Lamictal, the 25mg kit, taking one pill every other day for two weeks, then one every day for two weeks, then 50mg a day for a week.  Doctor has now prescribed 100mg Lamictal along with 200mg Zoloft after I finish the sample kit.  Halfway into the third week is when I started to feel a slight improvement in my overwhelming depression at 25mg Lamictal daily.  I went from 100mg to 200mg of Zoloft and didn't feel a change until I took it in combination with Lamictal.  I think the side effects such as the insomnia and profuse sweating I'm experiencing is due to the Zoloft. I start the 100mg dose tomorrow.  I hope to see a considerable difference in my depression.

Overall, it has worked and my mood swings are leveled off for the most part. I did develop several rashes when I started taking it, but my doctor said it wasn't related. I am down to one rash on my leg. I am convinced it is from the Lamictal.

They either didnt work, made me worse, or had terrible side effects that I could not tolerate. Lamictal was the only med that made me feel better (for a while) My dose was increased to 400mg which is a very large dose. I was a little better but still very depressed with suicidal thoughts.
I started ECT, and am taking Lamictal as a maintenence medication.  This combination with a mood stabilizer seems to work pretty well.  I still have mixed episodes of mania and depression, but way less often and less severe.  I think Lamictal has less side effects than any of the other meds I have taken, and little to no weight gain. All in all I think it is a good medication for bipolar depression."

It worked good for 8 months then it pooped out. Then i went back because depression  symtoms came back stronger than ever. Then he perscribed effexor xr. While on effexor I lost my job and thought i was loosing my mind i was going crazy. Effexor has dangerious side effects that are terrible for a bi-polar person. I went back. He said that poopout is common with bi-polar people. He wouldnt comment on the effexor side effects. He gave me the bi-polar/seisure drug lamictal. Said it works for both. Been on it for 4 months. Practically no side effects and no more being tired. And feel level headed. Without the manic moods. Even though I liked the up's without the downs. This Lamictal is good stuff. I split my dosage to 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the evening. Works better for me. I give it 5 stars. The depression is 95% gone and the mood swings are 99% gone. Does not help with weight gain. But thats more mind over what you eat. I feel alot better than i have in the last 13 years now. Was a long bumpy road  finding out the right drug. But it works great now.

Took Lamictal with Prozac.  Initial side-effects: sleepiness, no energy, I could feel my head being different for the first couple of weeks, dosage was eventually at 300mg, and was accompanied by severe migraines that would last for days. Dr. felt that counseling would help. I still have headaches, but less frequent and less severe, definately able to deal with. My issues with bi-polar- impulsiveness, sexual mania, 30# wt. loss, suicidal thoughts, sleeplessness, along with major depression. after maybe 6 months or so, dosage felt right, I felt stable, not feeling so out of control. I HATE taking the meds every day.  I was going to wean off once condition was in ""remission"". The two breakdowns each involved a suidide attempt and I have 6 kids. Not a risk I have decided to take. I have probably had earlier episodes, but was undiagnosed until severe breakdown. Breakdowns were majorly stress induced. Never thought I would go there again after first episode, but I did, approximately 8-9 years apart. I hope medication will keep disease and my health and safety safety. I am not at a therapeutic dose of 150mg with 60mg of Prozac. I have been feeling a little of the old sick self, so I may go back up. Everytime I change dose up or down I have sleep issues. Usually inability to sleep followed by sleeping for long periods. If I miss a dose I notice I have sleep issues, although only for a day or two. It takes alot of patience to get to dose that is right for you and finding the anti-depressant that may also be needed. This is a chemical imbalance...no different than high cholestrol, don't be deterred, not everyone has a respect for mental health. It may be what saves your life and give you a quality of life with your family. If not this med, then maybe another. Work with your Dr."

Now that I have resumed treatment, I feel a ton better. This has reassured me that the medication really has made a difference.

I've noticed absolutely no negative side effects and wouldn't trade this RX for the world. Even though it is a bit expensive. I've also noticed that if i forget to take the dose one day, i feel no different. But i never miss more than ONE DAY. This coupled with Lexapro is a great cocktail for me.

For the first 3-6 years it worked very well.  After that it stopped working for me.  Currently, I am coming off the medication.  The most obvious withdrawal issue has been debilitating exhaustion.  It was stimulating for me in the years that it worked.  My doctor said the exhaustion/stimulation is not a common effect.  I think the exhaustion will go away the longer that I am away from using Lamictal.

I have been taking Lamictal with other medications- Trazodone for sleep and various antidepressants (which would tend to make me hypomanic).  Without antidepressants I still had depression.

None of the medications helped my bulemia except possibly zoloft."

I've been on this med for nearly 9 months and as I increase the dose I become more depressed and have constant nausea.

As of today I am stopping this. My partner has been saying to do this for months but I had faith, misplaced. This drug is for epilespsy. If it has any effect on depression it is accidental."

I am less argumenative, not as depressed, and I make less stupid decisions. Now, I still have my moments of mania and depression but they are less defined.
