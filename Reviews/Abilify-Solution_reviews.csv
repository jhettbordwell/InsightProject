1$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$3/7/2014 7:38:55 PM$Reviewer: Zoey Cooley, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$1$I am 15 years and am being treated for depression, along with bipolar disorder. I have been taking this medication for 2 days, and within the first few hours of taking it I was extremely restless and had only gotten about 3 hours of very interrupted sleep. The next morning I was very nauseous and vomited once, and for the rest of the day I felt nauseous. Last night I got a decent amount of sleep but woke up every hour on the hour. There is a constant feeling of nausea on this medication. I also found myself a bit drool-y. Today, unaware of the effects, I drank a Monster Energy drink. Big mistake. I currently feel very shaky, dilated pupils, a general haziness, very cold and blurred vision. I won't be sleeping tonight I'm sure. Essentially, I got every side effect this medication can offer and plan to stop taking it tonight.

When I complained to my doctor and insisted I would not take it, he threw a fit! Then I learned Medicare pays $683 to the drug-maker for this poison. Apparently, my doctor needed me on this drug to pay for the mags on his Porsche. Do NOT take this poison!"

4$Condition: Other$6/23/2012 8:53:04 PM$Reviewer: ocdgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$5$I have severe obsessive compulsive disorder. I had been on Lexapro, AND I was doing well after 2 years I went off it. I was doing well for a few months, and then my OCD spiraled out of control. I started taking Lexapro again 3 weeks ago. Last week I was still doing horribly. My Psychiatrist put me on 2 MG of Abilify and it seemed to kick in for me the next day. I'm not perfect, but my OCD thoughts are much less. I'm not ruminating. I don't have rituals, just obsessive thoughts. They're practically gone in one week. This medicine seems to have done the trick for me thus far. I have just started CBT therapy too. My appetite has increased. I don't know if it's actually from the Abilify.

Totalled my car, and was totally as the neurologist said in an ""altered state"".  Don't know if it was the ability, but I had an MRI, sonograms of carodid artery and heart, tons of blood tests, memory test, eeg.  They found nothing wrong with me.  The only change during that time is taking abilify.  I am 63 with long standing depression, and do not have dementia. They have no idea what caused the problem.  Possibily the Abilify?!"

It made me so weak and shaky.. it was horrible! Everytime I had caffeine it did the same thing.
I took it for a little over a week. The first time I took it I felt drunk. After, it made me weak, gave me very blurry vision, tunnel vision, and made me shaky, which was made worse by the Prozac I took with it for the first few days, but really got bad when I took the excedrin b&b... This drug is just too new."

My doctor prescribed the 30mg tablets right off the bat, and found that After taking it the first day, I found that it rendered me completely useless. Being a  single mom of 3 very young kids, it's imperative that I make it to work , and when I took this it zapped my energy so much that I couldn;t even get out of bed. I broke out in a rash and also began hallucinating. After ta king this for one more day, and getting the same result, i stopped the Abilify. I don't feel I would take it again.

21$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$11/23/2007 9:06:21 AM$Reviewer: Physcho, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I had a terrible expierence with the use of this medication that landed me in the hospital. It actually brought on a serious manic attack when used as a mania prohibitor. My expierence included a massive mania attack, blindness, hallucinations, and the such. Normally I have an extremely high tolerance for all levels of prescription medications, but in this case I would recommend caution and awareness when using to treat bipolar mania..

I have been on the following: Risperdal, Zyprexa, Effexor, Lithium, Depokote and Klonopin with very little results. A 10mg dose finally worked to my satisfaction and I feel much more stable. Please note I am now using Lamictal (30mgs), Geodon (80mgs), Abilify (10mgs) with 2 sleepaids (Trazadone and Ambien). I am concerned about weight  gain however.        "
