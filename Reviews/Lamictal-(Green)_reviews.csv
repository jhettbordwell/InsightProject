0$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/20/2017 7:23:14 PM$Reviewer: Cindy,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$2$2$I've taken many anti depressant drugs for the past 20 years, this was just one of many. I took it about 2 years when I noticed I started falling from being dizzy and had a foggy brain. My memory was bad and I was starting to have cognitive decline where I went to a neurologist and had an MRI of my brain looking for signs of Parkinsans disease, which was negative. I felt numb and not at all like myself. When I fell on a up escalator at the airport my myself, my psychiatrist took me off of it and now I feel so much better, more like myself and I can think clearly now. The long term effects of anti depressant meds can be dangerous but with bi polar what else could I do. I still take Zoloft and Wellbutrin.  The Lamictol worked for awhile but then it came down to not being good for me.  The benefits didn't outweigh the negative effects.
