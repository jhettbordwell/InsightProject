The insomnia side effect is horrendous. Even with adding Ambien to the mix, I still would watch the sun rise. Also, the depersonalization side effect is pretty bad. I just didn't care about anything, and my passion for art was completely gone.

I won't ever take this medicine again. "

3$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/12/2018 8:10:36 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$My response is to Susie! She began at a very high dose 100 mg. Lamictal has a black box warning. You need to carefully titrate up on it. Otherwise, you will get the famous Lamictal Rash. I cannot believe anyone would prescribe Lamictal like that carelessly to a patient!! I started out at 25 mg adding 25 each week till I got to my Theraputic Dose of 300 mg. Began when I was 45 and off and on ( I felt better, so I stopped, good grief!) I'm now 64 and glad to be back on the drug. It's great. Takes awful, is my only complaint.
4$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/27/2018 10:31:17 PM$Reviewer: Jlb85, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking this medication for about a year and it's been very effective for me. It helps me feel more steady and stable, and avoid the constant highs and lows of bipolar. My doctor upped my dose when I began a severe bout of sleepwalking after coming off a strong sleep med. After increasing lamotrigine I stopped sleepwalking. My experience with the med has been nothing but good. 
5$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/16/2018 4:21:54 PM$Reviewer: Suzie, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"I hate this medication! I'm 48 and was diagnosed as BP2 4 months ago. Started this med at 100mg, 2 weeks later, 150mg, 3 weeks later 200mg. I""ve had no sleep since starting this med. Because I've had such a horrific time sleeping, I've been so close to loosing my mind. Having hot flashes like crazy, had them slightly before due to being postmenopausal, but even then it was doable because I was not up all night tossing and turning. No sleep, weeping, and worsened depression. Actually thought I'd rather be dead. This sucks!!!!! I am weaning myself off, not sure I will trust any doctor after taking this shit. I was better off on Prozac, at least I didn't want to bite my spouse's head off, nor did I feel like I just wanted to die. This med has made me Bipolar! It's been the worst 4 months of my life, glad I'm still here to tell you not to take this. I quit my job, I nearly lost my marriage which was a gamble I was not prepared to take. Do not take this at high dosages if you can't handle it at the low dosage, you are taking a chance on making your  condition worse."

7$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/13/2018 11:35:50 AM$Reviewer: DonnaRanetta, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$3$I just started this medication like 2 days ago. I just got diagnosed as bipolar and iâ??ve been suffering with depression for 10 years now. It started when I was 25 yrs old. I was told by my Dr to take this medication at night with my antidepressant which is Celexa. Iâ??ve been experiencing major headaches that lasts all day, nausea, vomiting and upset stomach. On top of that, I canâ??t sleep well. It had me up all night tossing and turning. Come Monday morning Iâ??m calling my Dr and hope she DC this and try me on something else. 
8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/24/2017 11:15:24 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken this medication for over 7 years now and  have found it to be very effective in treating my bipolar II.  I have not had any side effects (which is odd since with most meds that I have tried over the years nausea and stomach issues are usually the side effect that i get the most frequently).  When my Doctor and I finally came up with the medicine combo that worked for me I had been in a pretty rough state for over 2 years

12$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/4/2017 7:16:19 AM$Reviewer: Stomach pain and diarrhea! , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$I weaned myself off a heavy dose of zoloft after about 4 years. Depression just seemed out of control and just different. Got the bipolar depression diagnosis and started a low dose (25 MG daily at night) of lamotrigine. It's only been 4 days, my moods are definitely better but I have had the worst stomach cramping and diarrhea since the morning after my first dose. Here it is, 4:00 in the morning and I have been up all night with terrible stomach pains and diarrhea every hour. Please tell me this goes away soon!!
13$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/1/2017 12:59:07 PM$Reviewer: jane, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$"I approached my doctor requesting treatment for ADHD and left with a prescription for generic lamotrigine to manage my moods.  I'm not bipolar, though; if anything I'm depressed, but my doctor latched onto the fact that once, about four years ago, I had a single and isolated ""manic-like"" episode that has never happened again.  

I've only been taking this a few months and have had my dosage increased once (25mg to start, 50mg currently). I realize that generally people don't experience any real change until the dosage is significantly higher, but if anything my ""mood disorder"" is worse and I've experienced several side effects since starting treatment with this.  

I'm more irritable and my already limited patience and temper are easier to lose than ever, to the point of rage, restlessness, and wanting to hurt people.  My nose has been congested for months in a way that has nothing to do with the season or allergies.  I have a constant minor headache and dry eyes--for a while, my upper eyelids would periodically twitch, but that stopped when my dose increased.  My skin is more sensitive and I'm ore prone to irritation than I was.  I already had issues with menstruation and they've gotten worse.    As I type this, I have a tightness in my chest that's only happened since I started taking lamotrigine.  I've had issues with urination, from not going enough and having difficulty going to needing to go so immediately I'm lucky I make it to the bathroom.  I'm fatigued and have occasionally severe insomnia and nightly vivid, sometimes upsetting dreams.  I have the same issues with concentration that I've always had, but I've become prone to trailing of mid-thought and misspeaking or being outright incoherent.  I'm not well-coordinated to begin with, but I've gotten worse as my grip has gotten weaker and my balance is off (I even walk differently now to compensate.  

My doctor insists I stay on and up my dose again to see if things change.  I don't want to take the chance."
14$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/3/2016 5:55:55 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This has changed my life. I have been taking this for over three years and my wife continues to tell me how much of a difference she can tell in the severity of my mood swings. I really like the fact that I still feel myself when taking this medication.

16$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/6/2016 3:39:52 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$5$4$"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II early this year after some years of being misdiagnosed with plain ol' depression.  One way I differ from the usual B2 person is that I've never really had suicidal thoughts - except on the Citalopram and Trazodone I'd been prescribed for depression!  I worked my way up on the Lamotrigine from 25mg daily to my current 200, with zero side effects, and a marked improvement in my mental state after about two months.  Unless your early experiences are really bad, as mine were with the SSRIs, be patient and let ""Vitamin L"" work its magic.  It's not perfect and my mood swings haven't completely disappeared, but I'm a lot easier to live with now, sleep better and am more optimistic.  I'll gladly take this for the rest of my life if that's what it takes.  It should be noted that I also quit drinking and smoking pot this year, and I'm sure there were many cross-benefits from that."

19$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/18/2016 2:40:51 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II and Dysthimic Disorder about a month ago and was prescribed Lamictal (Lamotrigine). I'm now taking 100 mg a day and have gradually seen an awesome change. My mood swings aren't as extreme and it's helped a lot with the depressive symptoms as well. 
20$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/1/2016 2:39:45 PM$Reviewer: Trinity, 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$1$This is one of the most difficult drugs to stop taking. I've been stepping down from 200mg/day over the last 3 years. 10 mg at a time. Takes a month of feeling like a complete idiot, with lots of drowsiness for me to start feeling better after reducing the dose... then you need another couple of months to restabilize. Glaxo lied in their first data sheet about effectiveness. Turns out that Lamictal/Lamotrigine is less effective than placebo. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. 
21$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/1/2016 11:05:31 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been on this drug for a year just in the last 3 mos my dose was raise to 250 a day as I began feeling very manic.

22$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/30/2016 10:18:08 PM$Reviewer: britbrit05tx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$4$I'm on week two of 25mg of this pill. In three days I will go up to 50 mg. the only change I've seen in my behavior is that it has gotten worse. I become irritated much easier than I did before I started taking this medication. I was diagnosed with bi polar and anxiety agitation. I hope there is a way to review again once my doses become higher. I'm giving this med a chance in hopes that it will help.
23$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/6/2016 6:01:45 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$3$BP2. Coming off lithium I found myself more energetic and dynamic. At first I was having some serious suicidal ideation, but that passed. Now the problem is that I'm beset by a feeling of bleakness, on occasion. It's not entirely like depression, being without emotion or fear.
24$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/8/2015 12:04:44 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$After quite a few years of a misdiagnosis and treatment for depression and/or ADD, I was accurately diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed Lamotrigine.  I have been taking 300mg for almost 10 years now, and I am thrilled with the level of stability I have experienced over these years.  Overall I'm very happy with my experience with this medication.
25$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/15/2015 11:40:23 PM$Reviewer: Zach, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This is the first medication that has truly worked for my bipolar. Beforehand, I had bounced around many SSRI's and Anti-psychotics all to no avail. My psychiatrist finally decided to start me on Lamotrigine and since then, my quality of life has significantly improved. I now take 300mg/day and am very impressed with the results.
26$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/26/2015 7:17:44 AM$Reviewer: Patient , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$Went off celexa for anxiety. Slowly worked up to 200 mg. felt like I was going to jump out of my skin with the first 200mg dose. It seems 9 hours after I take it I become very nauseous, and have diarrhea. Wake up out of a dead sleep, feel like I have the stomach flu. Cut down to 100mg, still feeling like that. First they gave me Lamasil (sp) to ease into full strength then the full dose was lamotrigine. No effects with Lamasil. Woke up this morning feeling sick, now I have a slight rash on my face and body.
27$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/13/2015 4:18:54 AM$Reviewer: Fiona, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I am lucky that I have not had any side effects from this medication. For me it took a number of months to build up the effective dosage of 200mg per day.  However, despite the improvement due to Lamotrigine my mood (due to Bipolar II) has still been unstable.  So now I have just started on Seroquel XR.  Good luck and good health to all of you with bipolar disorder and remember MENTAL HEALTH IS TRICKY
28$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/24/2014 8:31:23 AM$Reviewer: emme, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$After trying several medications that either didn't work or resulted in negative side-effects, lamotrigine has been working for me. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is because I have been at 200mg for less than a month and before I was at 100mg BUT I have noticed a difference with the increased dose and never a side-effect.
29$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/7/2014 9:58:35 AM$Reviewer: squeakycellist, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$After 12 years of misdiagnosed bipolar depression and heavy side effects from fluoxetine and citalopram my new psychiatrist cured me in 6 weeks with lamotrigine. I wish this had happened years ago! First week I had tremors and the second-third my insomnia worsened, but symptoms subsided after 2-3 weeks. It really works!
30$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/24/2014 8:31:17 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$"I have taken this drug since 2009; I was lucky that the first drug I tried for my mental illness has been so effective. I take 300 mg once a day. 

Though it is technically prescribed for manic depression (for insurance coverage/medical reasons) it is actually for Borderline Personality Disorder. 

It brings me, and my doctor, a lot of hope, because it is commonly believed that personality disorders cannot be helped with medication. My moods are more stable, and even though it hasn't had any 'magic effect', it's given me the foundation to work on my own problems without constantly feeling like my world is collapsing around me.

Warning for women: the interactions with birth control are VERY REAL. I spent a year and a half trying various combinations under my doctor's supervision, and every hormonal birth control option literally made me the most crazy I've been in my life-- crying constantly, suicidal, flipping out. I chose, in fact, to seek sterilization at a young age (for many reasons, but my need to stay on Lamotrogine is one of the primary ones).

As far as long term side effects, my hands shake noticeably at times, and it seems like my balance is a bit worse, though that might just be the effect of aging. It is also incredibly difficult and distressing to miss a dose: headaches, dizziness, and extreme mood swings.

Despite all of this, I am incredibly grateful for this drug. I didn't believe that a psych drug could ever change my life like this. It takes awhile to begin its effects but I would give it a chance if you have mood swing issues-- just take it consistently, at the same time each day."

41$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/25/2013 10:30:41 PM$Reviewer: MadKate, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $4$5$2$I have taken Lamotrigine for 12 years now. Most of all, it seems to level my moods.  I take 400 mg at bedtime, along with 100mg of Zoloft, and during the day I take 300mg of Welbutrin. I wouldn't say I'm on top of the world, but I am in a stable place. The main concern I have is a side effect no one has reported. If I skip a dose, I start to have fuzzy thinking and feel uncoordinated. If I forget to take it at night, I have a very hard time waking up and I feel awful. If I go to work after skipping a dose, I have to have someone bring it to me, so that I won't get disoriented and anxious. I don't like that aspect of this drug at all. I've been on it long enough to know that these side effects are produced by Lamotrigine, not another medication.

After about 6 great months, I started thinking that I was just so ok ... and that the bi-polar stuff was all in my mind and a missdiagnosis by the doctor.

I quite taking it ... was great for a month ... and then WHAM ... major depression.  Right now I am trying to cope with a hypomanic state (just yesterday I did something potentially hurtful & feel just terrible about it today) while I wait to once again reach the theraputic dose.

I learned my lesson!! I will never agin get off this wonder drug!!

I hope that someone who is successfully taking this drug will read this and learn from my bad experience.  STAY ON YOUR MEDS!!

""oh, it'll work pretty soon, just wait until you get a higher dosage."" funny story, i'm at 200mg and it does absolutely nothing. it's inhibited a lot of my creativity and taken out a big chunk of my mental capacity, but it really hasn't done anything. i still have suicidal ideation, and the only thing stopping me is not wanting to hurt my family. however, if depressed enough, that does not matter because my body automatically tries to end it's suffering, so it's really very important that i have something blocking all levels of depression. all it does is stop me from being manic, which, personally, i'd rather be manic all the time than depressed. now i have to stop cold turkey because my psych canceled my appointment, and i've been off one day and have started hearing voices and feeling presences at night and having panic attacks. i don't know, this might mean i'm schizoaffective but whatever. this drug was a pain to get on (constant nausea, pounding headaches, and at times severe crippling depression) and at this point my body has developed a very strong aversion to taking it. im going to a new psych next week to get evaluated. this drug sucks."

Until the dose steadied out I felt unsteady, even worse than unmedicated. After getting to the therapeutic dose and staying there for a while, things got better. My wife notices an enormous difference. I still am occasionally hypomanic, but any depression I have is very short-lived and not as severe as before. This is not a good drug for children, from what I read.
60$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/12/2012 8:38:57 AM$Reviewer: deadladytalking, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$After trying several antidepressants and lithium, the doctor prescribed lamotrigine/lamictal and wellbutrin/bupropion which has helped alot. lithium didn't help at all and caused rapid weight gain once i reached 1000mg (theraptutic level)and thyroid problems and was still depressed even depite trying celexa, citopram, and wellbutrin combined with the lithium. discouraged, i went in and asked to be taken off my drugs and she said to try this before making such a hasty decision and it worked! lamictal took away my anger/aggression and depression slightly so she prescribed wellbutrin to help with the depression and it was a life changer! it takes a while to reach a theraputic level (over a month) but with each week, i felt better. what people have to remember is that each drug effects different neurotransmitters in your brain and each person is different. plus, people are more likely to review when they're disatisfied, rather than happy so that also screws witht he rating. I say try it and see if it helps! I take mine before i want to go to sleep and you do get drowsy but when i wake up that doesn't effect me as much. wellbutrin is also a stimulant so that may be another factor. start with a low dose (25mg) and increase weekly by 25 mg to lessen the chance of getting the rash which is rare. before this drug, i wanted to kill myself and was very angry and depressed despite being on lithium which most bipolar people find effective; just not me. each person is different. be willing to try different drugs or combinations and be patient because there is a theraptuic level you have to reach.

Noticed a difference in just 2 days off limictal so must have been the med. Starting new med today, hope it goes well!

I moved to Lamictal/Lamotrigine as per my Pdoc. As I moved up in dosage I began to notice that I no longer had issues w/getting out of bed or feeling suicidal. I no longer felt the need or want to drink, I could sit in bars w/my buddies and be happy w/out having a round or two or five! I no longer looked for sex everywhere I could find it.

Within an hour after I take it I have to shut my eyes and put my head down. But I can't take it at night because whenever I do, I don't sleep, despite being very tired. It's odd. 

I initally got prescribed this as a mood stabalizer. I get hypo-manic, and was never willing to get on a mood stabalizer untill I realized the older I get, the worse my depressions get. So my prescriber told me that lamictal would keep my depressions from getting SOO low, and keep my mania from getting TOO high. 

I don't really know if it's working, because I still get pretty depressed for long periods of time. Many just not as bad as it use to be, but not really noticeable either. I find myself unable to take this medication, unless I have a few hours in my day free where I know I don't have to exert myself or keep my eyes open. Waste of frickin time. "

Unlike some others, it has worked well in controlling my symptoms. I feel balanced. I experienced multiple major depressive events starting in my 30's which I treated by indulging in alcohol. Eventually I tried every SSRI on the market, Wellbutrin, Trazadone and several others. These made me manic and caused severe insomina. After taking lamotrigine for a couple or years, I began having panic attacks. My doctor added Xanax. It was the perfect combination and the most effective treatment to date. One thing is important - don't use drugs or alcohol if you expect to get the full benefits of this product. I haven't had a drink for 3+ years and this was the key to achieving maximum effectiveness. Substance abuse is a problem with many of us with bipolar depression. If that is a factor, you have to deal with that as part of the treatment plan. Not always easy to do, but worth it. I was teetering between a good life and losing it all. I didn't lose my life. Identifying the right combination of drugs and a good psychiatrist is key to finding the right thing for you. I take 300 mg per day - 150 mg morning and night with 50 mg Xanax at the same time. No side effects.

I finally felt motivated to get out of bed and do things, which usually didn't happen at all unless I had a structured event to go to.  I could get up and get going for specific situations and then I would fall back into a slump.  It is an amazing feeling to want to get up and not have to drag myself out of bed.  I was still experiencing bouts of tearfulness on a daily basis--which I almost didn't mind because I finally felt better for the most part.  I was recently prescribed Geodon to help with this, only I don't notice much of a difference--if any.  I have learned that this is just the kind of thing I really need to communicate with my doctor on.  Until you find something that actually works sometimes you feel bad because you are taking a medication and you can't really tell if it is doing anything.  That was not the case with Lamictal for me.  I am afraid I will have to take it my whole life and it is really expensive.  I don't want to go off it since it helps, only depending upon my insurance coverage I may not be able to afford staying on it.

I felt very calm. I was easy to get along with and had so little anxiety that I had no fear even when in situations that normally made me go into panic attack mode. However, I was always tired and exhausted my entire life before taking this drug. So when on this drug I was so tired that I could only sit and stare and not get much done during my day. I was in a zombie like state. Also it made me exrtremely forgetful. I missed 4 appointments in 2 months and I NEVER forget appts. I was just NOT motivated to do anything. It might be great for you if you have no probs with energy level. But for me the side effects were not worth it. I was taken off of it and use the aplenzin ER 348 for ADHD and it helps with Biolar depression as well.

I started this medicine 4 years ago and have suffered insomnia ever since. I was prescribed to take it at night. 3 years ago the insomnia became worse- lasting up to 4-5 days at a time.  I NEVER SHUT DOWN - not even the following day.  I tried everything on the market: behavioral modification (dark room, etc), all the drugs listed on this website for insomnia. Finally, after forgetting to take it for a couple of nights, I was able to sleep normally.  I tried, as a last resort, to take it in the morning only - AND TO MY RELIEF AND ELATION MY INSOMNIA WAS CURED! I take the medicine first thing in the morning now and it gives me a the same buzz as taking vitamin B.  I am tired at night like I am supposed to be and sleep like a baby.  I actually dream now whereas before I laid awake all night listening to every sound.  Apparantly, because this side effect is so rare - no doctor I saw could identify the cause of my insomnia.  I write this for those of you out who suffered like me with insomnia for years with no relief.

Took about 6 months for depression to catch me again.Then they put me on Wellbutrin which was horrible because I was a zombie. Now they have me on lamotrogine to ""get me back on track"". As others have mentioned here, I have that dizzy, headache and overall tired feeling thats now effecting my job.

It became acute in the beginning of February -- extremem vertigo (falling, vomiting) and horrible headaches.  I have missed so much work that I am now on STD until it gets under control.  After multiple (expensive) tests I am now seeing a (??? balance PT) to retrain my brain.  It didn't even occur to me (or any of the doctors) that this drug may be the cause until I went for my pre-scheduled follow-up appointment with my psychiatrist who subscribed the drug.  the Dr. is now titrating me off the drug within the next 10 days.  I am bummed because Lamictal worked so well (after suffering for over 20 years) and I am told it could take me up to three months to re-train my brain to regain my balance and stop this vertigo!!

169$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/2/2008 1:48:20 PM$Reviewer: believer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken this medication for over 2 years. It has been a God-send. I have been bi-polar for over 30 years and this is the best medication ever. I used to take lithium which required blood tests once a month due to the fine line between toxic and theraputic levels. So, sometimes, I would go off of it because it was such a hassle. But with lamictal, I don't have to worry about that. I have not experienced any side effects. I am also taking effexor to control the depression. The combination of both of these meds has been a real blessing. I have never felt better. I would encourage any one who has been diagnosed with manic-depression or bipolar illness to talk to their doctor about lamictal.

I began taking Lamictal after being diagnosed for agitated depression. I started on the sample kit prescribed to me from my psychiatrist. 13 days into beginning the starter kit my Lymph nodes began to swell. I got a red itchy rash all over my body. I didnt begin to think this was a serious problem until my fever reached 105 degress F. I was taken into ER and the red rash was all over my body. The pain in my lymph nodes was so bad that i was precribed darvocet for the pain. The symptoms died down after a week. The ER stated I had a strepp infection and was given an amoxocilin antibiotic. After completing the antibiotic I was told by my Psych to begin taking the Lamictal at day 14 were I left off. I took the Lamictal at 830 in the morning by 10 am I was taken to the ER for an alergic reaction. I am partial to all medications for I can help people however, This particular medication almost landed me in my death bed...
Good luck"
