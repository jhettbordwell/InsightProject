The insomnia side effect is horrendous. Even with adding Ambien to the mix, I still would watch the sun rise. Also, the depersonalization side effect is pretty bad. I just didn't care about anything, and my passion for art was completely gone.

I won't ever take this medicine again. "

3$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$5/29/2019 2:54:37 PM$Reviewer:  Male  (Patient) $4$4$5$It is almost too early for me to review but so far it’s been nothing but good. No issues so far but it’s just under a week of me being on the drug.. no noticeable difference, nothing shocking anyway. Regular marijuana user who was told to quit because of it and I see why now... since being on this drug (not the pot) I’ve been sleeping BETTER and it helps with the pot... I’m a-ok with this. As far as stopping seizures go, so far so good but like I said it hasn’t been long. 
4$Condition: Manic-Depression$4/2/2019 7:00:40 PM$Reviewer: Sophie, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Iâ??m a 23 year old female who was diagnosed with bipolar II two years ago. I had struggled with taking different medications and was concerned about side effects of anti psychotics that might dull creativity, make me feel foggy or gain weight. On lamotrogine I have experienced none of these side effects whatsoever. It takes a little while to work after titrating up slowly (I started at 25mg and now take 400) but it has honestly been amazing. I no longer have mood swings or depression, my mind is far more rational, my concentration has tripled. I know different medications work for different people but I think lamotrogine is worth giving a go and sticking at it while you titrate up. If it works as it has done for me youâ??ll have no side effects. My quality of life has improved and I hope others can benefit in the same way.

8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/12/2018 8:10:36 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$My response is to Susie! She began at a very high dose 100 mg. Lamictal has a black box warning. You need to carefully titrate up on it. Otherwise, you will get the famous Lamictal Rash. I cannot believe anyone would prescribe Lamictal like that carelessly to a patient!! I started out at 25 mg adding 25 each week till I got to my Theraputic Dose of 300 mg. Began when I was 45 and off and on ( I felt better, so I stopped, good grief!) I'm now 64 and glad to be back on the drug. It's great. Takes awful, is my only complaint.

I have energy, a clear head, but a lot of irritability (side effect?) No physical side effects @ 200mg/day. I wish I had been prescribed this drug 20 years ago.  Thanks to lithium, I have kidney damage and must have 2 parathyroid glands removed.

It helps me feel more steady and stable, and avoid the constant highs and lows of bipolar. My doctor upped my dose when I began a severe bout of sleepwalking after coming off a strong sleep med. After increasing lamotrigine I stopped sleepwalking. My experience with the med has been nothing but good. 
11$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/16/2018 4:21:54 PM$Reviewer: Suzie, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"I hate this medication! I'm 48 and was diagnosed as BP2 4 months ago. Started this med at 100mg, 2 weeks later, 150mg, 3 weeks later 200mg. I""ve had no sleep since starting this med. Because I've had such a horrific time sleeping, I've been so close to loosing my mind. Having hot flashes like crazy, had them slightly before due to being postmenopausal, but even then it was doable because I was not up all night tossing and turning. No sleep, weeping, and worsened depression. Actually thought I'd rather be dead. This sucks!!!!! I am weaning myself off, not sure I will trust any doctor after taking this shit. I was better off on Prozac, at least I didn't want to bite my spouse's head off, nor did I feel like I just wanted to die. This med has made me Bipolar! It's been the worst 4 months of my life, glad I'm still here to tell you not to take this. I quit my job, I nearly lost my marriage which was a gamble I was not prepared to take. Do not take this at high dosages if you can't handle it at the low dosage, you are taking a chance on making your  condition worse."

I just got diagnosed as bipolar and iâ??ve been suffering with depression for 10 years now. It started when I was 25 yrs old. I was told by my Dr to take this medication at night with my antidepressant which is Celexa. Iâ??ve been experiencing major headaches that lasts all day, nausea, vomiting and upset stomach. On top of that, I canâ??t sleep well. It had me up all night tossing and turning. Come Monday morning Iâ??m calling my Dr and hope she DC this and try me on something else.

I have not had any side effects (which is odd since with most meds that I have tried over the years nausea and stomach issues are usually the side effect that i get the most frequently).  When my Doctor and I finally came up with the medicine combo that worked for me I had been in a pretty rough state for over 2 years  
18$Condition: Other$11/6/2017 12:49:01 PM$Reviewer: Mom of 3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I went to see a doctor to see if I could find a medication that could help with my constant irritability and depression.  This wasn't what I was anticipating when I went in there, but I have been taking it for about 3 months now, and it works fantastic!  The irritability is just gone, like vanished, and I can respond to stressful situation calmly.  I feel normal, and I wish I had started taking this YEARS ago because this is how I wish I had always felt.  It definitely wouldn't work the same for everyone, but I love how it is working for me.

My doctors have me on 700mg a day and I have had 2 accidental over doses because I was late taking the dose by maybe 45min to hour. Before I started taking this 4 years ago I didn't have any type of depression or anxiety issues. I now have manic bipolar depression and server anxiety. i have had 2 miscarriages because of this drug, the doctor never let me know it was unsafe for conception. So till they can ween me off and stabilize me with someone safer, I can't have any childern. If you have just a seizure condition I HIGHLY advise you not to take this pill.

I honestly believe this has saved my life. Nothing seemed to work until this. I'm now 33 years old. I've struggled since I was in my teens.

Depression just seemed out of control and just different. Got the bipolar depression diagnosis and started a low dose (25 MG daily at night) of lamotrigine. It's only been 4 days, my moods are definitely better but I have had the worst stomach cramping and diarrhea since the morning after my first dose. Here it is, 4:00 in the morning and I have been up all night with terrible stomach pains and diarrhea every hour. Please tell me this goes away soon!!
26$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/1/2017 12:59:07 PM$Reviewer: jane, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$"I approached my doctor requesting treatment for ADHD and left with a prescription for generic lamotrigine to manage my moods.  I'm not bipolar, though; if anything I'm depressed, but my doctor latched onto the fact that once, about four years ago, I had a single and isolated ""manic-like"" episode that has never happened again.  

I've only been taking this a few months and have had my dosage increased once (25mg to start, 50mg currently). I realize that generally people don't experience any real change until the dosage is significantly higher, but if anything my ""mood disorder"" is worse and I've experienced several side effects since starting treatment with this.  

I'm more irritable and my already limited patience and temper are easier to lose than ever, to the point of rage, restlessness, and wanting to hurt people.  My nose has been congested for months in a way that has nothing to do with the season or allergies.  I have a constant minor headache and dry eyes--for a while, my upper eyelids would periodically twitch, but that stopped when my dose increased.  My skin is more sensitive and I'm ore prone to irritation than I was.  I already had issues with menstruation and they've gotten worse.    As I type this, I have a tightness in my chest that's only happened since I started taking lamotrigine.  I've had issues with urination, from not going enough and having difficulty going to needing to go so immediately I'm lucky I make it to the bathroom.  I'm fatigued and have occasionally severe insomnia and nightly vivid, sometimes upsetting dreams.  I have the same issues with concentration that I've always had, but I've become prone to trailing of mid-thought and misspeaking or being outright incoherent.  I'm not well-coordinated to begin with, but I've gotten worse as my grip has gotten weaker and my balance is off (I even walk differently now to compensate.  

My doctor insists I stay on and up my dose again to see if things change.  I don't want to take the chance."

I have to say, this has been a life changing experience! I've been dealing with depression/anxiety for many years, but the last 5 or so have been horrible.  Suicidal thoughts daily, dark holes, panic attacks, at least 5 a day.  For the last week, it's like climbing out of a shell.  I AM ME AGAIN!

I've tried this med in the past but stopped taking it for some reason...so anyway after years of just not being myself I decided to try to take it again and it has been a blessing. I had no side effects and remain on 100mg. This med has changed my life and have accepted the fact that I will need to take this med for the rest of my life. Thank you doc!

I am now on remission and I know I must take this medication for life.

One way I differ from the usual B2 person is that I've never really had suicidal thoughts - except on the Citalopram and Trazodone I'd been prescribed for depression!  I worked my way up on the Lamotrigine from 25mg daily to my current 200, with zero side effects, and a marked improvement in my mental state after about two months.  Unless your early experiences are really bad, as mine were with the SSRIs, be patient and let ""Vitamin L"" work its magic.  It's not perfect and my mood swings haven't completely disappeared, but I'm a lot easier to live with now, sleep better and am more optimistic.  I'll gladly take this for the rest of my life if that's what it takes.  It should be noted that I also quit drinking and smoking pot this year, and I'm sure there were many cross-benefits from that."

I've been stepping down from 200mg/day over the last 3 years. 10 mg at a time. Takes a month of feeling like a complete idiot, with lots of drowsiness for me to start feeling better after reducing the dose... then you need another couple of months to restabilize. Glaxo lied in their first data sheet about effectiveness. Turns out that Lamictal/Lamotrigine is less effective than placebo. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Over a year later, it’s still working well.  With the Lamotrigine bolstering the positive effects of the Brintellix even more, I’ve felt genuinely happy, not just “non-depressed.”  I take 50mg in the morning and 25mg in the afternoon.  Considering I had tried over fifteen other medications in various combinations to treat my depression, I was surprised to find that this is working.  My tiredness doesn’t seem to be going away, but at least I have my emotions back!  I haven’t experienced any major side effects either, which is in huge contrast to how other pills could tear me apart.  If you’re still looking for the right medicine, don’t give up hope.  It took me a while, but I finally found one.

The reaction was even worse. I did some research and learned that, while uncommon, when lamotrigine does have an adverse effect, it is a serious one. My reaction appeared within 30 minutes of taking it and manifested as the worst flu ever - violent vomiting, severe migraine, uncontrollable chills and shaking, and dangerously low blood pressure. In the following two weeks I was confused, light-headed, and very weak. It took over two weeks for my blood pressure to return to normal. These episodes surprised (and terrified) me, because not only was this a low dose, but I have never before had a bad reaction to a medication. ANY drug has the potential to do harm as well as good. That doesn't mean you should not try taking something; it just means you need to be aware of the possibility, AND you need to trust your own instincts. Never allow a ""professional"" to tell you how you feel, just because he or she has not encountered it before. "

I had some symptoms the first couple days w/headache,blurred vision etc but my days using that med ended on day 6 when that itching burning rash came on with a vengeance--head to toe--looked like a 5 foot tall purplish red snake skin covered my whole body and the swollen eyelids so severe I could  barely see also my tongue sooo sore I still am not able to eat anything that is not bland.  Hasn't done a thing for the vertigo but it sure gave me something else to think about--now I am taking Prednisone to try to counteract the negative effects.  Don't buy the generic--This rash is dangerous and yes Your throat will swell.  Fortunately I stopped the med before I needed the ER.

I've been taking it for about four years and for the first time since puberty I have been almost completely  stable.

Problem is after being on it for 2 months and titrated up to 100mg I ended up getting the ""rash"". Normally they say it happens within the first few days or weeks but after reading reviews and forums I think they lie about the rarity of the rash. So I had to stop cold turkey and go to the urgent care. Epinephrine pills and benadryl and it won't be out of my system for two weeks. Oh well I guess. It was a nice emotional vacation. I won't miss the horrible dry mouth it gives though. As for a recommendation... That's a double edged sword. Yes it does wonders for anxiety but the side effects and the rash it causes is awful! Oh and if you go to a doctor and tell them it's a rash from lamotrigine they tend to panic a bit. That doesn't give me a whole lot of confidence in the medication. Definitely use at your own risk I guess. "

Wake up out of a dead sleep, feel like I have the stomach flu. Cut down to 100mg, still feeling like that. First they gave me Lamasil (sp) to ease into full strength then the full dose was lamotrigine. No effects with Lamasil.

I had to call manufacture because my doctor said that my allergic reaction was all in my head from fear of the side effects. If it was all in my head than I wouldn't have a physical reaction that you can see with your eyes! Manufacture had me call my doctor and tell him I was having reactions listed on the warnings and to call my doctor back and tell him that I spoke with them. I had a bad reaction and to make things worse, I had a new psychiatrist telling me it was all in my head even though he said to watch for it as a precaution. He has hundreds of patients on it and they never had a problem on it. Manufacture said, everybody is different and reacts differently. this doctor didnt even have me come back in and look at it and said to take Benadryl, go to the family doctor or hospital if I wanted to. Unfortunately, I had a very bad experience all around.

70$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/24/2014 8:31:17 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$"I have taken this drug since 2009; I was lucky that the first drug I tried for my mental illness has been so effective. I take 300 mg once a day. 

Though it is technically prescribed for manic depression (for insurance coverage/medical reasons) it is actually for Borderline Personality Disorder. 

It brings me, and my doctor, a lot of hope, because it is commonly believed that personality disorders cannot be helped with medication. My moods are more stable, and even though it hasn't had any 'magic effect', it's given me the foundation to work on my own problems without constantly feeling like my world is collapsing around me.

Warning for women: the interactions with birth control are VERY REAL. I spent a year and a half trying various combinations under my doctor's supervision, and every hormonal birth control option literally made me the most crazy I've been in my life-- crying constantly, suicidal, flipping out. I chose, in fact, to seek sterilization at a young age (for many reasons, but my need to stay on Lamotrogine is one of the primary ones).

As far as long term side effects, my hands shake noticeably at times, and it seems like my balance is a bit worse, though that might just be the effect of aging. It is also incredibly difficult and distressing to miss a dose: headaches, dizziness, and extreme mood swings.

Despite all of this, I am incredibly grateful for this drug. I didn't believe that a psych drug could ever change my life like this. It takes awhile to begin its effects but I would give it a chance if you have mood swing issues-- just take it consistently, at the same time each day."

I had a TIA (mini-stroke) 6.5 years ago at the age of 29.  This mild brain injury changed my way of thinking.  I became extremely frustrated and easily irritable, which led to anger and depression.

After only 6 weeks, I'm a completely different person!  The irritability and frustrations are gone and I'm now able to put daily annoyances out of mind almost instantly.  I find myself going to the gym because I want to, not because I'm so frustrated that I need an outlet.  Now, my mind is consumed with positive thoughts and flashbacks of my past no longer weigh me down.  Also, I no longer anticipate and expect bad things to happen.  When I wake up, I just know it's going to be another good day.

Just 2 months ago, I was miserable and had no idea why God chose to put me on this Earth.  Now, I've strung 6 great weeks together and am excited for what my future holds.

Since it is listed as one of the ""very rare"" side effects, I feel obligated as a woman to share my experience for other women to keep an eye out for in case they develop this.  Female genital disorder has only recently been added as a side effect.  I am the person who never gets the common side effects so I searched for hours before I found only 2 other people with the same report.

If I forget to take it at night, I have a very hard time waking up and I feel awful. If I go to work after skipping a dose, I have to have someone bring it to me, so that I won't get disoriented and anxious. I don't like that aspect of this drug at all.

""oh, it'll work pretty soon, just wait until you get a higher dosage."" funny story, i'm at 200mg and it does absolutely nothing. it's inhibited a lot of my creativity and taken out a big chunk of my mental capacity, but it really hasn't done anything. i still have suicidal ideation, and the only thing stopping me is not wanting to hurt my family. however, if depressed enough, that does not matter because my body automatically tries to end it's suffering, so it's really very important that i have something blocking all levels of depression. all it does is stop me from being manic, which, personally, i'd rather be manic all the time than depressed. now i have to stop cold turkey because my psych canceled my appointment, and i've been off one day and have started hearing voices and feeling presences at night and having panic attacks. i don't know, this might mean i'm schizoaffective but whatever. this drug was a pain to get on (constant nausea, pounding headaches, and at times severe crippling depression) and at this point my body has developed a very strong aversion to taking it. im going to a new psych next week to get evaluated. this drug sucks."

You have to take into consideration the fact that this medication reacts differently when there are multiple medications in your system. My doctor suggested Lamictal to me first for bipolar 2 disorder. I refused to take it because I had heard about the rash / stephen johnson syndrome, it had always been a fear so I absolutely refused to try it. I tried Abilify first, It seemed to change my life for the best until I started becoming exhausted and could barely walk down the street without having to rest. Could barely drive without having to take a nap on the side of the road. Turned out to be a side effect and I was taken off. I tried lithium as it was ""affordable"" and typical, it did nothing good for me, I was having awful mixed states, sudden crying spells, overly sensitive, and could not sit still for a minute, nothing improved so he took me off of it. Even with just two trials I told the doctor ""fine, i'll try lamictal"" well, about a year later it's changed my life for the good. I hate relying on medication but in all honesty the way this has helped me is well worth some sort of reliance. This was mostly to treat my depression, I don't get depressed as much anymore. I do have a phase here and there but it is much less severe than it used to be, i'll feel down but not so suicidal and completely worthless anymore. I will say though that the past two weeks have been interesting, I cannot tell what state I am in, I have once again become overly sensitive and easily irritable, the physical pain i've been in lately has been so confusing and awful (numb hands, tingling, crying, headaches, feeling light headed) very strange signs. Could easily be from something else but it's almost as if the meds just quit working out of the blue. However although i'm dealing with this, the depression is still nothing compared to what it used to be. "

However because of a birth control pill I take for hormone regulation, the efficacy of Lamotrigine is reduced, totally opposite of other medications.  I just had another generalized seizure 4 days ago. I spent 8 hours the ER with tachy arrythmias and intermittant seizures.  I previously told my neurologist about the medication interaction in mid August and he never increased my lamotrigene which is supposed to be increased 2 fold.  Especially because the NP who prescribed the hormone medicine made a point of telling me to follow up with my neurologist, now I can't drive for 6 months(HA! HA!)and that neurologist just displayed his incompetence to me.  He can pay for my medical bills now. I already refuse to see one of his colleagues because the other doc refused to change me from tegretol years ago and the end result landed me in the ER at the hospital I worked at and had my privacy violated I was discriminated against by my supervisor after she accessed my medical records and reported me to employee health.  I have a long list of other ailments, my seizures are usually the least of my worries.  Since that incident, I have had a hard time with employers.  I can't stand the response I get from them when they hear about my seizures amongst other things.

128$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/12/2012 8:38:57 AM$Reviewer: deadladytalking, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$After trying several antidepressants and lithium, the doctor prescribed lamotrigine/lamictal and wellbutrin/bupropion which has helped alot. lithium didn't help at all and caused rapid weight gain once i reached 1000mg (theraptutic level)and thyroid problems and was still depressed even depite trying celexa, citopram, and wellbutrin combined with the lithium. discouraged, i went in and asked to be taken off my drugs and she said to try this before making such a hasty decision and it worked! lamictal took away my anger/aggression and depression slightly so she prescribed wellbutrin to help with the depression and it was a life changer! it takes a while to reach a theraputic level (over a month) but with each week, i felt better. what people have to remember is that each drug effects different neurotransmitters in your brain and each person is different. plus, people are more likely to review when they're disatisfied, rather than happy so that also screws witht he rating. I say try it and see if it helps! I take mine before i want to go to sleep and you do get drowsy but when i wake up that doesn't effect me as much. wellbutrin is also a stimulant so that may be another factor. start with a low dose (25mg) and increase weekly by 25 mg to lessen the chance of getting the rash which is rare. before this drug, i wanted to kill myself and was very angry and depressed despite being on lithium which most bipolar people find effective; just not me. each person is different. be willing to try different drugs or combinations and be patient because there is a theraptuic level you have to reach.

It wasn't until last yr that I KNEW that I couldn't continue on being ""moody"" and I sought help. I was resistant to the idea of meds. Once I gave in I went to my GP & tried anti-depressants, they made me distant and angry. I gave them a moment to see if I'd adjust, I didn't and I left them alone. I moved to Lamictal/Lamotrigine as per my Pdoc. As I moved up in dosage I began to notice that I no longer had issues w/getting out of bed or feeling suicidal. I no longer felt the need or want to drink, I could sit in bars w/my buddies and be happy w/out having a round or two or five! I no longer looked for sex everywhere I could find it. No more spending cash on god-knows-what for NO REASON at all.

Within an hour after I take it I have to shut my eyes and put my head down. But I can't take it at night because whenever I do, I don't sleep, despite being very tired. It's odd. 

I initally got prescribed this as a mood stabalizer. I get hypo-manic, and was never willing to get on a mood stabalizer untill I realized the older I get, the worse my depressions get. So my prescriber told me that lamictal would keep my depressions from getting SOO low, and keep my mania from getting TOO high. 

I don't really know if it's working, because I still get pretty depressed for long periods of time. Many just not as bad as it use to be, but not really noticeable either. I find myself unable to take this medication, unless I have a few hours in my day free where I know I don't have to exert myself or keep my eyes open. Waste of frickin time. "

215$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/7/2011 9:28:57 PM$Reviewer: Better in FL, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been taking the generic form of lamotrigine for 5+ years. Unlike some others, it has worked well in controlling my symptoms. I feel balanced. I experienced multiple major depressive events starting in my 30's which I treated by indulging in alcohol. Eventually I tried every SSRI on the market, Wellbutrin, Trazadone and several others. These made me manic and caused severe insomina. After taking lamotrigine for a couple or years, I began having panic attacks. My doctor added Xanax. It was the perfect combination and the most effective treatment to date. One thing is important - don't use drugs or alcohol if you expect to get the full benefits of this product. I haven't had a drink for 3+ years and this was the key to achieving maximum effectiveness. Substance abuse is a problem with many of us with bipolar depression. If that is a factor, you have to deal with that as part of the treatment plan. Not always easy to do, but worth it. I was teetering between a good life and losing it all. I didn't lose my life. Identifying the right combination of drugs and a good psychiatrist is key to finding the right thing for you. I take 300 mg per day - 150 mg morning and night with 50 mg Xanax at the same time. No side effects.

I was recently prescribed Geodon to help with this, only I don't notice much of a difference--if any.  I have learned that this is just the kind of thing I really need to communicate with my doctor on.  Until you find something that actually works sometimes you feel bad because you are taking a medication and you can't really tell if it is doing anything.  That was not the case with Lamictal for me.  I am afraid I will have to take it my whole life and it is really expensive.  I don't want to go off it since it helps, only depending upon my insurance coverage I may not be able to afford staying on it.

I have been disabled due to multiple health problems for 1 year, but hope to recover enough to return to work. I have never felt depressed or manic, but in the last year I have been having uncharacteristic outbursts of anger/rage which worsened when my Rheumatologist put me on Cymbalta for the fibromyalgia & neuropathy. There was no physical violence...just verbally abuse. I do not want to damage my relationship with my wife, and two precious little girls (ages 4 & 6) by being verbally abusive to them. I just started taking Lamotrigine 10 days ago. I go up to 50 mg on day 14. Since I began, my daily muscle and joint pain has worsened considerably. Is anyone else out there taking Lamotrigine for fits of anger? Has it helped? Does anyone out there on this drug also have RA, gout or fibromyalgia? If so, how does Lamotrigine make you feel?

As with most mood stablilizers, it takes several wks to feel full effects (so give it a chance to act full-swing before getting off it).  Generics for this drug recently came out (in about the last yr or so).  The first generic I took, which was diamond-shaped and same color as original, worked exactly the same  However Mylan also makes a generic of the same (my pharmacy just switched to to it), but it is not quick-dissolving.  You should be able to drop a pill in warm water and see most of it disolve in about 90 seconds.   This may not be a problem for some, but it has been for me.  I hope someone finds this helpful.

(I have been on Adderall XR for 3 months now to treat adult ADD.) He said it would help with mood swings.  Since my insurance does not cover it, I was given the generic of Lamotrigine to take at night (while Adderall is taken in AM).  After only ONE pill I can tell you that I will never take it again.  I have a raging migraine and I feel like my limbs could be severed and I would not even notice.  Living in a fog is not my idea of a good life.  There seems to be a real difference in the reviews of Lamictal v. Lamotrigine with the brand name given better ratings.  I realize I should probably have given this drug at least a month to work before submitting a review, but I couldn't wait that long.  No more Lamotrigine for me.

Took about 4 weeks before it became effective. First time I have been able to tolerate the neuropathic pain in 7 years. Because the pain is minimized, I am now able to get some sleep at night. If I wake up with any pain I use a TENs machine and am able to sleep again. I take 75 mg in the AM in divided dose b/c the pill causes insominia if taken at night. Some weight loss with the med b/c the med modifies hunger pains. Take tylenol if I get a headache with the med. Initially had blood pressure spike but B/P ok now. Have more energy. Hope this med keep working for me.

I've even been reducing the trazodone and can still sleep, but still cannot take Lamictal on an empty stomach anytime.

I started this medicine 4 years ago and have suffered insomnia ever since. I was prescribed to take it at night. 3 years ago the insomnia became worse- lasting up to 4-5 days at a time.  I NEVER SHUT DOWN - not even the following day.  I tried everything on the market: behavioral modification (dark room, etc), all the drugs listed on this website for insomnia. Finally, after forgetting to take it for a couple of nights, I was able to sleep normally.  I tried, as a last resort, to take it in the morning only - AND TO MY RELIEF AND ELATION MY INSOMNIA WAS CURED! I take the medicine first thing in the morning now and it gives me a the same buzz as taking vitamin B.  I am tired at night like I am supposed to be and sleep like a baby.  I actually dream now whereas before I laid awake all night listening to every sound.  Apparantly, because this side effect is so rare - no doctor I saw could identify the cause of my insomnia.  I write this for those of you out who suffered like me with insomnia for years with no relief.

Took about 6 months for depression to catch me again.Then they put me on Wellbutrin which was horrible because I was a zombie. Now they have me on lamotrogine to ""get me back on track"". As others have mentioned here, I have that dizzy, headache and overall tired feeling thats now effecting my job.

It became acute in the beginning of February -- extremem vertigo (falling, vomiting) and horrible headaches.  I have missed so much work that I am now on STD until it gets under control.  After multiple (expensive) tests I am now seeing a (??? balance PT) to retrain my brain.  It didn't even occur to me (or any of the doctors) that this drug may be the cause until I went for my pre-scheduled follow-up appointment with my psychiatrist who subscribed the drug.  the Dr. is now titrating me off the drug within the next 10 days.

But when I started taking the birth control Yaz, I was back at square one. Chased my husband with a knife, cried for everything, throwing tantrums like a 4 year old without any regard to where I was or who saw. Walked through the mountains with wild animals around & didn't care. Also took Celexa but that gave me nausea, & slept for 10 to 14 hrs a day. I'm up to 275 mg. going to 300 mg soon, only because I throw fits & get violent during my period. Don't think it would hurt to try.

I started breaking out in a rash about two days into it.  The rash isn't too bad and it appears to be limited in location but it itches really bad and is a nuisance.  I am also taking prozac, klonopin and trazadone (all generic brands) for depression.  I don't know if I should continue this drug or not.  My Dr. has me increasing my dose by 25mg each week.  Right now I am only taking 25mg in the A.M. but will be increasing to 25 mg BID.

It worked very well. It was a very expensive drug.  When I switched to generic-the effectivness went down hill really quick.  I wish I could afford the name brand.  It WAS working really well for me.  I would give the name brand a very high rating, and the generic a ""0""."

That in its self is all the reason I needed to know that this medicine is the one for me! I didn't know anything about this med. until I seen a new Dr. this past yr.. He told me that he was surprized that I was still alive and had not commited suicide. I told him it was my kids, they're the reason I'm still here. I am at a dosage of 400mg a night I am currently learning techniques to help me some day be med free.  I will continue to use this life altering med until I am able to reach that achievement.

The past 7 years have taken every SSRI under the sun. After about 5-8 months they all lost effectiveness. Newer drugs like Cymbalta made me feel ill. It's been 10 months, this has been so much better. My husband actually said it's the best so far.
SSRI's made me so very tired-lethargic:this is the opposite. Plus I can split the pills in half and take 1/2 in th a.m. and the other after lunch. "

Most seem to help in the beginning then eventually taper off, causing my doctor to ""switch"" meds. I have been on lamictal about 6 months now, in combination with effexor, klonopin and trazodone. I felt a drastic improvement with the lamictal @ about 8 weeks time. Continued to be extremely satisfied with the med untill the generic form was released. I still take the medication but it makes me nauseated, have noticed a decline in effectiveness. My doctor is happy to require brand name but I do not want the HASSLE OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY! Brand name lamictal, I reccommened 100% for anyone suffering from bi-polar depression. Generic ...I hope you have a hardy stomach!!!"

I had been taking brand name Lamictal since 2005. I was switched to generic Lamotrigine in August 2008. In late September, my left breast became very sensitive.

351$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/2/2008 1:48:20 PM$Reviewer: believer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken this medication for over 2 years. It has been a God-send. I have been bi-polar for over 30 years and this is the best medication ever. I used to take lithium which required blood tests once a month due to the fine line between toxic and theraputic levels. So, sometimes, I would go off of it because it was such a hassle. But with lamictal, I don't have to worry about that. I have not experienced any side effects. I am also taking effexor to control the depression. The combination of both of these meds has been a real blessing. I have never felt better. I would encourage any one who has been diagnosed with manic-depression or bipolar illness to talk to their doctor about lamictal.

I began taking Lamictal after being diagnosed for agitated depression. I started on the sample kit prescribed to me from my psychiatrist. 13 days into beginning the starter kit my Lymph nodes began to swell. I got a red itchy rash all over my body. I didnt begin to think this was a serious problem until my fever reached 105 degress F. I was taken into ER and the red rash was all over my body. The pain in my lymph nodes was so bad that i was precribed darvocet for the pain. The symptoms died down after a week. The ER stated I had a strepp infection and was given an amoxocilin antibiotic. After completing the antibiotic I was told by my Psych to begin taking the Lamictal at day 14 were I left off. I took the Lamictal at 830 in the morning by 10 am I was taken to the ER for an alergic reaction. I am partial to all medications for I can help people however, This particular medication almost landed me in my death bed...
Good luck"

I was lucky not to develop the rash and increasing the dose slowly to 300mg has been easy with only thirst and a relaxing drowsiness as side-effects. Overall combined with seroquel I am living a life free of mood swings, depressive episodes and extreme high moods. A great drug in my opinion.
