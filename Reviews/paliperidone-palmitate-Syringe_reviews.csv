He is almost unable to eat unassisted at times.  This was piled onto my bipolar spouse's regimen while also on lithium,  Depakote and diabetes meds.  He was successfully coming down from a Manic episode when this was added (unnecessarily, I believe).  I WOULD NOT GIVE THIS MED TO A RABID DOG, MUCH LESS A HUMAN BEING.  We also believe he experienced extreme,  rapid muscle loss after taking this poison.  

Sorry.  It may help some people but NOT us,  and I would not recommend it for bipolar psychosis. "

2$Condition: Other$3/16/2013 6:00:01 PM$Reviewer: Loria, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  My Dr. prescribed Invega 3 mg pills along with an anti-depressant to assist with pain management.  I was extremely skeptical when I read what Invega was designed to treat, but at the time I was in so much pain I was desperate to try anything. Strangely enough it has helped!   I'm not 100%, but I am able to work.
