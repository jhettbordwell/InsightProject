He is almost unable to eat unassisted at times.  This was piled onto my bipolar spouse's regimen while also on lithium,  Depakote and diabetes meds.  He was successfully coming down from a Manic episode when this was added (unnecessarily, I believe).  I WOULD NOT GIVE THIS MED TO A RABID DOG, MUCH LESS A HUMAN BEING.  We also believe he experienced extreme,  rapid muscle loss after taking this poison.  

Sorry.  It may help some people but NOT us,  and I would not recommend it for bipolar psychosis. "

2$Condition: Other$3/16/2013 6:00:01 PM$Reviewer: Loria, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  My Dr. prescribed Invega 3 mg pills along with an anti-depressant to assist with pain management.  I was extremely skeptical when I read what Invega was designed to treat, but at the time I was in so much pain I was desperate to try anything. Strangely enough it has helped!   I'm not 100%, but I am able to work.
3$Condition: Schizophrenia$1/19/2012 12:35:35 PM$Reviewer: Me83oN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$3$I went through a period of sycosis from end of January 2011 - March or April 2011. Started getting the shot in March I think and in a month or 2 the sycosis subsided. Been on it now for almost a year and haven't heard any voices that aren't really there or seen anything that isn't really there. This was probally my 5th time having sycosis. This time I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I haven't really noticed any side effects. Except for I had lost some wieght then gained 20 lbs back and I am making alot of the hormone that you have when you are pregnant but am not pregnant. That causes me to produce milk. When I first started getting the shot I was scared. Getting the shot in the arm hurts for a few days afterward. The hip doesn't really hurt at all.
