0$Condition: Angina Pectoris Prevention$1/1/2018 3:55:59 PM$Reviewer: Belen, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been using the patches for over a year and they have worked very well with only a couple of times needing nitro pills when not applied.  But don't stick well to fatty areas so I put on upper back as they won't stick on breasts to stay.  Quite satisfied as to effectiveness!

It is like they use super glue on it :) and it gives me a headache everyday (expected)
