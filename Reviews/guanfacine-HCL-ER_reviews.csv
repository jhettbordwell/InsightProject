0$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$9/1/2019 6:23:08 AM$Reviewer: Mike , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$2$"I’m 39 years old and have been taking this medicine (3mg) for almost a week. I have ADD which was pretty noticeable by me and my family. I went to the doctor and tried 2 different medicines but the side effects was high blood pressure and constipation so they didn’t workout. The first few day on this medicine I was so tired. When I got up in the morning I could barely stand up and walk without stumbling but it has gotten better. I noticed now when I get up I’m dizzy and it feels like it feels when you stand up to fast and the blood rush to your head. Also I noticed that my legs get numb and my arm get numb and fingers tingling. I’m assuming its affecting my blood circulation. 
My final take on what I like about this medicine:
It works for me as far as treating my symptoms and I can notice a huge difference in being able to focus and. Also my blood pressure was slightly elevated before this medicine but is now in normal range.

What I don’t like:
The side effects is bothering me with the dizziness, tingling, and numbness in my limbs. If this doesn’t get better soon I might have to stop taking."

It did not help with her ADHD at all and she started falling asleep in the afternoons at school. She wouldn't want to do her classwork and lost any interest in school.

I was sleepy all the time and mentally exhausted.  I didn't want to go back on a stimulant because they make me very moody and irritable.  I have been on this for about 2 months. Started with 1 mg, good for the week and surprised I wasn't more sleepy after reading all the reviews. Noticed a slight difference in tiredness and mental focus. Increased to 2 mg and doing great. Not tired, not exhausted, sleeping well. I do get tired and mental drained in the afternoons and I'm discussing 3 mg worth my dr. Waiting 1 more week before we do that. Overall I'm completely happy with this and so glad I didn't go back to a stimulant.  I am also on stetrilene.

He started taking about 5mg of Vyvanse but the side effects have been terrible.  He would hardly eat anything, sleep deprived, angry, argumentative, and just plain hard to deal with after the medicine wore off for about a solid 2-3 hours.  We are now in the fourth grade and tried to up his dosage to 20 mg but could not get past 15mg.  The side effects became worse.  He even started a sniffing tic that was so annoying.  He was getting into trouble for silly little things like playing in the bathroom at school, talking out of turn etc.  Thankfully he did not get into fights or such.  He is a sweet, loving child.  He does pout if he does not get his way though.  With all that said, we went back to the doctor and he put him on 5mg of adderall.  Same side effects.  We took him off and the with drawl was horrendous!!!! So we started with Guanfacine- Tenex on November 2nd and he is so much better as far as calm, kind, not argumentative, not mean, not smart acting.  He will not reach full effects until at least 8-9 weeks.  Being tired should subside!  My only hope now is that he has more drive and willingness to do homework and things that are required of him after he gets through the tired stage.  So much better than the stimulants.
9$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/8/2016 1:09:33 AM$Reviewer: anonimous, 13-18 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $2$3$2$As the primary caregiver of my grandson who was diagnosed with having ADHD five years ago at the age of eight. Taking the long acting guafacine HCL WAS helpful with him getting a reasonable amount of sleep with out getting up perioticly through out the night. It was unfortunately causing him to be tired and sleepy through out the day and hard to maintain in class at school not feeling like doing much of anything. It didn't seem to help his ADHD, Other than slowing him down. He became over time aggressive with his behavior as if he was regressing reverting back to the behaviors he was depicting in the beginning before he was diagnosed and put on medication. When he decided to not take it anymore, after about two weeks of not taking the guanfacine he complained of feeling sick with nausea. The nausea appeared to have only lasted for one day. His Dr. was informed of his discontinuance. Since then he appear to not be as tired and is some what more willing to doing his homework and is not showing the aggression but showing more calmness.

My doctor advised me to take this medication at bedtime, because it is a extended release medication. I have noticed I wake up in the middle of the night sweating. Also, I get tired by the middle of the day for a couple of hours then have a burst of energy. The medicine does make me more calm, manages my anxiety and reduces my restlessness, however, the drowsiness is very annoying.

I have been taking it for 3 weeks, the first 3 days in the morning...then I stopped because I was SO tired. Then I started taking again at night 3 weeks ago, and I get tired a few times throughout day at work and then really tired at night. I just want to come home and sleep....only to wake up between 12:30-2am. For my myself, the benefits of this drug helping me focus don't outweigh the side effects. I feel like it's more of an anti hyper drug by making you VERY tired. I plan on not taking it anymore....I've created habits at work to help me focus like daily checklists and writing everything down.

Worked with an outpatient crisis center for children as she was becoming violent.  After 5 weeks they prescribed this medication and this time I opted to use.  She also was told 1/2 pill in morning and 1/2 at night.  Very lethargic and complained constantly of that.  After 2 weeks started to see dramatic reduction in behaviors.  After 4 months of being on it, the Grand Mall tantrums are GONE!!  She still is hot headed but has a window to think and her reaction is so much better.  Grades improved and I highly recommend.  

Con - there is NOT enough studies on the affects this has on children.  They really don't even know how it works, let alone the long term affects.  I will keep her on it for 1 year and take her off slowly and see if it was a behavior.   "

My 17 yo patient w/ ADHD also had depressive and anger problems.  We had struggled with multiple different medications for ADD and as well as antidepressants and some antipsycyhotics. I decided to try him on Intuniv.  1mg made him so sleepy that I told the family to stop it.  The mother, however, chose to cut the dose in half (1/2 mg).  The results have been astounding.  Not only has the ADHD been dramatically improved, but the depression and anger have disappeared.  He even gets along with his 16yo sister.

It is in combination with Concerta.  This was used to replace Strattera, as the side affects from that went from none to us ready to commit him!  He takes 1mg in morning with Concerta and 1/2 about 3pm.  As tachycardia was becoming an issue, it no longer is plus it works so much better!  He does have other issues (connectivity with front and back of brain, takes resperidol for that), trying to find something to work was not easy.  He is in 6th grade, maintains a 2.9 or higher gpa, and has finally made a few friends!  He still has some difficulty with peers and attention, but nothing like it was!  This is one of the best meds they have tried with him.  He continues this dose with his others.  Still a handful first thing in morning before meds and close to bedtime, but at least it isn't all day!  Very happy with this one!

At first he was sleepy a lot. Then as time passed by we could tell the difference when he missed a dose. It helps, but I am still concerned about my child interaction with other children. He is a lovable sweet person, but sometimes other children sees him as being over bearing and irritating. My child does not like being alone. He is a sociable person. I don't know if I need to look for other medicines that can assist with this behavior. Adults love him, because he is so loving in caring, but other children as well as his siblings don't share the sentiment. Has anyone experienced this with their kids? What options were you given or did you take to help your child? Thanks in advance!

She has been taking it for 3 months.  She started off with 1 pill a day and after a month put on 2 pills a day.  Just this month put on 3 pills a day.  (which is what the doctor initially discussed)  I feel that this medication is working but I am closely watching the side effects.  She has gained 10 lbs in 2 months but that could also be the age she is.  She is also more moody and seems to be more sensitive too.  Again this could be her age as the hormones are playing a part in this.  Another side effect I have noticed is that she is restless more at night and tends to sleep walk once or twice during the night.  Overall I am happy with this drug and it seems to be working to help her stop the urge to pull.  I must also say that we have tried all kinds of techniques with nothing working but this medication.

We switched after being unhappy with the side effects of focalin & methyl phenidate, which both helped her focus in school but took away her wonderful personality.  She is now able to focus, is less hyper, and has finally got her appetite back after 2 years of being on the other stimulants.  We are happy to see that she is gaining weight.  She is also a happier child on this medication.  The only issues we've had was that if we gave too much, her system had trouble metabolizing and it would ""build up"" and she'd have insomnia at night.  We currently give her 1/2 a pill (0.5 mg) which seems to be right for her.  I would definitely recommend this medication for others who have concerns about their child's personality being ""flat"" on the stimulant meds.  It certainly is worth a try.  Be aware that in the start-up phase, your child will be sleepy, but this goes away after they get used to it (within a few days of each dose increase).  Good luck!"

My son, who is ten now, has been on guanfacine for quite some time (2 yrs) after running the gamit of medicines...  Stimulants would work adequately, but suppress his personality, and he had zero friends... none whatsoever... it was heartbreaking to watch...  A low dose strattera and the guanfacine has worked miracles... The long half life of the tenex makes this ideal, and no medicine during school!   The tiredness will decrease with continued use, and the full effects are realized several weeks after use.

55$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/10/2009 9:39:59 AM$Reviewer: juseaus, 3-6 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years$5$4$5$My son has been taking this medicine for about a year now for his ADHD. He is almost 6 now. The doctors couldn't give him a stimulant because he also has a mild form of Tourette's and a stimulant would bring out his ticks. So now after a year of use, I have noticed a HUGE change in my son. He is more calm and reasonable regarding situations which he use to not have any patience for. And it's not to a point where he is like a zombie which was my biggest fear when staring him on medication. If I give him his medicine 2 or 3 hours late, I notice a huge difference. His hyperactivity and ticks flare up and he has trouble focusing. As a parent formerly against medicating children for ADD & ADHD, I am glad I did this because my son is so smart and has been doing excellent at school now that he can focus better.

I had ADHD really bad and now I don't. The only bad thing is that I feel like it loses it's effectivenes over time. I had my dose increased and that helped, but I still wish it could do more for me than it does.

She was only on 1mg when I took her off of it b/c of some side effects she was having...she was experiencing leg cramps that tylenol wouldn't help and having weird fits and I would have to cradle her and rock her to calm here down! She will start Focalin this week so we will see if that helps...this medication did help with the attention problem, but I wasn't willing to put up with the extreme side effects!

She too was very sleepy and groggy during school but soon she became used to the medication. Her tics almost vanished! Her ADHD calmed way down during the day so she could study during school. I give this medication a shiny star and A+. Over the summer my daughter wanted to ween her self off her meds. We tried. Her tics came back. Her ADHD was back with a vengeance so she decided she wanted her medication; the tension in her body was too much for her to handle. This medication is great for Tourettes!!

When first starting this medication it made him slow and sleepy for the first couple days. Then after about a month his aggressive behaviors and outburst started back up. We increased the dosage and he did the slow and sleepy for a couple days and after a week his behaviors came back. Im now weining him off to try a new medicine, risperdal. We have tried clonodine and mythelin- which did not work for us either.
