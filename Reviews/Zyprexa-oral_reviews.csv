Rexulti worked great for my depression but is over $1000 a month, so my doctor prescribed zyprexa. Almost immediately after taking my first dose, I got super drowsy and fell asleep. The entire next day I felt like a zombie, I couldn't concentrate, and I wanted to just sleep all day. I had to leave work early just to go back to sleep, I was that out of it. The second time I took the dose, same thing happened. I'd rather be depressed than feel like I did on zyprexa"

I also have body dysmorphic disorder. I am 23 years old taking prozac and Buspar. These medicines have helped me. But This medication has changed my life. It is awesome! I wish I have had it all of my life. I usually have racing thoughts/voices in my head every day. They are negative voices that tell me ""you're ugly, you're fat,  you're unattractive, nobody wants you, you should disappear, etc."" But this medicine helps more than anything to quiet those negative voices.But if you suffer every day,lIke I do I think this medicine might be good. I used to spend every hour suffering, fighting my thoughts. I couldn't even go into a store. But now don't care as much when I go places. I noticed I am more calm and positive. This medicine makes me want to be more productive and happy. I am on my 2nd-3rd week of taking it. I don't have any side effects so far. This has changed my life and I am so thankful for it. This gives me hope"

(who was office staff for the APRN) about him.  Very irresponsible.  My son gained over 60 pounds in a few months, his bp sky rocked, and he became diabetic  - just before he died of a fatal arrhythmia- supposedly due to sleep apnea.  This drug made my son unresponsive, lethargic, exacerbated his sleep apnea with weight gain and I believe eventually killed him.  Before my son passed I spoke to the APRN about taking him off of this drug, she just kept saying ""he has to be compliant"".  Where was her compliance with medical ethics? - she had never seen my son as a patient.  Now I read that there is a high probability that this drug causes arrhythmias.    "

14$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$5/23/2014 5:03:57 PM$Reviewer: DWL, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$1$Its been over ten years since I finally got off Zyprexa It was at one of the worst times in my life, with a number of psychological symptoms, including a lack of creativity, muted sense of being able to think in general; I couldn't even think of things to talk about to anyone, especially strangers.  My psychiatrist tried stopping this medication, but when this happened I had a certain mental reaction, with confusion in a part of my brain.  Finally I was able to get off Zyprexa, dropping it for Abilify, which at that time was being prescribed in large dosages, which was miserable (I've used Ability in the past few years, on a much lower dosage, which helped for awhile, but then wasn't effective), eventually I got off that by taking myself off against medical advice.  But the thing I noticed was that once I was off Zyprexa, my creativity improved dramatically and my life became so much more settled and happy.  Over the years I've talked to several medical people (including a psychiatrist), who said that my premise that Zyprexa caused me brain damage was possible.  I was just going through the extra stress of having dysthymia, a lower grade depression that lasts for years, back in 1997, but eventually my mental condition deteriated to the point that I had a major breakdown psychologically that caused me to eventually lose my job, and ended with about six years of terrible stress.  Maybe this was just a wrong drug for my mental illness, I don't know, but life has been tough over the years still, but with a brighter outlook.  A number of antidepressants and an antipsychotic definitely helped me stablize, along with counseling.

My idiot doctor said that I would NOT gain weight which is ridiculous because this drug is known for its weight gain side effect. I gained 12 lbs in less than 2 weeks. You become ravaged and eat your way through the kitchen. I would think about Big Macs 11 pm night in bed. Also I had the rare side effect of peripheral edema. My left leg swelled up within days. I had to go the ER to rule ou a blood clot. A sonogram showed no blood clot thank God, but it was peripheral edema as a rare side effect.

As a petite woman (I'm only 4'10) this has been devastating! The medication definitely helped with my anxiety, but it caused me to be in a constant 'blank' state,  little to no emotions or feelings. I felt tired all the time and felt as though I needed to sleep constantly. I stopped taking the medication on my own, against my doctor's recommendation. Coming off the med was difficult, in the first week after discontinuing I felt more emotionally unstable than I ever have in my life, much more so than before I began the medication. It's been over a month since I quit taking it, and even though I'm working out 4 days a week and eating an extremely low calorie & low carb diet the weight is not coming off! I'm beginning to worry that this medicine has somehow caused me permanent obesity! I will say that this may be an effective medicine for someone in an extreme crises situation, or in such a severe manic state that they're willing to gain weight and possibly destroy their body in exchange for stabilizing their mood, as it does ""work"" in the sense that it prevents one from feeling just about anything!

The first dose obliterated obsessions, racing thoughts, and severe insomnia.  The day after was completely different from the day before.  OTOH I had the problems others had mentioned -- sluggishness and food cravings leading to weight gain.  The weight problems are a Catch-22 with me because I gain weight when I am depressed, and while I'm not depressed with Zyprexa, it leads to weight gain.  But I have been able to lose weight while on Zyprexa, and it's only on Zyprexa that I seem to have the will to do it.  That will continue to be a battle.  I've been off it and on it, and would love to find something that works as well without the side effects, but so far no luck.

I also experience a very weak tired feeling which only added to the weight gain. If you can deal with the weight, it is a great medication.

I was given this drug to treat what my PC diagnosed as depression.  Without even realizing it I had slowly but steadily been sliding deeper into depression. I began going to bed very early and sleeping until 11 am, stopped dressing and keeping up with my daily grooming. My family and I were suffering. I began using Zyprexa recently and those close to me that don't even know that I began a new medication have commented how much more ""alive"" I seem. I am in a better mood, laughing more, joking around, sleeping less and dressing up more. Up til now I have not experienced any hyperactivity, no weight gain, and no sedation. Knock on wood. I would recommend this to anyone who has tried other meds with little result. You may just be as surprised as I was."

66$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/13/2009 6:36:00 AM$Reviewer: Jerseyrose2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$3$2$"Let me just say this. If you are experiencing a major trauma in your life or a major manic episode that you just can't seem to deal with on your own, this is your medication! It works wonders! I've tried quite a number of meds for their tranquil effectiveness and none work like this one.

BE WARNED, HOWEVER! YOUR WEIGHT GAIN WILL BE MASSIVE!!! The feeling is great, but the cravings are uncontrollable! I gained about 10 lbs.in 3 weeks. I recommend it only be used short term. And when I say short term, I mean only stay on it long enough to get over whatever it is you are currently experiencing. As soon as you feel better, you should ask your doctor about switching to another drug.

Zyprexa has redeeming qualities due to its tranquilizing and dulling effect. You will be so ""zoned out"" (for lack of better words), you won't care about anything. This can work for you or against you; depending on how you look at it. This feeling of euphoria also validates my point about this medication being effective if you are going through a severe traumatic situation and you're prone to having manic episodes.

All in all, I would recommend Zyprexa for short term use only. Discuss other options with your PDOC as you will gain 5 pounds just filling the prescription for this one!"

The mood improved very rapidly but the weight gain also kicked in very rapidly also.  I gained fifty pounds in one month with eating healthy and exercising.  The problem was eating all the time.  The sick gut feeling of hunger was too much and I had to come off the medication.  My daughter is now on the medication and we are watching the same response and are demanding the change but needed the immediate mood change to save her life.  The drug is excellent for an immediate response or bridge drug but not a long term treatment medication.

It immediately calmed me down, helped me get my anxiety under control, and I finally could sleep for more than four hours.

The reason for the high dissatisfaction is first, I was sleepy ALL THE TIME.  I went from four hours sleep to 12 or more hours sleep, and even after all that I was still sleepy.

I had a long commute to work, and there were several incidents where I almost crashed into the interstate divider.

In addition to the sleepiness, I became a food hog.  I ate, ate, ate and ate, and after all that still ate.  I ballooned from 190 lbs to 250 lbs in less than a year.

It is a good drug for bi-polar, and if it were a choice between bi-polar and a better life, and if Zyprexa was all that there was, I would go with it.  Plus, these issue may not be typical for everyone.

I no longer take the drug, and I have not for several years.  I take Lamictal now, and I am back down to 190 lbs.

I hope this review helps."
76$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$5/26/2009 6:16:32 PM$Reviewer: AkathisiaFreak, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$2$5$"My experience with Zyprexa (olanzapine) is probably not representative of most patients who take the drug.  I have learned (the hard way) that I am very sensitive to anti-dopamine drugs such as Zyprexa, so what I say here won't apply to everybody.

In any event, I got the drug to combat major depression as well as frequent mood swings that felt like the hypomania of Bipolar-II disorder.

Unfortunately, my treatment ended up a disaster (your experience will vary).  I had hypoglycemia occasionally as a kid, and this medication (taken when I was 21) brought it back.

The worst side effect, though, was ""akathisia"" (an incredibly horrific sense of anxiety; time seems to slow to a stop and you can't stop yourself from pacing around the place).  Akathisia isn't too common with this drug (as compared to even other newer antipsychotics, such as Abilify/aripiprazole), but it hit me hard with Zyprexa personally.

Overall, I would not recommend this drug to anybody who has had a bad reaction to other sedating antipsychotics (such as Seroquel/quetiapine), whether the negative reaction was blood sugar issues or akathisia.

However, Zyprexa's mild sedation (not as bad as Seroquel's or that of the older antipsychotics) will help a lot of people who are willing to put up with the blood sugar issues. 

But for me? It was a total disaster.

I gained 50 pounds in 5 and a half years before I was finally taken off of it. I've been completely off of it for less than 2 weeks, and I've already lost at least 10 pounds. I didn't mind sleeping all the time. I kinda liked it, but I knew that 12 to 18 hours a night wasn't normal. Zyprexa kinda deadened my emotions, but I didn't mind. The numbness was better than the pain. It really did help me, but I couldn't keep gaining weight. I am 5 foot 3 inches and weighed 160 pounds, compared to 110 or less when I started. It really put stress on my body.

I go through episodes where I get non-stop anxiety so bad that I can't sleep at all, one big adrenaline rush.  This is the only medication I've used that's helped.  I've been struggling for 13 years with this and after a half hour of taking the first dose I was able to lay back on the couch and just breath and relax.  When I'd fall asleep is was really deep (which, made me groggy in the morning it was so deep... but that was far better than the alternative).  I've read a lot of bad reviews on weight gain, so I made sure not to over-eat even if hungry on it (I didn't have any large hunger changes).  However, I also only took it for 7 days at the most.  Now, when I feel an episode come on, I take it for 1-2 nights and it's succesfully stopped me from having that episode go farther.  

I'm still nervous to use it because of what I've read, but my experience with it has been good with how I am using it (low dose, short periods).  "

Something I thought I would never be able to do again, even with the high dosage of morphine that I'm taking as well as methadone. The first few days I awoke with euphoria but it disappeared.

But during this trial, I was still depressed and ABSOLUTELY could not sleep. I dabbled with many sleep aids but many actually stimulated me or the side effects were too much, or would make me more depressed. I began by taking this to sleep and help with the depression. I took 5mg. I fell right to sleep and awoke 10 hours later. I woke up feeling quite refreshed. I was not tired the next day, and HAD NO DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, which had effected every part of my life for months prior. It worked excellent with Lexapro for my mood, thought process and motivation. I felt amazing, but not drugged, very energized and content. But, I would not stop eating. I have always been able to keep plenty of food and snacks in the house, without temptation to over eat. However, this day was much different. I could not stop eating. I LITERALLY COULD NOT STOP EATING. No matter how full I was, I still COULD NOT STOP EATING. I swore every snack/meal was my last, yet before I knew it, I was eating again, still full. Yet I did not feel nausious like I always have in the past when I had over eaten. I could just eat, and eat and eat. At the end of the day, still snacking and eating, I tallied some of the things I had eatin, and realized I had well exceeded 5000 calories! Amazing, from a person that comfortably eats 2000-3000 calories a day. The next evening i took 2.5mg. But the day after was no different than the one before. I stopped taking it and it took 3-4 days for the habitual eating to start to go away. I took 5mg a week later, with the same gloriously amazing effects on my mood. But it had the same horrific effect on my eating consumption, which took another 3-4 days to begin wearing off. Being overweight is one of the most depressing, uncomfortable and unhealthy things in the world, so why would anyone take this for ANY REASON. DO NOT TAKE THIS. Its comparable to heroin feels great but isnt worth TheSideEffects.

I have a love hate relationship with Zyprexa. I love what it does for my OCD making it very manageable along with improving my depression. Zoloft stopped doing the job by itself and this was added.  That being said, I hate the 40 pound weight gain (now 100 pounds overweight), high cholesterol (never a problem before), and high blood sugar (never a problem before). In addition, in the beginning it makes you very drowsy. I have fallen asleep at my desk at work more than a few times. I take 5mg twice daily. I just finished a trial of Celexa without success.
