0$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$3/25/2019 5:35:20 PM$Reviewer: HM, 25-34 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I take this for ADHD and its transformative. I had ADHD as a child but it was never picked up on until I was in my thirties. I don't know what I could have achieved if I'd had it when I was younger. I was always known for being smart but incapable of applying it, always disconnected, sad and very easily stressed. I'm actually an optimistic and outgoing person after all! I'm on time to appointments and I remember facts about people at work that I never could remember before. One of my children also has ADHD and its a relief to be able to give them the early medication that I didn't have, they are already happier and less stressed with school. 
1$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/24/2016 12:57:19 AM$Reviewer: paul, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$1$if you give this to a child than you should be locked up. parents put me on this back when Ritalin was the drug and let me tell you if you want your child to grow up craving it for the rest of there life then go  ahead anyone who tells you this is not addictive is ignorant and really need to try for themselves. its a upper and i was the first group to be given it in the uk. i wouold be given it befor a meal and it would take my appitite right away and i would be given at tea time so i would wide awake all night this is the worst crawl and in in human way to treat people with quote adhd when the whole. i will tell you. if you give uppers to a child for 5 years then take it away and leave your child with a withdrawal they cannot explain and you ignore and think it is a behavioral issue then you are a fool. i never got over this and hence have to go thou life medicating myself with illegal stimulants not for a high to feel right again. school is for any child with an imagination boring there creativity suppressed by schools and this drug. copying from a book and being wrong for not doing it the way the book does is boring. thia drug ruined my life and will anyone elses who is given this do not get fooled by ads or actors telling you there story because they are lies and anyone who has been given this as a child will see through the lies. if you as a  parent have not gone a week on a stimulant you would never give to your child. compensation should be given to them children but put a price on lifetime addiction and permanent loss of a child's creativity and childhood you could not one week i challange any parent to go on this drug and then see if you would give to your child. and do not get sucked into doctors saying that it works different on kids with adhd is also a lie the kid is not brought to normal even though it may seem like it. its more of a trance or disconnect next time you give to your child watch the spark be taken from his eyes watch as all life is taken
