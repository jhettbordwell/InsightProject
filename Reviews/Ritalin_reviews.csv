1$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/19/2017 1:35:22 PM$Reviewer: Saleen, 13-18 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$It worked certainly for my ADHD. I take 20 mg daily. And definitely notice changes in my mood and concentration. Only thing is. I was on concerta for a while till I tired to overdose on it that's why I switched to Ritalin because Concerta made me sick after I tried to OD. One big difference is the side effects. I experience lots of side effects with this medication and my boyfriend notices it too and absolutely hates that I take this medication because it completely alters me. I can't sleep when I am on this medication because I shake to much and am way to focused on things like now as I am writing the review I know I am only writing it because I have nothing to focus on right now. Another issue is how addictive this is. I had to give my boyfriend the pills because I took them for a week and became addicted. Addiction runs in my family and never in a million years did I think I'd get addicted to Ritalin but I did and I had to stop taking it which means I was more moody and just awful to be around but getting off it was fairly easy for me just not anyone around me. But Ritalin works a lot better than concerta did but the side effects I feel aren't worth it. My anxiety gets worse. I can't eat when I'm on it or I feel physically sick. I can't sleep while on it because my brain I still working to quick. I can type like crazy though obviously. I stutter when I'm on it. And overall I think it's great for school work or exams but I can't do normal everyday things while on it because my brain works faster than I do and it only concentrates on one thing. It also affects my vision and I am not able to drive while I am on it.

I was experiencing Severe anxiety, Tachycardia, and felt like a zombie. Ritalin has changed my life for the better. 20 MG IR 3 times a day has worked amazing for the past 5 years. I'm 20 now. Before Ritalin treatment for my ADD, I couldn't finish a task, I was looked down on as stupid. I also take this med for depression and it's helped it too. The only side effects that are bothersome are complete loss of appetite, mild mood swings, and euphoria. But compared to Vyvanse or Adderall it's a big change. I take Ritalin for my ADD And Depression, Klonopin, Xanax for PTSD, panic disorder and GAD, along with Lisinopril for my hbp. I have seen no interactions in the 5 years of taking this medication.

I can never encourage someone to take this drug due to the symptoms I have and I as a previous user I believe this drug should be used as a last resort. I suffered from depression which was either caused by long time use or it wasn't but what I can say with certainty is my depression/Anxiety was made worst to the extent I became suicidal.  That was 7 years ago and I have been off the drug for 5 years and the symptoms mentioned above has gone completely.

I was on Adderall but my doctor switched me over to Ritalin instant release, this is by far the WORST medicine I have ever taken. Literally NOTHING happened when I took this medicine, made me furious as I have to get an appointment with my doctor AGAIN to switch medicines which is now 30 days away and on top of that I wasted my money on this. Stay away from this drug at all costs!!!
7$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$6/7/2016 6:43:49 PM$Reviewer: jojo1217, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$1$2$I took adderall for the past three years for ADHD, but eventually felt tolerant and told my doctor that I was starting a habit of abusing the drug (started out taking 20mg a day and then started taking 80/100mg a day). So, he prescribed to me Ritalin and after the second day of taking the drug I needed out. I was deeply deeply depressed for hours after, light headed, dizzy, short of breath, irregular heartbeat, and nauseous. Overall, I was nothing like the normal me...I was a straight zombie, I couldn't go to work or even hang out with friends it was so bad. I didn't want to do anything, I can now say I understand why people with depression struggle with thoughts of suicide, because I could never live feeling like I did when I took Ritalin. I wouldn't prescribe it to anyone.

Been taking Ritalin ever since. Helps me focus, stay motivated, especially for work. I live a positive lifestyle. Lost appetite and sleep at first, but I soon got over that.

12$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/18/2016 8:21:15 AM$Reviewer: Beta, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$5$"I always struggled with attention in class in school and college. For exams I would cram just before them. Although I passed exams the lack of revision led to average grades. Later I got easily bored in relationships and when I managed to stay in one and get married that ended in divorce due to basically being inattentive. As an Engineer I was successful, renowned for troubleshooting and inventing. (incl Patents) however always frustrated with inability to focus, do paperwork. Advent of the internet was great to suck up data while hopping from site to site but distraction from task at hand. I was somewhat aware of ADHD but thought it was an issue in kids and I was not hyperactive. 
While spending some time working in the USA and expressing my frustration with someone reporting to me at their lack of detailed reports and late reports (a problem I suffered myself) they commented that they had ADD and so had I. I was 40.They pointed me at some books re Adult ADD and wow what a revelation. It could identify all my strengths and weaknesses. In returning to Europe I suddenly realised how different the awareness was to ADD especially in adults. However I managed to get the diagnosis from a child behaviorist specialist and understanding from my doctor and Ritalin was prescribed. 20mg, 3 times a day. Impact was enormous but over time the effect was wearing off. Also some people complained I could be a pain in my opinionated and forceful view. An unforeseen downside was my pension provider wanted to review the life assurance aspect of my policy as people with ADD were more likely to have risky behavior and be addicted to for example alcohol. (it helps turn down that over active mind at night) 
I decided to take Ritalin not daily but as required to complete a task, like a tax return or expenses. I would use it a couple of times a week. To-do lists and reminders on phones helped. My tolerance to Ritalin reduced again. Relationships and work flourished. Ritalin is a great help. "

Now married and in college, in my first semester in college I knew I needed to see my doctor for help after I had received a ""F"" on my first test. My doctor diagnosed me with ADHD and gave me a prescription for Ritalin. My next test I had received a ""B""."

It hasn't been as effective as other ADHD medications I've taken in the past, however the side effects are so refreshingly mild in comparison that I cannot imagine myself ever taking anything else again. 
The only side effects I have noticed so far have been decreased appetite (which I'm fine with, as exam season and bikini season are one after the other), and some slight behavioural differences. By this I mean that after my Ritalin has worn off, I feel significantly stronger ADHD symptoms than I would normally. However, this hyperactive phase generally subsides within a day or so. "

(Focalin is an isotope of Ritalin) At first I didn't like Ritalin. It seemed too hard, and I would crash after the medicine left my body. Long story short, I cut the dosage and the side effects vanished. It does what it is supposed to do. It allows me to think clearly and focus without making me feel like a zombie, or overly excited. I still prefer Focalin xr, but Ritialin is a fine substitute.

He is in year one and since he started taking this medicine, he is doing great at school. he has started getting better grade at school and teachers are happy too. i do not like to take and give drugs but i think it has been working for my 6 yr old for last one yr now. i hope it continues to work like this. no major side effects apart from loosing a bit weight but i think that is okay if it helps him overall. i honestly want him to stop using this may be in few years time but time will tell..the only reason i am writing this to let everyone know that it may help your child. i wish you all good luck and please write more reviews which can help other people...thank you.

At the time I didn't realize how important it was and how badly I needed to be medicated. In college it helped me  tremendously with studying, reading, testing and paying attention. At works it totally keeps me focused and gives me energy. I can follow conversations like ""normal"" people, pay attention and follow to movies and tv.
It does reduce appetite but I make an effort to eat before I take it. And obviously it affects sleep. I try not to take my meds too late, also, my Dr also has me on trazadone (sleepy pill)
There is always a possibility of addiction but your Dr should be monitoring you. (I've had countless people try to buy my Rx...even steal.

Lastly, let's say you run out of your meds and you can't get them filed for a few days... in my experience I have had horrible withdrawal. I couldn't stop sleeping but when I was awake all I wanted to do was eat. I became listless and fricken exhausted for a few days.
The good outweighs the bad with this drug. It's definitely abused by the wrong people."

I was taking zolof after my pregnancy thinking I needed it, but I still had had issues with depression and not being able to focus or remember anything, etc.   I have neuropathy also, and where my tips are numb and tingly otherwise, with ritalin, I can feel them now. I focus much better, finish my tasks nicely, am in a positive mood, and feel 'normal'.. lol.     Seriously though, I'm prescribed 3x a day, but I only use it 2x and none after about 2pm, that way it kills off in time for bedtime.  No problems yet.
21$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/27/2014 8:08:34 PM$Reviewer: ADHDkid, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$My psychiatrist switched me to Ritalin after I had negative side effects with Adderall and Vyvanse. I took the Ritalin once and knew it wouldn't work. I also have depression, and I had been feeling rather low around the time I started Ritalin. The very first day I took the Ritalin, I knew the moment it wore off. Suddenly, I had no desire to live anymore. I wasn't suicidal; I simply had no energy. None. Not a bit. My lethargy was complete. I found myself standing in the middle of a field, staring, not feeling that I even had the energy to wonder how I had gotten there. Honestly, I would rather be unable to focus than feel that terrible every single time my meds wear off.

I was a child in the 60's when I first started yes, there are side effects with the drug, in the 60's this drug was new and little known about I started in 1969-1972, this should be interesting this time around just to see if the still uses the same chemical compounds.
24$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/3/2014 3:56:20 AM$Reviewer: Chris C, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$"After about 10-12 weeks of prescribed use for ADD at age 25, my sleep cycle became completely random, with awake periods ranging from 12-36 hours and sleep ranging from 6-12 hours.  My sleep ""tumbled"" around the clock like a tennis shoe in a dryer, only somewhat related to day/night.  It took about 7 years for the effect to lessen enough where I could manage it, but still 14 years later it requires effort can be annoying to manage.  Prior to taking the drug, I did struggle a little bit to get to sleep and to wake up, it had no real impact and no one ever expressed concern that it wasn't normal.  After taking the drug; however, I saw year after year go by, unable to work, unable to function in a normal way and take care of myself, and so frequently asleep during the day that I was unable to sustaining an effort to even get help."

Ritalin IR was the first ADHD stimulant med that I tried and WOW.. I was totally amazed at how much it improved my 'get up and go' and ability to sustain focus on boring tasks. I titrated up to 20mg x 4 per day from my original 10mg x 3 and even though over time the med decreased in effectiveness it was still highly effective. The trick is to understand that when tolerance kicks in the is still working you just need to work with it rather than let the med do all the work like at the start. Better than Dexedrine IR for lock-on focus but inferior when it comes to improving organisation. Overall though its a highly effective, life-changing med.

Adderall restricted my diet, caused minor depression, and even sleeping problems, unlike my concerta and methylphenidate (Ritalin based drugs). To be honest I think its safe to say that Ritalin is a powerful stimulant with a few addictive qualities for teens of my age. Sorry I cant recommend any speciffic ADD/ADHD medication that doesn't have any downsides. Out of those 3 above prescriptions listed, I believe ritalin is the most effective

Of the 50 or so comments I read about this drug, 90 percent of Ritalin's users say that after 6-9 months after starting this drug, it was ineffective and caused major side effects, I'm no doctor but  if I were, I would only prescribe this drug for short periods, like 6-12 months.

Do not listen to anyone who attempts to justify that Ritalin is safe, it is not. I, alongside some close friends and family, have been prescribed for several years and it is very clear the changes in our personality. The creativity and humour we once had has been replaced by depressing thoughts, mood swings and above all a very strong dependency on a drug that now dictates our lives. In contradiction to my doctor's words, Ritalin is not safe nor necessary and believe me once you begin to take it, you will find yourself lost without it.

It works really well for me most of the time. I still have to work really hard to start tasks but once I do, I focus much better than usual. I took other stuff but this is the best so far. The lack of appetite sucks because I already forget to eat sometimes when I'm either really focused or really unfocused, so not ever being hungry means I don't have a natural reminder to eat. Alarms work pretty well though and if that's the worst of my side effects, I'm alright with it!

Years ago went to doc with chest pains and after ruling out physical aliment, he referred me to a physiologist. Head doc diagnose me with add and gave me strattera. didn't know much about it but it turned my life around. Had problems peeing, hurt ejaculate, and after taking cold meds one winter I had serous high blood pressure. Body doc told me to stop, and the head doc started me down the road of lexapro and other meds that made me not give a damn.  Got off those after my house went to crap...and wasted 8 years of my life.  Recently started screwing up at work, and relizing I couldn't get anything done outside of work, went back to my 3rd head doc and ask for generic add med. He tried to put me on prozac, saying it was the same as ritalin, adderall, but I wasn't buying it.  He put me on 30 mg ritalin and what a help! First day I notice I was slowing down, not making the mistakes I once made, taking care of my home and myself on only 2 5 mg dose. I like that you can cut the instant release pills in half, I have for months settled on taking 10 in the morning and 2 half throughout the day.  That is all I need, no side effects, I like that I can take only what I need unlike stattera and adderall which you are stuck with the dose and side effects.  No dry mouth, dribble peeing, or obsessive thoughts as with stattera.  Course maybe I was on too high a dose with stattera, who knows?  Just hate that I have to see the doc every month, wish he could do refills so i could cut back on visits, wait times are an hour or more.  There is a stigma and fear attached to these drugs because some abuse them, too sad.

Generally after I eat all I want to do is sleep.I crash and sleep so hard it is if I have been drugged. If I awake to go to the bathroom I generally feel hungry and often have to fight the urge to go to the kitchen for a snack. I've never been a candy or junk food eater but find myself craving chocolate and chips. Will wake up and eat junk food and go right back to sleep. I dont like this drug.

According to my parents, I had hallucinations, would wake up screaming in the night, as well as break out in twitches. They took me off it after one month of use, and I was put on another medication. I believe it was Concerta. I was on Concerta for the next 15 years of my life.
I still suffer from uncontrollable hand shaking as a side effect of using the Ritalin at such a young age. This is NOT a safe drug for children to be on. It should be taken off the market for children under the age of 16."

I started on concerta ER, which was perfect, no side effects, no notice at all in change of behaviour. lost my insurance and could no longer afford it. its 135 without insurance! so i had to switch to generic ritalin, I take just 10-20mgs,the smallest dose avail. If i have a busy day or meetings, ill take the 20, but usually just a 10mg dose is good. I dont feel or notice anything at all, but I do know it works because im able to focus, work, and i don't forget things or my mind doesn't wander. Scary moments like forgetting my 8 mnth old son on by bed and he rolls off it on to the floor. NOT GOOD! LUCKILY bed is close to the floor and we have thick carpet and he just kind of slid off it, but still reminded me that I have to be more alert and if im watching him myself i take larger dose. It does wonders. Sometimes Ill have these weird panic attacks in middle of the night. I wake up alarmed, with a sense of doom or that im dying or choking, but then i realize in 5 seconds or so that im just having an episode or dream and that I'm fine. I get a drink of water and go back to bed. see your doctor to try different doses or even different meds, but it takes few weeks to settle in and get used to. you can't make decisions based on just a week of use or a few days. hope this helps.

I was then also diagnosed with ADD. I am in the beginning of trying to control this for myself though I have been researching and controlling it for my son for over 5 years. My son takes concerta and it seems to be working for now but I have earned that sometimes you have to switch up meds to keep them effective. I would also suggest anyone needing this kind of treatment see an actual Psychiatrist he has been a life saver for me ... Anyway Ritilin is working for me so far.. I do experience the tight jaw... mild headaches and nausia.  I found if I eat something about 30 minutes after taking it no headache or nausia.. I do tend to not sleep well if I take my last dose too late. But I can concentrate so much better and I get so much more accomplished. At first it did cause me to be irratable but I think that was more me being able to focus on everything going on around me instead of feeling like there was a movie playing in the background. I go back for a check up soon and it will be 3 weeks of taking this med. but so far so good.. Its not perfect or a miracle but it is helping.

Sounds like a miracle drug, right? No! I got so completely addicted to it it drove me crazy. When my doctor took me off of it I would regularly go down to Mexico where I could buy it without a prescription and smuggle it back across the border, I did this for almost 2 years. Luckily, I moved much further north so driving to Mexico was no longer an option, so I'm finally off of it for good. I probably should have gone to some kind of Ritalin rehab. Ritalin also made me want to smoke cigarettes all the time, which is totally disgusting. But now without Ritalin, I no longer want to smoke, it makes me sick just to smell it.

It was very hard to find a MD doctor that believed in giving Ritalin to someone over the age of 18. I finally found a psychiatrist that would. Before I started my meds I had very hard times with home(not able to complete choirs), school (Very poor grades & placed in special class), work (avg job lasting 2-3 months),  projects (I would start them and never finish them), and couldn't keep any long term relationships my whole life. My parents refused that I have had any issues with ADD or ADHD my whole life. They thought I was just the way my brain developed and I was ""Lazy, Procrastinator, Unreliable, Absentminded, Never finish anything I started"" I think they may have been embarrassed of the term ""ADD & ADHD"" in the 1970's. My family, friends, and I cannot believe the changes that the medication has done. It has changed me 180.  I have some books that I also found that has helped me deal with and understand ADD. One book is called ""A.D.D. & Romance"" by Jonathan Halverstadt, ""You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!"" by Kate Kelly & Peggy Ramundo. "

I took it on and over over 3-4 years. However, I started to take more and more to get the same effect, as you start to get immune to the effects of a lower dosage after continued use. Then I started overdosing.
I do not recommend Ritalin at all, as it is easy to get hooked on to the point where you're dependant on that weird high you get from it."

Admittedly, Ritalin was one of the few drug treatments available then.  However, I have tried many other drugs over the years to enhance concentration. Still I have yet to discover any therapy, (chemical or otherwise), that has proven to be nearly as cost-effective or time-efficient as regular Ritalin (time-release Ritalin is expensive).  Although... I would highly recommend that anyone suffering from ADHD seek behavioral, cognitive, or other psychological therapy - in addition to medicinal treatment.

I started on the standard 5mg twice a day.  After about 3 days I could notice a big difference in my ablility to focus and concentrate.  After a week I moved up to 10mg twice a day and then 10 mg three times daily.  I experienced some of the side effects; dry mouth, not hungry, sleeplessness, racing pulse and higher blood pressure, tiredness.  Sleeplessness AND tiredness, well after taking the first dose you hit your peak after about 1-2 hrs and then come back down(crash) which tires you out, take the next dose and go back on that rollercoaster.  I finally figured out how to space my doses out so it would be worn off by the time I needed to get to sleep and for me that was taking the last dose by 3pm so I could hit the sheets by 10pm.  I hated that roller coaster ride so I talked with my doc and he put me on 20mg extended release that I take twice daily.  The effect lasts between 4-8 hrs.  I get up at 5am for work and then go to night school and am home by 930.  Long hours to be needing focused and the extended release is the perfect fit for me.  If the effect is wearing off too fast ask about the extended release and you will be a lot happier.  I do get a slight headach but goes away after eating.

So far, I am somewhat pleased with the results.  I don't really have any complaints about it.  So far, my side effects are very mild and don't really interfere with my everyday life.  I started on 5 mg the first week and have moved up to 10 mg, taken twice a day.  I have noticed that my brain does not go a mile a minute any more which makes it easier to concentrate.  I have noticed that I remember things that I would normally forget.  My mood has been so much more calm and my angry outbursts have practically gone completely away.  I do find that I am a little more tired but my increase in mood helps me to overcome that.  No trouble going to sleep but staying asleep is the problem.  I find I am a little more jittery than usual, again not a big deal.  I still forget things on a daily basis, but not near as much as before.  My husband has even noticed a change in my mood, for the better.  I find that it is easier for me to stay on task at work and to prioritize my work more effectively.  I still find myself being distracted a little, but not as much as before the medication.  So, far I have been satisfied with the medication and would recommend it to women my age who have just been diagnosed with Adult ADD, as in my case.

Then I had to keep upping my doses. And then it started working for shorter periods of time. And then it got to a point where I had to take too much too often that it started causing severe ups and downs in energy. I then got on Strattera which works but I had all of the physical side effects and it wasn't worth it anymore. Now I'm starting on Concerta (I'm 27 yrs old now). I think people have to try different things to see what works for them. Also, sometimes you just have to switch after awhile because your body gets used to the medicine. So maybe I'll take Concerta for awhile and then if it stops helping, I'll go back on Strattera.

As part of our ongoing search to discover the medication and dosage that is best for me, my doctor recently prescribed Ritalin.  Unfortunately, the side effects of the medication were such that, after only a week, he took me off the Ritalin and put me back on the medication I was taking previously (Dexedrine).  (Note: Anyone reading this review should remember that what medications and dosages work for ADHD can vary greatly from person to person)  For me, the Ritalin made me feel like I was so exhausted I couldn't think straight.  It also made me both depressed and anxious.  In fact, I am also taking Lexapro to treat depression and when I was taking the Ritalin, the Lexapro stopped working.  Far from providing any sort of help for my ADHD, the Ritalin erased all energy or desire I had to do anything except sleep or cry.  I am very glad to no longer be taking this medication!!!

Dr said to wait at least 2 weeks to see improvment at school, but after 3 days we got a letter from the teacher saying he was listening to instructions better and staying in his seat at lunch, whereas before he was running aroud the lunchroom. He says he doesn't eat lunch at school anymore because he isn't hungry, but he usually eats breakfast before it kicks in and supper when it starts to wear off.  So it does have some effect on his appetite, but we just give him snacks and things whenever he IS hungry so that hasn't been to much of a problem. We tried Vyvanse before and that was a NIGHTMARE!!  We are very happy with this medicine. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it is short acting.

The upside to ritalin is that it is MUCH cheaper. The downside is having to take it more than once in a day. And in general, the side effects are true. Which can be the downside to these type of drugs. For instance, I know to make sure and have it filled on time because if I don't take it, I literally cannot function because I am so tired. And the crash and the end of the day sucks too. I'm now 20, and can safely say that for me, all the drugs pretty well have worked the same, and for the most part have been effective if taken properly.

His teacher wanted him tested for ADD/ADHD. So we took the Conners Check List. Then we got a second opinion from a child psychologist who then diagnosised him with moderate ADHD. He had started Ritalin 4 months ago. He is taking it twice a day at 10mg ea. He is much calmer and more focused now. He enjoys reading more then he did be for. All I can say it has worked for us.

But then I did talk, I would be really into to it and talk a long time.  But in the end it affected my blood pressure and creatnin levels so I had to quit. But it had pulled me out of my fog far enough to let me funtion wihtout it again, so I ma happy that I used it. It did crave it for about a year after I quit, but I know that I cannot affor to ruin my kidneys just to get ahead at work.

I have had problems getting passing grades in college but I feel like I have more focus and can remember the lectures a lot better than I did before being on the medication.

This drug is a god send, however, I know I might have the genes that make me prone to addiction. With that in mind, I take this drug sparingly, when I know I will need it, and it has worked like a charm.  I do not take it everyday, and always take a 3 month holiday during the summer.  The trick is to take it at the very beginning of your day, and scheduale your day around when the drug will be most effective, so that you can use it and still sleep at night.  I just wonder about having caffeine with ritalin.

I was diagnosed with ADD my senior year of college (over 10 years ago) and had been taken Ritalin ever since.  I agree with all the comments about experiencing the jitters and how you can operate with little sleep.  Despite the side effects, it was a miracle!  I had always taken the max dosage 20 mg/x3.  Over the years I started to see a decrease in effectiveness and even tried other drugs - strattera, adderall, wellbuterin...nothing as effective as ritalin.  Even now I feel somewhat addicted and have even exceeded the max dosage signifcantly.  (For those others who had concerns - ritalin is addictive, esp mentally in my case.)  Needless to say, I've gotten off of it completely for approximately 2 months.  I've been struggling like all of us with true ADD, but I had to prove that I could function without it.  For those of you in the same boat as me, take a break from it.  Once you get back on the ritalin after a break it becomes more effective again. (Just make sure you regulate yourself...I have to divide up my doses by week, and hide the rest.  If I run out then I have to make do without!)  Hopefully this helps!  (Please share your experiences here if anyone knows of anything else that helps with ADD/Depression.)  Thanks, and Good Luck!   :)

I was Diagnosed 3 years ago after being advised to do so by a colloge professor.  Thank God I did. I had immediate major improvement on day 1.  I started on the non time lapsed dose and it made me crash hard;I would end up with headaches. I loved the effects, but the headaches were becoming daily problems. My doctor put me on the time lapsed pills and I have been good for over a year now.  I graduated high school with a 1.2 G.P.A, barely getting by. Stupidity was acceptance when it came to my self image. I am currently in college finishing up my degree with a 4.0. G.P.A. Not bad considering I was expelled from my first high school and maintained less than C average most of my life. It causes some jitters at first, like way to much coffee jitters, but that subsides over time. It pulls your focus so you stay in 1 lane at a time by filing your thoughts. It feels good to finally see your mind as a gift instead of a curse. Afterall, we are some quick thinkers, so just imagine being able to organize all those precious thoughts to be saved for the right time and place. Good Luck!

Went to Family practice physician and after trial and error of medications I found Retalin non time released tablets to work best.  I was placed on the maximum amount of medication allowed per month by a regular MD which was one 20mg. tabled 3 x daily.  Now after being on this dosage for a few years it just dosent have the effect it once did.  I was maxed out by my physician which gave me no choice but to stay at the same level of medicaiton.  I lost my health insurance and this med (generic or not) just is not available thru a discount pharmacy (walmart, etc).  I lost my job (again) and always struggle financially.  I want to stop the cycle of constant struggle.  I have not afforded or had regular couseling or guidance due to little income.  I feel little to no effects from the drug and need a higher dosage to get back on track.  The family practive physician can not up my dosage and I do not know how to go about getting past this.  I have heard of children on higher dosage's than me.  Is there help for me?  How can I get passed this?

It has had to be increased to three times a day already and he still cannot sit still or concentrate at all.  It may be a cure-all for some, but not for our family.

Not quite enough mg's to get through day but better than the ""2 pot a day"" coffee habit that I had before. I did not seek treatment until 30 years of age and so I did not take Ritalin until then.  At 30yrs of age I finally had a neuropsyc exam to see if there were any learning disabilities.  Diag'ed with ADHD but also with assessed IQ at above 90% of population.  ADD is real and any who doubt it have no clue.  It's a shame they can't experience it for one day.  It was not until the neuropsyc exam, resultant ADHD diagnoses, and Ritalin script; that I found peace.  Prior to I might as well have had an IQ of 50.  This whole time I thought that I was below average IQ & ability.  I barely grad'ed H.S.  At this time my social skills were poor, I had great hyperactivity, and also no ability to focus.  Resultant poor self-esteem leading to anger/frustration and then illicit drug use to ""self-medicate"" as they say. My life was problematic before due to impulsivity as well and the usual inability to focus. Everyone around me would joke of ADD but I didn't take it seriously. After starting Ritalin I am now a college student w/3.0 avg GPA in the hardest Mathematics sequence that exists on this planet. God Bless Ritalin. I hope that parents out there with a kid who fits this description of my past doesn't fall victim to the hype that this drug is destructive. Sure, any substance can be misused.  However, if a doc recommends it for these symptoms in a person, it's worth a shot; a shot at life. My life is just beginning at and it could have started so long ago had this pharmaceutical solution been taken earlier on in my life.  Look at the long-term studies of this drug. It's track record is good and my worst day on Ritalin is still better than my better days off of it. Exercise helps, Ritalin solves. If this becomes a permanent solution then so be it.

This drug seriously and I mean seriously damaged me. It enlarged my heart, gave me a heart attack, made my palms very sweaty, my body jittery and depressed most of the time and actually made my concentration many times worse. I became unable to feel rested on this drug and it took me hours to fall asleep. This drugged completely turned me against the use of any drugs in the human body. By simply giving myself large amounts of very nutrient dense foods (fresh farmers market organic produce) and completely removing all unnatural food additives (food colorings, monosodium glutamate, refined sugar...) I was able to completely cure my ADHD, feel calm and relaxed all the time. 8 hours of intense studies is now easily in reach for me. I would suggest to people that before using this drug to perhaps get off the sugar, msg, food colorings, low vitamin and mineral foods as thousands of studies show the relation between nutrition and mental abilities. Also, let me tell you that getting off this drug was very painful and saddening for me. Talk to your doctor about this, all the information that I am telling you is my own opinion and I am not a medical doctor, though I now have over 8000 thousand hours of nutritional studies.
