0$Condition: Depression$11/21/2015 1:00:17 AM$Reviewer: The bear , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$3$I have been taking Nardil for over a year now, and whilst it has helped a bit, I am still suffering. I have had two different augmenting agents prescribed but have just had to spend 4 weeks in hospital.  While I was there a doctor mistakenly halved my dose from 120 mg a day to 60.  In less than 36 hours the effect was horrific, my depression was a lot worse and withdrawl effects were terrible.  Never allow your dose to be reduced as quickly!

Is there another type of medication which I can add?"

I follow the diet guidelines to the ""tee"", wear a Medic Alert Chain, have had 2 surgeries while on Nardil and doctors and surgeons who make themselves knowledgeable about Phenelzine there will not be a problem with other drug, food interactions.  I do know what would have happened to me if my psychiatrist would not have tried phenelzine (Nardil)."
4$Condition: Depression$12/26/2008 10:38:28 PM$Reviewer: Xavier, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I had a shocking depression, coupled with a debilitating axiety disorder. Sadly none of the SSRI, SSRNI or tricyclics worked for me. Then came a miracle named Nardil (phenelzine). It WORKED and wonderfully so! Not only did my depression lift but so did my anxiety which was more debilitating than the depression.
