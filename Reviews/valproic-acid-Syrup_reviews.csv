I have since stopped taking both but while I was on them both I was very uncomfortable and I was far more mentally unstable. I was very aggressive and lethargic.

While escitalopram isn't listed as one of the drugs it can react with I would still say to be careful with it. At the time I was under 18 and I'd approximate about 130lbs, and 5'2"" if that helps. Sex is female."

Anyway, for its primary use, it's effective.
4$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$8/14/2014 5:45:36 PM$Reviewer: $5$5$5$"I could write a novel on Rx Bi-polar meds after dealing with bi-polar for over 20 yrs.  The true issue is preventing manic episodes.  Valproic is one of only 3 meds that do that well, and also stop them during a manic phase.  The meds work great for both!  I have been on and off them due to side effect concerns.  They are NOT good for your liver.  Your liver is a super organ that does so many things for you.  I have been off this med for over a year now.  I have no depression and no manic episodes.  Getting ALL nutrients, exercise, adequate sleep and avoiding STESS is key.  Bi-polar is not a disease, it is a nutrient deficiency that causes imbalances in neurotransmitters!  People dealing with ""bi-polar"" need ALL nutrients and it will go away.  These meds are invaluable to bring a manic episode under control, however, they due not ""cure the disease"".  The cure is nutrients...ALL of them!  The key nutrients for the neurotransmitters for bi-polar are: FOLATE (Not, absolutely not folic acid! Never consume folic acid!!), CHOLINE, IRON, B6, B12 all amino acids, & MAGNESIUM. Research on the net food sources for them, and consider supplements.  However, 99% of all ""vitamin supplements"" are not vitamins.  Even the ones at health food stores!  They are pharmaceutical grade analogs (PGA's).  They are horrible for your body, cause cancer, and do not work in the same way as REAL vitamins from REAL food.  If you research PGA's and how they make them and from what you will be horrified!  Do not put them in your body!  Instead, research ""real food source vitamin supplements"" and choose a good one.  The one I selected is from Sunwarrior company because it had the adequate levels and correct ratios of B vitamins.  I make a shake every morning with Gold Standard Whey protein powder, Twinlabs brewer's yeast, Spirulina, 1cup oatmeal softened in hog water, 1 frozen bannana, empty the herbs & supplements caps into it.  I eat only whole, non-gmo, real food. That's all nutrients in a glass!"

I have gained 35 lbs in 5 months and lost over half my hair by the time my doctor told me to stop this medication. I had decreased my dose to 1/4 mgs until I could see her. This caused me to become more anxious than ever and began having bad anxiety attacks. Been off it for 2 weeks and my hair is still falling out really bad. My pharmacist suggested I take AG Pro (behind the counter at Wal-Mart but non-prescription). I am extremely unsatisfied with this medication and wish I had never started taking it.

Very bad reaction, incuding inability to walk, tremors, shaking etc.  This came in a large oval pill, produced as depakene on the label, the pill had ""Devil"" or something similiar imprinted on it by the drug company.  Those who have taken Depakote on the East Coast should be careful when changing to this ""generic"" - same for the klonopin I was taking - it changed to a green rather than blue pill in the West (Colorado).  Generics are not always the same as the brand name - depakote has two generics that are actually chemically different.  "

This drug has caused many problems.
I have been taking for many years.
Effects have never been told, only liver, which count is starting to fall.
I intend to see a neurologist immediatly to be taken off this drug. I have had epilepsy since i was twelve, and many types of drugs. I have all three types of epilepsy, and now reaching towards 50, and never going any length of time without seizures, one neurologist increased the dosage...and i didnt have the sense god gave me to look this drug up. If your doctor suggests putting you on this drug, ask for an alternative, i currently take 1250mg in morning and at night, as well as lamactogine and lorazepam. This drug does no good for anyone with our disability, please dont think that this drug will control your seizures. Thank You
