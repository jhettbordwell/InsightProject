0$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/26/2019 11:54:19 PM$Reviewer: KT, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$3$When I was initially prescribed it, I was directed to take a half (100 mg) table the first day, then a full one the second day, and increase by one each day until 300 mg. I barely made it to 300 mg. I guess you cant be bipolar if you're in a coma! I had weird dreams and slept 12  hours. When I was awake, I ate everything in sight. I had difficulties driving to work because I was extremely exhausted and veered a little of the road. I stopped taking it when I almost wrecked. I will try any medication, but this one, again.

In those five years I have stopped cleaning my house, stopped walking, stopped doing my art, stopped going out it's a chore just to go to the doctor.  All I want to do is sleep or watch T.V.  I have no life left since I started taking Seroquel. I am lazy, lazy, lazy!  Not to mention that I've gained 75 pounds on this awful med. because it makes you crave sweets and all carbs like crazy! I heard this drug is extremely difficult to get off from.

4$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/28/2019 6:44:04 PM$Reviewer: Bluntlady, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed 100mg seroquel by my psychiatrist about a month ago. Make sure you read all possible side effects because there are a lot and some are pretty serious! I cut my dose in half to 50mg because 100mg was way too strong. I have to take it no later than 11pm or i am exhausted the whole next day. So far I have had no side effects from the drug. I take it in combination with Lamictal 300mg and lexapro 20mg in the morning and xanax as needed. This medication has worked great for me. It helps me sleep well and I am noticably more calm. I haven't had to take my xanax nearly as much. It has lowered my anxiety and i have had no severe mood swings or huge breakdowns since i have started it. I have had no weight gain or change in appetite. It is important you have blood work done regularly as it can change cholesterol levels and white blood cell count.

Helps you sleep.  For years could not get up, really fuzzy brain fog until noon or later, could not sleep without it once you get on it. I finally swithced to Latuda and realized how bad this stuff is.  I stopped this right away and went down to half of the Depakote (soon to be fully off).   My brain is clear, I have no druggy head, I can get up in the morning without feeling hung over.  Recommend if you feel hung over in the morning stop taking it.  I didn't even realize how bad it was until I just switched to Latuda.

11$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/14/2016 8:39:02 AM$Reviewer: Sah, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$1$"I was put on 100mg seroquel about a year ago for bipolar depression and severe anxiety. In the beginning it was fantastic. Helped my depression alot. But after a few months it started to change. My memory deteriorated very rapidly. I was always confused and lost slight motor skills, talking proper sentences and hand eye coordination became difficult. I became so scared. I didn't feel pain or happiness. I was completely numb like a robot. Sleeping days at a time. Forgetting shifts at work falling asleep everywhere I sat down. I had to get off I feared it was going to kill me. 
I tapered to 50mg then 25mg over about 2 months. I'm completely off now for about 3-4 weeks. Instantly my memory became clearer. Side effects at the beginning were extreme irratibility, anger and constant migraine. Few weeks later I am now getting severe nausea, worse migraine, extreme anxiety/panic attacks, always so thirsty, insomnia, very sensitive to light and I feel like I'm losing touch with reality. Hard to explain although worst experience of my life. This drug should ONLY be prescribed for extreme life or death cases. Or banned. It's disgusting. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  "
12$Condition: Bipolar Depression$9/12/2016 3:16:18 PM$Reviewer: Mike, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$Seroquel did not help my depression, did not help me sleep better and did not help my appetite. What it did do is cause me to gain a ton of weight overnight. This medication simply did not work for me.

I hate the weight gain, but it works well for my Bipolar. I went off of it for a while about a year ago. Not good. It does work for me, so I figure I've got 2 choices in life. Be fat and sane or skinny and crazy. I'll take sanity thanks.
15$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/25/2016 9:48:08 PM$Reviewer: QuestionPrescripDrugs, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$5$I have been off this medication for years now. But I used it for 2.5 years from ages 15-17. It was horrible, but I was also misdiagnosed with Bipolar. It made me tired, cranky, nauseous and unable to eat for a month at a time, gave me headaches, and made me dizzy. There were plenty of times when I consumed huge amounts of alcohol and pot with Seroquel, which was never a good experience. Don't ever do it! Please. I was originally put on 400 mg and they upped it to 800mg gradually, (when you're first put on the drug, you feel drunk for about a week).I finally had enough and stopped using it cold turkey. I had physical withdrawal for three months - similar to a heroin withdrawal (from what I've read in relation to my symptoms). The drug increased my heart rate astronomically - I was seeing stars quite a bit. It made me crave unhealthy foods which didn't help, and made me gain unhealthy weight. Before you go on this drug, seriously contemplate whether you actually need it. And NEVER mix it with another substance. As a healthcare worker, I would NEVER put a teenager on this drug, unless they had severe schizophrenic symptoms. I started to develop facial twitches after awhile and slurred speech. It took a couple years and major lifestyle changes until all of these effects completely dissipated. The only thing I appreciated about Seroquel was its ability to put me to sleep, and keep me asleep, as I have a hard time staying asleep throughout the night. However, it caused me to have many bouts of sleep paralysis.

18$Condition: Bipolar Depression$11/10/2015 10:35:20 AM$Reviewer: LizzieMmmkay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$"Based on all the reviews I read prior to taking it and the initial warning from my doctor about potential grogginess I can say Seroquel had the complete opposite side effect on me. I can only explain it as ""Restless ass and mouth syndrome"". I was doing wind sprints in my back yard just to shake off the uncontrollable urge to move. Not only that it made me want to eat the butt off a cow and talk nonstop. I could not sleep and didn't feel it did much to treat my depression. I ended up stopping it before my month was up because the side effects were not worth taking anymore even if there was a potential light at the end of the tunnel. That being said everyone is different and I know people that take Seroquel and it's helped them immensely so really it all boils down to the individual."

The only problem I have had with seroquel is I talk in my sleep and I do it every night my daughter told me so she is 21 and I never beleived her so she videoed me haha Now I believe her for sure! It is funny to me but keeps her up at night! I mumble and talk and say weird stuff never before did i ever do this but one other problem is weight gain but the medicine isn't making me gain weight it is the food i tend to blame it on the seroquel i dont get enough excercize and i love sweets well of course i am gonna gain weight but i definetly sleep my eight hours when i wake up i feel great not tired but some people say they feel tired after taking this drug but not everybody can take this drug and feel wonderful like me it has helped my bipolar it feels like it is totally gone i hardly ever ever get depressed anymore and before that i cried every other freakin day for no reason at all it was so horrible being in my skin i hated it . If i were to stop this drug or some moron convinced the drug company to stop making it because they think it is so deadly for everyone just cause it did not work FOR THEM I would literally end up in a mental institution! I NEED MY SEROQUEL UNLIKE some people that want everyone to stop taking it ! U should know better once u take this medication you are supposed to lay down and go to bed not go steal milk at the store!

Like others say, it does knock you on your backside. With that said, it has been almost four years since my last inpatient treatment and I can live with that. I've gotten used to the side affects which for me are mostly the comatose feeling. I take it at bedtime and it helps me to sleep then ""wears off"" and I feel much better during the day. I tried MANY others and this is the one that works for me. It's not perfect but it's better than the alternative....."
23$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/15/2015 6:58:41 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been taking only 50 mg of Seroquel  a night for sleep and that puts me out.  I see a lot of people talking about 200 mg plus, I can't imagine that.  This medicine along with effexor has worked for my depression but I'm trying to get off of them since I have the worst side effects with weight gain and short term memory loss.  I literally feel like I've smoked a joint every time I take this pill.  For mood swings, it has helped a little, but I feel like a healthy life style is what has been best for me in the past.  Healthy eating and exercise can work miracles.  When I was drinking and partying and not working a lot it was depressing and that made me lose it a little.  So I have been on this med since 2009 bbut I have also still struggled with sobriety completely.

I have been taking this drug since 2001 without noticeable side effects and it has put my condition in remission!
I had problems sleeping prior to taking this medication. I now sleep about 8 hours/night. I do wake up feeling a little sleepy, but this passes quickly and I am able to go about my day.
I take 350 mg/day in the evening about two hours before going to sleep."

30$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/8/2015 7:38:52 PM$Reviewer: ThinkingMonkey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I was prescribed 300mg of Seroquel several years ago by my psychiatrist for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I was also taking about 8 others. Didn't help much and as many of you may have experienced with it, I had a massive weight gain and slept like 20 hours a day. I normally weigh around 200 but was at 260 after about 2 1/2 months(!). I told her I wasn't taking it anymore, it wasn't helping and it had those very severe eating and sleeping side effects. Well, fast forward about 6 years and 2 psychiatrist later and now the new doctor decides Seroquel is a really good idea, 900mg at that, triple what had messed me up so bad earlier. I told her I wasn't taking it but she insisted I at least try it. Lo and behold I felt like a new man and I had no sleeping or eating side effects whatsoever! I couldn't believe it. So I've been taking that dosage for about 3 years now and it works pretty well. The combination of medicine I now take, quite a bit of it, does seem to hinge on my 3mg daily of Ativan though. If I miss a couple of doses it seems to throw EVERYTHING out of whack. None of the other medications seem to work right anymore. So I guess this review is pretty worthless because what I'm saying from personal experience is that Seroquel is horrible and you gain 30 pounds a month and sleep all day and night, but later experience with it proved to work pretty darn good. I would say 'great' but I don't think any medication works 'great', except for Nexium, that is. :)
31$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/20/2014 5:16:57 AM$Reviewer: jess, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$"I started my journey with Seroquel 200mg and Lamictal 25mg after a year long battle of emotional problems, depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts without the help of medications. Immediately after I took my prescribed meds back in Oct 2013, they stopped my suicidal thoughts and overactive thoughts, just at the right time before I decide to do anything rash. My Seroquel doses was altered, at various times, I was on 100mg, 150mg and 200mg. 

The most common side effects were drowsiness, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache and stuffy nose. The worrying one is nose bleed. It made my nostrils so dry it bled when I picked them for a little. 

Overall, I like the medication even though it made me feel like a zombie. I regain stability almost immediately after treatment. There were fluctuating mood episodes - one stressing depressive episode lasting 2-3 weeks - but other than that, things were pretty much fine. After around7 months of treatment, I started seeing a clinical psychologist for therapy and hoping  I can make long lasting changes in my relationships with people.  "

About 40 minutes after taking it I am knocked on my butt. Sometimes this means the tv is left on including all of the lights. And I am dead to the world. I wake up feeling drugged and this lasts for hours. I have no interest in living much, no social life, no drive. Interesting because I completed a 4-year degree recently. Seroquel sucks and I am dizzy all of the time, I've fallen down at work. My doctor doesn't want to hear it, so I turn to webmd to give my bad review. One day I'll make it, off all of the meds, and will deal with my life and my mood on my own, instead of being told I need a heavy, toxic, soul-killing drug in my body to be 'normal' boring and dead inside all the time. I haven't had a relationship in 5 years, since beginning seroquel, my period also became irregular.

I take 200 mg before bed and sleep pretty well. At first, I did have some vivid and anxious dreams but that tapered off after time.  If I still have trouble staying asleep I can take .5 mg Xanax and the combination usually puts me in a restful sleep.  No hangover effect for me.  No ill effects at all, really.  I also take 200 mg Lamictal along with 150 mg Wellbutrin  and most days about .5 mg of Adderall in the morning.  Then another 100 Lamictal at night.  After decades of ""spinning the wheel of antidepressants"", this combo finally has yielded a very positive result.  No more highs and lows.  A great deal more focus, energy, concentration and drive.  Helped me end my love affair with alcohol too...no serious anxiety or worries to hide from. Everything seems a lot less complicated and easier to deal with.  It's not that my life is without problems, it's just a lot easier to assess, address, and handle things.  I have actually lost weight probably due to the Adderall.  As far as my dosage, I could keep adjusting up or down on any of these, but I'm pretty happy with what I've got going now...don't want to upset the apple cart here. Best I've felt since I was a kid, it's about time.  I hope it lasts!"

It was prescribed for me initially by a pill pushing shrink who made a snap judgement that I was bipolar II after my wife filed for divorce and I asked for help.  I had been on and off anti-depressants for years, usually after failed relationships.  It made things worse, not better, and I ended up in and out of the psych ward six times over the next three years, and each time they increased the dose, finally to  a staggering 900 mg per day, also prescribing high doses of Lamictal, Abilify, Effexor and Clonazepam, at  which point I became a zombie and was unable to function for nearly two years.  I also gained the standard 80 lbs.  I'm my experience this drug and the others represent all that is wrong with ""modern"" psychiatry; blindly throwing questionable meds at the problem without an understanding of the underlying brain chemistry.  My salvation from this nightmare came when I got fed up and started seeing a psychiatrist who had the reputation as being one of the best in the business in a large West Coast city.  She carefully listened to my symptoms, my story, and after a few sessions had me tested for the MTHFR genetic mutation, which occurs in various forms in approximately 10% of the population.  Turns out I had two of the mutations which keep the body from processing folic acid, a common vitamin found in many foods, into L-methylfolate, which is needed to balance the common mood regulators, such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, which I am sure many of you know about if you are on this website.  Her solution was to put me on Deplin, a medicinal food ( not a drug!) and wean me off Seroquel and the other drugs, which she felt were either totally useless or in the case of Seroquel did more harm than good.  Within a month I started feeling much better and after four months I was weaned off all of the meds, completely symptom free  This is my story only, but beware Astra Zeneca and the pill pushing incompetent shrinks."

I worked up to 300mg.  I took the medication at night & it would knock me out for 10 – 12 hours straight.  I gave it a couple months to see if the side effects would lessen.  They didn’t.  So we cut my dosage in half down to 150mg.  I still slept a lot & I could not get moving the next day.  I kept taking the meds thinking things would level out over the next few months.  They didn’t.  The medication did not help my depression at all & on top of that my body felt so drugged.  I was so weak that I could barely take care of every day household chores.  I almost never left my house because I always felt so bad both emotionally & physically.  We cut my dosage down again & a couple months later I still felt horrible.  I WAS A PRISONER IN MY OWN BODY!!  I read that other people gained weight on this medication.  I actually LOST weight.  I have always been thin but while on this medication I started to look like a walking skeleton.  I live alone & I was too weak & tried to even get up to cook.  I was only eating one small meal a day.  It was quite scary watching myself literally withering away.  I finally asked my doctor to get me off Seroquel.  She prescribed Citalopram (generic for Lexapro) and after just two weeks I am starting to feel better & I am eating better also.  I regret wasting almost a year of my life on Seroquel.  I should have gotten off of it sooner.  Live & learn.

I have been on this medication for sevearal years.  Was at 300 mg. daily along with Klonopin, Wellbutrin, Mirapex (for RLS) and Lamictal.  Then Lithium was added and I developed neurological symtoms so severe that at first the neurologist thought it was a stroke. Developed hypothyroidism (as I had before on Lithium). Physical Therapy, use of cane, inability to drive, poor speech, reduced cognitive skills were very scary.  Symptoms in remission after 3 months.  Then bouts of akathesia (made my legs feel like the nerves were on the outside, feel you can't sit or stand, severe restlessnes). Weight gain was horrible, and increased as dosage increased. 40 ponds in the last year. Hungry all the time. I was just taken off of the drug two weeks ago and I cannot believe the change in metabolism.  Yes, I have more difficulty sleeping (switched to Trazadone) and racing thoughts are back, but I am determined to deal with those holistically and with DBT. I cannot live in fear of neurological symptoms. Neuroleptic Toxicity and Extrapyramidal Symptoms are no joke. In my experience, it is not worth taking and never in combination with Lithium.

I felt innebriated and out of focus. I did not feel safe to drive. I had distinct memory loss and my temper was shorter than normal. And the mood swings were not resolved at all. I stopped taking seroquel and switched to Prozac to address the moodswings. My OBGYN is quite sure I was misdiagnosed and suffer from PMDD as opossed to bipolar II. I have been taking Prozac for 2 months and feel like I have my life back. Another note worth mentioning is that I've never had a weight problem, and at age 40 have been 125-132 since age 20. Within a month of taking seroquel I had gained 15 pounds. It was a very strange experience. Be advised that seroquel is a very serious, mind-altering drug. It felt very dangerous and unnecessary for me, but again, perhaps it was due to a misdiagnosis.

I didn't even think the drug would be effective until it had built up in my system but perhaps it was because I was very malnourished and weak at the time I began to react within 24 hours.  It started a manic episode that literally had me smashing my head against the wall at work.  One co-worker found me lying unresponsive on the couch and thought I was dead, really I was just out-of-my-mind with panic, rage, and silent screams only I could hear.  I decided to take myself off it after that, as rogue librarians are frowned upon.  However, and I don't have any proof that this was a side effect of Seroquel and I'm sure people would argue with me but, for eight months afterwards and very seldom, to a far lesser extend, now I experienced pain in my shoulders and spine as if my skeleton were attempting to escape my body through the base of my neck.  I've eliminated all other culprits and those few days of Seroquel were when the pain began.  'Pain' does not even begin to describe what that felt like though. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially those recovering from illness.

Also, my Husband lost his job recently, so we no longer have medical insurance..when i went to fill my prescription I was informed the cast would be about $800.

It knocked me out and took a while to adjust to. I suppose it has helped with my mania (I seem to only have them when I drink-- not a good idea). Overall I am able to focus, process, and make responsible decisions now. The draw back is the weight gain- which just in the last six months has become noticeable and embarrassing. That alone makes me dislike my self image- but who wouldn't. The worst part for me is knowing that I can never come off of this drug because I ran out several months ago and experienced awful withdrawals. I was so sick and my insides hurt. I felt like I was dying. I never want to experience that again ever. It was terrible. As long as I take the drug daily and do not drink I am fine. I'll have to do something about this 20+ pounds on my tiny frame though. My clothes don't fit! Just do everything you can to not go through the withdrawals. And consider this a warning- you might get stuck taking this forever. Bonus- AZ&Me has patient plans and financial assistance to those who qualify.

One pill per day at bedtime because it also makes me sleep like a baby. I had a lot of problems sleeping and it sometimes took hours for me to fall asleep.

Over a short amount of time the sleeping evened out and I slept the normal 7-8 hours a night. But VERY deeply!! Hope my house doesn't catch on fire because I doubt I would wake up.

The SSRI had bad side effects, and I stopped taking. I have tried several different SSRI Anti-Depressants during this 10 year span. Approx. 3 years ago I ended up in a Mental Health Facility, and while in there I saw a psychiatrist. After an assessment the Doctor again diagnosed me as Bi-polar with an added diagnosis of Severe Anxiety w/Panic Attacks, and again tried another SSRI that was fairly new to me at the time called Celexa. I took it for about a month or so until the same side effects I have always had with SSRIs began. So I went to my new doctor and explained this to him. He then prescribed me Seroquel to try as an alternative to an SSRI, at first at a low dosage, than higher as I needed it. Not only did it NOT cause the same unwanted side effects as the SSRIs did, it eased my conditions very well and proved to be extremely effective. It has successfully countered my Bi-Polar Disorder for the last 3 or so years. It also aides with the Severe Anxiety & Panic Attacks (along with Clonazepam). Lastly, I have also been diagnosed as an Insomniac and again Seroquel alone has also conquered that diagnosis as well. All in all, while this medicine is expensive due to the lack of generics (patent hasn't expired) it is well worth the money as I have had multiple disabling problems managed with the use of this one drug. The price of the medication can be adjusted with insurance, and/or a financial plan with the Drug Company themselves who offer RX Discounts, and free medication to those who are in need. The only bad side effects I have experienced with this medication is occasional nightmares, and dry mouth in the morning. I hope this helps anyone thinking of taking this medication. For my situation it was a PERFECT solution, and it may be the answer for you as well. Always talk to your doctor and weigh the pros and cons.

154$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/29/2011 4:56:49 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$4$Seroquel was expensive and no fun at all.  After taking my dose, I would be in between sleep and wakefulness.  I would not be able to sleep, but would be very drowsy and yet restless.  It was a very uncomfortable feeling.  I would lie down and not be able to get comfortable.  The uncomfortable feeling occurred whether I took Seroquel in the morning or at night.  I kept taking it anyway.  I can't say how much it helped and how much was the natural course of my bipolar disorder.  But I would not take it again if I had the choice (and fortunately nobody's asking me to.)  Maybe it will work for you, but not for me.  I haven't taken it in years.  Now I'm on a generic version of Lamictal and a generic version of Risperdal.  Risperdal used to have a similar effect on me, but it doesn't anymore.  Maybe it was my drinking that caused the unpleasant side effects.  Who knows why these drugs work this way?  I sure don't.  But I'm much better without drinking.  I recommend it (quitting drinking).

It did help with my anxiety and depression and with sleeping problems. Its much safer than benzo's, and my body became used to the feeling (I know some antipsychotics make you so sick but this one didnt). One thing though, if you are taking a high dose, it can be scarey waking up the first few times and going about your day. The first night I took it I felt like I had been anesthetized and waking up, I had to really lay down for awhile (try not to fall back asleep), be careful when I got up and walked around, and when I did get up, I ended up having to lay down on the floor before passing out. But if you give this medication time, it can work for you (I know diff meds work for diff people), so just give it about 1-3 months if you can handle it. It does get better/ easier and side effects usually dissapear.

It left me feeling very ""slow"", uninspired (I am an artist and this has been difficult for me).  It immediately relieved the mania, but not the depression; that took quite a bit longer (about six months).  Other strictly anti-depressents were much faster acting relative to depression.  It (the Seroquel) also gave me nausea and a sense of apartness from others.  Maybe that was good, given how difficult a time I was having coping with others in that period,a nd that I had recently been extremely traumatized by an abusive relationship w/a former partner.  I don't think I would recommend this drug for everyone.  I think there are others that may do as well and that the pharmaceutical that manufactures/distributes it allows me to obtain the drug free-of-charge is part of why I THINK it may have been given me, rather than something else.  I don't know.  Prozac and its family caused greater mania (and anger) and, at the end of the day, when I am not exercising and getting enough rest, all my symptoms reappear anyway."

Of course just like any medication it has side effects, however I have found the Positives to outweigh the negatives. Just watch your eating at night time and always set your clock for some extra snooze time. Also you should monitor sugar levels with this medication. But I totaly back this medication 100%!!!!!

Since starting I no longer have suicidal thoughts which used to be a daily thing for me. My anxiety has decreased and I finally am able to go out by myself. I used to be so nervous aboout being alone and what people were thinking when they saw me. Nothing else has been anywhere near as effective as Seroquel. My only complaint is that I take 300 mg XR at bedtime which my doctor instructed me to take at 7pm so I will be able to sleep and get drowsy around 10. I don't like having to predict when I will want to go to sleep. overall its a great drug.

You have to actually try for more than a week. I take Seroquel XR and haven't seen any reviews for that yet. It is only my second night taking it and I can feel myself stabilizing for the first time in years! Yet the over sleeping sucks but being bipolar mixed, I'm used to it! So you just have to accept it and work on yourself! And also weight gain is a big thing with depression too! So really if you get your butt up and be active I am sure you can conquer that, Plus everyone is different. My experience so far is dry mouth and oversleeping. I would love to hear from those around 18-30 in my range that are on XR. I am working my way day by day to 300 mg. So far on 100. God Bless"

At first I saw double and slept like the dead. I would bump into walls after taking it, so I took it right before I went to bed and had no difficulty. I had somewhat of a hangover in the mornings, but that went away after 10 - 15 minutes of being up and about. But I felt better in a few days, better still in a couple of weeks. After a week or two, I adjusted to it and felt no side effects except a little morning hangover. Small price to pay for sanity. This can be a great med for many people. I'm bipolar II, rapid cycling with 3 suicide attempts. It was like magic for me. Ride out the initial side effects.

I was perscribed many different drugs, but this is the ONLY one that works for me.  No more suicide attempts and my moods are much more stable.  It does have some side effects but if you can learn how to work with them, they aren't an issue.  I've never ever been able to sleep at night, but an hour after taking Seroquel, I'm out.  I love it.  It did cause me to gain 30lbs, but once I fought through the cravings, I was fine.  Lost all the extra weight and my diet is back to normal.  Since I take it at night and it knocks me out, I know I need to get at least six hours of sleep or I get the ""hangover"" effect in the morning.  The only thing I don't like about it is that I get ripped from my sleep at least once a night.  Nightmares, but the racing heart is a little scary.  It goes away within a minute or so of me waking.  Then I'm back to sleep without any problems.  I don't mind the nightmares.  It's better then spending weeks at a time in Psychiatric care.  So yeah, I love it.  "

My doctor gradually increased my dose to 800mg as it didn't seem to be helping.  Shortly after beginning this medication, I started having severe panic attacks after taking my dose at bedtime.  They were so disturbing that I decreased my dose and then stopped taking it altogether.  At night my heart rate would increase, and I would feel like I was being dragged into a deep, dark coma against my will.  Sometimes I experienced mild hallucinations, which were frightening.  I will say that in general Seroquel did ""take the edge off"" of my emotional episodes, but the improvement was negligible and not worth the side effects.  "

244$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/3/2010 7:08:02 AM$Reviewer: Riga, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$4$Seroquel worked wonders once when I was experiencing a consistent feeling of unreality for days. The very next day I began to feel at home in the world, not anxious or depressed.  However, as soon as the drug started to take effect (I took it at night), I would be so dizzy I couldn't walk without holding on to furniture.  I would fall asleep anywhere--on the floor of the closet while looking for something in a box, on the floor on my exercise mat, standing up in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee.  I'd wake up when the coffee spilled or I started to fall (if I was standing up), but I had a horrible experience waking up on the floor of the closet covered in clothing that had fallen on top of me, not being able to remember where I might be--it was pitch black, I was covered in something--was I in hell?  I didn't think I was dead but I was terrified until I crawled out of the closet and realized I was in my bedroom.  My husband would find me sleeping on the floor all over the house.  So, I went down on the dose. Still had side effects (less though)and it didn't work as a sleeping pill for me. Right now I'm trying not to take it until I need it again.  It is a VERY effective drug but side effects are surreal.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started on Seroquel.  Within a week I felt like a different person, constantly in a fog.  And good god, the sleeping...I slept CONSTANTLY.  When I took the first dose, I got up once to use the bathroom, and other than that slept for 30 something hours.  I gave it time for the side effects to wear down and continuously slept for at least 14-16 hours a day until I stopped taking the medication.  Also, I gained over 40 pounds in 4 months while I took it.  I felt hungry constantly.  It helped with my depression and bipolar at first, but after a month or so, what good effects it had wore down.  Before taking this I could've been considered a nymphomaniac (an effect of bipolar, I know), but this medication made me lose ALL interest in sex.  And this has become a long-term problem.

Also, DO NOT GO OFF THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT TAPERING OFF WITH HELP FROM YOUR DOCTOR.  I could no longer afford it, so instead of paying attention and tapering off of it, I just stopped.  I was sick for days.  Felt horrible mentally and threw up constantly.  

This medication may help some but it was absolutely horrible for me.  If you have issues with it, talk to your doctor instead of thinking the effects will go away.  "

It made me extremely tired at first, but that faded after the first two weeks.  The dreams I experience on this med are amazing.  Very vivid and detailed.

Like others here have mentioned, it makes me crave sweets like there is no tomorrow.  I gained 8 pounds the first month, then realized what was happening and stopped giving into the cravings.

Overall, Seroquel is my own personal miracle drug.  I've seen several people mention that Seroquel has abuse potential.  The only recreational value I can imagine would be to use it as a sleep aid.  "

My memory seems to be permanently changed.  I cannot remember as well as I used to before taking this drug.

Physicians are prescribing it to large numbers of patients now.  I think there will be a large population of people who are less intelligent than they were prior to taking the drug.

Also, there is no cure for hypotension.  So, if you get it like I did, you are just plain screwed.  Spend time considering these side effects.  I think they may be permanent.

I did have a hard time being alert on it. My dose gradually increased over time and added lamictal to it. I was taking 200mg  in the morning 200 in the afternoon and 400 at bed time. This medication worked very well however the side effects were not worth it all it made me gain weight but the problem came when I had my blood drawn and we were able to see what was going on inside  this medication raised my cholesterol messed up my sugar and my thyroid. The only good news I have after being off it for a year everything is almost back to normal. If you are taking this medication you should have blood work done on a regular basis

After a 2wk hospitalization I got on Seroquel and am very very happy to be off effexor. Been on 50mg nightly for 1yr now. It helps me sleep...which was a very big problem...however, I have gained 25lbs. I thought the munchies were due to quitting smoking. But, now that I have read many reviews here I am convinced it is the medication. I would love to be off of it but cannot go without good nights sleep...I will loose it! I have been agitated lately and figured it was again because I quit smoking..but I am rethinking that..maybe it is the medication???

Would go 80-120 days between cycles. Just read Seroquel can increase Prolactin levels, causing problems with missed/irregular periods AND difficulty getting pregnant. Would have been great to know BEFORE taking this as a 24 year old who wants to have kids. 
Also had other side effects which made it not worth it. Extreme fatigue in the mornings, cognitive blunting (i.e. felt like I was in early Alzheimers) never realized I don't have a horrible memory until after I stopped the medicine 3 years into it. Now my memory is completely normal!

I was on 400mg/day for just over 2 years, and was also taking 300mg/day of Lamictal.  At first the Seroquel was beneficial, but after a while the side effects began to greatly outweigh the positives.  It was great for putting me to sleep, and though I didn't have too much trouble waking up, I did have problems feeling awake for most of the day.  It also gave me double vision for a couple of hours mid-morning, which obviously made all activities difficult/dangerous.  I also experienced auditory hallucinations, though not intense or alarming.  I truly only noticed them once they were absent after stopping the medication.  The withdrawl was horrible.  I was constantly sick to my stomach, could barely eat, and vomited for over a month.  However, it was worth it!  I still experience mild hypomanic episodes, but not as serious previous to the Seroquel.  I still remain on the Lamictal and it has been a savior.

This past summer, my doctor added seroquel in addition to the zoloft. We began at 50mg. At first, it seemed to be helping. It did make me very drowsy about an hour after taking it. If I tried to fight it and stay awake, it felt like I was drunk.  Then my moods seemed to get worse.  The doctor gradually increased the dose to 300mg.  In the past 3 months, I have gained almost 30lbs.  Prior to the medication, I was hardly hungry.  Now it seems like I can't get full.  Also began cutting myself when extremely stressed.  Not sure if this was from the seroquel since I don't have a history of cutting.  I found it very difficult to wake in the morning.  I have a 19 month old child and I never hear him cry in the mornings.  It's a good thing my husband is home to hear him. Having a young family, this drug was very difficult to use.  Having to take it pretty much as soon as I got home, to make sure that I would get enough sleep to hear the alarm in the morning.  I needed to have at least 12 hours of sleep.  It's just not possible to spend time with my husband and take care of my child on this medication.  
At this point, my doctor is gradually decreasing the dose and we are going to try ambilify (I think that is how to spell it).  Hopefully, it will work better for me.     "

Period. I was on this drug for a little less than a year, and in that time, I literally could not function. Then, one day, I ended up checking myself in to a pshyciatric ward,  because of the side effects of this medicine. All at once, I could not swallow, followed by severe confusion, muscle rigidness, and psychosis. I WAS TERRIFIED to say the least. I spent two days there and was taken off the drug. After a few weeks, I started to come around and feel halfway normal again. I feel sorry for anyone who is taking this obviously harmful medication, and the fact that this product is still on the market and people are taking it, bothers me. Hope this helps someone out there.

I gained 30 lbs in no time and it was more like water weight because it was more like my whole body was swollen from my face all the way down to my feet....I had no energy at all it was hard to even get up and down out of a chair. I had chest pains constantly,dry mouth and the shakes... I could go on and on because I felt like it was literally killing me !!!! I took myself off of it because I called my Dr and she advised me to stay on it even after I told her about all the side affects I was having and there was noway I was going to do that I know my BODY and I knew I was not feeling right. After going off of it my insomnia is back but I am able to live life again and the weight dropped off without me even having to diet.... I really hope this helps anyone that is thinking about taking this medication. I would never had takin it if I would have known what it was going to do to me... I now just take something to help me sleep from my primary care Dr and that is it because I don't trust in any kind of drug that is supposed to help you but instead it henderd my life more than anyone could ever imagine !!!!!!!
341$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/18/2009 1:46:11 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$"I had a horrible reaction to this drug! I was on it for about 3 weeks. When I got up to the 300mg pill, things started going down hill for me. I still don't remember a lot that happened when I was on the med, and I started cutting again when I was on it, sometimes with no memory of cutting myself. I had bruses from bumping into things all the time, and it was basically like being drunk and high constantly. It was not fun. The first night I took the 300mg pill I wet the bed cause I was so knocked out I couldn't wake up to go to the bathroom. 

I went to the doctors because I had slight whiplash from going to an amusement park (while on the med) and not being able to control my head on the roller coasters. When I was in the room my speach was slirred and when I was walking to the waiting room I had to be guided out, and I've been going to this place for years and could probably draw map of it from memory. The PA, nurse, a woman from the front desk who has known me since I was a baby, and my case worker all stopped me before going in the waiting room and told me that I needed to be off this med, because of the effect it was having on me. A different doctor perscribed it for me, and the PA called him and told him I was to taper off Seroquel right away. Getting off the med probably saved my life."

343$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/9/2009 4:21:21 PM$Reviewer: workinggirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on some form of antidepressent since 1987. Despite medication, my illness grew from mild depression to a total inability to function in the '00s. Nothing worked until I was put on Seroquel. Like magic, the negative loop that ran and ran in my mind stopped. Yes, I've gained weight (it does seem to trigger late nite eating) and the restless legs sometimes drive me crazy, but I can function again. I even got a job and have been able to keep it! If this had not worked, my doctor was recommending electric shock therapy, so believe me, I am thrilled.  Having taken so many meds over the years, I am convinced that each individuals brain chemistry or whatever you want to call it is as unique as his or her DNA.  What works for me may not work for you.  Side effects that I can tolerate; you may not be able to stand.  But until my doctor tried Seroquel, I was hopeless.  The only thing that kept me from committing suicide was my dogs and not wanting to leave a mess for my family to clean up, either literally or figuratively. Oh, it is also expensive as hell, but I'd pay for it even if I didn't have insurance.  Hopefully, it will become a generic some day soon. Finally, it does make you sleep and sleep and sleep.  I've just had to adjust my life so I can allow 9-10 hours a day for sleep. It is worth it to me.

At first(on 50mg) it really helped alot with sleep. I slept throughout the night every night. But had problems waking up and feeling very groggy. After about a month my mind and body were used to it, and now at the max. dose 300mg, I still sleep well, but its almost like an all day, all night hypnotic(meaning I dont feel the need for my anxiety meds throughout the day UNLESS something really stressful arises. Its not very addictive at all, but If you go two or three days without it.. you do feel like your gonna lose it and need it.. not out of withdrawl, but because it works so dang good your mind begins to trip. It takes care of anxiety;stress;insomnia;lossof appetite;and depression. 5 in 1 drug!

Is it Bipolar depression or major depression?  Big differences in the two.  He suggested this medication because I have failed many trials of anti-depressants.  I have been on this medication for 4 months at 300mg.  The first 2 weeks of taking this medication were a blur.  I remember being in a daze, disoriented, dizzy, and very very tired.  Ok, I gave it a few months.  The verdict, I am not impressed with its powers as a depression fighting drug.  On the other hand, I do suffer from sleep apnea and insomnia and it actually helps me fall asleep.  I take it 2 hour before bedtime, and by bedtime I am about to fall over, boy does it make you sedated, but I am no longer tossing and turning for hours before finally falling asleep.  It takes me about 15 to 20 minutes and I am out!  A good sedative for sleeping but not so much a good mood-stabilizer/anti-depressant.

363$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/11/2009 3:50:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$I've tried a lot of antidepressants over the past few years. All the drugs I've tried either didn't work or worked for a bit before they stopped working. Last week, I went to my doctor to follow-up on the Pristiq I've been taking. I told her that some days it seems to help, but other days it seems like I haven't been taking anything.  I also told her that a month or so ago, I was feeling good so I stopped taking it for about 2 weeks and felt great before I crashed. She said it could be that the drug worked its way out of my system, or it could be that I may be bipolar.  I told her that my therapist has had me tracking my moods, and she thinks I may be hypomanic.  My doctor said most people call the doctor when they are feeling down and think they're depressed, so a lot of the time, bipolar disorder gets overlooked.  She had me fill out a questionnaire, and the results showed borderline bipolar disorder. She suggested trying Seroquel. She gave me a starter pack which starts at 50mg on the first day, increases to 100mg on the second day, and goes up to 200mg on the third day.  My doctor said to take the Seroquel at night because it WILL make me drowsy.  I took my first dose (50mg) on Saturday night and woke up on Sunday in a major daze. My husband kept asking me if I was ok. By late afternoon/early evening, I wasn't in a daze anymore. I took my second dose that night (100mg) and woke up on Monday morning again in a daze. I took the morning off work because I was afraid to drive. It almost felt like I had been drinking. That night I took the third dose (200mg). I woke up today feeling very dazed, although I'm coming out of it now around 3:30. I stayed home from work today and called my doctor to see if this was a normal side effect and to ask whether it'll go away. They called me back and said the doctor is calling in a rx for Abilify instead. I hope that helps. The Seroquel has helped with my racing thoughts, but I don't think the daze I've been in is worth it.

It works really well but it does have many side effects. I gained 50 pounds and I now have Type 2 diabetes. I have to be on Seroquel regardless of the side effects. I cannot sleep without it and I am a basket case if I do not sleep. Seroquel is extremely expensive if you do not have insurance. It costs around $750 for 60 pills a month without insurance. And please if you take Seroquel at night, don't get out of the bed because it will make your heart race, which can be scary. I take them only at night and when you get used to Seroquel it gets easier to function. 
Now, if you start to eat more than usual try stopping by taking a appetite suppressant or try to beat the cravings by eating vegetables. Otherwise, I can't function without Seroquel.

383$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/1/2009 7:57:25 PM$Reviewer: Rachelle S., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I take a very small dose of Seroquel XR - just 50 mgs - a few hours before bedtime to help with sleep.  I was told this formula (the Seroquel XR) reaches peak levels approx. 4 hours after taking it and have found this to be fairly accurate.  A very important reason that my doctor has me on this drug in addition to Trazodone for slee is it also helps minimize my anxiety and mixed episodes, which is a very good thing!  I was on a higher dose (200 mgs) but found it caused me too much fatigue during the day.  I have had some weight gain with this drug, but that was primarily when I took more, not on this smaller dose.  (The weight gain could also be related to the combination of drugs I take: Depakote XR, Trazodone, Pristiq, Abilify, Klonopin, and Seroquel; so I can't just pin-point it as the Seroquel.)  I did notice that when I first started taking Seroquel it had much more of ""an impact"" at sedating me then it does now.  The smallest dose could tire me out within about half and hour.  This effect has worn out though now.  Overall, I would say Seroquel is a very effective drug for me.  I know several others that take it (for varying reasons and with varying effects on their energy level) so I will say it's very important with this drug - like all prescriptions - to really find out how it will affect your sleep and energy and why it's being prescribed at the particular dose it is being prescribed.

I was put on this and depocote.  I could not stay awake at work.  I was a zombie all of the time.  Went to Abilify, Geodon and only this but 300 mg.  All of these made it impossible to function.   I am now on lithium and ciatopram and do very well on it.  They are generic and cost $4.00 each a month.  Can't do $50.00 a month just for the seroquel.

I had terrible side effects. First i gained 40pds. Then i was a zombie the next day and i am a 32 yr old woman with three children. It also raised my triglycerides alot. Normal is under 150 and mine was 609. High triglycerides can cause damage to your pancreatitis and can kill you. I am having a hard time remembering things and i have problems getting my sentences straight. But the worest of it all is i was diagnost with Tardive Dyskinsia which is terrible i now have movements with my mouth and tongue that i can't control. If you look up the side effects on this drug they say its suposely rare to get Tardive Dyskinsia well i guess i was that one in a millon. This drug is terrible i don't reccomend seroquel to anyone. Now on top of taking my normal biplor meds i have to take Niacin for my Triglycerides and 200 iu of vitamin e complex to help control Tardive dyskinsia. My dr told me that Tardive Dyskinsia is sometimes irriversable. Which means i will probaly have to live with it. I would not reccomend seroquel to my worest enemy. Now my dr has slowly taken me off the Serquel and put me on Geodon. Wonderful drug it gives me lots of get up and go and a different out look on life. It opens up your eyes. The only side effect with Geodon is at first its kinda like Seroquel when you get up in the morning its hard to get up an go but my dr gave me Adderall 10mg to take in the morning and i now have know problems. So to all you people out there with Bipolar with panic attacks and aniety DONT TAKE SEROQUEL IT HAS RUINED MY LIFE!!!!

First off it works really, really well for mood stabilization, and if you have insomnia it works really well for that.

IMO, it is the second best, with Zyprexa being the first.

However, here are the problems.  Sleepiness all the time -though not near as bad Zyprexa.

Constant, constant, constant hunger.  Over about four years of taking atypical anti-psychotics.  I went from 190 lbs to 270 lbs.

My doctor took me off of it and put me on Lamictil.  Almost, immediately, I started shedding the pounds.  I take other drugs that suppress appetite, but I will say without a doubt that the Seroquel just simply made me way too hungry, and too fat.

Look if Lamictil did not exist, it is either taking the Seroquel or having to deal with major depression and dizzying highs.  I would opt to take Seroquel."

I have gained more and more weight, putting on about 38 pounds since I started. Also, it makes me sleep wayyyy too much.  I take it before I go to bed and if I don't get 12-13 hours of sleep, I'm still exhausted.  I've missed many college classes and some days of work bc of oversleeping. If I don't take it for even one night, I get no sleep (even less than before I was taking it, which even then wasn't much) and the next day I feel really sick all day (empty feeling in the stomach but if I eat anything I feel nauseous).  Is there a chance of addictive qualities with this drug? It worked reallllly well for me for a couple months, but has slowly worn off and isn't worth the side effects.  I feel sick a lot and am always tired.  Also I've lost nearly all sex drive.  I'm going to my dr to get an alternative.

This med has caused me to gain 15lbs. but I'd rather have a few extra pounds than live the way I used to when I was flipping out and being angry all the time. I used to get crying spells before I took Seroquel, and those are gone too. I also talk to people more freely and a lot of my social phobia has gone away. I feel like this medication saved my life by making me comfortable in my own skin and helping get rid of all the unnecessary rage.

When I was 15 I attempted suicide for the first time, I was sent to a mental facility where they diagnosed me for Bipolar and put me on Seroquel and Lithium. I gained a lot of weight off from the Seroquel, and it messed with my head a lot. After I took it I felt extremely lethargic and sleepy. I didn't sleep well, I'd often scream in my sleep and wake myself and everyone around me. The drug made me more confused than anything else, I didn't feel as sad as I did before, but I also couldn't feel happy (unless I was over tired from taking it), it was like I was numb. Nine months later I had a second suicide attempt, I was sent to a different mental health hospital and they replaced my medications with Lexapro, Wellbutrin and Topamax (mostly to help my weight situation). I just got off all my medications last spring, so it's been almost a year now that I've been medication and therapy free. Althought Seroquel can actually treat people, I don't really recommend it for most.

Although it did help with the bi polar, it has some nasty side effects.  I gained over 50 lbs and developed type 2 diabetic.  I was taken off of the medication when I went to a new dr and have since lost the weight and the type 2 problems are gone. The drug mfg is being sued for not disclosing the whole truth about the side effects.  I'm one of the people suing them.
442$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/3/2009 10:48:44 AM$Reviewer: EleniH, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$4$3$I am bipolar I treatment resistant, with mixed states. This drug has stabilzed me for the most part, but I have had episodes and  another hospitalization while on the drug. It is not a wonder pill for me, but it definitely has helped my particular situation. I take 1000 mg a day, 150 am, 150 noon and 700 pm.  I have gained a lot of weight, 50 lbs, over 2 years.  I am trying to lose weight through diet and exercise with minimal loss (1 pound in 1 month of hard exercise and following weight watcher's diligently)  I find the exhaustion I initially experienced went away, but is now back again.  And, I am hungry all the time.  With seroquel you need to go to bed early or you will be a tired wreck the next day.

This is an extremely POWERFUL medication and unless you have a SEVERE mood disorder, it's over the top! I took only 1/2 the initial dose as prescribed (as recommended by my pharmacist) and I was groggy for 2 days straight -- felt like I was drunk. I have heard the mfr is being sued for not disclosing it causes diabetes and weight gain. Scary drug unless you have a severe problem in my opinion.

My Dr at the time put me on 200mg a day, and even though I wasn't feeling better, he kept it at that.  In the long run, he ended up up being a terrible Dr, so of course I switched.  My current Dr is awesome, and has me on Seroquel, Klonopin, and Lamictal.  I ended up spending a week in a psychiatric unit with severe anxiety and panic, about 6 months ago, before I was on my current treatment regimen.  After all of that, and during my stay in the hospital, my final dosage is at 600mg per day (50mg morning, 50mg afternoon, 500mg bedtime).  It has worked very well for me, both with my anxiety and my moods.  I haven't had a bipolar cycle in a long time, so in my opinion, Seroquel is an all-around wonder drug! :)

So this med would be great if you want to be a zombie for a month. At least while your awake. And then there's the whole can cause Diabetes thing. The only thing this drug should be used for is to treat manic episodes that can not be controlled or possibly dealt with by other means. Try sleeping pills when your manic and have been awake for 20 hrs. Strict sleeping schedules are a must for all mental health.

This medication has not helped me at all with any of my issues, in fact, it has made me feel like a zombie throughout the entire day.  I also find that it makes me extremely sleepy so I am not sure why she has prescribed this medication twice a day.  I’ve spoken to her numerous times about this issue because it is affecting me staying awake at my job which is not a great thing.  I’ve also been experiencing extreme abdominal pain to the point where I could hardly stand up straight.  At first I thought it was gas which causes bloating and pressure but then I found out it was because of this medication.

I honestly don’t recommend this to anyone due to the ineffectiveness of the product and because it will make you feel like a zombie for at least 99% of your day.  Before I took this medication I actually felt better so I am now at the point of lowering my own dose by cutting my pills in half each day and eventually I will stop taking this medication and seek out a naturopathic or holistic route.

I feel that doctors today will prescribe medications to patients without being totally honest about what other products are out there, so we must do our own research.  I have come to the conclusion that doing your own research and finding a doctor who wholeheartedly cares about your well being and is interested and/or willing to try alternatives before giving meds that will make your life “less productive” can make the difference in solving the problem or having a medical condition that can affect you for the rest of your life.

I have been on several medications to help my condition but I think seroquel has helped me the most. It helps me sleep (which is sooo important). It also helps my mood tremendously in that I don't think about how I'm feeling- I just feel rested and... better. So, if you just started taking this or are thinking about it for depression, anxiety, etc. I say give it a chance. :)

I started at 25mg. That did nothing.  I am now up to 400mg. I do like how it helps stablize my moods. I have depression, and bipolar.  I take the seroquel as a stablizer and Wellbutrin XL for my depression. I have been gaining alot of weight since this last bump up from 300 to 400mg. I gained about 15lbs in the last 3 months. I used to have a horrible time sleeping. This knocks me out like a baby. The downfall is if I take it really late at night and have to get up really early for work or something, I get really sick. Light headed, dizzy, sweating, feeling like I'm going to throw up and even pass out. I moved about 2 hrs from my psychiatrist and she wouldn't give me enough medicine to make it to my next appointment, and wouldn't call it in either, so the withdraw from it is terrible. I get bad migrains, sick to my stomach, dizzy, and just plain mean. I do want to talk to my Dr about maybe coming off of it. I hear alot of people have been gettin diabetes from it, and that runs in my family. I don't want to do anything that would help it along.

Over the years I have taken every med that is out there on the market and some would work for a little while and then stop working. I have had horrible side effects everything from weight gain, body trimmers so bad I could not stop slobbering and hold a cup of coffee, liver damage, high cholesteral, I can't tell you all the side effects that I have had.
I started seeing a new doc and she suggested that we try seroquel and I was at my wits end because I did not want to end up back in the mental hospital I just wanted something that was going to work.  I started taking it and everyone said they could see a difference in me that was for the good I was like my old happy self again.  I have been able to stop taking the anti depesants and the sleeping pills and the anti anxity pills. This drug has made a world of differance for my life I am able to get up and do things, be with my family and friends and I am happy.

The md should really tell patients before prescribing.  I take 300mg a day with 150mg of Wellbutrin.  I was ravenous for anything sweet until I started the wellbutrin. I have gained forty pounds that won't come off for anything.  I work out, eat right and still gain weight.

I would not suggest driving while taking this medication until you are used to it's side effects. I've heard about weight gain associated with this medicine, but have not experianced it thus far.

I don't have the weight gain and it's the best night sleep ever! I have accidentally skipped a dose or two and couldn't sleep for a couple of days (50+hrs). I fall asleep fast and stay put for 9+ hrs. I did have a hard time at first w/waking but now I am learning to take it earlier (which is difficult, I work 2nd shift), and get up earlier.  I tend to stay awake the rest of the day as well.  No tiredness through out the day.  But if I take it and I am not in bed, I do tend to feel a bit ""drunk"". I did my homework a bit before taking.  I knew a lot of people said something about weight gain. So knowing that before hand, I curbed my normal eating habits and changed them into healthier choices.  I have increased my activity level as well.  All in all I have lost 12 lbs.  My moods have leveled.  I am a bit more organized. And I am trying to be a bit more hands on with my kids (ages 16 & 11).  I also picked up a hobby which normally I would never do.  I will write back if I have  down side, or an episode.

MY husband sat up and checked my pulse constantly for HOURS... It finally came down to 110 after 6 hours. NEVER AGAIN!!! I was given 100mg to take but I MUST have 12 hours to devote to sleeping if I take that much.  I get by with 8 hours with taking 50mg. It seriously saved my life, and my marriage... I'm not quite as moody and ""snappy"" because I'm not exhausted."

I had severe aggravation, anxiety, couldn't relax, insomnia, irrated easily, most of the time isolated and couldn't work to boot. I went to a psychiatric nurse practioner and she started putting me on Lamictal and klonapin for sleep. After two times trying Seroquel, the second time was the better. I think the Lamictal had to balance my mood first and my body got used to that way of functioning, more calm. My sleep is much better, can sleep through the night at 50mg at bedtime. I feel so relaxed during the day and more confident I can get through my days. Not inhaling alot to relax. No weight gain yet, but I am excercising regularly and eating right. Please don't give up on medications as Seroquel might be helpful especially with sleep. You,ll know right away with the sleep. I know we are all different and we all need different dosages or meds. but it's nice to know that Seroquel works fast for sleep and in my case three days to see the calmness. I have read so many reviews, and thank you to all who have helped me find Seroquel with yuor inspiring stories.

My doctor told me to do 450mg.  I did that for a couple weeks but then my doctor thought the Seroquel was adding to the anxiousness so he took me off it completely.  That was a huge mistake.  I did not sleep until he put me back on it.  I was also more anxious again.  When he put me back on it mainly for sleep he told me to take 300mg and if that didn't help to take another 300mg.  This drug has helped me in many ways.  It is very sedating so I only take it at night.  I sleep very soundly, too.  My husband will come home from work at midnight and we will have a conversation.

I used to be a trim size four but as a result of the medication and the increase in appetite, I am now a size ten. Though it does help me sleep, it sometimes make me feel dizzy and nauseaus. If I happen to get up in the middle of the night, I bump into things. Recently while getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, I hit my head,but I was so groggy I didn't realize I had hurt myself. 

My vision has blurred, I sometimes get pain in my body when I'm sleeping and I wake up in the morning feeling sluggish and drugged. On some days I have such a hard time shaking the fogginess off that I am completely withdrawn.
Additonally it has made me severely constipated.
 Also with the weight gain, I'm extremely concerned about becoming diabetic. My mother was bi-polar too and she became diabetic from her medication-a year after acquiring diabetes she passed away. It's extremely frusterating to have to choose between your mental health and your physical well being. I'm sure that seraquel works fine for some, but it is not a medication I would recommend."

I've had one panic attack in two weeks, two ""manic"" episodes in a month lasting less than a day each, and my depressive days have been cut dramatically! If you're looking for a miricle drug, there isn't one. This isn't for everyone. It can't work for everyone-- nothing can. It sucks, get over it. But I'd recommend trying it to any one with bipolar or PTSD with the caution to take a week off and adjust fully to the new med.

I would sleep all night and not be able to wake up in the morning. When I eventually did wake up, I barely made it to the shower and did fall numerous times. I was unable to drive, go to work, and function to do anything that I would normally do. Not everyone is the same, but that is my experience. It was rather scary. I did ween off the medication and it was the best thing I have ever done. Just a side note- Apparently there are some suspicions about seroquel being linked to Diabetes, I would talk to your doctor since everyone is different.

623$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/16/2008 8:34:05 AM$Reviewer: $2$1$5$"Takes all emotion away. You feel like a walking zombie. But most of the medications for bipolar do that so it is hard to tell if it is the medication or just you. 
Also makes you gain a great amount of weight and none of the doctors will admit it is the Seroquel doing it. 
You will sleep walk and just pass out in random places. Talk and scream in your sleep.
In general -- HORRIBLE DRUG! Should be taken off the market!!!!"

I suggest you research this side effect, as I have also had it with Compazine.  If you have this side effect with Seroquel you may also have it with certain other tranquilizers. It's a rare but very serious side effect...research all your meds if you have this side effect!  PS I was on this medicine for two weeks with these severe side effects before my doctor would take me off this Seroquel.  It took my husband to tell him I was in severe pain before he believed me.  Why are Bipolar people dismissed so easily?
