1$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/26/2019 11:54:19 PM$Reviewer: KT, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$3$When I was initially prescribed it, I was directed to take a half (100 mg) table the first day, then a full one the second day, and increase by one each day until 300 mg. I barely made it to 300 mg. I guess you cant be bipolar if you're in a coma! I had weird dreams and slept 12  hours. When I was awake, I ate everything in sight. I had difficulties driving to work because I was extremely exhausted and veered a little of the road. I stopped taking it when I almost wrecked. I will try any medication, but this one, again.

That last for 10-15 minutes and then I would get so dizzy I'd about fall over. Next my eyes will only want to roll into the back of my head and shake back and forth and I feel really stupid. Then I sleep for 5 hours and wake up not really remembering most of the day even though I went through it. But I didn't have the consciousness to be upset or disturbed?

In those five years I have stopped cleaning my house, stopped walking, stopped doing my art, stopped going out it's a chore just to go to the doctor.  All I want to do is sleep or watch T.V.  I have no life left since I started taking Seroquel. I am lazy, lazy, lazy!  Not to mention that I've gained 75 pounds on this awful med. because it makes you crave sweets and all carbs like crazy! I heard this drug is extremely difficult to get off from.

Eventually a sedative dose of seroquel around 125-150 mg worked very well for calming down anxiety intrusive thoughts and allowing me to sleep. It is ridiculous that some of the doctors who aggressively medicate arenÃ¢Â?Â?t cautious because the right dose of helpful medication can be life saving while a bad approach can cause instability that caused serious problems in my life then unfortunately psychiatrist often blame your condition over their inappropriate treatment so itÃ¢Â?Â?s important to be aware of whatÃ¢Â?Â?s going on with you.

12$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/28/2019 6:44:04 PM$Reviewer: Bluntlady, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed 100mg seroquel by my psychiatrist about a month ago. Make sure you read all possible side effects because there are a lot and some are pretty serious! I cut my dose in half to 50mg because 100mg was way too strong. I have to take it no later than 11pm or i am exhausted the whole next day. So far I have had no side effects from the drug. I take it in combination with Lamictal 300mg and lexapro 20mg in the morning and xanax as needed. This medication has worked great for me. It helps me sleep well and I am noticably more calm. I haven't had to take my xanax nearly as much. It has lowered my anxiety and i have had no severe mood swings or huge breakdowns since i have started it. I have had no weight gain or change in appetite. It is important you have blood work done regularly as it can change cholesterol levels and white blood cell count.
13$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$3/24/2019 5:13:24 PM$Reviewer: Kook81, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on about 6 different antidepressants since I was sixteen. My Dad went blind when I was 12 and sadly it chandge my life for the worse. The happy go lucky kid was was wrong and at 12 you are super comfused as to why you are feeling this way, I didnâ??t start taking anything till 16 and have tried so many different ones I had almost given up hope. The only one that sort of helped was Cymbslta. My Doctor added Seroquel to my cymbalta and it is a total game changer. Iâ??m 24 and finally have found the right thing to me. The only side effect Iâ??ve had is being constantly been hungry. But I think I can muster enough will power to combat that. Seroquel works great for me but someone else it might not. Everyone processes meds differently and unfortunately there isnâ??t one drug that helps all. But if youâ??re like I was and felt completely defeated I say give Seroquel a chance. Itâ??s been 8 years and Iâ??ve found something that truly helps.

15$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$2/27/2019 8:54:41 AM$Reviewer: mischka, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$1$5$I began taking this drug in May 2002. I took 800mg at bed time for about 5 years. I've gone up and down between 300mg and 500mg per day for the last 12 years. I am now insulin resistant. My cholesterol levels are off the charts. I have gained at least 40 pounds since I began taking it. I now have to take Actos, Metformin, and Trulicity to combat the insulin resistance. My doctor is weaning me off Seroquel and on to Latuda. I, also, have horrible restless leg syndrome.Please think twice before taking this drug, unless it's your ONLY option. The side effects wreak havoc on your body. It's not worth it if you have any other option.

I'd had surgery for medication resistant epilepsy three months prior, and was prescribed this in anticipation of bouts of depression I was expected to experience in addition to the GAD I'd had since childhood. I don't remember any actual events of those five days, just that I was never fully awake, everything had a dark cloud over it, and I wasn't able to walk. Luckily, I was able to use two weeks' vacation time while I was in the hospital, then recovering at home.

My doctor prescribed this medication to help me go to sleep. Instead of making me sleepy, it gave me bad severe restless body, which kept me up 4 additional hours. When I did finally fall asleep, I had one if the most severe vivid dreams of my life. I woke up in hysterics and it took a while for me to settle down. Im sure its an excellent medication for most. This is just my experience with it.
22$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$6/27/2018 7:47:13 PM$Reviewer: Blitzer, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been taking different medications for treating many brain disorders for over five years. I had a cocktail that I took every night. My doctor and I decided to try to see if I could get off of some of the medications that I was being treated for Bipolar 1 and Mania, PST, ADD, Insomnia. So, I tried this medication. I loved it, but yes it has side effects. Restlessness in the legs, groggy in the morning then it would go away. My weight did go up, but I got the best sleep. My dreams were coming back, my moods swing decreased. I was not agitated or in a rage. It works! I did go off of it because of the weight gain, but after reading so many of these reviews I am going back on. I will have a long chat with my shrink the next time as to how to deal with some of these side effects. I just did my blood work up and it was all good. If I am going to take this medication again then I will need to do a follow-up with blood workups. The restless leg, I was taking gabapentin. It helped with this problem. I would say if you try it you going to have to watch out. Get your blood workup first, watch the side effects, ask your family to get involved to watch you. There is nothing worse than a bipolar rage. It is why there are so many people in jail that have had an episode and didn't know that is what was going on. I diagnosed five years ago. I am now 64. I can't tell you how many failed relationships, lost jobs, losing my home. The only thing that kept me from killing myself is I am a Catholic. Until I was diagnosed, I thought I was an alien that didn't belong on this planet. 
23$Condition: Schizophrenia$5/15/2018 8:46:37 PM$Reviewer: RedFahee, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"Having a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia as well as debilitating manic depression (bipolar disorder) it was hard to function in daily life. 100mg in the morning, then 300mg before bed and I feel like a normal person again. No hallucinations, no voices, and not a bit of paranoia. I can sleep now and actually enjoy life like I NEVER have before. Absolutely amazing. The people that say it doesn't work or say they can't function on it only think they have the illness their doctor says they have. I have taken the same dose for 3 months and it's like nothing I've ever experienced. If you are using it so you can sleep...you are retarded. Period. It is an ANTI-PSYCHOTIC. Which helps people like me, and WILL cause mental problems for normal people. Ive seen it happen to 7 family members. Don't use this for sleep. And if you have trouble waking up of functioning while taking it STOP and switch doctors because you are not ill and you will develop problems. Otherwise, I'm thrilled to finally be ""right"" in the head again. "

27$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/6/2018 12:03:22 PM$Reviewer: Through the Storm, 25-34 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$1$4$I was prescribed Seroquel as a mood stabilizer in addition to my antidepressant and antianxiety medicine.  I had A LOT of weight gain.  I was on Seroquel for about 5.5 years.  Before I took Seroquel I weighed around 155 lbs.  While I was on Seroquel, I maxed out at 242 lbs, which lead to me being prediabetic and having to take Metformin.  Determined to lose weight, I had to see a psychiatrist to get off of Seroquel because my primary care physician did not feel comfortable getting me off Seroquel herself.  After a long wait, the psychiatrist tapered me down.  During the tapering process and after I was off of Seroquel, I experienced SEVERE ITCHING ALL OVER MY BODY that lasted about A MONTH.  The itching was everyday at ra don times throughout the day.  The itching from getting off of Seroquel interfered with my ability to concentrate on work or school.  I found that when I was busy, the itching was less severe.  During down time, I would play video games to distract me from the itching, but that stopped working after a while.  Taking showers intensified the itching.  One time I wrapped myself in cold, wet towels which made the itching less intense.  After about 1 month, the terrible itching stopped.  It got off of a Seroquel in September 2017.  It is now April 2018 and I am happy and blessed to say I no longer itch, and I weigh about 184 lb.  I hope this post helps others struggling with weight gain on Seroquel or itching after getting off of Seroquel.

It makes you lose contact with reality. The fuzziness lasted all day and caused memory loss. I had all of the negative side effects to the power of 10. The severe loss of muscle strength made the dizziness dangerous. I was unable to function and still find it difficult to focus. Why it was prescribed is a mystery. I am changing psychiatrists. Not a go to drug for anyone.

Then I take .25mg xanax at bedtime. This is the lowest prescribed dose of each of these drugs. But that's all I need. It works, every night, without increase in dosage.  This changed my life.

In the beginning it was fantastic. Helped my depression alot. But after a few months it started to change. My memory deteriorated very rapidly. I was always confused and lost slight motor skills, talking proper sentences and hand eye coordination became difficult. I became so scared. I didn't feel pain or happiness. I was completely numb like a robot. Sleeping days at a time. Forgetting shifts at work falling asleep everywhere I sat down. I had to get off I feared it was going to kill me. 
I tapered to 50mg then 25mg over about 2 months. I'm completely off now for about 3-4 weeks. Instantly my memory became clearer. Side effects at the beginning were extreme irratibility, anger and constant migraine. Few weeks later I am now getting severe nausea, worse migraine, extreme anxiety/panic attacks, always so thirsty, insomnia, very sensitive to light and I feel like I'm losing touch with reality. Hard to explain although worst experience of my life. This drug should ONLY be prescribed for extreme life or death cases. Or banned. It's disgusting. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  "

Oh, and I am a man.  I was on Seroquel for years, but I have to admit, I got off of it and vowed never to return.  It was the weight gain.  I can't remember the timetable but over the coarse of months upon starting it I shot up.  By the end I peaked at 200 pounds, and I'm 5'6""!  To be fair, there was another reason that changed my mind about the med, it was the foggy feeling it left.  I just felt dull.  I have to admit, I was on a lion-share of it, totaling 900mg.  I'm guessing at lower doses the foggy feeling might be minimal.  I never made it that far to find out.  So, in short, the weight gain and the foggy feeling were too much for me.  I have since been on a number of other drugs but settled upon Latuda.  Latuda has worked out for me.  No weight problems or fogginess.  Ask your doctor about Latuda. "

But I used it for 2.5 years from ages 15-17. It was horrible, but I was also misdiagnosed with Bipolar. It made me tired, cranky, nauseous and unable to eat for a month at a time, gave me headaches, and made me dizzy. There were plenty of times when I consumed huge amounts of alcohol and pot with Seroquel, which was never a good experience. Don't ever do it! Please. I was originally put on 400 mg and they upped it to 800mg gradually, (when you're first put on the drug, you feel drunk for about a week).I finally had enough and stopped using it cold turkey. I had physical withdrawal for three months - similar to a heroin withdrawal (from what I've read in relation to my symptoms). The drug increased my heart rate astronomically - I was seeing stars quite a bit. It made me crave unhealthy foods which didn't help, and made me gain unhealthy weight. Before you go on this drug, seriously contemplate whether you actually need it. And NEVER mix it with another substance. As a healthcare worker, I would NEVER put a teenager on this drug, unless they had severe schizophrenic symptoms. I started to develop facial twitches after awhile and slurred speech. It took a couple years and major lifestyle changes until all of these effects completely dissipated. The only thing I appreciated about Seroquel was its ability to put me to sleep, and keep me asleep, as I have a hard time staying asleep throughout the night. However, it caused me to have many bouts of sleep paralysis.

It just makes you eat ALL the time and makes u feel hungry. I am definitely upset w/ my overall experience while I was on Seroquel(8 yrs); and I would not recommend this med to anyone. My Dr. switched me to Trazadone and Lamictal in conjunction w/ Depakote to treat my Bi-polar Disorder and this combo really works 4 me. Now, the Seroquel weight is slowly starting 2 finally come off.

I have really low lows and it doesn't take much to get me there, which of course has always caused tons of sleeping issues. I was prescribed 25mg Seroquel in addition to my long established 20mg Prozac. I'm very happy with it for sleeping and as a boost for my antidepressant. In the past, I have tried Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Xanax (for sleep) and (unfortunately) Effexor. For a while, I went up to 50mg Seroquel but I had noticeably disturbing dreams. Based on the reviews I've seen here, I think most people are taking too high of a dose. This is definitely a drug I would start low and see it's effect for a 3-6mo period. I also take Ativan occasionally for anxiety but overall the low level Seroquel has very much improved my condition. I have control of when I go to sleep and I sleep well, waking up feeling like I actually rested. Being sleepy comes quickly and deep within 30 mins of taking it but I think it's appropriate. I have never slept through my kids needing me at night so the depth or need for sleep must taper off.  Having a handle on my emotions and specifically on my sleep has helped me be significantly more functional.  I look forward to staying on it for a long time.

Good- it calms me down when I feel agitated and my thoughts race. At higher dosages it helps with depression. I need it to help me fall asleep and stay asleep for 6-8 hrs. Not so good- I have to be in bed within 15 minutes of taking b/c I start to feel ""spacey"" and eventually dizzy. Unfortunately, if I wake up to go to the bathroom or get something to drink (it makes me thirsty sometimes) then I'm in trouble b/c I'm disoriented and lightheaded. If I get up too quickly from bed, I become very dizzy and have problems breathing like I can't get enough oxygen. I have accidentally walked into walls or lost in my closet. It's concerning that's how my brain reacts on Seroquel. It has negatively affected my libido and I can't orgasm after 15 minutes of taking it. I would have a very difficult time if I had to take it during the day and definitely would have to stop it because of dizziness and blunt affect (aka ""zombified""). But because I take it at bedtime it's ok. I don't want to take an antipsychotic but that's just the way it is right now. I am more med-compliant with my psychiatrist now that I taking Seroquel."

Ive been on this med for over 20 years I believe and started with a low dose (50mg) and ended up on a high does (800-1200mg).  I heard that Seroquel is effective under 800mg and that no more in necessary but Im not sure if thats true.  For the first time in 20 years I am off Seroquel for 18 days today and it has been a miserable ride.  The first 5 days was serious vomiting, nausea and severe headaches.  I lost 12 pounds in a week because I couldnt eat.  So far its day 18 and Ive experienced severe withdrawls.  I did a 3 week taper but it was not long enough coming off that high of dose.  I have had severe headaches, audio issues, smells issues, racing heart rate, nausea, stuffy nose, ear pain and general insomnia.  I think this drug is amazing for it's healing properties but be very careful coming off of it.  Withdraw with a doctor's help and be very careful about tapering it properly.

I can only explain it as ""Restless ass and mouth syndrome"". I was doing wind sprints in my back yard just to shake off the uncontrollable urge to move. Not only that it made me want to eat the butt off a cow and talk nonstop. I could not sleep and didn't feel it did much to treat my depression. I ended up stopping it before my month was up because the side effects were not worth taking anymore even if there was a potential light at the end of the tunnel.

I know that's a very high dose but that's what works for me. I am quite happy happy with Seroquel. I'm a small person, I am 5 feet tall and I weigh 107 pounds. So not everyone gains weight from seroquel.  I also do take lamictal and topamax as mood stablizers, and klonopin. I take the last 3 not only because of the bipolar disease, I also have a seizure disorder. If your Dr. ever suggests that you give seroquel a try, I would seriously consider trying it and see if it works for you!

Talk about increasing anxiety when you cant have sex but really want to.  It tricks you just long enough with an erection for about a minute then nothing.  I am afraid they are going to think I am stoned at work and I wouldn't blame them, I feel like I am.  driving home from work today was very hard, seemed like my brain was running 10 times slower than normal, cars passing scared the crap out of me.

If i were to stop this drug or some moron convinced the drug company to stop making it because they think it is so deadly for everyone just cause it did not work FOR THEM I would literally end up in a mental institution! I NEED MY SEROQUEL UNLIKE some people that want everyone to stop taking it ! U should know better once u take this medication you are supposed to lay down and go to bed not go steal milk at the store! Anyhow this really is a terific drug and i hope they never ever get rid of it god bless u all that r on it!

Like others say, it does knock you on your backside. With that said, it has been almost four years since my last inpatient treatment and I can live with that. I've gotten used to the side affects which for me are mostly the comatose feeling. I take it at bedtime and it helps me to sleep then ""wears off"" and I feel much better during the day. I tried MANY others and this is the one that works for me. It's not perfect but it's better than the alternative....."

I rarely have the horrible mood swings and debilatating depression. My only problem with this med is the weight gain that often goes along with it. I have gained about 40lbs. since taking it. I was also taking it in conjunction with other psych meds. I have been able to get off one of those meds in which weight gain was ALSO a side effect. I have been able to drop a few pounds since then which is good. BUT as for overall effectiveness of Seroquel, I have to say it has been a real Godsend. I don't get tired anymore after taking it, I don't get dizzy anymore. You just have to give it time. I am on a hefty dose considering the dose is XR and I take it twice a day which my pharmacist can't understand since XR is supposed to last 24 hrs. BUT, I trust my psychiatrist immensely so I go with it. But, for anyone starting out on this med, you probably will have side effects in the beginning. Just give it time, it will work.

It's put me in a much better mood.  On the downside, I have trouble controlling my eating.  It's something that I'm going to have to get control of.  I also have short term memory loss.

I see a lot of people talking about 200 mg plus, I can't imagine that.  This medicine along with effexor has worked for my depression but I'm trying to get off of them since I have the worst side effects with weight gain and short term memory loss.  I literally feel like I've smoked a joint every time I take this pill.  For mood swings, it has helped a little, but I feel like a healthy life style is what has been best for me in the past.  Healthy eating and exercise can work miracles.  When I was drinking and partying and not working a lot it was depressing and that made me lose it a little.  So I have been on this med since 2009 bbut I have also still struggled with sobriety completely.

For the last 3 years i've been suffering from grand mal seizures that were considered psychogenic non epileptic, and therefore incurable. they ruined my life. i was a straight a student in academic classes, and i was reduced to being bedridden and useless. I was told by so many doctors that nothing could be done to fix it and i was going to have to adapt to my new life. living like this takes its toll on you. i began to suffer extreme depression and anxiety, to the point i was having psychosis. last year i tried to commit suicide since that seemed to be the only option left to have peace. thankfully A friend figured something was very wrong, and alerted my parents. i was rushed to emerge and spent weeks in different psychiatric wards. I was first put on prozac, to treat the depression and cutting, and it worked. i slowly began to resume a normal life. but i kept having debilitating seizure episodes and landed myself back in the psych ward. There, a doctor prescribed me seroquel. the doctor intended for it to help me sleep and improve my mood.What happened was so much more. My seizures completely stopped!!! i was suddenly calm, composed and in control of my life. Its only been 6 months since i started taking it, but it has completely changed my life. I'm seizure free, no longer have psychosis or anxiety attacks and i will be graduating high school this year and will start a university program next year. None of this would've been possible if it hadn't been for the seroquel. I highly recommend this medication, but please make sure it is right for you.

I was prescribed at 50mg so it would calm me down due to anxiety. It made me a complete zombie, I don't remember 3 months of my life. It made me gain 40+ pounds in that 3 months. I couldn't stop eating, and when I wasn't eating, I was sleeping. It would knock me out cold for around 14 hours a day. It made me extremely depressed and I no longer have any sort of self esteem. I have stretch marks all over my entire body, including shoulders, stomachs, legs, arms, you name it. None of my clothes fit, but I don't have enough money due to being in high school to afford to swap out my entire wardrobe. I can't stand to look at myself and I hold so much resentment for the terrible doctors and psychiatrists who prescribed this deadly drug to me. I don't remember most of my senior year in high school because of it. Nobody warned me about the severe side effects it would have. I have way higher blood pressure, cholesterol, and I need to go to the doctor to make sure I am not diabetic. I can no longer play the sport  I love until I lose this weight, which is hard because it destroyed my metabolism. It also gave me hallucinations when I first was put on it. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IT RUINED MY LIFE. I became a zombie and now I have to become a healthy teenager again. Never take this drug if you want a life.

I've been on Seroquel for years & it works well for me.  Here are some tips for overcoming the most common side effects: if you have weight gain/constipation try using a laxative with prune juice, this should help get your bowels moving and you should be able to lose the weight you have gained; if you have dry mouth or blurred vision, try drinking more fluids and using lubricating eye drops; if you are overly sleepy during the day, try taking Seroquel before you go to bed instead. Also, I would not recommend skipping breakfast - ever.  Eating a good breakfast everyday will help you feel fuller throughout the day & you won't be as tempted to snack on sugary foods.  Most important, don't abruptly stop taking Seroquel without talking to your doctor first.  To do so could have disasterous consequences.  In my case, I would starting vomiting uncontrollably.  Maybe because of a drop in blood sugar?  Don't know.  I hope this helps with Seroquel's side effects.  Be well everybody.

My bed and sun-blocked curtains in my room were my best friend. That is until I decided to kill myself because I had nothing to live for anyway. Don't let your doctor push you into taking this drug even after you have complained about all the negative side effects. Push back and say ""NO""! It does NOT get any better - you build up a tolerance very quickly and the insomnia is back with a vengeance. Your doctor will want to increase the dose. Then back to Zombie mode. Suicide.

124$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/8/2015 7:38:52 PM$Reviewer: ThinkingMonkey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I was prescribed 300mg of Seroquel several years ago by my psychiatrist for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I was also taking about 8 others. Didn't help much and as many of you may have experienced with it, I had a massive weight gain and slept like 20 hours a day. I normally weigh around 200 but was at 260 after about 2 1/2 months(!). I told her I wasn't taking it anymore, it wasn't helping and it had those very severe eating and sleeping side effects. Well, fast forward about 6 years and 2 psychiatrist later and now the new doctor decides Seroquel is a really good idea, 900mg at that, triple what had messed me up so bad earlier. I told her I wasn't taking it but she insisted I at least try it. Lo and behold I felt like a new man and I had no sleeping or eating side effects whatsoever! I couldn't believe it. So I've been taking that dosage for about 3 years now and it works pretty well. The combination of medicine I now take, quite a bit of it, does seem to hinge on my 3mg daily of Ativan though. If I miss a couple of doses it seems to throw EVERYTHING out of whack. None of the other medications seem to work right anymore. So I guess this review is pretty worthless because what I'm saying from personal experience is that Seroquel is horrible and you gain 30 pounds a month and sleep all day and night, but later experience with it proved to work pretty darn good. I would say 'great' but I don't think any medication works 'great', except for Nexium, that is. :)

Immediately after I took my prescribed meds back in Oct 2013, they stopped my suicidal thoughts and overactive thoughts, just at the right time before I decide to do anything rash. My Seroquel doses was altered, at various times, I was on 100mg, 150mg and 200mg. 

The most common side effects were drowsiness, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache and stuffy nose. The worrying one is nose bleed. It made my nostrils so dry it bled when I picked them for a little. 

Overall, I like the medication even though it made me feel like a zombie. I regain stability almost immediately after treatment. There were fluctuating mood episodes - one stressing depressive episode lasting 2-3 weeks - but other than that, things were pretty much fine. After around7 months of treatment, I started seeing a clinical psychologist for therapy and hoping  I can make long lasting changes in my relationships with people.  "

How do you forgive someone for their crimes against you when you can't remember their face? How do report a crime when your too young and drugged and 'crazy' to save yourself. 

I know when my peace will come. It's when I eventually forget everything, and cease to care anymore, a husk again."

There are side-effects, and some are not pleasant but I find that the benefits have greatly outweighed any negatives. In the beginning, I was often tired and had a hard time waking up in the morning, but that has evened out over the months. I also had an initial weight gain of 10 pounds, mostly caused by the Seroquel “munchies” as I call them. And that has also leveled off. You do need to pay closer attention to your diet on it. There is also a strange reaction where you want to move your limbs while you are resting. I found that decreasing my dose some helped with that. 
Now the positives: I have never slept better. I used to wake up multiple times during the night and had a difficult time falling to sleep. I now get at least 8 hours of the night and wake up feeling calm and relaxed. And it is a deep, restful sleep. It does not feel artificial or leave me with a medicinal hangover. Sleep has done wonders for my health. I no longer have bad headaches or muscle cramps throughout the day. I rarely have to take ibuprophen (which I used to take almost daily). No more self-medicating with alcohol or alcohol cravings.But the best and most significant difference is that I have finally found my calm! I can be happy, satisfied and content with little things. It's also made me more patient with others. I now know the meaning of peace of mind. It’s no longer me against the world looking for the enemy in everyone I meet. I feel at ease when I wake up and actually enjoy my morning coffee, watching tv, and reading without interruptions from intrusive thoughts.I no longer lash out at my husband or scream at my kids. My compulsions for self-destructive behavior have melted away kind of like a demon leaving my body. I cannot tell you what a huge relief that is. Everything is lighter without the weight of your own guilt and shame. It gave me my life back"

I was a 5'1"" 115# female. My weight is very important to me. I've worked out the majority of my life. But when I ended up in a hospital for suicidal thoughts, I really didn't even care, think or wonder what this med would do to me. It made me feel better. I worked up to 300mg in a short time (May-September). I have gained enough weight (30 pounds) to make it impossible for me to fit into my clothes. I thought I'll just stop taking it. After 2 nights very bad withdrawal symptoms. I am still going to get off this med but I'm going to wean myself off. I am also a LUPUS patient. I had no idea that this med was making my LUPUS symptoms worse. I realized during those 2 days I did not take the medication. My lupus symptoms decreased.  This CANNOT BE A GOOD MEDICATION. IT LITERALLY MADE ME SUFFER SO MUCH MORE WITH MY LUPUS!! I do not care if my doctor approves or not, I will NOT continue this med, but I will be more careful taking myself off of it."

The medication only made me feel worse. I would lie awake in bed all night (though it only felt like 20 minutes or so) and I could feel my heart beat becoming so shallow I often believed I had died and moved on to another realm. I would shave my legs in the shower and accidentally cut them and not feel it at all. I felt like a zombie, and I honestly believe it made much of my recovery a lot worse. Eventually Ativan did the trick and I'm now 100%, but if you mention Seroquel or Quetiapine to me, my stomach drops and I get anxious. I don't know how anyone is prescribing this...

It is a godsend!  Taking just one of the lowest dosage pills allows my brain to calm down and I fall asleep within 30 minutes.  I feel I am getting much more effective REM sleep but it does cause me to dream more (or at least dream more vividly and remember my dreams.)  One of the nicest things about using Seroquel for sleep is that I am not left with a groggy or tired feeling the next morning.  I wake up fully rested and ready to tackle the day.  I'd highly recommend this drug in a low dose to others who suffer from a brain that won't shut off and allow you to sleep or stay asleep.

My Dad fell and broke his hip on Christmas Eve 2010, and died on June 4th, 2011. While he was 83 at the time of his death, he was living alone, caring for himself, and handling all his own affairs. NEVER did he ever exhibit any symptoms of dementia or Alzheimer's. (Something my Mother ultimately died of)

During the surgery for the broken hip, something happened to him and mentally, he was never the same. Things progressed rapidly and more than one ""doctor"" gave him Seroquel because, and I quote ""It's great for patients with dementia like symptoms"".

It wasn't until after he passed away that I found out the drug explicitly states ""NOT to be given to patients with dementia like symptoms"". It seems this is a VERY common practice with providers.

If you read up on the list of potential side effects Seroquel bestows upon it's victims, while my Father didn't have all of them, every symptom he had, was one that Seroquel listed. (And NONE of them were problems he had prior to starting on it.)

Do yourself a favor and stay away from this poison. At the very least, NEVER let some quack prescribe it for your elderly parents.

I was prescribed it for anxiety-based insomnia and it worked well for me for about six years. However, in my sixth year I started getting symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (involuntary and violent shaking of left arm, dizziness, falling over). Research into tardive dyskinesia confirmed links to using seroquel -- and if not remedied, it can become permanent. My doctor had me in to test for brain tumors, Meniere's disease, we had no idea why I kept falling over and my arm would shake so violently. We decided to see if was the drug. Sure enough, once I stopped taking seroquel, all my symptoms vanished. It's a fantastic drug to counter depression and insomnia, but watch very very carefully for any involuntary body movements. If you see that happening, discontinue the drug asap, lest it becomes a permanent condition.

I suffer from depression & anxiety & have for many years. When I take even a small dose of Seroquel, I feel like a zombie. I feel more anxious than if I didn't take it. It's an underwater, drowning feeling & I just stopped taking it. Knocks me right on my butt & I can't function whatsoever. I'm also on Xanax, 2mg at bedtime for anxiety. I miss the combo of either Zoloft & Xanax or Trazodone & Xanax. Eventually I hope to be off all medications at some point, but I do NOT recommend this medication for anxiety/depression. Try something else first if at all possible. My doctor wanted me on 800 mg at bedtime and 150 mg of Seroquel XR during the day. No thank you!! Horrible drug.

I started Seroquel in March 2006 as a sleep aid (take effexor and lamictal for the bipolar).  For me, Seroquel has been wonderful.  I never want to be without it.  Best sleep I can ever remember; without it, I will be awake for about 3 days and 2 nights.  I'm fortunate that I have experienced absolutely no side effects in the nearly 8 years I've taken it.

This lead to a sleeping disorder that sleep meds did not help. After trying many meds I was given seroquel to try. At first it took 200 mg at night to help me sleep.

It's not intended as a sleep aid, but that's a side effect.  My symptom is that I go to sleep just fine, but I wake up during the night.   I've been down the entire sleep apnea path -- including a painful uvulo-paletoplasty surgery.  I was amazed at the results of using Quetiapine.  I actually get a good night's sleep.  I am 56 years old and am not otherwise in bad shape.  It has not caused me to gain weight.  If it has caused any other bad side effects, I'm not aware of them.  I have only been using the drug for two months, and I make a point of not using it every night.  At best, I'll go every other night.  My sister is an RN, and she is concerned that I am taking it, but so far I do not see what her fuss is all about.

After decades of ""spinning the wheel of antidepressants"", this combo finally has yielded a very positive result.  No more highs and lows.  A great deal more focus, energy, concentration and drive.  Helped me end my love affair with alcohol too...no serious anxiety or worries to hide from. Everything seems a lot less complicated and easier to deal with.  It's not that my life is without problems, it's just a lot easier to assess, address, and handle things.  I have actually lost weight probably due to the Adderall.

It was wonderful, I never had to increase the dosage, and I got a sound night's sleep. After about the fourth year, I started to develop severe parkinson-like symptoms where my left arm would start involuntarily and violently shaking and my hand would curl up and palsy. If I was holding something, I'd drop it. I had no control over my arm and hand. Severe dizzy spells accompanied these random and uncontrollable spasms, many times ending with me falling over. I went to three neurologists, had a catscan for a brain tumor, and all came back negative. My doctor suggested taking me off the seroquel to see if it helped. Within a month, my symptoms had vanished. Be very very careful about using this drug for longterm sleep issues. My quality of life plummeted when we could not discern what was causing my symptoms and it was only after stopping seroquel that my health issues stopped.

It was prescribed for me initially by a pill pushing shrink who made a snap judgement that I was bipolar II after my wife filed for divorce and I asked for help.  I had been on and off anti-depressants for years, usually after failed relationships.  It made things worse, not better, and I ended up in and out of the psych ward six times over the next three years, and each time they increased the dose, finally to  a staggering 900 mg per day, also prescribing high doses of Lamictal, Abilify, Effexor and Clonazepam, at  which point I became a zombie and was unable to function for nearly two years.  I also gained the standard 80 lbs.  I'm my experience this drug and the others represent all that is wrong with ""modern"" psychiatry; blindly throwing questionable meds at the problem without an understanding of the underlying brain chemistry.  My salvation from this nightmare came when I got fed up and started seeing a psychiatrist who had the reputation as being one of the best in the business in a large West Coast city.  She carefully listened to my symptoms, my story, and after a few sessions had me tested for the MTHFR genetic mutation, which occurs in various forms in approximately 10% of the population.  Turns out I had two of the mutations which keep the body from processing folic acid, a common vitamin found in many foods, into L-methylfolate, which is needed to balance the common mood regulators, such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, which I am sure many of you know about if you are on this website.  Her solution was to put me on Deplin, a medicinal food ( not a drug!) and wean me off Seroquel and the other drugs, which she felt were either totally useless or in the case of Seroquel did more harm than good.  Within a month I started feeling much better and after four months I was weaned off all of the meds, completely symptom free  This is my story only, but beware Astra Zeneca and the pill pushing incompetent shrinks."

These are hard to fight-off the sleepiness but can be taken at times when sleep is needed and only other times when agitated, etc. Seroquel will actually cause you to become agitated if someone pushes you in any way while on them. I find that they work best when alone, needing sleep, or in depression episodes where sleep may be desired instead of further depression or anxiety. I can function on Seroquel, as long as I don't take over 100mg.

I worked up to 300mg.  I took the medication at night & it would knock me out for 10 – 12 hours straight.  I gave it a couple months to see if the side effects would lessen.  They didn’t.  So we cut my dosage in half down to 150mg.  I still slept a lot & I could not get moving the next day.  I kept taking the meds thinking things would level out over the next few months.  They didn’t.  The medication did not help my depression at all & on top of that my body felt so drugged.  I was so weak that I could barely take care of every day household chores.  I almost never left my house because I always felt so bad both emotionally & physically.  We cut my dosage down again & a couple months later I still felt horrible.  I WAS A PRISONER IN MY OWN BODY!!  I read that other people gained weight on this medication.  I actually LOST weight.  I have always been thin but while on this medication I started to look like a walking skeleton.  I live alone & I was too weak & tried to even get up to cook.  I was only eating one small meal a day.  It was quite scary watching myself literally withering away.  I finally asked my doctor to get me off Seroquel.  She prescribed Citalopram (generic for Lexapro) and after just two weeks I am starting to feel better & I am eating better also.  I regret wasting almost a year of my life on Seroquel.  I should have gotten off of it sooner.  Live & learn.

Seroquel is effective as a when I have self-harm impulses that are too strong for me to control. Although it is effective, I hate how it makes me feel. It sure beats waking up in a medical hospital with my husband holding my hand after being in a coma for 4 days from Wellbutrin overdose or the shame of being on a first name basis with most of the ER staff because the have had to stich up my cuts on my wrists and neck. I take alot of medications and have since childhood, but my life is different now with a very loving and supportive husband, college diplomas and even a black belt in judo and 2 world champion bronze medals! 5 or 6 years ago if someone would have said I would have laughed in their face. Yes, I hate Seroquel but it does work where none of the other medications I have tried (and I have, over the years,  have probably tried most) It, with the other medications I take is much better than the mental health hospitals that I have practically grown up in over the years. So as much as I dislike Seroquel and my other medications as well, the benifits far outwiegh my displeasure with the side effects and I'm willing to continue with it and consider it as a very small price for the life I now have.

I have been on this medication for sevearal years.  Was at 300 mg. daily along with Klonopin, Wellbutrin, Mirapex (for RLS) and Lamictal.  Then Lithium was added and I developed neurological symtoms so severe that at first the neurologist thought it was a stroke. Developed hypothyroidism (as I had before on Lithium). Physical Therapy, use of cane, inability to drive, poor speech, reduced cognitive skills were very scary.  Symptoms in remission after 3 months.  Then bouts of akathesia (made my legs feel like the nerves were on the outside, feel you can't sit or stand, severe restlessnes). Weight gain was horrible, and increased as dosage increased. 40 ponds in the last year. Hungry all the time. I was just taken off of the drug two weeks ago and I cannot believe the change in metabolism.  Yes, I have more difficulty sleeping (switched to Trazadone) and racing thoughts are back, but I am determined to deal with those holistically and with DBT. I cannot live in fear of neurological symptoms. Neuroleptic Toxicity and Extrapyramidal Symptoms are no joke. In my experience, it is not worth taking and never in combination with Lithium.

I've had problems with weight gain and faced a weight plateu recently, but I'm sure with time it will go away. Excellent for immediate intervention. I was almost hospitalized and I was given this drug and it made an overnight difference. I'm not exaggerating.

I have no depression and really do not respond well to anti depressants, any of them. So I've taken benzo's for years they don't work well anymore and leave me with a severe rebound effect if I do. I sleep very well on this and it calms me more effectively than Benzo's ever did. Even while taking it there's none of the haze, or mental fogginess that I got from Benzo's. And without the rebound effect, and ability to sleep at night I hardly need them more than 2-3 nights a week. The first week I even went up to 400mg throughout the day to deal with anxiety/PTSD symptoms, felt great. Rarely need more than 100mgs a day now and use that to sleep. I do tend to eat excessively on it, but I had planned on moving to a state that allowed medical marijuana if this didn't work so I really can't complain about that. This seems to be more effective and much less intoxicating than anything I've used before hope it continues this way forever.Just remember sudden death is listed as a side effect.

I felt innebriated and out of focus. I did not feel safe to drive. I had distinct memory loss and my temper was shorter than normal. And the mood swings were not resolved at all. I stopped taking seroquel and switched to Prozac to address the moodswings. My OBGYN is quite sure I was misdiagnosed and suffer from PMDD as opossed to bipolar II. I have been taking Prozac for 2 months and feel like I have my life back. Another note worth mentioning is that I've never had a weight problem, and at age 40 have been 125-132 since age 20. Within a month of taking seroquel I had gained 15 pounds. It was a very strange experience. Be advised that seroquel is a very serious, mind-altering drug. It felt very dangerous and unnecessary for me, but again, perhaps it was due to a misdiagnosis.

I've had a difficult time losing the weight and now have fatty liver disease from the rapid weight gain. The drug helped when I needed it, but I wouldn't stay on it for any longer than necessary.

He rarely slept more than a few hrs off and on through the night and had up to 10 violent tantrums harming himself and others. I am not a believer of too many meds but as a single mom of 2 boys, I was at my wits ends. The 1st week he started on 1/2 a 25mg and did sleep better w/ decreased tantrums but them went to 25mg. For 3weeks my baby was extra hyper but tantrum free. Recently the meds started wearing off around 2pm and I can now expect several tantrums until he recieves his next dose at 9pm but his doc will probably increase at out next visit. It took almost 5 years of screaming and hitting and more than most could imagine but we finally have some peace in our home. And for the 1st time in as long as I can remember- my baby gave me a hug and kiss and told me he loved me after a few days of being on this med. Tears of happiness don't come too often. 

Of course he has had some side affects that we are monitoring; extreme thirst and monitoring sugar, increased appitite ( which he is already being tested for that before the meds) "

At first it was a medication for severe psychotic disorders. Now it seems to be used as a catch-all for any type of depression or 
behavior problems. Even a small dosage can have lasting side effects, especially uncontrolled body movements and tics in different parts of your body that may or may not go away. My first experience with it caused my neck to move involuntarily in stiff movements. My next doctor ignored my reaction and gave me a low dosage of this drug. The first night after taking it, I couldn't walk straight; the second night my knee started to click when I walked; the third night my ankles started to click; the last night my neck started to crick or pop every time I moved it. That was the last night I took it and it took a year for my neck to stop clicking when I moved it. Even after that, my doctor ordered refills for me. I didn't take them and stopped seeing that doctor. I think you really need to be careful and if a medication is causing you unusual reactions, stop taking it and tell your doctor. If he won't listen, stop taking the medication and find another doctor who will listen to you and work with you to fing a medication that will help you instead of turning a psychotic medication for a non-psychotic condition."

1. Gaining weight was a problem in the past, however it is not now. Exercising, eating lousy (yes, lousy), and taking supplements to help with the vitamin deficiencies have helped me over the years. My definition of eating lousy is: Ice Cream with lots of peanuts on top. At least once a day. I use protein shakes and mix in good things to make up for the loss of the most vital nutriants. I don't eat junk food, or drink soda. I drink iced tea and water. I've found that no calorie sweetners increase my anxiety. To help with constipation, I take an Acidopholus based supplement. Btw, I am NOT endorsing my methods of eating!
2. Seroquel makes me ""eat walk"". Definition: 1/2-3/4 hour after taking my Seroquel, I get hungry, so I head for the kitchen and get something to eat. Unfortunately, eating kicks in my Seroquel, causing me to stumble about in the kitchen, and frequently falling. I have slept quite a few nights on the kitchen floor due to this. A friend of mine who witnessed this, told me I was like a kid who didn't want to go to bed at night.
My answer to this has been to take a snack with me to bed. Because of this, I have many nightgowns with chocolate stains on them! 
A Seroquel friend of mine was the one who asked me if I had noticed that Seroquel kicks it in much more quickly after eating.
3. Know your dose. If you're on the hypomanic side of bp, talk to your pdoc if adjusting the dosage is right for you. I have found that Seroquel does not help with my depression, so my pdoc adjusts my dosage accordingly. I am atypical, so my dosage needs are normally higher than most others.
4. Don't give up the benefits of Seroquel because of the potential weight gain. Most of us know that finding a med that finally works can be really tough, and side effects come along with the package. There are so many different ways to stay active and get rid of any weight gain you might come across.
If I can do make it, You can too!"

It stopped them right away. I am bipolar 2 and manic with severe depression, primarily due to injuries that changed my lifestyle. I had gone to a mental hospital because I had no idea what was going on, never been manic before, went in to see my Doctor and he prescribed this med, it is the only thing I have found so far that keeps the manic away and works great, my only problem is that it also makes you gain weight which sucks!

436$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/9/2012 5:50:54 PM$Reviewer: Illmissbacchus, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I was prescribed Seroquel and took it for only 4 days total.  I didn't even think the drug would be effective until it had built up in my system but perhaps it was because I was very malnourished and weak at the time I began to react within 24 hours.  It started a manic episode that literally had me smashing my head against the wall at work.  One co-worker found me lying unresponsive on the couch and thought I was dead, really I was just out-of-my-mind with panic, rage, and silent screams only I could hear.  I decided to take myself off it after that, as rogue librarians are frowned upon.  However, and I don't have any proof that this was a side effect of Seroquel and I'm sure people would argue with me but, for eight months afterwards and very seldom, to a far lesser extend, now I experienced pain in my shoulders and spine as if my skeleton were attempting to escape my body through the base of my neck.  I've eliminated all other culprits and those few days of Seroquel were when the pain began.  'Pain' does not even begin to describe what that felt like though. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially those recovering from illness.

My moods seem to be more even and I get amazing, blissful sleep. My only concern is how dependent I may be on this medication with regards to sleep. Since taking Seroquel, I never have anxiety about not falling asleep, and I am concerned that I may never be able to fall into a peaceful sleep without it. Also, my Husband lost his job recently, so we no longer have medical insurance..when i went to fill my prescription I was informed the cast would be about $800. Luckely I went on line to the makers of Seroqual and found a program that would help me with the cost. It's called AZ&Me. I hope this may help some of you."

Also, I've developed healthy lifestyle habits of exercising, healthy eating, and stopped bad habits of using too much caffiene to try to get motivated.

(Honestly it was a blessing in disguise.) I had bouts of mania & depression on & off for over 18yrs untreated. At times I thought that there was nothing wrong with me & everyone else was the problem. During my 20's I experienced feelings of being immortal, invincible & on top of the world. I became a risk taker. All of these actions felt normal to me. I drank alcohol, used drugs, spent money without a care & later have buyers remorse or overwhelming feelings of guilt. Several times a year I would feel depressed & have thoughts of suicide but honestly never thought I would actually attempt it. Deep down I knew there was some type of chemical imbalance with the ups & down. Later I realized my actions greatly affected those around me. When I would start to feel mania or ""normal"",  I would forget about needing help & think everything was ok. Never once did I consider that I may have a mental illness. When I turned 30, I started having lower back pain that is now chronic. 3 years ago I also found out that I have arthritis and fibromyalgia & that these too are chronic. I tried a few antidepressants & pain management, none that really worked. I withdrew from life, stayed in bed & isolated myself, I became agitated, anxious & my stress level was through the roof. My relationship of 11 years became rocky & my partner left. Now, at 38yrs everything finally crashed together. So I tried to take my life.(I'm happy that didn't work out!) I was soon diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder during my hospital stay. My psychiatrist started me on a better pain regimen that works plus a low dose of Seroquel 50mg then up to only 100mg. My pain, mood & depression are more manageable & my relationship is back. I've combined that with therapy & proper rest. I'm back in my life and doing what I need to stay balanced. I have much work to do & may need to up my dose later. It's amazing how this med has evened me enough to enjoy life again."

Aural and visual hallucinations under control- avoidance and/or recognition of triggers a big help. Still have memory hallucinations, e.g., the sound of a fridge or the sound of tyres will trigger a cacophonic symphony inside my head. Concentration and focus improved considerably. Sleeping well, solid 8 hrs a night, quick to sleep and clear head on immediate wake. Even tempered and serene compared to psychotic states. Digestion improved remarkably- no more accidents in public or having to plan a route for every outing that is no more than 5mins from a loo. Don't drink and have given up smoking, craving for sugars initially but now am sugar free. Never used to drink coffee but now can't put the stuff down. Down side is a distended stomach (think of ET) but there has been no weight gain. Libido non existent, incapable of even a faded echo of an erection.
In short, I feel fantastic.

I had no glucose problems when I started but I stopped it after I was in the E.R. for bronchitis and the doctor came back and asked me if I knew I was a diabetic.  My blood sugar count was 300.  I was floored.  I just finished a 3 yr class action suit with AstraZeneca since I'm not the only one but all I got from them was to be bent over and screwed and $5k for a lifetime of the possibility of blindness, amputation or death.  If I sound bitter, you bet I am.  I'm on 2 meds for the diabetes plus about 13 more for chronic pain, insomnia, neuropathy and other things.  It takes me 4 different narcotics to sleep and then it's not the kind of sleep I need.  Some nights, even with all of the meds, there is no sleep at all.

Found out that Seroquel can cause diabetes.  There was a class action suit against them, and they lost.  You can still enter in that suit for a few months yet.  I slowly went off Seroquel, was more carful of my diet, and my A1C a month later was normal.  As much as this drug helped, I will never take it again.

It is effective in that meets the expectations for treatment however it has a nasty ""hangover"" effect.  I've been on it a year or so and I still wake up groggy.  It has other side effects like leaving me tired all day, slurred speech and slower processing.  As an educator, it sometimes impacts my ability to be on my ""A"" game because I am tired.  It also makes me a little irritable--I'm not sure if the trade-off is worth it (e.g., the medication and its side effects in lieu of suffering from bipolar).  Unfortunately, most psychotropic drugs have a downer effect and this one is no different.  It seems my experience is on par with most other people's.  Two things I know for sure, do not drink alcohol while taking this medication and make sure you take it several hours before you go to sleep, despite what your doctor may tell you.  Also, this medication (at least in Illinois) can get you a DUI if you are under its influence and driving.  Be aware!"

Unlike other medications after taking this for a while I do not need to increase my dosage... In fact I can actually decrease my dosage. Unlike other reviews this medication does not make me gain weight, the only negative side effect is being sleepy when I first wake up (however, this is the same affect ambien or other sleep aids will have). If you are experiencing weight gain or concerned about weight gain I would suggest talking to your doctor to make sure your dosage is right. A little goes a long way with this drug. I take 25 mg every night, sometimes less if I am already feeling tired.

Now I am on Seroqel CR and having *some* problems adjusting. Everyone is different but 50 mgs is very high to me and with the Seroquel CR I kind of feel like a zombie in the morning; a bit agitated at night. Prob 'cuz I have tried to cut this in half and take it: Bad idea! Cutting it made me feel sick. Also I have diareeha and trouble driving. **NOTE: I have only been on CR for three weeks: The reg dose I used to take (25mgs) was fine and helped me sleep without anxiety--yet had diareeha only on occasion...when I ate right before bed. If you do feel hungry just eat some crackers or something not anything big--that is the key to not gaining a lot of weight.:) And exercise/eat right..I know *reader eye roll*but it helps. I wish the CR of Seroquel came in 25mg! I would advise eating early if you can and take it WHEN YOU ARE IN BED/READY TO SLEEP.
If you skip a dose and can't sleep that's why 'cuz you may have restlessness from not taking it. Take it the next night;try to keep the timing the same.
Don't watch anything ""weird"" on TV or you can have nightmares- sometimes I just read.
Good Luck everyone and sweet dreams!"

IT IS A WONDER DRUG!!!! Yes I too gained weight in the first month. It was worth it to me to be ""sane"" again!!! I have always suffered from what I thought was severe mania and I would work with my doctor and he let me adjust my meds accordingly. I don't drink alcohol OR do drugs that is a huge factor in the seroquel working for me! I was on very  high dose's of seroquel It was my decision not my doctors because of the delusions prior to me taking seroquel were very scary to me! It was like I was trapped in another world and I wasn't having fun! I  was on an average 300 mil of seroquel every night but at some points 600mil.  I was at the same job for 8 years and didn't even know they (my co workers) were stressing me out to the point I had to take such high doses. Well I was fired from that job and 3 months later I'm down to 100 mill a night and I have NEVER been happier! I'm a hair dresser and my clients all can tell I'm a different person!!! I've started losing weight 10 pounds since my dosages have changed. (  I lowered my meds  VERY SLOWLY,  otherwise you could spiral into depression) It really helps if you know the signs of your symptons. Which I was in denial because I was always happy (or so I thought) I didn't agree with the depression symptoms the internet told me I was having. But I now know it was the truth. I would have lowered my meds ALOT SOONER, IF I realized I wasn't as manic as I thought. I'm not sure if anyone else read before about when depressed we stop taking showers, Well I was only taking showers once a week, for time sakes or I'd be late for work! No one ever knew! I didn't smell or try to cover it up with perfume! Of course I never went to the gym so I was never sweaty and all gross! Well I hoped this has helped someone, if you'd like to contact me I'm at [email protected]'m Kat BTW. Good luck and GOD BLESS"

I had a SEVERE and scary reaction to the combination of Serequel and Ativan - I blacked out in a fugue and had a psychotic episode.  I remember nothing of it but both my mother and husband witnessed abnormal behavior such as flushing all my medication, putting turkey salad in a bowl and pouring milk on it like cereal, and thinking my socks were a chocolate bar.  This side effect isn't included in the 'interactions' portion but there is a caution regarding use of anxiety medication.  Seroquel is DANGEROUS.  I could have seriously injured myself, and its frightening to not remember a thing you did or said while others tell you that you were acting psychotic.  Ask for another medication such as risperidone that isn't as dangerous as Seroquel.

A psychiatrist, not allowing me to so much as explain that I'd had brain surgery 6 weeks prior, within less than a minute declared I was bipolar and told me to stop my Lexapro (for generalized anxiety disorder) cold turkey and start taking Seroquel.  He started me on 50 mgs with the intent of getting me up to 300.  By the 3rd week, when I was up to 150 mgs, I wanted to die.  I couldn't stop crying and I slept for at least 13 hours a night.  I was soooo miserable.  Then my seizures came back with a vengeance.  I called my neuro and he told me anyone with epilepsy is not to take any ana-antipsychotics.  I stopped Seroquel immediately and weaned back onto my Lexapro and saw a psychiatrist who works specifically with epilepsya patients who put me on .5 mgs Risperdal for 3 mos as a booster to my Lexapro to get me through the hump of post surgical depression.  That did the trick :-)  By the way, I've since seen 2 other psychiatrists who have confirmed that I do not have depression, nor am I bipolar.

I thad been years since I'd be able to sleep, or really function in a day to day environment for much more than an hour or two. When my psyche team suggested this drug we talked it over, and I could hear only one downside, and that was the drive to feed within an hour or two after taking the dosage. We started out on a low dosage and worked up and I take it about 2030 and then about an hour later I eat an apple with a piece of cheese, and that pretty much kills the craving to eat everything in site.  I have been on a Seroquel 300XR for about 1 1/2 years now and I sleep like a baby and except for something to shut my mind down it works great. The panic attacks are controlled by other stuff, and I take another anti-depressant, plus topirimate for cluster headaches and it also seems to help with the BPD.

It knocked me out and took a while to adjust to. I suppose it has helped with my mania (I seem to only have them when I drink-- not a good idea). Overall I am able to focus, process, and make responsible decisions now. The draw back is the weight gain- which just in the last six months has become noticeable and embarrassing. That alone makes me dislike my self image- but who wouldn't. The worst part for me is knowing that I can never come off of this drug because I ran out several months ago and experienced awful withdrawals. I was so sick and my insides hurt. I felt like I was dying. I never want to experience that again ever. It was terrible. As long as I take the drug daily and do not drink I am fine. I'll have to do something about this 20+ pounds on my tiny frame though. My clothes don't fit! Just do everything you can to not go through the withdrawals. And consider this a warning- you might get stuck taking this forever. Bonus- AZ&Me has patient plans and financial assistance to those who qualify.

It was not told to me till about June that this was aside affect. I started taking it in January and from jan-june I gained 60lbs (which I had just lost that 60 that past year). It didn't even dawn on me till my dr mentioned it that the medication had increased my hunger. So I stopped taking it and have been trying to lose this weight and have not been able too. This weight gain has also severely increased my depression. So I would not recommend this medication at all!

The SSRI had bad side effects, and I stopped taking. I have tried several different SSRI Anti-Depressants during this 10 year span. Approx. 3 years ago I ended up in a Mental Health Facility, and while in there I saw a psychiatrist. After an assessment the Doctor again diagnosed me as Bi-polar with an added diagnosis of Severe Anxiety w/Panic Attacks, and again tried another SSRI that was fairly new to me at the time called Celexa. I took it for about a month or so until the same side effects I have always had with SSRIs began. So I went to my new doctor and explained this to him. He then prescribed me Seroquel to try as an alternative to an SSRI, at first at a low dosage, than higher as I needed it. Not only did it NOT cause the same unwanted side effects as the SSRIs did, it eased my conditions very well and proved to be extremely effective. It has successfully countered my Bi-Polar Disorder for the last 3 or so years. It also aides with the Severe Anxiety & Panic Attacks (along with Clonazepam). Lastly, I have also been diagnosed as an Insomniac and again Seroquel alone has also conquered that diagnosis as well. All in all, while this medicine is expensive due to the lack of generics (patent hasn't expired) it is well worth the money as I have had multiple disabling problems managed with the use of this one drug. The price of the medication can be adjusted with insurance, and/or a financial plan with the Drug Company themselves who offer RX Discounts, and free medication to those who are in need. The only bad side effects I have experienced with this medication is occasional nightmares, and dry mouth in the morning. I hope this helps anyone thinking of taking this medication. For my situation it was a PERFECT solution, and it may be the answer for you as well. Always talk to your doctor and weigh the pros and cons.

Worked very well but was getting groggy during the day and less focused, also memory problems.Then read it ups triglycerides and cholesterol.Also realized it was used off label and was anti-depressant.Realize there are many people caught in a catch 22 situation and Need these types of meds.,at least short term but Newsweek 2/10/2010, magazine showed studies that seem to prove the newer drugs simply do not work. Short term possibly,(one rebuttal) but to take one then add another which seems to be current practice because one seems to not work as well anymore just doesn't make sense to me related to all the other side effects that then need to be txd. also with more and more meds. and then those side effects from those meds in a vicious circle.I truly believe one of the problems created by preventive medicine is the same problems seen with defensive medicine. Meds are now being prescribles to large populations of people who really don't need them based on unproven results and anecdotal theories. Try reading a few of books now being published about over-treatment in this country. Now I take fish oil and scripts short term only as needed. Have read now that the fish oil doesn't work either but so far it doesn't look like it does harm either.

I lost 60 pounds in the first 6 months and started living life again. I was misdiagnosed in my early 20's as manic-depressive and was prescribed every type of psych drug a person can take. I found a new psych who listened and helped me gradually wean off all of the meds. I no longer take any psych meds at all. I finally feel like my self again! Seroquel caused me to gain a lot of weight, dried out my nose, gave me headaches, caused severe dry mouth and tooth decay, restless leg syndrome, muscle and tendon problems, confusion, grogginess, craved sweets, rebound insomnia, agitation, irritability, clumsiness, blurred vision, racing heart beat, and a overall decline in my health.

621$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/29/2011 4:56:49 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$4$Seroquel was expensive and no fun at all.  After taking my dose, I would be in between sleep and wakefulness.  I would not be able to sleep, but would be very drowsy and yet restless.  It was a very uncomfortable feeling.  I would lie down and not be able to get comfortable.  The uncomfortable feeling occurred whether I took Seroquel in the morning or at night.  I kept taking it anyway.  I can't say how much it helped and how much was the natural course of my bipolar disorder.  But I would not take it again if I had the choice (and fortunately nobody's asking me to.)  Maybe it will work for you, but not for me.  I haven't taken it in years.  Now I'm on a generic version of Lamictal and a generic version of Risperdal.  Risperdal used to have a similar effect on me, but it doesn't anymore.  Maybe it was my drinking that caused the unpleasant side effects.  Who knows why these drugs work this way?  I sure don't.  But I'm much better without drinking.  I recommend it (quitting drinking).

I have obsessive compulsive personality disorder (which includes generalized anxiety disorder)as well as chronic depression. My OCPD is actually quite helpful when it comes to work and some social situations, so I don't take anything daily. I only take Seroquel a couple of times a month, so I have not experienced any weight gain. 

What I love so much about seroquel is that  when I'm starting to get worked up and breathing heavy and highly agitated, I can take half a pill and it makes me feel really really normal. Seriously. A normal I haven't felt in my life. 

I've taken it when I interviewed at my grad school for admission. I had 2 days of classes I had to sit in on and tons of important people to meet and impress and blend in with. SO stressful. I popped one in the morning when I noticed my hand shaking, and BOOM! I got a little tired about 5 hours into it. 

I took it once when I thought I was upset before a family gathering, but it turns out I didn't get anywhere near a panic attack and ended up falling asleep at the dinner table. 

Seroquel really really helps with my panic attacks. I have used these anti-depressants without too much success: prozac, zoloft, celexa, and fluoxetine."

I couldn't think straight or formulate words.  With permission, I got off the meds as soon as I could. I was told that Benedryl helps to get this stuff out of your system (I did take it), but 4 years after stopping the medicine I still occasionally still twitch.  If I could go back, I would have asked the doc if there wasn't something more safe for my problem (20mg Ambien wasn't working).  If you can't sleep, take something else.  It's not worth it in my opinion.

It did help with my anxiety and depression and with sleeping problems. Its much safer than benzo's, and my body became used to the feeling (I know some antipsychotics make you so sick but this one didnt). One thing though, if you are taking a high dose, it can be scarey waking up the first few times and going about your day. The first night I took it I felt like I had been anesthetized and waking up, I had to really lay down for awhile (try not to fall back asleep), be careful when I got up and walked around, and when I did get up, I ended up having to lay down on the floor before passing out. But if you give this medication time, it can work for you (I know diff meds work for diff people), so just give it about 1-3 months if you can handle it. It does get better/ easier and side effects usually dissapear.

It left me feeling very ""slow"", uninspired (I am an artist and this has been difficult for me).  It immediately relieved the mania, but not the depression; that took quite a bit longer (about six months).  Other strictly anti-depressents were much faster acting relative to depression.  It (the Seroquel) also gave me nausea and a sense of apartness from others.  Maybe that was good, given how difficult a time I was having coping with others in that period,a nd that I had recently been extremely traumatized by an abusive relationship w/a former partner.  I don't think I would recommend this drug for everyone.  I think there are others that may do as well and that the pharmaceutical that manufactures/distributes it allows me to obtain the drug free-of-charge is part of why I THINK it may have been given me, rather than something else.  I don't know.  Prozac and its family caused greater mania (and anger) and, at the end of the day, when I am not exercising and getting enough rest, all my symptoms reappear anyway."

I gained 30 pounds in one month and could never ever get the weight back off! It gave me diabetes and almost sent me into a diabetic coma within 2 months on it. And I was only taking like 100 mg a day-the therapeutic dose for bipolar patients is 500 mg day. I do not know if a person in their 20s could take this but diabets is such a severe side effect that if it occurs with weight gain it is not woth any benefits unless you are absolutely so bipolar you are a risk to yourself and of harming others and even then this and all meds in its class are so toxic I have to wonder why the FDA would approve it--its not a terminal condition to be bipolar..and there are alternatives far safer. It also makes you so out of it its like being on methadone or heroine--its like a narcotic-i think addictive nad sedating the crap out of patients who are manic is not a solution with these side effects.

This medication slowly kills you if you don't die because of its similar action to alcohol. It was just like being drunk except no euphoria. I was expelled from public venues while on this drug because the consensus was that I ""was drunk or on drugs"". I was refused service at fast food and told the 'cops have been called"" because I was staggering and slurring speech. I cut and bruised myself countless times without knowing how.  I tripped and fell because I could not lift my toes when walking. All this as a man in his prime.   Being compelled to be on this drug because to refuse would have resulted in depot injections of an even more damaging and debilitating drug still has me exasperated more than a decade later. I was subjected to an injustice by being compelled to eat this poison and an insult for being billed for  the cost of the pills.  Every time I see an auto accident I wonder if this drug or some other psych med is involved.

This chemical should be banned and the knowledge of it be allowed to expire from human consciousness.

It effects healthy and not so healthy persons  and mammals in an identical fashion.  It has no core effect.  It is a confusing blend of side effects and produces extreme paradoxical reactions within only a few hours in some individuals.
   It is carcinogenic and how a doctor sworn to ""do no harm"" could consider it for inclusion in their practice baffles me."

I hope this will help anyone reading this comment. God bless and keep you and in the way of a suggestion, if you decide to try Seroquel, ask your doctor for a week's supply to try  it. If you are on Medicare, a month's supply of Seroquel is $6.30, a month's supply of Seroquel XR is $ 6.30. Walmart will fill your RXs and send  them to you VIA US MAIL."

Since starting I no longer have suicidal thoughts which used to be a daily thing for me. My anxiety has decreased and I finally am able to go out by myself. I used to be so nervous aboout being alone and what people were thinking when they saw me. Nothing else has been anywhere near as effective as Seroquel. My only complaint is that I take 300 mg XR at bedtime which my doctor instructed me to take at 7pm so I will be able to sleep and get drowsy around 10.

My condition was mild and primarily depressed with some anxiety and OCD until trying Lexapro a few months which triggered an awful mixed episode. At first, as with almost everyone, I was started on a low dose of Seroquel, in my case to be elevated in three stages. The first two went pretty smoothly after a few days of brain fog and fatigue. I did not feel 100%, but was alot better than I had been, and started to enjoy life again. My depression was greatly alleviated and my anxiety became totally manageable.  However, I have had a very hard time dealing with the third stage of titration (still a comparably low dose considering how much some others are taking), which even after a few days I am finding too sedating and have new side effects such as a kind of pressure headache. I know it needs to be bumped up as the initial relief I have had with the lower dosages have waned a good bit. I am just really hoping I can adjust to it and get the same results consistently in the future. Also,even with insurance, this is proving to be a very costly medication. I am happy with it because it is the only med that has provided many any relief, but you may want to discuss alternatives considering its sedation and high price.

I ended up knowing I had to try something else.  I am a nurse and I called our mental health facility.  They told me to come in and after an extensive interview, I was admitted for four days.  They stopped my meds and put me back on Effexor, but Klonopin for anxiety and added Seroquel 100mg.  The first night after I took it and went to bed, I felt a burning in my shoulders.  This is often related to my anxiety episodes so I figured the new meds weren't going to work.  Next thing I knew I felt this wonderful peace come over me and I slept like a baby.  After three days the nurses said,""You're feeling better, aren't you""?  And I sure was.  I took Seroquel for about a year and added talk therapy.

Took it @ 2oo mg 1/daily before bed for 4 years. Worked GREAT for sleep. Eventually put me in a zombie state, very irritable, irrational.  My heart began to pound, so much so, went to ER and was diagnosed with a rare heart condition. called Left post. ventr. block. Stoped taking it, and  the ""panic attack like symptoms stopped.

My recent concern with this medication is how high your cholesterol can go, such as mine under 200 going to 297. After 3 mths of none of the medication, sleep does not come easy so I have taken 25mgs several times versus the 200mgs a night I took in the past. Yes, I do have vivid dreams and have bitten my tongue or cheek while sleeping. Yet, we all need our body rested. A difficult dilemma to say the least.

Yes, it does tend to give one the munchies and I actually gained enough to need 'weight loss surgery' caused by it and maybe other medications I was on. But Seroquel WORKS for me and I can already tell a difference in the short time that I've been on it this time around. I take 100 mgs. at bedtime so I don't feel buzzed all day long and am able to fully function, driving and everything. I feel at peace with myself now and I've learned from my past weight gain from it to 'nip it in the bud', not giving in to the eating urges. Instead having a diet root beer or bottle of water to fill me.
I've been on SO, SO many different drugs with my hypo-mania that I've discovered that EVERY SINGLE ONE has side effects but if the benefits out way the side effects, we are blessed.

You have to actually try for more than a week. I take Seroquel XR and haven't seen any reviews for that yet. It is only my second night taking it and I can feel myself stabilizing for the first time in years! Yet the over sleeping sucks but being bipolar mixed, I'm used to it! So you just have to accept it and work on yourself! And also weight gain is a big thing with depression too! So really if you get your butt up and be active I am sure you can conquer that, Plus everyone is different. My experience so far is dry mouth and oversleeping.

I have been on Effexor for five years, which began with 75 mg. was increased to 150 mg, and then to 225 mg. before beginning the Seroquel. Once I started this one, the Effexor was bumped up to 300 mg. Since beginning this high dose combination, I have gained 26 lbs., began chewing the skin on my fingers (nervousness), have vivid nightmares, constant sweating, dizzy spells, loss of memory, itchiness, sleepiness, losing my chain-of-thought in the middle of a sentence, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. On one occasion, I passed out in the bathroom, and woke up in a fog – wondering how and why I was in the floor. While the severity of the depression, anxiety (and muscular pain from Fibromyalgia) has lessened, I continue to have little interest in getting out of bed, leaving home, interacting with others, and driving. In the past, I have tried other medications for depression (e.g., Prozac, Celexa, and Cymbalta), and did not have as many issues. I took Prozac for about six years and only experienced talking excessively. With the Celexa and Cymbalta, I experienced insomnia and continued having episodes of depression and anxiety, but not as severe as I had when I did not take any medication. With the symptoms I am having with this current combination, I am not sure which medications will work for me, but I plan to consult my doctor about a few of the medications some of you mentioned (i.e., Abilify, Remeron, and Lamictil). Also, I have a prosthetic heart valve and the last thing I need is an increase in the symptoms I am having with the Seroquel!!

At first I saw double and slept like the dead. I would bump into walls after taking it, so I took it right before I went to bed and had no difficulty. I had somewhat of a hangover in the mornings, but that went away after 10 - 15 minutes of being up and about. But I felt better in a few days, better still in a couple of weeks. After a week or two, I adjusted to it and felt no side effects except a little morning hangover. Small price to pay for sanity. This can be a great med for many people. I'm bipolar II, rapid cycling with 3 suicide attempts. It was like magic for me. Ride out the initial side effects.

I was perscribed many different drugs, but this is the ONLY one that works for me.  No more suicide attempts and my moods are much more stable.  It does have some side effects but if you can learn how to work with them, they aren't an issue.  I've never ever been able to sleep at night, but an hour after taking Seroquel, I'm out.  I love it.  It did cause me to gain 30lbs, but once I fought through the cravings, I was fine.  Lost all the extra weight and my diet is back to normal.  Since I take it at night and it knocks me out, I know I need to get at least six hours of sleep or I get the ""hangover"" effect in the morning.  The only thing I don't like about it is that I get ripped from my sleep at least once a night.  Nightmares, but the racing heart is a little scary.  It goes away within a minute or so of me waking.  Then I'm back to sleep without any problems.  I don't mind the nightmares.  It's better then spending weeks at a time in Psychiatric care.  So yeah, I love it.  "

My Dr wants to increase it til I get to 200mg daily. Problem that I am having is that at 100mg daily, I am sleeping til noon and have become very lathargic and have lost so much of my motivation. Before taking Seroquel, I worked from morning til I went to bed never stopping. I was always in a state of being very manic. I take it with 200mg of Zoloft daily. If I am this lathargic at 100mg of Seroquel, what am I going to be like at 200mg? I'm very worried about it. I don't see my Dr for another month but in the meantime, I took it upon myself to drop the dosage down to 75m daily. I came to WebMD hoping to find a list of side effects from Seroquel but so far haven't seen any.

I am in NO means saying that every adult or every child will have these same results,but for our granddaughter & for us,Seroquel,along with therapy has been a life saver.

It must work for some people or it wouldn't be here but just be careful if you are a diabetic or prone to anxiety.  It makes no sense to me that a drug can cause anxiety and drowsiness at the same time as they are opposite reactions but I had both!

I was experiencing very bad agoraphobia after a near death experience. So I went to a shrink who turned out to be a massive quack and he diagnosed me with bipolar disorder (which I don't have). I gained about 30lbs in less than 2 months but was able to sleep (I have insomnia). I think I was taking 100mg and unfortunately after stopping the medicine went back on it because of my insomnia and the fact that nothing works for it. I now have weaned myself down to about 25mg a night. But I have experienced : weight gain, excessive thirst and urination, high cholestrol, blurred vision, dizziness even while sitting, close to blacking out while driving, neuropathy in hands and feet, massive brain fog, memory loss etc. Unfortunately I do not sleep AT ALL without taking this medicine. I have tried every medicine out there and nothing works for my insomnia. Went months without taking it and was extremely sick and in and out of hospital from lack of sleep. I want off this medicine before it kills me but the lack of sleep will kill me too. 
Please do not start taking this medicine do whatever it takes to never take this drug it will ruin your life. I once was intelligent but now I have so much brain fog that I can barely spell or remember simple words. Not too mention dizziness, neuropathy, weight gain, blurred vision etc.

Works great for insomnia but not worth it. Do not take it!!!"

Works pretty good for sleep if you aren't considering the side effects. After a year of taking it, I started gaining weight. I gained about 30 pounds. It also makes me irritable when the medicine starts to kick in. Like I HAVE to go to sleep right when it kicks in or I get really mad and start crying. You feel very drugged when the medicine starts working.
But it does help you fall asleep fast, sleep through the night, and wake up without feeling groggy.

936$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/3/2010 7:08:02 AM$Reviewer: Riga, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$4$Seroquel worked wonders once when I was experiencing a consistent feeling of unreality for days. The very next day I began to feel at home in the world, not anxious or depressed.  However, as soon as the drug started to take effect (I took it at night), I would be so dizzy I couldn't walk without holding on to furniture.  I would fall asleep anywhere--on the floor of the closet while looking for something in a box, on the floor on my exercise mat, standing up in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee.  I'd wake up when the coffee spilled or I started to fall (if I was standing up), but I had a horrible experience waking up on the floor of the closet covered in clothing that had fallen on top of me, not being able to remember where I might be--it was pitch black, I was covered in something--was I in hell?  I didn't think I was dead but I was terrified until I crawled out of the closet and realized I was in my bedroom.  My husband would find me sleeping on the floor all over the house.  So, I went down on the dose. Still had side effects (less though)and it didn't work as a sleeping pill for me. Right now I'm trying not to take it until I need it again.  It is a VERY effective drug but side effects are surreal.
937$Condition: Other$6/30/2010 2:26:44 PM$Reviewer: Southern Lady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"I started taking Seroquel four year ago to treat severe insomnia.  I started taking 350 mg.  After two months of hardly any sleep and feeling ""homocidal"", this drug finally got me the sleep I needed.  However, as with others who have written, I would get the ""munchies"" within 1/2 hour of taking it and gained weight.  I also feel like a zombie in the mornings unless I get about 10 hours of sleep.  Over time, I whittled down the amount of dosage little by little.  I am now taking somewhere between 35-38 or so mg. (I cut the pills with a pill cutter).  This is the least I can use without disrupting my sleep. I still have trouble getting up early (less than 8 hours) in the morning.  The way I resolve the ""feeding frenzy""  I take the Seroquel within 10 minutes of going to bed before the ""munchies"" kick in.  I eventually want to get off the drug all together because you know the damage presdcription drugs can do to the kidneys. ""less is more"" in this case, which is why I reduced the amount of dosage.  For those using Seroquel just for insomnia, experiment with dosage reduction and go to bed directly after taking it to avoid overeating/raiding the fridge and gorging (yes....I did it and gained 25 pounds.....trying to work it off)."

About 2 times a yr I cycle and my dosage has to be adjusted, my depression is nothing more than a blue day occasionally and my mixed manic swings are almost non-existant...Seroquel is extremly expensive...am waiting on the generic!

I took my first dosage in the morning before work. At work, I became very dizzy and hoped that it would subside. I completely fell out-fainted but did not lose consciousness after feeling dizzy. Then I started suffering from rapid heartbeat and my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest. The Medic was so scared for me-as soon as he listened to my heart he said you are going to the hospital I do not like the sound of your heart. If that wasn't scary enough I became convinced I was going to die panicked in the ambulance begging this medic to not let me die as I had never felt my heart do the things it was doing. I was put on a EKG and given charcoal solution to drink I guess to soak up rest of drug in my system. That was only on 1 pill-100mg-I basically overdosed on the medicine that I was prescribed. It was the most awful experience of my life. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.

But if you start having neg effects they are most likely only going to get worse. This cured my anxiety/panic attacks @ a low dose of 150 mg. My psychiatrist raised it to 400 mg and w/in a week I lost control of every party of my body and the side effects outweighed my anxiety/panic attacks. Massive twitching and muscle spasms from my face down to my ankles, I couldn't make my eyes stop moving and I was starting to see things jump and things that were not there, foggy mind, slurring and stuttering speach, hot and cold flashes, cold sweat, I did not feel more hungry but I never felt full so I ate all the time, tingling from face to legs, my mind was not sharp (I had trouble even remembering simple words and barely was able to finish a complete sentence), forgetfulness, constipation (had to see gastrointerologist b/c I wouldn't have bowel movements for a week @ time..very painful), anxiety b/c of my fear of the side effects...I never understod how a med could make someone feel like they're dying but I was experiencing all these symptoms @ one time and it became unbearable. Withdrawal symptoms are just as unbearable as the side effects. Simply put, Seroquel made me feel like every part of my body and brain was going through retardation.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started on Seroquel.  Within a week I felt like a different person, constantly in a fog.  And good god, the sleeping...I slept CONSTANTLY.  When I took the first dose, I got up once to use the bathroom, and other than that slept for 30 something hours.  I gave it time for the side effects to wear down and continuously slept for at least 14-16 hours a day until I stopped taking the medication.  Also, I gained over 40 pounds in 4 months while I took it.  I felt hungry constantly.  It helped with my depression and bipolar at first, but after a month or so, what good effects it had wore down.  Before taking this I could've been considered a nymphomaniac (an effect of bipolar, I know), but this medication made me lose ALL interest in sex.  And this has become a long-term problem.

Also, DO NOT GO OFF THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT TAPERING OFF WITH HELP FROM YOUR DOCTOR.  I could no longer afford it, so instead of paying attention and tapering off of it, I just stopped.  I was sick for days.  Felt horrible mentally and threw up constantly.  

This medication may help some but it was absolutely horrible for me.  If you have issues with it, talk to your doctor instead of thinking the effects will go away.  "

i got on lithium but kept the seroquel and i was perfect. once i got past the severe headaches (2 to 3 times a week-cure sleep)and diarreah(everyday plus vomitting for teh first two weeks, now i randomly get it), the lithium helped with my mania and with seroquel i get the sleep i need at night(with the occasional dream of hell or some taboo thing).SEROQUEL BY ITSELF DID NOT WORK BUT IN COMBO WITH A ANTI DEPRESSANT AND ANOTHER BIPOLAR MED IT WORKS WONDERS,a  PSYCHOLOGIST THAT I HAVE SEEN HAS SAID THAT COMMONLY IT TAKES TWO BP MEDS TO WORK EFFECTIVELY but everyone is different, i am more stable now than i ever been since i was 13 years old, its put an end on the strain its caused my family(dealing with a unstable bp in mania = divorce, and now i am studying engineering in college) "

Good combo of drugs.  However, Seroquel's side effects are considerable.  They are manageable, but you have to put in some effort--get blood tests to check your thyroid and cholesterol and fats, eat really healthy and work out or you will gain weight, schedule your days so you can always get 9-10 hours of sleep even if you have to go to bed by 8pm.  The heart palpitations don't hit me if I stay in bed once I take it--the palpitations only show up if I try to fight through the drowsiness to move around, so I just plan to be in bed for 10 hours.  It's a question of what you're willing to put up with to be stable emotionally.  Bipolar made my life hell, as long as I could remember, and for the first time, I've been stable for more than a few weeks at a time.  2 good years and counting.

A decade ago, I was involved in a very traumatic experience that sent me into a downward spiral. I was diagnosed with acute clinical depression with PTSD and Anxiety. After trying every single anti-depressant out there with no improvement and some worsening the conditions, I finally got on Pristiq. It helped a lot but I still suffered from mood swings occasionally and insomnia every night. My dr prescribed Seroquel. I am much more calm. I was on 300mg but have gone down to 200mg. I take it at night. At first, it knocked me out almost immediately and I slept through the night. After being on it for over a year, it's not as effective at helping me fall asleep but once I am asleep, I stay asleep. 
However, there is a HUGE side effect that I've suffered greatly from and that is weight gain. I've gained 45lbs since being on it. When I would take it, I would develop the munchies identical to those you get when you're under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. The desire for food is too hard for me to fight. However, I am a food addict so I am sure this plays a lot into my problem with not being able to control myself when I get the ""hungries"" this drug causes. Other than that, I've had no other side effects besides daytime sleepiness but it usually wears off once I get going. As well as this drug has worked for me, I now have diabetes and am morbidly obese so I plan on switching the drugs around. I recommend this drug to anyone who is NOT a food addict and needs a boost to their antidepressant and help sleeping at night. Try to stay at the lowest effective dose you can to minimize side effects. Wish me luck! I am going to switch to abilify and try ambien or lunesta again, even though they haven't been that helpful in the past.  "

Like others here have mentioned, it makes me crave sweets like there is no tomorrow.  I gained 8 pounds the first month, then realized what was happening and stopped giving into the cravings.

Overall, Seroquel is my own personal miracle drug.  I've seen several people mention that Seroquel has abuse potential.  The only recreational value I can imagine would be to use it as a sleep aid.  "

In 2wks, the meds had lost effeciveness. The doc uped the dose. That's when things went medically horriable. Agian, this is also when he was doing so well in school as a zombie, but medicaly he was suffering. He started stealing and hoarding food from increased appetite. He gained 20lbs and went up 2 pants sizes in 3wks. His peditrian told me it was having an affect on his heart and overall health. That it's not safe or recommended for someone little and young to gain that much weight that fast. When i told his med doc, he was discussed w me. I told him i wanted my son off sequel immediately!!!! In less than 3 days my son stopped stealing and hoarding food. He wasn't mad all the time. He's been off the med now for about 3 wks. He's still hasn't lost all the weight he put on due to sequel, but he is loosing it slowly. Which his ped says is a much healthier way to do it. His heart is not nearly as stressed and he's no longer a zombie.

First starting it was a lil rough just because you do feel really tired for a couple weeks, but nothing to bad. Especially in comparison to how I was feeling. I was getting panic attacks on a daily basis, and then crashing hard into depression. I started at 50 mg 1 x a day, now I take 400mg 2 x a day and have been very even. Of course there are ups and downs.. as life does throw us curve balls here and there. But I have felt able to cope with them. I also take Zoloft for depression, that combo has worked out really good for me. I am thinking about adding lithium to my regime just because I am now starting to have higher ups and lower lows.. maybe that will help balance things back out. All though I have had a lot of recent stresses added to my life, a little something extra would probably help me out for a short term thing. If you haven't tried it, it's worth giving a shot!

I've also noticed/experienced a constant need to move my legs (restless leg syndrome), shakiness in my movements and voice, dry-mouth, increased temperature/fever immediately after taking, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), mental/mood changes (e.g., increased anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts).

I was a mess, hadnt slept in months, manic right to the edge. Then we found Seroquel.  From the 1st 25 mg dose, I felt different. I worked slowly up to 150, didnt like the effects at that dose and went down to 100 mgs. Doc and I agree that sometimes the dose needs to be adjusted to help me cope with stress (which brings on the MANIC MONSTER) but lower dose is usually good for all.  And it allows me to practice other coping techniques. So I watch what I eat, control the carb cravings with health snacks and get my 8 hours.  I would rather deal with the side effects than live like a lunatic on the fringe.

My blood pressure hovered around 60 over 40.  I kept losing my vision, falling down, heard buzzing or ringing sounds, slurred my speach.

It was terrifying.  

I had taken seroquel for a couple of years before having the acute adverse reaction.  

I also became so sleepy I would sleep for two or three days at a time.  

When I finally stopped taking it I lost 35lbs.  I believe that the medication has very long term effects on my brain.  I haven't taken it in three months now and I still feel foggier and more stupid than I used to be.

My memory seems to be permanently changed.  I cannot remember as well as I used to before taking this drug.

Physicians are prescribing it to large numbers of patients now.  I think there will be a large population of people who are less intelligent than they were prior to taking the drug.

Also, there is no cure for hypotension.  So, if you get it like I did, you are just plain screwed.  Spend time considering these side effects.  I think they may be permanent.

Then after taking it for about a year developed HIGH cholesterol (651) and OFF THE SCALE  triglycerides (over 4600 - yes 4600 - not a mistake) in blood tests at Mayo Clinic. A soon as  I stopped taking it and all went back to normal with temporary help from chol/trig meds.  By the way docs at Mayo are not allowed to give it to diabetic patients.

Also had other side effects which made it not worth it. Extreme fatigue in the mornings, cognitive blunting (i.e. felt like I was in early Alzheimers) never realized I don't have a horrible memory until after I stopped the medicine 3 years into it. Now my memory is completely normal!

That in itself has been a god send.  Being able to sleep after years of insomnia is amazing.  I am concerned about the weight gain.  Has been approx. 30 lbs over the four years.  I have a wonderful man in my life who thinks I am still beautiful, very important!!!  I worry about the blood sugar but so far so good.  I go to sleep about an hour after taking but have found a schedule that works for me.  Won't babysit my 2 yr old grandson overnight because I can't guarantee I would wake up if he did.  Getting up in the morning has become a little more difficult so will need to adust for that.  Just have to find what works for you!  I know this drug isn't for everyone, that's for sure.

I would hate going to see him, for fear that he would be dead.  I have never seen him look so bad.  It was HORRIBLE!  He never left the house, sat in the dark until it was time to work, went home and did the same thing again.  I told him to get off of it.  Wean himself off for 7 days.  He wasn't happy with me, to say the least, but he knew he was a mess.  A year later, 1,500 miles away, we got a call.  His dad was DEAD.....  Coincidently, he was taking the same medication.  His parents found him, like I imagined finding my son.  But, they were not monitoring him, like I was doing for my son.  My ex's heart stopped...  He wasn't sick, no heart problems, but he was taking too much medicine, and it stopped his heart.  He was so messed up from it that he couldn't remember how many pills he had taken, and took more.  55 years old, with no health problems, and DEAD!  This medication should be BANNED imediately.  My son use to complain about how I made him ""STOP"" taking his meds.....  I haven't heard a thing since his dad died.  I know he appreciates what I did, even though he wasn't happy about it in the beginning.  If you have any other alternatives, use them.  This med is dangerous & deadly.  Try medical marajuana!  I may be weird, but I believe that it is natural, and safer than anything out there.  My son refused to try it, and then last year, he did at 33 y/o.  Said it was the first time in his life he felt ""normal""......  And I am totally against illegal drugs, more than most people.  But, I believe that natural is the way to go.

I was on 400mg/day for just over 2 years, and was also taking 300mg/day of Lamictal.  At first the Seroquel was beneficial, but after a while the side effects began to greatly outweigh the positives.  It was great for putting me to sleep, and though I didn't have too much trouble waking up, I did have problems feeling awake for most of the day.  It also gave me double vision for a couple of hours mid-morning, which obviously made all activities difficult/dangerous.  I also experienced auditory hallucinations, though not intense or alarming.  I truly only noticed them once they were absent after stopping the medication.  The withdrawl was horrible.  I was constantly sick to my stomach, could barely eat, and vomited for over a month.  However, it was worth it!  I still experience mild hypomanic episodes, but not as serious previous to the Seroquel.  I still remain on the Lamictal and it has been a savior.

I feel very lethargic when I am awake, and since taking the drug, my mood has not returned to normal. Constipation and dizziness are other negative side effects I experience on this drug. I plan to start reducing my dosage immediately, so I can eventually stop taking it altogether.  "

I have been prescribed the strongest narcotics such as fentanyl, morphine, oxycontin, etc. That just takes the edge off to where I am ablt to move. Sleeping is impossible. I was going up to almost 5 days without being able to sleep. It got to the point I felt like I was being tortured, and couldn't function with 2 children. So thank God for my psychiatrist! Where my regular doctors did nothing, he never stop trying to find something to help me. Hence, Seroquel. The 1st dose, I slept so hard! Like a baby. I woke up more refreshed I couldn't believe it. 
As far as people who have a drug history being prescribed this medication, I dont think they should be. I do believe it has some sedative qualities and can be sold and abused. But I have seen my psychiatrist for 5 years and knows my circumstances and doesn't just give it out like candy. He discusses the medications purpose and explains why he suggests that I try  that medication. So if someone is being given the medication and selling it, they are the ones who end up ruining it for those who really need it. Especially when it doesn't get you ""high""."

This past summer, my doctor added seroquel in addition to the zoloft. We began at 50mg. At first, it seemed to be helping. It did make me very drowsy about an hour after taking it. If I tried to fight it and stay awake, it felt like I was drunk.  Then my moods seemed to get worse.  The doctor gradually increased the dose to 300mg.  In the past 3 months, I have gained almost 30lbs.  Prior to the medication, I was hardly hungry.  Now it seems like I can't get full.  Also began cutting myself when extremely stressed.  Not sure if this was from the seroquel since I don't have a history of cutting.  I found it very difficult to wake in the morning.  I have a 19 month old child and I never hear him cry in the mornings.  It's a good thing my husband is home to hear him. Having a young family, this drug was very difficult to use.  Having to take it pretty much as soon as I got home, to make sure that I would get enough sleep to hear the alarm in the morning.  I needed to have at least 12 hours of sleep.  It's just not possible to spend time with my husband and take care of my child on this medication.  
At this point, my doctor is gradually decreasing the dose and we are going to try ambilify (I think that is how to spell it).  Hopefully, it will work better for me.     "

I take 400 miligrams before bed - sleep through the night-have rem sleep now - so it helps my fibromyalgia too. Wonderful medication.

I have taken many medications for bipolar disorder and sleep depervation, but this was the worst!! My Dr. said he could put anyone asleep and at first I was excited to be able to sleep.  I was raised every month, up to 600 mg a night.  The side effects were a night mare for my whole family, as well as myself.  I was on this medication for a little over 2 years and have been off now for about 5 years and some of the effects are still haunting me, I fear I will never be the same again.  My eyes, my memory, my sleep disorder, my physical and emotional self, are still effected by this nightmare of a drug, and I haven't seen or heard from my  husband since just before I desided to go off it. I use to look pretty good, tall and thin but now I am very heavy and threatend by type 2 diabetes.  My advise to anyone who is having trouble w/ serequil, GET OFF  i CAN ONLY HOPE AND PRAY TO GET MYSELF BACK!!!!!

I am fully functional thanks to this medicine: attending work, spending time with friends and family, maintaining a healthy romantic relationship, and volunteering in my community. That said: this drug is NOT for everyone, and you should try drugs like Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor etc before you try this drug because the side-effects can be horrible. My side effects are dry-mouth, severe drowsiness and akathesia, a painful panic=like attack that can cause me to walk around my apartment in circles for an hour or two after I take the drug. Luckily, my doctor and I found Mirapex, an anti-Parkinson's drug, to stop these panic episodes from occurring. I take a significant dose of Mirapex before bed, when I take Seroquel, and also usually smoke a small amount of marijuana, and this has allowed me to enjoy the benefits of Seroquel without the horrible panic. If you have akathesia as a side-effect, and the drug is helping you, please try Mirapex before you give up! 

Finally, please note that every story in this thread is one person's personal experience - including mine! - and none of these stories are an accurate portrayal of what you will experience yourself if you try this drug. I mean this as both a warning and an encouragement; only you and your doctor can decide if this drug is right for you, and I hope our stories make you more informed in this decision. God bless."

It does cause nighttime munchies and dry mouth but otherwise I feel great.  I don't feel groggy but I think that is because of the degree of mania I was dealing with.  I have read other reviews and people need to know there are alternatives available. If you are experiencing terrible side effects you need to try a different drug or combination of drugs. Most of us have to endure being a guinea pig until the right balance of meds is found.  Hang in there & you will get your life back.

After taking the 25 mg. tabs for a short time, I found myself sleeping most all of the day and when I was awake I would nod off into sleep. She told me to continue to take the drug but I went against her advice.I hated the way I felt on the drug.  I felt tired, more depressed and crazy, all i wanted to do is sleep all the time. Not recommend at all & after doing research it is VERY addictive. So be careful if you do choose to take this.

Helped me to sleep at first, but after about the 6 month mark it did not help with sleep as much. Did not seem to help the paranoia and anxiety. Really, it just helped me sleep at first and stopped the racing thoughts. Caused akathisia within 1 hour of taking it at first. Close to the 1 year mark, the akathisia became persistent and lasted all day. Caused me to have an extremely unnerving feeling that I can't even begin to describe. This was usually within 1 hour of taking it, but was persistent throughout the day with a higher dose. My muscles were twitching really bad all the time.

Period. I was on this drug for a little less than a year, and in that time, I literally could not function. Then, one day, I ended up checking myself in to a pshyciatric ward,  because of the side effects of this medicine. All at once, I could not swallow, followed by severe confusion, muscle rigidness, and psychosis. I WAS TERRIFIED to say the least. I spent two days there and was taken off the drug. After a few weeks, I started to come around and feel halfway normal again. I feel sorry for anyone who is taking this obviously harmful medication, and the fact that this product is still on the market and people are taking it, bothers me. Hope this helps someone out there.

But now, for many reasons I have decided that I do not like being on the medications and decided to slowly back myself off.  So over the course of 3.5 weeks I took myself from 300mg a night to nothing.  The only problem was as soon as I started backing myself off I started getting nauseated and dizzy, and now that I am completely off I am nauseated and dizzy on off through out the day every day.  I have been off completely off 1.5 weeks now.  Has anyone else experienced this? I have always been extremely sensitive to medications side affects but I was just curious if others have experienced this as well.  Thanks.

It was only MODERATELY EFFECTIVE in helping me sleep and it had terrible side effects. After taking it for a week i noticed i had less of an appetite than usual and had already started to lose weight. I hallucinated and saw shadows moving across the walls, i heared voices and noises coming from both inside and outside our home. Soon i believed that someone wanted to harm myself and/or my family in some way and we were all in danger. At the end of the third week of taking Seroquel i had stopped eating altogether and i had lost almost 30 pounds. I couldn't work because i had so much anxiety and depression due mainly from extreme sleep deprivation. I was hospitalized and treated.

After practicing the usual sleep hygiene recommended by regular Dr which includes breathing relaxation, no caffiene etc. I started with 25mg of Seroquel. I'm now up to 50 mg because i still wake up during the night frequently. My main problem with this drug is the fact that I need to take it no later than 9pm to get to sleep by 10:30 or so to be able to get up on time for work the next day. On Seroquel, I need at least 9 hrs of solid sleep otherwise I feel hung over the next morning. This means no late movies or other activities with friends/boyfriend unless I take it later in the evening and cut the dose which means I probably won't sleep very well. Am also concerned that I may need to increase dose the longer I'm on it. Haven't really had any side effects other than grogginess in the morning and I don't feel safe driving after taking it. 
Talked to my Dr about getting off eventually & she said its unlikely as I have some mild generalized anxiety and possibly low seratonin levels (as many women over 30 do). Apparently Seroquel is not addicting like Ambien/Lunesta but I would eventually like to sleep on my own and hope its possible down the road. If you start Seroquel don't be surprised if at first it knocks you out for up to 15 hours (try it first on the weekend till you adjust)."

Weight gain, so far has not been bad but I was overweight to begin with.  I give this drug a 9 out of 10.

I was on it for about 3 weeks. When I got up to the 300mg pill, things started going down hill for me. I still don't remember a lot that happened when I was on the med, and I started cutting again when I was on it, sometimes with no memory of cutting myself. I had bruses from bumping into things all the time, and it was basically like being drunk and high constantly. It was not fun. The first night I took the 300mg pill I wet the bed cause I was so knocked out I couldn't wake up to go to the bathroom. 

I went to the doctors because I had slight whiplash from going to an amusement park (while on the med) and not being able to control my head on the roller coasters. When I was in the room my speach was slirred and when I was walking to the waiting room I had to be guided out, and I've been going to this place for years and could probably draw map of it from memory. The PA, nurse, a woman from the front desk who has known me since I was a baby, and my case worker all stopped me before going in the waiting room and told me that I needed to be off this med, because of the effect it was having on me. A different doctor perscribed it for me, and the PA called him and told him I was to taper off Seroquel right away. Getting off the med probably saved my life."

Despite medication, my illness grew from mild depression to a total inability to function in the '00s. Nothing worked until I was put on Seroquel. Like magic, the negative loop that ran and ran in my mind stopped. Yes, I've gained weight (it does seem to trigger late nite eating) and the restless legs sometimes drive me crazy, but I can function again. I even got a job and have been able to keep it! If this had not worked, my doctor was recommending electric shock therapy, so believe me, I am thrilled.  Having taken so many meds over the years, I am convinced that each individuals brain chemistry or whatever you want to call it is as unique as his or her DNA.  What works for me may not work for you.  Side effects that I can tolerate; you may not be able to stand.  But until my doctor tried Seroquel, I was hopeless.  The only thing that kept me from committing suicide was my dogs and not wanting to leave a mess for my family to clean up, either literally or figuratively. Oh, it is also expensive as hell, but I'd pay for it even if I didn't have insurance.  Hopefully, it will become a generic some day soon. Finally, it does make you sleep and sleep and sleep.  I've just had to adjust my life so I can allow 9-10 hours a day for sleep. It is worth it to me.

At first(on 50mg) it really helped alot with sleep. I slept throughout the night every night. But had problems waking up and feeling very groggy. After about a month my mind and body were used to it, and now at the max. dose 300mg, I still sleep well, but its almost like an all day, all night hypnotic(meaning I dont feel the need for my anxiety meds throughout the day UNLESS something really stressful arises. Its not very addictive at all, but If you go two or three days without it.. you do feel like your gonna lose it and need it.. not out of withdrawl, but because it works so dang good your mind begins to trip. It takes care of anxiety;stress;insomnia;lossof appetite;and depression. 5 in 1 drug! I have alot of personal information and great stories to tell anyone on here that is intrested in this medication. Email me at [email protected] and I will tell you anything you need to hear about this medication - one of my most knowledgable prescriptions.

I immediately felt loopy, drugged, and foggy.  I am generally not a very angry person, and with this drug I got irritable and down right mean.  Within 20 days, I was hospitalized with an altered mental status and was told it was a severe reaction to this drug.   To this day, I don't have a memory of much of the hospitalization.  To boot, this was my first hospitalization in my life.  I later found out that since I take an anti-hypertensive and Metformin, Seroquil is not recommended due to severe side effects.  My doctor was fully aware of all my medications and prescribed Seroquil despite this knowledge.  I have since been off Seroquil and found another doctor.

Is it Bipolar depression or major depression?  Big differences in the two.  He suggested this medication because I have failed many trials of anti-depressants.  I have been on this medication for 4 months at 300mg.  The first 2 weeks of taking this medication were a blur.  I remember being in a daze, disoriented, dizzy, and very very tired.  Ok, I gave it a few months.  The verdict, I am not impressed with its powers as a depression fighting drug.  On the other hand, I do suffer from sleep apnea and insomnia and it actually helps me fall asleep.  I take it 2 hour before bedtime, and by bedtime I am about to fall over, boy does it make you sedated, but I am no longer tossing and turning for hours before finally falling asleep.  It takes me about 15 to 20 minutes and I am out!  A good sedative for sleeping but not so much a good mood-stabilizer/anti-depressant.

It used to take me hours even days to overcome a mood swing, nad I now I jump right out of a bad mood w/in 20 minutes. I take about 1 to 1 1/2 hours before bedtime so I'm not as groggy in the morning. It is hard to wake up, but after I drink coffee and get going I'm fine. This medicine gives me a crazy appetitie, uncontrollable. I'm going to try Sensa to help curb the hunger and will keep you posted on whether or not it helps. I do recommend this medicine for mood swings!

1360$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/11/2009 3:50:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$I've tried a lot of antidepressants over the past few years. All the drugs I've tried either didn't work or worked for a bit before they stopped working. Last week, I went to my doctor to follow-up on the Pristiq I've been taking. I told her that some days it seems to help, but other days it seems like I haven't been taking anything.  I also told her that a month or so ago, I was feeling good so I stopped taking it for about 2 weeks and felt great before I crashed. She said it could be that the drug worked its way out of my system, or it could be that I may be bipolar.  I told her that my therapist has had me tracking my moods, and she thinks I may be hypomanic.  My doctor said most people call the doctor when they are feeling down and think they're depressed, so a lot of the time, bipolar disorder gets overlooked.  She had me fill out a questionnaire, and the results showed borderline bipolar disorder. She suggested trying Seroquel. She gave me a starter pack which starts at 50mg on the first day, increases to 100mg on the second day, and goes up to 200mg on the third day.  My doctor said to take the Seroquel at night because it WILL make me drowsy.  I took my first dose (50mg) on Saturday night and woke up on Sunday in a major daze. My husband kept asking me if I was ok. By late afternoon/early evening, I wasn't in a daze anymore. I took my second dose that night (100mg) and woke up on Monday morning again in a daze. I took the morning off work because I was afraid to drive. It almost felt like I had been drinking. That night I took the third dose (200mg). I woke up today feeling very dazed, although I'm coming out of it now around 3:30. I stayed home from work today and called my doctor to see if this was a normal side effect and to ask whether it'll go away. They called me back and said the doctor is calling in a rx for Abilify instead. I hope that helps. The Seroquel has helped with my racing thoughts, but I don't think the daze I've been in is worth it.

It works really well but it does have many side effects. I gained 50 pounds and I now have Type 2 diabetes. I have to be on Seroquel regardless of the side effects. I cannot sleep without it and I am a basket case if I do not sleep. Seroquel is extremely expensive if you do not have insurance. It costs around $750 for 60 pills a month without insurance. And please if you take Seroquel at night, don't get out of the bed because it will make your heart race, which can be scary. I take them only at night and when you get used to Seroquel it gets easier to function. 
Now, if you start to eat more than usual try stopping by taking a appetite suppressant or try to beat the cravings by eating vegetables. Otherwise, I can't function without Seroquel.

I know it works differently on everyone but I am bi-polar and my mood has been stable for the first time in my life.

I take 300mg before bed and I sleep very soundly.  I have to be disciplined about getting up or I could sleep all day.  Once I'm up for a while I'm fine and do not feel tired like other people who are using this drug.

Warning:  Do not stop taking this medication abruptly.  I did this because I couldn't afford it (no insurance) and I got very very sick.  I have been sick everyday for two weeks and I've started to take it again but I'm still sick.

Working is a nightmare but I have no choice.  If I don't work I don't get paid.

It's a great drug for some of us but be careful if you stop."

Over the past 6 years, I have gained almost 100lbs.  I went off the drug temporarily, and was able to lose 40lbs.  My bipolar disorder resurfaced, and I had to go back on Seroquel because nothing else worked.  Unfortunately, I gained the weight back.  I am very unhappy with my appearance, but am pretty much stuck on the medication.  I had to weigh out whether my mental health or my weight was more important.

If I don't take warning to my mania, I will be awake for 3 nights and four days before I completely crash and burn for 3 straight days, waking only to use the bathroom. Seroquel has, what I consider, literally saved my life. Bipolar is a life sentence, unfortunately, but I can maintain a wellness because of it.
1421$Condition: Other$7/10/2009 9:18:02 PM$Reviewer: lady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been taking this drug on and off for several years (usually around 75mg/night), primarily for severe anxiety (sometimes a little psychotic). I also have a history of major depression and 2 manic episodes. I do not know if these meds have an effect on my depression because that lifted 4 yrs ago and hasn't returned, and my moods are stable. I suspect that it helps because this is the longest period that I have ever been depression-free. Because of the sedating effects, I definitely feel less anxiety, and so far it has been the only medication that has helped me (I have tried many over the last 14 years). Some anxiety remains, and I still get panic attacks, so I will have to start something else as well. The drug has not been as scary as many of these reviews, but I am on a relatively low dose. Also, don't be turned off by people who complain about the initial side effects. This med takes a long time to stabilize. For the few weeks I was so tired I could barely function, but it was less every day. Now I just need a morning coffee and I'm good. If I miss a dose it is really obvious because my anxiety sky-rockets again. The only side effect of concern is extreme irritability and emotional volatility in the morning that declines as the afternoon approaches. I'll snap at my lovely husband for no reason at all, so have learned to walk away and avoid him when that happens (only about once every few weeks). It's like really bad PMS in the mornings. It's still definitely worth it.

1434$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/1/2009 7:57:25 PM$Reviewer: Rachelle S., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I take a very small dose of Seroquel XR - just 50 mgs - a few hours before bedtime to help with sleep.  I was told this formula (the Seroquel XR) reaches peak levels approx. 4 hours after taking it and have found this to be fairly accurate.  A very important reason that my doctor has me on this drug in addition to Trazodone for slee is it also helps minimize my anxiety and mixed episodes, which is a very good thing!  I was on a higher dose (200 mgs) but found it caused me too much fatigue during the day.  I have had some weight gain with this drug, but that was primarily when I took more, not on this smaller dose.  (The weight gain could also be related to the combination of drugs I take: Depakote XR, Trazodone, Pristiq, Abilify, Klonopin, and Seroquel; so I can't just pin-point it as the Seroquel.)  I did notice that when I first started taking Seroquel it had much more of ""an impact"" at sedating me then it does now.  The smallest dose could tire me out within about half and hour.  This effect has worn out though now.  Overall, I would say Seroquel is a very effective drug for me.  I know several others that take it (for varying reasons and with varying effects on their energy level) so I will say it's very important with this drug - like all prescriptions - to really find out how it will affect your sleep and energy and why it's being prescribed at the particular dose it is being prescribed.

I am being treated for Multiple Personality Disassociative Disorder.  I had to fight to get access to Seroquel. With my medical history I would not have stood a chance with any other prescription.  All the other drugs available to me would have put me in the hospital because of their interactions with everything else in my life.  Seroquel and Zoloft have made my life liveable again. I was taking only Zoloft but my symptons were getting worse and it was not fun.  I do not drink, I do not smoke and I have not had any adverse reactions to my meds together.

I had terrible side effects. First i gained 40pds. Then i was a zombie the next day and i am a 32 yr old woman with three children. It also raised my triglycerides alot. Normal is under 150 and mine was 609. High triglycerides can cause damage to your pancreatitis and can kill you. I am having a hard time remembering things and i have problems getting my sentences straight. But the worest of it all is i was diagnost with Tardive Dyskinsia which is terrible i now have movements with my mouth and tongue that i can't control. If you look up the side effects on this drug they say its suposely rare to get Tardive Dyskinsia well i guess i was that one in a millon. This drug is terrible i don't reccomend seroquel to anyone. Now on top of taking my normal biplor meds i have to take Niacin for my Triglycerides and 200 iu of vitamin e complex to help control Tardive dyskinsia. My dr told me that Tardive Dyskinsia is sometimes irriversable. Which means i will probaly have to live with it. I would not reccomend seroquel to my worest enemy. Now my dr has slowly taken me off the Serquel and put me on Geodon. Wonderful drug it gives me lots of get up and go and a different out look on life. It opens up your eyes. The only side effect with Geodon is at first its kinda like Seroquel when you get up in the morning its hard to get up an go but my dr gave me Adderall 10mg to take in the morning and i now have know problems. So to all you people out there with Bipolar with panic attacks and aniety DONT TAKE SEROQUEL IT HAS RUINED MY LIFE!!!!

First off it works really, really well for mood stabilization, and if you have insomnia it works really well for that.

IMO, it is the second best, with Zyprexa being the first.

However, here are the problems.  Sleepiness all the time -though not near as bad Zyprexa.

Constant, constant, constant hunger.  Over about four years of taking atypical anti-psychotics.  I went from 190 lbs to 270 lbs.

My doctor took me off of it and put me on Lamictil.  Almost, immediately, I started shedding the pounds.  I take other drugs that suppress appetite, but I will say without a doubt that the Seroquel just simply made me way too hungry, and too fat.

Look if Lamictil did not exist, it is either taking the Seroquel or having to deal with major depression and dizzying highs.  I would opt to take Seroquel."

It worked very well for sleep and stabilizing moods.  The down side is that I could not function on less than 10-12 hours of sleep, my hA1c (diabetes) has steadily climbed, and my weight has increased 30-40lbs.  The doctor switched me to trazodone a few days ago.  I was supposed to slowly drop the dosage down to get off it.  I disagreed with the doctor because I love the medication and decided to cold turkey it.  I stayed very sick for a few days and its messing with my physically.  This isnt ideal but I HAVE to get off it because of my diabetes managment.  Overall, this is an awsome drug I could even ignore the weight gain if it werent for the diabetes.

The worst and only problem with the drug is the uncontrollable earge to eat excessively shortly after taking it. As well as the pattern of sleep that is so deep and requires about 10hrs a day, I feel it isn't safe to sleep so deep when on one occurence the building fire alarm went off. The building was evacuated and I didnt know until two days later.  I do not recommend using it with children in the home and the weight gain isn't controllable. Another disadvantage is that problem of not being able to stop taking it. If you go out of town and forget it to bring it you will not sleep and become very sick the following day.

I tried to make it work, but I started to notice several things. First I started falling when I got out of bed. Then I could not catch myself with my arms. Then a few days later I started having tremors and my head would shake like Parkinson's. One day my boss told me he was concerned because I have forgotten things that I have done normally for years. I went to a neurologist and he said that my left side of my body was unstable. 
After talking with my doctor, he recommended that I switch to Lamictal. Lamictal has been a life saver for me.. that is when I started to truly heal and be able to make decisions. I would say that if you are having symptoms that are worry some and scare you, please talk to you counselors and therapist. You have to find the right combination when you have this disorder.

Though i have recently heard that it possibly increases  risk of adult diabetes... hopefully I find it is minimal and I can continue to make progress in finding happiness in life.

Certainly the meds do not MAKE us happy, 
they were very difficult for me to ""swallow"" when I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety.  I refused to think I needed to take pill to be happy.  Of course I have learned, they don't create the contentment, but they help us to balance our chemistry to combat the symptoms.  

We are all different, and many times the first medications prescribed don't achieve the proper results or even worsen what you are dealing with in the first place.  

Dealing with depression on some level for over 15 years myself, I've been through all kinds of presciptions... and just in the past couple years found a combo that is finally effective for me. 

So if you find the meds you are taking now aren't quite right or simply dont work... keep trying.  It will be very frustrating.

Seroquel, along with Lamictal and Lexapro, has helped me to better deal with my depression, anxiety as well as other issues... more effectively than the many other med combination I have tried.  

I hope this can help at least one person out there!"

I have gained more and more weight, putting on about 38 pounds since I started. Also, it makes me sleep wayyyy too much.  I take it before I go to bed and if I don't get 12-13 hours of sleep, I'm still exhausted.  I've missed many college classes and some days of work bc of oversleeping. If I don't take it for even one night, I get no sleep (even less than before I was taking it, which even then wasn't much) and the next day I feel really sick all day (empty feeling in the stomach but if I eat anything I feel nauseous).  Is there a chance of addictive qualities with this drug? It worked reallllly well for me for a couple months, but has slowly worn off and isn't worth the side effects.  I feel sick a lot and am always tired.  Also I've lost nearly all sex drive.  I'm going to my dr to get an alternative.

Those meds combined with a pain program i took part in, I got back to school, back with my friends, and back to my normal self. One bonus for me is that it helps me sleep, which was an issue because of the severe headaches. After 10 months on this medication, they are finally weaning me off. I have been very happy with the results of this medication and I am glad that my Dr. prescribed it for me. I would not be back to my normal self if it was not for this med and the pain program.

I HAVE to eat--a lot. I have gained 25 pounds in two years. I run and exercise at least 4 times per week and eat NO sugar or fruit. I cannot lose the weight, and my cravings persist.

I used to get crying spells before I took Seroquel, and those are gone too. I also talk to people more freely and a lot of my social phobia has gone away.

I gained a lot of weight off from the Seroquel, and it messed with my head a lot. After I took it I felt extremely lethargic and sleepy. I didn't sleep well, I'd often scream in my sleep and wake myself and everyone around me. The drug made me more confused than anything else, I didn't feel as sad as I did before, but I also couldn't feel happy (unless I was over tired from taking it), it was like I was numb. Nine months later I had a second suicide attempt, I was sent to a different mental health hospital and they replaced my medications with Lexapro, Wellbutrin and Topamax (mostly to help my weight situation). I just got off all my medications last spring, so it's been almost a year now that I've been medication and therapy free. Althought Seroquel can actually treat people, I don't really recommend it for most.

This medication is two-sided. I have control over my thoughts and impulsiveness but am constantly tired. Within 20 minutes of taking it at night I can't even speak or walk. If I don't get 10 hours of sleep I can barely function the next day. If I do get the 10 hours then I feel ok. The thought and mood control is great but the zombie/hung over feeling isn't. I'm thinking about stopping because it is beginning to affect my focus at work.

It has kept me out of the emergency room for about six months now. I take 400 mg at h.s. make sure you are laying down after you take it due to loss of coordination, i am not kidding, it really knocks you on youre butt it also keeps my brain from working overtime when im trying to go to sleep. It gives me a full night sleep without the grogginess in the morning. I sleep uninterrupted. I also take the 50mg during the day prn for irritation and anxiety, it really helps me get through the day. The only problem I have with the drug is I have no insurance so it costs me an arm and leg, about 400 dollars to have it filled, and there is no generic available. So it is an expensive way to help me be a productive member of society.

I love that it helps me sleep, and my mood has been pretty good.  I've recently developed some really weird side effects though - some nights when I go to bed my heart pounds so fast and hard I'm afraid I'm going to have a heart attack, and I've started having irrational fears and panic after taking it at night.  I'm a perfectly normal professional during the day, but after taking Seroquel at night I'm convinced evil spirits or ghosts are going to get me, and have to sleep with a nightlight on with all the doors in the bedroom closed and locked!  Not a lot of fun!! I'm waiting to get in with the doc and have started tapering off.

Well all this one did was make me sleep. Which I don't need help with. I have other meds that are fine but this one makes me angry easily, frustrated, gained almost 20 lbs in 6 months, nearly gotten myself into several altercations due to this medication having such an negative effect on my behavior. Which is was to make me more stable...all it did was make me want to harm others. It had gotten so bad that I actually drove myself to my the hospital & literally cried for help as I knew if I continued on this path that one day it would cause my end. With little help from this medication, severe weight gain in little time, mood altering & sleep inducing, for me this medication was THE worst thing my doctors could have put me on.
I have family who has been helped wonderfully & no lead normal & happy lives due to this ""wonder drug"", but for me it was a terribly scary experience that I would never want to experience again."

I am trying to lose weight through diet and exercise with minimal loss (1 pound in 1 month of hard exercise and following weight watcher's diligently)  I find the exhaustion I initially experienced went away, but is now back again.

However, I have experienced weight gain.  I had gained about 9lbs. previously while taking other meds.  Since switching to only Seroquel at 300mg a day, I have gained 5lbs more.  I think that this weight gain is due mainly to the medication.  I have had difficulty losing any of the weight and keeping it off.  I have never had a problem with being anything but slim before in my life. I have also had problems with grogginess, tiredness, difficulty waking up from sleep, and some difficulty in concentration.  My dose has just been decreased somewhat and I look forward to seeing if that eases my side effects.  It seems to be effective at helping me think positively.  As far as its effectiveness at treating regular depression apart from bipolar disorder, I think it is only somewhat effective at that, as I still have some symptoms of depression. The manufacturer of Seroquel, ""AstraZeneca, is trying to get approved for use by people suffering from depression.""  I have been on it for about a year, and will think it is very effective if I have had no bipolar episodes 3 to 4 years from now.  The Wall Street Journal online has some good articles about Seroquel and its efficacy and safety.

1615$Condition: Schizophrenia$3/1/2009 6:47:23 PM$Reviewer: Zooid, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on 1500 mg of Seroquel going on three years. I could not ask for a better treatment. I had an initial weight gain of about 15 pounds, which hasn't gone away. I take the full dose at bedtime. Within 45 minutes I am out and need at least 10 hours of sleep, or else I am so groggy that functioning for the day becomes difficult. About the second year in, my symptoms and minimal side effects began to recede exponentially. I haven't had problems with my blood sugar or have shown signs of diabetes. Constipation was a problem for a long time. One side effect that will not go away is that if I do not take the medication at night I cannot fall asleep and can literally be up for two days without feeling overly tired. So having a few doses in your car, at your friends houses, on you, and places of the like is important. If you miss doses there are noticeable spikes in symptoms that can last several days. Also keep drinking to a minimum. There has been a few times when I drank too much and had to stay in bed for about 15 hours before I had enough energy to crawl out of bed. There is also a very personal side effect with reduction of libido, sexual stimulation and production of semen. I had very weak orgasms paired with no ejaculation. I now have as regular bowel movements and orgasms as I ever had, with the exception that in the mornings, when the drug is still strong in my body, I cannot ejaculate. I am so grateful for this drug, it truly is a miracle. New users, know that it takes time for you to heal. Schizophrenia is a scary illness that tweaks the associations in your brain, it takes a while relearn reality by forging new synapses, Seroquel helped me rely more on facts than delusions and helps me think that my delusions are just that. If you have been on smaller doses for a while and your symptoms have receded little, ask for an increase, it will help. Rely on science and logic to identify your delusions and time and Seroquel will help them dissipate. God speed.

Even if it did fall asleep, any sound could awaken me after 2 hrs. without ability to go to sleep.  Dr. said I desparately needed sleep so she Rx'd this & told me to take 300mg. the 1st time & it would knock a horse out & keep me asleep about 24 hrs. & told my husband not to worry if there was no movement or he couldn't awaken b/c I really needed to sleep.  It worked just as she'd said.  Then I was to take 100mg. ea. night at bedtime.  It will make me sleepy in an hour but I can stay awake if to much anxiety.  But 200mg. will definetly make me sleep.  Problem is that w/ 100-200mg., I usually sleep 10-14 hrs.  If I can wake upp after 8 hrs., I very groggy & can't drive for business.  So I don't take it nightly as I should.  I still have sleep deprivation, but try to take it at least 2-3 times per week on days when I know that I'll be working from home.

The Seroquel completely knocks me out about 30 minutes after taking it. I've noticed a sort of tired drugged feeling til about noon the next day when I take it. I'm also told that I talk in my sleep a lot when I take the Seroquel.

My Dr at the time put me on 200mg a day, and even though I wasn't feeling better, he kept it at that.  In the long run, he ended up up being a terrible Dr, so of course I switched.  My current Dr is awesome, and has me on Seroquel, Klonopin, and Lamictal.  I ended up spending a week in a psychiatric unit with severe anxiety and panic, about 6 months ago, before I was on my current treatment regimen.  After all of that, and during my stay in the hospital, my final dosage is at 600mg per day (50mg morning, 50mg afternoon, 500mg bedtime).  It has worked very well for me, both with my anxiety and my moods.  I haven't had a bipolar cycle in a long time, so in my opinion, Seroquel is an all-around wonder drug! :)

We have been on abilify, respridol, depecote, lithium, and who knows what else. We have awsome spych nurse but the children's hospital has acted like he is responsibe for his disorder and can controll his actions. Why are some mental health professionals so ignorant?  He has been on this med (300 mg) for a year now and his moods have been fairly stable, for him that is, with the zoloft, clonodine, and topomax coctail he is on. When he started on this med he was like a zombie for months, missed school because I couldn't wake him, and when he was there he fell asleep (still does occasionally)to the point that I was threatened with court action. He has had major weight gain, which continues at 3-5 lbs a month. He is closely monitored, but even with that he is now experiencing health problems that are a direct result of this med. His triglicerides are off the chart, blood-pressure is too low, sugar high, and occasional chest pains. Since we have been through most of the available meds for his dissorders, and he is relative stabile,it has been decided that taking him off of the meds will cause him to crash. I am in the process of working with the doctors, med and pcp, to decide what to do before... I'm not sure what could happen to him, but I was told his situation is dangerous. I know it isn't fair that there are not better meds out there, or ones that the side affects wouldn't kill you, so what is a mother to do? Either way it seems to me that my son is the looser; breakdown- suicide attempts or diabetes, heart disease, or stroke. What would you do?????

I have to take it with my Effexor XR, as the Effexor makes me feel manic. It's only been 2 weeks. Effexor XR has helped me lose 4 lbs. I wonder what the Seroquel will do now?

This medication has not helped me at all with any of my issues, in fact, it has made me feel like a zombie throughout the entire day.  I also find that it makes me extremely sleepy so I am not sure why she has prescribed this medication twice a day.  I’ve spoken to her numerous times about this issue because it is affecting me staying awake at my job which is not a great thing.  I’ve also been experiencing extreme abdominal pain to the point where I could hardly stand up straight.  At first I thought it was gas which causes bloating and pressure but then I found out it was because of this medication.

I honestly don’t recommend this to anyone due to the ineffectiveness of the product and because it will make you feel like a zombie for at least 99% of your day.  Before I took this medication I actually felt better so I am now at the point of lowering my own dose by cutting my pills in half each day and eventually I will stop taking this medication and seek out a naturopathic or holistic route.

I feel that doctors today will prescribe medications to patients without being totally honest about what other products are out there, so we must do our own research.  I have come to the conclusion that doing your own research and finding a doctor who wholeheartedly cares about your well being and is interested and/or willing to try alternatives before giving meds that will make your life “less productive” can make the difference in solving the problem or having a medical condition that can affect you for the rest of your life.

I now have a set of $3,000.00 FULL DENTURES!!  I was prescribed this med. for sleep (diagnosed Bi-polar in 1996) along with Restoril, Valium, and Ambien CR!  I have gained a ton of weight, and wake up in the middle of the night (3-4 hours of sleep)!  It's about the strongest thing they can give me for sleep so I still take it nightly.  I really hate this drug!!!  If you take this medication, I STRONGLY recommend you see the dentist every 3 months!!  By the way...Serowuel is NOT approved for the treatment of sleep disorders!!

Light headed, dizzy, sweating, feeling like I'm going to throw up and even pass out. I moved about 2 hrs from my psychiatrist and she wouldn't give me enough medicine to make it to my next appointment, and wouldn't call it in either, so the withdraw from it is terrible.

I took only a little bit of 25mg and it already helped me w/those things. It is not hard to wean off, not much of side effects. My shrink and I both love this meds. Yes, it does give you a bit of hangover next morning but it will go away if you can sleep a bit more (2-3 hours more in the a.m.) I am fine with that. Compared to Zyprexa, this is not as ""strong"" and ""mean"". Lowest Zyprexa dosage can make me sleep days and nights."

Over the years I have taken every med that is out there on the market and some would work for a little while and then stop working. I have had horrible side effects everything from weight gain, body trimmers so bad I could not stop slobbering and hold a cup of coffee, liver damage, high cholesteral, I can't tell you all the side effects that I have had.
I started seeing a new doc and she suggested that we try seroquel and I was at my wits end because I did not want to end up back in the mental hospital I just wanted something that was going to work.  I started taking it and everyone said they could see a difference in me that was for the good I was like my old happy self again.  I have been able to stop taking the anti depesants and the sleeping pills and the anti anxity pills. This drug has made a world of differance for my life I am able to get up and do things, be with my family and friends and I am happy.

And my sleep cycle is backwards - awake all night and sleep all day. These meds have been wonderful but my continuing depression had escalated sleep disorders and the remaining depression from which I could not dig myself out despite the addition of a full spectrum light box I felt I needed something else if it were available.  Seroquel 50-150mg has done the trick for me for my lingering bi-polar & clinical depression.  All 3 meds + my light box have worked wonders for my 'dark night of the soul' and for my insomnia types.  Now I'm hoping to get my sleep hygiene back on track & wake up w/ a better outlook for the day. Or at least an outlook that is realistic. I'm also a Type II diabetic, controlled by diet & exercise & I have found that Seroquel does, in fact, raise my blood sugar.  My FBS ranges are now 109-118, but my 2hr post prandial sugars are in my range of 120-135. Hope this is helpful.

I do agree with the other posts that you really need to be able to sleep 9 or so hours otherwise it is very hard to get out of bed in the am.  My doctor wanted me to switch from Seroquel and try Geodon instead but the Seroquel works so well I don't want to switch.  I also take 300 Wellbutrin for depression.  I have not had any weight gain but am on a low dose of Seroquel.  I have been using Seroquel for about 10 months and have not had to increase the dose for the same effectiveness so that is good.

The md should really tell patients before prescribing.  I take 300mg a day with 150mg of Wellbutrin.  I was ravenous for anything sweet until I started the wellbutrin. I have gained forty pounds that won't come off for anything.  I work out, eat right and still gain weight.  Very frustrating.....my moods are stable, but I get angry very easy towards the end of the day.  The best thing is no more anxiety.  I really need some advice to lose the weight.  I tried to ween myself off the seroquel slowly, but the nausea is overwhelming   help!

Seroquel good for:
Excellent Sedative, Controls Emotional Instability--which is exactly what it should do.
Bad:
irritability, shaking, withdrawal, weight gain, grogginess, forgetfullness, slight anger

I've been on and off and back on Seroquel since March '08. For someone like me who was suffering from paranoia, panic attacks, anxiety, and drasitic mood changes from being extremely happy to unbearably sad, the amount of sleep I was getting was about .8 hours per night.  My first dose of 50mg knocked me out within 20min.  I have never felt better. My doctor had me gradually step up to 200mg within a week and I honestly felt better aside from the grogginess. I had no mood swings, I wasn't feeling anxious, and best of all, my general fears subsided and I was able to gradually sleep without the light on. As a 26 year old woman, I was really happy about that last one. Those were the good things.  As for the not so great things, I realized that the reason I wasn't having those terrible feelings was because the Seroquel had me so tired, that I didn't have the chance to be worried, sad, or frightend. I would wake up and just be dragging. I also noticed that I was extremely thirsty, which I confused for hunger, thus the weight gain of 10lbs. But I was lucky enough to catch on to the weight gain factor and control that with plenty of water. BTW, it dries out your skin so if you have oily skin Seroquel is a plus! The worst side effect I've experienced is anger. Since being on this medication I become angry much easier than I used to.  In fact, I never used to get very angry, just sad.  Now I feel angry and irritated at small things.  I mentioned it to my doctor and told him I wanted to get off.  When I stopped taking it I experienced terrible withdrawal.  And this was only after a month of taking it.  nausea with vomiting, depression, etc. It was terrible.  I am now back on it to control my anxiety because I haven't been properly diagnosed.  "

By reading these posts that are the same situation as myself I am going to decrease my dose in half and take when I get home from work, not before I go to bed to try to alleviate these 2 side effects that I am experiencing. But for ME this med is wonderful. I am completely stress free and enjoy life in a totally new light in just one week of taking this med . So something tells me Im taking too high a dose for my body to handle. I will keep experimenting until I find the right dosage. I would also like to add that everyone is different . Not every med works the same for everyone. You shouldnt ""slam"" a drug if it doesn't work for you personally. It could be a life saver to someone else and their family."

My Dr. had me start with 50mg at bedtime and that first morning I could barely get out of bed. After another dose of 50mg the next day it wasn't as bad and on the 3rd night I increased it to 100mg. I was still having trouble with being sleepy for a few hours after getting up but the rest of the day was a big improvement in my mood. My wife even commeted on how I seemed to be doing better. My Dr. said I should try to work up to 200mg-300mg at bedtime so I incresed it to 150mg and the side effects didn't get any worse so I plan to go up to 200mg after a couple of more days at 150mg. I did notice that I seem to get the munchies throuogh out the day, but now that I'm more aware of the weight gain problem I've been able to resist the urge to eat and so I hope to avoid that problem. The overall benefit to this drug seems to be alot more calmness in my personality and and alot less anger and homocidial thouhgts. I think it is working well for me. I would recommend starting at the low doasge and slowly increasing until you get the results you need. It does tend to make you feel hung over the next day so I started taking earlier in the evening, like a couple of hours before bedtime and that seems to have resolved that problem as well.

I was diagnosed February my freshmen year of high school and they put me on Lamictal in June.  It treated some of my symptoms in the first month: extreme interest in sex, delusional thinking, depression, and others I can't even remember because they stopped.  But I added Seroquel last May (October now).  Stress and bad sleeping patterns set me off, and I am pretty good about recognizing when I am about to go through an episode or what state I am in.
       I take a dose of 150 Lamictal (2x a day), 200 Seroquel (2x day).  I was a little out of shape when I started Seroquel, so its side effects were strong, especially dizziness (I would sit down for a long time and when I got up, I lost my balance, couldn’t see because my vision would go white.  And I usually fell down or smacked into a wall, not fun…).  I don’t like the dizziness and this started the day after I began taking it.  Being in good physical shape can really help.   Seroquel also causes me to have episodes that I call panic attacks that started when I increased it.
     A trypical “panic attack”:  I have trouble thinking and functioning mentally.  I’m a vegetable.  And when I am trying to do a certain thing, like math, it frustrates me and then I loose it.  I start to cry, my breathing gets messed up, and I can’t put 2 and 2 together to save my life.  Someone will try to ask me a question and instead of answering, I start crying and breathing fast, my heart-rate skyrockets, I repeat phrases like “I don’t know” because I can’t think and I’m completely terrified.  This is set off by stress and a change in sleeping patterns.
        I’m not sure if Seroquel is a good thing even though my doctor thinks it is.  But even though my doctor disagrees, I can honestly pinpoint some bad things to this medication.  If it works for you, great, if it doesn’t, we might have something in common."

I take 600 mg at bedtime. It helps me sleep very well and all night. It also helps me with my mood. My depression was also lessened. Im not so mopey. But this medication can make you really ""out of it"". It's very hard to function after taking it. My heart races. And it makes me VERY hungry when it kicks in. It also makes it hard to communicate as well. If someone asks me something after taking it im very incoherent. I also don't remember things that I did while it's in my system. Like if someone calls you on your phone you answer it because of habit. But I can't really remember the phone call. My memory isn't the best either. I believe this med is the cause of it. In my opinion the side effects to me are not as important as how I feel and moods are a lot better. The side effects that i mentioned I have had for a long time. I have been on this medication now for 3 years. "

The side effects can affect your activity. Two hours after taking the drug I get really dopey or drugged. I can also have some dizziness or tremors in my hands. But, this does disappear after a few hours. I take most of this medication at bedtime. This drug has an amazing effect on your ""thinking."" It substantially improves your mood and encourages positive thinking. It really reduces or eliminates negative feelings or thinking.

However, I keep waking up in the middle of the night, at least 3 or 4 times.  It also seems to have made my rage worse.  Instead of having the rage building inside of me, I've been screaming and yelling and crying over my frustration.  I'm just confused about this medicine.  Maybe I need to give it more time or maybe I should just stop the medicine.

But I think it was interacting with the other meds iive been taking. I could have a medical condition or an allergic reaction because I am hungry after I take it for bed at night. I eat like a pig becuase it dropped my blood sugar and in the morning my arms were numb. My face numb around my mouth, My skin felt hot but it was cold. I was also taking wellbutrin at that time which must have made these reactions worse.  I am now on a low dose now 50 mg and feel less depressed, less numb, less weak and tired. I'M hoping to get off this med and on to something else maybe natural wise.  This medicine maybe given me hypoglycemia abnormally low blood sugar as I have learned I have been feeling more like crap than when I first started taking this shit medicine!! I also heard it may cause diabetes! something similar to Hypoglycemia. Symptoms are worse when I was taking antidepressant pills.  Hungry then tremors, then anxiety, sweats, fatigue/weakness.  I hope someone can relate to this because I want to know what is going on with my body. When I skip my meds I feel better!!!!! I told my doctor of my reactions.  He didn't believe that could happen? Sure.  He just wants to help the pharmacy make more money when we are getting sicker!!!! this makes me angry.  I would like some answers and facts about these meds because I get the negative side effects and heard of other people talking negatively about these meds, too.  Help get me a cure.  I can't work without feeling like crap weak in my muscles, number around my mouth and arms.  this is not healthy and I gotto stay on these meds until I see my doctor next time.  This is like torture and bullshit.

1895$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/26/2008 4:27:08 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$2$This medication has been quite effective in treating my depression and anxiety. One of the side-effects was unbearable when I first started it. Excessive tiredness, dizziness, and forgetfulness resulted from larger doses (300-400mg). I gave up on the medicaiton at first, but then I recently started to split the pills into 100 mg pieces and am taking them throughout the day. I can now handle the lower level of tiredness and I can actually stay awake and more alert, although I am also occasionally left to drinking caffenated drinks to help with my energey level.  Extreme tiredness(zombie-effect) appears to be a common side-effect. To combat this I suggest trying smaller doses and taking them throughout the day instead of once a day. In the two months since being on this I have seemed to have just recently built up a bit of a tolerance, thus the zombie-effect has lessened.  I have also gained 3-4 pounds  since starting this medication.  I seem to be hungry more often.  Watch out for this as well and try to start or continue exercising. I do get some other side-effects, however they are minor in comparison to the ones listed above.

I weened myself off of seroquel due to concerns...Now, I regret it...Seroquel really helped me with my anxiety...it made me less nervous in different situations and made me more comfortable with myself...and I kept my weight up....it also helped with my insomnia...Without it, I am a mess...the paranoia returned...I can't sleep again...(I am back on the adderall again) I was taking Straterra but, due to personal reasons like the seroquel I stopped taking it...I lost weight again because of the adderall...I was taking Lunesta to help me sleep but, I broke out in hives and my behavior and mood swings were worse than ever...I suffered loss of memory which never happens...Adderall is not meant for petite adults that are underweight...(I am perfectly healthy and eat like a horse...always have...I never had a eating disorder and I still don't) mental illness is a horrible thing...I suffered from panic attacks and anxiety since I was in grade school due to endless amount of harassment from classmates and teachers...I no longer have depression either...:)

I don't have the weight gain and it's the best night sleep ever! I have accidentally skipped a dose or two and couldn't sleep for a couple of days (50+hrs). I fall asleep fast and stay put for 9+ hrs. I did have a hard time at first w/waking but now I am learning to take it earlier (which is difficult, I work 2nd shift), and get up earlier.  I tend to stay awake the rest of the day as well.  No tiredness through out the day.  But if I take it and I am not in bed, I do tend to feel a bit ""drunk"". I did my homework a bit before taking.  I knew a lot of people said something about weight gain. So knowing that before hand, I curbed my normal eating habits and changed them into healthier choices.  I have increased my activity level as well.  All in all I have lost 12 lbs.  My moods have leveled.  I am a bit more organized. And I am trying to be a bit more hands on with my kids (ages 16 & 11).  I also picked up a hobby which normally I would never do.  I will write back if I have  down side, or an episode. I hope you found this helpful and I hope it helps you see a different side to this medication.  Good Luck."

I only weigh 102 lbs but instead of starting on low dosage I prescribed on a 100mg pill.  I was suppose to take it every morning with other medication.  I could not remember the day, I would pass out, in class, driving.  I try taking only 50mg but my day still had felt surreal. Eventually I decided to use it as a sleeping pill, it worked, but i never got up.  Or when I did get up I felt as though I was suffering from a hangover.

In a 1-2 wk. period (while in hospital) they brought her up to the full dose. (A psychiatrist at a good teaching hospital later told us the dose should have been built up to over a 3-5 month time span). When she went back to high school, she had what they call Word Loss where she would raise her hand to give her interpretation of a poem and she would have trouble expressing what she meant to say and it was very embarrassing for her. She almost got in an argument with the teacher and she is not the type to do that.
1950$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$8/16/2008 2:04:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$3$A couple weeks ago, I had a manic episode with psychotic features. I was on Geodon and Lithium when it occured. At the hospital I was tapered off of the Geodon and started on the seroquel. It wasn't until I had reached the 600mg at night dosage that I was able to finally sleep eight hours. However, I do wake up often during the night. I have been on the 600 mg dose for over a week and my psychotic symptoms are finally starting to fade. Because of Seroquel, I wake up drowsy, foggy, and have a dry mouth. Also, the severe perpetual hunger caused by the seroquel has just about driven me crazy. I am determined not to gain weight on Seroquel so I am toughing out the hunger and watching what I eat for the three meals a day I do eat. So in summary, the seroquel took a little while to accomplish its task and its side effects are bothersome. I am hoping that the side effects will disapear once I become accustomed to this drug. I don't know how long that is going to take because with Geodon it took three to four months before the side effects disapeared. I don't know if I can be severely hungry for that long.

1968$Condition: Other$7/28/2008 10:13:29 PM$Reviewer: Stacy , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$"My doctor prescribed this to me after no results with other sleeping medications such as Lunesta & Ambien. I am not bipolar so I was very hesitant to take this when reading the drugs ""use""- I'd consulted with other people who have taken/are taking it and it did not hear too many good things. I wish I stuck with my gut instinct, I took Seroquel for less than 2 weeks and my depression worsened, suffered from depersonalization (which had never occurred before), I felt nervous/shaky without physically shaking, and zombie-like and very negative. I noticed that I had trouble handling small problems, I took them as the end of the world. I also noticed that my blood circulation was impaired, my hands would go numb, more so right when I'd woke up. I can tell it has still not left my system, I just don't feel like myself. I know this is a good medication, it is just not the right drug for me and I feel it was prescribed in bad judgment to me especially with hypertension. I also gained nearly 7 lbs in the two weeks."

1972$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/26/2008 4:52:39 PM$Reviewer:  Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$Thank god for this drug. I finally have received the help I need. It took my new doctor a while to find the right dosing for me. The lower the dose, the more I would sleep. The higher the dose the better normal sleep I have had. My depression and self esteem and life control is much better. It took many psychiatrists to finally figure it out. None of them completely understood all the past meds I was on and the weight gain I experienced on all of them. The uncontrolled movements with all the other drugs. With this drug he told me first few weeks I would feel sedated, but that it would pass. Told me to ONLY take it at night couple of hours before bed, watch my diet, eat better as most drugs have you gain weight.

I eat excessive amounts of it so im a lil scared of the diabetic side affect so im trying to watch that but all in all I really like this medicine because I feel good about myself. No more mood swings and being mean and whatnot. The suicide thoughts are GONE. I feel great. Still tired for bout 2 hours in the morning after taking it but for my happiness back ill deal with that.

That night was the FIRST night I slept more than 2 hours total in 14 months! I actually slept for 10 hours, and I rested, not just closed my eyes. I had been going, non stop, for 4 and 5 days in a row with a max of 4 hours of sleep TOTAL! It has been a life saver for me! I did find out the hard way, though, don't take seroquel and codeine at the same time... I took a teaspoon of cough syrup with codeine when I was sick and my pulse was BOUNDING and at 155bpm for over 3 hours. I fell asleep convinced I was not going to wake up. MY husband sat up and checked my pulse constantly for HOURS... It finally came down to 110 after 6 hours. NEVER AGAIN!!! I was given 100mg to take but I MUST have 12 hours to devote to sleeping if I take that much.  I get by with 8 hours with taking 50mg. It seriously saved my life, and my marriage... I'm not quite as moody and ""snappy"" because I'm not exhausted."

First, 200mg a night, then down to 25mg a night and then up to 50mg a night, I stopped it and tried to switch to Topamax---BIG mistake. Topamax made me very ill. For the last two weeks I was having severe abdominal pain, which no diagnostic test could diagnose - abdominal and vaginal ultrasound. I couldn't eat. I stopped the Topamax per physician's orders, and just started back on 50mg of Seroquel at night. Today was the first day in a very long time my stomach did not hurt as bad - meaning this medication works for my ANXIETY, my IBS. I was wondering why I was becoming so restless and irritable during the days, I think I finally figured out that Seroquel helps my anxiety and I take 50mg for sleep. I tend to be an addict, so will not take Lunesta, Ambien or the like. I also take Suboxone and Librium, and I have been able to cut down on the Librium since starting back on Seroquel, it really helps my PTSD symptoms in the morning - I was wondering why I was getting panic attacks when I woke up - - because the Seroquel had been out of my 'system' for over 2 months. The only thing I worry about is that my heart tends to beat irregular, and now my physician believes I am pre - diabetic. I could lose a good 30 Lbs., but I also eat tons of veggies and ride my bike as much as possible. I do not sit and watch soap operas and eat Ding Dongs. I haven't gained much weight from Seroquel, my eating sugar is to blame for my weight gain. Interesting how I had to play doctor to find out why I was feeling so horrible - I thought I had something seriously wrong with my abdominal pain. Still not sure what effect this medication has on our hearts.....

I have been taking it for 10 years, so the major dip in blood pressure and immediate need to lie down 15 min. after taking my evening dose of 150mg has stopped. It has kept me calm and non-violent and the inability to see things objectively is gone. Nothing is a wonder drug. If you have Borderline Personality Disorder I would suggest Dialectical Behavior Therapy as well a drug therapy. I feel so much more able to blend in with society rather than feeling paranoid and angry and blaming it all on others.

Started at 75 and currently at 800 mg spread out daily. Mania and depression are both aided satisfactorily. Side effects that were part of Zyprexa are drastically lessened: increased appetite, hypersomnia, and cognitive hindrance are wonderfully diminished in comparison. Nasal congestion has been a significantly annoying problem, particularly with sleep. Tiredness is also noticeable, but not worse than with Zyprexa. Strangely, effects can be erratic: a dosage that often quickly puts to sleep can have a much more muted effect the night afterwards and has required me to take 50-100% more to fall asleep, without the presence of caffeine, chocolate or other stimulants. This odd inconsistency has been constant since day one of taking it.

You do not have to give your child a medication that you do not think is right for your child. Your child is not in danger (like a child with juvenile diabetes who you dont help administer insulin, that IS prosecutable, youre scenario is not) If your doctor is not listening you need, absolutly need to switch doctors asap. you have to be extremely careful with what you put in your body. My husband whos 26 is still paying the price for medications he took when he was a child. They were new and innovative and didn't know the long term effects, well... now he's suffering from them.  If you feel something is wrong, do something about it. Get someone to listen. You only have one body. and you have to speak up for your childs.

2110$Condition: Other$4/8/2008 10:41:34 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) $2$1$1$My 17 y.o. daughter was on this med for nearly a year.  Dr's had maintained the benefits out weigh the side effects.  Not so in her case.  She has what we are told may be irreversible tremors.  She had severe loss of appetite and nauseau, which in turn she responded by refusing this med on many occasions.  She was admitted to a different facility and they immediately stopped Seroquel and began Risperdal-M, a disintegrating tablet and also Cogentin to combat the tremors. It is important to keep in mind that bad side effects play an important role in treating disorders, especially in teens when these side effects are visual to others and they are prone to reject meds if they associate negative experiences with treatment. Listen to your loved ones concerns regarding their treatment and know that ill side effects can outweigh the benefits.  There are other options.

2116$Condition: Bipolar Depression$4/2/2008 3:27:40 PM$Reviewer: Nay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I was diagnosed with Bipolar II in August 2008. I had severe aggravation, anxiety, couldn't relax, insomnia, irrated easily, most of the time isolated and couldn't work to boot. I went to a psychiatric nurse practioner and she started putting me on Lamictal and klonapin for sleep. After two times trying Seroquel, the second time was the better. I think the Lamictal had to balance my mood first and my body got used to that way of functioning, more calm. My sleep is much better, can sleep through the night at 50mg at bedtime. I feel so relaxed during the day and more confident I can get through my days. Not inhaling alot to relax. No weight gain yet, but I am excercising regularly and eating right. Please don't give up on medications as Seroquel might be helpful especially with sleep. You,ll know right away with the sleep. I know we are all different and we all need different dosages or meds. but it's nice to know that Seroquel works fast for sleep and in my case three days to see the calmness. I have read so many reviews, and thank you to all who have helped me find Seroquel with yuor inspiring stories.

I slept for almost 24/7. I started on the starter pack (25 mgs, then 100, then 200, then finally 300 mgs) at night time. When I was awake I was a monster!!! I flipped out over anything and everything! I was in constant state of panic/anxiety and paranoid beyond belief. I had no appetite what-so-ever. A week later had gone by after starting this medication I was on the phone with my dad and I felt like I was a magnet and my entire body felt like it was going to puddle onto the floor. I got off the phone with him, called the ER and told them what was going on. They told me to tell the person who put me on the med to take me off and to find something else. My heart felt like it was going to explode. I collapsed on the bed and passed out. I woke up sometime later and found myself not being able to move, talk, nothing! I could hear my heart. It was so slow it was pausing at times. I was scared as hell. I couldn't move, but I had tears freely falling from my face. Woke up hours later, went to a counseling appt (not the nurse that gave me the med). She saw how I was and was amazed at what that med did to me. My speech was slow, it gave me amnesia (i honestly had convo's on my cell and never knew i had them!!!!) It was a horrible experience and will NEVER go back to that drug again!!!!! 
2140$Condition: Bipolar Depression$3/17/2008 9:12:47 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was on 300 mg for bipolar/anxiety/sleep but I was still very anxious.  My doctor told me to do 450mg.  I did that for a couple weeks but then my doctor thought the Seroquel was adding to the anxiousness so he took me off it completely.  That was a huge mistake.  I did not sleep until he put me back on it.  I was also more anxious again.  When he put me back on it mainly for sleep he told me to take 300mg and if that didn't help to take another 300mg.  This drug has helped me in many ways.  It is very sedating so I only take it at night.  I sleep very soundly, too.  My husband will come home from work at midnight and we will have a conversation.  I won't remember a word of it the next day.  This is a side effect that I am more than willing to live with, though.

Always question your doctor about what they are using this medication for(diagnosis) and request that you start low & graually go up as needed. As a patient you have a right to ask questions. If the doctor gets offened, then you need a new doctor. I left a program because I felt the doctors were not listening, but always telling. Now I will find a new program. I do recommend education via mental health facilities. You will learn more at a facility than at most doctors offices, unless you find the best doctor ever, but don't count on it!

It is more of a tranquilizer than a sleep aid. I sleep 8-10 hrs and am still groggy for hours in the AM. I am confused and have memory issues since on this. My Dr is dismissis of the labwork that is supposed to be done every 3 months or so, so I insist on it, while I try to find another Dr.

Thanks to the person who mentioned the sleep eating! I began doing that suddenly and did not know it was the Seroquel.
I would not recommend this drug and want to get off of it, although I don't know how I'll sleep.

I used to be a trim size four but as a result of the medication and the increase in appetite, I am now a size ten. Though it does help me sleep, it sometimes make me feel dizzy and nauseaus. If I happen to get up in the middle of the night, I bump into things. Recently while getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, I hit my head,but I was so groggy I didn't realize I had hurt myself. 

My vision has blurred, I sometimes get pain in my body when I'm sleeping and I wake up in the morning feeling sluggish and drugged. On some days I have such a hard time shaking the fogginess off that I am completely withdrawn.
Additonally it has made me severely constipated.
 Also with the weight gain, I'm extremely concerned about becoming diabetic. My mother was bi-polar too and she became diabetic from her medication-a year after acquiring diabetes she passed away. It's extremely frusterating to have to choose between your mental health and your physical well being. I'm sure that seraquel works fine for some, but it is not a medication I would recommend."

Seroquel has been the med that has given me the most competent help so far, as being able to live my life in  what one would consider the highest quality terms of every day living. As compared to any other med I've used. 
Yes, there are some effects one must watch, as Seroquel does have the tendecy to cause an excitement of the Pancreous. One can adjust to this possible deficency, by the avoidance in consumtion of the amounts of sweets and or sugar one uses.
This is benefit to the overall health for the person who is currently using Seroquel, as excess sugars are a huge problem in our diets today as a whole. Any elimination of such excess sugars is a win/win senario with one who is currently using Seroquel.
If one continues to use excessive amounts of sugars in their diets, this can have the effective disabling of ones pancreatic functions by leading to Diabetic conditions, which are as I noted earlier easily avoided by strictly limiting your sugar intake."

Moreover, it gave me constant headaches, slow (but persistent) weight gain, and, perhaps most importantly, it made me sleep all day, which rendered my totally dysfunctional.  I have found Abilify (surprising, I know) and Zyprexa to be much better at treating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and, most importantly, allowing me to operate at a high level of functionality.  Given that all the anti-psychotics work differently, it's worth a try, but I have found Abilify and Zyprexa to be superior drugs.  In Seroquel's defense, however, I have heard that (for most people) the sleepiness wears off after a few weeks; it just didn't for me.  I would talk to your doctor and do some research about the other anti-psychotics (Abilify, Geodon, Risperdal, and Zyprexa) before taking Seroquel.  Lastly, be careful at first b/c you will not be able to drive or operate machinery &c. &c.

I also experienced extreme ""hangover"" from this,,, extreme lethargy and not energy or motivation. I now take 25 milligrams... it is great for insomnia, for other issue with mental diseases, I see how it could shut off the brain and kill that race of thoughts in the mind while you are trying to fall asleep.

don't think I like this though. Good luck to those that it works for or for those trying it for the first time."

My life has changed so dramatically, in a good way!I can process info,am not in a state of panic and self loathing, and confusion.Now that my thinking has cleared up, i must face the crazy things i did in the past,and the troubles i have had all my life, it is very difficult and sad.My illness ran my life before, not me.I am grateful that i can now stand back and really think about things ,big or small, the medicine allows me to have the luxury that""normal"" people have all the time.I am 55 and for the first time in my life i get to hear the words in songs I've heard for 50 years, so simple yet a profoundly different experience,as i was never able to comprehend even such basic stuff before.The ""psychotic"" stuff has slowed down too. It's great to be able to sleep every night.I tried easing up on the effexor, but immediately had the constant body pains that i had all my life, so the combo is what works.I no longer have  my physical,emotional and mental life filled with confusion and pain.Weight gain has been the biggest problem, i have gone from 150 to 180!!!,a dry mouth, and receding gums concern me.Also a series of skin infections on my feet continuously.I sometimes have bad heartburn, but perhaps this is also due to weight gain.I am rarely sick, have fewer colds or headaches than before.I cannot take the summer heat, and find that sweating comes with any physical exertion at all.I am concerned about raised sugar levels, I seem to crave sweets.I also am thirsty a lot.And finally, the price is outrageous-$760 for one of the seoquel prescriptions. My health ins. does not pay for scripts, but was the only ins.I could find that covered mental health.My health ins. is my biggest monthly expense, more than house etc.It is clearly discriminatory for those of us needing meds and mental health coverage.Despite the side effects, I cannot imagine living without it."

I've had one panic attack in two weeks, two ""manic"" episodes in a month lasting less than a day each, and my depressive days have been cut dramatically! If you're looking for a miricle drug, there isn't one. This isn't for everyone. It can't work for everyone-- nothing can. It sucks, get over it.

Personally, I would recommend Seroquel as an alternative to Zyprexa for anybody. The side effects are a bit similar, but not nearly as acute or inhibiting. If you're considering Zyprexa for a psychiatric disorder, Seroquel is probably a much wiser choice. It's a more advanced drug, and it doesn't impair your cognitive abilities or motivation like the older ones do. It will increase your appetite, but I've found that side effect to decrease over time. The biggest problem, though, is that it will be very hard for you to wake up the first few mornings as your system gets used to it.

I take 100mg before bed and actually sleep whereas before I'd frequently go days without rest. Higher dosages gave me severe RLS and had me feeling cold one minute and hot the next. It also made my eyes extremely sensitive to light. On the 100mg dosage my 2 complaints are weight gain of around 30 pounds and a strange congestion of my upper sinuses that leaves me breathing through my mouth at night.If I forget to take a dose I will not sleep at all. I'm scared of the possibility of this medication causing diabetes as my father is a brittle diabetic. I eat very low fat meals, little sweets and drink only diet soda which has kept my blood sugar levels normal so far. "

I have currently been on 600mg for about 13 months.  I went from being a hopeless 30+ year alcoholic (apparently self medicating bi-polar II), with frequent in-patient treatments, to a recovering alcoholic sober for over a year now.  I have no doubt that Seroquel saved my life.  I went from the brink of suicide to the most ""together"" I've felt in my 53 years.  The only thing different with my alcoholic treatment strategy this time was the Seroquel.  I've noticed a couple of posts saying Seroquel has some ""street value"" for drug abuse.  Hmmm....I would think that is the case only if you wanted to SLEEP on the street.  This stuff puts you in snooze mode, so take it before bed.  I have noticed absolutely no surreal or “feeling high” characteristics.  It does give you hunger fits, so you need to religiously follow Doctor's instructions and get regular blood work to test glucose levels, cholesterol and triglycerides.  You also need to work a responsible weight maintenance program.  Not too hard to do when your head is screwed on straight like Seroquel has done for me.  My anxiety level went from an extremely high level to what I perceive as low.  The world is now a pretty good place to live.  I should note that I am also on 325mg Effexor XR (SSRI) per day (past 5 years) and have no idea if the combination has somehow given me outstanding results. All I can say is Seroquel RULES for me.  Your mileage may vary."

I would be up all night and sleep in the day. I guess you could say I was nocturnal. I had pretty much dealt with that for years, though. I was diagnosed Bipolar without the extreme manic episodes. This medicine is not bad, I had no problems except sleepiness, and extreme hunger. This is technically an anti-phychotic drug, but popular and used quite frequently. I would suggest starting out on a very small dose, say 25 mg. & work up from there. I was taking 300 mg a day, but then stopped the medicine for a while, and now use occasionally at night. 25 mg knocks me out now. You do get used to it in higher doses if you up your mgs slowly and take it everyday. But, beware of the side effect of hunger because if it's not nailed down YOU WILL EAT IT! (oh, but not so bad in small doses)

My wife reported this to the doctor who was sure that this would abate after I used seroquel for a period of time.  Luckily my wife looked up diskenesia on the web and found that it could become permanent.  After a few more weeks of symptoms she insisted that the doctor return me to haldol.  In a matter of days the Targive symptoms started to disappear.  I am no longer going to change my effective treatments for new drugs pushed by ill informed doctors.
2389$Condition: Other$10/17/2007 4:53:33 PM$Reviewer: up all night, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$5$"I have severe tnnitus ,a high pitched sound  24/7. Along with Labyrinthitis for the past 22 months. I cannot sleep because of the loud sounds .I have been on almost every drug to help me sleep. My Dr. started me on Seroquel 100mg. along with 15 mg. Flurazepam I just had 2 nights of sleep,then 2 nights of on and off sleep.
I had 1 full week of no sleep at all in May,when we tried Rozerum. I was so sleep deprived I could not even stand up on my own. Being only 102 lbs. and 48 yrs. old I want something to work for me. It has been really hard on my husband and our 2 children. My Dr. says we might have to up the dose to 200mg. to sleep. I can only hope a larger dose will do it for me. It is so hard to function when you are sleep deprived. I have done vestibular rehab therapy with a physical therapist for the past 20 months.My vertigo and dizzy, nausea, and walking and normal daily life has changed drastically.Symptoms are worse with less sleep, I hate living this way, but it could be worse, so I need to try just about anything.Hypnosis didn't work either."

I started at 50mg but needed a dose increase after about 1.5 years. I've noticed that 100mg still puts me to sleep but doesn't give me that ""whoa"" feeling when it kicks in like it used to, and also takes longer to kick in. But it still works for me when nothing else has. I tried ambien at 10mg but it took 50mg (over the course of a few hours) to barely put me to sleep for 4 hours. I also tried trazedone which had the opposite effect, and some samples of Lunesta which were too weak. Given all this I'm not even going to bother with Rozerem. NOTHING puts me to sleep and keeps me asleep like Seroquel. It has been a lifesaver. I've gained a little weight but that's because when the drowsy kicks in, hunger kicks in as well (side effect). But I'm just lazy and give in to the hunger without considering other options to curb the hunger, or consuming less fattening foods before sleep.

Note to people reading this for insomnia! Most general practitioners have little/no experience with this drug, and won't feel at all comfortable prescribing it for insomnia (let alone what it's intended for). You will most likely need to see a psychiatrist for a Rx. To a psychiatrist, this drug at a low dose (~100mg which is plenty to sleep for most people) is no big deal to them. I never heard of this when it was prescribed to me so I did some searching on google. I read some horror stories with the drug (mostly weight gain) and didn't even want to take it but when it knocked me out the first night, I haven't skipped a night since. Most of the horror stories you'll find are the exception and not the rule. Talk to your psychiatrist and they will most likely confirm this."

He does not have a weight problem, actually he is a bit below average.  The dose I give him makes him lethagic (it is meant to) so he can sleep.
