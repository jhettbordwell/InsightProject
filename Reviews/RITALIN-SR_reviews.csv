3$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/15/2012 9:00:20 AM$Reviewer: skysouldier, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$1$1$I was on ritalin xr 20mg three times a day and it would still wear off. I slept fine but it took three months for me to realize it had made me so efficient that everyone else was just in my way... I started getting very aggravated and had severe headaches when it wore off. It definitely helped me focus and deal with the scattered thoughts of add/adhd but the side effects became not worth it. When my friends started asking why I was so cranky all the time I started to worry and took myself off it. I had a very add week but no headaches or irritability issues. I am now on vyvanse and so far it seems to be treating my symptoms with no major side effects. It calms me down, and I don't feel irritable, also I do not have headaches when it wears off. The only thing is, after reading many reviews, it seems very bad for small children. Also, the first day I took it I forgot to eat. So I now eat three meals a day, hungry or not. I hope this helps with your add experience if you are un-medicated I am sure you stopped reading after the first three words...

11$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/20/2010 11:09:36 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $2$3$3$I have been on various varieties of ADD meds. This one, my Generic LA Ritalin seems to be not nearly as effective as was my brand Concerta LA (it was far too expensive for me}.I don't know what an average dose is but 2 #20's in Am AND 1 #20 mid afternoon doesn't cut it.  I was told originally to take all 3 in the AM.  This doesn't work for me, but don't know what to do. Also, sometimes it says Methefenadate and sometimes Methalyn! What's the difference?

Sustained release however it is not! It is a quick hit for a few hours and that's it. It cost more that the regular Ritalin but no additional benefits in my opinion

18$Condition: Other$6/3/2009 4:16:05 PM$Reviewer: bells, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$I went to my doctor complaing of excessive sleepiness. No matter how much i slept or took care of my health i needed naps to get through the day and was always tired. I also tested positive for ADHD but not very bad. The short acting ritalin was a roller coaster and I ended up sleepier. This isnt a cure all but it definitely is great to have to help me through the day.
