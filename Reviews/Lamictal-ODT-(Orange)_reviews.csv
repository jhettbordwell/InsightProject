3$Condition: Fit$2/16/2012 7:07:28 PM$Reviewer: Susa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"I have been on Lamictal for 8 years. I started it for mild seizures. It works. I also notice I am less anxious. I have no side effects. It does not change my thinking, as a anti-depressant would. I still have to work on my ""stuff"" baggage. It slows me down enough to do that.it is not a miracle drug. It does not numb you, you must do the work. Several of my friends with Bi-Polar are also on it with success. "

5$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/18/2011 9:38:13 AM$Reviewer: Tryinghard, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$5$I am on my second week with this medication. Perhaps this isn't long enough. I find that I am having mood swings. Dr. never said I was bipolar. Since adding it to my other meds at night I am sleeping solid but have a hard time shaking it off in the morning.

I dont feel so overwhlemed by my emotions or just rage out over little things. I feel normal i have energy and am sleeping much better. I think it works great. 
7$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/1/2011 11:11:20 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I have been on this med for about 2 mos.  Have not seen any improvement, in fact, symptoms seem to be increasing.   It is very easy to use and does not leave an after taste, however, don't feel benefit is worth continuing.
8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/22/2010 12:47:44 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been on this medication for about 6 weeks now. I am so glad that I am. I haven't been cycling, or depressed since about week 2. I am still able to feel really happy, or really sad, or angry, with sufficient reason. But they are rational reactions rather than me just going off into a cycling mood without cause.

10$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$5/11/2010 9:20:32 PM$Reviewer: [emailÂ protected], 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$This medicine is for my daughter that just turned 13th at the end of April. She has Autism and ADHD and has been having seizures and the doctors don't know why. When they run the test nothing shows up but this medicine works really good for her. She is even doing better in school. The only bad thing is it cost so much money and have to keep fighting insurance company to get it
