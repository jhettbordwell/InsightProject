1$Condition: Repeated Seizures with Unconsciousness Between Episodes$6/23/2012 7:47:24 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$5$3$I love this med for my seizures. Of course, I only use it when absolutely necessary. The needle part is thin enough to not hurt too badly and it ends my seizures pretty quickly. Only down part is it takes a bit longer for me to regain consciousness and go back to normal life. Overall, it's never harmed me.
2$Condition: Anxious$11/6/2010 4:30:55 PM$Reviewer: [emailÂ protected], 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have taken this medication over the years to deal with my ""needle phobia"" when I needed to have blood drawn or IV's started.  4 - 6 pills, under doctor's supervision, is usually what it took.  Most recently, I have been able to face bloodwork without being medicated and I feel that it is because I have been able to become ""desensitised"".  I still take the med for IV's.  Having tried several kinds of therapy in my life and even begged to be held down for my marriage blood work to be drawn, I agreed to try anxiety medications.  This is, by far, the best for me.  I take it an hour before the sched ""needle time"" and usually hit the height of the medication's effects at approx. an hour and a half after taking the pills.  
I credit Lorazepam with helping me experience enough blood draws comfortably that I no longer need it for that and hope to reach that point with IV's, too. "
