In fact it is causing other issues....like I am super ill and snap with little control of myself. It doesn't just limit my talking... I don't want to talk at all.... and I don't want to hear anyone else talk either.... not even on tv. And I am suppose to take it 2 times a day....well the second time I can't even remember if I took it or not. And it doesn't help me focus.... instead I kind of zombie out and don't think at all... I just stare. It makes me ill and paranoid....I miss my adderall
4$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/30/2011 8:28:31 PM$Reviewer: DawnB, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$5$My son is 10 years old and has been taking Ridalin since he was 6 years old along with 36mg of Concerta in the morning. His origial doseage was 5mg twice a day once at 4PM and again at 7PM however last year I spoke with our family DR and informed him that it seemed as though at times it made it to where he could not go to sleep he would lay there in bed and stare at the ceiling or mess around for 3-4 hours after going to bed so we decided to cut out the 7PM dosage. However, he still has this problemm at times. I have also noticed that there are times that this medicine seems to help and then other times he still bounces off the wall so I have had mixed feelings about it. I am thinking it is time to re-evaluate him and maybe try something differant.

6$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/9/2010 3:45:40 PM$Reviewer: John, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$2$"My Presciption 40mgs/day (I only take 20-30 though)

After taking this medication for a month now, it has been very good for me so far. The first week being on this med I was skeptical, and it didn't seem to be working very well, but I decided to go a couple more weeks, to see what happens. 

It seems like once I got to my 3rd week the Ritalin started working better, I know people say it is a stimulant, so it should work immediantley, but I think people don't understand that although it works the first time it may not work right till your body gets used to it. 


Here are my pros and cons of it so far:

Pros: 
-Better Focus, yeah I still get distracted from time to time, but It's WAY easier to focus and concentrate.
-My Vision looks sharper, almost like how a T.V. is when you turn up the contrast. 
-Better a video games... Hey I'm a college student this stuff is important too lol.
-Slightly more sociable, a little less shy
-I feel more like a ""Normal"" person

Cons: 
-Slightly increased heart rate 72bpm to 80-90bpm
-I get irrated easier
-Occasional mild depression when it is wearing off
-Desire to take more, it's scary (I DO NOT do this though)
-Decreased Appetite



If you're on this med, don't be too quick to judge, give it a month and see if it starts working better."

8$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$3/8/2010 5:23:03 PM$Reviewer: sinkingintograce, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$4$I've been taking it for a month, and the first week it was amazing.  I could concentrate on everything, and my mood was even better.  Now though, only a month later I can't even tell when I don't take it other than when I don't I feel more moody, less happy.  Not helping the ADD anymore, and my mood wasn't this bad before.  I feel like my mood depends on this drug and I don't like that.  
9$Condition: Depression$3/8/2010 3:06:39 PM$Reviewer: Livinv&#39;LifeNow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Just hit the 1 month mark of this medicine and it has TOTALLY given my life back.  I was severely depressed and on cymbalta and Geodon. My husband felt he was slowly losing me and that I would commit suicide, which is how I felt. I am living life now and can't stand to be in bed. I am just scared that it will stop being effective someday.  I take 2-10mg pills in the morning and keeps me going all day and the plus is that I have lost 10lbs this first month.I was ready to give up hope, until I took my own life in my hands and asked the doctor for specific meds. to try. First one was ADDERALL which didn't work. Then I asked for Rittalin which he happily gave me.  Now I don't even have to see him as much.My advice is research your own health, ask the doctors to keep prescribing different meds. until you get it right! Don't just accept it, fight for it ...it's your life!!

18$Condition: Depression$11/17/2008 6:50:43 PM$Reviewer: Steve R R, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$5$"AN OPTION for some:Methylphenidate is one of the pills the Docs put me on to help alertness during the day. NOTE: I do not have ADHA !. The alertness problem is probably caused by other meds along with a ""thing"" they call DEPRESSION. IMPORTANT: I WAS ON PROVIGIL FOR ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE MY INSURER PULLED IT.  Provigil maintained a steady, even, alertness (not a high) all day for me and wore off in the evening. I had very little insomnia . AND PROVIGIL DID NOT PRODUCE ADDITIONAL ANXIETY in my case.  Methylphenidate is to much like coffee, going up and down, up and down, and it's hard to find correct doses for an acceptable result. Also, my experience is that a TOLERENCE to Methylin occurs FAST. My Doctor warned me about this. A few times a month I radically lower the dose and go through some rotten withdrawal on purpose. Otherwise tolerence develops quickly over about 4-8 days and the methylphenidate's effectiveness, in my case would require increasing dosages(very bad news). With PROVIGIL, tolerance was negligible. If you are looking for that which helps alertness along with better concentration (how can one concentrate well when one is just about to fall asleep?)...if you can afford it, try to ask your Doc to let you try Provigil.  For me and my health situation PROVIGIL was far far superior to  METHYLPHENIDATE (AKA RITALIN), and if I could afford it, I would revert to Provigil and I am trying to find some $ to offset the cost differential.  My doctor agrees and actully apologized that I was going from that which worked very well, to an inferior med solution (FOR MY PARTICULAR CASE).

HEY OUT THERE ... May your health improve no matter what, and may we all arrive at a point where we need no pills or any medicine to thrive.

When I'm not feeling so bad sometimes I can get by with a nap during the day, but my energy level is always low. When the Chronic Fatigue kicks in, sometime I will stay in bed for 4-5 days just falling in and out of sleep. When that happens I usually am awake only about 6 hours per day. My doctor prescribed this drug to help me stay awake, but at 5mg I don't think it is doing anything. Does anyone else have any additional experience as a patient with this drug for a similar condition?

I have been on many many anti-depressants. The medication that helped me the most was Methylin Oral. I was passed on to many Doctors way too often and began to feel like a guini pig so I stopped  believing in mental health drugs all together. 
Thank you so much for listening, I would like to hear from someone who believes in me.

I didn't sleep for two days, my heart was pounding, and I felt drugged the entire time. It forces your brain to use up its neurotransmitters and then when you stop you crash. It is so odd that everyone knows that meth amphetamine is bad for you but if your doc writes an Rx for a stimulant drug like this then it is okay?
