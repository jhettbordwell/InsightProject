1$Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/29/2019 3:17:30 PM$Reviewer: Madmac, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I’ve been on sertraline a little over a year now and I’m generally happy with the drug. I’ve had depression and anxiety as long as I can remember but since starting sertraline i’ve been more motivated and have less suicidal ideations. I have a few side effects, most notably restlessness, especially in my legs, when I try to sleep or sit still. It’s always been an issue for me, but the drug has certainly made it worse in that regard. Otherwise, I’m doing pretty well. Hope you are too.

13$Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/25/2018 1:47:41 PM$Reviewer: Eli James, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $2$1$3$I took this medication and it was by far the worst antidepressant I have ever tried. It didn't work at all. I had persistent panic attacks while on every single dose. I had to change my dose around 5 times, each one of them not showing any improvement. I don't recommend this for anyone who has multiple disorders and is being told to treat them all with this. I was told this would help with my OCD, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and body dysmorphia. This medication made me feel worthless because it was so ineffective.

I had exactly those side effects you described from one particular brand.  It was Tillomed.  They set me back a long way.  My doctor gave me a new prescription so I could request a different brand.  I've found both Crescent Pharma and Aurobindo to be excellent brands, both in 50mg.  Some teeth clenching, and my sex drive is flat, but otherwise my physical and mental health is bright.  Now into my 5th month.  Have been told I'm being weaned off soon.  Fingers crossed.

I realise now that I was depressed and had attacks of anxiety for many years thinking I was normal. More recently (2-3 years) I have been very angry, cry at silly things, not wanting to go out, very negative, memory loss It got to the point where I thought I was going mad.  My husband made me go to the doctors.  I finally gave in and I haven't looked back.  I feel fantastic. No more crying, feel amazing.  Happy to socialize.  I never want to come off of them.  They are a life saver!

It works extremely well when it is taken consistently, but if you are on a high dose like I was and missed even one pill it can send you into a downward spiral. As far as helping with overall anxiety it has helped tremendously but situations sometimes still can send me into major anxious fits.

I had never had this drug previously. After my very first dose, 2 hours later a woke from a nap and shortly after had an intense panic attack. I DO NOT have a history of panic attacks, but I've experienced the very initial onset of them so I was aware of this building feeling. Usually this onset feeling has not lasted more than 30 secs, but this time it came on within 30 secs into a full blown panic attack. Had I not recognized what is was I would have called EMT. Attack lasted 30 mins. I had 2 more of these attacks before bedtime and never came down from the last one. I was awake all night feeling like I was constantly on the edge of having a panic attack.

Sertraline (Zoloft) has made a huge impact on my life, including helping me sleep and enjoy my hobbies again.

I was still experiencing racing thoughts, and anxiety.  Nervousness, butterflies in my stomach.  It did make me happier in a sense and helped my social anxiety, however it made me extremely tired mid-day every day. (Taken in the morning) Fatigue almost, with tired feeling and later I felt more depressed than I have ever felt. It also made me VERY nauseous to the point that I felt like I had the urge to throw up inside of my throat. 
Side effects: Dry Mouth."
518$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/21/2019 4:35:17 AM$Reviewer: E, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$2$1$Started 25mg because of a breakup and job loss. I didnt think I needed an antidepressant like Zoloft, but the Dr. recommended it. First week was hell; insomnia, diareah,no appetite and still anxious. 2nd week getting better with the shits and appetite coming back. If you drink alcohol while on it, prepare for a horrible next day as far as being depressed. Everyone is different and Im not sure I need this, so I drank a few nights while on it, and it didnt kill me. Most days it makes me not sleep, so I drink a sleepytime tea. Im only 2 weeks in on this Zoloft, and I also have .5 lorazepam I can take also. That puts me out within 1 hr. Most people on this thread seem like they benefit from this because they have a lifelong struggle with depression, which is great if it works. Maybe I will see a change in another 2 weeks, but I think these first 2 weeks is too soon to judge it. I would say give it the 4-6 week range Dr's tell you and maybe you'll feel better. As far as alcohol...stay the hell away from it unless you wanna feel like complete ass the next day, feel more depressed than when you started this med and possibly do horrible damage to your liver. Ask me in 6 months

I don't eat and when I do I get nausea, except I crave salt. I bruise easily, which is bad because my equilibrium seems to be off. Bump into things a lot now. Dizziness; my head feels as if someone is squeezing it. Pretty much just general lethargic. But since I have no serious symptoms my dr says I need to continue. Not sure how long I can function this way.

571$Anxiousness associated with Depression$11/29/2016 1:29:00 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$So I have only been on Zoloft for a week, not sure why I am giving a rating right now, because I have been told by my doctor that I won't get the full effectivness until 4 weeks in, but I am still going to give a review.  I suffer from anxiety and some depression.  I am taking 50 mg once a day.  I am always tired, and it's a fight to keep my eyes open during the day at work.  My attitude is calmer,which is nice, but sometimes I catch myself staring out into outer space (if you get my drift), maybe it's because of being so tired.  I also am experiencing dry mouth.  I notice I perk up close to the time I have to take my next pill.  Not sure if this is how I want to feel, tired all the time.  Unmotivated really, I went from doing everything to do nothing or not wanting to do much.  LOL, can't win.  Anyways, I try it out for the full month and make up my mind at the end of 4-5 fews if I want to pursue.

I had problems way before going but it seems things got worse when I returned. I couldn't even get my haircut without getting a panic attack and just having to sit there with crazy thoughts in my head while trying to maintain small talk.  I started avoiding situations all together, sitting in a classroom seemed unbearable.  I would experience a panic attack probably once a week which would trigger a deep depression.  I thought once I had experienced that first panic attack that I was broken inside and ruined for life to forever have panic attacks.  I went to the doctor, explained what was happening and got lucky enough to find this one first which works for me.  I have been on it for 4 years at 100mg.  I only experience slight anxiety which is exactly what I want as I can use that anxiety effectively in a situation, and the depression is only normal sadness I'd say, nothing like the things I experienced before. I hope you find what works for you. Don't give up after just trying it for a week or two, it takes a while and it may get worse before it gets better.  Also, I did know a close family member that tried taking an SSRI and it caused acute psychosis with a complete detachment from reality.  It turned out they were bipolar and SSRIs were not compatible, lesson in point have someone close to you monitor you and make sure you're not going cookoo, you crazy SOB

I felt happier but it also made me too passive (which is unacceptable in my job) and had severe sexual side effects. My doctor gradually weaned me down to a small dose and added a moderate dose of Wellbutrin. I was skeptical because most everything I had read warned against this drug combo but it has worked perfectly for me. as others have noted you do not want to suddenly stop taking this med.

It should be made a class A drug. It is basically legal bath salts. It gave me thoughts of carelessness, hostility, aggression, violence, increased sex drive, thoughts of rape, suicidal thoughts, irrational thoughts and I wanted to kill people I care about. I am a very Anxious person but all of those side effects are way out of my characteristics. One afternoon after a heated argument I went home angry and I had just had enough of Zoloft. I went against doctors orders and flushed all the Zolfot pills down the toilet. It was the best choice I ever made after enduring 3 days of horrible withdrawal effects. I am now on track to recovery. I have Anxiety Disorder and mild Depression. I warn you its not worth it. Never take Zoloft or any SSRIS drugs like that. Take my word for it. Trust me. I have finally got the courage to warn you and prevent you from making the same mistake as me. I would rather smoke 1 pack of cigarettes a day then take Zoloft.

Makes such a difference. 
People react differently to same medications we may be taking.. Go to a professional. who knows how and what to prescribe. My family has history of depression/anxiety the females in the family find that zoloft works well for all of us. (genetic?)  I was diagnosed with a anxiety problem at 13 yrs old.  Those were the days of valium..only. Very difficult time in life when these issues really weren't discussed. I didn't start taking anything until I was 42yrs. Tried any and all natural health products. I don't like to take medication, but I am attempting to be responsible and know that I do need it, for myself and others that are in my life.

I can honestly say I have never felt worse in my entire life, I have had almost every side effect listed on Wed MD, including eye twitching and a lazy right eye. I cannot sleep, I have tremors and feel like I was punched in the face. My muscles are chronically sore and aching. I cannot focus, my mood has changed subtly but not drastically. I feel like a completely different person. I'm chronically exhausted and just cannot function like a normal human. Am going to try to continue at just 25mg however, personally after reading reviews it does not look like this drug is the best. Please read the reviews before starting an SSRI like this one.

27$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/17/2016 5:57:06 PM$Reviewer: Dalten,  Male $4$4$5$My cousin was diagnosed with OCD and severe anxiety. His doctor proscribed sertraline for it and it seemed to work. One thing it has seemed to affect is his appetite and sleep. One night we were watching TV before bed and all of the sudden he moves around a bit. Then the next thing I know he starts touching me and grabbing me slowly, so I turned to him and it looked like he was absolutely awake. So I was like what the heck and I grabbed and shook him but nothing happened. After shaking him more he finally woke up and freaked out, this is why you dont wake up a sleeping dramer/sleepwalker. Needless to say, he was actually sleeping but one of the side affects of this drug causes some weird stuff to happen in his sleep. But overall, it does its job.

Over 10 months after starting the treatment, I gained 30 stubborn pounds that mostly sat around my abdomen and face. I run 60 miles a week, weight train 3 times a week, and eat a strict diet. By the time I made the connection between my weight gain and the drug I had already spent 10 months redeveloping bad eating disorder habits to try and control my weight. For the past 6 days I have ceased taking the drug cold (no weaning) under supervision of a NEW doctor. The withdrawal symptoms are unreal -- like having the flu PLUS a terrible hangover right after putting your head on a bat and spinning around and around and around and around. Positively speaking, all of the sleep issues, bad dreams, numbed sexual sensation, loss of emotion, fatigue/sluggishness I experienced while taking the med has almost completely reversed in less than a week. Seems pretty clear my body processed this drug as pure junk.

After about 5 minutes I began to come around.  About 20 minutes later (while the EMT's were with me, I passed out again and had to rushed to emergency room. Dr. called back and said to tell EMT's he said the medicine was the cause.  I stopped taking the sertraline and once it is out of my system, I will commence taking St. John's Wort again.

However, I spent the next 4 weeks extremely constipated DESPITE eating tons of hydrating fruits, prunes, & lots of water daily. 
It's hard to tell if the irritability I experienced was because of the medication itself or a result of the constipation, but ultimately I decided that it wasn't worth it, and quit cold turkey with zero ill effects. I felt back to my normal self the next day. 

The experience taught me that I could feel worse, so needless to say I'm counting my blessings without it ?? 

One thing I did like about it, was that it suppressed my appetite & I lost 10lbs in those 6 weeks (I feared gaining weight on it based on other reviews)

Of course no medication is perfect and I still need to work on my anxiety sometimes. Overall Iam very satisfied with its effect and would suggest it to others dealing with severe anxiety issues.

I try to lower my dosage from time to time so I don't have to go more than 200 mg.  When I see a difference, I would go back to my dosage.  In the beginning, I was a little nausea and dry mouth.  I could feel the balance within a week to two weeks. 
 My only concern was some of the side effects... severe dry mouth and night sweats.  The night sweat was really bad to the point I recently stopped taking it.  It only got worsen over time.  I would wake up like I got out of the shower, wet hair and soaked pillows/comforter/bed.  I'm trying to find a new medication at the moment. "

I do not recommend this drug to anyone if it's being prescribed for anxiety. I've had mild episodes of depression in my life but this drug brought it out big time. It was prescribed to me for panic attacks and anxiety. But the transition was terrible. I never felt like myself, I was never up only down. It made me so depressed and just blah all the time. Honestly it ruined my life and I would never recommend it. 
574$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/16/2016 10:06:38 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My life has changed with zoloft. After years of suffering from general anxiety disorder; I have found peace. No more 800 hamsters running in my head. Millions of ideas swirling in my mind even when I slept. At 50 for the first time in my life, no more mood swings either. I was living a difficult situation that only made my emotional state worse till I had full blown panic attacks again...which I hadn't had in 20 years. Due to my state I was put on the maximum dosage of 200 mg, starting at 100 mg and making my way up. My revision comes up in April of 2017. The dosage will be lowered. I am willing to do cognitive therapy.  However, my doctor agrees that at my age changing the way I think is a difficult task. So I will be on zoloft for the rest of my life and I am fine with that because now I have more of a normal life. I wish I had been diagnosed in my 20's....would have made my life so much simpler...but I count myself lucky to have it now. If this medication doesn't work for you, keep trying there is one out there that will....and gives you a better and brighter life.

Experienced many side effects: hand tremors, blurred vision, low libido, night sweats, etc... Next Doctor's visit will ask to try something else
585$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$8/15/2016 1:21:40 PM$Reviewer: Emmacj, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$4$I am back again.  I have taken almost every drug known to man for anxiety!!!   I always revert back to zoloft.  Beside Paxil and Buspar, those are the only REAL meds with anti anxiety properties to them that are NOT benzo and addictive.  The other anti depress can work but I really need it for anxiety 100% not depression.  I had reported that I got headaches and body aches due to jaw clenching and grinding teeth and scrunching up my body at night but I will take that over the other side effects from other meds.  If i stay at 100 mg and not go up to 150 mg then sex is not affected.  Never gain weight from this med.  I will give it a try again and deal with headaches!  This one truly does work for SAD, GADS, anxiety etc...  Oh its way cheaper than the other newer ones I was trying.
611$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/24/2015 7:04:35 PM$Reviewer: (None), 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$4$"I'm 29, 5'6"" and I've been taking Zoloft 50mg for about 4 years. When I started I weighed 145lbs. At this point I weigh 220lbs. I regularly exercise and I usually run about 3 miles every other day. The problem is, I'm in the Air Force and we have a strict waist size; I don't meet this requirement despite putting in a lot of exercise and effort (eating also). i just had my annual Dr. Appt and he decided to finally take me off the medication slowly which he said will help my weight-loss. I started with a full pill every other day and a half pill every other day. I'm currently on a half pill a day and just had my first anxiety attack in years; only this time I was able to control it better. I was told to expect these symptoms until I'm off it for a little while. Please, if/when you start coming off this medication DO NOT skip a meal. The stomach cramps will return like when you first started the medication. Overall it worked great. There were days I felt a little sluggish because of it, but it usually went away by mid-morning."

Guyton, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was actually suffering from frequent stomach and occasionally chest pains for 3 years.  After being cleared by specialists for lungs, heart, stomach  and intestines, I tried 3 different acid re-flux meds, none of which worked, then my PCP took a long-shot idea and told me to try Zoloft.  I did, and, to my total surprise, in 3 days my symptoms were gone, and they've been gone for 2 years now thanks to Zoloft, and only taking 25 mg.  Who would have guessed, my underlying stress from work, and leadership roles in the community, had manifested itself in inexplicable upper abdominal and chest pains.  This has been my miracle drug, and its calming effect has even helped me in relationships, my job as a college lecturer, and even sports.  I wish all upper-GI and thoracic doctors could know this in order to help others.  W. Guyton
