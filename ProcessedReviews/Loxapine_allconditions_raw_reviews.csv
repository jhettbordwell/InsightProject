3$Condition: Schizophrenia$5/4/2011 11:29:41 PM$Reviewer: halburt, 45-54 Male  (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on loxapine since 1988 and I owe my survival to it. However never stop taking this medicine. You'll have a serious relapse.

It allows me to function at a high level while maintaining my stability and I have not been hospitalized since I have been on this medication (2003).  Unfortunately, I was not able to completely stop the zyprexa I had been taking; I still need a small dose of 2.5mg of that as well.  But along with my mood stabilizer (lamictal) and my antidepressant(wellbutrin 
SR), I never dreamed I would be this stable.  I have some side effects, though nothing that bothersome.  I have occasional muscle twitches, which I choose to put up with rather than add yet another medication (like cogentin).  I am almost completely symptom free.  I have read that loxapine is very similar to clozapine, but doesn't cause as much weight gain or blood disorders.  Oh, that's another thing: I have been able to lose over 70 lbs since going on this drug and reducing the zyprexa.  I HIGHLY recommend this drug for schizophrenia or schizoaffective; I'm not sure why it's not prescribed more often.  I suspect it is almost as effective as clozapine."

10$Condition: Schizophrenia$7/21/2015 11:33:46 PM$Reviewer: Bobbi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been on several different antipsychotics with many side effects, and Loxapine has been very effective in treating my hallucinations and delusions with minimal side effects. The other antipsychotics made me gain weight because I was always hungry which is not the case with Loxapine. I do get fast heartbeats at times, sweat when standing for prolonged periods, and have difficulty falling asleep, but I do take it at night. I sleep well once asleep. and I'm able to think clearly the next day/ I work and go to school and I wouldn't be able to on any of the other antipsychotics that make you drowsy all the time. I do wish I didn't have the blank look on my face all the time, but the benefits definitely outweigh the side effects. I am truly grateful for this drug. It has changed my quality of life.

12$Condition: Schizophrenia$9/12/2013 12:58:23 PM$Reviewer: Liliana, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$After several partially successful trials of atypical antiphsychotics, my doctor decided to try loxapine.  I have mild tardive dyskinesia, but it's hard to say if that is due to the loxapine or the high doses of various combinations of atypical antipsychotics I've taken.  It doesn't make me sedated and I've been able to lose all the weight I gained while taking the atypical antipsychotics.  My blood glucose has increased a little since taking it.

I cannot tollerate the newer drugs for bipolar disorder (mood stablizers).  This drug did not make me swell up like the newer drugs do.
