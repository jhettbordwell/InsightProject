3$Condition: Aggressive Behavior$11/28/2009 5:24:35 PM$Reviewer: drinlynn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This is the ONLY medication that reduces/eliminates my severe aggitation & aggrssion. For years doctors gave me nerve pills (ex:klonopin,zanax) in addition to my other meds & kept saying what I had been feeling was anxiety. Feeling excessively aggitated & the onset of an attack is completely different than having an anxiety attack/anxious feelings. All anxiety meds do is make me sleep for hours. Finally, I can control my aggitation and live a very normal functional life. (I also take 3 depression meds daily as well as anxiety medication as needed- and I NEVER need it now!) Haloperidol is a miracle!
4$Condition: Other$3/11/2013 11:53:22 AM$Reviewer: peggys daughter, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$1$Why do health care professionals, i.e. doctors and nurses continue to prescribe this drug esp. for elderly w/dementia; can be very dangerous, is known to not be effective for agitation.  In fact, it makes the patient more agitated and my poor mother nearly died from the exhaustion.

14$Condition: Other$5/27/2014 6:32:47 AM$Reviewer: StormAngelus, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$3$"I used to take haldol (its shortened name) because of Tourette's syndrome when I was diagnosed at 12 years old. Let me tell you something: THIS. STUFF. SUCKS.
It caused my tics to get worse, made my life even harder because I was being made fun of at school and did nothing to alleviate my symptoms. This stuff did nothing to ease the tics, and made it harder to sleep, hard to concentrate, and generally difficult to focus and study. I flunked 2 classes when I was on this stuff, something that had NEVER happened before. I will absolutely refuse to ever take this medication again, and I will NEVER recommend it to anybody!"
