1$Condition: Other$10/28/2015 5:32:03 PM$Reviewer: LA, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$I have been prescribed this twice for pain. Once for pleurisy pain and now for kidney stones. Supposed to take one every 6 hours. It takes 2 hours for Tramadol to begin easing pain SLIGHTLY, then it only works for about 2 hours. Thus I suffer for the last two hours before time to take next dose. doc said to take with Extra Strength Tylenol to increase pain relief effectiveness. Pitiful excuse for pain reliever but doc won't give me anything stronger despite being his patient for 11 years. Time to shop for new doctor.

I have had no issues with interactions or side effects.  It has worked so well that I thought it was not working, but if I skip just one dose I definitely feel the difference.  It keeps my hand from cramping and curling into claws on heavy days at work.

I've been taking Tramadol for over 9 years now and if I run out of it I will end up in the emergency room. before this 9 year period, I was seeing a psychiatrist regularly and had many hospitalizations for mental problems for over 20 years before I started Tramadol. None of their psychiatric medications worked very well. Since I have been taking Tramadol (9 Years Now)I have not had to see a psychiatrist. There are some bad side effects such as memory loss, slight depression, tiredness, and a few other things, but the benefits greatly outweigh the side effects. I have had to adjust the amounts over the years and now taking two 50MG tabs three times daily. This seems to be the best for me. I believe solving the lower back pains has been the major part of solving my problems.

One at the end of that day and one the next morning gets me to be able to function fairly easily. I am of the mentallity that if I had no pain, I would deffinitely over do it. This takes most pain away with little to no side affects.

Do not drive and make sure you eat well. tends too decrease appetite, and increase thirst with some imbalance.  Yet, very alert. takes at least and hour and one-half for pain to start to minimize. Muscles will relax suddenly to where you may walk and talk as if you are drunk at this point you must  have bed rest to avoid any injury. no other medication is needed and be sure to have any other medication out of your system before starting.

But this past month, I encountered what I think is a batch that will not adhere to my skin. I have been very careful to apply it to clean, dry skin. The first one barely made it the week. Thesecond one, three days, and I used the adhesive cover which itches after a few days. the third one lasted one day and I lost that one altogether. I went without two days, and put the last patch on under the adhesive cover in hopes it will last 11 days, as my pharmacy will not issue them early. they suggested I contact the mfr.

35$Condition: Tourette's$3/9/2014 7:42:17 PM$Reviewer: S.Silvers4, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$I've been taking Clonidine both in pill and patch forms since I was first officially diagnosed with Tourette's Disorder when I was 12 (even though I had severe symptoms of it all throughout my childhood up to and including the point of diagnosis). When I switched to the Catapres Clonidine Transdermal Patch around my high school years, I chose to because I had issues remembering how many pills I had to take and what times of the day I already took and would need to take them, and the patch offered me the option of only having to slap one on every week and that's it, no pills to keep track of or anything. I still keep the pills just in case I need an extra dose because my patch's effectiveness is dwindling towards the end of the week, but overall, the patch itself is not only handy and useful in both my remembering to take my medication, but it's also helped me significantly with being able to control and overcome my excessive movements, twitches, and tics, even though I'm not always able to completely stop them from occurring all the time. My only issue with this patch is how irritated it makes the parts of my chest where I keep it (which is inside near the upper portion of my bra - safer, less likely to fall off than if it were on my arm or elsewhere). The glue rubs off after a couple days of usage, and that might be because I take it off to shower or just because it wears off. And the glue does make the skin itchy, which I thought was partly due to my sensitive skin I have anyway even though the packaging states skin irritation may occur. Honestly, though? Even despite any side-effects I may have had growing up with this medication, I'm glad to have it, because it makes dealing with my condition so very much easier than if I never had it in the first place. Without it, it's difficult to function and stop twitching, so heed the warnings about not immediately stopping your dosage on it. If you need to stop, wean yourself off slowly at your doctor's advice!

Side effects? 1) I get a localized skin reaction where the patch was applied, so I have square ""scars"" all over from each patch. 2) I have been getting small sores inside my nose, which could be a side effect, or could be something else, I just haven't had them before."

It's like taking a shower with my body providing the water For the first month I could NOT keep the patch on no matter what. I tried just the patch, the patch with the white cover and finally with bandaids over everything and even with these clear adhisive covers. NOTHING worked! Today the nurse said to try that sports wrap the sticks to itself. It  is stretchy and I can't imagine wearing all night without taking it off in my sleep since it constricting my arm and has to to stay on. I am overweight and have large upper arms whick may be a problem with the sports wrap. I can't say if it works or not since I haven't been able to keep one on! My friend is a massage therapist and has some type of a paper tape that may be able to work. I'll contrack her tomorrow. Maybe they don't expect women to have such hot and WET hot flashes when they made the patch.

If we forget, usually at night, you can really tell the difference.  The first thing the next morning you now RIGHT AWAY if he missed. Wow!  We switched health plans and now they are charging us $350 avg for month for 120 pills.  I just looked at the reviews on Intuniv, NO WAY I will switch him to that, I'll pay the money and look for better insurance.  I highly recommend CapVay.  The only thing is that it can make him sleepy from time to time, but he used to wear out from the HD and crash all the time, so not really much difference there anyway."

He had already been taking clonodine, so this was a nice long acting version that allowed me to give him much less Focalin (his other med).  However, after about two months, he developed a severe facial tick, pulling one side of his mouth back, had trouble focusing his eyes, and was pulling his eye back and blinking as well.  Fortunately, after taking him off of it, he is 98% better.  We were sorry we couldn't use it anymore, but be on the lookout for these symptoms.

Kapvay is of course the more recent medication.  Vyvanse worked alright for awhile on it's own but he started talking way too much and was too wired to go to sleep.  I was constantly receiving notes from school about him beind disruptive and talking too much then of course bedtime was a battle.  Before kapvay we'd have to stay up with him until he was tired enough to sleep. If we put him to bed at his usual 8:30 he'd talk for like 2 hours straight.  As soon as we started Kapvay it was great.  It helped take the edge off and he started getting tired around bedtime FINALLY! No more staying up with my 6 year old.  And behavior has improved in school.  He currently takes 50mg of Vyvanse and 0.2mg daily (Kapvay twice daily 0.1mg in the morning and 0.1mg just after dinner). I was surprised at how quickly it started to work since it says it does not really work until 5 weeks of taking the meds.  He has only been taking Kapvay 3 weeks now but we saw changes in his sleeping at the end of the first week and behavior changes at school the 2nd week! Considering it's only been 3 weeks I can't wait to see how things will be at 5 weeks. Kapvay has definitely made me hopeful. And my son is much happier.  I would say the only side effect he's experiencing which I didn't even really realize until today is the dry mouth.  He's been drinking more water lately and he typically hates water.  So it's kind of a plus for us although we do keep an eye on him in case he starts overdoing it.

Kapvay has helped with the tic quite a bit although when he is over stimulated it still comes out in full force.  Currently, he is not on ADD meds anymore, just the Kapvay .3mg. In the beginning it did make him very tired and each time we dose-up it starts the tiredness over but after about 2 weeks he's almost back to normal. If you ask him, he would rather be a little tired than to have the head tic. I don't know that I would say it has helped with his focus or concentration but it has slowed him down which helps with his classroom behavior.

Listen to what your doctor and pharmacist tells you. My doctor told me taking this medication with all my other pills will be fine. No issues.
He was 100% correct. Had I have researched this medication before taking it, I probably wouldn't have even bothered with it.

Online warnings with the detailed info behind your prescriptions are only listed to cover their butts from being sued. Basically, these warnings could be for 1 out of 100,000 people for all we know. It's much better to avoid researching your medication online, unless absolutely necessary and last resort. For most people, it is easy to mentally create negative effects due to simply reading all the bad stuff. Thus damaging your medications true intent.

Instead, visit a hospital, doctor, or walk into your local pharmacy if health care isn't free. They will all help you.

Doctors usually know their medications. They are usually way smarter than you and I. If you have a bad Doctor, simply get a new one. A good doctor will tell you what you need to know before giving you a prescription, and the pharmacist should touch base with these things as well.

I know folx on the spectrum can have more intense side effects/reactions to CNS medications and I'm wondering if that's related? I noticed a couple people have similar experiences with their kids. I'd love to know if anyone's had any luck managing that side effect or figuring out why it happens.

Then I started getting hives, and my skin itched so badly under the patch that it felt like it was on fire. So I made an appointment and told my NP about the skin reaction.  We decided to try pill form.  Not the best idea. After a couple of days I had a severe allergic reaction. In dealing with the allergy I found that all the other issues I had were side effects of the clonidine.  Luckily I did not have difficulty breathing, but my face swelled horribly.

Additionally I was receiving daily decreasing amounts of Klonopin, ibuprofen, and pepto bismal. I think the Clonidine and Klonopin had tremendously helped me feel better. I still had the normal withdrawl symptoms, but atleast I was able to get a couple hours of SLEEP a night and didn't just roll around restlessly the whole time. The only issue was since this is also used for high blood pressure, they wouldn't give it to me when my blood pressure was too low. This could be because I was hardly able to eat or drink anything and from hardly moving around.

I found it worked better during the day as would stop my eyes running and I would only have to stretch a bit = cam eand went but made things more tolerable. I'd rather have it if nothing else = but this is an ethical issue in my opinion as the only reason I needed it as the Doctor believes no one gets pain relief from opiates and we should live with the pain.

Case in point: I can take Valium & still move about freely, plenty of energy to work on my job. But clonidine? A big No. Clonidine sucks all energy & motivation out of me, makes me feel like I have iron-deficiency anemia. Recently a co-worker remarked, ""my god... your eyes...they look DEAD,"" after I'd taken a prescribed dose of clonidine. The sapping-of-energy is *that* noticeable to others.

Clonidine just makes both of that worse. It's my *last choice* for opiate withdrawal. Ok, what clonidine will do is: alleviate restlesness & perhaps force you to rest if you're about to go crazy, but that's about all. I eventually found that having clonidine around *as a backup/adjunct to other w.d. aids* is more reliable. One example, kratom (a legal herbal opioid), totally reverses the mental depression & lack of energy - that's important when you've got a good job to keep. A Valium or two, here & there, maybe a clonidine if the blood pressure spikes. But as the sole agent in opioid withdrawal clonidine is a poor choice. It's got the side effect of making you feel like crap - when you already do. You'll go right back to your opiate drug if you rely on clonidine alone, trust me.
112$Condition: High Blood Pressure$2/1/2015 11:19:54 PM$Reviewer: binkey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$Been taking for 4 days and blood pressure has dropped dramatically- so it has done what was intended.  Side affects so far are a VERY DRY MOUTH (like swallowing cotton balls!), very tired within an hours of taking pill and sleep has been sparatic due to having to urinate more due to to excessive consumption of water to combat dry mouth (.1 2x daily), and have seem to have lost sexual desire.  Have Tourette's as well but too soon to see if it helps.  I seem to be calmer, more relaxed- maybe too relaxed.  Jury is still out- will stick it out for a month or so.  nice to see my BP is normal for the 1st time in 30+ years.

Extremely tired after taking, hair started to fall out, experienced terrible dizzy spells and 30 plus pounds weight gain. Lost control of my bladder after a few months of taking, (way too young at 55 to have all of those symptoms appear AFTER starting the medication). All of these symptoms become worse so I stopped taking the medication. Within 3 days of stopping the medication my bladder problems improved, my hair stopped falling out by 95%, and each day I am SLOWLY starting to feel normal again. It became so bad that I stayed in bed unable to function. This medication is awful and although it is inexpensive and easy to take, the side effects were horrible. I am slowly getting better. It also caused my blood pressure to spike. Awful medication.

I was then put on the pills that worked as well as the patch for hypertension but they make me soooo sleepy. I fall asleep in mid sentence. If I know I have quite a bit of driving to do, I wait until later to take it. My sister fell asleep driving several times when she was on it, thank God she did not get into any accidents. I did not experience these side effects when I used the patch, I really wish I could figure out some way I could go back to the patches without the allergy to the adhesive. Any suggestions?

It did help me sleep better and lower my BP from around 155 to 145. Not really strong enough to manage my BP. Side effects included dehydration (mouth, vagina and stools)caused constipation. Also caused drowsiness to the point that sometimes  I would have to take a nap during the daytime. Plus I would have intense dreams.  Lastly you can't just stop taking it, you have to slowly reduce medicine or you get severe headaches.

BP was 190/130 when started and down right away(1 day)after the .3 dose 2X/day. Been on it for about 1 year and like it because it lowers BP to normal and also calms me and I won't take benzos because of addiction, tolerance, withdrawal. Had severe tiredness, no energy, no motivation for 1-2 mos. but not bad any longer. The Walgreens summary sad this could last several weeks so I kept going and it did get better. When I would not take a BP med and have very high BP, I would get constant 24hr dull, pressure frontal headaches and the Clonidine, lowering my BP, took it away.
Before Clonidine, had taken 3 others and none lowered my BP below 140's/90-100. I like Clonidine, and only side effects are the tiredness which does get better with time, dry nostrils, throat and eyes(not debilitating at all). Wish I didn't have hypertension but I do and feel better taking Clonidine."

The ARNP I was told to see because my new doctor was out and her ARNP was too busy, the back ARNP took me totally off my blood pressure pills, I have been on for 10 years off because I was covered in hives. Well the next day I was in the hospital for not only the hives and trouble breathing, I was withdrawing. So the Hospital gave me Clonidine 0.1 mg and I have not felt better in years. It lowered my blood pressure really well, and I had been running high for a year. Anway, the Clonidine evened me out, and I feel like a new person. I have a cough, and dry mouth. The cough might be from the residue allergy reactions, I don't know but my doctor isn't worried about it right now. She wants me to give my body a break. So we are doing this. My legs do get a little heavy but that is alot better than hives and problems breathing from Atenolol, Metropolol or some other thing I was on.

I started out at .1 2x daily. Over time I increased (with my PCP's approval) to 1.2 mg. daily. Yes I was taking .3 4x daily. I never got over the side effects. I had them all. When it came time to increase once again, (because the dose always became ineffective over time) I was told by a pharmacist that I was taking double the regular maximum dose, & was I sure that I wanted to increase again. I got frightened by this, but also wondered why my PCP never said anything. I stayed at the same dose. Of course my BP was always too high. So I decided to taper off. I began reducing by 1/4 of .1 at a time, & I began supplementing with Lisinopril. Everything was going well for about a month. Then I started spotting. This is not good since I'm 58 & postmenopausal. It's been 11 days now & I'm bleeding to the point where I have to take an iron tablet daily. My gynecologist said that this was actually good because it meant that my estrogen levels were rising. Meaning that the Clonidine had suppressed them to begin with. I haven't spoken to my gyne since the 1st day. The bleeding is not showing any signs of stopping. Has anyone else had this experience? Can anyone give me any advice? Thanks in advance.

Only taking at night, so it's good to be tired then. A little dry mouth, but I have salagen (pilocarpine) left over from taking with other drugs and that should relieve the cotton mouth if it gets bad. Such a relief to be able to go to sleep. All my life I slept well, until this withdrawal from a tiny dose of methadone. I'm at 2.5 mg of methadone, soon to go to 0, so I may not be on clonidone too long.

They administered Clonidine to me in the ER to get my presurre down (and oxygen to help me breath although my oxygen level was fine, almost 100%.

This is the fifth day since I was given Clonidine and athough my pressure is much lower, 144/100, I had still have the heart palpitations when I go to sleep, itching and terrible night sweat (woke me out of my sleep last night).  My doctor says Clonidine is the culprit and that she will wean me off once in pressure is better.  I wonder what is the point, if it will spike again once she gets me off.  I tired alot too and can't walk long distances at my normal pace as I get winded.

It still makes me tired but the worst effect is dry mouth. I've spent a lot of money on dental work that my dentist says is caused by chronic dry mouth. My only complaint is that many -- and I should say most -- doctors do not understand the almost universal physical addiction this drug causes and how really sick you can get when the drug is stopped. Even tapering the drug can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Everything from vomiting, restlessness, diarrhea, headache, very high blood pressure, sweating. . . another reviewer commented on strange dreams, too. It's like a really bad case of the flu multiplied 100 times. Withdrawal can start as soon as 24 hours after your last dose. I went through perimenopause on this drug and it did nothing to stop the hot flashes.  This drug has been on the market forever.  Manufacturers need to educate the medical community on the addiction problem and the consequences of stopping the drug abruptly.  There are too many patients out there feeling really sick and they don't understand it's the lack or, or tapering of, their clonidine.

Normal resting heart rate was upper 50s.  Med dropped that to low 40s.  Initially very tired first hour after taking a whole pill.  So I change to taking 4 half pills per day.  That has helped with the tiredness.  Still do feel tired and can fall asleep on a wink.  But, that's not so new with me.  Driving has me worried.  We like to take trips.  I've found that about 30 minutes in to a 2 hour drive I'm slapping myself around to stay awake.  I noticed that if I don't take the med at regular intervals, my bp jumps around a lot.  The bp wanders around if I don't stick closely to a 6 hour schedule.  I've experimented with 2-1/2 pills during the day and one whole pill at bed time.  That didn't do a good job of control.  I'm working on trying to stay awake all day.  I find that a real strong cup of coffee and a strenous long walk first thing in the morning helps me stay awake until noon.  Found that it is almost impossible to get my heart rate over 65.  More strong coffee mid afternoon and no long sitting gets me through that time of day.  I've always been a night person, so I'm o.k. in the evening.

He was first diagnosed with adhd and odd.  He was then misdiagnosed as bipolar because of his temper tantrums.  I have not seen any change in his taking clonidine twice a day for a month now, but the Zoloft,  Concerta and melatonin (for drowsiness at night) have been a huge help.  I just wish we started medicating before he turned 8 - it has been such a big improvement in his ability to socialize and obey.  He really needs medication for his brain to link discipline with his actions.

My ongoing problem is that I am a physiologist, with a specialty in biochemical medications. W/o Clonidine, my BP would spike to abnormal levels and upon taking my .3mg dose ( 2x/day) the pb would lower to abnormal levels. Clonidine/Catapress are fast acting
short duration chemicals; regular daily dosing will result in rebound levels of BP. Ultimately I found ( for me) taking quarter doses (.016mgs) 4x daily keeps the blood levels in a safe range, does not provide all the nasty side effects and keeps the BP at a reasonable level. Using this drug "" as needed""  or at regular recommended doses seems to impair the function of these meds. I might add, even with regular low dosing, ""as needed"" dosing may still be required as per diet and environmental conditions change daily.

When I take this it works wonderfully.  I found that after taking for a month, I developed rebound headaches because my blood pressure would go up in the morning.  It works by lowering your blood pressure and thereby your heart rate, and hence sleep.  My docter explained, some people will see a rebound rise in blood pressure if they do not take it two or enen three times a day, as it was developed to be taken to amintain a lower blood pressure.  In people whose bodies quickly adjust to new medications, rebound headaches will develope.  Now I take it every other day.  If you go off too fast you risk high blood pressure spikes (and if your blood pressure is already high, a possible stroke.  This is why some people have bad withdrawal symptoms.)  Always go off gradually, splitting the dose with a pill cutter and then going every other day for a while.  Hope this helps, especially for the parents out there.

My doctor wanted me to try using this medication in a patch form since he's prescribed this med. to be taken 3 times a day. I couldn't handle the patch and it was not covered by my insurance. All I know is that Clonidine effects your central nervous system so if you're sleepy while taking it that's why. It can cause nightmares as well and lately I seem to be having my share. DO get your eyes checked yearly for clonidine can damage the retina. How can a drug company allow such side effects and not be stopped from marketing this dangerous drug.

It used to take a long time to get to sleep.  However, our bigger concern was him staying asleep through the night. He was waking up 4 or 5 times a night, scared, with bad dreams.  He has rarely  ever slept all night long. He has been on .1 mg, once at night.  We give it to him about an hour and a half before bed, and by bedtime, he is ready, and asleep in minutes. He still wakes up once or twice during the night, and he doesnt always know why he wakes up.  He has wet the bed on several occasions, and woke up soaked.  I do not want to give him a higher dosage, because I am not fully comfortable with this option.  He also just started Concerta 2 days ago, and has been on Zoloft for a few months.  We also have been working with Iron Suppliments, because his Ferotin levels were very low.  But, nothing is keeping him asleep through the night.

After a thorough eval, the doctor put me on Clonidine for withdrawal symptoms and Ativan for anxiety. The combination floored me ... I slept all day and all night with very few moments of lucidity. It took my normal, healthy resting heart rate from 70 to 50, and made me feel completely dazed and confused. No more jitters from withdrawal, and got the doc's okay to stop using it (only took total 4 doses), so we'll see what happens. If the jitters come back, he said its okay to use again ... I'm praying that was it! Didn't like how I felt on this drug at all. Extreme tiredness, depression and slow heartbeat were my side effects.

The most intense and I'm dealing with right now is whatit does to my BLadder. I am  in  alot of pain in the bladder region with urgency and efrequency. I have been checked our for U.T.I which I get often enough with having I.C (Cystitis without infection), and I am convinced that this drug has flared me up in my bladder. I also get acid reflux from this drug as well. Have a feeling of :""La la land"" sometimes with this medication. I overall just feel sickly with taking Clonidine and unfortunately for me all the other B.P. meds have other bad side effects. Clonidine however is tough on the kidneys hence my dr. Quack should never have prescribed it to me because I have a chronic Bladder issue. RME. Hope  some have better luck with this because for me it isn't a keeper. 
NOt going to continue to take a drug that makes me sicker than before taking it. That doesn't benefit me at all. Good luck P.S. also upper reflux into mouth as well with Clonidine. You feel like acid coming up into your throat. badddd"

My grandson who just turned 3 was diagnosed with many disabilities,one being a major behavioral issue. Because my sons ex does everything without consulting him (even though he has joint custody) she took my grandson to her physician and he prescribed this medication for him. Everything I have read says not to give to children under the age of 12. That concerns me. Also, my son refuses to give him this medication when he has him. I am worried after what I have been learning that his abrupt interruption of the medication will have an adverse reaction. I am very concerned for my grandson.

Ace inhibiters was causing a cough but they worked. On this drug for about a month still trying to regulate the amount. Was given 0.2mg twice daily but if I took that amount it put me to sleep. Now trying one half at night and one in the morning but still got me sleepy. So today going to one half early and one half about noon and see how that works. One pill in the morning dropped my BP way down to 111/67 much too low for me to function properly. At that level I was a little dizzy and off balance and had to force myself to get up and move around. We will see how this works breaking it up.

I took a single 0.1 mg tablet (as I normally do when this happens)& within 30 min my bp was down to 160/90 & within an hour it was down to about 125/80! This medication has saved my life many times over the past 10 yrs. I am extremely grateful that it's available & works for me. I never knew it had any side effects until I read about them here. I suppose it is because  I do not take it on a regular basis, or maybe I just don't notice them because I am so happy that I don't have to rush to the e.r. everytime my bp goes crazy. I just have to take a clonidine and rest for a couple of hours to be as good as new!!

My son, 5 years old, was diagnosed as having ADHD. My ex-wife and I are divorced and live four hours away so it's hard to be involved on a daily basis. 

My son saw a psychiatrist who prescribed the Clonidine on an ""as needed"" basis at bedtime. I thought that's how my ex-wife was giving it to him but I later found out that she was giving it to him every day.

Anyhow, his new psychaitrist said that it's dangerous to miss a dose and that he needs this medication EVERY day. 

From what I've read, it seems like withdrawl from Clonidine is ONLY dangerous if you give it to someone (in this case my child) for a long period of time (more than 30 days). 

I guess what I'm asking/saying here is that if my son was presribed Clonidine on an ""as needed"" basis, there is no concern for withdrawl, correct?"

After taking in the morning I could not stay awake and would fall asleep on the job, so with the Dr's permission I only take 1/2 tablet in the morning along with my other blood pressure medications which included a beta blocker.  I managed to stay awake as long as I was moving.  The minute I stopped moving I fell asleep.  I take 1/2 tablet in the morning and 1/2 tablet in the evening and one whole tablet before going to bed.  The pill causes me to dream nonstop plus getting up frequently to use the bathroom.   I barely get any sleep and now I have started having heart palpitations.

I am Bi-Polar 1 and I can tell you one thing from many doctors and YEARS of personal experience Bi-polar is not just random mood swings.  It is also random other conditions I have periods of ocd, add, adhd,and many many other things.  This is one of the many problems with bi-polar it really isn't always one disease it is often many at the same time or even may show almost nothing for periods of time (that's my experience as well as a lot of others that I have spoken to.) If your child or you are bi-polar, depending on how your cycles are you may end up changing meds on a regular basis as your body chemistry changes. I have had some great and horrible pill mixes(up to 10 at a time) but for the last few years I have settled on a mix that sort of works most of the time with adderal, ambien, and sometimes others on an ""as needed"" basis.  My point is work slowly with the pills, don't assume that because a pill does one thing good/bad today it will be the same effect later, either alone or in combination of other drugs.  
 I was actually prescribed this a few months ago for VERY high blood pressure and they took me off my adderal for obvious reasons.  Unfortunately I just didn't ""feel like"" going to the doctor to get more pills and up until this week I have been off them.  I am having the same symptoms as I did the last time  for roughly the first week. Severe headaches, insane cotton mouth and having trouble keeping my eyes open. the last one most likely has to do with the fact that I also ran out of my other pills a few days ago and I am getting used to them again.  I took .2 morning and night before but now am trying .1 twice a day.  At the time it didn't occur to me until I stopped taking it that it did help some with my current addhd because she adderal worked so well that I felt like this wasn't doing it, plus I assumed it the lower bp.

Not only it makes me sleep better but my blood pressure is within normal range - combined with my other blood pressure medicine.

This is highly effective medication, but I heard this is not for a long term use.

If one reads side effects too much, our minds tends to focus on that. For me this medication is very effecitve. Thank God. It has been so hard to bring my blood pressure down."

Clonidine was just prescribed for my 2 1/2 year old son due to his extreme hyperactivity.  They stated they aren't sure whether he shows signs of ADHD or BI Polar.  
After reading all the posts regarding young children and the side effects.
I am choosing NOT to give this medication to my son and will deal with his hyperactivity until he is at the age to be properly checked for ADHD.
I didn't have my child till I was 39 and he was a premie at birth, after years of fertility drugs when I was younger and a new marriage, this is my miracle baby. 
I am not willing to take any un-necessary chances with his life.
THANKS FOR ALL THE WONDERFUL INPUT!
It helped my spouse and I make an informed choice regarding giving this to our son.

How did a doctor determine that your THREE YEAR OLD, had extreme ADHD? After going through four doctors I found one that sent my son for real testing for ADHD, the first three said ""Oh he's hyper, we'll put him on this"".We were told that children should be around 5 or 6 before being diagnosed. My son has TS, ADHD,OCD. He is on concerta in the morning and clonodine at night. It hasn't changed how funny and articulate he is but helps slow down the hyperactivity that even HE would say made him mad because he couldn't do things HE wanted to do. Children should only be on ADHD meds when appropriatley tested.Alot of doctors assume the parents are good to their children and that the child isn't being abused ect.. at home causing the ADHD like symptoms.Parents whose children actually have ADHD and chose to medicate should NEVER be viewed as lazy. We are far from it. We work our asses off,(sorry:), to make sure that the child is happy and occupied in a productive way. I have two other children and we have to make sure that each child gets equal treatment while trying to control the sugar,caffeine, and stimuls intake my son with ADHD ect.. gets. Most teachers I have encountered,even though my son's in a special ed inclusion class, think because my son can suppress alot of his Tourettes symptoms that they will be the one that will ""fix"" him. The life a family with a special needs child is one that wants to thrive with the disorders instead of surving in spite of them. Many children are misdiagnosed with ADHD but that only makes the stigma harder for the children, whom actually have it, to overcome. Take diagnosing serious, and make sure your doctor takes the appropriate steps to diagnose. Don't try to diagnose your child for this as a toddler, their attention and hyperactivity levels are usually high and differ from child to child. I didn't medicate my son until he was almost done with kindergarten,6 yrs old).Sorry for the novel:)"

Crushed my thoracic spinal nerves. No-one picked it up for 8 years until I found a great PM anaesthetist. He found 3 levels of crushed spinal nerves after 8 years of being misdiagnosed.Nerve ablation worked really well for me. I always knew it was physical pain Thought I would get better but just got worse. A friend of mine who is a med specialist couldn't believe the pain I was in. Advised me to see an anaesthetist. Wish I had found him first after 8 years of 24/7 pain. Have come down really fast from 80mgs 40mgs 80mgs oxycontin. Am now at 40mgs 40mgs 40mgs in less than one month. Makes my eyes dry and can't speak if I'm not chewing sugarless lollies or drinking water. Wake up every night round 2.30 to 3am take two, go back to sleep. Didn't realise they are addictive so will try one tonight. Never drive if I take one during a rough day. Makes me too tired. Didn't realise they cut down smoking. But at least can go hours without a smoke if I want to. My mum isn't well and have been able to help her instead of being locked in an addiction centre. My eyesight is crap though but don't think it was this med. Had to buy eyedrops and carry water everywhere. I probably feel a bit sick 'cause I still smoke. Wish my GP had told me they could help me quit smoking. Time for laser eye surgery again.

527$Condition: Extremely High Blood Pressure$10/29/2015 6:44:11 PM$Reviewer:  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Have been living with super high blood pressure for a long time, generally feeling like my head was ready to explode along with a weird sensation behind my eyes -  not pressure. Anyway every blood pressure medication made me terribly sick but I was always ready to try the next one, the one that always operated by a different mechanism. Finally, after a trail of failures, it was time for Lamotrigine. Frankly, it has changed my life entirely. At first I was just happy a week had passed without my throwing the pills away, feeling like I was going to die. I also suffered not a single side effect except some fatigue as my body adjusted to a non lethal blood pressure. In fact, my blood pressure dropped immediately to,a pretty normal range and has remained there. Along with with such a dramatic change in pressure I now have much more energy and now experience a sense of calmness rather than the constant anxiety 'for nothing' I had been living with for years. It's obvious that my experience seems to be atypical but in my case I'm overjoyed!

It was awful relying on these medications due to all the side effects, but they did control my pain. One day recently, I got sick of taking them. I asked my physician if I could taper off and he did so to prevent withdrawal. At my last visit, he suggested Clonidine to assist with controlling my migraines and possibly reduce my pain level. I started out on .1 BID and now take .2 TID. It is working pretty well. I have no opiate withdrawal, notable pain relief (not all, but noticeable) and I haven't had one migraine headache. The headaches were likely caused by the car wrecks and they were awful. Clonidine takes awhile to get used to. My only bad side effect is insomnia sometimes that may last for a few days, then I'll sleep normally. Clonidine assists with my pain, prevents opiate withdrawal and my migraine headaches.

Yes, this drug dropped my BP very quickly, but I feel like a zombie.  I wish there was another drug that works as well without this side effect.

But they said my BP was way too high.  There are sooo many actual risks of going cold turkey that people do not realize.  Strokes, Seisures, heart attackes, so DONT try it alone.  Seek help if you want to come off any drug.  This is day 2 of me taking this drug Catapres, and it might have just saved my life.  I will put up with being drowsy.

538$Condition: High Blood Pressure$1/27/2013 8:27:05 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$My high blood BP readings started one day just over a year ago.  After trying 9 medications with side effects to severe for me to handle, I was prescribed clonidine. I started out with one 0.1 mg per day which was then increased to 2 pills per day (0.1 mg) and am now taking 3 pills per day (0.1 mg).  This new dosage is working well but I hate to be on this medication after reading that it can cause glaucoma.  The problem for me is that I'm one of those patients who is allergic to many medications and clonidine is the only one I can handle.  My side effects are dry mouth and chest discomfort with pain down my left arm from time to time but compared to the severe migraines, diarrhea and dizziness while on 9 other BP meds, this one is fantastic.  I would just caution people to research the glaucoma side effect.  Glaucoma leads to blindness.  Is there anyone out there who has found a similar anti-hypertensive high BP medicine with fewer side effects?  Most high BP meds have terrible side effects including eventual kidney damage and diabetes.  Surely there must be something safer out there for us to use!!

low energy,constipation,drowsy,weight gain, especially fat. if u look this med up on wikapeda u will find that this med actually blocks body ablity to use or breakdown fat. Check it out for yourself.  Clonidine or catapress is also hard to get off of. Rebound high bp, n/v.severe headache could result in death or stroke if stoppped to abruptly.

Am sensitive to meds & this does control my BP but side affects are troublesome.   Effectiveness appears to be wearing off the last few months for BP control. Muscle cramps and nightmares are increasing. I also take Norvasc and took Cordorone for about 6 years (have been taken off this one for arrythmia but is taking months to get it out of my system....been off 8 months).  Cordorone affected my thyroid, teeth & gums, hair, muscle tone, stomach, reflux..... bad drug over time..wish I had known. I ask more questions now and am more persistent with DR. concerning my own observations concerning meds and side effects.  I keep a brief diary and it has been SO helpful to recognize  a pattern developing while taking meds and/or symptoms.

If anyone is having with feeling tired, I suggest talking with your dr about adjusting your dosage to maybe twice a day instead of once as Catapres lowers your BP quickly.

My results were:

When I first use the patch or take the pill it effectively drops my blood pressure.  The side effects are so bad that I can't do my work.  Falling asleep while trying to write computer code doesn't exactly make my boss happy.

After I have been taking the medication a few weeks, it has less of an effect on my blood pressure.  I remember one instance when at the doctors they took my blood pressure.  They said 175/110 was too high, put me in a dark room and started feeding me 0.1 mg clonadine tablets.  They did this on the hour for 4 hours.  At the end of that time, they let me go and my BP was 165/115.  I guess I just built up a resistance to it.

par Pharmaceutical (""manufactured by: AVEVA Drug Delivery Systems A Nitto Denko Company"" according to the package).  I was able to locate a second generic version from Mylan Pharmaceuticals.  You may need to deal with a local NON-Chain pharmacy to secure this brand but it is well worth the effort.  This product is very flexible and adheres well for the full 7 days.  It is also comparable in size to the brand name product rather than the oversized PAR version.  So if the co-pay or outright cost of the product is an issue opt for the Mylan generic version if possible for best results."

Additionally my bp is well controlled and resting heart rate is often in the 50's but does not cause any problems such as dizzyness.  This product has recently become available in generic form.  The patch from PAR Pharmaceuticals is significantly larger than Catapres from Boehringer Ingelheim and less flexible.  The PAR brand do not stick well at all.  I have not been able to make then last a full 7 days to this point.  My pharmacist is ordering another generic brand for me to try.  Hopefully this will work better as my insurance has doubled my co-pay on the name brand now that a generic is available.

It took years until I found Lexapro that helped. But after many years of use, I started getting them again, so my doctor added this patch to assist in controlling my attacts. IT has worked wonderfully, stopped my hand tremmors and racing heart. IT also helps with my MS pain levels a bit and headachs I get from IVIG treatments monthly.
I have no problem keeping the patch on at all. Just make sure the area is cleaned with a alchol wipe first, dried and secured without touching the sticky side of patch before putting it on spot you desire. Note, I also take Xanax 1 mg 2 X daily if needed, mainly at night and have found I do not need as often sense I use the patch, nor my pain medicine as often. Stress can often make chronic pain worse and this patch does help mine.
