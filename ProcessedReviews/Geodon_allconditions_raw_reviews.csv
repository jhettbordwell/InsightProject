2$Condition: Manic-Depression$12/15/2016 8:51:21 AM$Reviewer: Kristen8885, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$I was hospitalized due to a severe panic attack and the emergency psych doctor prescribed this medication to me.  Mind you I am only on Wellbutrin and Abilify for depression and anxiety.  Not knowing what this was and trusting him I filled the script.  I took one at night as directed when I returned home and within a half hour I dropped a full cup of coffee and almost fell down my steps outside.  My fiancé literally carried me to bed and I don't remember much afterward.  I brought this to my doctor who in turn said that I should have never been prescribed this and to stop taking it immediately.  Long story short I did not like the way this made me feel incapable of caring for myself or my children so I will not be taking this anymore.  Supposedly this is to be used in emergency situations in the hospital?

I started on 40mg, split in morning and evening. I got the shakes and got very tired in the afternoon but not in the evening.

Moved to 40mg at night. Zombie action

Dropped to 20mg at night. Seemed okay for a while. Psychosis was about 90% controlled. Over a few months I felt like I had no energy and I was losing muscle mass and feeling weak.

Doc ordered a testosterone test, it was dangerously low. She order a prolactin and thyroid test. Thyroid was good, prolactin was three times the high normal range. 

Tapered off, both testosterone and prolactin levels were back to normal inside a month.

I never got near the therapeutic dose."

I was hospitalized due to these symptoms and the doctors were talking about ECT treatments but I refused them all together. Since I have been on Geodon I haven't had a bad episode of Mania. I also take Latuda for the depression which has made all the difference. It has been a year now since I started the Geodon and I take 80 MG twice a day and have been under control. I recommend this drug to anyone who has Bipolor 1 if they can tolerate it.

I went off zeldox cold turkey. my speech was better. my tongue was swollen and that went back to normal. I had hacking coughs choking on my own spit .the spit would go down the wrong way.

7$Condition: Other$12/2/2015 9:16:29 PM$Reviewer: qwerty, 45-54 Male  (Patient) $3$3$3$"For psychosis. 20 MG in the evening.

I used to take 20 in the morning also but caused me to shake and become overly tired. 

Nighttime dose does not give me this side effect, oddly.

No other noticeable side-effects. It did not cause any weight-gain, in fact it suppressed my appetite enough to help be lose 32 pounds in the past 3 months, I also changed my diet and exercised more so it wasn't just the drug that made me lose weight. 

The lighter side-effects and doesn't block weight gain makes it a much better drug than most anti-psychotics."
8$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$10/25/2015 5:06:58 PM$Reviewer: Tara , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$I was diagnosed with Bipolar I in 2005 when I had my first manic episode. I came off my medicine (lithium) in 2011 and just had my second manic episode (10/15/15). The attending physician put me on generic Geodon after I told him it was what the doctor's used to get me down in 2005. I had no idea you could use the drug as a maintenance drug. I hated getting my blood drawn while on lithium so I really like Geodon. I'm on 40 mg twice a day but my doctor already mentioned my dose will be increased. I do have restlessness and nausea in the morning but I'll take these side effects over the paranoid depression state I've been in for the last 3 years off medication. I'm really happy with the drug.

10$Condition: Other$9/5/2015 6:19:04 AM$Reviewer: Greybo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was taking this med for alcoholism.  After my latest trip to the ER then being admitted for 4 days and almost leaving this world, I finally woke up to how serious this really is.  Zipra has helped to pretty much stop all cravings and even makes my stomach turn when I smell it.  I took it twice a day for a week then weaned down to once a day for another week and now I am off of it.  If my cravings come back, I will definitely go to my doctor for a new prescription if it.  Two weeks may not be enough to get me strong enough to go solo yet.  I highly recommend it to others battling alcoholism and are finally ready to make the jump to sobriety.  Something before I could never achieve. My thoughts are clear and it feels so good.  My mood is very good most of the time.  I'm not Mary Poppins, but I'm not a grumpy bear like others times I've quit for even shorter amounts of time. Two weeks and two days today.  Baby steps and this med really has helped me.

12$Condition: Schizophrenia$8/24/2014 3:57:12 PM$Reviewer: Anne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$2$"I was prescribed this medicine because I hear voices. It has worked very well, despite having a difficult time transitioning onto it. I have heard some voices, but they are minimal. However, we had to put me on such a high dosage that I was falling asleep in class. Even on a lower dosage, I had to take an hour to two-hour nap every day and could not stay awake for more than thirty minutes in the car. Then we switched to taking it all at night (another rough transition) but I was still low on energy, so we lowered it again.
We are thinking of lowering the dosage once more, but it is incredibly scary gambling with mental illness, especially during the semester. I can only pray I will not hear voices again.
This drug has the worst withdrawal out of every anti-psychotic I have taken. If I miss the time I'm supposed to take it by two hours, or even one, I begin to feel terrible. My pupils dilate significantly during withdrawals. If I miss taking it during a meal and take it on an empty stomach, it does not kick in for at least an hour. It keeps me awake when I have not taken it as well.
Even talking about this medicine makes me feel terrible. I can only hope that I will eventually switch onto another medication without an episode."

Crawled (somehow--don't remember) to bathroom  and crawled back to bed--don't remember how.  At 11am the next morning my Mother came to check on me because she'd called me several times w/no answer--I was completely dead drunk...and I don't drink alcohol.  BUT I do take Mirapex and 2 MG of Klonopin and 600 MG of Gabapintin at night. These help me sleep, hold down the extreme anxiety after a manic period. Psych said this was a drug usually administered in the hospital where it could be watched--uh-huh....How I wish this would've worked.  It took me 1 hour to eat one piece of toast at 12pm that 1st day because I kept going to sleep while I was eating it.  Thank goodness for a Mother who has put up with the evil ""Ms. Hyde"" and still finds time to care for her daughter instead of deserving the daughter to take care of and enjoy time with her.

31$Condition: Schizophrenia$1/24/2013 8:58:06 PM$Reviewer: Schizobus, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I suffer schizoaffective disorder. I switched from Abilify to Geodon mostly because I could only tolerate a low dose of Abilify, which wasn't providing enough therapeutic value. I now take 60mg of Geodon in the morning with breakfast and 80mg of Geodon in the evening with dinner for a total of 140mg daily. I have been taking over 100mg of Geodon daily for about two years now. Geodon helps prevent my psychosis and balances out my mood. I suffer bad akathisia in the evening a few times a week for a few hours with this drug. Most of the time I just try to sleep when akathisia strikes and I awake feeling better. I sleep a lot on this drug: I usually sleep 5 to 7 hours a night and then another 2 to 4 hours in a nap. I find it crucial to take my doses with a meal, as the oral bioavailability is allegedly reduced in half when consuming the drug without food. I sometimes feel as though I withdraw from the drug if I take my dose off schedule or if I have been unable to consistently take the drug with a meal. The withdrawal begins to manifest in symptoms of anxiety and nausea. I have never been overweight but my weight has fluctuated quite a bit in a range of 40lbs since I started taking antipsychotic drugs. I find Geodon doesn't make me gain so much weight for an antipsychotic but I currently have a BMI of 22. Geodon is probably my favorite neuroleptic of the five that I have tried so far.

Finally I felt pleasure which is hard to come by. It was my miracle drug until the Grand Mal seizure as a result of an allergy to the drug. I have suffered several years since and now take 6 meds.

49$Condition: Other$11/1/2010 8:33:10 AM$Reviewer: nootropics, 35-44 Male  (Patient) $5$5$4$Schizoaffective disorder.  Hospitalised against will 6 times due to psychosis and mania.  Medications used since 1997: mood stabilizers- lithium, valproate, lamotrigine; antipsychotics- risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, quetiapine, aripiprazole; antidepressants- venlafaxine, fluoxetine, reboxetine, paroxetine, mianserin all under close supervision of treating psychiatrist.  Results of ziprasidone monotherapy: only drug that works particularly for refractory bipolar depression and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Concerns over lack of efficacy due to underdosing in clinical practice.  Small side-effect footprint so can be used for maintenance therapy.  Without this drug I would be facing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  Currently taking 40mg morning and 120mg night (to better regulate sleep rhythms).  Ziprasidone has unique pharmacodynamic action in that it is like an antidepressant/mood stabilizer/antipsychotic rolled into one (dopamine/serotonin modulator plus serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor).  Can adjust dose to achieve required mood stabilization but can over-activate at lower doses (cause mania/hypomania).  Action on alpha 1 adrenoreceptors probably causes the cardiovascular side effects (vasodilation= reduced cardiac output=hypotension=dizziness) but this is minor compared with results.  QT interval overhyped.  Vastly improved energy, activation, mood and thinking.  Previously I had to abort medical studies due to illness.  After 7 years out of work, I have been able to return to study a Masters degree.  Remember people to SLOWLY do anything to do with dosing! (titrate over weeks/months).  Take REGULARLY (same time each day with food, don't miss).  Has no weight gain, good for blood lipids/sugars.  My turnaround in first month was remarkable; like an awakening.  Averaged 5 hours sleep but not manic.  Best I've been for 20 years.  If can't tolerate ziprasidone, next best is aripiprazole.  Try everything else, then try the best: ZIPRASIDONE!

I'm tired of feeling so blah all the time. no fun without the highs. I don't miss the lows though at all. It has kept those away so I might just cut back on my mg. Have to talk to my Dr. about it. All in all it's a decent med for bi-polar manic depression. It deffinately helps stop hallucinations.

The psych decided to give me Geodon to boost Pristiq to help my depression as I am not getting complete relief with Pristiq.
I took Geodon for a total of 4 days.  I was off from work all week because of Geodon.  The first 2 days I took 20mg and felt as if my equilibrium was off & I was off-balance.  Also, for someone who goes to bed by 9:00pm every night, I was up until 1:00am all 4 nights, and even with 6 hrs of sleep, I felt fine the next day.  Everything about what I did and felt was out of character for me.  By the time I hit day 4, I was in the emergency room.  My blood pressure increased to 188/110, I had chest pain, and experienced a day-long panic attack.  It's been 2 weeks since I stopped taking Geodon and I still am experiencing chest pain.  My psych had me stop Geodon and now wants me to take Abilify.  He says that after Geodon, the chest pain I feel is a symptom of a manic episode.  Funny... I NEVER experienced a manic episode in my entire LIFE and it wasn't until I took Geodon that I did. 
I need to go see a regular MD to make sure there isn't any permanent cardiovascular damage, as I still feel awful.  This drug is dangerous in my opinion.  If your doctor prescribes this for you, be sure you are monitored VERY carefully.  This is not a drug you mess with at all."

I was previously on a low dose of Abilify. And let me tell you, Geodon has made my moods so stable and I actually let things go with my mom when we fight. I used to fight with her every day, and they got really bad. But now I just let things go real easy. 
Thing is, the side effects are RIDICULOUS on me. It started with me not hearing my alarm in the morning and waking up late... only to still be in sleep mode for the next 4 hours. Ever woken up and you can't keep your eyes open because you're so tired? Multiply that by twelve and add puffy, bloodshot eyes. I still haven't woken up to a day where I'm not tired. And I'm usually really good with that kind of stuff. And the dizziness... oh my gosh. It's really bad. I've been on tons of medications for ADHD and Bipolar, never have I had side effects like this.

If it helped at all, it was because I slept throughout the entire day and was not mentally present in the hours that I was awake.  I struggled with debilitating exhaustion, inability to concentrate, involuntary head movements, and muscles seizing among many other adverse effects for several months. Finally, after having a small seizure during an exam, I decided enough was enough and gradually lessened the dosage over the period of a week until I wasn't taking any at all.  It took several weeks for the effects to wear off, and thankfully none of them have reoccurred.  But I would suggest extreme caution when deciding to take this drug.  In addition to being expensive and incredibly difficult to handle, it didn't seem to solve or treat the mood swings-- only knock me out to the point where I didn't have the wherewithal to feel much of anything.

I also would twitch and tense my leg muscles as I tried to relax. Over 4 months of taking it I became emotionally numb, very quiet, and distant from my family. I also required 9-10 hours of sleep at night. When I tried something else I was dizzy for three days like I was withdrawing from it.

When this happens it can lead to shortness of breath, diareah,changes in mental status and irregular heartbeat. However you can have your doctor first check to see if you are low in magnesium, then , if you are low in magnesium, your doctor can prescribe the right kind of magnesium( pill supplement and food high in magnesium, such as spinach, almonds, cashews, soybeans, etc.) Then this approach, I think,  will work very well( as I have tried and seems to be working) . Another HUGE BONUS is that you do not gain weight on this medication! As a matter of fact , I was on Zyprexa , but on Zyprexa I gained 50 LBS.But on Zeldox , (ZIPRASIDONE-ORAL-only 20mg.) since I have been on it( 10 weeks), I have lost 20 lbs.

The med is to expensive, going to the doc and counselor is exspensive I really think its all about the money and not my health.

In bipolar(which I don't think I am) I experience hypomania the most so could it be more me being hyperactive as one would be with ADHD, yeah think so.  Im quit taking it and I will be back to my old self soon. Doctors are a big waste of time. Screw the labels I just want to get better and enjoy my life and have others around me enjoy me again...

I took one tablet and it made my facial muscles freeze to the side, my eyes roled to the back of my head. My jaw was stuck so far to the side that my gums started bleeding from my teeth pushing into them so hard. I started spitting blood. It was all so uncontrollable im just scared for my life right now. I thought I had serious brain damage. Luckily for me the symtoms wore off. But I dont know if they might come back or not. Im not bipolar and I dont have a mental illness. Taking this drug was the worst mistake of my life. And I was told it was a harmless medication for sleeping like seroquell. It ended up being a bleepin nightmare. This all happened to me yesterday and today. I went into the ER. My doctor is now telling me I need an MRI of my brain. I might have serious brain damage. All I can do is warn people out there. Before you take this consider the side effects. They are as serious as anything. Id rather be dead than experience that torment that this drug inflicted on me.

The therapist was thinking I had shades of being bipolar and this drug was starting to be used as a mood stabilizer. I thought it was a miracle. I felt like my real self again, happy, laughing and was even able to take my young daughter on a week-end trip. (The only time I've been well enough to take her anywhere.) I had no side effects, it was easy to take, but it stopped working after 3 months. I was crushed and back in the abyss again.

NONSTOP~!  After exhausting the ER with a trip a month and my Doctor's comprehensive tests, which showed nothing, we came to the conclusion that Geodon may be the culprit.  Have reduced meds slowly from 180 a day (topped at 200/day for a short period) down to 80, headaches are still there!  No one told me the consequences of getting off this stuff.  On top of the headaches, dry heaves, body aches, muscle jerking, it's been hell so far.  My Doctor (primary physician) has been researching this drug non stop and we hope to find an end to the pain.  My Psych doctor can't understand what I'm talking about, she's not heard of weaning off this drug being so difficult.  I know it's not just me.  

So far tho I'm adjusting to the upper doses of Seroquil to compensate for the Geodon and it's taking care of the mental issues for which I'm grateful.

However, everyone MUST be warned about the incredible difficulty PHYSICALLY getting off this drug.  Had I know it would be this painful and difficult I might have preferred the mental issues to dealing with this severe chronic pain every day.

Good luck and think twice about using this drug. "

To get to the point, I have mood & thinking issues maybe part bipolar or part schizoid or some combination.  Geodon / Ziprasidone is a good medicine.  I have had better results, though, with a newer drug called Invega / Paliperidone.  They work very similarly and are in the same class of drugs.  The biggest difference, I think, is that Invega uses technology that lets the drug be released over a 24 hr period which helps manage symptoms better.  Due to the difficulty in diagnosint mental illness, I think in many cases people need to try combinations of drugs untill they find what works best.  I am on Invega 6 mg (switched from Geodon), Depakote ER 1500 mg, & Cymbalta 60 mg.  I think of it as attacking coexisting problems from multiple directions to be free or close to free of symptoms.  Good luck with your treatment..  Remember, Geodon is good but ask about Invega."

I have been taking Geodon 80mg twice daily for years.  It is pretty effective at controlling my psychotic symptoms, anger, fear, etc. The only side effect I have noticed is that is makes me fall asleep. I've tried lower doses but symptoms came back. The sleepiness is intense and unpredictable. I often have to pull over the car if I'm driving because of it. After a short nap I'll be okay. The episodes of passing out made me lose my last job. Overall the side effect (sleep) controls my daily activities. Pretty rotten, but better than being controlled by a Demon.

I'm waiting for the doctor to call me back.
He's also on Clonazapam (Clonopin) and Depokote. He's MR and ADHD with serious behavior problems.  He's been hospitalized recently due to behaviors.  I've had to take off work constantly and I'm down to 6 days.  after that I don't get paid anymore. I ready to 302 him if he has another episode and just leave him at the hospital until they find a medication that works. I heard Lithium works well with Depokote.

140$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/25/2019 11:53:36 AM$Reviewer: Jenn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$So I just started taking Geodon 40mg at night about 2 weeks ago.  I feel better overall except the first few days I had severe nausea and just didn't feel right.  I know alot of people take it twice a day but I am scared that if I take it in the morning that it will make me super tired.  I was on zyprexa before this and gained a bunch of weight and my total cholesterol and LDL shot through the roof and I wound up in the hospital due to heart palpatations and chest pressure.  I am only 52 and my stress test was negative but that was why my medication was changed.  I have bipolar 2 not 1 and have some hypomania but no full blown manic episodes.   I do feel like my muscles hurt but they also put me on lipitor because of my cholesterol being so high which it wasn't prior to taking zyprexa.  I got really bad tartive dys with abilify and rexalti.  I was smacking all the time like a little old lady with no teeth.  No TD so far with the Geodon but I really want to keep my dose low if I can so that does not happen again.  Ingrezza did nothing for me at all.  I am also on lamictal and effexor and have to take meds for sleep as well or I would be awake 24x7.  I am very hopeful for weight loss on this medication and for my cholesterol to improve. I don't feel as flat and tearful as I did on zyprexa so that is good.  My appetite is much less and I try and drink a Gatoraide or poweraide daily to make sure to get some electolytes in me.  It seems to help.  Anyone else taking it just at night or should I take 20mg twice daily for better effect?  Thoughts...

I'm a junior in high school, which means homeroom starts at 7:30. My bus comes at 7, so I wake up at 6, using my alarm. Not only have I nearly missed the bus because when I get up to turn off the alarm I fall back asleep, but I can barely keep my eyes open! My friends have even commented that I randomly fall asleep for a few seconds on the bus and I have nearly fallen down the stairs at school! At my school, there are eight classes, each split into two mods. During 1-2, I don't have a class. I have had to use this time to SLEEP instead of WORK. I got marked absent because I was so tired I couldn't stay at my homeroom to wait to check in and I just had to go to the school cafe and sleep. I was OUT. My friends barely roused me in time to go to class and I was still late. Not only is this pill hindering my schoolwork, it's making things DANGEROUS! I can barely keep my eyes open when going up or down stairs, walking up the hill to the bus stop, and trying to sit down. I would NOT recommend this pill AT ALL unless you ABSOLUTELY need it!

My legs were the most affected; the leg spasms were so bad I was unable to sit at all and had to be medicated in order to sleep.  My wife was not able to sleep with me because the spasms never subsided when I was sleeping. After 4 months I had to be hospitalized to come off Geodon due to the effects of the drug.  I continued to have muscle spasms attributed to Geodon that lasted over a decade and still happen from time to time.  This is only my experience but I believe it should be taken into consideration before starting this drug.

Therefore, 3 days isn't an accurate time to say Yeah or Nay!.  However, thus far, it seems to help, but I wanted to comment on the vast amount of patients on here about their Medical Care.  At some point, there has to be a time that you take control of your health.  I'm reading some of these comments, and I'm appalled by so many of you that are ""afraid to say something to your dr!""  Are you completely serious that you would allow a Dr. to dictate what you feel or how you feel on a medication.  If you are NOT comfortable with the results, TELL YOUR DR. THAT YOU WANT TO STOP - PERIOD!  You rather stay on a medication that is making your physically and mentally sick because they said so.  Are you kidding me right now!  If you don't take responsibility for your own Mental Health, don't expect to get good results.  I've told my Dr. NO TO MANY DRUGS BECAUSE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS.  AFTER A WHILE, I DISCARDED HER AS MY PYSCH DR.  NO ONE IS GOING TO KEEP ME ON A MEDICINE THAT IS MAKING ME SICK - DR. OR NO DR. FIND SOMEONE ELSE AND TAKE CONTROL AT SOME POINT FOR YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE!  It's ridiculous what I'm reading by some of you - COMPLETE INSANITY!  I found a Dr. that was AMAZING "

Geodon has really helped me.  Since starting it I have joined an exercise class and undertaken a lot of projects that I had been avoiding.  I am not overweight but had not been motivated to exercise until starting this medication.  I am also on Brintellix and take Deplin and OmegaBrite fish oil. Prior to starting Geodon I was paranoid and sensitive.  Once I started taking Geodon I felt clear headed and little things did not bother me. It has helped me immensely.  I did notice that when I tried increasing the dosage that it made me too tired.

Geodon has been one of my most reliable medications.  I used to take 80 mg which with depekote was sedating. Switched to latuda which saved my life and was able to go down to 40 mg of geodon. Sometimes take an extra 20 mg before bed when I feel fragile and to get a good night's sleep. Also lamictal is critical for depressive piece. HUGE DISCOVERY I developed neuropathy in my feet and when looking for a cause my doctor found out I had a B12 deficiency as well as a MTHF gene mutation. BOTH conditions can cause severe mental illness including bipolar. I STRONGLY encourage anyone being treated for a mental illness to get blood drawn to check for these conditions. They are very common especially in people with mental issues, are easily treated and can make your meds work better. In just 6 weeks, my B12 is normal, I'm getting treated for the MTHFR, my feet feel better and I feel much better mentally. Life changing!

Unfortunately, the grogginess in the morning was over the top! I went to class in my slipper/boots and couldn't figure out why the floor was so slippery, because the slippers didn't have rubber tread. I also was talking louder than normal and not realizng it, and everything felt surreal and off-kilter.  was yellng into passing traffic, I'd say almost hallucinating, yet I've never had that issue before, ever. I stopped it due to the goofy feelings and strange sensory distortions.  Now don't let this stop anyone, it wasn't the right rx for me. it might just be the sooper dooper wonder rx for someone else.

Go to the best Psychiatrist you can. 80 % of family (general) doctors receive only cursory training  in prescribing psyco-active meds. They haven't learned the subtle and not so subtle behavioral changes that can occur. I took Geodon (2 -80mg /day) for about five years. While I was taking it I could not see the changes. It did not make me sleepy, drunk, or any other obvious bad symptom. I did not laugh or cry for 5 years.  It's hard to explain but nothing just ""occurred"" to me. List of some of the things that didn't occur to me: proper hygiene, to get new shoes when mine had holes, to clean my house, to eat anything other than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, to get legal help to save my house when my step-mom passed and by far the worst: I didn't pet my dog or cats during that time and I am a hopeless animal lover. I have 3 college degrees and post-graduate work. One of these degrees is in Psychology. I worked at a mental health facility for two years. If I could have objectively observed myself I would have been shocked. All my family and friends had moved or passed away so there was no-one to observe the changes. By sheer luck my insurance changed and no longer covered Geodon ($400+ per month) so I stopped taking it. Now I'm alive again! I've lived with hallucinations for over twenty years. I don't have ""scary"" ones I just get overwhelmed sometimes which can lead to a panic attack. I have yet to try a med that has an effect on the hallucinations where it is even remotely worth putting up with the usually severe side-effects. People with extremely severe problems to the point where they are living no kind of life might very carefully try lower doses of Geodon. Good luck and God bless.

I take 20 mg with breakfast and 80 mg with dinner. If I take too much during the day, there is a sedating effect - we had to work our way through that. Interestingly, I still have to take ambien a few times a week to sleep even with the Geodon at dinner. I have not had any significant weight gain or loss with it. It has been very effective for me, and I have been very stable while on this medication. I do have to take the Geodon and lamictal at least 2 hours apart, otherwise I have real difficulty sleeping. My doctor can't explain to me why that is, but I simply adjust my schedule if needed. I also exercise regularly, eat a good diet, and see my doctor consistently.

I suffered a very bad dystonic reaction, was diagnosed with this at the hospital.  My head would go back and I lost control of my body - it was like a seizure, I was twitching and shaking all over, meanwhile I was terrified, conscious the whole time, I thought I was going crazy and my life was flashing before my eyes. Paramedics had to come and wheel me out to administer benadryl for it to stop. This happened to me twice, the second time I went to the ER because I was around others who were grabbing my body, trying to stop the shaking. A week before this reaction, I was very shaky and trembly. I was on it this for about 3 weeks. It was fine at first but I felt a weird pain in my brain. People commented that I seemed very ""jumpy."" I began drinking because I was scared - I didn't think to connect that the medicine was causing this. The ER told me that Geodon must be a relatively new drug, no one had heard of it there, but they said to get off it right away. I was shaky for days after and I still am having nightmares over what happened. 
If any of you experience shakiness on this drug, or people think you are jumpy, call your doctor right away - and take some benadryl. Benadryl is oddly the remedy used by paramedics to treat ""dystonic reactions"" - and the paramedics told me that they respond to these reactions constantly. You don't want to go through this, and please be warned."

Mentally I feel like myself before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but there are side effects that I have to cope with and also being on it I have developed mild tardive dyskenisia and generalized anxiety disorder. Although doctors say to take this medication with food I NEVER do and I never will. When I take it with food I become ridiculously fatigued to where I need to immediately go to sleep. I become dysfunctional. I always wait to take the medication until at night before I go to bed and one hour or more after I have eaten. I also have to carefully time myself from when I take the medication till when I need to wake up. If I don't get at least 9-10 hours of sleep I will pass out and feel very weird for the rest of the day. I've passed out in the shower several times from this, a couple times hitting my head and having to be hospitalized. Very inconvenient considering I am a working college student. Strange to say, but this medication has both saved and ruined my life. I've tried other meds and this is the only one that makes me feel mentally normal. I am managing my life now, taking it day by day, but it's no way to really live and I hope one day I can come across a better medication that at least doesn't cause the sleep problems and fainting. At least with this medication it has allowed me to so far successfully complete several semesters of college, have a part time job and have a normal social life with a loving boyfriend. Only very close friends and family know that I am struggling with these issues and my mental illness is very much hidden with this medication which I am thankful for. It is nice that to most of the world I just seem like a normal every day girl in her 20s. I just wish I could feel that way too.

I had a wonderful MD in Ft Wayne who took wonderful, appropriate care of me for 20 years.  He diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and panic disorder.  I took Xanax, Vistaril oral and an anti-depressant. I had to move because I needed to be near my family.  For a while I drove back to my MD, but after 2 years I had to stop.  I went to a Psychiatrist recommended by my Psychologist who said my MD had misdiagnosed me.  He said I had the new popular disorder, BI-POLAR DISORDER.  He didn't say 1 or anything else.  Just bi-polar.  He put me on Geodon at an extremely high dose.  240 mg daily.  He made me take it for more than 6 years.  Pfizer had been supplying Geodon for me for free, and when they discontinued that service, I had to stop taking it.  I tapered down my dose one pill at a time, gradually.  There are no places that I can find what may happen when you go off this very bad drug after long term use.  My hair follicles used to be thick and coarse.  Now they are fine and brittle.  It is also falling out by the handful.  I have numbness and tingling in my fingers that is quite painful.  My skin feels slimy, and when I shower, soap bubbles appear without using soap.  I feel electric shocks in my neck and jaw and brain.  I am extremely anxious, and have more than usual problems falling asleep.  My teeth are losing their enamel, and my nails on hands and feet are very thin, soft, growing irregularly, brittle, and growing hang nails daily.  They are very sore.  This is not a good drug.  I didn't read my patient information sheet because I was so zombied out when I went to him.  I trusted him to know how to use this drug.  It isn't for mood disorder really.  It was designed to help with movement disorders.  I have lots of anxiety, but I am not agitated.  I sit calmly.  I don't have jerky motions in my face or arms.  I wasn't told to take it with food.  I didn't know it wasn't meant to be taken for a long term. Bad experience

I had to withdraw from my college courses for a semester and I would fall asleep at work. After a while I started taking it with dinner, and I would sleep through the night and although it was very difficult to wake up in the morning, I was at least able to function during the day. I was much more even temepered and it did control the severe ups and downs, but what I did not like was that my body was addicted to it (whether it was an actual physical addiction or mental addiction, I have no idea,) however, I remember it was a holiday weekend, I had run out of refills and I was awake for 3 days. I felt like I was high on drugs. I literally had an out of body experience during these days and it was difficult. It got to the point, if I didnt take the geodon I wouldn't be able to sleep. I came off of it last February (2013) and was prescribed it again yesterday. Being off of it was not easy and my life was incredibly difficult. The side effects are worth it to me, although this time I will only be using it until I'm at a therapeutic dose of lamictal and keep it between 2-40mg/day.

I took it because I had a manic episode that lasted a couple of months. The only side effect I experienced when initially starting this drug was tiredness. After a month or so it wore away as my doctor lowered my dose and I got used to it. Other than the tiredness, this drug has been a MIRACLE for me. I have no side effects and I am much more calm. I am able to be myself again, and return to a completely normal life. :) Try Geodon, give it a few months to kick in! It's the best.

At first I had an extreme dry mouth and a swollen tongue, restlessness and then muscle restricting. I take 160 mg. Now I have an extreme problem waking up in the morning. It literally takes 2-3 hours to fully wake up. When I have to take my dog out for a walk early in the morning I feel as though I will just fall down on the ground and go to sleep. But it does help my moods and depression. Once in a while I'll get really depressed and start to cry. When I was on Abilify I gained 30lbs. And felt stupid I couldn't even think anymore. I was just numb. Geodon is good for me if I never had to wake up early. I'm in the process of experimenting with taking it a different times of the day to see if that might help.

She was hoping it would help my flatness. I felt somewhat better, but my speech became very strange/difficult to understand. My face made movements I didn't try to make, around my mouth. When I went off almost exactly a year ago with my psychiatrists' agreement I lost an entire week. I know only what others have told me - seems I split my time in sleep or the restroom (different issue, I think, realized later what that issue was, and that it was probably confusing me a lot). Not sure if I ate much of anything, but apparently I managed to call in for anything I was supposed to do that week, and that my coworkers thought there was something odd about what I said when I called in on my work shift - I didn't find out what. The first day I could remember I was very confused, and my mother happened to call. I asked why it was so dark out in the afternoon, having trouble realizing it was ~8pm when I thought it was ~3pm. My dad came and picked me up to stay with my parents a few days until I wasn't all confused. They said I could hardly get my mouth to cooperate to eat anything. I was still having a lot of difficulty trying to speak, but that wore away some - I'm better, more understandable than then, but still have difficulty speaking and being understood. I have very poor prospects of finding a job like this.

Although, it is not a quick solution. You have to be patient and give it a long time to work.  It does have side effects.  This review tells how I worked around them.  I was on Geodon for my mixed, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder for over seven years.  In combination with Zoloft, it did a wonderful job of containing my up and down cycling.  I also have ADD and, with the Geodon, I was finally able to succeed at finishing my dissertation and continuing as a university professor.  It gave me back my life.  Since my body requires more medicine dosage than normal, I was on a mega dose.  I had to take a separate medicine to control the twitches, but that worked.  I am not married, but could imagine there would be much less sex drive.  Geodon stays in your system for a long time.  You have to be patient with it at first, because it takes sometimes over a month to have it built up in your system.  On the other side, it is not as touchy, if you delay a dose.  It does not make you manic right away.  And tappering off or stopping will cause delayed mania later.  It does have the effect of making people super drowsy, when taken once per day.  I had to space my four pills: 1 with breakfast, 1 with lunch, 2 with supper.  With the last dose, I had to take it with supper because then I would be really tired and ready for bed about 4-5 hrs later. With the weight gain, I tried four other medicines for my mania before I went on Geodon over the time it took me from the first med to Geodon, I gained 20lbs, but stayed at that weight for the next 7 years.  Pharmacological, the only things I had to adjust were taking a cold med that was for people with high blood pressure and being careful to eat a meal when taking it in large doses or with another stomach-bleeding medicine, like Ibuprofen. I took it successfully for over seven years, until I went through the neurochemical changes of menopause.

I've been on it for going on 4 years, and I have been completely symptom free, I no longer experience debilitating lows or manic highs. I'm also a recovering substance abuser, will be celebrating 4 years of sobriety in August,Geodon helped get me sober without I think I would be dead. I use to take it with Lamtical, and was taken off of it about a year ago. I'm no stranger to stays at the  hositpal due to my condition, I use to have psychotic features that were exacerbated by my drug use. The only down side is I find it hard to cry. I cry maybe once a year if that. Most days I'm in a fairly good mood never extreme in one direction or another. This July my psychiatrist is going to be tapering off the medication. I want to see if I can handle being off of medication, if I have complications ,I have no problem going back on Geodon. Geodon has been a life saver, and I'm very thankful I was put on. Everyone's reaction will defer, so you have to see for yourself. And in no way do I recommend you go off of it without a doctor's strict supervision. Good luck!

I had not been on Geodon long, and he said that’s a lucky thing. He said if I’d have stayed on Geodon a decade, I would “be a slobbering zombie”. If that shocks you, it did me, as well. Do NOT take this poison. Eat organic because pesticides and GMO foods are making you sick. This is your wake-up call.

227$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/16/2013 1:48:47 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$While inpatient at a psych hospital for severe depression/suicidal ideation, a doctor added a low dose of Geodon (taken in the evening) to the anti-depressants I was already on (Effexor and Wellbutrin). The first couple of nights, I was extremely tired the next morning and unable to get out of  bed the until close to lunch time. By the third day, sleeping was no longer an issue, and I felt a bit jittery. The fourth day, I felt like my heart was beating fast, and after lunch, I had a full blown panic attack - racing heart, uncontrolled sobbing, hyperventilating, sweating, muscles clenched - I have never in my life experienced a panic attack, so I can only conclude the Geodon caused it. I quit taking it, and in a couple of days, was feeling calm again. I know everyone reacts to medication differently, and it seems to help some people, but I always thought most side effects were mild - nausea, insomnia, constipation, etc. - I didn't know it could make me feel like I was going to die! It was not an experience I would wish on anyone. This is a very powerful drug and should be taken with extreme caution.

The only problem with this medication is getting off of it, the withdrawal symptoms are horrendous. Even weaning down gradually I had no sleep and headaches along with anxiety that was helped by klonpoin. And I also gained in excess of 100 lbs on this medicine that I am now working to get back off. If you are considering this drug, I would think about long term consequences of how this will affect you and if it's worth it when you eventually come off of it (some people never do and they are fine with it) For me it worked well until the weight gain and withdrawal, but it helped me while I was on it. I hope this helps someone else thinking of trying this drug!

After being on 20mg this pill for four days to help with depression and anxiety (I have never been diagnosed with Bipolar, but we were trying to discover if thats what I had), this pill induced psychosis, put me in the hospital, and gave me the movement disorders; dyskinesia, akathisia, and Dystonia. I have had to quit work, postpone school, been on disability, and have had to work with a neurologist for the past eight months to undue the damge this pill has done to me--some of which may be permanent. I know everyone experineces medicine differntly, but this pill has not been around long enough and does not have the research to back up it's claims.  If you have had problems tolerating other medications, PLEASE DO NOT take this pill. I may be in the minority when it comes to getting tons of side effects off of every pill, and I may be that one in a million for whom this pill did not work. If you could see what I have had to endure this past year, however, I think you would agree that this pill is best left for only the most severe cases. Taking this pill has been the only regret I have in life and I want to make sure no one needlessly takes this pill ever again. I wish you happy mental health and good luck if you take this pill, you're going to need it.

It gave me sever anxieties yet took my ability to laugh, cry or feel anything away. After taking it for over a year I requested to be taken off and was weened down. Two to three days after my last dose I started having trouble walking. My muscles became stiff and I have this heavy, insane sometimes painful numbness all over my body. It's even moved into my arms and hands. Sometime along the way my nerves got irritated and I can feel them from my neck to my tailbone and up and down both arms and legs. The right leg is the worst for some reason. Little to say I have no strength or energy what so ever and am now basically disabled. I called my doctor when it first happened and was told it was not a side effect but then after a visit to the hospital and looking up the sever side effects on line I went in and saw her where she still denied it could be and has done nothing to help me. It has now been 3 month of living in actual hell. I have no job (had to quit my part time one when this started). I have no insurance and so can't get a Dr. to see me. I'm trying to go thru the state but it is taking forever. So wish there were something that could be done I just can't take it much longer. This is truly worse then hell.

I think most of these super ultra 'wonder drugs' are a load of shit.

At first it was horrible--my anxiety was through the roof, I felt for the first time in my bipolar II addled life, completely crazy. I never got suicidal, but I thought that if something happened that killed me it wouldn't be so bad. I was taking 80 in the morning and 80 at night. This went on for about six months. (I should add that the moment I started taking it I realized my life was going nowhere and immediately got a rewarding full-time job. The anti-depressants I had been on had been blinding me to the reality of my financial situation.) Then we switched to Lamictal, which left me a little hypomanic, so we started with Geodon again at low doses along with the Lamictal. Gradually I was able to increase again until now I'm back at 20 in the morning and 140 at night. As long as I don't miss a dose I'm pretty rock solid. Every once in a while I get anxious--brought on by external stressors, usually--but I've found relief in yoga, brisk hour-long walks, and back scratches by a loved one. (Yes, that last one really helps!) If you get prescribed this, hang in there! It's worth it. I should add that you have to take the evening dose at the right time, sometime between 6:30 and 7:30 in the evening. Too early and you fall asleep, too late and you're up til 3am. (I've heard that's true for most people, but your circadian cycles must affect it, too.)

It is dangerous! I find that doctors give this medication out too frequently to people who do not have the correct symptoms for needing the drug. I had serious side effects including severe tremors, night sweats, tardiv dyskinesia, hallucinations, and irregular heartbeat. It was a nightmare. I did not in fact need this drug. I immediately asked to be taken off, the doctors refused. I hope this drug is looked into more and problems fixed for the patients sake. People suffering mental problems like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder deal with enough heartache that they cannot help! And after 13 years of suffering, I was reevaluated as an adult, I am NOT bipolar at all.

The side effects were horrible! If I went even an hour without my dose, I would be getting what I was then describing to my doctor as ""Volts of electricity running through my brain"" I see now on here for this & other similar meds, people are calling them brain zaps. My doctor said that this was not an actual side effect of the drug & that it was literally ""All in my head"" The only reason he willingly took me off of this medication despite my pleas, was because my face had begun to freeze in one position. I looked as if I'd had a stroke & it took almost 6 months of being off of the Geodon before I was able to move all of the muscles in my face again. Coming off from this was terrible because of these ""Brain Zaps"" I did not know what was going on half of the time (constantly in a dazed state) & was a single mother of 2 children at the time. I am so thankful that my mother was living with us at the time to help with the kids while I dealt with all of these side effects & withdrawals. If you have a choice to take any other medication but this one, my advice would be not to take the Geodon!"

It changed my life! you want to get out of bed, exercise and it  controlled my ocd, yelling at my loved ones. My family noticed such a different person I have become.  In Nov my Multiple Sclerosis was acting  up so I asked my doctor to increase my dose to 80mg at that dose I became very anxious so he prescribed Vallium which made me cry all the time, then ativan made me cry all the time, then Klonipine same effect so come to find out I have sensitivities to Benzodiazpines they made me cry, anxious and have thoughs of suicide I then went to 20mg of Geodon and I had a doctor give me Librium for stomach problems. He told me it wasn't a Benzo come to find out it was! When I was sitting in my car in the garage with it running anticipating doing  the worst thing imagineable!! I realized I needed my Geodon the three years I have been on it I never had thoughts of suicide going to 2omg and having benzo's in my system made me crazy!! Now back on 40mg and realize how fragile Life really is to thing what my 83 year old mother and my daughter,son, husband and most of all my beautiful seven year old Lab would do without me. Try this drug it really does work!! Give it a chance and if you suffer from BiPolar and have no  children living at home and suffer from other diseases like me with my MS get a Lab the are the most loyal and best friend you could have they are your walking buddie every day so it helps with the weight loss!!

It does not work with every body chemistry, but when it does, you get your life back. It absolutely crushes my mania, irritability and suicidal ideations. 

Now, side effects... oh yes. As soon as I started it, I began to rock back and forth whenever seated, and I still do. It makes me lactate slightly, which scared the hell out of me at first. Orgasm is harder to accomplish, but I'm on a cocktail so I can't solely blame Geodon (and at least I'm not a sex maniac anymore.) The really scary thing is interference with the heart's electrical impulses, although it's supposedly rare. My pdoc once upped me to a total of 180mg per day, G-d knows why, and I promptly had an abnormal EKG and a pulse that got down into the mid-40s. After a scary week during which I told my case manager I would rather die sane than live crazy, and the doctor's restoring my Geodon to previous levels (he still swears I'm the only case of that side effect he's ever heard of in real life,) my heart is all happy.

When Geodon works, it works well and remarkably fast. If you're willing to have a heart workup just to make sure the drug isn't going south on you, I definitely recommend trying it."

I had many problems with extra movements, mouth sores from the dryness, and some swallowing difficulties. My problem is now post-Geodon: I can not sleep longer than 1-3 hours at a time. I do not sleep during the day! I am wondering if this is due my course with Geodon.

I was taken off Geodon 2 years ago. When I was taking Geodon I would sleep for 10 hours, and was very sleepy soon after taking the medication, and had to be able to go to bed.
After being taken off Geodon, I immediately could not stay asleep. I would wake all night long. Now, 2 years later, I am still having these problems.  I wake every 1-3 hours all night long. I can not get back to sleep most of the time and get up frequently for an hour or so. My psychiatrist is still treating me for depression with Lexapro, but I would do anything to be able to sleep all night.  I am 61 years old.

It didn't.  Why in the world would they give him Geodon?  He started hallucinating, talking like the devil, cursing at the nurses, wife, & children. It's over 24 hours and he's still acting irratic.

She was put on rispidol after her father died.I felt if someone would have listened she could have been on it sooner.Her father was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and she was showing signs of this at age5. at age 9 her mood swings were unpredictable,and frequent. anything would spark them.At 9 she was put on risperdol which kept her blood sugars elevated alot.(type 1 for 14 1/2 yrs.) But geodon doesn't. The only side effect I can say we have is if we accidently run out or she forgets to take it with her-she will be up all night. She relies on this to help her sleep.After geodon- I had my sweet girl back all the time.

I suffer from schizo-affective disorder, i tried invega, it stopped working after three month's. Also i've tried abilify, doesn't work. My question to anyone out there, is there any medication's any body can consider for schizo -affective disorder, that does not have a zombie affect on you. I'm thinking about trying stelazine, or risperdal.Can any one please help.

I dropped off for one day and felt great, but got much needed non anxious sleep. Last night I took it again and again the nausea is back horribly and I can't eat a bite. At first I thought it was a virus, but it only happens when I take Geodon at bedtime. What do I do? I find nothing about this in the literature.

She told me Geodon actually caused weight loss. After further review, it doesn't cause weight loss it just doesn't cause weight gain. I took it at 6pm after dinner and was asleep 15 minutes later. I woke up at 10pm and was so dizzy I fell trying to get out of bed. I ran to the bathroom thinking I was going to vomit. At one point I was almost delirious. I finally fell asleep after a few hours of tossing and turning, being so miserable from feeling as if I would vomit and it never happened. I called my doctor immediately the next morning and asked I be taken off this drug.

I highly rate this med because it changed me around for the better.

313$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/21/2011 10:03:49 PM$Reviewer: starg8t, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$It all began about three months ago (in the middle of June, 2011) when I was prescribed 80mg Geodon 2x daily for bi-polar depression. It wasn’t until mid-July, 2011 when I moved to Texas with my two beloved dachshunds (both twins, 7 years old), when suddenly I suffered the worst panic and anxiety attack I ever had in my life.  I was filled with fear beyond belief, and it wasn’t attached to anything. It “just happened.” The anxiety was so paralyzing that I could not think clearly. I was in such a panic that that I didn’t know what to do. All I could think was, “hospital.” But, because I had my two dachshunds, I could not go to a hospital. There was no one available to watch my two dogs for me. So, in a paralyzing fit of absolute panic, anxiety and fear, I quickly placed an ad on the Internet in the hope of finding a loving home for my two dogs. Now my two beloved dogs are gone forever.  I would not recommend Geodon to anyone.  I want it out of my system immediately.  I quit taking it and now have anxiety and sweating, but I'll go though it just to get off of Geodon.  It was a disaster for me.

It was like a veil was lifted from my eyes. I could see clearly once more. I felt like a normal 21 year old young adult. I was doing fun things and not being reminded of this mood disorder that I suffer with. The unfortunate thing I learned about Geodon is it only stays in my system for about 7 hours and then I start swinging into a hypomanic/manic state again so I end up taking it 3 times a day. I don't take it in the morning other wise I will be so tired from my night dose. I am taking medications 4 times a day just to get my bipolar stable which is so frustrtaing sometimes. But The Geodon has done wonders for me and has kept me from going manic many of times.

I was diagnosted with PTSD in 06 and after seeing 4 different doctors and multiple anti-depressents I can finally say that I feel normal. The only side effect that I have noticed is feeling like I need to be doing something, but this is only when I know something is coming up on my to do list. Besides that I have more normal energy, wanting to enjoy life again, no more extream highs with energy followed by a crash and getting very upset with who ever was around me. My PTSD was due to the Iraq war and the only thing that could keep my attention was basically being an ""adrenalin junky"" as I was called by many nurses. I never took anything but my work is an Explosive Engineer, always needed something dangerous to keep my attention and focus correct. Geodon has greatly helped me fix all of my mental issues, no longer have the dreams of war, no longer have thoughts of homicide, and feel like I will finally have a normal life, FINALLY!"

I had been treated for depression and taking Celexa for 10+ years.  I gradually stopped the Celexa and began the Geodon.  We make jokes about being ""claratin clear"", it's literally like pealing away the levels of fuzziness and getting clearer.  Although I have been experiencing several troublesome side effects.  The worst is the swelling, I feel like my skin is stretched so tight, and diuretics don't help much at all.  I also have trouble breathing and wake up with my heart pounding in my ears.  I love that I feel like a normal person again, after so long, but the side effects are driving me nuts.  I can't find anything in the literature about swelling either - maybe this is the weight gain they were talking about."

I was on the drug for almost five years despite changing psychiatrists several times. I experienced extreme anxiety/panic attacks, and would sometimes have sudden almost phobic reactions to being in crowded places that I had never experienced before.

I eventually lost my job in April 2008 and have not been able to find another one; I went to rehab three times in 14 months, and the third trip came when I relapsed and was put into a medically induced coma.

On the third trip, after almost five years on Geodon, the psychiatrist switched me to Seroquel (and during those five years I had tried just quitting Geodon and found it even worse than the horrible side effects of taking it).

Since switching to Seroquel in September 2010, my anxiety and fears have vanished and I have no problems staying clean and sober. I now face the prospect of rebuilding a shattered career that may never recover.

My advice to anyone who is given Geodon is to GET A SECOND OPINION. This is a nasty, nasty drug."
329$Condition: Schizophrenia$5/23/2011 2:34:22 AM$Reviewer: DrugsKillTheyProfit, 13-18 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$4$"Geodon made me gain tremendous amounts of weight in no time flat, my appetite became that of an elephant. I constantly was to tired and lethargic to even think, let alone have rational thoughts. The simplest tasks were extremely difficult.

Doctors only treat patients with drugs. Drug companies send promoters to doctors, doctors sell the medicine/drugs, doctors invest in the drug company through stocks.

If you want effective treatment, seek natural treatment. I guarantee you'll find natural treatments for depression, schizophrenia, you name it.

I guarantee they'll be cheaper than the drugs, doctors visits, and potential problems you could face - because drug companies don't pay for your hospital visits from THEIR drug""s side effects.

If you really want to empower yoourself, and stop being a tool for doctors and pharmacuetical companies - research the orthomlecular treatment for your illness. Oh, and please keep in mind - people who use natural treatments are ""quacks"" according to the FDA and other agencies. But I guarantee taking some St. John's Wort for depression will give you less side effects than the drugs! (Who's the real quack?)

May good bless you and help guide you through any illness this country is trying to profit off from you going through.

For those wondering. Here's the dose of meds I started at - 1,500 mg and 120 mg.

The dose I'm at now - 500 mg and 40 mg.

The dose I'll be at in no time flat - zero and zero mg."

I had to put him into a psychiatric hospital for 2 weeks to get him off this medication, which was the most devastating thing I have ever had to do.  He is now 15 and taking Adderall, guanfacine, Depakote and Trazodone.  He gets great grades, is self confident and full of life.  Trial and error with these meds.....it just takes time and patience.

Started on 20mg for two weeks and didn't feel any different until my fourth week on 40mg; by the time I reached 60mg I began to feel much better, seeing myself for the first time as one is suppose to feel. However I must say that either my body was becoming immune to it, or 60mg just wasn't work for me now into my fifth month. My psychiatrist then split the Geodon into parts. I'd remain taking the 60mg with dinner, but now added 40mg to take in the morning. I was told this would help somewhat with the depression state I was in, so have been splinting the dosages twice a day and I noticed that I am feeling a little better. My only issue with this medication is that it has made me gain weight so rapidly at such a small window of time.

I was walking with a friend when I started walking funny, like my right leg was longer than my left. I just went home and slept it off right away. on the second day of taking it. In the middle of class my face started to make a frowning gesture without my approval. It was somewhat embarrassing and scary. I called my Father and he told me that we'll have to lower the dose to 20mg. Every time I have a problem with the meds I just sleep it off. It's soo easy to sleep and almost hard to stay awake sometimes. I guess it makes me feel kinda woozy. If it's suppose to knock me the hell out, then it's doing a fantastic job. It feels like my brain is drowning sometimes. maybe it's just me.

The first few days I was sleeping non stop. When I started getting used to the effects it wouldnt put me to sleep so much. But then I could not get up in the morning to go to school, or function. I tried getting off it once cold turkey and I almost went completely insane: extreme anxiety, couldnt stop hysterical crying,depression, and insomnia, it took me about a week to get back to a somewhat normal state. My doctor kept upping the dosage since I couldnt stay asleep anymore, and in the end I was falling asleep everywhere, and now had to go to independent studies due to loss of ability to wake up and stay up. Horrible medicine. I dont want anyone else to suffer the same.

The flu symptoms kept continuing for another week. It wasn't until I got on this site and read someone's post about problems with the drug. The diahrea, cramps, leg pain, nausea.... I had all of that! I went off the Geodon and feel great physically. But I'm sad b/c the Geodon DID improve my mood...could not live with the side effects though! And I lost over 11 lbs from being sick! Hope this helps someone else. All drugs are different and side effects for everyone are different. Back to the Doc. :)

I shook and twitched all day. And eventually, I had a seizure and was directed to stop. Even now that I have been off of this drug for over a year, I still twitch on occasion. The ER doctor said it is still in my system and that I just have to wait it out. I am back on Depakote and unfortunately, it does not work as well.

There were a few side effects.  He was sluggish in the mornings, and had mild muscle aches.  Then he was told to up the dosage from 80mg a day to 160mg a day.  As soon as he did, he stayed dizzy, had a sense of hopelessness, felt sudden dread.  This went on for 3 days.  He just sat and cried and said he didn't know what to do.  I took him to the ER because of the dizziness.  Dr. ran blood test and took a CT.  Everything came back normal, so they said it was the medication and to immediately stop taking it.  We got home and everything seemed ok.  A couple of hours later, the dread was back.  He started crying again repeating ""I don't know what to do, I just want to die.""  I took him back to the ER and told him he was still having panic attacks and was feeling suicidal.  He is now in a mental hospital for the next 7 to 10 days.  Please be cautious when taking Geodon!

Such as headache, speech disorder, slobering or drooling, dizzyness, even hemmoraging that can be extremely painful.  I am wondering why this medication is used at all?  In my situation, of severe schizophrenic disorder, manic depression, or bipolar; my doctor seemed to expirement with ten or more prescription ""anti-psychotics"" on me.  Side effects were very troubling and long lasting, some even being permanent or not going away for years.  I am wondering why this medecine is being used at all unless it is some form of euthenasia (assisted suicide).  I can't come up with the answers to these problems right here and now, but I propose several problems or issued to think about.  It seems that the class of medication to treat bipolar symptoms, in essence problems that become too big to handle, is only punitive.  Many youngsters used alcohol and illegal street drugs to self medicate for symptoms of violent attacks or debilitating depression; in other words extreme emotional situations.  Subsequently being treated for drug addiction, or symptoms of schizophrenia that were to severe to be handled by having a few beers, going to a higher power or more powerful medication, has thus increased side effects and damage to the human body.  After all I learned to decrease my use of any and all medications, whether it be legal, illegal, or prescription strength, and try to treat symptoms with old fashioned methods of bed rest, comfort, and probably wholesome regular nutritious meals."

She was diagnosed 8 years ago at age 20 and has been moderately functional for the most until early this summer.  Graduating with her second college degree, I think the stress did her in and then failed her clinical board on top of that! (low self esteem and severe depression)
She has tried a variety of meds (Concerta, Zyprexa, Lexapro, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta) combined with Abilify. 
At present she is on Celexa(20mg)/Geodon(60mg)/Topamax(25mg) in AM and Topamax(25mg) in PM.  We will continue to monitor her experiences with this med and post weekly.

On 6/9/2010, 18 yr old son had been out w/friends all morning. His buddy brought him back to our house having a severe convulsive reaction. They thought maybe to Geodon. That seemed odd to me because he hadn't had any reactions before or had any med since last night--that I knew of. 
He looked like he was having a stroke or an overdose reaction to either RX or possibly illegal drugs. (The only other thing his friend admitted to was a Native American cigarette he had given him, Smoky Joe. An ER nurse searched the ingredients on the internet. He found no real medical concern.)
  The main ER doctor is pretty certain our son’s reaction was to the Geodon, based on the good response to the ""antidote"" they gave him. It was not an allergic reaction but another type. He explained the meds (which he had already been taking for 3 weeks) caused some type of misfiring of the nerves. 
   He had been unable to speak understandably, or control his muscle movements. His hands & neck  muscles were involuntarily contorted, & his heart rate was dangerously high. He was having convulsions, different than a seizure. He was awake, alert & responsive. I guess seizures are an in-&-out reflex of the muscles. Something I hope to never have to learn more about.
They were originally going to give him Cogentin to counteract the Geodon, but it would take too long to get from the pharmacy, so they gave him a shot of Benadryl, which worked in about 30 sec. to calm him & take away all pain. Both the ER doctor & the psychiatrist say Geodon could continue to be taken in conjunction w/another medication (possibly Cogentin?), but our son didn’t want to, nor did his Psychiatrist advise it. He prescribed a higher dose of Zyprexa (15 MG) to try, but our son is too apprehensive about having another reaction, so he chooses to take nothing & deal w/the voices.

I was taking this on top of a number of other drugs, including 200mg of Lamical daily. I have since lowered my 80mg daily dose to 60mg and now I'm at 40mg. This medication has the same sleeping coma effects of seroquel...church bells in my room couldn't wake me up. So, needless to say I don't have the ability to have a normal job and life because this stuff just takes over any ability to wake up. Since I reduced my dose to 40 mg, I am experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms & feel like I'm crawling out of my skin....similar to Lamical withdrawal. My advice, don't start taking on top of another bi-polar med if you don't absolutely need it!

It must be carefully taken and administered for proper therapeutic use. I take it for the negative side effects of my illness and it works quickly and well. However, the startup side effects are very uncomfortable and can be nasty. I was started on 60mg at night and it knocked me out and made my manic the first 3 days. After this period it made me sleepy at night and not too manic. However after about 8 hours it would clearly begin to stop working and made me agitated. So now I am on 60mg morning and 60mg after supper. It works very strangely with food. If you eat a high fat/carbohydrate meal it can make you seem a bit lethargic so I eat high fiber (fruits and veggies) and it is milder. In all it has been a lifesaver!

My cholesterol is also very high.  I have had withdrawal side effects a couple hours before my dose is due.  Have developed weird finger movements and a constant sense of restlessness.

Currently I am on a low dosage, and expect it to be raised next month. 

I am glad to see this med work, but I have a problem with the cost, my first month's dosage has cost me over $200.00, so if they raise my dosage, the price will rise accordingly. So I guess I will just have to find a way to deal with the price along with the sleep? 

I have tried about 20 other depression / ""atypicals"", etc type medications and nothing else has shown any promise, until Geodon. Currently, Geodon seems to be the only medication I have taken that shows any real promise, I am looking forward to the next few months....If it continues on this path, I will just have to deal with the cost and the sleep issues.

We have treated this with Symmetrel 100 2x and Inderal 40 2x.  I have also found that taking 150 mg Wellbutrin twice per day has helped ease this problem.

Shortly after that there was a tragic death in the family but this drug kept me feeling happy and positive. After a while the effects started to diminish so the doctor would keep raising the dosage. With that I noticed that the side effects effected my sleep if I did not take it early enough in the evening. This brings up the only problem I have with this drug; if you miss a dose you’re going to notice. If I forget to take it I will not be able to fall asleep at all, and if I still haven’t taken it after 12 hours of when I usually do I will get really sick.

I started off on a lower dose but had to increase it about a year ago due to a breakthrough episode.  I think that it causes my sugar to be out of whack sometimes as I now have some peripheral neuropathy but I am not diabetic.  This has  been a great drug for stopping manic episodes and with the increase stopped some visual sensations that I get before an episode.  It is the first thing that I take when I get out of bed in the morning.  I was taking this with Lamictal but had to discontinue that due to a rash, but I have been fine for quite a while.  It does make you sleepy at first (I take 2 before bedtime) but that does wear off after a while if you can stick with it, it is well worth the benefit.

I have been taking lithium, lamictal, emsam and xanax without much, if any, relief.  Last week I thought that I would be going into the hospital due to the irrational sense of dread/doom that I was experiencing.  I was terrifed for no reason, could not sit still, I was nearly unable to speak and I had no idea why or what to do about it. I was on the verge of an emotional, mental and physical collapse. Within 30 minutes of taking 40 mg of Geodon I could literally feel the hyper-anxiety/panic draining off me like water in the shower.  Today I am feeling great but like I am on speed that has been dosed with extra speed.  I also have had insomnia for 3 nights and a depressed appetite. But I'm not unbearably tired, I don't feel ""high"", my hands are not shaking any worse than usual and I feel mentally in control for the first time in a very long time. Maybe the other side effect is I can't stop talking.  But anything is better than what I felt last week and for the past years.  I don't know what will happen in the next few days or weeks but right now, this minute, I am happy with me and with my life.  I don't remember the last time I've felt like this. I'd like to sleep tonight but if I don't, that is okay.  The me that was lost is back. I am going to say a prayer tonight that I never lose her again."

Ive been stable for a year now no relapses. It has helped me to focus and calms me down from be anxious. The one thing I can say bad about the Geodon the my copay for the two scripts that I use each month. Can't wait for the generic lol.

My initial psychosis lasted for 2 years!; my doctor was trying to bring me out of it with Zyprexa - it failed. He then tried Seroquel - it failed. Risperdal Consta brought me out of it, but made my depression worse, plus, I gained 30lb's on it. I went off of it [Risperdal] for these reasons and ended up having subsequent episodes until finally trying Geodon. I had a minor episode on Geodon at a lower dose (80 mg) and finally worked up to 240 mg. The psychosis went away and I have absolutely no side effects! No weight gain (even lost what I put on on Risperdal) and no worsening of my depression. In fact I even think my depression has improved! What's confounding is why Geodon sales lag behind everyone else. I know why, but it shouldn't be in my opinion. I think I'll be staying on this one. Don't know what I would do without it.

He did not give me enough to get to my next appointment and I could not get a hold of him. SO I had no choice but to change my dosage to 1 pill a day,40mgs. Three days after I did this I started experiencing these bad side effects. Bad anxiety, I am VERY shaky inside and out, muscle twitching which includes my whole body and face (T.D), my mouth is moving weird, my breasts hurt very badly, can’t sleep, nausea, etc….. This started 5 days ago. The first day was the worse my symptoms slow down a bit but have seemed to stay where they are at. I have been calling all over to ask for advice since I could not get a hold of my doctor. I even went to the ER. Everyone told me I had to talk to the doctor that is treating me and there is nothing they could do AND NOT to stop the pills because my symptoms’ could get worse. I cannot wait to get off this drug and I would never recommend this drug to anyone. Needless to say I have to find a new doctor to help me off this drug since the doctor I have obviously  does not care about his patients. I am very afraid to get off this drug. I do not like the way I feel or felt. But I am scared to stay on it……………

As I am very sensitive to psych meds, my Dr. started me @1/2 the starting dose. Within 48 hours I was in the ER with a concussion. The medication gave me the worst vertigo ever and I fell over cause I stood still for too long. My BP on arrival was 80/55(was normally 115/70)and my blood sugar was so high, one nurse asked me how I could be awake. Over the course of the four months I was on the meds(w/ one decrease in dose)I suffered at least 2 injuries a week due to either vertigo or passing out without warning. I was always so weak and stiff, I didn't want to sit up, none the less get out of bed. I gained 30lbs in the first 5 weeks, despite eating very little (mostly applesauce and other things that I could drink/not have to chew. I was really just too tired to chew).My limbs felt so heavy, like they were cast in stone, that I took to sleeping on the couch just to avoid the stairs.My boss made me take FMLA time after I was rushed to the ER(for stitches in my head and burns on my hand)for one of my fainting spells (I was a line cook).When I talked to my doctor about all this(over the course of those 4 excruciating months)he told me it was impossible, those symptoms only happen to one in 10,000 people. He refused to take me off, citing that I also wasn't taking even half the starting dose. I talked to my family doctor and after what seemed like a gallon of blood's worth of tests, all negative, took myself off Geodon.All my symptoms went away within 48 after I finished weaning(except the weight I had already gained).

Throughout this time, I never felt the tiniest bit less depressed
My advice: If you experience severe drowsiness, vertigo, nausea, fainting (or any other side-effect severely) stop taking it right away. Its not going to get  better. I only mentioned the largest effects of the drug on myself I didn't mention the headaches (from dehydration) or the stuttering and tremors, etc"

I felt great, more energetic, clear headed and productive.I felt hope. Then I began to experience severe jaw clenching, headaches, stiffness, and what I termed a buzzing throughout my body.  My doctor put me on Cogentin for the symptoms which caused blurry vision and severe dry mouth.  I was told I would need bifocals.  I also began to use laxatives weekly to combat the severe constipation. After getting a second opinion I switched back to a low dose of Abilify.  I feel defeated.  Weight gain is an issue for me on Abilify and on the Geodon with the aide of diet and exercise I lost 40 pounds.  It somehow seemed to lower my appetite. I feel okay with my somewhat controlled mood swings and thinking disturbances. But nothing like the stability I experienced on Geodon

I also take two antidepresssants (Wellbutrin and Lexapro) in addition to taking Klonopin for anxiety.  What I noticed after an incident in 2004 is that I cannot handle the stress of a demanding job and was very concerned for the future.  I took assessment tests and found that although my inteliigence was intact, I realized that my capacity for stress diminished alot.  I sometimes become easily frustrated and cannot always follow direction very well like I used to.  I still worry about where my career moves will take me and financial stress is common.  It has been 5 years since I have been able to work a regular job.  I have held down at least 3 jobs at minimum wage to make ends meet, which took a very bad toll on me.

After a month of not feeling better, her psych increased the dose to 40mg twice a day. After a few weeks, she is sleeping all day if she takes the morning dose and can' sleep at night if she forgets to take the evening dose. If she doesn't take it all day, she experiences ""withdrawal"" like symptoms. Headache, anxiety thru the roof, etc. Gradually, she has become nauseated, experiences dizziness, feels like her muscles are 'clenchy' and twitch, has restless leg syndrome, gets red splotches on her face and feels as though she cannot relax. Because it was gradual for her, we didn't realize that the symptoms could be from the Geodon. But the more I read, the more I think that they are from the drug. She has a med/eval with her psych tomorrow and I hope to get her off of this. Even though she feels like it's the best MENTALLY so far that we've tried with her Lexapro, the side effects are incompacitating her and she cannot function on a daily basis. This simply is unacceptable and I will try to find her something else."

He came to me to let me know something was very wrong as he was hearing the voices. He had been becoming very upset and hostile after the first week, and not able to sleep. He ended up hurting his brother and having a panic attack. The doctors at the ER said to not let him take it anymore. His med doctor called the next day and asked us to increase it double which I refused. I would NOT reccamend Geodone to anyone unless they are under complete supervision and care of a professional for that first 1 month time frame. This is a very scary drug.

I think I actually may have felt ""normal"" for the first time in my life! Then about 3 weeks into taking it I started getting extremely sleepy during the day - to the point of falling asleep while driving my child to school. Very dangerous. I was at the time taking 40mg in the am and 40mg in the pm. I called the doc and mine was on vacation - the doc on duty cut out my daytime dose so I was just taking the nighttime 40mg. This did not help the sleepiness for the first 2 weeks, but made me go berzerk! I started feeling depressed again, I was irritable, had the racing thoughts, the whole bit. This week the sleepiness finally went away and I saw my doc today. She upped my dosage at night to 60 mg to see if I can handle it without being sleepy during the day to try to work back up to 80mg but take it all at night, hopefully without the sleepiness during the day. I hope it works, because the drug itself was doing wonders for me - but I can't be sleeping every where I go!!"

I couldn't sleep with out this medication and when I did take the medication it put me right to sleep.  Now to the better part.  When I would wake up in the morning I wouldn't have any of these side effects, however I was my normal self.  Very unusual, to say the least.  My recommendation is to not start on the medication unless you are really in need of a change.  But if you begin and need to go off for any reason expect to be up all night and for several nights with flu symptoms and severe anxiety.  Hope you found it informative.

My blood glucose levels were off the charts, and if I was even half an hour late taking the dose, I would experience withdrawal symptoms, as though it was a street drug! This past August and September, I refused to take the medication anymore, and I experienced 19 days of severe withdrawals, even after having lowered the dosage over the course of more than a month. I have been down the road of kicking drug habits in the past, and getting off of Geodon was worse than anything I've ever dealt with. And the worst part of all is that I haven't had a single psychotic relapse in the time it's been since I stopped taking the drug, but my former shrink had refused to even lower the dosage, even after I showed her what it was doing to my blood glucose. If I could, I would ban this drug from the entire planet. The ""benefits"" not worth going through the withdrawals and the worsening of Diabetes."

I experienced a side effect called AKATHISA.. where I felt physically jittery both inside and out.. had to take deep breaths even though I wasn't short of breath, couldn't stop chewing the inside of my mouth and cheeks as well as tensing my jaw and grinding my teeth. Knees, propped up on the balls of my feet, were bouncing up and down faster than I could if not in this condition..and my mental state was foggy at best.. found it hard to express thoughts.. type emails.. even put in an emergency call to my Psychiatrist.. who told me to take 100mg of Benadryl and assured me that the feeling would pass and was temporary. He has taken me off both Seroquel and Geodon. Having gone through this, I can understand how someone could become self destructive..it felt like I couldn't stand being in my skin.. I repeat this was a PHYSICAL feeling.. I was not 'imaging' it or 'out of touch with reality'.. Patients should be warned of this. I don't ever want to experience that feeling again.

I was on abilify for two years and this doesn't make me a robot. however, I was put on depakote a few years ago which made me gain 80lbs in two months,and gave me polycystic ovaries, as well as making me prediebetic.all of which went away. but i am concerned because I have  skipped a period and seem to be gaining weight rapidly. having read that it increases prolactin in females, It makes me sad because this drug really works for me mentally, but it might not be worth the risk.

First I was put on Zyprexa 7.5mg, that worked great but I gained almost 40lbs in less than two months. Not cool since I am or should I say was really fit. I was switched to Abilify.  That did NOTHING at all.  I couldn't even tell I took anything. No change at all. So then I was put on Geodon. I was told it was good for me and would lower my cholesterol.  Not that that was an issue, but anyways. I started taking it, and became very very very very very ill.  I was throwing up all day every day. I pretty much lived off of freeze pops for over a month.  I was in and out of the hospital because of dehydration once or twice a week. Sorry to say I lost all of the weight in less than a month. I asked if it was my geodon and he said that that was not a side effect. I actually was sent to the cancer unit and tested for lukemia, hepatitus, lupus and even HIV!  Very scary but none of which I had. I finally stopped taking it because I thought since I was throwing up so much that it was not even staying in me.  Immediatly I got better. Dr. said I had to take it again.  So I did three days later after feeling wonderful. And within 2 or three hours it started again. I called my Dr again to tell him I wanted to stop taking it. He said it was a coenceodence (spelling?)and to not stop it! I waited a day or two, I was fine.  Took it again and got sick AGAIN! He still thinks I had a stomach bug. I refused to take it, and he refused to see me. My new Dr. said that it is a rare side effect but it is listed.  I'm glad someone listened!

I have bouts of restlessness during the day that only seem to be getting worse. I am also on trileptal. used to be on lithium but the side effects + weight gain were too much for me. My doc says I am having tremors inside my body. used to take Inderal with the lithium to stop from shaking. Now she gave it to me again to help with this type of ""inside tremors"". Just started today with that. Hope it helps. This stuff makes me want to jump out of my skin. But every other med of this kind make you gain weight. I have gained 60 pounds in the past 1 1/2 years due to meds. I also have spinal problems and arthritis so I cannot weigh this much and its hard for me to exercise to lose it. So I will stay on the geodon and hope the upped dosage of trileptal and the Inderal help me. "

At first it worked wonders. For the first time in almost two months he was laughing, joking around and being himself that we all missed. I noticed a huge differnce right away and it worked. Although it made him anxious and jittery. When he was relesed from the hosptial he was doing well. That night though, he started getting really aggitated and anxious and couldn't handle anything. He kept complaning of feeling heavy, having panic attacks, confused and hazzy, ect. I took his car and drove him home. The next am at 7:30 he called and said he was feeling funny, worse then the night before and that he was having more attacks. He came over about 10am and hardly could walk up my stairs and was exausted. He kept saying he couldn't breath right. I took him home and his step dad and I took him to the ER. He was having reactions to the medication and was dehydrated. He felt better when we left and we went on with our day. Again, at dinner time he started acting the same. He went to bed real early and got up again real early. The third night he got really irritated, annoyed, panicy and anxious and kept saying he was going crazy. It was really quite scary. His mom called the the dr from the hosptial stay and said to stop taking it immidently. That was last night. Today he is still very stressed and anxious and feeling like crap. This is the 7th or so med he has tried in the last year and a half. Nothing has worked. But this has had the most noticable side effcts. I've read lots of horror stories from people who have had to take this med long term and I am so glad he is off of it after a week. It costs a fortune. He was wonderful health insurance and it cost 80bucks on top of the other expensive meds he is on.

I've only been on Geodon for a week and I am me again! Yahoo! I am going through an ugly divorce, was forced out of my own house and had to move where I had sisters in another state. So, my depression was worse than it's ever been. To the point I had suicdal idiation and admitted myself to a psych hospital where I was for 8 days. They put me on Lithium. I couldn't function AT ALL on Lithium. Almost wrecked my car; fell asleep sitting up during family get togethers; couldn't manage my finances; I couldn't think straight. I threw the Lithium down the toilet. We all have different body chemistry, so maybe it works for some people (Lithium) but, not me. The combination of meds I am now on are really working for me. Geodon; Lexapro; & Klonipin. Now I have energy, good clarity, and I can sleep at night. I literally pop out of bed happy in the morning. Before, I couldn't get out of bed or my house and felt totally hopeless. I hope my experience helps someone else.

Stepping up on the medication takes too long. My Dr. is having me go from 20 to 40 to 80 mg over 3 weeks and I'm just getting to 80 mg starting week three. SO MANY SIDE EFFECTS! I can't stop moving/bouncing legs. When I get the restlessness feeling, I feel like I need to be doing something. I'm anxious and paranoid. Sitting in place for extended periods of time are impossible. It also gives me fevers/sweats. My hands are almost always clammy. Sleeping is very difficult as well. BUT, enough about bad stuff. It did level my moods. It also made my sex drive go down to normal as well. Driving is a much safer and happier experience now too.

At first it was horrible, there were so many uncomfortable side effects such as muscle rigidity, having to constantly move, shakiness, and some parkinsonism. My doctor actually had to prescribe Cogentin to help with the side effects. For some reason, I stuck it out. About four months later, the side effects disapeared completely. The following two years the Geodon prevented episodes well with no side effects. However, two weeks ago I have a full blown manic episode despite my compliance with my medication. Since then, I was taken off of the Geodon and put on Seroquel. The Seroquel has many undesired side effects. I miss the Geodon. So anyhow, give Geodon a shot... it worked for over two years for me.

I am also on Lamictal currently.  It is the first time in nine months and eleven different medications, that I feel like myself again.  I am actually able to leave my house, enjoy my life and have energy.  I am incredibly sensitive to rx's, so to find anything to relieve the side effects of going off of Lithium and not have any reactions is a Godsend.  Every body is different and this drug does target a certain pathway and chemical in the brain, so it won't work for everyone.  For me, I actually have hope now that I can live with this illness.  Oh, and I've been stable for almost a month now, the longest that I've gone.

The only problem i had in the beginning was sleepiness which went away in 2 weeks.  This drug changed me from a zoombie to a fully functioning human being.  I was even able to eventually wean off my trileptal and zoloft, which made me feel even better.  This drug has changed my life for the better, I think with true clarity and can't imagine going back to those zoombie drugs like seroquel ever again.  It makes me so well that non-compliance will never be an issue.  In fact the opposite occurs, when low on pill count i replace as early as possible.  I take 160 mg a day and the hallucinations fade to the background, and i can live a good life now.

Started at 120mg now on 40mg in conjunction with Tegretol. What negative side effects are from Tegretol or Geodon I don't know but I have a lack of energy now, finding the right words is tough, loose balance sometimes, and most of all is scary that my heart feels like it races at times and a slight crushing pain in the rt side of chest now and again. It feels different than anxiety symptoms. I have been on it for 6 weeks. Considering switching but all have some side effects like weight gain and severe drowsiness. I am a light weight on drowsiness. I hate to change again and miss more summer or risk paranoia.  I take it for bipolar I (affective) disorder with psychotic features. Hope that helps.

I had to go to the ER because I had my eyes rolling back in my head and I had my tongue making me look like an idiot. What fun. I hated this drug and will never take it again. When they give you this drug they hope that the benefits will out way the side effects. Losing control of your facial muscles are serious and scary side effects. I didn't see a benefit. Those that are taking this drug please just be careful and those that are considering taking this drug I can't tell you that it won't work because who knows it very well could and work out to be the best medicine for you but just please be careful. Not that anyone asked but I ended up in the ER less then 3 days of first taking it.

One thing I wanted to mention...his doctors have warned that this drug is INEFFECTIVE if not taken WITH FOOD.One psychiatrist stated that he needs to ingest at least 500 calories when he takes it.

Then I began feeling extremely anxious. At night I felt clobbered, so extremely exhausted. Then, after about a week, when I was up to 100 mg/day, I had a distemic reaction which landed me in the emergency room. After a few days off Geodon, my Dr. reintroduced it with a medication to counter the distemic reaction. At this point I am up to 40mg/day.I still feel awful and then 2 days ago I began hearing voices. Has anyone heard of this happening? Could I be having the opposite effect from the Geodon--could it be causing psychosis? I am also taking Depakote, and was on a small amount of Clonzapin but only for a week, and my Dr. was having me go off of that. 

On the day the voices started, I had only taken .25 mg of the Clonzopan. (I had been taking .5/day for most days and at the beginning of the week had taken 1mg/day for two days--I have a history of benzo abuse, so this was all a very low amount for me and I have never suffered from withdrawal from other benzos I have taken.)

My doctor thinks the hallucinations could be from Clonzapin withdrawal, but I don't see how that could be. 

I would appreciate any feedback."

I had my best day ever yesterday! If I stay calm after my dose at night I will sleep, like a log, but if I get moving(like in the a.m., I make myself go!!),I get over the hump and am fine. So if you're like me , you may need to practice deep breathing and stretches for your night dose, and some lite stretching and gentle motions for keeping going in the a.m. 1/2 caffeine coffee helps, too! This drug is tough, but I see light at the end of the tunnel! If that changes, I'll let you know. Hope this helps someone, and thank all of you for your thoughts and reviews!
731$Condition: Manic-Depression$2/13/2008 10:55:23 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$2$In terms of ease, I had to take three 40 mg pills at different times each day.  That was annoying.  Rather than preventing anxiety, Geodon caused me to undergo extreme panic attacks, tremors, and twitches.  After a while these twitches began to involve half-second blackouts where I'd become entirely disoriented and my torso would twitch very hard.  After a conversation with my doctor I discovered that this was a type of seizure.  WOAH.  That scared me away from antipsychotics FOREVER.  If you have this twitching sensation please alert your doctor IMMEDIATELY or it could become a permanent problem.  Overall I was extremely frustrated by both the drug and my doctor's 'beat-around-the-bush' attitude about it.  This is a serious medication and should be treated with extreme caution.

My mood is very up, I have TONS of energy, I pay NO attention to negative thoughts.  All of this is great but, as a nurse, I am a bit worried about TD and wondering if any of this jittery/hyperness is TD, early.

I am much less agitated, /w less motor activity, I think clearer, and I am not as paranoid or suspicious over things so much  This is the closest thing to a panacea (cure all).  My complaint, though, is that some doctors prescripe aggressively instead of trying to find the right dose.  The best dose is usually the lowest dose that works well.  For instance, the 80 mg x 2 a day was making me very tired, so i switched to 60 x2 and i am doing much beter now.  Interestingly, it also helps treat OCD and tourettes, although it has not been approved by the FDA for that.  My OCD symptoms are less.  I think it augments (makes greater) other drugs.

I also missed a period altogether.  I take it with Lexapro, and the combination works for me, though with the weight gain that Lexapro causes, I'd like to try something else.

That was making me gain weight immensely.  The only side effect I had from Geodon is mild sleepiness and for some reason I have this taste in my mouth like I swallowed aspartame or something sweet like it. Other than that I lost 8 lbs and I am in control of the anger/mood swings. I highly recommend Geodon.

After a year I was put on Zoloft, then Lamictal.  The combination of all three are wonderful.  The only bad thing I had to say about Geodon is that I lacked emotion and had no motivation...that's where the Lamictal came in handy!!  I don't want to take any other drug.

It really stabilizes me without the weight gain I experienced on Zyprexa.  I have no side effects other than a little sleepiness either from the Geodon or the Depakote or both which is easily remedied by drinking a couple cups of coffee.  This has been a wonder drug for me.  I highly recommend giving it a chance.

769$Condition: Manic-Depression$10/25/2007 7:00:18 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $2$1$1$I was on Geodon for over six months. I struggled to get out of bed, and felt the need to hide all of my emotions. Lost any feeling of motivation and passion. Became very depressed, had the majority of the side effects. Took me almost a year, to find confidence in myself again after getting off Geodon. Everything is different for all of us, and I don't believe that Geodon was the right drug for me.

This medicine caused me to break out in cystic acne, so I took myself off of it. I stick to Lamictal, Seroquel, and Elavil.
