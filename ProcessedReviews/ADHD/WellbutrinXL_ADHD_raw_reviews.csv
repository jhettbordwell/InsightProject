10$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/15/2018 4:42:39 PM$Reviewer: SC-Scribe, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$The drug screwed up my sleep cycle, and so taking it was very difficult. I wanted to give it a fair shake on the ADD, so kept at it. Then I developed odd neurological tingling / twitches in my fingers. Didn't associate it with the drug. THEN, a horrible neurological condition struck, and I was rushed to the hospital. It was hypokalemia -- low potassium -- and it was life-threatening. Bupropion, as it turns out, is associated with this. Ironically, my business partner's boyfriend was a few months later taking it for smoking cessation; she had to drive him to the hospital for the same reason. So just be aware!
17$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/11/2017 1:00:59 PM$Reviewer: DB, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$4$Doctor gave me this to help with the anxiety that is caused by my ADHD/ADD until I could get in to see a psychiatrist. Must say it has worked wonders. The first day, it released the ADD and actually made it worse. Think of taking chains (anxiety) off the disease and letting it run wild. The second day was better. Noticed a little irritable at common tasks throughout the day. The third day, I was completely normal. I had motivation to get things done and haven't had any desire to procrastinate. The ADHD and ADD is still there and I can notice it but it doesn't make me anxious about it.

If you can stick it out for the first  week or two... It is SO worth it. I had rapid heart beat, increased anxiety, weird dreams... Just hung on and now.. After 6 weeks... I've never felt better.  Still ""me""... No zombie like feeling and just feel so much more capable and optimistic .  Even my 12 year old has noticed that I am able to step back and think before reacting .  Have also been eating better... Kills craving for pure candy and sweets... Lost 10 lbs and counting."

361$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/1/2008 1:32:18 AM$Reviewer: teppa, 35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$2$I began with shortness of breath, heart palpitations, dizziness, headaches and blurred or spotted vision. I've only been on the medication two weeks but to a point that I'm scared for my health. I've also noticed an increase in my blood pressure. Tonight while at the movies, I could barely catch my breath and my heart was beating so hard that I thought I was having a heart attack...I had to leave the theater and get some fresh air and catch my breath. Evidently  this isn't the drug of choice for me.
404$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/12/2016 6:11:06 PM$Reviewer: Taddy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$4$3$At first, I was given 100mg/day and did not notice hardly any change over the first month. (The only side-effect was a few headaches.) Then, it was increased to 150mg x 2/day, which I took for a month and though I had more energy, I didn't think it helped my Adult ADD/ADHD much (not wanting a stimulant), so I abruptly stopped taking it at the end of the 2nd month (time for a refill). I already take Zoloft for depression, which works well. A side-effect of cessation is intense fatigue/tiredness. Yet, I seem to be MUCH more distracted now (having thought I was not much more focused). Yet, I believe it must have helped me some, so I am going back on it asap!
406$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/18/2014 1:01:14 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have anxiety problems due to the combination of ADHD and Asperger's, and Bupropion has seriously helped. I have taken this my entire life, with the exception of my early years up to fifth grade. I recently went through a stint where I had tried to go off it once I had learned it was primarily an anti-depressant, and I began having problematic panic attacks and would go through periods in which I could not stop crying. Since being back on this, I must say I am satisfied with it. I have been off Concerta for a year, and Bupropion has helped me to also keep my ADHD problems(impulsiveness, hyperactivity) in check. I know this whole review probably doesn't matter too much, but I wanted to give some insight for people with ADHD who are either starting or debating starting this medication. I see a lot of reviews from people who are taking this for depression, so it'd be good to see something from someone with ADHD. There are much fewer and less present side effects than Clonidine, so to me it's a good alternative.
432$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/13/2017 6:06:13 PM$Reviewer: love, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$I started taking this medicine 1 week ago. I started hearing buzzing in my ear and ringing. And then it began to feel like I was under water. I started feeling dizzy. I would spill drinks accidentally or miss steps walking down the stairs. I generally feel as if I am not on the ground. Needless to say I threw the prescription out. If you have sensitive ears, eyes, throat or family history of seizures of other history of imbalance, ear infection, even from swimming, do not take this medicine. I thought I was going to lose my hearing today the ringing and loud noises were unbearable. That said I don't know what caused these symptoms. I liked the evenness that I felt. The health problems this medicine caused me in one week far outwiegh any benefit.
444$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$6/14/2015 9:54:12 PM$Reviewer: nurse15, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$Let me tell you to stay far away from this medication if you have anxiety or adhd.  I tried this medication for only 3 weeks and it has altered my life for the worst.  I cried all the time, extremely depressed, emotionally torn, hateful towards others, hated the world.   My heart started skipping beats, increased my anxiety soaring through the roof.  I have still to this day head/ear fullness, insomnia,  eye floaters, elevated blood pressure, visual disturbances, severe arm and leg weakness, muscle fatigue and on and on.

573$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$3/10/2010 5:20:21 AM$Reviewer: crinzle, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$3$I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and put on Wellbutrin SR because my doctor wanted me to avoid stimulants because I am also diagnosed with Bipolar type I. I took it for about 5 weeks and then stopped (with permission from my doctor) because it slammed me into serious depression, I was super emotional and tired all the time but it did nothing to slow my brain down, or to help me focus and prioritize to make rational decisions. Basically, it did absolutely nothing for my ADHD symptoms and it's funny how my doctor put me on this because she was worried about me going into mania if I was on a stimulant yet being on Wellbutrin did the exact opposite, in fact it was the first time in my life I have ever felt suicidal.

I had side effects that increased my libido or should I say turned on my libido, I was dead that way and didn't know it.  I was horny for almost a month 24/7.

738$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/30/2018 7:57:44 PM$Reviewer: sunnyflower, 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$I've been on this medication for about 2 months. When I first started taking it (75mg), I noticed an increase in acne, but I didn't yet connect it to the medication. I thought it may have simply been due to stress. Then when I increased my dosage to 150mg, my acne got much worse. It was very shocking, as I never really had more than a few pimples before. But now my forehead is covered in bumps and angry, red pimples. This typically isn't included as a side effect, but online I've found that many other people got cystic acne after taking this drug.
742$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/11/2018 1:33:05 PM$Reviewer: dvdblack, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$4$3$I've been on Wellbutrin Xr 300mg 4 months. It has helped with my mood. I feel like I can start getting things done easier. I put somewhat effective because it helps me to focus on things I already know how to do. Keeping focus when learning new things was a challenge. When I take it in the morning I don't feel like going back to bed. I am able to either get things done or relax and watch TV. It doesn't give me the feeling that I HAVE to be doing something. I was able to go to work after taking it. Although I did have anxiety when talking to people at work. Mostly because I felt different. That feeling went away after 5 days. I never felt uncomfortable while being out and about. Just in case I feel I should let you know I started at 150mg for 4 weeks then went to 300mg. That is the normal way to start. Plus when I went up in mg I had no ill effects.

Also I suffer from depression which is sometimes quite severe. It's a horrible one-two punch which almost made my life unbearable. My doctor and I first tried Zoloft which we gradually increased in dosage. It worked to some degree but not completely and I had severe side effects. After consulting with my pharmacist and doctor and the two of them consulting together we worked out a treatment which cut down my Zoloft and added a moderate dosage of Wellbutrin. This has worked perfectly for me with few side effects.

Put on W. Was told it could take up to 2-3 wks. to take effect. ONLT TOOK 3 DAYS!!! It was the absolute BEST drug that I've ever taken for BOTH the depression AND the A.D.D.! I was actually a functioning, NORMAL, NO-MIND-RACING-able to focus,AGAIN-NORMAL human being! HORRIBLY- in my case-this only lasted for a little over 3 months. After that, it slowly began to go back to my old ""normal"" (abnormal)? self. I was heartbroken! My Dr. explained that this sometimes happens and that believe it or not the drug was still working. No-it wasn't. ALL of the old symptoms re-appeared. If they could only find a way to make the effects of this drug last, SO many people with the same problems could be helped. I should add that I also had (still do)chronic fatigue(it's a.d.d.-NOT a.d.h.d.)chronic pain & fibro. Wellbutrin was amazing! I should also add that I took it BEFORE it was used as a smoking cessasion drug and it DID help me to cut WAY back on cigarette consumption!(Who knew)? Anyway-hope this can help someone else.I should ALSO note that this was a little over 10 yrs. ago."

Mostly inattentive. Jittery for about 4 months. It buys me that extra second I need to keep from putting my foot in my mouth. 
  I wanted to try this as I detest the crash of the mainline ADD drugs. DR. also tells me there should be less of the dosage creep of adderal, etc.
  On 300 MG and happy as a clam. It also cured my cold sleeping. Went from 5"" of covers in July (GA) to sheet and single blanket. A very unexpected bonus and worth the price of admission alone.
  It does not do a lot for racing thoughts. It seems to give me the patience to put up with them. It does allow me to stop and remember where I put things. As a result, I can function much better out in my shop. (Less time looking for tools.) As a teacher it helps me handle the paperwork. 
  It won't solve all the ADD issues, but it is buying me time to ge back on track. ADD diagnosed age 8, 53 now. No drugs for last 32 years. Only script I take. Death of wife/ADD Coach knocked me out of sync. I am quite happy with things for now."

It gave me horrible anxiety, palpatations and made me very edgy.  It also prevented my from falling asleep which is obviously a problem within itself.  I knew my pain was not from my job, posture, or poor ergonomics.  Once q went from 300mg to 150mg, most of my upper back pain was abolished.  When I quit cold turkey (you can with tis drug unlike SSRI's), my neck pain was abilished!!!   In the future when I take in a new patient, I will make sure to see if they are on buproprion.  I think this drug should yanked off the market by the FDA!   My wife was prescribed it for bipolar, and she became so full of anxiety that she could'nt even concentrate to prepare a typical meal!

She began to withdraw from her normal behavior, and her school work regressed to about a 2-3rd grade level.  Her memory was affected dramatically.  We removed her from the Wellbutrin treatment after we heard similar stories about the effects.  She began a slow recovery and is functioning at a high level now.  Her ability to know left from right, tell time and several other skills that she had for several years were severely affected and she continues to struggle with some of these issues.

It countered wonderfully the Paxil I was co-currently taking.  I had not until adding Wellbutrin been able to orgasm in less than 35 minutes!  BUT, being a smoker, the appetite increase was due to the fact that I COULD NOT STOMACH a cigarette on Wellbutrin.  Between that negative effect, no real noticeable change with depressive or ADHD symptoms, the ONLY upshot was the sexual drive.  WHATEVER.

Initially I was prescribed this 150mg twice daily by my PCP and noticed a remarkable difference in my ability to focus and concentrate, and it improved my mood.  Unfortunately the dosage was too high to start out with and I had very uncomfortable heart palpitations and was dropped back to 100mg twice daily.  That continued to help my mood and memory a great deal but I didn't have the benefit of the focus and concentration.  Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist and still taking 75mg daily of this plus some Ritalin, which is helping me to concentrate better and not get as distracted.

I was originally prescribed Ritalin but can not take stimulants due to a weird reaction and I developed Tourettes Syndrome.  After years of trial and error with medications I have settled with Strattera 60mg and Wellbutrin XL 150 mg.  They work well together. The Wellbutrin helps with ADHD, depression, and helps balance the irritability I get from strattera, however it does make me more anxious, which is hard to live with.  The Strattera lets me concentrate and my grades are decent in my third year college. 
With any drug there are side affects but after six years the Wellbutrin is still working. It doesn't seem as harsh as other drugs and the weight management is just a bonus.  If I forget to take it my day is not so smooth.
