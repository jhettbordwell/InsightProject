0$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/30/2019 10:57:43 AM$Reviewer: Anonymous, 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$Very powerful for fixing attention problems. It makes it much easier to work, however the side effects are strange and concerning. There is a significant loss of appetite and dry mouth, but these are not terribly strange. While the medicine wears off (which takes hours), paranoia and confusion can set in. While these happen, there is a feeling of freezing despite the actual temperature, possibly due to a lack of food? Either way, very good for what it is meant to do but unfortunate side effects.

I'm hoping it continues to work, hes only complained of slight dizziness and some nausea but other than that he says he feels fine:) I'm only upset I didn't take him to the dr sooner! 
3$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/14/2019 9:03:08 AM$Reviewer: Kmennis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I am an adult with ADHD since childhood. My psychiatrist and I tried several medications including Adderall which gave me mild anxiety. I take Vyvanse during the day and methylphenidate in evenings when I have school work. The methylphenidate helps keep me focused with no side effects. Only issue is that it only lasts a couple hours. Most ADHD medications do not last as long as they are supposed to. Vyvanse is a 12 hr med and I am doing good if I get eight hrs with it. Would prefer to take Vyvanse twice a day, but insurance would never pay for that, so methylphenidate is a great option.

I feel that 54mg would be a much more effective treatment.

The side effects are not too bad. I do notice that I tend to yawn quite a bit when I'm taking it, but oddly, I'm not tired. It also gives me sweaty palms. Otherwise, I feel it is working well.
11$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/7/2016 3:17:41 PM$Reviewer: Leah, 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$3$Every time I took this medicine I had a rapid heart beat, excess sweating, agitation, mood swings, decreased appetite. And occasionally muscle  twitching, body temperature decreased, numbness in my fingers and toes which made it hard for me to write/ type. I always took prescribed amount. The medicine did not help much with my condition but gave me all these side effects inside. Would not recommend.
12$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/17/2016 6:05:48 PM$Reviewer: Tyler Weitzel, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I didn't like the long acting pills, so I don't recommend taking anything other than plain ritalin tablets.  I've heard that you can build up a tolerance to the medication; however, I never felt like that happened to me over the 5 years I took it.  I was prescribed 60 mg a day, which was the best, but usually found that I could take less by breaking the pill in half.  I felt like it was too much sometimes, and it was time to take a pill, so I'd break it in half and save the remainder for another day.  It had always helped me achieve better grades without feeling like i had to try.  I watched other students struggle and I felt like the drug in a way kind of cheated out better grades.  I definitely recommend the plain methylphenidate tablets.  It seemed like the long acting capsules were not manageable.  We can't take less than the prescription and the three hour tablets allow this.

16$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/1/2014 8:41:36 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$"I started taking ADHD meds in 2009. I started with Vyvanse.  I had terrible side-effects: constipation, inability to urinate (I would have an extreme desire to pee like if I didn't immediately go to the bathroom I was going to pee my pants. Then, I would stand there for 20 to 30 seconds before beginning an it would be a squirt, then another 10 sec's with another squirt and when I couldn't go anymore it felt like I hadn't emptied my bladder.) I would get terrible acid-indigestion, my back would hurt, headaches, and the worse of all the side-effects was the numbness in my hands and feet. The numbness at night got to a point that my fingers felt like they were on fire(literally burning).  I actually had to wear wrist bands, like people who have carpel tunnel syndrome, and that would alleviate the burning enuf to go to sleep.
The doctor changed my medication to Adderall and I had identical side-effects; no worse, but no less. He suggested that I continue the medication and eventually the side effects will dissipate.  I took the Adderall for a year and 1/2 and the side effects never lessened.(by the way, I'm not a masochist). I just enjoyed the psychological benefits so much that I continued to soldier-on with the terrible side effects so I could have focus, have conversations, organize my thoughts, have less depression, be calm etc.,etc.
The misery finally won over and I quit taking the medication.  Nearly a year later I was so upset that I couldn't have the good without the bad. I nearly begged my doctor for something else that could help.  This is 2014 and I first started ADHD medication in 2009 with horrible results.  It took me badgering my doctor to get him to give me Ritalin.  His first response was: ""Ritalin is for children"" but he finally gave me a prescription and all I can say is WOW! All the ADHD problems addressed and no side-effects.  It's only been 2 months on Ritalin but when I took the other drugs I experienced the side-effects within 2 days."
17$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/15/2014 1:51:28 AM$Reviewer: ecstaticmom, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$4$4$My son has been taking this for 4 months, starting just after he turned 6. He has done a total 180. He went from almost being expelled in kindergarten to a star student. His handwriting is now legible and he can sit and read me a book with no problem. I went from not wanting to medicate my child to grateful that I did. It didn't make him a zombie and he still has plenty of personality. This drug won't work for everyone, and can have some horrible effects on some people. All ADHD drugs are trial and error. He does metabolize it faster than he should so we only get about 10 hours out of a 12 hour dose but on the plus side of that, he sleeps fine. He did stop asking to eat throughout the day, and lost weight as a result but his Dr talked to HIM about eating and eating high protein foods so he wouldn't lose anymore. A month later, he had gained all but 2 oz of it back. We still have to remind him to eat but he will if he's asked to. I've known since he was 2 that he had ADHD and I'm glad that I finally decided to address medicating him. He's now the delightful little boy I knew was always in him somewhere. My family and friends have noticed the huge change and now ask him to have sleepovers and playdates, which almost never happened before Concerta. He'll start going to Boys & Girls Club in the fall after school and he's super excited, which would have never been possible without this medication.

Virtually eliminated insomnia, impacted cholesterol numbers and stabilizd my blood pressure at great levels. After a lifetime of adhd coping mechanisms in place along with this relatively mild drug has worked wonders for me. In the years since restarting this drug as an adult I have made incredible professional and personal progress. I think too much unrealistic expectations are placed on this drug but it is not a magic pill. It works great for me used in conjunction with coping habits I have developed throughout my life. 
25$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/8/2014 8:11:35 PM$Reviewer: Jonothon, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$"I have taken this drug before and for me it did not work very well, i do not have ADHD that bad and honestly people don't know unless I tell them my biggest problem is I am easily distracted. When i took this drug the first month everything was going good my penmanship improved greatly along with vocabulary but about 2 months in I was very irritable and I just feld so much anger and hatred towards everyone. By the 3rd    month my mother had me seeing a psychologist because I beat my brother up pretty badly and was extremely aggressive, we later found out it was not me it was the medication. This drug can work but talk to your doctor if you notice some of the side affects listed on this site and I wouldn't pay attention to the ""Sever"", ""Less Severe"" part because it may affect you differently than it has others in the past."

My conversations I would keep repeating myself. My friends are amazed at the difference it has made since I started taking it. The Psych wanted me on the 40er but I dint like them at all. I take 10mg in am and 10mg at noon. Perfect dose for me. I think sometimes doctors want to give you a stronger dosage then you need. Kids on the 40mg seems to me like an awful lot. My BP is lower my pulse has slowed down, I can sleep better at night. It works great for me.

I started on 54mg and it wasn't enough so then I moved up to 72mg. That was way too much for me and I started freaking out. My heart was racing, I was running around in circles trying to get my energy out and it just hurt really bad. So then I took 63mg, and I have been fine on it, although I feel that it could help me focus more. But the worst thing about it is it makes me depressed. I was already sorta depressed before but when I take this, it makes it so much worse.

It was too much for me and I felt a come down when it wore off 3-5 hours later. Told my doctor about it and he perscribed 5mg. I was able to focus on tasks much better on either dose but I don't feel a come down from the 5mg pill. However, after taking this med once or twice a day for 3 or 4 days I had become easily agitated and somewhat agressive and I'm a pretty mellow guy. I only take it now if I have a task that requires my attention for long periods of time because I do have a problem staying focused but I'm not hyperactive and never have been.
57$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/29/2012 10:15:34 AM$Reviewer: Relieved mom, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $3$5$3$My son is 8 years old in the 2nd grade. The last 3 years I have gotten feedback from the teachers indicating minor behavioral problems with him such as, he has a hard time focusing, he cant sit still, he speaks very loud, and now in 2nd grade, his comprehension in reading was starting to reflect a problem. I never realized this at home because at home he read and comprehended his books just fine, however, these were books of his preference. I took him to the doctor who recommended this medication. Although it has only been a week, I have notice a change with focus and patience. I watched my son who never sat still, draw detailed pictures for an hour(He has never sat more than 10 min on anything other than video games). As far as school goes, he has been paying more attention in class and finishing his homework independently. My only complaint is that when this medication wears off, it really wears off and it seems like all of the controlled hyper was bottled throughout the day, then released at once but only lasts for a little while and doesn't interfere with bedtime. Overall this medication has helped and I now see a side of my child that I have never seen before and I am really pleased.

I started taking it in 5th grade and I'm now in my first year of college. Concerta has helped me to actually do homework instead of getting bored 5 minutes into homework and class. I have become an actual student and avid learner thanks to concerta. I think the new generic has made me break out because I used to have great skin but I can fix that. I would get used to the medication or I would realize it was too low of a dosage so my dosage is up to 54. Although through out the years the one bad side effect is that I would have upset stomach or weight loss but I was fine with that but the extreme side effect that I still fight when I don't take my medication is my overwhelming and complete ravenous hunger I get. I will literally eat everything in sight. So I feel a necessity to take my concerta everyday. But besides that I would recommend this to anyone wanting an ADHD medication.

What I can say is it has had several pro's along with some con's. Here is a list of Pro's and Con's of Generic Ritalin IR that I've experienced. 

Pros:
- Better Concentration (my ability to focus has moved to having 25% focus to 60% focus)
- Helps me be more awake and focused in class at school. 
- Grades have slightly improved in school.
- Doesn't last too long so I can take it around 6pm and still be in bed no later than 1am. 
- It's Cheap

Cons: 
- I sometimes crash and get really tired when the effects wear off.
- I sometimes have an empty feeling while on it, it's similar to depression but not a bad (it still sucks though)
- Hard to take since it doesn't last long, sometimes it lasts 2 hours other times 4-6. 
- I feel bored on it when doing things I normally enjoy.

Apparently concerta is no longer covered due to this cheaper pill. My 10 year old has been making strides since going from adderall (too much weight loss) straterra (ineffective) to concerta (working the best so far). Now with this new generic, he has a daily scowl on his face, simple arguments turn to serious tantrums and none of these things were present when on concerta. If this is just a generic version then why such serious side effects that the other didn't have. School is starting soon and playing with medications for my son is completely unacceptable. I will be meeting with my doctor to correct this week, but the fact that insurance can just change on a dime is pretty ridiculous.

84$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/17/2010 2:32:56 PM$Reviewer: Laura,  Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I started methylphenidate (MPH) immediate-release 7 years ago. Over the years I have switched medications back and forth until Methylin ER came out. It is an extended dose of methylphenidate and lasts 8 hrs. When taking this medicine, it does not affect my sleep even when the medicine is still active (in my system). The only downside is the overall effectiveness. It does not keep me as alert as MPH immediate release but there are alot of upsides. I am not moody or cranky on this medicine and I only have to take it twice a day instead of 4 times

I have increased the dosage a bit over the years, but as my life got more complicated the medicine became more of an issue. I am a serious athlete and have struggle with balancing this medicine, training, school, and my health. I find that there are several very serious problems  with this medicine.  Concerta dramatically decreases appetite to the point were i had to force-feed myself because my body was hypoglycemic and i felt faint after hard workouts. While the medz realyl helped at school, it is not long enough lasting so that i can effectively do homework at 9pm, but if i was to take a larger dose, i would never sleep.  some other side effects that have really hurt me are abdominal cramping, dramatically increased sweating and intense nausea, all of which are serious issues when you are a cyclist and training/racing in 90*F.  This medicine is fine if you arent an athlete, but if you are, you will find that its is helpful only if you can master/ work around its (potentially) serious side effects.  For me, this has been a deciding factor in my life, even though as of now im still a teenager. i hope that this review has been helpful, and that more reviews like this may motivate the company Concerta to develop a more athlete friendly medication

I ended up going to the ER thinking I was having a stroke.  The doctors said that was not a side effect of Ritalin, however, I see on WebMD that it is.  I was totally freaked out, I stopped it immediately and was terrified to try anything else. I also got very moody, I would space out on the way to work and get angry for no reason. Other than that, it worked well, I was focusing on housework and arriving to work on time. I just didn't like those side effects.
90$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/4/2010 5:56:49 PM$Reviewer: Jetski22, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$As soon as I went to college, I knew that there was something wrong. I couldn't sit still in class, I was always looking around, I was impatient, and I was SO bored; furthermore, three hour classes aren't easy to sit through. I was taking therapy, and my therapist told me that I had ADHD. THAT was a surprise. (Not really.) I had known for years prior. So, I went to my PCP, (Primary Care Physician) and told her what was up. I told her that the night before it had taken me three hours to only read a few pages out of my book, and that I needed to do SOMETHING. So, she prescribed me with Ritalin. The WONDER drug. It takes about 30 minutes to set in, and lasts about 4 hours. I could read and understand what I was reading, and also, I could sit STILL! Yes, COMPLETELY still! I love it so much, because if you only have to sit still for a couple of hours, just take half the dosage! It is amazing, non-addictive, and helps you to keep focused. I love it, and if you think you have ADHD, or ADD, ask your PCP about Ritalin. =)

Toward the last 6 motnhs that we had him on it, he became a very angry and violent young man.

The benefits that we saw with this medication were never fantastic, but seemed to get him through the day. "
120$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/5/2009 3:05:13 AM$Reviewer: Grateful, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking methylphenidate for 3 months now. I presently take the immediate acting pills at 180 mg/day,i.e.,40mg tid. I took Concerta 36mg/day for 3 years and it stopped working well so I was changed to Adderall, then to Dextroamphetamine. The Dextroamphetamine worked well, but it made my skin break out badly. If we can get the dose of Methylphenidate optimized I will stay with it. I am studying for the GRE so that I can go to graduate school. The medicine helps me to stay on task and keeps my mind from wandering. My ADHD manifests mostly as the inattentive type with comorbid depression, anxiety disorder and slight shizoaffective disorder. It has taken many years, various doctors, and many trials of different medications to get the correct mix and dosages. Thank God I am stable enough to go back to school and almost get the education that I had originally attempted. I  attended 3 years of medical school before I had to withdraw due to symptoms of my then undiagnosed ADHD. I am now 54 years old and until fairly recently have missed a diagnosis of ADHD all these years. It is only extremely evident that I have ADHD when I take the medications for it. I go from a good student to my normal excellent student status. The attendant symptoms of ADHD have crippled my chances for the lifestyle I had planned, but I can't gripe much because the pain they caused me drove me into the loving arms of my dear Lord and Savior and I am now one of His ordained and grateful ministers, a path I would not have taken without the pain from ADHD.

I was very torn about the decision to medicate my child.  I decided to try it to see if I saw any improvement.  The improvement was apparent immediately.  We have had to change his dosage (15mg 2x's daily), however now I am not the only one who sees how sweet and caring and wonderful my son is.  Before medicine, most people were aggravated with him and did not understand.  Now, he is very successful socially.  He never had a problem learning - the ultimate multi-tasker - but most children did not enjoy his company.  But now,he is invited to all the birthday parties and even has been star student!  This otherwise would not have been possible without this medicine.  The only issue, but is relatively insignificant, is the pills are in 10 mg and he has to take 15.  I have to be very careful in seperating the medicine and splitting pills.  But this is hardly a problem considering the success it has given my son.

Started with 5mg back in 6th grade and has slowly increases dosage over the years.  She just recently went to 30 mg.  She gets good grades in school and is able to focus, but she notices that she is quieter in school while on it. The days she forgets to take it the ""real"" her comes out and she is talkative and fun to be around. She does, however, get ""C"" grades on those days.  Since switching to 30mg she has been moodier, more irritable, and she cries more easily.  These are heightened on the weekends when she usually sleeps too late to take it.  Her boyfriend says she has less emotion and doesn't have an interest in things.  She also has a lot of headaches.  I think    we may have to switch her medication.  It's unfortunate that in order to focus and do well in school she has to take something that keeps her true personality from showing.  Have others experienced any of these symptoms? I do have to say that children as young as 5/6 shouldn't be on this medication unless they are completely out of control in school.  And they should never need medication at that age just to get through homework. and it shouldn't be needed in order for them to do homework. Homework at that age isn't necessary. "

Although I give it great reviews, its more for what its not prescribed for than what it is.  I got A's and B's in Calculus 1,2,3, Physics 1,2, and Chemistry 1,2 sequence plus Diff EQ.  But, this drug will make you want to have sex all day and it is a distraction. Its almost painful how the mind will not deviate from this topic.  Also, when the drug wears off many people feel ""nervous"" but in my opinion this is when you can get the most work done because whatever you focus on will be worked on, you just have to ignore the depression or jitters.  Do not take this drug everyday!  I took 30mg capsule about once a week and the mind really doesn't stop racing for about a week.  You can sleep about 24 hours after taking a 30mg capsule, but the mind seems to remember how to function correctly well after that.
One final note is that when the drug does wear off, waking up is very very difficult, but sleeping is very enjoyable."

I am careful of not taking it 3 hours before bed because it does take me about 5 minutes longer to fall asleep.

It alters your personality as well as helping you focus and stay on track with your activities. It does not substitute for a good work ethic or diligence however, those skills must be trained not drugged.

This medicine does give an extreme drop off after approximately 6 hours after the dosage and is rather rough on one mentally.

Almost as if you were watching one channel of tv and suddenly someone else grabs the remote and switches channels without your control. 

I felt I needed to post because I read of so many VERY young children being given this powerful drug and I believe that discipline must first be attempted before jumping into giving your 5 year old drugs."

She started on Ritalin LA as her first medication attempt a few months later when school started.  She did good on it for a while.  We got up to 30mg daily but instead of the 6-8hrs promised, she usually got a good 5 usable hours prior to coming down.  She was arguementative about homework at night unless it was done right after school (which we started doing w/my mom).  She developed a very loud, annoying and very  disruptive verbal tic.  (Think throat clearing loud enough to hurt your ears within 3 feet of her).  So we are switching to Strattera to try it and we'll see.  The Ritalin was pretty good though, she complained of stomach pain sometimes and I think that was the medicine.  But overall, no weight loss (just smaller gains than prior on the growth chart but it remained consistant) normal growth rate, appetite was less so for lunch but good the rest of the day.  She did SO much better in school and her ability to concentrate when it was working was great.  An overall good improvement, but the tic thing was an overwhelming side effect that was detrimental to school and social situations.  I think the tic was brought out from stress, but, am not sure.  I'm hoping she will do good on the Strattera, but it bothers me there is no other way to treat this that doesn't involve potentially mood altering drugs.....

We have increased to 27mg per day (due to growth). We definitely notice a difference if she hasnt taken them for a day (lack of impulse control, fidgety, high energy). The tablets are small enough for her to swallow with minimal effort, which is a plus! She has had a significant growth spurt as she nears puberty, so difficult to tell if weight gain is due to the meds (I think mostly not). She does complain of headaches occasionally. Overall, we have been satisfied with this medication.

However, the one benefit I see to this med over the others is that his appetite has increased.  On the other meds, he barely ate and he was under-weight for his age.

In the first 5 weeks of the school year he was failing 3 classes. As soon as he started taking just 10mg of Methylin ER he could focus and made the honor roll. The effects last the entire school day. He struggles a bit to concentrate on homework, but so far it's  manageable. He has put on 10 pound in 6 weeks though. He isn't hungry all day, but pigs out in the evenings.

I didn't think I would ever medicate my child in this way but I'm glad that I have because he is more focused and less aggressive (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS MEDICATION).  In the short time since his diagnoses, we have tried about 4 different medications and this particular drug has been the least effective. He acts as if he's not currently taking any medication.  In the 1 month that he's been on this drug he has shown severe aggression towards his 2 yr old brother and has been very whiny.  The medication that has been the most effective is Metadate CD.  He was doing great in school and wonderful with his little brother.  Starting tomorrow morning we're going to try Conterta but if this fails we'll go back to Metadate CD in a heartbeat.

His origial doseage was 5mg twice a day once at 4PM and again at 7PM however last year I spoke with our family DR and informed him that it seemed as though at times it made it to where he could not go to sleep he would lay there in bed and stare at the ceiling or mess around for 3-4 hours after going to bed so we decided to cut out the 7PM dosage. However, he still has this problemm at times. I have also noticed that there are times that this medicine seems to help and then other times he still bounces off the wall so I have had mixed feelings about it. I am thinking it is time to re-evaluate him and maybe try something differant.

After taking this medication for a month now, it has been very good for me so far. The first week being on this med I was skeptical, and it didn't seem to be working very well, but I decided to go a couple more weeks, to see what happens. 

It seems like once I got to my 3rd week the Ritalin started working better, I know people say it is a stimulant, so it should work immediantley, but I think people don't understand that although it works the first time it may not work right till your body gets used to it. 


Here are my pros and cons of it so far:

Pros: 
-Better Focus, yeah I still get distracted from time to time, but It's WAY easier to focus and concentrate.
-My Vision looks sharper, almost like how a T.V. is when you turn up the contrast. 
-Better a video games... Hey I'm a college student this stuff is important too lol.
-Slightly more sociable, a little less shy
-I feel more like a ""Normal"" person

Cons: 
-Slightly increased heart rate 72bpm to 80-90bpm
-I get irrated easier
-Occasional mild depression when it is wearing off
-Desire to take more, it's scary (I DO NOT do this though)
-Decreased Appetite



If you're on this med, don't be too quick to judge, give it a month and see if it starts working better."

I started getting very aggravated and had severe headaches when it wore off. It definitely helped me focus and deal with the scattered thoughts of add/adhd but the side effects became not worth it. When my friends started asking why I was so cranky all the time I started to worry and took myself off it. I had a very add week but no headaches or irritability issues. I am now on vyvanse and so far it seems to be treating my symptoms with no major side effects. It calms me down, and I don't feel irritable, also I do not have headaches when it wears off. The only thing is, after reading many reviews, it seems very bad for small children. Also, the first day I took it I forgot to eat. So I now eat three meals a day, hungry or not.

I take 20 mg daily. And definitely notice changes in my mood and concentration. Only thing is. I was on concerta for a while till I tired to overdose on it that's why I switched to Ritalin because Concerta made me sick after I tried to OD. One big difference is the side effects. I experience lots of side effects with this medication and my boyfriend notices it too and absolutely hates that I take this medication because it completely alters me. I can't sleep when I am on this medication because I shake to much and am way to focused on things like now as I am writing the review I know I am only writing it because I have nothing to focus on right now. Another issue is how addictive this is. I had to give my boyfriend the pills because I took them for a week and became addicted. Addiction runs in my family and never in a million years did I think I'd get addicted to Ritalin but I did and I had to stop taking it which means I was more moody and just awful to be around but getting off it was fairly easy for me just not anyone around me. But Ritalin works a lot better than concerta did but the side effects I feel aren't worth it. My anxiety gets worse. I can't eat when I'm on it or I feel physically sick. I can't sleep while on it because my brain I still working to quick. I can type like crazy though obviously. I stutter when I'm on it. And overall I think it's great for school work or exams but I can't do normal everyday things while on it because my brain works faster than I do and it only concentrates on one thing. It also affects my vision and I am not able to drive while I am on it.

For exams I would cram just before them. Although I passed exams the lack of revision led to average grades. Later I got easily bored in relationships and when I managed to stay in one and get married that ended in divorce due to basically being inattentive. As an Engineer I was successful, renowned for troubleshooting and inventing. (incl Patents) however always frustrated with inability to focus, do paperwork. Advent of the internet was great to suck up data while hopping from site to site but distraction from task at hand. I was somewhat aware of ADHD but thought it was an issue in kids and I was not hyperactive. 
While spending some time working in the USA and expressing my frustration with someone reporting to me at their lack of detailed reports and late reports (a problem I suffered myself) they commented that they had ADD and so had I. I was 40.They pointed me at some books re Adult ADD and wow what a revelation. It could identify all my strengths and weaknesses. In returning to Europe I suddenly realised how different the awareness was to ADD especially in adults. However I managed to get the diagnosis from a child behaviorist specialist and understanding from my doctor and Ritalin was prescribed. 20mg, 3 times a day. Impact was enormous but over time the effect was wearing off. Also some people complained I could be a pain in my opinionated and forceful view. An unforeseen downside was my pension provider wanted to review the life assurance aspect of my policy as people with ADD were more likely to have risky behavior and be addicted to for example alcohol. (it helps turn down that over active mind at night) 
I decided to take Ritalin not daily but as required to complete a task, like a tax return or expenses. I would use it a couple of times a week. To-do lists and reminders on phones helped. My tolerance to Ritalin reduced again. Relationships and work flourished. Ritalin is a great help. "

It hasn't been as effective as other ADHD medications I've taken in the past, however the side effects are so refreshingly mild in comparison that I cannot imagine myself ever taking anything else again. 
The only side effects I have noticed so far have been decreased appetite (which I'm fine with, as exam season and bikini season are one after the other), and some slight behavioural differences. By this I mean that after my Ritalin has worn off, I feel significantly stronger ADHD symptoms than I would normally. However, this hyperactive phase generally subsides within a day or so. "
330$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/7/2014 7:51:50 PM$Reviewer: anon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$ I was a Focalin xr user, but after switching to ppo it became too expensive and I switched to Ritalin. (Focalin is an isotope of Ritalin) At first I didn't like Ritalin. It seemed too hard, and I would crash after the medicine left my body. Long story short, I cut the dosage and the side effects vanished. It does what it is supposed to do. It allows me to think clearly and focus without making me feel like a zombie, or overly excited. I still prefer Focalin xr, but Ritialin is a fine substitute.

He is in year one and since he started taking this medicine, he is doing great at school. he has started getting better grade at school and teachers are happy too. i do not like to take and give drugs but i think it has been working for my 6 yr old for last one yr now. i hope it continues to work like this. no major side effects apart from loosing a bit weight but i think that is okay if it helps him overall. i honestly want him to stop using this may be in few years time but time will tell..the only reason i am writing this to let everyone know that it may help your child. i wish you all good luck and please write more reviews which can help other people...thank you.

At the time I didn't realize how important it was and how badly I needed to be medicated. In college it helped me  tremendously with studying, reading, testing and paying attention. At works it totally keeps me focused and gives me energy. I can follow conversations like ""normal"" people, pay attention and follow to movies and tv.
It does reduce appetite but I make an effort to eat before I take it. And obviously it affects sleep. I try not to take my meds too late, also, my Dr also has me on trazadone (sleepy pill)
There is always a possibility of addiction but your Dr should be monitoring you. (I've had countless people try to buy my Rx...even steal.

Lastly, let's say you run out of your meds and you can't get them filed for a few days... in my experience I have had horrible withdrawal. I couldn't stop sleeping but when I was awake all I wanted to do was eat. I became listless and fricken exhausted for a few days.
The good outweighs the bad with this drug. It's definitely abused by the wrong people."

I was taking zolof after my pregnancy thinking I needed it, but I still had had issues with depression and not being able to focus or remember anything, etc.   I have neuropathy also, and where my tips are numb and tingly otherwise, with ritalin, I can feel them now. I focus much better, finish my tasks nicely, am in a positive mood, and feel 'normal'.. lol.     Seriously though, I'm prescribed 3x a day, but I only use it 2x and none after about 2pm, that way it kills off in time for bedtime.  No problems yet.

I took the Ritalin once and knew it wouldn't work. I also have depression, and I had been feeling rather low around the time I started Ritalin. The very first day I took the Ritalin, I knew the moment it wore off. Suddenly, I had no desire to live anymore. I wasn't suicidal; I simply had no energy. None. Not a bit. My lethargy was complete. I found myself standing in the middle of a field, staring, not feeling that I even had the energy to wonder how I had gotten there. Honestly, I would rather be unable to focus than feel that terrible every single time my meds wear off.

My sleep ""tumbled"" around the clock like a tennis shoe in a dryer, only somewhat related to day/night.  It took about 7 years for the effect to lessen enough where I could manage it, but still 14 years later it requires effort can be annoying to manage.  Prior to taking the drug, I did struggle a little bit to get to sleep and to wake up, it had no real impact and no one ever expressed concern that it wasn't normal.  After taking the drug; however, I saw year after year go by, unable to work, unable to function in a normal way and take care of myself, and so frequently asleep during the day that I was unable to sustaining an effort to even get help."

Ritalin IR was the first ADHD stimulant med that I tried and WOW.. I was totally amazed at how much it improved my 'get up and go' and ability to sustain focus on boring tasks. I titrated up to 20mg x 4 per day from my original 10mg x 3 and even though over time the med decreased in effectiveness it was still highly effective. The trick is to understand that when tolerance kicks in the is still working you just need to work with it rather than let the med do all the work like at the start. Better than Dexedrine IR for lock-on focus but inferior when it comes to improving organisation. Overall though its a highly effective, life-changing med.

Adderall restricted my diet, caused minor depression, and even sleeping problems, unlike my concerta and methylphenidate (Ritalin based drugs). To be honest I think its safe to say that Ritalin is a powerful stimulant with a few addictive qualities for teens of my age. Sorry I cant recommend any speciffic ADD/ADHD medication that doesn't have any downsides. Out of those 3 above prescriptions listed, I believe ritalin is the most effective

Of the 50 or so comments I read about this drug, 90 percent of Ritalin's users say that after 6-9 months after starting this drug, it was ineffective and caused major side effects, I'm no doctor but  if I were, I would only prescribe this drug for short periods, like 6-12 months.

Do not listen to anyone who attempts to justify that Ritalin is safe, it is not. I, alongside some close friends and family, have been prescribed for several years and it is very clear the changes in our personality. The creativity and humour we once had has been replaced by depressing thoughts, mood swings and above all a very strong dependency on a drug that now dictates our lives. In contradiction to my doctor's words, Ritalin is not safe nor necessary and believe me once you begin to take it, you will find yourself lost without it.

The lack of appetite sucks because I already forget to eat sometimes when I'm either really focused or really unfocused, so not ever being hungry means I don't have a natural reminder to eat.

Years ago went to doc with chest pains and after ruling out physical aliment, he referred me to a physiologist. Head doc diagnose me with add and gave me strattera. didn't know much about it but it turned my life around. Had problems peeing, hurt ejaculate, and after taking cold meds one winter I had serous high blood pressure. Body doc told me to stop, and the head doc started me down the road of lexapro and other meds that made me not give a damn.  Got off those after my house went to crap...and wasted 8 years of my life.  Recently started screwing up at work, and relizing I couldn't get anything done outside of work, went back to my 3rd head doc and ask for generic add med. He tried to put me on prozac, saying it was the same as ritalin, adderall, but I wasn't buying it.  He put me on 30 mg ritalin and what a help! First day I notice I was slowing down, not making the mistakes I once made, taking care of my home and myself on only 2 5 mg dose. I like that you can cut the instant release pills in half, I have for months settled on taking 10 in the morning and 2 half throughout the day.  That is all I need, no side effects, I like that I can take only what I need unlike stattera and adderall which you are stuck with the dose and side effects.  No dry mouth, dribble peeing, or obsessive thoughts as with stattera.  Course maybe I was on too high a dose with stattera, who knows?  Just hate that I have to see the doc every month, wish he could do refills so i could cut back on visits, wait times are an hour or more.  There is a stigma and fear attached to these drugs because some abuse them, too sad.

Ritalin however helped with focusing, but I felt trapped in my own head, I couldn't express how I was feeling when I was on it.

I have gained 30 lbs on this medication. I take it twice a day once in the am and again after lunch. by 7 pm each day I am tired and groggy and starved I eat everything in site. Generally after I eat all I want to do is sleep.I crash and sleep so hard it is if I have been drugged. If I awake to go to the bathroom I generally feel hungry and often have to fight the urge to go to the kitchen for a snack. I've never been a candy or junk food eater but find myself craving chocolate and chips. Will wake up and eat junk food and go right back to sleep. I dont like this drug. Was previously on Vyvanse 60mg once a day but was getting muscle spasams. that drug worked great but the spasams were awful.Dont know if it came in a lower dosage my doctor just took me off it a smaller dosage may have prevented the spasams. My doctor has now prescribed focalin RX which is very expensive even with my insurance

According to my parents, I had hallucinations, would wake up screaming in the night, as well as break out in twitches. They took me off it after one month of use, and I was put on another medication. I believe it was Concerta. I was on Concerta for the next 15 years of my life.
I still suffer from uncontrollable hand shaking as a side effect of using the Ritalin at such a young age. This is NOT a safe drug for children to be on. It should be taken off the market for children under the age of 16."

I started on concerta ER, which was perfect, no side effects, no notice at all in change of behaviour. lost my insurance and could no longer afford it. its 135 without insurance! so i had to switch to generic ritalin, I take just 10-20mgs,the smallest dose avail. If i have a busy day or meetings, ill take the 20, but usually just a 10mg dose is good. I dont feel or notice anything at all, but I do know it works because im able to focus, work, and i don't forget things or my mind doesn't wander. Scary moments like forgetting my 8 mnth old son on by bed and he rolls off it on to the floor. NOT GOOD! LUCKILY bed is close to the floor and we have thick carpet and he just kind of slid off it, but still reminded me that I have to be more alert and if im watching him myself i take larger dose. It does wonders. Sometimes Ill have these weird panic attacks in middle of the night. I wake up alarmed, with a sense of doom or that im dying or choking, but then i realize in 5 seconds or so that im just having an episode or dream and that I'm fine. I get a drink of water and go back to bed. see your doctor to try different doses or even different meds, but it takes few weeks to settle in and get used to. you can't make decisions based on just a week of use or a few days. hope this helps.

I was then also diagnosed with ADD. I am in the beginning of trying to control this for myself though I have been researching and controlling it for my son for over 5 years. My son takes concerta and it seems to be working for now but I have earned that sometimes you have to switch up meds to keep them effective. I would also suggest anyone needing this kind of treatment see an actual Psychiatrist he has been a life saver for me ... Anyway Ritilin is working for me so far.. I do experience the tight jaw... mild headaches and nausia.  I found if I eat something about 30 minutes after taking it no headache or nausia.. I do tend to not sleep well if I take my last dose too late. But I can concentrate so much better and I get so much more accomplished. At first it did cause me to be irratable but I think that was more me being able to focus on everything going on around me instead of feeling like there was a movie playing in the background. I go back for a check up soon and it will be 3 weeks of taking this med. but so far so good.. Its not perfect or a miracle but it is helping.

Sounds like a miracle drug, right? No! I got so completely addicted to it it drove me crazy. When my doctor took me off of it I would regularly go down to Mexico where I could buy it without a prescription and smuggle it back across the border, I did this for almost 2 years. Luckily, I moved much further north so driving to Mexico was no longer an option, so I'm finally off of it for good. I probably should have gone to some kind of Ritalin rehab. Ritalin also made me want to smoke cigarettes all the time, which is totally disgusting. But now without Ritalin, I no longer want to smoke, it makes me sick just to smell it.

Unless whatever im thinking about is visible or if im talking about it, i can't think ahead to plan anything. i cant think things over in my head. i HAVE to verbalize it or be actually doing it. i dont like that aspect. i almost feel like my thoughts are in a rubber band and as i try to think about something outside of what's visible or what the conversation around me is, it gets snapped back and im forced to think about the present. i know thats part of the reason for taking the medication, but i cant sit in my own thoughts, at all. any suggestions or help?

They just upped the dose to 20mg 3x and 60mg Strattera. It was like turning a light switch off in my head. This medication has changed my life in the best way possible. My wife was the one telling me to get tested for ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADD without Hyperactivity @ age 30. It was very hard to find a MD doctor that believed in giving Ritalin to someone over the age of 18. I finally found a psychiatrist that would. Before I started my meds I had very hard times with home(not able to complete choirs), school (Very poor grades & placed in special class), work (avg job lasting 2-3 months),  projects (I would start them and never finish them), and couldn't keep any long term relationships my whole life. My parents refused that I have had any issues with ADD or ADHD my whole life. They thought I was just the way my brain developed and I was ""Lazy, Procrastinator, Unreliable, Absentminded, Never finish anything I started"" I think they may have been embarrassed of the term ""ADD & ADHD"" in the 1970's. My family, friends, and I cannot believe the changes that the medication has done. It has changed me 180.  I have some books that I also found that has helped me deal with and understand ADD. One book is called ""A.D.D. & Romance"" by Jonathan Halverstadt, ""You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!"" by Kate Kelly & Peggy Ramundo. "

I started on the standard 5mg twice a day.  After about 3 days I could notice a big difference in my ablility to focus and concentrate.  After a week I moved up to 10mg twice a day and then 10 mg three times daily.  I experienced some of the side effects; dry mouth, not hungry, sleeplessness, racing pulse and higher blood pressure, tiredness.  Sleeplessness AND tiredness, well after taking the first dose you hit your peak after about 1-2 hrs and then come back down(crash) which tires you out, take the next dose and go back on that rollercoaster.  I finally figured out how to space my doses out so it would be worn off by the time I needed to get to sleep and for me that was taking the last dose by 3pm so I could hit the sheets by 10pm.  I hated that roller coaster ride so I talked with my doc and he put me on 20mg extended release that I take twice daily.  The effect lasts between 4-8 hrs.  I get up at 5am for work and then go to night school and am home by 930.  Long hours to be needing focused and the extended release is the perfect fit for me.  If the effect is wearing off too fast ask about the extended release and you will be a lot happier.  I do get a slight headach but goes away after eating.

Both seem to be equally effective, but I have different/bad side effects with each. With the Adderall I lost my appetite and lost 7+ pounds in a month. With the Ritalin, I keep getting headaches. I usually never get headaches so I am very disappointed. Hopefully they go away in the next couple of weeks and my body adjusts to the drug, otherwise I will switch back to Adderall or try something else.

So far, I am somewhat pleased with the results.  I don't really have any complaints about it.  So far, my side effects are very mild and don't really interfere with my everyday life.  I started on 5 mg the first week and have moved up to 10 mg, taken twice a day.  I have noticed that my brain does not go a mile a minute any more which makes it easier to concentrate.  I have noticed that I remember things that I would normally forget.  My mood has been so much more calm and my angry outbursts have practically gone completely away.  I do find that I am a little more tired but my increase in mood helps me to overcome that.  No trouble going to sleep but staying asleep is the problem.  I find I am a little more jittery than usual, again not a big deal.  I still forget things on a daily basis, but not near as much as before.  My husband has even noticed a change in my mood, for the better.  I find that it is easier for me to stay on task at work and to prioritize my work more effectively.  I still find myself being distracted a little, but not as much as before the medication.  So, far I have been satisfied with the medication and would recommend it to women my age who have just been diagnosed with Adult ADD, as in my case.

Then I had to keep upping my doses. And then it started working for shorter periods of time. And then it got to a point where I had to take too much too often that it started causing severe ups and downs in energy. I then got on Strattera which works but I had all of the physical side effects and it wasn't worth it anymore. Now I'm starting on Concerta (I'm 27 yrs old now). I think people have to try different things to see what works for them. Also, sometimes you just have to switch after awhile because your body gets used to the medicine. So maybe I'll take Concerta for awhile and then if it stops helping, I'll go back on Strattera.

As part of our ongoing search to discover the medication and dosage that is best for me, my doctor recently prescribed Ritalin.  Unfortunately, the side effects of the medication were such that, after only a week, he took me off the Ritalin and put me back on the medication I was taking previously (Dexedrine).  (Note: Anyone reading this review should remember that what medications and dosages work for ADHD can vary greatly from person to person)  For me, the Ritalin made me feel like I was so exhausted I couldn't think straight.  It also made me both depressed and anxious.  In fact, I am also taking Lexapro to treat depression and when I was taking the Ritalin, the Lexapro stopped working.  Far from providing any sort of help for my ADHD, the Ritalin erased all energy or desire I had to do anything except sleep or cry.  I am very glad to no longer be taking this medication!!!

Dr said to wait at least 2 weeks to see improvment at school, but after 3 days we got a letter from the teacher saying he was listening to instructions better and staying in his seat at lunch, whereas before he was running aroud the lunchroom. He says he doesn't eat lunch at school anymore because he isn't hungry, but he usually eats breakfast before it kicks in and supper when it starts to wear off.  So it does have some effect on his appetite, but we just give him snacks and things whenever he IS hungry so that hasn't been to much of a problem. We tried Vyvanse before and that was a NIGHTMARE!!  We are very happy with this medicine. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it is short acting.

My parents put me on ritalin when I was 6 years old, and I took it for years. I have also been on Adderall and Concerta, for the most part, the drugs all worked the same for me. The upside to ritalin is that it is MUCH cheaper. The downside is having to take it more than once in a day. And in general, the side effects are true. Which can be the downside to these type of drugs. For instance, I know to make sure and have it filled on time because if I don't take it, I literally cannot function because I am so tired. And the crash and the end of the day sucks too. I'm now 20, and can safely say that for me, all the drugs pretty well have worked the same, and for the most part have been effective if taken properly.

This drug is a god send, however, I know I might have the genes that make me prone to addiction. With that in mind, I take this drug sparingly, when I know I will need it, and it has worked like a charm.  I do not take it everyday, and always take a 3 month holiday during the summer.  The trick is to take it at the very beginning of your day, and scheduale your day around when the drug will be most effective, so that you can use it and still sleep at night.  I just wonder about having caffeine with ritalin.

580$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$6/23/2008 1:32:04 PM$Reviewer: Georgia Girl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$4$I was just reading through some of these comments about Ritalin, and I wanted to add my experiences.  I was diagnosed with ADD my senior year of college (over 10 years ago) and had been taken Ritalin ever since.  I agree with all the comments about experiencing the jitters and how you can operate with little sleep.  Despite the side effects, it was a miracle!  I had always taken the max dosage 20 mg/x3.  Over the years I started to see a decrease in effectiveness and even tried other drugs - strattera, adderall, wellbuterin...nothing as effective as ritalin.  Even now I feel somewhat addicted and have even exceeded the max dosage signifcantly.  (For those others who had concerns - ritalin is addictive, esp mentally in my case.)  Needless to say, I've gotten off of it completely for approximately 2 months.  I've been struggling like all of us with true ADD, but I had to prove that I could function without it.  For those of you in the same boat as me, take a break from it.  Once you get back on the ritalin after a break it becomes more effective again. (Just make sure you regulate yourself...I have to divide up my doses by week, and hide the rest.  If I run out then I have to make do without!)  Hopefully this helps!

583$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/23/2008 1:43:52 PM$Reviewer: Cuteboy, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$1$My 6, year old grandson was given this drug due to his being unable to sit still or stop talking.and he would not listen very good,alway doing what he should not. He is very smart but lost insrented in just a few minutes.His mind seem to go faster then it should. I gave him 1 pill on a Saturday to see what it made him do,so he would be at home. And thank God I did that pill made my poor child go wild,he was so nervous,he jerked all over.That pill like to have caused my poor child go crazy,may I say I would not give my child another one of thoes pills for a million dollars. he ask me please don't give me another pill.believe me I didn't. now he is getting a bit older and is settling down on his self I cut back on sweets and dranks such as cokes.I advised all to be very careful of Ritalin.I believe this is a very bad drug.or it was for my child.

I was Diagnosed 3 years ago after being advised to do so by a colloge professor.  Thank God I did. I had immediate major improvement on day 1.  I started on the non time lapsed dose and it made me crash hard;I would end up with headaches. I loved the effects, but the headaches were becoming daily problems. My doctor put me on the time lapsed pills and I have been good for over a year now.  I graduated high school with a 1.2 G.P.A, barely getting by. Stupidity was acceptance when it came to my self image. I am currently in college finishing up my degree with a 4.0. G.P.A. Not bad considering I was expelled from my first high school and maintained less than C average most of my life. It causes some jitters at first, like way to much coffee jitters, but that subsides over time. It pulls your focus so you stay in 1 lane at a time by filing your thoughts. It feels good to finally see your mind as a gift instead of a curse. Afterall, we are some quick thinkers, so just imagine being able to organize all those precious thoughts to be saved for the right time and place. Good Luck!
585$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/13/2008 3:23:45 PM$Reviewer: worried fiance, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $4$1$5$"My fiance has been the one taking the ritalin. He has had all the typical ADD problems all his life but has just recently started taking it. The only problem is, he has a tendency to abuse drugs. Last month he went thru 30 of them in one week. This month I am distributing them to him, but if he found them I know what would happen. I do believe they help him, but it brings back too many memories of his ""cocaine"" days. He doesn't sleep well and tends to keep me up. I'm just not sure how to handle it, whether I should talk to his doctor or if his doctor would even talk to me. I'm worried."

Went to Family practice physician and after trial and error of medications I found Retalin non time released tablets to work best.  I was placed on the maximum amount of medication allowed per month by a regular MD which was one 20mg. tabled 3 x daily.  Now after being on this dosage for a few years it just dosent have the effect it once did.  I was maxed out by my physician which gave me no choice but to stay at the same level of medicaiton.  I lost my health insurance and this med (generic or not) just is not available thru a discount pharmacy (walmart, etc).  I lost my job (again) and always struggle financially.  I want to stop the cycle of constant struggle.  I have not afforded or had regular couseling or guidance due to little income.  I feel little to no effects from the drug and need a higher dosage to get back on track.  The family practive physician can not up my dosage and I do not know how to go about getting past this.  I have heard of children on higher dosage's than me.  Is there help for me?  How can I get passed this?

It worked very well the first day, but we went through atleast a month of restless nights, that have finally gotten better with time.  It has had to be increased to three times a day already and he still cannot sit still or concentrate at all.  It may be a cure-all for some, but not for our family.  He is not able to go to school even on the medication.  It does not seem to have disturbed his height, but he has lost about ten pounds in the time that he has been on it.  Mealtime is not any fun around here.  He cannot sit still enough to even eat without leaving the table atleast once.  He has been changed to Vyvanse now, we are hoping for better results.

I have only been taking Ritalin for a few weeks - but I notice a big change. I can focus so well. I don't have to read and re-read something to ""get it"". It does seem to wear off about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so I know I need to get all my school work done in the morning to maintain my ""focus""  
It has been a great help to me."

602$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/23/2008 10:22:34 PM$Reviewer: $5$5$3$"Taking 10mg tab @ rate 6/day of immediate release. I'm a 200lb male.  Not quite enough mg's to get through day but better than the ""2 pot a day"" coffee habit that I had before. I did not seek treatment until 30 years of age and so I did not take Ritalin until then.  At 30yrs of age I finally had a neuropsyc exam to see if there were any learning disabilities.  Diag'ed with ADHD but also with assessed IQ at above 90% of population.  ADD is real and any who doubt it have no clue.  It's a shame they can't experience it for one day.  It was not until the neuropsyc exam, resultant ADHD diagnoses, and Ritalin script; that I found peace.  Prior to I might as well have had an IQ of 50.  This whole time I thought that I was below average IQ & ability.  I barely grad'ed H.S.  At this time my social skills were poor, I had great hyperactivity, and also no ability to focus.  Resultant poor self-esteem leading to anger/frustration and then illicit drug use to ""self-medicate"" as they say. My life was problematic before due to impulsivity as well and the usual inability to focus. Everyone around me would joke of ADD but I didn't take it seriously. After starting Ritalin I am now a college student w/3.0 avg GPA in the hardest Mathematics sequence that exists on this planet. God Bless Ritalin. I hope that parents out there with a kid who fits this description of my past doesn't fall victim to the hype that this drug is destructive. Sure, any substance can be misused.  However, if a doc recommends it for these symptoms in a person, it's worth a shot; a shot at life. My life is just beginning at and it could have started so long ago had this pharmaceutical solution been taken earlier on in my life.  Look at the long-term studies of this drug. It's track record is good and my worst day on Ritalin is still better than my better days off of it. Exercise helps, Ritalin solves. If this becomes a permanent solution then so be it.  I don't want to go back to the way it was... ever."

My information is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. I am not a doctor.

This drug seriously and I mean seriously damaged me. It enlarged my heart, gave me a heart attack, made my palms very sweaty, my body jittery and depressed most of the time and actually made my concentration many times worse. I became unable to feel rested on this drug and it took me hours to fall asleep. This drugged completely turned me against the use of any drugs in the human body. By simply giving myself large amounts of very nutrient dense foods (fresh farmers market organic produce) and completely removing all unnatural food additives (food colorings, monosodium glutamate, refined sugar...) I was able to completely cure my ADHD, feel calm and relaxed all the time. 8 hours of intense studies is now easily in reach for me. I would suggest to people that before using this drug to perhaps get off the sugar, msg, food colorings, low vitamin and mineral foods as thousands of studies show the relation between nutrition and mental abilities. Also, let me tell you that getting off this drug was very painful and saddening for me. Talk to your doctor about this, all the information that I am telling you is my own opinion and I am not a medical doctor, though I now have over 8000 thousand hours of nutritional studies. The only reason I am saying this is because I feel that if i don't say this, I am breaking the law and they will remove this review."
