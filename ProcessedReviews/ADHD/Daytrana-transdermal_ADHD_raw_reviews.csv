We tried Straterra, Vyvance, Intuniv, and Focalin XR.  All had negative side affects.  Daytranna works great.  He has all A's in school.  I like the ability to only have to use it when needed.  One big downside is the cost.  With Atena insurance, we still pay over $300 per month.  My son also had a decreased appetite on Daytrana.  So, I had him eat a big breakfast and dinner because he didn't eat lunch.  And, I give him a break in the summer so he can gain back some weight."
1$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/25/2016 10:33:56 PM$Reviewer: sncc3, 13-18 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Love love love this medicine. When I was diagnosed in elementary school, I tried Vyvanse (made me hate everyone and everything), stratera, focalin, and maybe one other, but my hatred/inability to take pills as a child and the severe mood changes that were a common side effect ruled out these options. When I began Daytrana, my mother and I immediately loved that I could take it off at any time, allowing me to be my carefree self when I wanted to be. I still love this part of the medicine as a senior in high school. After school on Fridays, I will take it off prior to any football game or social gathering and be able to be myself. It keeps me focused all day long, whether it is during school or during sporting events, and has helped me all throughout high school. When they began to be recalled and harder to find, I was very upset, but luckily I've figured out a way to wear multiple of smaller dosages to continue using them. I also take Focalin (now that I take pills easily) in the event that a patch is not available, but daytrana works far better and helped me get around the adversity I had towards pills at a young age.  
2$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/16/2015 12:03:51 PM$Reviewer: apple, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed Daytrana for 5 years ago and have been taking it since. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in 3rd grade and my grades have always been up and down. I am 19 now, and I can honestly say it has helped me get through college level courses in highschool and college. I have tried stattera, adderall, and ritilan and find that this is the best ADHD drug for me. I love that I can take it off when the side effects start coming into play. The only complaint I have is that when I first started taking it I had virtually no appetite and became critically underweight and eventually started fainting. I was able to over come this by taking it off after a couple hours, I also sometimes only take half the patch if I know I'm going to be around a lot of people (It does affect my personality when I'm on it, but the bad outweighs the good).
3$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$3/5/2015 12:05:09 AM$Reviewer: Lizzie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I am 36 years old and have been using Daytrana for around 8 years.  I didn't start medication for ADHD until I was 20 and failing out of college without my parents around to help me study.  Ritalin, then Adderall and concerta were life changing in the fact that I was finally able to understand and actually learn things in a classroom setting.  However, the pills were easy to abuse and very hard to come down from, especially when I was up to a higher dosage.  Daytrana has been a huge help in my adult life.  The downside is that when I don't wear the patch, I am severely tired and sleepy.
5$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/7/2014 7:43:05 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$3$4$I'm a senior in high school and I have been taking daytrana since around 7th grade. It works so well!! I'm always focused in class, I get my homework done, and I can study for long periods of time!! My grades have defiantly benefited! But while using this medication, I stopes being myself. I can't talk to friends in class and it's very difficult to make friends. That has really hurt my high school experience. Also, when I'm taking tests I get bad anxiety and then am unable to comprehend the questions. Lately, my nervousness has been getting worse! I don't know if that's just because of senior year or because of this medication! All in all, this medication really works!! It's good for people who want to control how much they are getting and for how long.

I did find that if I applied an ice cube to the back (the part you peel off) at the point you are supposed to pull, it pops up much easier.  Up till I figured that out, I was wasting 1 out of 3.  I just run the cube over one point for a moment, then bend it so it popps up, then kinda fold it so it doesn't restick. Then to the other side and repeat the process.  Other than this and a bit of a red welt after usage, it is better than pills.

I tried several oral medications before we found this one.  I can tell a difference when I don't take it.  Even my husband will notices a difference. This drug has changed my life. 
12$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/8/2014 12:17:51 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$5$1$1$I hate transdermal patches. If I forget to take it off on time, my skin gets really red. Plus, if you need to take 60 mg, the rotation of the placement of patches gets screwed up. You have to shave your legs if you're planning to take daytrana. 
13$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/23/2014 9:25:40 PM$Reviewer: Emily, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I was diagnosed with ADHD six years ago when I was in second grade and around eight years old, and the doctor recommended this to me. It did not help at all; it sucked the life out of me, and made me aggressive and unlike myself. I was taken off the medication after a month or so, and was taught how to manage my ADHD without the aid of a medicine.
14$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/13/2014 2:29:16 PM$Reviewer: SLPOLLOCK, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I started with a 10 MG patch and have been moved to a 30 MG patch of the last few months.  The medication seems to be working better then I expected.  My only issue is when I remove the patch it is tearing up my skin.  I move it from my right hip to my left hip every other day.  I have tried a number of prescription ointments but none seem to provide much relief from the raw skin pain.  I do not know how much longer it will be when the 30 MG will not be enough.  My body adjust to medications fairly quickly and I need to keep increasing the doses.
15$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/15/2013 6:30:43 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I started taking Daytrana because Concerta suppressed my appetite too much and I was dangerously underweight. At first, I really like the medicine. But after about two months I developed sinus tachycardia (fast heartbeat). I didn't realize at the time that it was most likely from the Daytrana. I also thought that I somehow developed allergies to everything because I had a stuffy nose and headaches all the time. I was tested though and it turns out I don't have any. I have pretty good reason to believe that all of these (and other symptoms unmentioned) were a result of the use of Daytrana. The problem is now that I have a heart condition, I'm not supposed to take stimulants for my ADHD which causes quite a problem.

18$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/7/2013 7:59:55 PM$Reviewer: ccxrevan, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$4$I'm currently 16 (soon to be 17 in 1 month), a junior in high school, and have been taking this since my freshman year, and it has made a huge difference in helping to quell my ADHD. Before I was on this, I had pretty bad grades in school, and had little motivation to do work, but ever since first quarter sophomore year I've had a GPA over 3.85, with straight A's all of sophomore year. I use the 30mg patch every day, including weekends, and generally takes about 2 hours to fully kick in once applied and another 2 hours to wear off once removed. I have definitely noticed the weight loss and loss of appetite, so making myself eat a big breakfast before the patch takes effect and forcing myself to eat something once the patch is working is essential. I've also noticed that I sweat greatly from my armpits when I take this, dripping down my arms and into my shirt as a  liquid throughout the day. I've definitely felt some nausea, muscle twiches, and dizziness as side effects, along with headaches, but these are also related to how I feel if I haven't eaten in a while, thanks to the patch. Also, sometimes after I have removed the patch and I'm waiting for it to wear off, I feel like I have nothing to do and my mind draws a blank, and I may have slight mood swings, but they're nothing serious and I just let them pass. I play tennis several days a week and the patch has no negative effects on my play or my physical ability, and even helps me focus more on it. Overall I'd say this is a very helpful medication for someone who has yet to be able to swallow pills and needs a good medication for ADHD.

With daytrana he has mostly loss of appetite, insomia, and some area redness, I normally tell him to wash it with lots of soap when he showers and then I apply a small amount of vaseline to the area to losen up the adhesive if some still remains. I also alternate locations daily as I apply the patach,for the insominia me and my husband try to get him a good workout before bed by having a light jog, or brisk walk or bike ride around the neighborhood, believe me this helps!. Overall this medication seems easier on his stomach as far as nausea, he has not been complainging of headaches and dizziness like before with the pills. Like others has said when he's not on the patch or when it wears off he will eat and that makes me feel better. I feel better not giving him oral medications everyday, I like the conveinence of putting it on while he is still asleep before he starts his school day. Once he awakes I still have to give him motivation to complete his morning dressing routine.I hope this helps someone.

I previously was unable to get grades above a C and I am currently on the Dean's list working on my bachelors degree in accounting.  Side effects experienced have ranged from minimal insomnia to weight loss and loss of appetite.  The weight loss and loss of appetite were a blessing.  The only bad side effect was increased heart rate while exercising for cardio - I felt like I was having a heart attack thus I needed to alter my workout program to decrease cardio and concentrate on weights and muscle tone.  My doctor made this decision for this medication based on my inability to swallow pills and I couldn't be happier with the results.  I wish I had been diagnosed years earlier.

She mostly does well but a few days I haven't put it on (trying to give her a break from it since it's summer) but the last few times I've had her off it she's been ""zombie-like"" which scares me!

26$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/18/2012 5:54:53 PM$Reviewer: AddisonLPERK, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$"Daytrana, although a patch, should not be taken lightly. Shire Pharmaceuticals has created a sleeping beast that is waiting to be abused in the rave scene. At high amounts (both transdermal and chewing), daytrana creates a euphoria unlike any other drug on the market. It's the consistent energy and speed rush of coke, along with the head high and utter euphoria of ecstasy. Daytrana needs to be controlled FAST otherwise abuse will be mainstream. MPH is a drug not to be taken lightly and should be re-evaluated. 

On the other side of the spectrum, Daytrana has helped me TREMENDOUSLY! I suffer from ADHD and ADD (associative depressive disorder) and let me tell you, daytrana helps me more than any mood booster and stimulant on the market. It gives me the daily drive to actually WANT to do things no matter how menial it may be. I feel that I'll be able to take whatever the day throws at me and turn it around to produce an absolute masterpiece. If controlled, Daytrana could very well be the ""wonder"" medicine for those who suffer from depression and also ADHD  "

The adhesive causes extreme irritation to the point where the skin is broken.  We've been trying to manage that with lotions and making sure the adhesive is removed at night. Some loss of appetite and moodiness, But for now, the best we've found. Daytrana customer service is also very helpful.

I've been taking Daytrana for a little over a month now.  At first, my psychiatrist prescribed me 10 milligrams to start out with.  It worked okay, not the best results when I was on Vyvanse.  However, Vyvanse gave me extreme side effects and I was verbally aggressive. My grades were awesome but, my mood was terrible.  After awhile taking the 10 milligram of Daytrana, my attention span wore off and it became ineffective.  So, my psychiatrist then prescribed me with 20 milligrams.  After two days off taking it, I've experienced extreme tiredness and dizziness, I feel as if I'm living my life through a daze. Also, I've been experiencing a dry mouth, loss of appetite, fatigue and nausea. I have even more difficulty studying and being able to focus my attention in my classes. I have finals next week and I'm extremely worried with the outcome of my grades.  I'm not pleased with how my body is taking effect from this non stimulant drug.

It starts working like 2 hours after being applied.  I can tell the exxact second it is in his system.  He calms down.  He is able to sit still.  Does not talk to fast and maintains a great ddisposition.  The bad parts are that he doesn't eat while on it.  If he is on it an may want a snack, I let him have what ever he wants.  But, boy watch out when he is off of it... He eats me out of the house.  He eats like a grown man.  The other down fall is insomnia.  He has a hard time getting to sleep, so every other day he gets an all natural sleep aid.  I HATE having him on medication and really hope he out grows it, but this seemed to be the best medication for him.  It makse his skin red when we take it off, but good lotion helps soothes it.

35$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$4/25/2011 10:32:27 PM$Reviewer: 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $4$4$3$My son started on this medication about 2 years ago. It has been the best medicine to contol his ADHD (clinically significant). It does take some time to kick in and it does wear off about 2 hours after it comes off. To deal with the minor skin irritation we use Benadryl cream every night on the spots. We also used a 4 spot rotation. Top and bottom left and right. He is able to focus in school and still has a personality. The only major drawback is the consistency with which the patches come off the plastic backing. One box will have no problems and the next box the backing worn't peel off. We have tried other oral meds for him but all of them seemed to overdose him and cause major stomach issues. We like that this one does not have to go through the digestive system so he will still eat.

I always had ups and downs with Ritalin but with Daytrana a 30mg Patch last me from 6:00am till when I get off work at 5:00pm or when I want to take it off. I believe it would last a full 24 hours if you left it on.  I had absolutely Zero Rebound. I should have gave it a try years ago.  I'm a 31 year old male, so I can probably speak for that age range, so not so sure how it would affect a child.  I love just having to apply the patch once in morning and dont have to worry about having to remember to take another dose)s) during the day. I would suggest to everyone to at least give Daytrana a try.  I've heard of a lot of people having rashes from the patch, but nothing happened to my skin. and I have extremely sensitive skin to detergents and soaps, so I was surprised that it didn't bother me. If yo have any questions, email me at [email protected] and I will be glad to answer anything if I can.

And if he sleeps in (like most teenagers do)I can still have him remove it early to control the time it is in his system which is something you can't do with an oral medication.

Recently, we have had trouble filling the prescription at any of our local pharmacies - they are telling us they can't get it within a week.  And because of the extreme heat here this summer, our mail order was ruined.  I wish they could mail them in dry ice, or the local pharmacy could get them without any delay.

No more taking pills to school, no more peaks and troughs through out the day, and a definite decrease in anger and aggression. We use a 4x6 op-site in the summer to cover it so he can go swimming like all the other kids and he really truly acts like all the other 10 year old boys.

She is doing so much better after 6 weeks..I cannot believe the difference! She does get a red mark from where it is and eats a little less when it is on. I too do not put it on her on weekends and days off! I gotta let her get all that energy out!! Overall I am soooo happy with the results!

I also did not want to medicate, but there were very few natural choices that worked. Did the fish oils, outdoor activities, and he was still very unhappy and his school work and behavior at school was failing.  He is very smart and it is very frustrating for him to not be able to work. I put the patch on in the mornings right before he finishes breakfast. It usually takes an hour or so to kick in..teachers say 2 hours..but his work is completed and his behavior is good. my biggest problem and it is very scary is that he will not eat at all when he is on the patch...he complains that it makes him nauseous if he does..so he will not eat until dinner time..i can't get him to drink anything or snack. i tried pbj sandwiches, instant shakes, protein shakes, etc..nothing. he is VERY skinny..i know he will fight me on the pills so i keep the patch..wondering what others have done in my situation.  patch redness i use aquaphor, it was worst in the beginning, but better now. I also use baby oil after showers to keep area moist and control the dryness. also for the person that has trouble with getting the patch off the backing..I never throw these away..they are very expensive:-) I warm it up in my fingers first..it makes it easier to remove the backing. just rub it between your fingers for a few minutes, it has worked for me..cause I had her same trouble in the beginning. I wish there was more I could do for him...it's very hard to see them deal with this. thanks,

The only downfalls with it are the rash from the patch. It gets red and itchy at the site. We put aquaphor on it after removal which helps but still bothers my son. Also we give to him at 7am and it takes awhile at school to kick in so I get some complaints about his behavior in the morning. So have to wake up an hour earlier at 5:30-6am to put it on. Other than that he has gotten all A's and B's where he was just passing. Is soooo much calmer and can concentrate on his work.  Hope this helps.

I like it a lot, and it is really helpful, but I do struggle with trying to figure out how to keep my hips from getting irritated. I have not had a lot of problems with it. When I first started taking Daytrana, I took 40mg for a while, but that was too much, it kind of suppressed my personality, and it was not good. Now I am on 30mg, and much happier. It is kind of a bummer that it is so big, but I like the control I have over when I take it. I still struggle a lot with school, but I think that may partly be because I got diagnosed so late. I didn't get diagnosed until 8th grade, and then it has taken a long time to figure out how I really work. I also struggle with sleeping and eating. I have also found that it is really important for me to be active during the day, which helps me sleep later, and also helps me focus. 
I have had an adverse reaction with Clonadine, when I took more than 0.2mg I think. 
I would recommend creating structure for your kids, and teaching them self-discipline early on. Sports, music, and dance are great ways to do this. I really like the structure of ballet. 
Good Luck!"

The doctor would always put him on a pill of some kind to treat it. He couldn't and still can not take pills. FINALLY, at age 10, his doctor finally listens to me and gives him the patch after i requested it twice. He has done so well while on the patch. Only side effects are a red spot where the patch is located(most common side effect) and within an hour after taking it off, he has this 30 minute spell of sadness from being bored. Even though there s a lot for him to do, he thinks there is nothing to do and gets sad because he is bored. Other than that, it is a miracle patch. My son actually enjoys taking it bc it doesnt have the side effects as the pills. Mainly, his stomach doesnt hurt with the patch.

Me & my husband have been getting complaints since he was 3 and in daycare about his behavior. Although his adhd is part of who he is it also hinders relations with other kids his age, school activities, home life. We put off medicating for as long as we could until he was in to the school system. We went through may meds. at first. concerta, adderall, focalinXR. Focalin was great but my son started to refuse the pill. I felt so defeated!! I then read up on the Daytrana patch & asked his Doctor if this would be an option for him. Well Let me just start by saying this is the best thing I could have asked for for my Jade. He takes the 10mg patch and has been for about a month & a half now. He is more social at school. Getting better every day with school work & at home we only have to ask him to do things once as opposed to 10-15 reminders. I know you know what I mean by that!! No side effect other than redness that goes away by the next day. He eats well & and falls asleep around 9:30pm verses 8:30pm. I only give this to my son on school days not on weekends, holidays, snowdays. This is only for learning purposes. Good luck to you all who struggle with this illness or have love ones who are effected. It is the hardest thing I have had to watch but don't give up you will find something that will work!!

Nothing seemed to work except eliminating food dyes brought the hyperactive down but still could not focus. Heard about the patch and so far so good no real side effects except a pink spot on the hip and for the first time in a long time he felt good about himself in school. Grades are going up and assignments are completed. What I love most about it is you have control over the patch when you need it. Would highly reccomend as a first try before trying pills.

We like it because we can put it on whenever he goes to school or if we plan something, and not put it on when he doesnt have school or is on break. We started out on 10mg and upped the the dose to 15mg.After dose being upped what a world of a diff. The teachers havnt called home or sent home pink slips in over 2 weeks.(We decided not to tell teachers he was on as we wanted to see if they noticed a differance also in school as we have at home). The only complaint is getting the plastic off the back to stick it on his thigh..We have wasted a few trying to get it to peel away. He does have redness when takin off but it goes away after a few hours, and he has comlained a few times that it itches. The only side affect we are trying to get through is his moodiness.(Outburst of crying for no reason) He was drawling a pic and messed up and started balling.So far we are loving our son on the patch as we can do more with him now and hes doing way better in school.

We delayed meds as long as possible, but his ADD is severe. Worked fantastic for 2 years.  Besides drastically improving school academic performance, it actually lessened his overall anxiety level and moodiness/irritability--it was like having our ""old"" good natured son back.  Minor patch application/skin issues outwieghed by wonderful results. However, after 2 years he developed severe and unrelenting stomach pains (even morphine drip in hospital for one week didn't help at one point).  Stopped the med and stomach pain stopped within 1 week (after several months of abdominal pain and mis-disagnoses, no one initially thought it could be the ADD med and he was tested for everything else under the sun).  On Vyvanse now for 1 year and hate it.  Works on the ADD (still doing well academically) but causes him negative personality changes, lots of sadness, anger, irritation and outbursts. Hard for both siblings and parents to handle his constant irritation, complaining and outright meanness. We miss our son. Hoping the neurologist puts him back on Daytrana and that it works for a while before the stomach pain hits again...(thats how good Daytrana works compared to the side effects of Vyvanse, that I would even consider risking exposing my son to that pain again)..."

The only drawback is that when I forget to take off the patch after 9 hours, I tend to have a harder time falling asleep.

There have been a lot of great results over the past few months but there is one particular effect, that I feel is a great example of how this drug has worked for me, can be seen in my golf game.   I have been a 13 handicap for the past 5 years.  Since I have been on Daytrana in the past 4 months, my handicap has dropped to a 6.  My focus and concentration has improved so much.  I cant stress enough that I absolutely can attribute the considerable drop in my handicap to Daytrana.

You can take that for what its worth.

73$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/29/2009 4:32:27 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been reading all of the posts and often wish I could respond to some of them.  I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and have tried several...if not all of the stimulant medications.  I have had a couple of problems, one is that my body metabolizes them to fast, so they never last as long as what they should; however a higher dosage just makes me tense, and 2 they all seem to make me mean with no sense of humor at all.  Although, I would not say that Daytrana is the most effective stimulant, it is the most effective for the least amount of side effects.  The biggest downfalls seem to be the mark that it leaves and that it takes at least 2 hours to kick in.  As far as the people who are complaining that 9 hours isn't long enough, the truth is there it enough medication on the patch to last 15 hours if needed.  Also, I have not had problems  with the sticky stuff coming off or it not sticking to me; however I did go off of it for a year to try vyvanse and have just gone back on it recently, so maybe I missed that recall.  With that being said, it is important that it doesn't get too hot or too cold...you don't want to keep it in the bathroom where it can get too hot and humid.  Also, make sure you apply it with warm hands and rub it on your skin for a good 60 seconds or so to activate the sticky stuff which will make it stick better...I put it on and then take a really hot bath which often helps make it stick.

We had 3 different doctors confirm diagnosis before we took any additional steps.  Right now, the main problem is his hyperactivity and impulsiveness.  The daytrana patch is a lifesaver!  Especially at his young age, he wouldn't swallow the pills.  He actually refers to the patch as his special bandaid that helps him be good.  We did have sleep issues also.  He is so hyper that he would stay awake all night long.  The doctors did give him a pill to help sleep at night and that has also been a lifesaver.  The Daytrana has helped him act more like a normal kid and help him focus more in preschool.  There are only 2 problems we've had with this medicine: his appetite is poor for lunch.  Breakfat and supper are the best.  Before the patch and after you take it off.  I always give him a good snack before bed such as a bowl of cereal to help replace what he missed earlier in the day.  The other is the skin irritation.  We found that using olive oil to remover the patch helps remove all the adhesive and also lubricates the skin.  I also use Eucerin cream to help keep the skin from getting dry.  I hope this helps!

Also don't put it in exactly the same spot every time, move it around the hip, but becareful not to get it in the crease of their leg this will make sitting very uncomfortable. I did that once and he took it off. Not good. After a while we needed to increase the dose from 20mg to 30mg. At first it was great! But after a while I noticed things in his personality that weren't quit like him. For instance he was extremely sensitive and would have meltdowns for no reason. He got kind of paranoid about things.He saw a spider in the school bathroom and wouldn't go to the bathroom all day.It freaked him out!Not just ""no I don't need to go"",it was"" no don't make me go in there!"",like this was a giant ""Harry Potter"" spider and its going to get me.He also once wouldn't come in the house after the bus dropped him off because he didn't see the car in the driveway,it was in the garage.So he sat in the front yard and a neighbor called me to tell me she was standing with him in the yard cuz he was scared to go inside. What?? This was really not like him at all!This waS Just from uping the dose by 10mg. So we switched to Vyvanse. We've liked that so far....   "

It was a very trying time for him and I. We did and IEP, and found a school (public) that we could send him to that takes care of childern like mine, with the medication and the school I have seen a great deal of difference. He doesn't hit, he can focus, he is his teacher's ""work aholic"" and can complete tasks when given to him. He was put on the losest does which is 10mg, we recently had to put him on the 15mg, due to him regressing, hiting running around out class, not being able to concentrate, and with the new dose, it's all back to the way it should be. I was very against putting my child on medication, but his ADHD was so severe, that really I had no choice, he just started 1st grade and was already on the verge of being helf back due to him being dismissed so much by the other school.

His reading soared.  He is still on it in the first grade, but it is taking longer (2 hours)to kick in. There is a major difference in his handwriting when he is on the patch. I found that putting a Sponge Bob big bandaid over the patch helped him keep the patch on and keep it from rolling.

After one month on the patch, I have seen (as well as his teachers)him do a complete turn around. The patch does leave a nasty redness after removing it, the redness is still present even after 4 days, two hours after removing the patch he gets very emotional and demanding. The only MAJOR problem I have with the patch is the cost, I was recently laid off and now I have to pay well over $150.00 for a 30 day supply, taking the pill is just not right for him since he has major problems swallowing anything in pill form. I honestly think this drug is great and I will continue to give it to him no matter what the cost may be."

We had a good 1st month with it. He was focusing on work at school, following teachers directions, & not being distracted. And much less hyper at home...it was a different child. But, after the 1st month, he started to go back to his old ways. Disrespect to teacher & classmates, not following any directions at home or school, crazy-hyperactivity. He also lost a few lbs. I had difficultly removing the backing off the patch. I was not satisfied that we had to put it on him 2 hrs before school started. Also, it left a horrible red, irritated patch on his skin when it was removed at the end of the day. He also complained that it itched alot. He told me himself that he thought it was no longer working and we needed to go back to the Dr. So, we have chg'd his med's and Vyvanse is the ""drug of choice."" Pray that it works...I may lose my mind if not!!  "
96$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/26/2008 12:59:35 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$3$"It feels like I have taken almost everything out there in the sun for my ADHD.  I am 27 years old and have an active lifestyle, meaning...working out, etc and also working about 60 hours a week.  

After taking it for 3 months, I have discontinued Daytrona, for a couple of reasons...slight mood swings, but for the most part, it just didnt feel right.

Another negative that I can say about Daytrona is those patches got to be painful at sight application many days after, which my doctor said what might help (but didnt try) was to spray nasal decongestant, benadryl, or any antahistamine to reduce irratation.)

Here is what I did like, which is one of the most important factor to me....Out of all the medications that I have taken, Daytrona was by far one of the most consistant medications that I have taken...meaning I didnt see the dips or rollercoaster feelings that I have experienced with other medications.  Also, since this medication is transdermal, none I think is processed by the liver, so any break for my liver is good.  

This might sound weird, but the reason why I discontinued isnt really anything more than a ""didnt feel right"" sensation that I cant really described.

I hope this helps someone.

BTW, if you are interested in what meds I have taken, here they are:

Adderall XR, Adderall Tablets, Concerta, Metadate, Ritalin XR, Ritalin Tablets, Vvyanse, amphetamine salt combo, and dexadrine.

The patch ahs been great! It does leave a red spot, but he handles it well and for a while there were issues with the backing not comming off. I've found that keeping them in a cool place helps this as warmth seems to make it harder to get the back off.

We started on the Dayrtana patch last year during school.  We love it.  It does leave a red place which our doctor told us to wipe gently with pure Olive Oil.  This gets all the sticky stuff off.  We love the ease of the patch and also not having to take medicine at school.  As you know other kids can sometimes be cruel and this eliminates that.  I put it on him at 6:30 am so it will kick in by school time and it last even 2 hours after it is taken off.

He's 125 lbs. I have noticed a HUGE difference w/ his mood, as before on Adderall he was a monster! The pills made him so mean, and when not taking them for a day, he was happy, sweet, but impulsive and too hyper. I know it is the meds. making him this way! With the patch now for a week, he is so much more happy, and no violent mood swings yet. The patch does make him itchy. I will try hydrocortisone at night. One of his hips he will not let me put the patch (too itchy when on) and between his shoulder blades is out (too itchy) so now we are using 1 hip, and moving it around to new areas on same side. All this trouble is still better than the pills! He has also taken Vyvanse (horrible side effects- very sleepy,lethargic, & angry) and most recently Adderall (never again)Right now the patch is the best for him. Also I bought a box of alcohol wipe pads from Walgreens (very cheap) and wipe his skin with 1 before and when I take a patch off. Really helps!

I tested so high, my Dr was amazed I graduated college.  I am disabled, and have had aprrox 80% of my intestines removed, so I can barely absorb medications, esp in pill form.  Daytrana has been the most effective med I have found for my ADD.  However, I have run into 2 major issues.  First, I have found that the longer I have been on the patch (30 mg for 18 months), it has become less effective as my tolerance has built up to the med.  Secondly, almost every box I get contains at least 10 patches that are unusable due to the medicine coming off by sticking to the backing.  I know there have been several recalls, but I still keep running into this problem, which causes me to request a new prescription early.  This raises the ? of whether or not I am abusing the patches, i.e. using more than 1 per day, which I am definitely not.  Being an adult, my Dr seemed wary with my claim of lessening effectiveness over time combined w/the adhesive problems.  Should there be any other adults out there experiencing this same problem, I suggest the following: Go to the Shire website as well as other reviews of Daytrana that describe problems w/the backing and print them out.  Also, if you don't use the time on/off card attached to the box, start and mark the days where you could not use a patch and had to open and use another one.  Make sure you constantly report problems to your pharmacist so they will know you are having problems.  A lot of Docs these days are overcautious when prescribing controlled meds over fear of addiction and malpractice claims.  Keeping these records and alerting your pharmacy will help you alleviate those fears. This is an excellent med and can really help adults w/ADD.  However, if you are abusing this med and use these tips in furtherance of your abuse, you are doing so at the risk of dangerous consequences to both yourself, as well as hurting we who have benefited from Daytrana.

This worked so much better than the others (and we've tried them all).  She has anxiety disorder and this makes it worse.  She has the ""ritalin effect"" in that she sits and picks at her skin.  Her personality is the same on as off, except she's more focused and less hyper on it.  The worse side effects are sleeplessness and no appetite.  We give her Melatonin supplements to help her fall asleep and she's on a high calorie diet (she also has sensory problems so she's very sensitive about food to begin with).  Sometimes the backing is difficult to get off the patch and I do have to use medical tape to keep it from peeling off, mostly to be insurance that she won't take it off.  I notice that she talks in circles - repeats herself mid-sentence, and is very hard to follow in conversation while on the meds. I'm only satisfied with this medication because the others we've tried made her aggressive and emotional.  Otherwise, there isn't any medication which helps her without a drawback."

My son was struggling in school. Not because he was not trying but because he said it is getting so hard. My teacher goes so fast.He has always been the kid who other kids like to be around fun/sweet.  He was the kid other parents wanted to have over because of his manners. When the doctor said he has adhd try this patch I just didn't think it would work.  To my surprise we put the patch on a Saturday morning. We waited 1 hour to start homework.  My husband and I were astonished. We have never been able to read his writing.  We could read it.  We tried some of his 5th grade math problems.  My husband and I cried.  The kid could do math. What we like most is when he needs it we put it on when he is finished w/ school he takes it off. The teacher said she has seen other kids on ADHD medication and they seem more up and down during the day.  I love the way it works.  He started to have skin issues it itched.  Again I went to the DR and said what do we do it works but I don't want it burning a hole in his skin.  He said we needed to keep skin moist all the time esp winter.  We stuck with it and I am so happy.His skin got used to the patch and he has been on it a year and he now asks to wear it for baskeball games because he says it helps.  I will tell you it is a lot more work than a pill but we have seen no side effects besides the skin but good grades and confidence. It is more expensive but evenings at our house are so much better we feel like we are paying more but getting a better quality of life for all of us.

We would struggle taking Adderall every morning.  9 times our of 10 we would fail in getting the medicine down him, thus resulting in poor performance at school, home and generally with life. He was diagnosed with ADHD when he was almost 11, and it's been a very long journey trying to figure out how to get him to swallow the pills.  We tried applesauce, jello, pudding, juice, pretty much everything to disguise the pill.  Recently, our pediatrician suggested the patch, Daytrana, and we absolutely love it!!  The first few days were a huge improvement for my son.  He feels better overall, still has his appetite, and most important he feel's like he's in control of himself. He has the ability to focus when he is using the patch.  My son really likes the ease of the patch, and not having to strugle over taking pills.  It's a bit difficult in removing, however it's nothing compared to being able to live a normal life.

This is the best ADHD medicine he has ever used.  My son made the A/B Honor Roll this year. He has been on the patch for 2yrs now, and he has exceled in school the past two years.  The Daytrana treats his ADHD, but it also allows him to keep his appetite.  The other medicines did not give him this option.  I recommend Daytrana to everyone.  My son was diagnosed when he was four, he is now nine and this has been the best medicine he has been on.  He has tried 6 different types and this is the only one that has the best results for him.

I have taken everything and with the pills i would loss so much weight, but with the patch i have lost some but not as much as i did with being on the pill. The adhesive does stay on the skin and it can take a week or so to get off i dont mind it at all.I can tell when i miss a day, i become really irritated and cranky. Other then that i recommend this to anyone that hates pills.I saw a diffrence within the first 3 days.

This drug was my last hope since my son who was 6 refused to try any more pills. This drug improved all his problems including his aggretion and violent issues. he's been on it for 1 1/2 year with great results and some small side effects. like irrated skin which was easily treated. we feed him healthy large meals for breakfast and dinner because he losses his hunger when patch is on. my son was to young at first to understand why he was being medicated, but when he started with daytrana he told me how the patch makes him a ""happy boy"" and how being bryce(his name) was easier now. Only downfall is after a year of usage we've had to increase his dosage and it takes twice as long to kick in (around 60 to 45 minutes)now. this medicine gave me a son i never knew i had and has made my family's life much easier. He had been kicked out of 4 daycare/schools now he's in 1st grade with excellent grades and he's even his teachers favorite student. "

149$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/9/2007 7:25:13 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$2$"the great thing about this (as an adult with adhd) is put it on once and it lasts all day - no bottles of pills to pop all day.  Also it is a constant rate of delivery eliminating the annoying ups and downs with immediate duration meds.  third bypassing intestinal system means less variability over food eaten.  Well it sounds good in theory.

I find it works, but less constantly than theory would suggest.  3 hour lag before initial dose works, 3 hours before bed remove patch or you will be up all night.  patch is flimsy and rips when attempting to put it on.  not as effective as focalin instant release.

however it's effective enough, it keeps me in a balance over the day rather than up and down, no pills to carry and lose, etc

I feel the biggest thing is the smoothing of the ups and downs experienced with 3 hour ritalin; and the lack of food (esp fatty food) delaying onset of next dose.

I've been on it a week and am going to try it for at least a month before deciding; but I really hope i can get more predictability and constant effect as time goes on."

It helps alot. Altough the patches are a pain in the butt.I would suggest this med for adults as well as children. I am an adult and I take daytrana daily.One 20 mg. patch works very well.

 For the passed 3 yrs I have been experimenting with a lot of the ADHD meds out there, and have had no success. I recently decided that as a last resort I would try Daytrana, my other option was going to be quit the ADHD meds all together. This one is the only medication that I can control how long I need it, have no apitite loss, and have experienced No negitive side effects! i am 17 and in high school and have every intension of using this product on into collage!"

I advise anyone who is using this to document all behaviour every day and as soon as you ebgin to see escalation i would call the MD and STOP meds!!  This could have been deadly for his little sister and has left me with bruises and emotional scars no mother who just wants to help her son should have to deal with...worse, my son has never forgiven himself, even though we have and told him we have....too much burden for an 8 year old!
