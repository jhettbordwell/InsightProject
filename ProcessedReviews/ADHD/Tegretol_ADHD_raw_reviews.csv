ALSO HAVE ADHD, BUT ON ADDERALL FOR THAT AND THEN KLONOPINS FOR PANIC ATTACKS. CARBAMAZEPHINE HAS WORKED FOR ME FOR MY SEIZURES DUE TO YEARS OF ABUSING OPIODS. I'D HAVE TO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE PPL HERE, ALSO HAVE TROUBLE WITH LEARNING NEW TRADES , DECREASED DRIVE AND SOMETIMES TIREDNESS ,ANTI-SOCIAL, NOT TOO MUCH ON WEIGHT GAIN. THERES PROBABLY FEW MORE, MY APOLOGIES. I'LL TRY TO REPOST THEM HOPING IT'LL HELP AT LEAST 1 PERSON OR MORE. OVERALL AT THE MOMENT THO, FOR MY SEIZURES, I HAVENT SCARED MY GF FOR 2 YRS AND COUPLE MONTHS, MY NATIONALITY IS ASIAN, AGE 38, USUAL ROUTINE ON LIFE, STARTED WITH MARY J. AND THEN DRINKING, SMOKE CIGARETTES FOR 23 YEARS AND STARTED VAPING TO QUIT, NOT SURE IF IM GOIN OFF SUBJECT , BUT BASICALLY EVERYONES DIFFERENT AND THE MEDICATIONS HAVE THEIR UPS AND DOWNS. SO FOR ME, MY SEIZURES WERE THE REASON IM ON THEM AND ID LIKE TO STOP TAKING CARBAMAZEPHINE EVENTUALLY. LOOKING INTO A LITTLE MORE NATURAL REMEDIES? CBD OILS ? LOL.! IM HOPING THO. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ARENT SET WELL FOR THAT YET HERE , BUT WE DONT LIVE FOR EVER ALSO, SO TRY AND HOPEFULLY THIS CARBAMAZEPHINE WORKS OR DOESNT, FOR WHOEVER , TOOK TIME TO READ THIS. I PRAY YOU FIND A LIL PEACE OF MIND FROM WHAT EVER YOU'VE ENDURED TO GET HERE. WHICHEVR OR WHOEVER YOUR GOD...BLESS
