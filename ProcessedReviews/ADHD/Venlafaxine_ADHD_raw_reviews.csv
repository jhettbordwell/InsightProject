637$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$6/21/2011 5:14:07 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$1$3$This medication works but the side effects for me at least are extreme sweating and weight gain.  I'm miserable.  I sweat profusely with just the littlest activity.  Head sweats are terrible.  I need to stop this medication because my legs and ankles are all just retaining water like mad but do I have to check myself into a hospital to get through the withdrawal symptoms?  I've tried cutting down on the dosage but I get the spins and feel like I'm gonna throw up.  I'm not sure what to do but I'm not happy being on this.  I've never gained so much weight in my life.  I now weigh 185 and I haven't weighed this much since I gave birth to my daughter 18 years ago.

I have had mood swings and depression since I was 16 years old. I have always experienced extreme irritability and anger. This drug gave me back my life and helped me become the mother and wife that I had always tried to be. I now get to enjoy the holidays  without freaking out and ruining it for everyone. It also helps my ADHD!  I am so much happier now. The only problem that i have experience is that when I miss a dose, I dream long, vivid dreams all night. I always know when I miss a dose because of that. I have been on it for 5 years, and I'm afraid to quit for fear that my life will return to what it was like before. I have also read all of the horror stories of people trying to quit, and that scares me.

I went from Wellbutrin that stopped working to this one. It has worked well for these years. REading any reviews can scare a person about any drug.  I take mine first thing in the morning. I was warned not to take it later than noon because of possible insomnia.  My diagnosis ranges from depression to ""change of life"" issues, as well as ADHD.
I've been very fortunate to be able to obtain this medication and follow the dosing exactly 75 mg for me.  I do my very best to keep track of dosage and refill before I run out. For someone who uses it faithfully, it works....side effects? I haven't really had any. "

I also began menopause during that time. Took hormones, but could not tolerate them. Since taking Effexor I am more able to handle the stresses of life. It keeps me level. Much more calmer to handle situation with calmness  "
2766$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/28/2009 5:22:48 PM$Reviewer: jcfsusmc, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"Effexor has saved my life and relationships.  After going through a series of therapies for major depression, it was discovered that I had a major case of ADHD with anxiety and panic cohorts (at the age of 48!).  This diagnosis explained everything that was me.  I was referred to a PA (believe it or not!) who worked with Psych MD's and started me on Effexor.  It was almost an instant relief of my anxiety.  After two months, I was at 150mg per day.  Now, to get off ritalin without driving everyone mad.  Without ritalin, I am now on 300 mg per day, with 300 mg of Wellbutrin to boot!  Yes, I'm an extreme case, but it's disconcerting that most of the reviews are negative.

First, I was on several drugs for a while that didn't really work.  I agree that Effexor shouldn't be a first line of defense.  But if it works, why worry about the withdrawals?  I don't ever want to stop taking Effexor.  My wife and kids can approach me 24/7 even with bad news.  I have no stress except eustress.  I can keep my cool, ignore messy people, gossip, and know it alls!

One other thing - why is Effexor not advertised (by the doctors) more for treatment of moderate to severe AD/HD?

I have nothing but high praise for Effexor.  It saved my marriage, my family, my work, among other things."

These contributed to anger outbursts and saying stupid remarks for no reason.

I have been on it for about four months presently at 150 mg. The best thing I ever did. Tried Ritalin at first. It was totally unsatisfactory and inconvenient.

So far main side effect has been tiredness, but it's going away now. Also some nausea in first month, but again that has disappeared."
3101$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/22/2009 9:47:00 PM$Reviewer: lea2529, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been on Effexor XR for a total of 3 years. I was on it for a year before I had my son and have been on it for 2 years after he was born. I have ADHD with anxiety and depression. I started out at 75mg and am now at 225mg. This has been the only medication that has worked for all of my symptoms. I couldn't believe how well it worked in the beginning. My concentration was amazing. I didn't even know that it was possible to feel like that. I had tried Zoloft, Cymbalta, Aderall and many others that I don't even remember. I feel like I've tried everything. I do have to say that there are terrible withdrawal symptoms when you go off of it. I went off of it cold turkey off of 150mg when I was trying to get pregnant. Now that I have been on it for 2 years straight I am scared of going through the withdrawal again but I have started noticing a resistance to it.

I went back to Dexedrine after 2 months of Effexor."

3739$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/17/2008 11:02:12 AM$Reviewer: sammy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Maybe I shouldn't have been put on this at all as my depression way mild to moderate. After 4 days I actually felt suicidal for the first time in my life. Very scary. I called my doc and was immediately taken off. This can be very helpful, but use with caution and take a few days off work at first, the nausea is bad.

I am in sales and my production has increased 200%. I take the effexor 150mg in the morning and the adderal around noon. These two drugs have been life changing and given me so much more patience with clients and family.
