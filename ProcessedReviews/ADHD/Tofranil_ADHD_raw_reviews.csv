The only downfalls are all the side-affects. I became very sleepless,and a little more irritable. I also sweat excessivly, and my body gets the shakes.

to a 5 yr. old.  He still has nightmares, goes into rages and tells you what he will do if he does not get his way.  Every day is a challange. in a second, he will change and become the sweetest boy around, thoughtful, loving to his younger siblings.  He did come from an abusive home and we adopted all 3 boys and they are fine.  He sneaks around at night and of course gets the other 2 in trouble.  When he goes into his rages, I can't tell you how much he has broken.  He is also on Intunir ER 3 mg.  He shakes cannot sleep but will go to sleep in school.  I feel really bad for him"
