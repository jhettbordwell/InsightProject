When I complained to my doctor and insisted I would not take it, he threw a fit! Then I learned Medicare pays $683 to the drug-maker for this poison.

Please note I am now using Lamictal (30mgs), Geodon (80mgs), Abilify (10mgs) with 2 sleepaids (Trazadone and Ambien). I am concerned about weight  gain however.        "

I am on a dosage of 5 mg, once daily and it has been beneficial for my maintenance of the disorder. I weaned off for 4 months 5 years ago and saw a tremendous return in symptoms and until I returned to this medication and dosage in addition to my 300mg of Wellbutrin XL, my symptoms have gone away and my mind functions so much better now. No more hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, ideas of reference, etc. I am very pleased with the prescription of this medication along with the Wellbutrin XL.

After doing some kind of physical labor I easily became mentally and physically exhausted to the point where I had to lie down for a few hours.

It works really well at controlling my mood swings, thank God.  About the only thing that i dislike about it are the potential side effects, which i have not experienced with this medication, and the fact that when i stop taking this medication, for various reasons, i experience a lot of turbulence in my life.  So, that in itself indicates that i will most likely have to take this medication for the remainder of my life, and i do not like that thought.

Makes your body swell like tick.  I am male and I found milk forming behind my nipples, had to have mammogram to prove it.  Makes penis less firm and no morning wood.  It is better then other medicines which prohibit males from sex period.  I would call it the lesser of the two evils to treat impulse (what some doctors call mania), but does not help with down feeling.  I am consulting a lawyer for my long term options.  I have paid psychiatrist, psychologist, primary care physician, specialist, and consulted nutritionist.  The systems of bi-polar may be treatable with simple diet by regulating salt.  In the long term this may be more effective.  It cost allot so good luck to you.  In the short term these medicines might benefit some, but the two I have tried seem like they are more likely to shorten life span in long run.  My motto is only get as high as the ceiling and low as the floor.  I could not even cry on Abilify, my eyes slightly watered.  At this point I am trying to see what I can do to obtain life insurance, long term care, and disability insurance.  I am working with my psychiatrist and hoping I can get the nutrition approved.  I am working out 4-6 times a week and changing my diet (I wrestled in college so I feel for those with no work out experience).  Work on 5 year baseline then see what you can do to reduce or find alternative that works for you.  Maybe 3 year baseline with no issues is enough.

272$Bipolar Disorder in Remission$8/21/2014 3:17:17 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$I started this drug almost five years ago and although it has worked with being bipolar, it has done a number on me with my weight.  I never knew that it could make me gain weight and not be able to lose it.  I gained 45 lbs. in three months after starting this drug, but most drugs don't give me any side effects so I didn't think it was because of the drug.  Now having a new doctor, she has told me that this drug will not only make you gain weight, but not be able to lose it.  It's good to know there is a reason that for these past five years after repeated attempts to lose weight there is a reason I always hit a brick wall after getting to a specific weight.  I am currently being taken off the drug (slowly of course) and being put on another.  Hopefully I won't see the side effects on Paxil like on Abilify.  I am on 15 mg of Abilify which to find out is a high dose.  Who knew?

304$Bipolar Disorder in Remission$5/4/2014 4:04:08 PM$Reviewer: Josie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$5$Abilify has been part of my medication regime for more then 5 years, and for 20+ years of being over medicated I realized it's a hit or miss game, not necessarily the fault of the psychiatric med provider because their guess is as good as mine. Treatment should be a collaboration and we have the power to make a choice. Back to Abilify; in my experience it has been effective in stabilization, but massive weight gain and difficulty in losing weight has been a big problem in addition to sleeplessness. It is my opinion that it has more anti-depressant qualities, so what time of the day you take it and the milligrams you are on is important. Try tweaking the dosage and timing before you write any medication off, including Abilify. I met with a provider that did a second evaluation of my meds after 20 years of being treated at an unrelated facility. He immediately cut 8 different medications with multiple dosages of each per day down to 3 medications only one of each per day. Abilify is still part of my regime, but taking it at night caused me many sleepless nights and nightly anxiety attacks. I am now taking it during the day and it is sure to work as a great accelerant with balanced moods. Again, you must be AWARE and CAREFUL! YOU are the one ingesting this medication, not your provider! When I see my med provider again, I am going to discuss the reduction in the milligrams of Abilify I take as Abilify packs a big punch. COLLABORATION and PARTICIPATION PEOPLE! I can't stress this enough. I also recommend taking meditation classes or anything that works for you to help calm you and ease your perspective of yourself and life. YOU must take action in ASSISTING your medication therapy. A pill can not heal what ails the spirit. Warmth and Loving-kindness to you all. I hope this helps.

My legs, fingers, feet...I am always fidgeting. I also have trouble sleeping so they put me on Trazedone. It helps me stay asleep. The worst problem I have is fear of driving.

He had me on 60 (yes 60) mg of Abilify and 450 mg of Wellbutrin.  Each 150 mg of Wellbutrin increase the effect of abilify ~50%.  You do the math.  I should sue this Doc for gross negligence and possibly damaging my liver.  DO NOT TAKE ABILIFY AND WELLBUTRIN! Of course I tapered the Wellbutrin to 0 mg and quit the abilify.  The 3/4"" deep pitting from Edema in my lower legs attributed to venous insufficiency went entirely away when I quit Abilify.  The anxiousness and restlessness and sleeplessness went entirely away when I quit Abilify.  I now treat my serious bipolar I with dialetical behavior therapy and CBT.  These seem to be for the past four months far more effective than the medications.  The medications are a bandaid.  The DBT and CBT are ways you get guided teaching to act and not react and accept who you are for what you are.  Moreover you learn you have choices and you can with the help of a therapist that is well trained in DBT and CBT to survive happily and not kill yourself wit these dangerous drugs.  BTW.  Abilify resulted in a 80lb weight gain in 5 years or so, I became prediabetic, and could not sleep.  When I quit I lost 48 lbs in 5 months.  I only have 32 lbs to go!!! I sleep like a baby now.  I have been in remission from BP I for nearly 9 - 10 years.  After quitting the meds there has been no relapse with the DBT and CBT therapy.  "

Abilify has changed our lives.  She tried other meds (risperdal, trileptal) before Abilify because of insurance reasons and they did not help her.  She takes it along with Lamictal and the combination helps to put her in remission.  She recently was triggered by the unseasonably spring-like weather and an increase in dosage did the trick almost immediately.  She normally takes Abilify 10mg and Lamictal 150mg once daily.  To deal with her current relapse she is now at Abilify 15mg.  I hope that this review can give some other parent hope.  When we were struggling for a year to find the right medications for her, I was desperate to find good reviews among some of the bad ones.  This medication has given us our lives back.  I only hope that she will be able to continue on with it for a long period of time.  As far as side effects go, when she goes through med increases/decreases she may experience painful headaches and overwhelming nausea.  This always passes within a 2-3 days.

My psychiatrist put me on Abilify to quell the attack. I don't remember the dosage. I was also takibng Lithium and Lamictal as the time. It worked well for a while but then I felt emotional numb and had cognitive clouding. I was going through a horrific custody battle for my son and was earning more time with him and I figured this was how things were going to be. I was communicating to my psychiatrist and psychologist that I was having a hard time talking to people and remembering things but my psychiatrist didn't recommend a change for almost a year which of course I was scared to do because I was gaining more time with my son. My psychologist never told me she though my meds were off she just said she thought we could move to meeting once a month as I didn't have much to say! Luckily I told a guy I was dating that I was BP and he did research on Abilify and said it was a nasty drug and that I needed to get off of it. I talked to my psychologist again and she said I think you are having cognitive clouding and that you need to talk to your psychiatrist and have your meds changed. I got off it and I'm a new person. I have emotions and can talk to people again. I've since switched counselors and she said I was probably on too high of a dose and that it's not a bad drug, but for me it robbed a year of my life. Hopefully this will help someone else and you won't have to lose so much time in your life.

However while my symptoms have remained in check, I have had to syop taking it.  While I was on it my triglycerides skyrocketed as did my cholesterol.  Neither were affected levelwise by medications used to treat these physical conditions.  Therefore it became necessary to stop the Abilify.  Within 6 weeks my triglycerides and cholesterol returned to normal with no more need for the meds for theose conditions.  So as a mood stabilizer it was effect, the cost to my physical well being however was to great.

I had got on Abilify 2006. In 2008 my doctor took me off my ADHD medication. All of the sudden I was eating every 2 hours and yes i know that is also from my brain working harder but I could not lose weight I kept gaining. Before I was on Abilify I weight 110. After I weight 125 while on my ADHD medication. Off my medication I weight 160. and for my Height that is over weight. Im 5'4"". I am now off Abilify i have been for a year. I know weight 115. So if you have had a series weight gain I would check too see if it was after you started Abilify. Because most likely its from Abilify. "

The first thing I noticed was I cannot sit still. I'm constantly shifting myself while sitting and fidgeting alot. I also noticed the insomnia. It takes me forever to fall asleep, and when I do, I wake up every few hours. My doctor actually told me that this would help me sleep better. I've also not been able to focus or concentrate... It's hard for me to even do crosswords which I enjoy doing. The worst so far is the ""zoning out"". My boyfriend always thinks something is wrong because I seem out-of-it, spaced out. Driving home tonight I thought my contancts were blurred and I kept trying to make my eyes water, apparently it was blurred vision which is a side effect of the Abilify. I also read alot about people gaining weight. It took me 2yrs to lose 30lbs and I feel great. Now that weight gain is one of the major side effects, I do not want to go through that again. It seems like the cons outweigh the pros in this case. I am debating whether or not to stop taking it."

In 15 years trying all sorts of bi-polar meds, I've never really been stable.  Today, I am stable, don't have mood swings at all, can think clearer and am not depressed or manic.  It has promoted an overall sense of wellbeing.  I no longer have panic attacks either and got off Klonapin.  I feel much more involved in everyday life and my relationships have greatly improved as a result.  I was suicidal before taking Abilify and it has turned me around 180 degrees.  I love life today.

His reactions to other medications led us to try Abilify and to question ADHD as his sole diagnosis. This medicine has been a god send for my son who is 8 years old. 2.5 mg a day of Abilify is all the medication he takes. It has made him more able to interact with other children and form and maintain friendships. He is much less reactive and irritable and is happy at school and doesn't complain about it anymore. The only down side so far is some weight gain. We have to work extra hard to get in plenty of physical activity and make healthy food choices to offset the effects of the medicine. Not the end of the world and so far managable. Things are not perfect but I would say they are 80% better for him on this medication and we are thankful everyday.

After living with severe mood swings for all of my adult life, I was finally diagnosed and prescribed Abilify almost three years ago.  It is like living a different life.  I am practically symptom-free!  I have not had a major manic episode during this time.  My psychiatrist has adjusted my dosage twice during depressive episodes, but overall my moods have been VERY stable!!  I also take .25 mg of Klonopin at night to relieve anxiety and help me sleep.

These 3 drugs combined has been a lifesaver to me & to my family.  I've not had a manic episode since being on this combo of drugs.  The only side effect I've had is weight gain but, I'll take that instead of making myself & family suffer with those horrible maniac episodes I used to have.  I wish my insurance would cover this medicine because it's a lifesaver & also making us poor, very expensive.  But, I'm finially able to enjoy life & to be there for my wife & kids.

I suddently developed diplopia (double vision), followed in a few days by slurred speech and difficulty swallowing. None of this went away with discontinuation of Abilify. Instead it became full blown Myasthenia Gravis. There followed 165 days in the hospital, countless infusions/tranfusions, three surgies to remove thymus to try and get my immune system under control. Many difficult drugs: prednisone 100 mg./imuran 400 mg./ and twelve others, Many addition side effects. I am lucky to be alive three years later. But lost my business and asset base.

For me, it wasn't very effective and it gave me the ""shakes."" I even had a respected neurologist diagnose me with Parkinson's. After going off the drug for a month, went back to the neurologist who then said I didn't have Parkinson's (because the hand shaking decreased)but had essential tremor-a slight shake that is difficult, but harmless. I notice it most when I'm trying to hold something still, like a phone receiver or papers. Still, I went through a month of worrying about having Parkinson's and I didn't have shaky hands before Abilify. Try this med cautiously. It might work for you, but it was bad for me."

Increased mania, high fever, muscle aches and stiffness, severe dizziness, prickly, painful sensation over my entire body, every symptom listed under the ""allergic reaction"" warnings basically. I was confused because I was on 10mg for over a year (2010-2011), and did just fine. I have been off the 20mg for 2 days but am still having the ""dizzy spells"" where every 5-10 mins I get that ""headrush"" feeling.

Within the first week on 2mg my melancholic depression dissapeared and my episodes became less mixed.  The only thing is that while my body was getting used to the drug I would feel quite restless in the morning after taking it and that was on 4 mg.  I'm now on 15mg (with very few symptoms) and have little to no side effects whatsoever.  That said, I don't think you should try this drug right away. There are lots of other drugs to try first.  It's just that it's expensive and very powerful(I'm lucky I'm covered). That said, if you try it and it doesn't work for you you shouldn't knock it, because like all drugs it works for some people and doesn't work for others.  It all depends on how your body metabolizes the ingredients.

I was up to 15 mg a day and when I would complain about the weight doc said I was depressed and increased that med.  Switched docs, got off that crap about 5 months ago. Dropped from 200lbs to 160 in that time. I am now having issues with my PTSD and flashbacks/night terrors but my biggest issue was I slept all the time on abilify and I had tardive dyskensia, flat affect, no emotion at all. I couldn't deal with things while on it and have gone through with feeling angry that I did not deal with things as they occurred as it all came flooding back.  On saphris now for about 2 weeks.  Horrible tasting but I see a huge difference. Moods are stable, more outgoing, get things done, etc. Bad thing about saphris is it tastes very bad( sublingual) and my mouth is sore. I take it while in bed cause it knocks me out so quick. But I sleep normal, no night terrors, and I am generally in a decent mood in the morning instead of crabby.  I am a certified peer specialist and a social worker and I know everyone responds differently but I defiantly would not recommend ability unless it's your last resort.  Only plus about it for me was it surpressed all the childhood trauma memories and I am working on that now.

It like other newer anti-psychotics might bring about a clearer sense of conscious awareness; but for me the side effects are so aggravating and difficult to handle that another anti-psychotic with less side effects, was well worth making the switch. I now take Seroquel XR 200mg nightly. All anti-psychotic meds can cause weight gain and I've just about been prescribed everyone of them at different intervals. Having bipolar 1 disorder which in my case the manic stage is more prevalent does not allow for meds that would be prescribed for depression(i.e. Prozac, Zoloft, etc.). "" Different strokes for different folks"" is the bottom line in all medicinal treatments! June 2012 will mark 40 years of known dealing with manic-depression and even longer with anxiety issues; I'm 54 now. There's always hope; don't give up. It's the sign of a Champion to keep on keeping on. I wish I could have been of more help to whomever reads this. Have a great day!            "

It's a great drug for the prescriber, it cuts down on your phone calls to him. I am so glad, I took myself off it and all other chemical straitjackets. It robs you of your soul. Your cognitive function suffers tremendously, but you don't realize it unless you have to function at a high level and deal with complex problems. It's touted as the only atypical that doesn't cause weight gain, not true! It's just another me too drug in a poorly understood class of pharmaceuticals. Yes it has a better side effect profile than Haldol. If your doctor suggests an antipsychotic for you, maybe you should ask him why he thinks you need an antipsychotic. Short term therapy maybe 2-3 days of Zyprexa are enough to take care of crisis situations. Taking this drug routinely is like taking chemo to prevent cancer. Don't think of this as a mood stabilizer. I predict it will be off the market in 8 years. Educate yourself on this class of medication, be an informed consumer. Oh yeah, I'm a pharmacist too with 34 years of experience. Is this pill really worth $600/ month. That's 3 hours of good therapy you could be getting instead. Big Pharma at it again !"

I CAN NO LONGER DRIVE OR GO OUT BY MYSELF. THIS MEDICINE HAS REALLY DONE A NUMBER ON ME & I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TAKING IT. IT HAS TURNED MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN.

Really, this was very bad experience for me and i kept calling the dr. but he had no time for me.   finally he put me on seroquel, (i was gaining weight by leaps and bounds now) and i tried to shoot myself in the head.  Was put in the psych ward by the police.  I was doing fine until the DEA got involved and pulled all the xanax from the drs who were prescribing it.  Thank you gov.

Read on the internet in britain medical journal, that blood clots have been a side effect of this drug along with other antipsychotic drugs especially seroquel. I had a lot of neck pain.

I'm so productive now, I finally feel like my old (good) normal self. I see things in a much more positive way. I'm really shocked how quickly and well this drug is working for me. Just a note, tried 15mg and felt too sluggish. 10mg worked better for me.

My sister and I are both bipolar.  Having gone through the various mood stabilizers and see her reactions to mood stabilizers, I can tell you that there isn't a single med that works the same for everyone.  So my advice would be to try as many meds as you can giving each atleast 4 weeks to get the full effect then decide which has the least bad side effects.  For me, its abilify.  Granted I went from 120 to 170 and I eat healthy and got a Y membership but cant get the weight off, but I'm sooo much more of a pleasant stable person now than I have ever been.

But, if i get angry i will be raging/ furiously angry. Throw things, curse profusely, break things. Besides that I am able to better handle my sad sad life. Unemployed, in debt for school, home alone all day. This drug has made me more productive. I take Desyrel to help me sleep so I do not get restless. I take it at night to minimize effects of wanting to eat everything in sight. Hope this drug works. I want to add Wellbutrin however. I need a bit more stimulation and happinesss... :/

I also developed such a bad sinus infection that my lymph nodes all the way from the back of my neck into my head are infected- causes much pain.  My primary care physician wants me off this medicine ASAP. I find it difficult to get an emergency appt. with my prescribing ARNP.  Abilify has been effective in stopping racing thoughts; however, the side effects are dangerous and I am stopping the medicine.  I read on the ""side effects"" list that acute sinus infections and rapid heartbeat are severe symptoms.  I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone who is sensitive to medications.

The shaking and tremors I already get from lithium got worse. I felt jittery and tired at the same time (not good when you really need/want to sleep). I think the worse side effects are the weakness and feeling like it's hard to catch my breath. So this morning I didn't take it and it's only been around 5 hours but I am feeling a difference. So my next appointment with my psychiatrist I'm going to ask for something different to address the issues with my Bi-polar disorder/Borderline Personality Disorder that haven't been addressed with my other meds (Lithium, Paxil, Lamictal. I'm also on Trazadone but that's for sleep.) 

I'm not going to say I don't recommend this as someone else might have a different experience because it did indeed help my symptoms but the side effects just were not worth it.

Abilify has been the best so far, and helps me fight away the bipolar so I can function and live my life.

Side effects have been neck and jaw pain. Took cogentin for it until it went away. Pain was quite bad at one point, but the benefits of clear thinking far outweighed that pain."

I have terrible joint and muscle pain from the Abilify. It blows my mind how bad it can be at times, along with neuropathic numbness and tingling at times. I was managing my BP1 with cognitive behavioral tools and xanax for episodic agitation, because I didn't want to be on any kind of daily head meds, but after a manic epidsode that went on for days and days and crashed into full blown psychosis, I crawled back to my Doc horrified and willing to do whatever it took to never ever feel that way again. All around, Abilify has made me feel GENTLE. There is no other way to describe it. I feel easy-going, compassionate, hopeful... but also utterly undriven. My house has gone to hell, and I'm just not bothered. I have a disabling writers block (this is how I make my living, peeps), and I just feel like, oh well... it'll clear up. I have no sense of urgency.  I'm kind and loving and patient with everyone in my life, but I can't deal with the constant physical pain and the total lack of give-a-sh*t. When I have stopped taking it for a few days to ""just see,"" the physical pain resolves, and I'm able to feel angry again, but I feel like the crazy rages are out there waiting for me. My blood sugar is through the roof, so I can't see worth a damn and I'm peeing all the time. I love feeling so fearless and gentle, but I don't think I can stay on this wonder drug. The physical side effects are too great.  I could deal with the lack of motivation, but I can't change the physical issues.  Such a shame."

This led to instability in work and living space, as well as relationships and health.  I decided to go back on meds, and take 1500 depakote ER at night for racing thoughts and hypomania.  But it made me depressed and I still felt overwhelmed and anxious.

Abilify gave me the worst side effects, but I am thrilled with it.  I take 10mg in the morning.  Nothing has worked as well on my mixed-state depression without making me a total zombie.  All other anti psychotics and anti anxieties I've tried either haven't been helpful enough or have zonked me out so I can't work.  This one made me very sick, I threw up for a few days and got chills and aggitated states.  But after sticking it out, I feel calmer and better and clearer than I have in my whole life.

If you have issues with mixed states, don't write this one off because it sounds scary or the side effects are bad.  I would definitely say its at least worth considering!  I am really really glad I went with my gut feeling and tried this medicine despite its bad reputation."

After taking 3 dosed of abilify his jaw began to clinch so tightly I could hear his teeth grinding together and he couldnt stop. Then all of a sudden his mouth opened very wide and he couldnt close it. His tongue actually twisted inside of his mouth and he had no control over it. He couldnt speak during this but said later that the pain and spasms in his jaw muscles were terrible. He was in extreme physical and emotional distress. When I took him to the E.R. they said he had a dystonic reaction to the abilify, which is in the phenothiazipine family of meds. He was told to never take anything in that family again. After a heavy dose of benadryl in an i.v. He acted like nothing ever happened..Im glad it works so well for some people, but it looks like its back to the drawing board for us. It was such a bad experience that he really doesnt want to take anything at this point. Some people are just very sensitive to certain meds. He had a very strange reation several years ago after starting resperdol where his head turned all the way to the right side and he couldnt move it..same deal, we went to the ER, Got Benadryl, and he was fine...Hopefully one day we can can find something that will work for him without the reaction.

She also prescribed this medication without seeing my son in her office. My son had a bad reaction to the drug this evening and it almost caused him to have seizures. His body move uncontrolably, face, arms, legs, every where. His eyes were rolling in the back of his head and he was in a tramendous amount of pain. These side affects can become permenant. The ER doctor this evening told me to stop this medication. So if your child is under the age of 10 I highly recommend that you do not give this medication, it is very hard on your heart to watch your child go through what I watched mine go through tonight!

The effects of this medicine for me are varied.  Currently on 5 mg, thinking about going up to 10 or 20 mg.  I'll start with the cons first: I’ve gained about 40-50 pounds eating the same amount of food I've been eating for years, I sleep for 10-14 hours a night, it hasn't stopped my depression, I'm less talkative to my significant other, I'm more stir-crazy than normal (I have jittery legs, feel some tension in my calves and shin), I lose my balance once in a while, my memory seems to be effected (more short term), I get hot much easier than normal (notwithstanding I live in AZ), I get little joy our of sex and masturbation, it's difficult to become happy, and I'm more apathetic than I was when I was manic and unmedicated.  The pros are as follow: manic episodes are much rarer, I'm able to control my emotions (when I have them) more than I could, and I've not cut myself for the time I've been taking this medication.  Honestly, there are a lot of cons to this medication, at least in my experience, even though I'm thinking about going to a higher dose because it seems like I'm building up a tolerance.  I still have outbursts at work and home, albeit much lessened (like I'll get pissed off at an incompetent client and will start swearing like a sailor once they're off the phone).  I still get overwhelmed by life, though not as much as before, though I find it hard to become motivated as well.  I guess I'll move to a higher dose, hopefully I don't keep gaining weight (and yes I go to the gym 3-4 days a week).  I don't think I'd really recommend this medication without trying something else first or without taking something else in conjunction to alleviate these negative side effects.  Granted, I'm just one person, however these side effects are pretty serious to me.  I'm like a slug now, with very little personality.  Moreover, I still have racing thoughts and suicidal impulses.  Those haven't gone away.

It helps my moods from cycling as much or as dramatically as they once did.  I have also noticed that Abilify helps rid me of some depressive symptoms.  Most importantly, it helps with some severe anxiety I have, associated with the case of Bipolar I that I have.  Several of my symptoms were gone within two weeks of starting Abilify, which was a pretty dramatic and much needed change!  I may have gained some weight while taking Abilify, but it could also be attributed to lifestyle or other medications.  I also know that my body ""can't handle"" a higher dose than 10 mgs or I get mild tremors.  Overall though, the positive effects definitely outweigh the negative.   "

I must take mine in the AM as it works as a definite ""pick me up"".  It has really helped with my treatment resistant depression and my paranoia that the seroquel was not quite addressing fully.  Also no more audible hallucinations for the moment either.  I am sleeping better at night and getting up at a decent hour and actually feel like being productive.  I hope it continues :-)"

I've ben bipolar for most of my adult life.  In the past I have been on Paxil, Lexapro, and Cymbalta. The first two worked ok, but only for my depression, and the Cymbalta gave me really bad Manix episodes. The Abilify smooths everything together. It's been 3 months or so and I'm on 5mg I'm really looking to have it increaded, cause it does not seem to be working as well as it was.  The only bad thing baout it is that when I first started taking it I was told to take it at 6pm and it made me a upset stomach, so i have to take it right before i go to bed.

At 16 our son was diagnosed as Bipolar and began taking Trileptal. At the age of 17 Abilify was added. After taking Abilify along with Trileptal and Concerta for several months the dosage of Abilify was increased from 5mg to 10mg.  Sadly within 36 hours (Friday pm to Sunday am) he committed suicide.   After the tragedy had occurred two people came forward to tell us that he had complained that his medication was making him feel unstable. In retrospect we recall that there was a noticeable increase in volatility within just 24 hours.  The event that triggered suicide occurred 36 hours after the increase, when he wrecked his car.  When he arrived home after wrecking his car it was apparent that he was not himself. He was extremely agitated and irrational and within 10 minutes had taken his life.  Although we were taken aback by the increase in mood swings, we did not associate his behavior with the increase of his medication.  I believe this tragedy may have been avoided if the Dr. prescribing this med had clearly informed us of the warning signs associated with the increase in dosage.  When we notified the Dr. of the tragedy his response was shock and disbelief.  He stated that he believed our son was ""doing so well"".  It seems apparent to me that the doctor had become comfortable in his Dr/Patient relationship with our son and therefore may have minimized the warnings and risks associated with Abilify when taken by teens. My intention is not to place blame but rather to highlight the need for better communication between Dr's and both patients and parents.  Warning signs and side effects should be clearly stated each time there is a change/increase regardless of the length of time the patient has been taking the medication.  "

Was all the way to max at 30mg and had symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, sent to see neurologist twice, then lowered to 20mg, then at 10mg where I have been stable at for over 3y with little reoccurance of manic swings, voices, hallucinations or depressive suicidal idealation, ect.  Also take Prozac, Colodipine, and Remeron to make my strange cocktail......  took almost 1y to figure correct amount.

Each day I feel more like the person I once was. Knowing I am bipolar, Dr. put me on Zoloft, and only Zoloft alone. No mood stabilizer or anything. I feel into the worst case of depression. Finally, I was put on this drug and Depakote, and I'm feeling great. I've been on this combination of meds for about one month. Getting used to Abilify was a challenge. I felt very manic. Couldn't sit still, had to move my feet and legs, and couldn't sleep at night. I was put on  med to help temporarily with sleeping problems. Now that I'm sleeping, and the meds were increased, I'm doing better, for now. Everyone needs to remember, being bipolar isn't a choice. It take alot of tries to get the correct meds, but hang in there. You will be strong, and will be back to the things that you once loved.

My psychiatrist apparently did read the manufactor's prescribing instructions.  I could not afford this medication at one point in time.  10 days later,  akathisia set in.  Akathisia is one gigantic horror experience.  Then I contacted the physician explained my symptoms, for which he never ever mentioned akathisia.  This guy is nothing more than cruel.  At the second to last visit, I was complaining about not being able to get off this drug.  He replied in a very LOUD VOICE, ""Oh, for God's sake, you're not even on a therapeutic dose!""  Iwas stunned.  Why would doctor prescribe a non-therapeutic dose?  I think I have Bipolar II not 1.  Last session, he bowed his head, using a humble voice said, ""I think you are right to get off Abilify.  After all,  tardive dyskinisia could have been growing, becoming more permanent.""  I have been diagnosed with permanent tardive dyskinisia and akathisia by a neurologist.  Why is it that the sheriff doesn't simply make an arrest as other criminals?  I left a voice mail for him saying, ""Have you ever heard of a word, akathisia, just google it and then you will know the definition.  Then do you mind sending information to my home address, please?""  No response.  He took 2 months to send my records to my primary care doctor when it was suppose to take 3 days according to his office staff.  There is much more to my story but my advice is NEVER, NEVER EVER TRUST ANY HEATH CARE PROVIDER FOR ANY REASON!  DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND GET A 2ND OPINION.

I stopped taking it, and continued with the lithium and saw/felt no difference at all. After I could no longer pay for the Rx, I was without meds, and to this day (this was over a year ago) I am worse than ever, I am very quick to get angry, and I say things to those I love without thinking prior to, and I think and mumble things to myself that are even worse. I am unclear if this is due to the meds, but I am leaning towards yes. Zyprexa worked well as a child, but I gained a ton og weight. I have been on more meds than I can count since I could remember, and thats the biggest issue, misdiagnosis, and the effects of the wrong Rx. Be careful when deciding."

It actually brought on a serious manic attack when used as a mania prohibitor. My expierence included a massive mania attack, blindness, hallucinations, and the such. Normally I have an extremely high tolerance for all levels of prescription medications, but in this case I would recommend caution and awareness when using to treat bipolar mania..

I had memory loss, fear of driving.  speech problems, inability to show any emotions. Zoning out. Weight gain.  Walking problems. Insomnia which was one of the biggest problems. I was physically exhausted and mentally drained.  Problems showering and doing makeup and hair. Unable to cook and clean. Unable to work. Loss of interest in anything I had ever liked to do. All of these problems almost cost me my marriage of 31 years!  I went off of it and felt an instant relief from most of these problems.  I was able to walk and talk better, no longer had insomnia, the fear of driving went away, I have lost a pound a week for the last 3 months since discontinuing it.  I am now working again.  I no longer zone out. I am cooking, cleaning, able to get out of bed and get ready for work without a problem. Able to express myself. Able to cry and show emotions. Interacting with my friends and family for the first time in two and a half years. No longer moping around. Not dreading to face another day. I seriously thought I was a broken person and something was very wrong with me. I am in counseling now and am on Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Trazadone, and Lamictal.  All of these drugs work together like a cocktail as my doctor put it.  I am in no way healed of course but am on the road to recovery.  Finally!!

It has helped manage my mania that is caused by my depression and bipolar disorder.  I had to be off of it for several months due to switching jobs and not having insurance right away (the price without insurance is nearly $1000 a month) and there were two main things I noticed.  A. When you stop taking it, after several days you will experience a bit of withdrawal.  It was mostly just some shaking with my hands, nothing horrible. B. My mania came back after a couple of weeks and those several months without it were horrible."

After all the side effects state ""weight gain"", not ""weight gain only if u overeat"". I am a fit 45 year old women , never been overweight and I don't overeat. As a matter of fact I was very cautious what I ate while on abilify because I was aware of that side effect. While on abilify I was packing on weight at a shocking rate. It was making me more depressed because of the extra weight that I am not used to. I stopped taking it because of this issue. So it may work for depression but I don't trust what else can pop up in the future because of it . No Thanks abilify I'm trying something else that doesn't slow ur metabolism and I wont get obesity and sugar diabetes from it!!   "

At 30 mg, it helps maintain my mood swings, while also keeping the paranoia and auditory hallucinations down.  I have noticed weight gain with this drug, however, most psychotropics will cause this (so I've just learned to cope with it).  Abilify is an expensive medication, but I find it quite effective and well worth the money.  I don't believe that this drug is right for everyone, but any who experiences bipolar with either manic or mixed episodes where they may relapse into a state of psychosis, should consider this med.  It's a wonderful antipsychotic and mood stabilizer.

If the purpose of this was to make me physically depressed without the mental symptoms of depression, then it worked. Once I figured out that my sleeplessness, nightmares, lack of motivation, overeating, alcohol craving, apathy was how I feel when I get depressed, I REALLY got depressed mentally too. I think these are side effects of this medication. They are reminders to me of being depressed. If you feel like that when you are depressed you might want to pay careful attention to how you are feeling and check your weight at least once per week. I gained 2 inches around my waist in 45 days.

I fired the Doctor, found one who knows what he's doing & got off Abilify. Now, 3 1/2 years later I STILL have Tardive Dyskinesia & it affects me daily. I'm glad it seems to help some people, but PLEASE BE CAREFUL!
When I was on Abilify I had MANY other side-effects (panic attacks, agoraphobia, problems maintaining my body temperature, skin infections, hair loss, forgetting how to do things, OCD/hoarding, and more, even an autoimmune disorder that has since gone away), thankfully most of those have gone away completely (except the weight gain, skin infections, & while the hoarding tendency is better, it's still there), or at least have become tolerable, but the continuing muscle problems are very frustrating & debilitating to say the least! On a GOOD day I might be able to walk 2 blocks without trouble, on a bad day 10 feet can be a huge struggle.
Abilify also caused my personality to change & I'm still trying to learn how to overcome that (I had a friend who won't speak to me now because of it).
Now that I've been off Abilify I've realized that it was magnifying my moodswings.
I am now on a totally natural/vitamin-based treatment program & I'm doing MUCH BETTER than I ever did on antipsychotics!
PLEASE, if you notice ANY muscle problems, or ANYTHING else UNUSUAL FOR YOU, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, talk to your Doctor immediately! And if they won't listen & take it seriously FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR!!!"

I have been on Lamictal for 2 years during the holiday season and get very depressed my doctor asked me to try this in addition to my Lamictal (on 400mg a day).  I have seen a rapid improvement since I have been on this medication.  So far I have not gained any weight that I have noticed.  I was started on 5 mg but I had to cut it to 2.5 for the 1st two days then I moved up to 5mg.  Today is my 1st day on 10mg.  I feel a little more jittery today but it should ease off by tomorrow.  I will have to warn ....i have been spending a lot of money.  You have to watch yourself but my house and laundry have never been finished at the same time. Awesome.

Up and down multiple times daily. In and out of hospital, day treatment school for over a year.  Started Abilify end of July while in hospital, felt nauseated for 3 days, then completely amazing.  I have my son back for the first time in years!  He is more revved up than ""normal"", is I believe in a mild manic state, always (still) obsessing about one thing or another, very busy, busy, busy, but happy, not aggressive.  Furniture isn't flying across the room, knives aren't grabbed and directed at himself or others anymore and the suicide talk has disappeared.  He started public school today!  Very satisfied with this med.  Tried Depakote, Lamictal, Buspirone, Risperadol, Seroquel, Wellbutrin, Celexa, Ritalin, Adderall, Strattera, and 4 others that I cannot remember the names to.  Is now on Abilify, Buspirone, and Luvox combo....LOVE IT.  Hope other kids can get as great of a benefit as my son.  Good luck and parents...don't let others tell you what's NOT wrong with your children."

1310$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$7/23/2009 2:04:32 PM$Reviewer: Deb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I know that I have only started taking abilify one dose, but I can already tell a difference.  I was diagnosed as bipolar I in November 08 at the age of 48.  After taking pretty much everything except lithium, I was FAIRLY stable taking 125mg lamictal and .50mg clonazepam with 5mg ambien to sleep.  However, I kept getting more and more hypomanic, with hypersexual tendencies.  My psych added 2.5mg abilify yesterday when I told her I was getting no better, only worse.  The only thing I have noticed today is some drowsiness.  I am to increase dosage to 5mg in 4 days.  If it has adverse side effects I will drop back down to 2.5mg.  After so many months of feeling totally not normal, it is very very refreshing to feel pretty much like I used to feel before the bp diagnosis.  I have gained weight before starting the abilify, about 15 lbs., but I needed it.  I could not eat or sleep for so many months when taking all the other meds that I looked horrible.  I do not need to gain anymore, however, so I am going to do my best to keep the eating under control.  My hope, and my docs, is if the abilify works, to get rid of the lamictal totally and only use the clonopin as needed.  That would be SO wonderful.  Taking all these different drugs when you are already ""messed up in the head"" is a nightmare.  I have very little depression with the bp, so I cannot speak for the effects on that, but my mania seems to be less today than since over a year ago. I will keep posting here on progress."

He has gained about 20lbs. I've noticed a big change in his manic episodes,not lasting as long as before. He has also been perscribed Namenda (for Alzheimer's),he is able to think more clearly. Is anyone else giving this to their child?

1667$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$7/26/2008 11:56:41 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$The only thing I hate about this drug is that it makes me hungry. I'm on 5mg of it and it really has helped me. In my diet I am including my high fiber so I do not get constipated. It is still hard to go to the bathroom. I am taking it in conjuction with Cymbalta 60mg. And my husband says I'm a changed person. I do sweat profusely though. I hate that part. But it the benefits out weigh the side effects I think I should stay with it. and Just watch what I eat.
1691$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$7/6/2008 8:19:09 PM$Reviewer: shooting stars, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$4$I have a terrible problem with  what I call nerves they say anxiety. For the last 12 years I've taken clonazepam, and they just took me off it. The last 2 months have been hell. I wasn't weened off it. The Abilify doesnt really help with the shaking or nervous tension I feel inside.They(dr.s) say I have the depressed side of bipolar. I don't know I think I want to check into accupuncture. Too many years of Dr.s and different medications that don't appear to do any thing for me. I've only been on the abilify for 1 week, I know its still new to me and I'm hoping it will kick in an start to help me.
1706$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$6/16/2008 5:48:07 PM$Reviewer: josh, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$5$"Im assuming that medications work differently for everyone but my son had a very severe reaction to abilify. We switched from seroquel after it stopped working and kept pushing him into manic states. Also, he had severe stomache issues.
Anyhow, after one dosage of abilify, my son was violently ill. He bcame a zombie with his eyes rolled to the back of his head. He vomited for the next week, and started to become dystonic (VERY serious reaction)It took a week and seveal trips to the emergency room and Dr to get him back to square one. This medication was truly frightening.  BEWARE!!!"

Before we were walking on eggshells and now he is much clamer so the whole house is.. He has not gained any weight and our sex life is better. He isn't flying off the handle anymore.
1751$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$3/18/2008 12:39:15 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$Though I only took this drug for about a week I still had a bad experience with it.  I had a lot of trouble sleeping and I felt very restless.  My concentration hadn't improved but thats probably because I was only on it for a week.  According to my doctor this could have been due to the fact that I am very sensitive to the drug and the dosage was too high.  Right now I'm in the process of either getting on a different drug or lowering the dose.  Don't be afraid to take this drug just because of my experience though.  Everyone reacts differently to each drug so just because I didn't feel ok on this drug doesn't mean you won't.

1792$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$2/5/2008 12:28:46 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$2$I took this medicine a few years back to treat my depression. At first it seemed to be working ok then I started getting horrible tremors all the time to the point where you could see my whole body shaking across the room. At this point my doctor thought that the medicine was still doing some good and put me on medication for parkinsons dieses to try to get rid of the tremers. This didn't work and about a week later I began to become very angry and paranoid so they switched to a new medication.
1812$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$12/16/2007 5:56:57 PM$Reviewer: $5$3$5$This medication makes me very tired.  I had to switch to taking it at night.  It has worked well but it also makes me feel very restless.

My blood sugar is affected in a negative way with Abilify.  Plus I have gained weight since on Abilify.  The later, I don't know if it is due to my taking Insulin or the combination of Abilify and Effexor XR.  Until late, my mania has been controlled well.
