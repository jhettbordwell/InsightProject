2$Bipolar Depression$12/9/2019 12:43:38 PM$Reviewer: I Need A Vacation, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$3$I've been on this for 5 days now and all I want to do is sleep. Have a difficult time getting out of bed in the morning. I don't feel depressed but I'm still agitated with everything.  I feel like I'm in a fog and cant think clearly.  I started out with 50mg until last night and now I'm on 100mg.  Still feel groggy and I've noticed that I can't talk without stumbling.  I think I'm going to call my doctor and request a different drug.  I just don't feel right on this. Have a dry mouth and throat, tired, head fog, agitated feeling, dizzy and just overall not feeling well. In the past the drugs that worked the best didn't make me feel like this at all.  They worked great from the start but eventually stopped working which is why I'm on this one.  Need a replacement.

That was too strong for me. Now using 50 mg and find the effect is soothing. I don't notice many side effects. I take several meds so I often have dry mouth.

At first it was awesome, my moods stabilized almost immediately;about 6 mo. ago I started gaining weight, feeling listless, too much sleep and most recently more ups and downs. my dr. keeps telling me this is normal and I should just go on a diet and start exercing to keep my weight down; almost impossible when you just can't find the ambision to do so; I also have high blood pressure and high cholesterol since taking it so now i'm on med's for that too...my moods are starting to become more down than up so the dr. told me to go see a therapist. I've been seeing therapists for 5 yrs. now and they are all the same; not interested in going back to one; i'll just live with this and hope for the best

23$Bipolar Depression$8/23/2016 5:27:36 PM$Reviewer: I feel good, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$3$Started taking 200mg along with Lamectal. Within 20 minutes I was so tired I could hardly talk. I no longer had high/low but I felt like a zombie-no emotions at all, always tired and dragging, no desire to do anything. Decreased to 100mg and felt emotionally better but still had a hard time completing tasks. Here it is 7 years later with a new doctor. After learning more about the side effects I decided I had had enough. We made a plan to get off quetiapine- SLOWLY to prevent a manic/depressive episode. It took 6 months and I am totally off it. I had to retrain myself to fall asleep drug-free but I did it. I feel 100% better! My head's not foggy, I have energy, projects are actually getting completed. This does not feel like the manic highs I've experienced before. I just feel good. Like a new lease on life. Do your research and talk with your doctor before taking this drug.
26$Bipolar Depression$6/21/2016 11:49:05 AM$Reviewer: Average New York Professional, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$"I'm at the two-week point. And while it's still a bit painful to get out of bed, once I do I no longer feel ""stoned."" There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

Days one through five were as follows: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg.  Then it was a matter of getting my body acclimated to 400 mg, which I thought would never happen. 

If you are able to take vacation/sick days/medical leave, I do suggest it. I did not. Either way, just know it does get better within a matter of weeks. "

104$Bipolar Depression$5/9/2009 7:41:00 PM$Reviewer: feelbetter, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$Read til happy ending: The first 3 weeks on Seroquel was a roller-coaster nightmare with severe leg twitches, increase in irritability one day then worst depression the next, with an increase in suicidal thoughts too.  Sleep was heavy. But then there was a good day here and there. After 4 weeks, every day was a successful, functioning day with a more positive outlook from the deep depression. I take 150mg at 6pm and began Pristiq 50mg (changed from Lexapro) at 6am in morning. Six weeks in now and I feel like myself and have only experienced light moments of sadness. I'm amazed how much has changed and how fortunate I feel as a result of the meds.

It helps with sleep and dreams and some aggitation but i still battle with Bipolar 1 Disorder. For the most part i would reccomend it to others. It is a good drug.

I went to a clinic and was taken off all the above.  I spent three weeks rapid cycling with psychotic features and devestating depressions and suicidality.  Within a week of starting Seroquel  my symptoms disappeared and have not returned in two years.  The possible side effects are frightening but nothing compares with the hell I lived with for nearly 20 years

I barely made it to 300 mg. I guess you cant be bipolar if you're in a coma! I had weird dreams and slept 12  hours. When I was awake, I ate everything in sight. I had difficulties driving to work because I was extremely exhausted and veered a little of the road. I stopped taking it when I almost wrecked. I will try any medication, but this one, again.

I have no life left since I started taking Seroquel. I am lazy, lazy, lazy!  Not to mention that I've gained 75 pounds on this awful med. because it makes you crave sweets and all carbs like crazy!

Make sure you read all possible side effects because there are a lot and some are pretty serious! I cut my dose in half to 50mg because 100mg was way too strong. I have to take it no later than 11pm or i am exhausted the whole next day. So far I have had no side effects from the drug. I take it in combination with Lamictal 300mg and lexapro 20mg in the morning and xanax as needed. This medication has worked great for me. It helps me sleep well and I am noticably more calm. I haven't had to take my xanax nearly as much. It has lowered my anxiety and i have had no severe mood swings or huge breakdowns since i have started it. I have had no weight gain or change in appetite. It is important you have blood work done regularly as it can change cholesterol levels and white blood cell count.

In the beginning it was fantastic. Helped my depression alot. But after a few months it started to change. My memory deteriorated very rapidly. I was always confused and lost slight motor skills, talking proper sentences and hand eye coordination became difficult. I became so scared. I didn't feel pain or happiness. I was completely numb like a robot. Sleeping days at a time. Forgetting shifts at work falling asleep everywhere I sat down. I had to get off I feared it was going to kill me. 
I tapered to 50mg then 25mg over about 2 months. I'm completely off now for about 3-4 weeks. Instantly my memory became clearer. Side effects at the beginning were extreme irratibility, anger and constant migraine. Few weeks later I am now getting severe nausea, worse migraine, extreme anxiety/panic attacks, always so thirsty, insomnia, very sensitive to light and I feel like I'm losing touch with reality. Hard to explain although worst experience of my life. This drug should ONLY be prescribed for extreme life or death cases. Or banned. It's disgusting. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  "

210$Bipolar Depression$5/25/2016 9:48:08 PM$Reviewer: QuestionPrescripDrugs, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$5$I have been off this medication for years now. But I used it for 2.5 years from ages 15-17. It was horrible, but I was also misdiagnosed with Bipolar. It made me tired, cranky, nauseous and unable to eat for a month at a time, gave me headaches, and made me dizzy. There were plenty of times when I consumed huge amounts of alcohol and pot with Seroquel, which was never a good experience. Don't ever do it! Please. I was originally put on 400 mg and they upped it to 800mg gradually, (when you're first put on the drug, you feel drunk for about a week).I finally had enough and stopped using it cold turkey. I had physical withdrawal for three months - similar to a heroin withdrawal (from what I've read in relation to my symptoms). The drug increased my heart rate astronomically - I was seeing stars quite a bit. It made me crave unhealthy foods which didn't help, and made me gain unhealthy weight. Before you go on this drug, seriously contemplate whether you actually need it. And NEVER mix it with another substance. As a healthcare worker, I would NEVER put a teenager on this drug, unless they had severe schizophrenic symptoms. I started to develop facial twitches after awhile and slurred speech. It took a couple years and major lifestyle changes until all of these effects completely dissipated. The only thing I appreciated about Seroquel was its ability to put me to sleep, and keep me asleep, as I have a hard time staying asleep throughout the night. However, it caused me to have many bouts of sleep paralysis.

I can only explain it as ""Restless ass and mouth syndrome"". I was doing wind sprints in my back yard just to shake off the uncontrollable urge to move. Not only that it made me want to eat the butt off a cow and talk nonstop. I could not sleep and didn't feel it did much to treat my depression. I ended up stopping it before my month was up because the side effects were not worth taking anymore even if there was a potential light at the end of the tunnel. That being said everyone is different and I know people that take Seroquel and it's helped them immensely so really it all boils down to the individual."

Like others say, it does knock you on your backside. With that said, it has been almost four years since my last inpatient treatment and I can live with that. I've gotten used to the side affects which for me are mostly the comatose feeling. I take it at bedtime and it helps me to sleep then ""wears off"" and I feel much better during the day. I tried MANY others and this is the one that works for me. It's not perfect but it's better than the alternative....."

I see a lot of people talking about 200 mg plus, I can't imagine that.  This medicine along with effexor has worked for my depression but I'm trying to get off of them since I have the worst side effects with weight gain and short term memory loss.  I literally feel like I've smoked a joint every time I take this pill.  For mood swings, it has helped a little, but I feel like a healthy life style is what has been best for me in the past.  Healthy eating and exercise can work miracles.  When I was drinking and partying and not working a lot it was depressing and that made me lose it a little.  So I have been on this med since 2009 bbut I have also still struggled with sobriety completely.

I have been taking this drug since 2001 without noticeable side effects and it has put my condition in remission!
I had problems sleeping prior to taking this medication. I now sleep about 8 hours/night. I do wake up feeling a little sleepy, but this passes quickly and I am able to go about my day.

272$Bipolar Depression$1/8/2015 7:38:52 PM$Reviewer: ThinkingMonkey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I was prescribed 300mg of Seroquel several years ago by my psychiatrist for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I was also taking about 8 others. Didn't help much and as many of you may have experienced with it, I had a massive weight gain and slept like 20 hours a day. I normally weigh around 200 but was at 260 after about 2 1/2 months(!). I told her I wasn't taking it anymore, it wasn't helping and it had those very severe eating and sleeping side effects. Well, fast forward about 6 years and 2 psychiatrist later and now the new doctor decides Seroquel is a really good idea, 900mg at that, triple what had messed me up so bad earlier. I told her I wasn't taking it but she insisted I at least try it. Lo and behold I felt like a new man and I had no sleeping or eating side effects whatsoever! I couldn't believe it. So I've been taking that dosage for about 3 years now and it works pretty well. The combination of medicine I now take, quite a bit of it, does seem to hinge on my 3mg daily of Ativan though. If I miss a couple of doses it seems to throw EVERYTHING out of whack. None of the other medications seem to work right anymore. So I guess this review is pretty worthless because what I'm saying from personal experience is that Seroquel is horrible and you gain 30 pounds a month and sleep all day and night, but later experience with it proved to work pretty darn good. I would say 'great' but I don't think any medication works 'great', except for Nexium, that is. :)
274$Bipolar Depression$12/20/2014 5:16:57 AM$Reviewer: jess, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$"I started my journey with Seroquel 200mg and Lamictal 25mg after a year long battle of emotional problems, depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts without the help of medications. Immediately after I took my prescribed meds back in Oct 2013, they stopped my suicidal thoughts and overactive thoughts, just at the right time before I decide to do anything rash. My Seroquel doses was altered, at various times, I was on 100mg, 150mg and 200mg. 

The most common side effects were drowsiness, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache and stuffy nose. The worrying one is nose bleed. It made my nostrils so dry it bled when I picked them for a little. 

Overall, I like the medication even though it made me feel like a zombie. I regain stability almost immediately after treatment. There were fluctuating mood episodes - one stressing depressive episode lasting 2-3 weeks - but other than that, things were pretty much fine. After around7 months of treatment, I started seeing a clinical psychologist for therapy and hoping  I can make long lasting changes in my relationships with people.  "

I wake up feeling drugged and this lasts for hours. I have no interest in living much, no social life, no drive. Interesting because I completed a 4-year degree recently. Seroquel sucks and I am dizzy all of the time, I've fallen down at work. My doctor doesn't want to hear it, so I turn to webmd to give my bad review. One day I'll make it, off all of the meds, and will deal with my life and my mood on my own, instead of being told I need a heavy, toxic, soul-killing drug in my body to be 'normal' boring and dead inside all the time.

I take 200 mg before bed and sleep pretty well. At first, I did have some vivid and anxious dreams but that tapered off after time.  If I still have trouble staying asleep I can take .5 mg Xanax and the combination usually puts me in a restful sleep.  No hangover effect for me.  No ill effects at all, really.  I also take 200 mg Lamictal along with 150 mg Wellbutrin  and most days about .5 mg of Adderall in the morning.  Then another 100 Lamictal at night.  After decades of ""spinning the wheel of antidepressants"", this combo finally has yielded a very positive result.  No more highs and lows.  A great deal more focus, energy, concentration and drive.  Helped me end my love affair with alcohol too...no serious anxiety or worries to hide from. Everything seems a lot less complicated and easier to deal with.  It's not that my life is without problems, it's just a lot easier to assess, address, and handle things.  I have actually lost weight probably due to the Adderall.  As far as my dosage, I could keep adjusting up or down on any of these, but I'm pretty happy with what I've got going now...don't want to upset the apple cart here.

It was prescribed for me initially by a pill pushing shrink who made a snap judgement that I was bipolar II after my wife filed for divorce and I asked for help.  I had been on and off anti-depressants for years, usually after failed relationships.  It made things worse, not better, and I ended up in and out of the psych ward six times over the next three years, and each time they increased the dose, finally to  a staggering 900 mg per day, also prescribing high doses of Lamictal, Abilify, Effexor and Clonazepam, at  which point I became a zombie and was unable to function for nearly two years.  I also gained the standard 80 lbs.  I'm my experience this drug and the others represent all that is wrong with ""modern"" psychiatry; blindly throwing questionable meds at the problem without an understanding of the underlying brain chemistry.  My salvation from this nightmare came when I got fed up and started seeing a psychiatrist who had the reputation as being one of the best in the business in a large West Coast city.  She carefully listened to my symptoms, my story, and after a few sessions had me tested for the MTHFR genetic mutation, which occurs in various forms in approximately 10% of the population.  Turns out I had two of the mutations which keep the body from processing folic acid, a common vitamin found in many foods, into L-methylfolate, which is needed to balance the common mood regulators, such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, which I am sure many of you know about if you are on this website.  Her solution was to put me on Deplin, a medicinal food ( not a drug!) and wean me off Seroquel and the other drugs, which she felt were either totally useless or in the case of Seroquel did more harm than good.  Within a month I started feeling much better and after four months I was weaned off all of the meds, completely symptom free  This is my story only, but beware Astra Zeneca and the pill pushing incompetent shrinks."

I took the medication at night & it would knock me out for 10 – 12 hours straight.  I gave it a couple months to see if the side effects would lessen.  They didn’t.  So we cut my dosage in half down to 150mg.  I still slept a lot & I could not get moving the next day.  I kept taking the meds thinking things would level out over the next few months.  They didn’t.  The medication did not help my depression at all & on top of that my body felt so drugged.  I was so weak that I could barely take care of every day household chores.  I almost never left my house because I always felt so bad both emotionally & physically.  We cut my dosage down again & a couple months later I still felt horrible.  I WAS A PRISONER IN MY OWN BODY!!  I read that other people gained weight on this medication.  I actually LOST weight.  I have always been thin but while on this medication I started to look like a walking skeleton.  I live alone & I was too weak & tried to even get up to cook.  I was only eating one small meal a day.  It was quite scary watching myself literally withering away.  I finally asked my doctor to get me off Seroquel.  She prescribed Citalopram (generic for Lexapro) and after just two weeks I am starting to feel better & I am eating better also.  I regret wasting almost a year of my life on Seroquel.  I should have gotten off of it sooner.  Live & learn.

Then Lithium was added and I developed neurological symtoms so severe that at first the neurologist thought it was a stroke. Developed hypothyroidism (as I had before on Lithium). Physical Therapy, use of cane, inability to drive, poor speech, reduced cognitive skills were very scary.  Symptoms in remission after 3 months.  Then bouts of akathesia (made my legs feel like the nerves were on the outside, feel you can't sit or stand, severe restlessnes). Weight gain was horrible, and increased as dosage increased. 40 ponds in the last year. Hungry all the time. I was just taken off of the drug two weeks ago and I cannot believe the change in metabolism.  Yes, I have more difficulty sleeping (switched to Trazadone) and racing thoughts are back, but I am determined to deal with those holistically and with DBT. I cannot live in fear of neurological symptoms. Neuroleptic Toxicity and Extrapyramidal Symptoms are no joke. In my experience, it is not worth taking and never in combination with Lithium.

It was recently approved for treating agitation in people with autism, and that is why I take it. Abilify is also approved for that reason, but that made me depressed and fainted so I switched to Seroquel, which is overall a better med for me. It's also great for treating insomnia.

513$Bipolar Depression$9/11/2012 9:05:35 PM$Reviewer: APB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $2$1$3$The effects I was were experiencing were hard to describe, but I was simply put, not myself. I felt innebriated and out of focus. I did not feel safe to drive. I had distinct memory loss and my temper was shorter than normal. And the mood swings were not resolved at all. I stopped taking seroquel and switched to Prozac to address the moodswings. My OBGYN is quite sure I was misdiagnosed and suffer from PMDD as opossed to bipolar II. I have been taking Prozac for 2 months and feel like I have my life back. Another note worth mentioning is that I've never had a weight problem, and at age 40 have been 125-132 since age 20. Within a month of taking seroquel I had gained 15 pounds. It was a very strange experience. Be advised that seroquel is a very serious, mind-altering drug. It felt very dangerous and unnecessary for me, but again, perhaps it was due to a misdiagnosis.

I've been taking it a long time and it works. But it still scates me. I have high blood pressure and thanks to this drug I know it has caused me to have involentary jerking movements as I try to go to sleep. Be careful when you take this medicine as it can cause death.

But it also made me gain 8 pounds in 2 weeks. Mood wise, for me, it didn't do too much difference. If anything, it made me more in a state of depression. I would suggest it to someone who has a difficult time sleeping, but not at high dosage. Also, if your weight is important to you, don't take it.

Out like a light 3 hours after taking it.  And yes, felt like a zombie with no emotions whatsoever.  Been in bed for 5 days now.  Raised my blood sugar and haven't been able to control this at all.

584$Bipolar Depression$3/9/2012 5:50:54 PM$Reviewer: Illmissbacchus, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I was prescribed Seroquel and took it for only 4 days total.  I didn't even think the drug would be effective until it had built up in my system but perhaps it was because I was very malnourished and weak at the time I began to react within 24 hours.  It started a manic episode that literally had me smashing my head against the wall at work.  One co-worker found me lying unresponsive on the couch and thought I was dead, really I was just out-of-my-mind with panic, rage, and silent screams only I could hear.  I decided to take myself off it after that, as rogue librarians are frowned upon.  However, and I don't have any proof that this was a side effect of Seroquel and I'm sure people would argue with me but, for eight months afterwards and very seldom, to a far lesser extend, now I experienced pain in my shoulders and spine as if my skeleton were attempting to escape my body through the base of my neck.  I've eliminated all other culprits and those few days of Seroquel were when the pain began.  'Pain' does not even begin to describe what that felt like though. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially those recovering from illness.

My moods seem to be more even and I get amazing, blissful sleep. My only concern is how dependent I may be on this medication with regards to sleep. Since taking Seroquel, I never have anxiety about not falling asleep, and I am concerned that I may never be able to fall into a peaceful sleep without it. Also, my Husband lost his job recently, so we no longer have medical insurance..when i went to fill my prescription I was informed the cast would be about $800. Luckely I went on line to the makers of Seroqual and found a program that would help me with the cost. It's called AZ&Me. I hope this may help some of you."

It knocked me out and took a while to adjust to. I suppose it has helped with my mania (I seem to only have them when I drink-- not a good idea). Overall I am able to focus, process, and make responsible decisions now. The draw back is the weight gain- which just in the last six months has become noticeable and embarrassing. That alone makes me dislike my self image- but who wouldn't. The worst part for me is knowing that I can never come off of this drug because I ran out several months ago and experienced awful withdrawals. I was so sick and my insides hurt. I felt like I was dying. I never want to experience that again ever. It was terrible. As long as I take the drug daily and do not drink I am fine. I'll have to do something about this 20+ pounds on my tiny frame though. My clothes don't fit! Just do everything you can to not go through the withdrawals. And consider this a warning- you might get stuck taking this forever. Bonus- AZ&Me has patient plans and financial assistance to those who qualify.

One pill per day at bedtime because it also makes me sleep like a baby. I had a lot of problems sleeping and it sometimes took hours for me to fall asleep.  When I first began taking it - it made me sleep for a good 15 hours.  I never heard an alarm and ended up loosing my job because my boss did not believe me. Over a short amount of time the sleeping evened out and I slept the normal 7-8 hours a night. But VERY deeply!! Hope my house doesn't catch on fire because I doubt I would wake up. I still have bad moods but nothing like they were before Seroquel.
731$Bipolar Depression$8/24/2011 11:12:08 AM$Reviewer: Crash85, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$When I was first diagnosed as Bi-Polar approx. 10 years ago, I was put on an SSRI. The SSRI had bad side effects, and I stopped taking. I have tried several different SSRI Anti-Depressants during this 10 year span. Approx. 3 years ago I ended up in a Mental Health Facility, and while in there I saw a psychiatrist. After an assessment the Doctor again diagnosed me as Bi-polar with an added diagnosis of Severe Anxiety w/Panic Attacks, and again tried another SSRI that was fairly new to me at the time called Celexa. I took it for about a month or so until the same side effects I have always had with SSRIs began. So I went to my new doctor and explained this to him. He then prescribed me Seroquel to try as an alternative to an SSRI, at first at a low dosage, than higher as I needed it. Not only did it NOT cause the same unwanted side effects as the SSRIs did, it eased my conditions very well and proved to be extremely effective. It has successfully countered my Bi-Polar Disorder for the last 3 or so years. It also aides with the Severe Anxiety & Panic Attacks (along with Clonazepam). Lastly, I have also been diagnosed as an Insomniac and again Seroquel alone has also conquered that diagnosis as well. All in all, while this medicine is expensive due to the lack of generics (patent hasn't expired) it is well worth the money as I have had multiple disabling problems managed with the use of this one drug. The price of the medication can be adjusted with insurance, and/or a financial plan with the Drug Company themselves who offer RX Discounts, and free medication to those who are in need. The only bad side effects I have experienced with this medication is occasional nightmares, and dry mouth in the morning. I hope this helps anyone thinking of taking this medication. For my situation it was a PERFECT solution, and it may be the answer for you as well. Always talk to your doctor and weigh the pros and cons.

769$Bipolar Depression$6/29/2011 4:56:49 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$4$Seroquel was expensive and no fun at all.  After taking my dose, I would be in between sleep and wakefulness.  I would not be able to sleep, but would be very drowsy and yet restless.  It was a very uncomfortable feeling.  I would lie down and not be able to get comfortable.  The uncomfortable feeling occurred whether I took Seroquel in the morning or at night.  I kept taking it anyway.  I can't say how much it helped and how much was the natural course of my bipolar disorder.  But I would not take it again if I had the choice (and fortunately nobody's asking me to.)  Maybe it will work for you, but not for me.  I haven't taken it in years.  Now I'm on a generic version of Lamictal and a generic version of Risperdal.  Risperdal used to have a similar effect on me, but it doesn't anymore.  Maybe it was my drinking that caused the unpleasant side effects.  Who knows why these drugs work this way?  I sure don't.  But I'm much better without drinking.  I recommend it (quitting drinking).

It did help with my anxiety and depression and with sleeping problems. Its much safer than benzo's, and my body became used to the feeling (I know some antipsychotics make you so sick but this one didnt). One thing though, if you are taking a high dose, it can be scarey waking up the first few times and going about your day. The first night I took it I felt like I had been anesthetized and waking up, I had to really lay down for awhile (try not to fall back asleep), be careful when I got up and walked around, and when I did get up, I ended up having to lay down on the floor before passing out. But if you give this medication time, it can work for you (I know diff meds work for diff people), so just give it about 1-3 months if you can handle it. It does get better/ easier and side effects usually dissapear.

I cannot stand what it has done to my body and intend to have my p-doc remove it come my appt. on the 25th of May. My sleep is so hard that when I awake, it's as though I've not slept at all.

It left me feeling very ""slow"", uninspired (I am an artist and this has been difficult for me).  It immediately relieved the mania, but not the depression; that took quite a bit longer (about six months).  Other strictly anti-depressents were much faster acting relative to depression.  It (the Seroquel) also gave me nausea and a sense of apartness from others.  Maybe that was good, given how difficult a time I was having coping with others in that period,a nd that I had recently been extremely traumatized by an abusive relationship w/a former partner.  I don't think I would recommend this drug for everyone.  I think there are others that may do as well and that the pharmaceutical that manufactures/distributes it allows me to obtain the drug free-of-charge is part of why I THINK it may have been given me, rather than something else.  I don't know.  Prozac and its family caused greater mania (and anger) and, at the end of the day, when I am not exercising and getting enough rest, all my symptoms reappear anyway."

Of course just like any medication it has side effects, however I have found the Positives to outweigh the negatives. Just watch your eating at night time and always set your clock for some extra snooze time. Also you should monitor sugar levels with this medication. But I totaly back this medication 100%!!!!!

Since starting I no longer have suicidal thoughts which used to be a daily thing for me. My anxiety has decreased and I finally am able to go out by myself. I used to be so nervous aboout being alone and what people were thinking when they saw me. Nothing else has been anywhere near as effective as Seroquel. My only complaint is that I take 300 mg XR at bedtime which my doctor instructed me to take at 7pm so I will be able to sleep and get drowsy around 10.

It is only my second night taking it and I can feel myself stabilizing for the first time in years! Yet the over sleeping sucks but being bipolar mixed, I'm used to it! So you just have to accept it and work on yourself! And also weight gain is a big thing with depression too! So really if you get your butt up and be active I am sure you can conquer that, Plus everyone is different. My experience so far is dry mouth and oversleeping.

958$Bipolar Depression$11/11/2010 11:44:44 AM$Reviewer: HappyNow, 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$4$Took about a week to adjust to the medication. At first I saw double and slept like the dead. I would bump into walls after taking it, so I took it right before I went to bed and had no difficulty. I had somewhat of a hangover in the mornings, but that went away after 10 - 15 minutes of being up and about. But I felt better in a few days, better still in a couple of weeks. After a week or two, I adjusted to it and felt no side effects except a little morning hangover. Small price to pay for sanity. This can be a great med for many people. I'm bipolar II, rapid cycling with 3 suicide attempts. It was like magic for me. Ride out the initial side effects.

I was perscribed many different drugs, but this is the ONLY one that works for me.  No more suicide attempts and my moods are much more stable.  It does have some side effects but if you can learn how to work with them, they aren't an issue.  I've never ever been able to sleep at night, but an hour after taking Seroquel, I'm out.  I love it.  It did cause me to gain 30lbs, but once I fought through the cravings, I was fine.  Lost all the extra weight and my diet is back to normal.  Since I take it at night and it knocks me out, I know I need to get at least six hours of sleep or I get the ""hangover"" effect in the morning.  The only thing I don't like about it is that I get ripped from my sleep at least once a night.  Nightmares, but the racing heart is a little scary.  It goes away within a minute or so of me waking.  Then I'm back to sleep without any problems.  I don't mind the nightmares.  It's better then spending weeks at a time in Psychiatric care.  So yeah, I love it.  "

At night my heart rate would increase, and I would feel like I was being dragged into a deep, dark coma against my will.  Sometimes I experienced mild hallucinations, which were frightening.

1084$Bipolar Depression$7/3/2010 7:08:02 AM$Reviewer: Riga, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$4$Seroquel worked wonders once when I was experiencing a consistent feeling of unreality for days. The very next day I began to feel at home in the world, not anxious or depressed.  However, as soon as the drug started to take effect (I took it at night), I would be so dizzy I couldn't walk without holding on to furniture.  I would fall asleep anywhere--on the floor of the closet while looking for something in a box, on the floor on my exercise mat, standing up in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee.  I'd wake up when the coffee spilled or I started to fall (if I was standing up), but I had a horrible experience waking up on the floor of the closet covered in clothing that had fallen on top of me, not being able to remember where I might be--it was pitch black, I was covered in something--was I in hell?  I didn't think I was dead but I was terrified until I crawled out of the closet and realized I was in my bedroom.  My husband would find me sleeping on the floor all over the house.  So, I went down on the dose. Still had side effects (less though)and it didn't work as a sleeping pill for me. Right now I'm trying not to take it until I need it again.  It is a VERY effective drug but side effects are surreal.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started on Seroquel.  Within a week I felt like a different person, constantly in a fog.  And good god, the sleeping...I slept CONSTANTLY.  When I took the first dose, I got up once to use the bathroom, and other than that slept for 30 something hours.  I gave it time for the side effects to wear down and continuously slept for at least 14-16 hours a day until I stopped taking the medication.  Also, I gained over 40 pounds in 4 months while I took it.  I felt hungry constantly.  It helped with my depression and bipolar at first, but after a month or so, what good effects it had wore down.  Before taking this I could've been considered a nymphomaniac (an effect of bipolar, I know), but this medication made me lose ALL interest in sex.  And this has become a long-term problem.

Also, DO NOT GO OFF THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT TAPERING OFF WITH HELP FROM YOUR DOCTOR.  I could no longer afford it, so instead of paying attention and tapering off of it, I just stopped.  I was sick for days.  Felt horrible mentally and threw up constantly.  

This medication may help some but it was absolutely horrible for me.  If you have issues with it, talk to your doctor instead of thinking the effects will go away.  "

Although it did allow me to sleep, when i finally got to sleep, my husband hated it because it made me a zombie (400mg).  The weight gain is OUT OF CONTROL!!!!!

From the beginning it was a horror. Extreme panic attacks mostly. I told me doc about the side-effects. I told her I stopped taking it on my own, she then replied ""I think you need a higher dosage."" So I tried the higher dose and it made the side-effects much worse.

Seroquel gave me my life back.  I can again hold down a challenging job, be an effective parent, and sleep like a baby.

It made me extremely tired at first, but that faded after the first two weeks.  The dreams I experience on this med are amazing.  Very vivid and detailed.

Like others here have mentioned, it makes me crave sweets like there is no tomorrow.  I gained 8 pounds the first month, then realized what was happening and stopped giving into the cravings.

Overall, Seroquel is my own personal miracle drug.  I've seen several people mention that Seroquel has abuse potential.  The only recreational value I can imagine would be to use it as a sleep aid.  "

My blood pressure hovered around 60 over 40.  I kept losing my vision, falling down, heard buzzing or ringing sounds, slurred my speach.

It was terrifying.  

I had taken seroquel for a couple of years before having the acute adverse reaction.  

I also became so sleepy I would sleep for two or three days at a time.  

When I finally stopped taking it I lost 35lbs.  I believe that the medication has very long term effects on my brain.  I haven't taken it in three months now and I still feel foggier and more stupid than I used to be.

My memory seems to be permanently changed.  I cannot remember as well as I used to before taking this drug.

Physicians are prescribing it to large numbers of patients now.  I think there will be a large population of people who are less intelligent than they were prior to taking the drug.

Also, there is no cure for hypotension.  So, if you get it like I did, you are just plain screwed.  Spend time considering these side effects.  I think they may be permanent.

Also had other side effects which made it not worth it. Extreme fatigue in the mornings, cognitive blunting (i.e. felt like I was in early Alzheimers) never realized I don't have a horrible memory until after I stopped the medicine 3 years into it. Now my memory is completely normal!

I was on 400mg/day for just over 2 years, and was also taking 300mg/day of Lamictal.  At first the Seroquel was beneficial, but after a while the side effects began to greatly outweigh the positives.  It was great for putting me to sleep, and though I didn't have too much trouble waking up, I did have problems feeling awake for most of the day.  It also gave me double vision for a couple of hours mid-morning, which obviously made all activities difficult/dangerous.  I also experienced auditory hallucinations, though not intense or alarming.  I truly only noticed them once they were absent after stopping the medication.  The withdrawl was horrible.  I was constantly sick to my stomach, could barely eat, and vomited for over a month.  However, it was worth it!  I still experience mild hypomanic episodes, but not as serious previous to the Seroquel.  I still remain on the Lamictal and it has been a savior.

It worked well, however I felt tired after sleeping 10-12 hours.  I took it for 6 of the 10 years I've been sick.  8 weeks ago I went off Seroquel and started using Abilify and Ambien.  I feel much better and feel rested after only 8 hours of sleep.  I have lost 14 pounds in the last 8 weeks.

I dropped 80 pounds.  But I became extremely depressed and thought about death all the time.  Went back on it five months ago.  I have already gained 60 pounds.

I started having major anxiety and feeling depressed - fear got a hold of me. Sleeping aids didn't work. I started an outpatient pysch treatment program and to my surprise was diagnosed with bipolar II. I started taking Seroquel. 

Now I take 600 mg a night (have been increasing the dosage for almost 2 months). Helps me sleep at night, but that is the only benefit I have experienced. I feel very lethargic when I am awake, and since taking the drug, my mood has not returned to normal. Constipation and dizziness are other negative side effects I experience on this drug. I plan to start reducing my dosage immediately, so I can eventually stop taking it altogether.  "

1378$Bipolar Depression$11/19/2009 9:33:45 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$"I have been on Zoloft for over a year.  This past summer, my doctor added seroquel in addition to the zoloft. We began at 50mg. At first, it seemed to be helping. It did make me very drowsy about an hour after taking it. If I tried to fight it and stay awake, it felt like I was drunk.  Then my moods seemed to get worse.  The doctor gradually increased the dose to 300mg.  In the past 3 months, I have gained almost 30lbs.  Prior to the medication, I was hardly hungry.  Now it seems like I can't get full.  Also began cutting myself when extremely stressed.  Not sure if this was from the seroquel since I don't have a history of cutting.  I found it very difficult to wake in the morning.  I have a 19 month old child and I never hear him cry in the mornings.  It's a good thing my husband is home to hear him. Having a young family, this drug was very difficult to use.  Having to take it pretty much as soon as I got home, to make sure that I would get enough sleep to hear the alarm in the morning.  I needed to have at least 12 hours of sleep.  It's just not possible to spend time with my husband and take care of my child on this medication.  
At this point, my doctor is gradually decreasing the dose and we are going to try ambilify (I think that is how to spell it).  Hopefully, it will work better for me.     "

I was on this drug for a little less than a year, and in that time, I literally could not function. Then, one day, I ended up checking myself in to a pshyciatric ward,  because of the side effects of this medicine. All at once, I could not swallow, followed by severe confusion, muscle rigidness, and psychosis. I WAS TERRIFIED to say the least. I spent two days there and was taken off the drug. After a few weeks, I started to come around and feel halfway normal again. I feel sorry for anyone who is taking this obviously harmful medication, and the fact that this product is still on the market and people are taking it, bothers me. Hope this helps someone out there.

I gained 30 lbs in no time and it was more like water weight because it was more like my whole body was swollen from my face all the way down to my feet....I had no energy at all it was hard to even get up and down out of a chair. I had chest pains constantly,dry mouth and the shakes... I could go on and on because I felt like it was literally killing me !!!! I took myself off of it because I called my Dr and she advised me to stay on it even after I told her about all the side affects I was having and there was noway I was going to do that I know my BODY and I knew I was not feeling right. After going off of it my insomnia is back but I am able to live life again and the weight dropped off without me even having to diet....

1413$Bipolar Depression$10/18/2009 1:46:11 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$"I had a horrible reaction to this drug! I was on it for about 3 weeks. When I got up to the 300mg pill, things started going down hill for me. I still don't remember a lot that happened when I was on the med, and I started cutting again when I was on it, sometimes with no memory of cutting myself. I had bruses from bumping into things all the time, and it was basically like being drunk and high constantly. It was not fun. The first night I took the 300mg pill I wet the bed cause I was so knocked out I couldn't wake up to go to the bathroom. 

I went to the doctors because I had slight whiplash from going to an amusement park (while on the med) and not being able to control my head on the roller coasters. When I was in the room my speach was slirred and when I was walking to the waiting room I had to be guided out, and I've been going to this place for years and could probably draw map of it from memory. The PA, nurse, a woman from the front desk who has known me since I was a baby, and my case worker all stopped me before going in the waiting room and told me that I needed to be off this med, because of the effect it was having on me. A different doctor perscribed it for me, and the PA called him and told him I was to taper off Seroquel right away. Getting off the med probably saved my life."

Despite medication, my illness grew from mild depression to a total inability to function in the '00s. Nothing worked until I was put on Seroquel. Like magic, the negative loop that ran and ran in my mind stopped. Yes, I've gained weight (it does seem to trigger late nite eating) and the restless legs sometimes drive me crazy, but I can function again. I even got a job and have been able to keep it! If this had not worked, my doctor was recommending electric shock therapy, so believe me, I am thrilled.  Having taken so many meds over the years, I am convinced that each individuals brain chemistry or whatever you want to call it is as unique as his or her DNA.  What works for me may not work for you.  Side effects that I can tolerate; you may not be able to stand.  But until my doctor tried Seroquel, I was hopeless.  The only thing that kept me from committing suicide was my dogs and not wanting to leave a mess for my family to clean up, either literally or figuratively. Oh, it is also expensive as hell, but I'd pay for it even if I didn't have insurance.  Hopefully, it will become a generic some day soon. Finally, it does make you sleep and sleep and sleep.  I've just had to adjust my life so I can allow 9-10 hours a day for sleep. It is worth it to me.

Is it Bipolar depression or major depression?  Big differences in the two.  He suggested this medication because I have failed many trials of anti-depressants.  I have been on this medication for 4 months at 300mg.  The first 2 weeks of taking this medication were a blur.  I remember being in a daze, disoriented, dizzy, and very very tired.  Ok, I gave it a few months.  The verdict, I am not impressed with its powers as a depression fighting drug.  On the other hand, I do suffer from sleep apnea and insomnia and it actually helps me fall asleep.  I take it 2 hour before bedtime, and by bedtime I am about to fall over, boy does it make you sedated, but I am no longer tossing and turning for hours before finally falling asleep.  It takes me about 15 to 20 minutes and I am out!  A good sedative for sleeping but not so much a good mood-stabilizer/anti-depressant.

1508$Bipolar Depression$8/11/2009 3:50:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$I've tried a lot of antidepressants over the past few years. All the drugs I've tried either didn't work or worked for a bit before they stopped working. Last week, I went to my doctor to follow-up on the Pristiq I've been taking. I told her that some days it seems to help, but other days it seems like I haven't been taking anything.  I also told her that a month or so ago, I was feeling good so I stopped taking it for about 2 weeks and felt great before I crashed. She said it could be that the drug worked its way out of my system, or it could be that I may be bipolar.  I told her that my therapist has had me tracking my moods, and she thinks I may be hypomanic.  My doctor said most people call the doctor when they are feeling down and think they're depressed, so a lot of the time, bipolar disorder gets overlooked.  She had me fill out a questionnaire, and the results showed borderline bipolar disorder. She suggested trying Seroquel. She gave me a starter pack which starts at 50mg on the first day, increases to 100mg on the second day, and goes up to 200mg on the third day.  My doctor said to take the Seroquel at night because it WILL make me drowsy.  I took my first dose (50mg) on Saturday night and woke up on Sunday in a major daze. My husband kept asking me if I was ok. By late afternoon/early evening, I wasn't in a daze anymore. I took my second dose that night (100mg) and woke up on Monday morning again in a daze. I took the morning off work because I was afraid to drive. It almost felt like I had been drinking. That night I took the third dose (200mg). I woke up today feeling very dazed, although I'm coming out of it now around 3:30. I stayed home from work today and called my doctor to see if this was a normal side effect and to ask whether it'll go away. They called me back and said the doctor is calling in a rx for Abilify instead. I hope that helps. The Seroquel has helped with my racing thoughts, but I don't think the daze I've been in is worth it.

It works really well but it does have many side effects. I gained 50 pounds and I now have Type 2 diabetes. I have to be on Seroquel regardless of the side effects. I cannot sleep without it and I am a basket case if I do not sleep. Seroquel is extremely expensive if you do not have insurance. It costs around $750 for 60 pills a month without insurance. And please if you take Seroquel at night, don't get out of the bed because it will make your heart race, which can be scary. I take them only at night and when you get used to Seroquel it gets easier to function. 
Now, if you start to eat more than usual try stopping by taking a appetite suppressant or try to beat the cravings by eating vegetables. Otherwise, I can't function without Seroquel.

1582$Bipolar Depression$7/1/2009 7:57:25 PM$Reviewer: Rachelle S., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I take a very small dose of Seroquel XR - just 50 mgs - a few hours before bedtime to help with sleep.  I was told this formula (the Seroquel XR) reaches peak levels approx. 4 hours after taking it and have found this to be fairly accurate.  A very important reason that my doctor has me on this drug in addition to Trazodone for slee is it also helps minimize my anxiety and mixed episodes, which is a very good thing!  I was on a higher dose (200 mgs) but found it caused me too much fatigue during the day.  I have had some weight gain with this drug, but that was primarily when I took more, not on this smaller dose.  (The weight gain could also be related to the combination of drugs I take: Depakote XR, Trazodone, Pristiq, Abilify, Klonopin, and Seroquel; so I can't just pin-point it as the Seroquel.)  I did notice that when I first started taking Seroquel it had much more of ""an impact"" at sedating me then it does now.  The smallest dose could tire me out within about half and hour.  This effect has worn out though now.  Overall, I would say Seroquel is a very effective drug for me.  I know several others that take it (for varying reasons and with varying effects on their energy level) so I will say it's very important with this drug - like all prescriptions - to really find out how it will affect your sleep and energy and why it's being prescribed at the particular dose it is being prescribed.

I had terrible side effects. First i gained 40pds. Then i was a zombie the next day and i am a 32 yr old woman with three children. It also raised my triglycerides alot. Normal is under 150 and mine was 609. High triglycerides can cause damage to your pancreatitis and can kill you. I am having a hard time remembering things and i have problems getting my sentences straight. But the worest of it all is i was diagnost with Tardive Dyskinsia which is terrible i now have movements with my mouth and tongue that i can't control. If you look up the side effects on this drug they say its suposely rare to get Tardive Dyskinsia well i guess i was that one in a millon. This drug is terrible i don't reccomend seroquel to anyone. Now on top of taking my normal biplor meds i have to take Niacin for my Triglycerides and 200 iu of vitamin e complex to help control Tardive dyskinsia. My dr told me that Tardive Dyskinsia is sometimes irriversable. Which means i will probaly have to live with it. I would not reccomend seroquel to my worest enemy. Now my dr has slowly taken me off the Serquel and put me on Geodon. Wonderful drug it gives me lots of get up and go and a different out look on life. It opens up your eyes. The only side effect with Geodon is at first its kinda like Seroquel when you get up in the morning its hard to get up an go but my dr gave me Adderall 10mg to take in the morning and i now have know problems. So to all you people out there with Bipolar with panic attacks and aniety DONT TAKE SEROQUEL IT HAS RUINED MY LIFE!!!!

First off it works really, really well for mood stabilization, and if you have insomnia it works really well for that.

IMO, it is the second best, with Zyprexa being the first.

However, here are the problems.  Sleepiness all the time -though not near as bad Zyprexa.

Constant, constant, constant hunger.  Over about four years of taking atypical anti-psychotics.  I went from 190 lbs to 270 lbs.

My doctor took me off of it and put me on Lamictil.  Almost, immediately, I started shedding the pounds.  I take other drugs that suppress appetite, but I will say without a doubt that the Seroquel just simply made me way too hungry, and too fat.

Look if Lamictil did not exist, it is either taking the Seroquel or having to deal with major depression and dizzying highs.  I would opt to take Seroquel."

Is there a chance of addictive qualities with this drug? It worked reallllly well for me for a couple months, but has slowly worn off and isn't worth the side effects.

I been on it for 2 1/2 weeks now.  the first week it helped me sleep now its just making me very lethargic and gloomy, i take 100 mg at night. even tho it is helping my mood swings and anger it doesnt help my insomnia or nightmares. otherwise it is a good med and i rec. it except im afraid of the withdrawl that comes with it :( & the weight gain cuz im taking other meds for PCOS that is helping me lose weight and control my other health issues like my sever insulin.

By taking it at night it helps me fall and stay asleep, and I don't have trouble waking up as long as I get eight hours of sleep. This med has caused me to gain 15lbs. but I'd rather have a few extra pounds than live the way I used to when I was flipping out and being angry all the time. I used to get crying spells before I took Seroquel, and those are gone too. I also talk to people more freely and a lot of my social phobia has gone away. I feel like this medication saved my life by making me comfortable in my own skin and helping get rid of all the unnecessary rage.

The only thing this drug does for me is put me to sleep. I haven't noticed any kind of change in my mood or behavior. Another bad thing about this drug is, it makes you extremely lethargic the next day. I take 150 mg at night with a small meal. It hasn't helped.It seems as though my moods are getting worse. I wouldn't recommend this drug.

It did NOTHING to help me sleep - in fact, I started taking it in the AM with my other meds to help me remember.  I started having the weirdest muscles movements as I was falling asleep though.  My leg muscles would twitch, my hands would fly out from under my pillow, and I would donkey-kick my husband, apologizing even as I was kicking him.  This has stopped since my Dr. took me off the meds, but I'm scared they'll come back permanently, and I'm terrified of the weight gain issue.

When I was 15 I attempted suicide for the first time, I was sent to a mental facility where they diagnosed me for Bipolar and put me on Seroquel and Lithium. I gained a lot of weight off from the Seroquel, and it messed with my head a lot. After I took it I felt extremely lethargic and sleepy. I didn't sleep well, I'd often scream in my sleep and wake myself and everyone around me. The drug made me more confused than anything else, I didn't feel as sad as I did before, but I also couldn't feel happy (unless I was over tired from taking it), it was like I was numb. Nine months later I had a second suicide attempt, I was sent to a different mental health hospital and they replaced my medications with Lexapro, Wellbutrin and Topamax (mostly to help my weight situation). I just got off all my medications last spring, so it's been almost a year now that I've been medication and therapy free. Althought Seroquel can actually treat people, I don't really recommend it for most.

If I don't get 10 hours of sleep I can barely function the next day. If I do get the 10 hours then I feel ok. The thought and mood control is great but the zombie/hung over feeling isn't. I'm thinking about stopping because it is beginning to affect my focus at work.

I am trying to lose weight through diet and exercise with minimal loss (1 pound in 1 month of hard exercise and following weight watcher's diligently)  I find the exhaustion I initially experienced went away, but is now back again.

My Dr at the time put me on 200mg a day, and even though I wasn't feeling better, he kept it at that.  In the long run, he ended up up being a terrible Dr, so of course I switched.  My current Dr is awesome, and has me on Seroquel, Klonopin, and Lamictal.  I ended up spending a week in a psychiatric unit with severe anxiety and panic, about 6 months ago, before I was on my current treatment regimen.  After all of that, and during my stay in the hospital, my final dosage is at 600mg per day (50mg morning, 50mg afternoon, 500mg bedtime).  It has worked very well for me, both with my anxiety and my moods.  I haven't had a bipolar cycle in a long time, so in my opinion, Seroquel is an all-around wonder drug! :)

At least while your awake. And then there's the whole can cause Diabetes thing. The only thing this drug should be used for is to treat manic episodes that can not be controlled or possibly dealt with by other means. Try sleeping pills when your manic and have been awake for 20 hrs. Strict sleeping schedules are a must for all mental health.

This medication has not helped me at all with any of my issues, in fact, it has made me feel like a zombie throughout the entire day.  I also find that it makes me extremely sleepy so I am not sure why she has prescribed this medication twice a day.  I’ve spoken to her numerous times about this issue because it is affecting me staying awake at my job which is not a great thing.  I’ve also been experiencing extreme abdominal pain to the point where I could hardly stand up straight.  At first I thought it was gas which causes bloating and pressure but then I found out it was because of this medication.

I honestly don’t recommend this to anyone due to the ineffectiveness of the product and because it will make you feel like a zombie for at least 99% of your day.  Before I took this medication I actually felt better so I am now at the point of lowering my own dose by cutting my pills in half each day and eventually I will stop taking this medication and seek out a naturopathic or holistic route.

I feel that doctors today will prescribe medications to patients without being totally honest about what other products are out there, so we must do our own research.  I have come to the conclusion that doing your own research and finding a doctor who wholeheartedly cares about your well being and is interested and/or willing to try alternatives before giving meds that will make your life “less productive” can make the difference in solving the problem or having a medical condition that can affect you for the rest of your life.

1869$Bipolar Depression$12/28/2008 6:04:49 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19 and now I am 22. I have been on several medications to help my condition but I think seroquel has helped me the most. It helps me sleep (which is sooo important). It also helps my mood tremendously in that I don't think about how I'm feeling- I just feel rested and... better. So, if you just started taking this or are thinking about it for depression, anxiety, etc. I say give it a chance. :)

I take 200 mg of seroquel and 600 mg of lithium. My moods swings have leveled off, the vioces and shadows I had are gone. i sleep all night now, it is hard to get up the morning though, I gained about 20 pounds but I was that much underweight, my eyes got very dry, but no other side effects. It's been much easier to stay sober since I started taking seroquel and lithium.
1880$Bipolar Depression$12/16/2008 10:03:22 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking Seroquel for about a year and a half.  I started at 25mg. That did nothing.  I am now up to 400mg. I do like how it helps stablize my moods. I have depression, and bipolar.  I take the seroquel as a stablizer and Wellbutrin XL for my depression. I have been gaining alot of weight since this last bump up from 300 to 400mg. I gained about 15lbs in the last 3 months. I used to have a horrible time sleeping. This knocks me out like a baby. The downfall is if I take it really late at night and have to get up really early for work or something, I get really sick. Light headed, dizzy, sweating, feeling like I'm going to throw up and even pass out. I moved about 2 hrs from my psychiatrist and she wouldn't give me enough medicine to make it to my next appointment, and wouldn't call it in either, so the withdraw from it is terrible. I get bad migrains, sick to my stomach, dizzy, and just plain mean. I do want to talk to my Dr about maybe coming off of it. I hear alot of people have been gettin diabetes from it, and that runs in my family. I don't want to do anything that would help it along.

I am 36 years old and have been bi-polar since I was a teenager and started taking meds when I was in my 20's I also have schizo trates.  Over the years I have taken every med that is out there on the market and some would work for a little while and then stop working. I have had horrible side effects everything from weight gain, body trimmers so bad I could not stop slobbering and hold a cup of coffee, liver damage, high cholesteral, I can't tell you all the side effects that I have had.
I started seeing a new doc and she suggested that we try seroquel and I was at my wits end because I did not want to end up back in the mental hospital I just wanted something that was going to work.  I started taking it and everyone said they could see a difference in me that was for the good I was like my old happy self again.  I have been able to stop taking the anti depesants and the sleeping pills and the anti anxity pills. This drug has made a world of differance for my life I am able to get up and do things, be with my family and friends and I am happy.  Not all days are good mind you I still have some times where the anger comes out so I think I might need to increase the dose but all in all this drug has been a life saver for me."

as far as my condition goes... i havent felt like cutting, killing, hurting myself at all and much more even with my moods"

He was givin this drug years ago and we thought it was wonderful. Unfortunatly he was also an alcholic and they knew this when they told him to take 200mg a day. The said it would help him get his thoughts straight and enable him to stay sober. My brother died Feb. of 2007 from accidental perscription overdose. He had been drinking and taking this med. and it finally built up so much in his system that his heart stopped. He was 45 yrs. old with 2 kids. This medication may be a blessing for some but PLEASE take every precaution to monitor yourself on this. And don't drink!!!

It's done a good job of leveling my mood and keeping me from blowing up with anger like I used to. I haven't been as depressed and paranoid since using this medication. The only down side I've experianced so far is that it makes me feel very drugged and loopy. I have a hard time working my body and want to fall asleep so I take it at bed time. I would not suggest driving while taking this medication until you are used to it's side effects. I've heard about weight gain associated with this medicine, but have not experianced it thus far. I'm on 100 mgs at night and am working my way up to 200 a night and 50 to 100 mgs as needed throughtout the day, although I don't usually need the extra 50 to 100 mgs.

I don't have the weight gain and it's the best night sleep ever! I have accidentally skipped a dose or two and couldn't sleep for a couple of days (50+hrs). I fall asleep fast and stay put for 9+ hrs. I did have a hard time at first w/waking but now I am learning to take it earlier (which is difficult, I work 2nd shift), and get up earlier.  I tend to stay awake the rest of the day as well.  No tiredness through out the day.  But if I take it and I am not in bed, I do tend to feel a bit ""drunk"". I did my homework a bit before taking.  I knew a lot of people said something about weight gain. So knowing that before hand, I curbed my normal eating habits and changed them into healthier choices.  I have increased my activity level as well.  All in all I have lost 12 lbs.  My moods have leveled.  I am a bit more organized. And I am trying to be a bit more hands on with my kids (ages 16 & 11).  I also picked up a hobby which normally I would never do.  I will write back if I have  down side, or an episode. I hope you found this helpful and I hope it helps you see a different side to this medication.  Good Luck."

In a 1-2 wk. period (while in hospital) they brought her up to the full dose. (A psychiatrist at a good teaching hospital later told us the dose should have been built up to over a 3-5 month time span). When she went back to high school, she had what they call Word Loss where she would raise her hand to give her interpretation of a poem and she would have trouble expressing what she meant to say and it was very embarrassing for her. She almost got in an argument with the teacher and she is not the type to do that.

It took my new doctor a while to find the right dosing for me. The lower the dose, the more I would sleep. The higher the dose the better normal sleep I have had. My depression and self esteem and life control is much better. It took many psychiatrists to finally figure it out. None of them completely understood all the past meds I was on and the weight gain I experienced on all of them. The uncontrolled movements with all the other drugs. With this drug he told me first few weeks I would feel sedated, but that it would pass. Told me to ONLY take it at night couple of hours before bed, watch my diet, eat better as most drugs have you gain weight.

That night was the FIRST night I slept more than 2 hours total in 14 months! I actually slept for 10 hours, and I rested, not just closed my eyes. I had been going, non stop, for 4 and 5 days in a row with a max of 4 hours of sleep TOTAL! It has been a life saver for me! I did find out the hard way, though, don't take seroquel and codeine at the same time... I took a teaspoon of cough syrup with codeine when I was sick and my pulse was BOUNDING and at 155bpm for over 3 hours. I fell asleep convinced I was not going to wake up. MY husband sat up and checked my pulse constantly for HOURS... It finally came down to 110 after 6 hours. NEVER AGAIN!!! I was given 100mg to take but I MUST have 12 hours to devote to sleeping if I take that much.  I get by with 8 hours with taking 50mg. It seriously saved my life, and my marriage...

I have tried to take it daily, and while it does help me sleep, I am still groggy the next morning.  In fact,  I am on the lowest dosage, 25mg.  I recently went back to the dr and he has also prescribed Lexapro for anxiety and Xanax to take while I am at work.  While I do feel that Seroquel has helped me this last year, it is difficult for me to take it daily because of the sleep and grogginess.

It worked for the first week, then lost it's effectiveness.  Dosage was upped and I gained 45 pounds in three weeks.  It then took two months to get me off of the stuff.  It's horrible.  The withdrawals even at a low dose are equal to opiate withdrawal.  There are much better and safer medications out there that aren't as expensive as this drug.  With my insurance paying 80% it was still $150 per month.  Astounding.  There is also a class action lawsuit being filed against the company because it causes diabetes from the weight gain."

2264$Bipolar Depression$4/2/2008 3:27:40 PM$Reviewer: Nay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I was diagnosed with Bipolar II in August 2008. I had severe aggravation, anxiety, couldn't relax, insomnia, irrated easily, most of the time isolated and couldn't work to boot. I went to a psychiatric nurse practioner and she started putting me on Lamictal and klonapin for sleep. After two times trying Seroquel, the second time was the better. I think the Lamictal had to balance my mood first and my body got used to that way of functioning, more calm. My sleep is much better, can sleep through the night at 50mg at bedtime. I feel so relaxed during the day and more confident I can get through my days. Not inhaling alot to relax. No weight gain yet, but I am excercising regularly and eating right. Please don't give up on medications as Seroquel might be helpful especially with sleep. You,ll know right away with the sleep. I know we are all different and we all need different dosages or meds. but it's nice to know that Seroquel works fast for sleep and in my case three days to see the calmness. I have read so many reviews, and thank you to all who have helped me find Seroquel with yuor inspiring stories.

2288$Bipolar Depression$3/17/2008 9:12:47 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was on 300 mg for bipolar/anxiety/sleep but I was still very anxious.  My doctor told me to do 450mg.  I did that for a couple weeks but then my doctor thought the Seroquel was adding to the anxiousness so he took me off it completely.  That was a huge mistake.  I did not sleep until he put me back on it.  I was also more anxious again.  When he put me back on it mainly for sleep he told me to take 300mg and if that didn't help to take another 300mg.  This drug has helped me in many ways.  It is very sedating so I only take it at night.  I sleep very soundly, too.  My husband will come home from work at midnight and we will have a conversation.  I won't remember a word of it the next day.  This is a side effect that I am more than willing to live with, though.

I used to be a trim size four but as a result of the medication and the increase in appetite, I am now a size ten. Though it does help me sleep, it sometimes make me feel dizzy and nauseaus. If I happen to get up in the middle of the night, I bump into things. Recently while getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, I hit my head,but I was so groggy I didn't realize I had hurt myself. 

My vision has blurred, I sometimes get pain in my body when I'm sleeping and I wake up in the morning feeling sluggish and drugged. On some days I have such a hard time shaking the fogginess off that I am completely withdrawn.
Additonally it has made me severely constipated.
 Also with the weight gain, I'm extremely concerned about becoming diabetic. My mother was bi-polar too and she became diabetic from her medication-a year after acquiring diabetes she passed away. It's extremely frusterating to have to choose between your mental health and your physical well being. I'm sure that seraquel works fine for some, but it is not a medication I would recommend."

I'm newly diagnosed as bi-polar and this is the first treatment we tried because of I've also PTSD nightmares/flashbacks. I have to say I actually sleep now, of course, but after the first week of taking the med I'm not drowsy during the day and I feel stable. I've had one panic attack in two weeks, two ""manic"" episodes in a month lasting less than a day each, and my depressive days have been cut dramatically! If you're looking for a miricle drug, there isn't one. This isn't for everyone. It can't work for everyone-- nothing can. It sucks, get over it. But I'd recommend trying it to any one with bipolar or PTSD with the caution to take a week off and adjust fully to the new med.

Also makes you gain a great amount of weight and none of the doctors will admit it is the Seroquel doing it. 
You will sleep walk and just pass out in random places. Talk and scream in your sleep.

2480$Bipolar Depression$11/14/2007 5:40:21 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Took my first dosage (25 mg) at 9 p.m.  Awoke at 7 a.m. the next day, feeling very groggy, slightly nauseous & sensitive to light.  I lost consciousness about 7 minutes after waking up, likely due to a drop in blood pressure.  The fall resulted in serious injuries (cuts and bruises) and a concussion, and a trip to the ER.  I would advise starting treatment on a day you can devote to assessing how you react.  I personally was advised by ER Doc to discontinue.

I've been taking Seroquel for about 8 years and have had no side effects, not even the weight gain. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I still get some depression (mania is completely calmed) and because as much as I love that it helps me sleep, I work nights and can't always get 8 hours so I am a bit groggy for the first few hours I'm up.

Five years later, my dosage doesn't work to help me sleep but twelve hours later I still can't get out of bed. It makes me feel DEPRESSED! I am so unmotivated to do anything and yes I get the late night munchies even though I'm almost falling down the stairs to get food because I'm groggy. I'm determined to wean myself off this drug. I think its good for a short term, but not long term. I tried cold turkey and I felt like I was dying for well over a month. I went back to half a dose. Sometimes if I haven't slept I take a whole dose. It's been months and that's as far as I've gotten. I don't know how long it will take me to finally get off of it. But I want off. Even at half a dose I have more energy than I have in the last five years combined. I feel like I belong as a participant rather than a bedside observer!

This med works great for the intended purpose...helps control my moods, helps me sleep better, I'm not suicidal anymore, and I find myself having more energy.  What I do not like, however, it that it has caused major weight gain! I have gone from weighing an acceptable (my opinion!) 120lbs to an absolutely horrible 140 lbs in a matter of one short month!!  I am only 5'4"", and although the medicine is definitely working for what it is supposed to, I find that I am getting depressed again over the weight gain issue, therefore cancelling out the benefits of the drug.  I have decided, after weighing myself today in the store at 142 lbs, that I have to stop talking this drug.  It will not do me any good if I keep gaining weight because I am becoming more depressed, therefore suicidal, because I consider myself fat and can't loose weight and I am hating myself.  For me the drug is not worth the side effects.  For someone who is not concerned about their weight it could be a miracle drug!"
2618$Bipolar Depression$8/5/2014 4:40:10 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$3$"I have been taking Seroquel nightly for 2+ years.

PROS: I sleep much better, my mood is more stable, and I rarely enter into manic periods. I am almost a functioning human being again.

CONS: (1) I feel groggy for about 12-13 hours after taking any dose (25-150 mgs), which makes mornings feel nearly impossible, and has caused me to miss several important appointments. (2) About an hour after taking Seroquel I ALWAYS get insane munchies, worse than anything I ever felt smoking/ingesting pot, and then I get very drowsy. MIDNIGHT MUNCHIES + 12 HOURS SLEEP x SEVERAL MONTHS = SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT GAIN. (3) If I don't take my Seroquel, I don't sleep, and over time I have developed a tolerance for Seroquel, so I have to take increased quantities for it to be effective. (4) Recently my blood tests indicated that my liver is damaged, and my new doctor wants to start hunting around for alternatives to Seroquel, but I am reluctant."

I could barely walk one house.  After having cataract surgery in both eyes, developing sugar diabetes, and so sleepy day and night, I changed my diet am walking 1 mile a day, and after two years have lost 150 lbs.  I can only eat around 1000 calories a day and was only eating 800 calories a day to begin weight loss.  If I eat bread I can gain 3-4 lbs in a day.  I am glad I'm not been depressed for a very long time, but can't stand the day time sleepiness.  My doctor has gradually gotten down to 150 mg. and am still as sleepy as can be.  The trade offs have been worth it up until now, but I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.  Don't know how low I can go and still get the good affects of keeping my moods stable.

The first two weeks I felt so much better and could sleep better. However, I soon found that I was sleeping all of the time and my mood just got worse. I was a straight A student who always paid attention in class and I turned into a student who rarely went to school and was always sleeping. I began to have horrible nightmares that I would sometimes wake up panting and terrified. I'm normally a hard worker but on this medicine I was disinterested in everything that came up. My health greatly declined while on this medicine both physically and mentally. When I couldn't take my medicine for a week after leaving it at an aunts, with in a few days I was a wake and alert and much happier. The only thing that happened was I was extremely itchy.

I took the medication at night & it would knock me out for 10 – 12 hours straight.  I gave it a couple months to see if the side effects would lessen.  They didn’t.  So we cut my dosage in half down to 150mg.  I still slept a lot & I could not get moving the next day.  I kept taking the meds thinking things would level out over the next few months.  They didn’t.  The medication did not help my depression at all & on top of that my body felt so drugged.  I was so weak that I could barely take care of every day household chores.  I almost never left my house because I always felt so bad both emotionally & physically.  We cut my dosage down again & a couple months later I still felt horrible.  I WAS A PRISONER IN MY OWN BODY!!  I read that other people gained weight on this medication.  I actually LOST weight.  I have always been thin but while on this medication I started to look like a walking skeleton.  I live alone & I was too weak & tried to even get up to cook.  I was only eating one small meal a day.  It was quite scary watching myself literally withering away.  I finally asked my doctor to get me off Seroquel.  She prescribed Citalopram (generic for Lexapro) and after just two weeks I am starting to feel better & I am eating better also.  I regret wasting almost a year of my life on Seroquel.  I should have gotten off of it sooner.  Live & learn.

  After 2 or 3 years I began feeling disillusioned about life. I had gained some extra 80 pounds. I didn't really expect this but it probably was worth it because it saved my life.

I feel a lot calmer and not so agitated BUT in a matter of two weeks I have noticed how I can't stop eating, I am constantly hungry, I am beginning to gain weight and I can't barely fit into my pants anymore. I decided as much as I want to feel better, I cannot afford to gain weight like this so I am going to contact my doctor immediately and figure out what to do. It's a shame cuz I like the way this medicine makes me feel but I am already overweight and do not want to become terribly obese.

I started taking seroquel at the tender age of 13 after a series of medication trials and failures. It has at the very least kept me from going off the deep end.. I do know that when I haven't been able to afford the $478 (and rising all the time) for a 30 day supply of 150mg daily I feel the effects of not having it- i get depressed, cannot focus at all, angry at everything, fidgety, restless- cannot sleep at night at all. When I'm on it I mostly feel foggy, my memory has declined significantly since taking it (no other reason sticks out as to why). It has contributed to many small failures in my professional life, but I know I wouldn't be alive to hold a job without SOME meds. I take in conjunction with Wellbutrin- it has been a good combo for me, but no cure all. I've had weight gain, tremors, constant constipation.. I cannot keep focused enough to finish sentences in many cases and it's extremely embarrassing to look like a fool like that. I would recommend this medication to those who haven't and need to try something because it's been better than nothing and it has generally contributed to a better quality of life for me. Now if only I could rid myself of the life sentence that is bipolar disorder. I really worry about the long term effects (diabetes is probably not fun)."

Fortunately, I've been able to get off of it. This drug caused intense, scary visual and auditory hallucinations, nightmares, significant weight gain, increase in mammary size, and anti-social tendencies. Before you freak out about my credibility, prior to becoming bipolar, I was a practicing psychologist, family therapist, a university professor, (Psych) and socially well-adjusted. I am also taking, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Lorazepan, and Temazapan. In the last two weeks, I quit smoking, and quit Seroquel. The hallucinations have stopped, the voices have stopped and I feel more at ease. The medical model of mental health is really a no-win situation. One brief example that reminded me of the frustration of long-term self-medication; I had a bone spur on my elbow and waited 2 months before seeing my family doctor, I didn't want to take any additional medication. Well, I had it bass-ackwards. After 3 DAYS! on Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory, my elbow stopped hurting. After 3 YEARS on the aforementioned meds, I still get depressed. All the literature states that these meds will restore the ""deficiency"" of neurotransmitters and encourages you to keep on taking them. Well, where's the cure? Look at the  list to the left, there's 25 meds for depression. How did the neurotransmitters become depleted, that's my question. I am beginning to realize that being depressed is depressing. Maybe we should allow ourselves to feel anxiety in manageable doses and work through it, instead of sedating our more painful emotions. That's what I'm going to try. Wish me luck. Peace. MK-ULTRA"

It has made me more confident in my interaction with others. On occasion I feel my speech is slurred and just have to compose myself and actively speak clearly. It has also helped with intrusive thoughts (uncomfortable thoughts I could not get out of my head). I enjoy the peace of mind seroquel has brought me.

The weight gain is starting... 7 lbs so far.  I should be able to manage it by keeping tabs on my diet.  The increase in prolactin has given me larger breasts.  Occasional feeling of numbness on top of my hands and forearms.  I'm more relaxed, patient, less quick to anger, feeling fairly stable.

My daughter tells me to say that Im pregnant, which Im not but thats how big I got, I was 130-135, so you can see how this is affecting me. Oh and the shakes, I have to use two hands to be able to have a cup of coffee, when I eat my hand shakes so bad that half my food falls off the fork. If I bend over my legs shake so bad I am afraid of falling, so I have to sit down. So the shakes are so bad that its like having Parkinsons Disease. I have discussed this with my Dr, and he upped the dose to 400 mg. As one of the other reviews said, may as well crawl in a hole and wait for some miracle to come along.

Low Dosage 1x/day: 7.5mg 30 days, 15mg 30 days, 25mg 30 days then 37.5mg 30 days.

Can not take it at bed time, I'm awake 3 to 5 hrs.  Started taking in the morning with Lamotrigine 200mg 1x/day.

Just realized this time of day will not work for me. I nod out sitting on the toilet or when I'm on my computer after the 3 to 5 hrs has passed.

Will start taking with my dinner meal and see how it works.

Effectiveness - wow!  Disabling depression is in the past.

Started to have ""desire"" again to get out, enjoy, do things of interest and even get more focused.  Main thing is just having feelings again.

Low ratings for ease of use is due to figuring out the timing of when to use this med. Thus, little bit lower satisfaction.

Recommend this if you're able to handle all the drowsiness!

I was diagnosed with Bipolar1. I use it for depression, mania, mixed episodes, and rapid cycling. My doses have ranged from 1000mg's to 1800mg's. I am currently taking 1400mg's to be stable. I know that's a very high dose but that's what works for me. I am quite happy happy with Seroquel. I'm a small person, I am 5 feet tall and I weigh 107 pounds. So not everyone gains weight from seroquel.  I also do take lamictal and topamax as mood stablizers, and klonopin. I take the last 3 not only because of the bipolar disease, I also have a seizure disorder. If your Dr. ever suggests that you give seroquel a try, I would seriously consider trying it and see if it works for you!

These are hard to fight-off the sleepiness but can be taken at times when sleep is needed and only other times when agitated, etc. Seroquel will actually cause you to become agitated if someone pushes you in any way while on them. I find that they work best when alone, needing sleep, or in depression episodes where sleep may be desired instead of further depression or anxiety. I can function on Seroquel, as long as I don't take over 100mg.

I constantly feel bloated and very uncomfortable. I have tried everything to remedy this. So I have decided to find something else.

But I have been back on it for about a year, and though it has been my best friend at night (it WILL knock you out!) it has been a double-edged sword.  Exactly 30 minutes after I take it, I am suddenly FAMISHED! This stuff makes you eat everything in sight, and as a result, I have become ""fluffy."" Put it this way - I weighed a whopping 90 lbs when I graduated high school in 98, and I have since more than DOUBLED that. I have gained around 40 of that just in the past year and a half!

I am fully functional thanks to this medicine: attending work, spending time with friends and family, maintaining a healthy romantic relationship, and volunteering in my community. That said: this drug is NOT for everyone, and you should try drugs like Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor etc before you try this drug because the side-effects can be horrible. My side effects are dry-mouth, severe drowsiness and akathesia, a painful panic=like attack that can cause me to walk around my apartment in circles for an hour or two after I take the drug. Luckily, my doctor and I found Mirapex, an anti-Parkinson's drug, to stop these panic episodes from occurring. I take a significant dose of Mirapex before bed, when I take Seroquel, and also usually smoke a small amount of marijuana, and this has allowed me to enjoy the benefits of Seroquel without the horrible panic. If you have akathesia as a side-effect, and the drug is helping you, please try Mirapex before you give up! 

Finally, please note that every story in this thread is one person's personal experience - including mine! - and none of these stories are an accurate portrayal of what you will experience yourself if you try this drug. I mean this as both a warning and an encouragement; only you and your doctor can decide if this drug is right for you, and I hope our stories make you more informed in this decision. God bless."

Great concentration and creativity. At higher doses it turns into a nightmare,hyperness,trouble sleeping,wierd thoughts.I have tried many different drugs none worked as well but this drug by far is the most dose sensitive of anything i have taken. Less is more and i wish they made it in 5mg tabs. Im tired of cutting 25mg tabs. I also take 100mgs of lithium and 0.5 mgs of clonazapam daily.I am at my best with my small but regular dose of seroquil.Want to learn how to know if your taking too much or not enough of your meds? Drink alot of water every day. if you feel better after the water, slightly reduce your dose. If you feel worse after alot of water, increase dose.this works with all meds.Dont keep taking anything that doesnt help you,switch to another drug or docter. NEVER EVER QUIT ANYTHING COLD TURKEY.Switch or gradually reduce.

The worst and only problem with the drug is the uncontrollable earge to eat excessively shortly after taking it. As well as the pattern of sleep that is so deep and requires about 10hrs a day, I feel it isn't safe to sleep so deep when on one occurence the building fire alarm went off. The building was evacuated and I didnt know until two days later.  I do not recommend using it with children in the home and the weight gain isn't controllable. Another disadvantage is that problem of not being able to stop taking it. If you go out of town and forget it to bring it you will not sleep and become very sick the following day.

1762$Bipolar Disorder in Remission$3/1/2009 7:49:48 PM$Reviewer: patient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$2$"This medication seems to have been effective at preventing another bipolar episode for me.  However, I have experienced weight gain.  I had gained about 9lbs. previously while taking other meds.  Since switching to only Seroquel at 300mg a day, I have gained 5lbs more.  I think that this weight gain is due mainly to the medication.  I have had difficulty losing any of the weight and keeping it off.  I have never had a problem with being anything but slim before in my life. I have also had problems with grogginess, tiredness, difficulty waking up from sleep, and some difficulty in concentration.  My dose has just been decreased somewhat and I look forward to seeing if that eases my side effects.  It seems to be effective at helping me think positively.  As far as its effectiveness at treating regular depression apart from bipolar disorder, I think it is only somewhat effective at that, as I still have some symptoms of depression. The manufacturer of Seroquel, ""AstraZeneca, is trying to get approved for use by people suffering from depression.""  I have been on it for about a year, and will think it is very effective if I have had no bipolar episodes 3 to 4 years from now.  The Wall Street Journal online has some good articles about Seroquel and its efficacy and safety.

I have currently been on 600mg for about 13 months.  I went from being a hopeless 30+ year alcoholic (apparently self medicating bi-polar II), with frequent in-patient treatments, to a recovering alcoholic sober for over a year now.  I have no doubt that Seroquel saved my life.  I went from the brink of suicide to the most ""together"" I've felt in my 53 years.  The only thing different with my alcoholic treatment strategy this time was the Seroquel.  I've noticed a couple of posts saying Seroquel has some ""street value"" for drug abuse.  Hmmm....I would think that is the case only if you wanted to SLEEP on the street.  This stuff puts you in snooze mode, so take it before bed.  I have noticed absolutely no surreal or “feeling high” characteristics.  It does give you hunger fits, so you need to religiously follow Doctor's instructions and get regular blood work to test glucose levels, cholesterol and triglycerides.  You also need to work a responsible weight maintenance program.  Not too hard to do when your head is screwed on straight like Seroquel has done for me.  My anxiety level went from an extremely high level to what I perceive as low.  The world is now a pretty good place to live.  I should note that I am also on 325mg Effexor XR (SSRI) per day (past 5 years) and have no idea if the combination has somehow given me outstanding results. All I can say is Seroquel RULES for me.  Your mileage may vary."

The only downside is that I was diagnosed with diabetes this year and the only cause we can come up with is prolonged use of Seroquel.

I gained some weight on a previous medication and had wanted to lose that weight as well, but have not been able to get back down to my original weight, pre-bipolar meds.  I believe this weight gain may have aggravated an old knee injury from a few years ago.  This drug often makes it hard to stay alert during the daytime.  I'm experiencing some thinning hair around my hairline above my forehead, and wondering if it is from this drug.  Am also concerned about possibility of developing Type II Diabetes because of this drug.

It is ridiculous that some of the doctors who aggressively medicate arenÃ¢Â?Â?t cautious because the right dose of helpful medication can be life saving while a bad approach can cause instability that caused serious problems in my life then unfortunately psychiatrist often blame your condition over their inappropriate treatment so itÃ¢Â?Â?s important to be aware of whatÃ¢Â?Â?s going on with you.

Good- it calms me down when I feel agitated and my thoughts race. At higher dosages it helps with depression. I need it to help me fall asleep and stay asleep for 6-8 hrs. Not so good- I have to be in bed within 15 minutes of taking b/c I start to feel ""spacey"" and eventually dizzy. Unfortunately, if I wake up to go to the bathroom or get something to drink (it makes me thirsty sometimes) then I'm in trouble b/c I'm disoriented and lightheaded. If I get up too quickly from bed, I become very dizzy and have problems breathing like I can't get enough oxygen. I have accidentally walked into walls or lost in my closet. It's concerning that's how my brain reacts on Seroquel. It has negatively affected my libido and I can't orgasm after 15 minutes of taking it. I would have a very difficult time if I had to take it during the day and definitely would have to stop it because of dizziness and blunt affect (aka ""zombified""). But because I take it at bedtime it's ok. I don't want to take an antipsychotic but that's just the way it is right now. I am more med-compliant with my psychiatrist now that I taking Seroquel."

My daughter is 10 and has been on this medication for 3 1/2 weeks so far. It has helped with the hallucination and hearing of the violent voice. She doesn't hear it quite so often. When we first put her on it the 1st she was very groggy and had to be kept home from school. The second day she started waking up around noon...by the third day she was fine.  This happens each time we have to adjust her dosage so I plan accordingly to up it on the weekend.  Her moods are stabilizing and things are going better.

1. Gaining weight was a problem in the past, however it is not now. Exercising, eating lousy (yes, lousy), and taking supplements to help with the vitamin deficiencies have helped me over the years. My definition of eating lousy is: Ice Cream with lots of peanuts on top. At least once a day. I use protein shakes and mix in good things to make up for the loss of the most vital nutriants. I don't eat junk food, or drink soda. I drink iced tea and water. I've found that no calorie sweetners increase my anxiety. To help with constipation, I take an Acidopholus based supplement. Btw, I am NOT endorsing my methods of eating!
2. Seroquel makes me ""eat walk"". Definition: 1/2-3/4 hour after taking my Seroquel, I get hungry, so I head for the kitchen and get something to eat. Unfortunately, eating kicks in my Seroquel, causing me to stumble about in the kitchen, and frequently falling. I have slept quite a few nights on the kitchen floor due to this. A friend of mine who witnessed this, told me I was like a kid who didn't want to go to bed at night.
My answer to this has been to take a snack with me to bed. Because of this, I have many nightgowns with chocolate stains on them! 
A Seroquel friend of mine was the one who asked me if I had noticed that Seroquel kicks it in much more quickly after eating.
3. Know your dose. If you're on the hypomanic side of bp, talk to your pdoc if adjusting the dosage is right for you. I have found that Seroquel does not help with my depression, so my pdoc adjusts my dosage accordingly. I am atypical, so my dosage needs are normally higher than most others.
4. Don't give up the benefits of Seroquel because of the potential weight gain. Most of us know that finding a med that finally works can be really tough, and side effects come along with the package. There are so many different ways to stay active and get rid of any weight gain you might come across.
If I can do make it, You can too!"

(Honestly it was a blessing in disguise.) I had bouts of mania & depression on & off for over 18yrs untreated. At times I thought that there was nothing wrong with me & everyone else was the problem. During my 20's I experienced feelings of being immortal, invincible & on top of the world. I became a risk taker. All of these actions felt normal to me. I drank alcohol, used drugs, spent money without a care & later have buyers remorse or overwhelming feelings of guilt. Several times a year I would feel depressed & have thoughts of suicide but honestly never thought I would actually attempt it. Deep down I knew there was some type of chemical imbalance with the ups & down. Later I realized my actions greatly affected those around me. When I would start to feel mania or ""normal"",  I would forget about needing help & think everything was ok. Never once did I consider that I may have a mental illness. When I turned 30, I started having lower back pain that is now chronic. 3 years ago I also found out that I have arthritis and fibromyalgia & that these too are chronic. I tried a few antidepressants & pain management, none that really worked. I withdrew from life, stayed in bed & isolated myself, I became agitated, anxious & my stress level was through the roof. My relationship of 11 years became rocky & my partner left. Now, at 38yrs everything finally crashed together. So I tried to take my life.(I'm happy that didn't work out!) I was soon diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder during my hospital stay. My psychiatrist started me on a better pain regimen that works plus a low dose of Seroquel 50mg then up to only 100mg. My pain, mood & depression are more manageable & my relationship is back. I've combined that with therapy & proper rest. I'm back in my life and doing what I need to stay balanced. I have much work to do & may need to up my dose later. It's amazing how this med has evened me enough to enjoy life again."

It is effective in that meets the expectations for treatment however it has a nasty ""hangover"" effect.  I've been on it a year or so and I still wake up groggy.  It has other side effects like leaving me tired all day, slurred speech and slower processing.  As an educator, it sometimes impacts my ability to be on my ""A"" game because I am tired.  It also makes me a little irritable--I'm not sure if the trade-off is worth it (e.g., the medication and its side effects in lieu of suffering from bipolar).  Unfortunately, most psychotropic drugs have a downer effect and this one is no different.  It seems my experience is on par with most other people's.  Two things I know for sure, do not drink alcohol while taking this medication and make sure you take it several hours before you go to sleep, despite what your doctor may tell you.  Also, this medication (at least in Illinois) can get you a DUI if you are under its influence and driving.  Be aware!"

IT IS A WONDER DRUG!!!! Yes I too gained weight in the first month. It was worth it to me to be ""sane"" again!!! I have always suffered from what I thought was severe mania and I would work with my doctor and he let me adjust my meds accordingly. I don't drink alcohol OR do drugs that is a huge factor in the seroquel working for me! I was on very  high dose's of seroquel It was my decision not my doctors because of the delusions prior to me taking seroquel were very scary to me! It was like I was trapped in another world and I wasn't having fun! I  was on an average 300 mil of seroquel every night but at some points 600mil.  I was at the same job for 8 years and didn't even know they (my co workers) were stressing me out to the point I had to take such high doses. Well I was fired from that job and 3 months later I'm down to 100 mill a night and I have NEVER been happier! I'm a hair dresser and my clients all can tell I'm a different person!!! I've started losing weight 10 pounds since my dosages have changed. (  I lowered my meds  VERY SLOWLY,  otherwise you could spiral into depression) It really helps if you know the signs of your symptons. Which I was in denial because I was always happy (or so I thought) I didn't agree with the depression symptoms the internet told me I was having. But I now know it was the truth. I would have lowered my meds ALOT SOONER, IF I realized I wasn't as manic as I thought. I'm not sure if anyone else read before about when depressed we stop taking showers, Well I was only taking showers once a week, for time sakes or I'd be late for work! No one ever knew! I didn't smell or try to cover it up with perfume! Of course I never went to the gym so I was never sweaty and all gross! Well I hoped this has helped someone, if you'd like to contact me I'm at [email protected]'m Kat BTW. Good luck and GOD BLESS"

My condition was mild and primarily depressed with some anxiety and OCD until trying Lexapro a few months which triggered an awful mixed episode. At first, as with almost everyone, I was started on a low dose of Seroquel, in my case to be elevated in three stages. The first two went pretty smoothly after a few days of brain fog and fatigue. I did not feel 100%, but was alot better than I had been, and started to enjoy life again. My depression was greatly alleviated and my anxiety became totally manageable.  However, I have had a very hard time dealing with the third stage of titration (still a comparably low dose considering how much some others are taking), which even after a few days I am finding too sedating and have new side effects such as a kind of pressure headache. I know it needs to be bumped up as the initial relief I have had with the lower dosages have waned a good bit. I am just really hoping I can adjust to it and get the same results consistently in the future. Also,even with insurance, this is proving to be a very costly medication. I am happy with it because it is the only med that has provided many any relief, but you may want to discuss alternatives considering its sedation and high price.

Good combo of drugs.  However, Seroquel's side effects are considerable.  They are manageable, but you have to put in some effort--get blood tests to check your thyroid and cholesterol and fats, eat really healthy and work out or you will gain weight, schedule your days so you can always get 9-10 hours of sleep even if you have to go to bed by 8pm.  The heart palpitations don't hit me if I stay in bed once I take it--the palpitations only show up if I try to fight through the drowsiness to move around, so I just plan to be in bed for 10 hours.  It's a question of what you're willing to put up with to be stable emotionally.  Bipolar made my life hell, as long as I could remember, and for the first time, I've been stable for more than a few weeks at a time.  2 good years and counting.

First starting it was a lil rough just because you do feel really tired for a couple weeks, but nothing to bad. Especially in comparison to how I was feeling. I was getting panic attacks on a daily basis, and then crashing hard into depression. I started at 50 mg 1 x a day, now I take 400mg 2 x a day and have been very even. Of course there are ups and downs.. as life does throw us curve balls here and there. But I have felt able to cope with them. I also take Zoloft for depression, that combo has worked out really good for me. I am thinking about adding lithium to my regime just because I am now starting to have higher ups and lower lows.. maybe that will help balance things back out. All though I have had a lot of recent stresses added to my life, a little something extra would probably help me out for a short term thing. If you haven't tried it, it's worth giving a shot!

That in itself has been a god send.  Being able to sleep after years of insomnia is amazing.  I am concerned about the weight gain.  Has been approx. 30 lbs over the four years.  I have a wonderful man in my life who thinks I am still beautiful, very important!!!  I worry about the blood sugar but so far so good.  I go to sleep about an hour after taking but have found a schedule that works for me.  Won't babysit my 2 yr old grandson overnight because I can't guarantee I would wake up if he did.  Getting up in the morning has become a little more difficult so will need to adust for that.  Just have to find what works for you!  I know this drug isn't for everyone, that's for sure.

Helped me to sleep at first, but after about the 6 month mark it did not help with sleep as much. Did not seem to help the paranoia and anxiety. Really, it just helped me sleep at first and stopped the racing thoughts. Caused akathisia within 1 hour of taking it at first. Close to the 1 year mark, the akathisia became persistent and lasted all day. Caused me to have an extremely unnerving feeling that I can't even begin to describe. This was usually within 1 hour of taking it, but was persistent throughout the day with a higher dose. My muscles were twitching really bad all the time.

After taking it for a week i noticed i had less of an appetite than usual and had already started to lose weight. I hallucinated and saw shadows moving across the walls, i heared voices and noises coming from both inside and outside our home. Soon i believed that someone wanted to harm myself and/or my family in some way and we were all in danger. At the end of the third week of taking Seroquel i had stopped eating altogether and i had lost almost 30 pounds. I couldn't work because i had so much anxiety and depression due mainly from extreme sleep deprivation. I was hospitalized and treated.

I tried to make it work, but I started to notice several things. First I started falling when I got out of bed. Then I could not catch myself with my arms. Then a few days later I started having tremors and my head would shake like Parkinson's. One day my boss told me he was concerned because I have forgotten things that I have done normally for years. I went to a neurologist and he said that my left side of my body was unstable. 
After talking with my doctor, he recommended that I switch to Lamictal. Lamictal has been a life saver for me.. that is when I started to truly heal and be able to make decisions. I would say that if you are having symptoms that are worry some and scare you, please talk to you counselors and therapist. You have to find the right combination when you have this disorder.

I have been on Seroquel now for 7 weeks. Im gaining weight but when ur 28 and weigh 93lbs thats a good thing for me. I do get up throughout the night and find myself eating not just normal food I want chocolate. I eat excessive amounts of it so im a lil scared of the diabetic side affect so im trying to watch that but all in all I really like this medicine because I feel good about myself. No more mood swings and being mean and whatnot. The suicide thoughts are GONE. I feel great. Still tired for bout 2 hours in the morning after taking it but for my happiness back ill deal with that. I guess to avoid turning diabetic i need to slow down on the chocolate but I DO find this medicine seems to be working well for me. I take 200mg in the morning and 200mg at night about an hour before bedtime.

Started at 75 and currently at 800 mg spread out daily. Mania and depression are both aided satisfactorily. Side effects that were part of Zyprexa are drastically lessened: increased appetite, hypersomnia, and cognitive hindrance are wonderfully diminished in comparison. Nasal congestion has been a significantly annoying problem, particularly with sleep. Tiredness is also noticeable, but not worse than with Zyprexa. Strangely, effects can be erratic: a dosage that often quickly puts to sleep can have a much more muted effect the night afterwards and has required me to take 50-100% more to fall asleep, without the presence of caffeine, chocolate or other stimulants. This odd inconsistency has been constant since day one of taking it.

However, I think it also makes me completely robotic and lifeless and the 'balance' I have in my life is actually me totally placating. I started on regular release and am now cutting myself off of XR. This drug makes me always groggy/hazy. Cannot wake up in the mornings. Pretty oblivious to things outside of myself. Totally uncreative. And, MAJOR weight gain.

2627$Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$2/21/2014 2:11:25 PM$Reviewer: Be of good cheer!, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Seroquel XR as a PRN medication for me together with the combination of 2 other medications (Depakote ER and a once-a-month intramuscular injection: Invega Sustenna) have done wonders for the control of the Bipolar I Disorder mental issue that I have. For years I've struggled with not getting enough sleep at one time period. My extremes of mood swings are ever so much lighter and the manic and depressive phases likewise more controlled.
As in all cases one medication may not work as well for one person as another and maybe not the same dosage either or combination of meds. There are differing dosages of Seroquel XR that may be needed to adjust the amount. I have found out throughout the years that if I could get the proper amount of sleep, most of the time, I wouldn't have a situation whereby I needed to be hospitalized. I've lost count as to the nummber of times hospitalized.
As with all medications it takes time(usually 2 t0 3wks.) to realize if a medication will be successful and most the time there will also be side effects and some are only temporary. I highly recommend that a person not self-medicate with illicit drugs. Watch out for triggers that will sabotage your well-being. As always if possible have a mental health professional guide you through your journey dealing mental hygiene. Do not give up!

I feel confident self assured and at ease around people now. I used to be paranoid that everyone knew I was bipolar....Have had this disease since 1982 but am sure i had it earlier than age 22. Seroquel to me is a wonder drug. I am glad my psych tried this with me and hope it will always work.

These are the one's for which I've had some relief by taking Seroquel XR 200mg 2 to 3 hours before bedtime: anxiety, insomnia, & psychosis. I firmly believe getting enough sleep each night on a regular basis is one of the best strategies for avoiding mental health crises along with proper diet and exercise routines. Doing things for others can often be therapeutic in his/her own health situations! I've had biploar 1 disorder since ~ 14 and I'm now 54 - by the grace of God, His mercy, and Providence am I still alive as likewise all other humans. Have a good day!

It has been agreed--by my husband, doctor, and I--that I will not be put on another bipolar medication; I will be put on an antidepressant since depression is the biggest factor in my Bipolar II.

Also, it made me feel like i had a stomack flu and threw up about 3 out of the 4 days i was on it.  My opinion, if you have bipolar, take drugs that are strickly for biploar, do not take meds that are for one sickness and happen to help another (for reasons that the Dr.'s don't even know how they work)!  I am very upset about the lack of information i was given from my Doctor.  Also she gave me no mention of the extreme weight gain associated with this drug.

I had a cocktail that I took every night. My doctor and I decided to try to see if I could get off of some of the medications that I was being treated for Bipolar 1 and Mania, PST, ADD, Insomnia. So, I tried this medication. I loved it, but yes it has side effects. Restlessness in the legs, groggy in the morning then it would go away. My weight did go up, but I got the best sleep. My dreams were coming back, my moods swing decreased. I was not agitated or in a rage. It works! I did go off of it because of the weight gain, but after reading so many of these reviews I am going back on. I will have a long chat with my shrink the next time as to how to deal with some of these side effects. I just did my blood work up and it was all good. If I am going to take this medication again then I will need to do a follow-up with blood workups. The restless leg, I was taking gabapentin. It helped with this problem. I would say if you try it you going to have to watch out. Get your blood workup first, watch the side effects, ask your family to get involved to watch you. There is nothing worse than a bipolar rage. It is why there are so many people in jail that have had an episode and didn't know that is what was going on. I diagnosed five years ago. I am now 64. I can't tell you how many failed relationships, lost jobs, losing my home. The only thing that kept me from killing myself is I am a Catholic. Until I was diagnosed, I thought I was an alien that didn't belong on this planet.

Oh, and I am a man.  I was on Seroquel for years, but I have to admit, I got off of it and vowed never to return.  It was the weight gain.  I can't remember the timetable but over the coarse of months upon starting it I shot up.  By the end I peaked at 200 pounds, and I'm 5'6""!  To be fair, there was another reason that changed my mind about the med, it was the foggy feeling it left.  I just felt dull.  I have to admit, I was on a lion-share of it, totaling 900mg.  I'm guessing at lower doses the foggy feeling might be minimal.  I never made it that far to find out.  So, in short, the weight gain and the foggy feeling were too much for me.  I have since been on a number of other drugs but settled upon Latuda.  Latuda has worked out for me.  No weight problems or fogginess.  Ask your doctor about Latuda. "

Even tho, it took care of those problems I put on ALOT of weight w/it. I was on 900mg and I put on 100 lbs in less than 4 mos while I was on it. It just makes you eat ALL the time and makes u feel hungry. I am definitely upset w/ my overall experience while I was on Seroquel(8 yrs); and I would not recommend this med to anyone. My Dr. switched me to Trazadone and Lamictal in conjunction w/ Depakote to treat my Bi-polar Disorder and this combo really works 4 me. Now, the Seroquel weight is slowly starting 2 finally come off.

Ive been on this med for over 20 years I believe and started with a low dose (50mg) and ended up on a high does (800-1200mg).  I heard that Seroquel is effective under 800mg and that no more in necessary but Im not sure if thats true.  For the first time in 20 years I am off Seroquel for 18 days today and it has been a miserable ride.  The first 5 days was serious vomiting, nausea and severe headaches.  I lost 12 pounds in a week because I couldnt eat.  So far its day 18 and Ive experienced severe withdrawls.  I did a 3 week taper but it was not long enough coming off that high of dose.  I have had severe headaches, audio issues, smells issues, racing heart rate, nausea, stuffy nose, ear pain and general insomnia.  I think this drug is amazing for it's healing properties but be very careful coming off of it.  Withdraw with a doctor's help and be very careful about tapering it properly.

Here's the bad part. It has to be taken at bedtime and you have to allow 8-9 hours of sleep.  It also causes significant weight gain.  However as a person who has had insomnia my whole life with constant manic highs it's made these symptoms completely disappear.  I also got a lap band so the weight gain is no more.  I do not take this medicine during the day so I don't have the tiredness with it.  Even with the side effects it has made all the difference in my life!

In other words, I'm usually ""bouncing off the ceiling"" and very, very rarely get depressed.

I was a mess, hadnt slept in months, manic right to the edge. Then we found Seroquel.  From the 1st 25 mg dose, I felt different. I worked slowly up to 150, didnt like the effects at that dose and went down to 100 mgs. Doc and I agree that sometimes the dose needs to be adjusted to help me cope with stress (which brings on the MANIC MONSTER) but lower dose is usually good for all.  And it allows me to practice other coping techniques. So I watch what I eat, control the carb cravings with health snacks and get my 8 hours.  I would rather deal with the side effects than live like a lunatic on the fringe.

The only reason for one star is that if you are diabetic DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  Don't get me wrong it works well but it did take some time to get used to it (out of body feeling, severe muscle twitches and cramps, feeling like I was not standing on the floor but rather floating).  Then after taking it for about a year developed HIGH cholesterol (651) and OFF THE SCALE  triglycerides (over 4600 - yes 4600 - not a mistake) in blood tests at Mayo Clinic. A soon as  I stopped taking it and all went back to normal with temporary help from chol/trig meds.  By the way docs at Mayo are not allowed to give it to diabetic patients.

It brings me down to earth when I take it PRN for mania. It helps me sleep when I am ""excited"" with mania. The only thing I have against it is the WEIGHT GAIN. When I was on it regularly, daily, my weight went up 20 lbs. Now that I take it only PRN for feelings of mania, my weight is stable. It took me 1 year to lose the weight! I have to take it with my Effexor XR, as the Effexor makes me feel manic. It's only been 2 weeks. Effexor XR has helped me lose 4 lbs. I wonder what the Seroquel will do now? If I continue to feel manic on the Effexor XR and my weight increases because of having to take the Seroquel so often, I will stop both."

I take 600 mg at bedtime. It helps me sleep very well and all night. It also helps me with my mood. My depression was also lessened. Im not so mopey. But this medication can make you really ""out of it"". It's very hard to function after taking it. My heart races. And it makes me VERY hungry when it kicks in. It also makes it hard to communicate as well. If someone asks me something after taking it im very incoherent. I also don't remember things that I did while it's in my system. Like if someone calls you on your phone you answer it because of habit. But I can't really remember the phone call. My memory isn't the best either. I believe this med is the cause of it. In my opinion the side effects to me are not as important as how I feel and moods are a lot better. The side effects that i mentioned I have had for a long time. I have been on this medication now for 3 years. "

2098$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$8/16/2008 2:04:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$3$A couple weeks ago, I had a manic episode with psychotic features. I was on Geodon and Lithium when it occured. At the hospital I was tapered off of the Geodon and started on the seroquel. It wasn't until I had reached the 600mg at night dosage that I was able to finally sleep eight hours. However, I do wake up often during the night. I have been on the 600 mg dose for over a week and my psychotic symptoms are finally starting to fade. Because of Seroquel, I wake up drowsy, foggy, and have a dry mouth. Also, the severe perpetual hunger caused by the seroquel has just about driven me crazy. I am determined not to gain weight on Seroquel so I am toughing out the hunger and watching what I eat for the three meals a day I do eat. So in summary, the seroquel took a little while to accomplish its task and its side effects are bothersome. I am hoping that the side effects will disapear once I become accustomed to this drug. I don't know how long that is going to take because with Geodon it took three to four months before the side effects disapeared. I don't know if I can be severely hungry for that long.

I take 200mg along with 1500mg of lithium, 30mg of abilify, 200mg of trazodone and 150mg of lamictal. I guess the way it works for me is that it knocks me out for about 18 hours a day. I can't function while on it, since I feel so groggy and continuously tired. Half of the time, I can't even open my eyes. It does help with the sleep, otherwise I'd be up for days at a time. But as far as the mania, it hasn't helped me much yet. Maybe because I'm always sleeping and the time that I am awake, I'm irritated, moody and very anxious. Maybe it will get better in time though.

In Jan. 2005, I started feeling hostile toward people and feelings of anger and destruction were brewing. I didn't like this, so my doctor put me on Seroquel's lowest dose.

I started to blame myself because I didnt stay awake for 15 more minutes. That way I could have done something. That way I could tell myself I tried something. When I got put on these meds (effexor xr, seroquel and xanax) my mind doesnt wonder. I don't dwell on things anymore. I've learned how to except my moms death as not my fault. I also learned how to change my thinking when I start to think about things that I might have done wrong but didn't know if I really did. I'm sorry I wrote so much.

I was prescribed these in May 2018 after a difficult time and they helped me for the first couple of months, however, the past few months I've been unable to wake up, I never feel rested and I have zero energy, this is a drastic change for me as I was previously a gym bunny eating a clean, high calorie diet.

I was taking this alongside, Pregabalin 200mg (now stopped) and Citalopram 40mg (now 30mg).

My review is just to share my experience and to see if anyone else shares the same side effects as it's had a massive impact on my lifestyle both inside and outside of work. 

Hopefully my GP can find something more suited."
46$Manic-Depression$10/10/2014 1:32:07 PM$Reviewer: Wendy, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been taking Seroquel for 6 months & it has been as vital as a heart pill or any other that helps you maintain a healthy life. There are side-effects, and some are not pleasant but I find that the benefits have greatly outweighed any negatives. In the beginning, I was often tired and had a hard time waking up in the morning, but that has evened out over the months. I also had an initial weight gain of 10 pounds, mostly caused by the Seroquel “munchies” as I call them. And that has also leveled off. You do need to pay closer attention to your diet on it. There is also a strange reaction where you want to move your limbs while you are resting. I found that decreasing my dose some helped with that. 
Now the positives: I have never slept better. I used to wake up multiple times during the night and had a difficult time falling to sleep. I now get at least 8 hours of the night and wake up feeling calm and relaxed. And it is a deep, restful sleep. It does not feel artificial or leave me with a medicinal hangover. Sleep has done wonders for my health. I no longer have bad headaches or muscle cramps throughout the day. I rarely have to take ibuprophen (which I used to take almost daily). No more self-medicating with alcohol or alcohol cravings.But the best and most significant difference is that I have finally found my calm! I can be happy, satisfied and content with little things. It's also made me more patient with others. I now know the meaning of peace of mind. It’s no longer me against the world looking for the enemy in everyone I meet. I feel at ease when I wake up and actually enjoy my morning coffee, watching tv, and reading without interruptions from intrusive thoughts.I no longer lash out at my husband or scream at my kids. My compulsions for self-destructive behavior have melted away kind of like a demon leaving my body. I cannot tell you what a huge relief that is. Everything is lighter without the weight of your own guilt and shame. It gave me my life back"
59$Manic-Depression$1/22/2014 3:36:47 PM$Reviewer: predisposed, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$2$4$"An effective downer for the mania-prone, no question. But no one's kidding about the side effects practically rivaling the problems for which you're taking it (which makes me wonder how the first-gens could have possibly been worse, but that's what I hear.), and withdrawing from this one's worse than usual.

The most severe problem when trying to come off this once it becomes intolerable is the unbelievable nausea that comes on within a couple days if your tapering rate is off, and is comparable to drinking way too much. It is not pleasant, to put it mildly. When I withdrew too quickly, the nausea was all-encompassing and even basic finger-movements were like short free-falls.

Don't screw around with this stuff, it punishes you hardcore if you stop taking it or taper off too quickly.

I'd recommend this for periods of mania, but not when you don't need it for that. It caused me to be listless, apathetic, and like pretty much all antipsychotics I've tried (though nowhere near to the same extent as the sadistic side effects of Zyprexa), causes what is commonly termed ""brain fog"", which makes you feel, well, drugged. In my case, it was so bad that I would not accept it. I'm still trying to taper off it, but nothing's been more unpleasant than quetiapine in this regard.

It's still vastly superior to Risperdal and definitely Zyprexa, and probably some other antipsychotics that were so disorienting I literally could not remember long periods of time while being on them. But it's the best of the worst, as it is. Take with extreme caution, and be wary of taking it for long.

Seroquel helps me get my full 7 hours of sleep, which probably helps with keeping me more calm in the morning.  I don't like that I'm not as energetic- but then again that may just be the mania that i like feeling.  i hear some people gain weight- I'm one of the few% that lost like 10 lbs.  Maybe with more sleep i just eat less. I hear there's a class action lawsuit against this rx.  People claim that they should have told them it increases risk of diabetes.  Most of the bipolar meds do.  I'm considering to stop taking this rx because I want it out of my system before my husband and I try for a baby.  My condition is more mild so hopefully things will be ok without the rx.

After waiting 6 months to get into a Psychiatrist to wein him off this and onto 10mg of Lexapro he was doing much better. 
My son experienced episodes of psycosis, agresssive behavior, personal harm, including punching himself in the face, cutting his forearms with a butterknife bc I hid everything else. Then he took a shaving razor apart and cut his finger tips to where they were all bleeding. The dose he was put on was way too high for his size said his psychiatrist. during the weining process he devoloped insomnia and anorexia. My son is dealing well with only 10 mg of Lexapro now, he's happy and more himself. He was bullied in school to the point we had to get Police involved.

246$Manic-Depression$5/20/2015 12:47:36 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$3$I have been on Seroquel 300mg XR 2x/day for over 2 years now and I have found that it significantly helps with my bipolar disorder. I rarely have the horrible mood swings and debilatating depression. My only problem with this med is the weight gain that often goes along with it. I have gained about 40lbs. since taking it. I was also taking it in conjunction with other psych meds. I have been able to get off one of those meds in which weight gain was ALSO a side effect. I have been able to drop a few pounds since then which is good. BUT as for overall effectiveness of Seroquel, I have to say it has been a real Godsend. I don't get tired anymore after taking it, I don't get dizzy anymore. You just have to give it time. I am on a hefty dose considering the dose is XR and I take it twice a day which my pharmacist can't understand since XR is supposed to last 24 hrs. BUT, I trust my psychiatrist immensely so I go with it. But, for anyone starting out on this med, you probably will have side effects in the beginning. Just give it time, it will work.

There are side-effects, and some are not pleasant but I find that the benefits have greatly outweighed any negatives. In the beginning, I was often tired and had a hard time waking up in the morning, but that has evened out over the months. I also had an initial weight gain of 10 pounds, mostly caused by the Seroquel “munchies” as I call them. And that has also leveled off. You do need to pay closer attention to your diet on it. There is also a strange reaction where you want to move your limbs while you are resting. I found that decreasing my dose some helped with that. 
Now the positives: I have never slept better. I used to wake up multiple times during the night and had a difficult time falling to sleep. I now get at least 8 hours of the night and wake up feeling calm and relaxed. And it is a deep, restful sleep. It does not feel artificial or leave me with a medicinal hangover. Sleep has done wonders for my health. I no longer have bad headaches or muscle cramps throughout the day. I rarely have to take ibuprophen (which I used to take almost daily). No more self-medicating with alcohol or alcohol cravings.But the best and most significant difference is that I have finally found my calm! I can be happy, satisfied and content with little things. It's also made me more patient with others. I now know the meaning of peace of mind. It’s no longer me against the world looking for the enemy in everyone I meet. I feel at ease when I wake up and actually enjoy my morning coffee, watching tv, and reading without interruptions from intrusive thoughts.I no longer lash out at my husband or scream at my kids. My compulsions for self-destructive behavior have melted away kind of like a demon leaving my body. I cannot tell you what a huge relief that is. Everything is lighter without the weight of your own guilt and shame. It gave me my life back"

Found out that Seroquel can cause diabetes.  There was a class action suit against them, and they lost.  You can still enter in that suit for a few months yet.  I slowly went off Seroquel, was more carful of my diet, and my A1C a month later was normal.  As much as this drug helped, I will never take it again.

Yes, it does tend to give one the munchies and I actually gained enough to need 'weight loss surgery' caused by it and maybe other medications I was on. But Seroquel WORKS for me and I can already tell a difference in the short time that I've been on it this time around. I take 100 mgs. at bedtime so I don't feel buzzed all day long and am able to fully function, driving and everything. I feel at peace with myself now and I've learned from my past weight gain from it to 'nip it in the bud', not giving in to the eating urges. Instead having a diet root beer or bottle of water to fill me.
I've been on SO, SO many different drugs with my hypo-mania that I've discovered that EVERY SINGLE ONE has side effects but if the benefits out way the side effects, we are blessed.

I am still suffering from insomnia, I was tired, but the anxiety was far more overwhelming than the tiredness. It did allow me to become drowsy, but I was still depressed, worsened now by the feeling of never being able to sleep. My anxiety, depression and insomnia were not helped with this at all. I have found myself more willing to lay around than to move. The thought of eating doesn't appeal to me, causing weight loss. I have short term memory problems. Muscle cramps, eye twitching and increased dry mouth, fatigue and general lack of interest are the side effects that are kicking my back side now. It may work for some, but not for me. UGH!

My Dr wants to increase it til I get to 200mg daily. Problem that I am having is that at 100mg daily, I am sleeping til noon and have become very lathargic and have lost so much of my motivation. Before taking Seroquel, I worked from morning til I went to bed never stopping. I was always in a state of being very manic. I take it with 200mg of Zoloft daily. If I am this lathargic at 100mg of Seroquel, what am I going to be like at 200mg? I'm very worried about it. I don't see my Dr for another month but in the meantime, I took it upon myself to drop the dosage down to 75m daily. I came to WebMD hoping to find a list of side effects from Seroquel but so far haven't seen any.

I have suffered  severe OCD for decades. I did not expect the seroquel to help the OCD. OMG!!!  For the first time in decades my OCD is under control. I asked my psychiatrist if this could be true and he said yes. First I tried 400mg and it helped my bipolar a little but I still had nagging depression. My doctor increased it to 600 mg a day. At this dose I was 99% free of my OCD. I am a nurse and need to concentrate on work and not be distracted by my OCD. I know seroquel has possible side effects like, diabetes, high cholesterol, cataracts, but you know I really don't care. I want to live for today and be happy.

I am in NO means saying that every adult or every child will have these same results,but for our granddaughter & for us,Seroquel,along with therapy has been a life saver.
It is my hope that more people that have Bi-Polar Mania will be able to find relief & control over their lives with whatever their Dr's medicine regimen may be.God Bless"

i got on lithium but kept the seroquel and i was perfect. once i got past the severe headaches (2 to 3 times a week-cure sleep)and diarreah(everyday plus vomitting for teh first two weeks, now i randomly get it), the lithium helped with my mania and with seroquel i get the sleep i need at night(with the occasional dream of hell or some taboo thing).SEROQUEL BY ITSELF DID NOT WORK BUT IN COMBO WITH A ANTI DEPRESSANT AND ANOTHER BIPOLAR MED IT WORKS WONDERS,a  PSYCHOLOGIST THAT I HAVE SEEN HAS SAID THAT COMMONLY IT TAKES TWO BP MEDS TO WORK EFFECTIVELY but everyone is different, i am more stable now than i ever been since i was 13 years old, its put an end on the strain its caused my family(dealing with a unstable bp in mania = divorce, and now i am studying engineering in college) "

I won't take Seroquel on a daily basis as I fear weight gain. I have an eating disorder and I find this drug difficult to take because of the increased appetite and weight gain as side effects. It has been a lifesaver for sleep during hypomanias! When I am hypomanic this has been the only thing to get me to sleep after days without any or very little sleep. I have not found it helpful for the depression aspect. I did take it daily before and I had thoughts to self-injure. That was after I initially started taking Seroquel. Overall, I'd strongly recommend this drug for Bipolar disorder.

I in one year  slept anywhere between 12-18 hours a day. I didn't leave my house or room for that matter and went from 200lbs to 427lbs. This drug not only made me worse it gave me type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol,ischemia along with heart palpitations and morbid obesity! This drug ruined my health and my spirit to live! I would definitely urge anyone that is using this medication to think whether they are taking it to escape everyday life and reality by sleeping it away or are you taking it to get back to your healthy self? I believe this drug is very dangerous and has effected my body in all the negative ways. If anyone would like to reach me concerning this email please feel free to email me at [email protected]

Well all this one did was make me sleep. Which I don't need help with. I have other meds that are fine but this one makes me angry easily, frustrated, gained almost 20 lbs in 6 months, nearly gotten myself into several altercations due to this medication having such an negative effect on my behavior. Which is was to make me more stable...all it did was make me want to harm others. It had gotten so bad that I actually drove myself to my the hospital & literally cried for help as I knew if I continued on this path that one day it would cause my end. With little help from this medication, severe weight gain in little time, mood altering & sleep inducing, for me this medication was THE worst thing my doctors could have put me on.
I have family who has been helped wonderfully & no lead normal & happy lives due to this ""wonder drug"", but for me it was a terribly scary experience that I would never want to experience again."

I now have a set of $3,000.00 FULL DENTURES!!  I was prescribed this med. for sleep (diagnosed Bi-polar in 1996) along with Restoril, Valium, and Ambien CR!

I really hate this drug!!!  If you take this medication, I STRONGLY recommend you see the dentist every 3 months!!  By the way...Serowuel is NOT approved for the treatment of sleep disorders!!

1993$Manic-Depression$10/19/2008 3:12:28 PM$Reviewer: Anonymous, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$5$"       I have Bipolar 1 and I am 16 years old.  I was diagnosed February my freshmen year of high school and they put me on Lamictal in June.  It treated some of my symptoms in the first month: extreme interest in sex, delusional thinking, depression, and others I can't even remember because they stopped.  But I added Seroquel last May (October now).  Stress and bad sleeping patterns set me off, and I am pretty good about recognizing when I am about to go through an episode or what state I am in.
       I take a dose of 150 Lamictal (2x a day), 200 Seroquel (2x day).  I was a little out of shape when I started Seroquel, so its side effects were strong, especially dizziness (I would sit down for a long time and when I got up, I lost my balance, couldn’t see because my vision would go white.  And I usually fell down or smacked into a wall, not fun…).  I don’t like the dizziness and this started the day after I began taking it.  Being in good physical shape can really help.   Seroquel also causes me to have episodes that I call panic attacks that started when I increased it.
     A trypical “panic attack”:  I have trouble thinking and functioning mentally.  I’m a vegetable.  And when I am trying to do a certain thing, like math, it frustrates me and then I loose it.  I start to cry, my breathing gets messed up, and I can’t put 2 and 2 together to save my life.  Someone will try to ask me a question and instead of answering, I start crying and breathing fast, my heart-rate skyrockets, I repeat phrases like “I don’t know” because I can’t think and I’m completely terrified.  This is set off by stress and a change in sleeping patterns.
        I’m not sure if Seroquel is a good thing even though my doctor thinks it is.  But even though my doctor disagrees, I can honestly pinpoint some bad things to this medication.  If it works for you, great, if it doesn’t, we might have something in common."

I was in the middle of cycling phases. The M.D. put me on 100mg and after 3 days bumped to 200mg. I had a severe nerviousness, low b/p, general body weakness. Always question your doctor about what they are using this medication for(diagnosis) and request that you start low & graually go up as needed. As a patient you have a right to ask questions. If the doctor gets offened, then you need a new doctor. I left a program because I felt the doctors were not listening, but always telling. Now I will find a new program. I do recommend education via mental health facilities. You will learn more at a facility than at most doctors offices, unless you find the best doctor ever, but don't count on it!

It's great to be able to sleep every night.I tried easing up on the effexor, but immediately had the constant body pains that i had all my life, so the combo is what works.I no longer have  my physical,emotional and mental life filled with confusion and pain.Weight gain has been the biggest problem, i have gone from 150 to 180!!!,a dry mouth, and receding gums concern me.Also a series of skin infections on my feet continuously.I sometimes have bad heartburn, but perhaps this is also due to weight gain.I am rarely sick, have fewer colds or headaches than before.I cannot take the summer heat, and find that sweating comes with any physical exertion at all.I am concerned about raised sugar levels, I seem to crave sweets.I also am thirsty a lot.And finally, the price is outrageous-$760 for one of the seoquel prescriptions. My health ins. does not pay for scripts, but was the only ins.I could find that covered mental health.My health ins. is my biggest monthly expense, more than house etc.It is clearly discriminatory for those of us needing meds and mental health coverage.Despite the side effects, I cannot imagine living without it."

Personally, I would recommend Seroquel as an alternative to Zyprexa for anybody. The side effects are a bit similar, but not nearly as acute or inhibiting. If you're considering Zyprexa for a psychiatric disorder, Seroquel is probably a much wiser choice. It's a more advanced drug, and it doesn't impair your cognitive abilities or motivation like the older ones do. It will increase your appetite, but I've found that side effect to decrease over time. The biggest problem, though, is that it will be very hard for you to wake up the first few mornings as your system gets used to it.

I feel rested at night, but not overly sedated when I wake up. I did gain some weight, but really needed to since my manic phases lasted one to two months, and I wouldn't eat much during them. I would recommend trying this medication. Also if you read that someone is overly sedated and they are taking 2 or 3 other medications, it's probably safe to say it could be the combination. Of course you also have to consider what extra cirricular drugs these manic patients are also trying.

Others and I noticed that I became more docile and that my ability to accept minor turmoil was improved. I wouldn't expect any doctor to prescribe this stuff to people with newly diagnosed conditions. I learned that drinking alcohol while under this treatment is very precarious, but not after I almost put myself in a coma.

The combination probably saved my life. My concerns with Seroquel are the potential side effects and I think that it mixes badly with alcohol. I've had several experiences of complete loss of memory from having just a few drinks and I think that I've narrowed it down to Seroquel. If I have to choose between life or martinis, I'll choose life!

I had to self medicate with alcohol before this and my alcohol dependence went away. My severe alcoholism caused 2 hip replacements. The earlier in the evening you take it, the better your tomorrow will be because this drug at 300mg will be noticably on you the next day. Sleep all night guaranteed. The best relief for my extreme nervousness and anxiety. Keep the dose around 150mg 2hrs before bedtime so you can still function the next day. Higher doses cause high grogginess  the next day. This drug at low doses is better than other popular drugs at high doses. I didn't experience any weight gain. Highly recommend this for manic depression anxiety PTSD bi-polar ect. Astra Zenca, the manufacturer, will give it to you free with perscrip. and if you are under $30,000 or ther abouts. Otherwise its about $500/month without insurance "

Lowered immunity increases supseptability to allergies, apnea, illness, DECREASES energy sustanability, restfull sleep required for healing, oxygen in blood stream required for; thinking(rationally), healing, being productive, exorcise or any activity. Emotional function goes from muted at best (can be non-existent/ ""flat-faced"", un-opinionated with delayed/slowed introspection to extrapolation, disinterested, un-involved, goal-less, uncommunacative with self and others, mechanical),  to balancing dotted with episodes of physical and/or emotional anxiety, panic attacks when pushed by self or others, even in safe senarios,can become agrophobic at times, or suddenly severly depressed and crying, uncontrollably sobbing while attempting to rationalize random unfounded reaction, thinking, problem solving becomes more clear, cognitive exercises and games help, almost as though reprograming an old computer, patience for there will be frustration, doubt and hope, fear and delight over progress. Breathing, anti-anxiety, and life skill training techniques, diet, exercise (esp. cardio), monitored nutrition, sun daily, improving sleep habits are all good tools. I wish you the best! "
