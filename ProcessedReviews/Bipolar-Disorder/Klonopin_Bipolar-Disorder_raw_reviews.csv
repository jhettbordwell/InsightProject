24$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder, Adjunct Treatment$2/1/2017 5:47:28 AM$Reviewer: Don,  Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Great for ""resetting"" at bedtime when feeling a little upswing with Bipolar. I have noticed after a day of being a little up, the Klonopin drops the intensity and brain energy nicely to allow for rest and relaxing. I do notice that if I don't take it, because I may not feel like I need it one night, that it is harder to get to sleep. I also have experienced some short term memory loss when taking 1.5 mg (3 x .5 mg) the next day. It has also helped me with anxiety when depressed. Great drug! I bought it here https://drugstoresale24hss.com Good luck to everybody!"

It keeps me even keel during the day. I word search which is frustrating, but I'm a high functioning ""closet"" BiPolar Type II patient who keeps regular appts and is compliant with my meds. I occasionally have acute on chronic episodes that I can now recognize and control with behavior modification. No easy feat! Without Klonopin I cannot sleep and experience significant withdrawal symptoms. I've tried to come off Klonopin without success. I currently take 3 mg q.HS and I started at 1 mg, so it does begin to lose its efficacy which is why I tried to switch earlier than later, but my it took 7 years to go from 1 mg to needing 3 mg, so my psychiatrist I guess isn't going to sweat it. Fine by me :-)"

Not only won't the Doctor's tell you it's highly addictive but you will want to blow your brains out when going through withdrawals from it and no doctor,therapist, or psychiatrist will inform you just how truamatizing the withdrawal will be. It was like the absolute worst acid trip I've ever been on and no Doctor, therapist or psychiatrist will help you. They will leave you to go through this hellacious withdrawal at home, totally alone. Klonopin withdrawal forced me to have to make the decision of either continue living in a world filled with nothing more than excruciating pain, terror, anxiety and fear or DIE, and I prayed so hard for death. It is criminal that this drug is even legal. And it's worse that not one single professional will tell you a damn thing. The National guidelines for prescribing this Benzo is 2-4 weeks. Then why in the hell has my psychiatrist had me on it for over 8 years,along with millions of others ????

DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG! I was depressed and had anxiety disorders and this drug gave me the inability to make decisions, not be able to understand what I was doing and how severe my actions were.  I attempted suicide twice while on this drug.  After stopping due to this I had a severe seizure and had to be put on something else till I was able to be off the drug.  I am on no drugs today and funtion quite well.  I lost everything dear to me when this happened.  Please think and consider whether you really need drugs or counseling.  If your doctor wants you on this and you actually do need something please use caution and make sure the doctor takes blood tests and monitors your chemicals in your body."

So if you start this medication, make sure you have a back up plan, because if you don't, you can find yourself in a world of hurt. And worse yet, you start becoming unstable again and if like me, other drugs are unable to be taken, well, what can you do.  It's not like good people want to take potentially addictive drugs, the other drugs worked, not without the ""life endangering"" side effects though. It would be great to take them, but I can't. Till then, I'm struggling to find a doctor to get my medication, (Klonopin), which has been working well for years.  If you're not a drug addict, this drug is a life saver."

It works great when I take it as needed, but sometimes I am reluctant to take it at my worst times because I become so anxious I can't think.  But, as soon as I take it (or my fiance gets me to) it works and calms me down fast. I make sure to use it only when I really need it because I have an addictive personality. Even if I am sober, I still have major fears, but I need to realize that when I take it for the right reasons it WORKS!

used it for bipolar and panic attacks.
it wiped out all long and short term memory for about the last 
30 years. i just don't remember anything from before i started it to when i stopped.i effectably lost 30 years of my life!

it also made me gain weight-at least 85 pounds.

i became so forgetful that i was continually looking for everything, even something i had just had in my hand(sometimes it was in the other hand).

i was tired ALL the time and spent a good part of my days in bed. at least that is what my dr. and my charts say (i just don't remember).

it didn't take away the panic attacks or the manic or depressive episodes. i have been on many drugs (perscription only) and i would NEVER use it again. there are other drugs that work MUCH better.

the reason i gave it 3 stars is because i couldn't give it less. it destroyed my life! am now on other drugs that work so well that i wouldn't consider this drug for any reason!"

My doctor believes that my daughter may also be bipolar because she has been diagnosed with ADHD and he states that many younger children with bipolar get misdiagnosed with adhd due to the similarities of the two and the age.  well since I have been on this medication I have been doing wonderful.  about the first week I felt as though I just could not function but once I got passed that week my life really did take a whole different direction.  people just need to discuss there issues with there doctor and stick with the program.  That is what they get paid the big bucks for.  If you feel as though your doctor is not treating you in the manner that you feel is appropriate for your situation, then find a second opinion.  I have been battling this for over 10 years now and I have just recently found the right doctor that actually listens to what I tell him is wrong and how my medications make me feel and he takes the time to explain to me what I should be feeling and tells me to let him know if they dont go away.  The right doctor makes all the difference.

I was switched to Klonopin and for me it works perfectly. I have had very few panic attacks. I do not get high from it like the Xanax. It is just an even feeling that both helps my panic disoorder and helps with the manic side of Bipolar. I personally have not had depression increase of suicidal thoughts but have known people who have so talk to your doctor. Everypne is different and this is addictive so never just stop taking it. I had to once as a psychiatrist ""fired"" me and did not wean me down and I was amess for three months and could have died I was later told. I take 6mg per day. 3 doses of 2 mg. Most people need way less than that so talk to your doctor. For me though, I am happy with this mediaction and probably will stay on it for life. Again, I like that it never makes me feel high. Some people it may. That is not good. "

When introduced to clonazepam, I was not informed of just how addictive this drug is. clonazepam helped me for years but after a while made me very suicidal. My doctor and I are now working closely together to taper me off of clonazepam. I have replaced the clonazepam with Librium which is a long lasting benzodiazepine for the slow taper from clonazepam. The taper will take 3 months and then I will have to taper off of the Librium which is much less addictive than the clonazepam. My reason for this comment is in no way to inform anyone about their form of treatment for their condition. Rather, it is to warn anyone of just how addictive clonazepam is and how difficult it is to get off of. Good luck to all and may God bless you!

I have been on clonazepam for 20 years. The drug helped me for years but ended up making me very suicidal. My physician and I are working closely together now on a very slow taper to get off of clonazepam. The taper requires a replacement drug to get off of it. I am in my third week of the taper replacing the clonazepam with Librium which is another benzodiazepine which is much easier to get off from than clonazepam. This taper will take 3 months. Then I have to be slowly tapered off of the Librium. When I was introduced to clonazepam, I was never told just how addictive it is. While I would never try to interfere with anyone's treatment, I would DEFINATELY caution anyone given clonazepam to be extremely careful because it is extremely addictive and extremely difficult to get off of. My whole reason for making this comment is to let the reader know just what they are getting into by taking this drug. It does work but is extremely addictive. Good luck and may God bless you all!

I'm not constantly pacing and my facial tics have gotten better, still get them but not as often. And this drug even helps out with my chronic muscle spasms due to mild scoliosis (lateral curvature of the spine). The only side effect, i'm noticing is minor memory loss.I seem to forget things alot lately such as remembering names, phone numbers...etc but it's nothing too alarming.The bottom line is this drug does wonders (Psychotropic-wise)and,in my opinion, safer and better than any SSRI.

And do not stay on this stuff for more than 2 months or less.  You will be fighting off really bad withdrawal symptoms rather than getting relief.  I am sorry I ever took my Doctor's advice  and started taking this drug.  Clonazapam is one of the strongest benzodiazapine along with Xanax (per the ASHTON MANUAL) and for long time users it can take a year to taper off (per the ASHTON MANUAL).  Please take as little as you can."

Whereas it once had a calming effect it now has a ""stimulant"" reaction.  Dr. wants me to stop it now.  Tapering off has been a nightmare. The whole withdrawal things are felt in 12 to 24 hours for me and just get worse. I wish I never heard of this stuff.
Reports on getting off this stuff gradually report that it can take up to a year, with some withdrawal effects remaining with you the whole time. It is clear I have a high tolerance now to Clonazapam and all I am taking it for is to stop the withdrawal symptoms.  So ... 5 years later, my Doc. decides he wants me off it. Five years!
I think I will not make it. Depression/Anxiety has been to long and I hurt physically and mentally. I will try to see if I can take this horrible stuff for the rest of my life.
I may have to cause going off it, I've been told it can cause life threatening events such as seizures that don't stop without major medical intervention ... like getting all kinds of drugs IV to stop the seizures before you die or worse, suffer brain damage.
If you are on this drug, get off it within a month or two ... or you will become addicted. Then you are lost, as I suspect I will be if I can't take small doses for life. "

However, keep in mind, it is moderately addictive, which means you will go through about three or so weeks of withdrawal, which I can tell you, is not pleasant. Also, keep in mind you may have to change doctors some day, and he/she more than likely will change every medication you take.

I do not think it is at all addictive.  I can take it when I need it and leave it when I dont.  The dr says I should take it 4xs a day, but I feel this is a bit much. Rarely do I ever need it 3xs a day.  I usually take it for bed because I have Restless Leg Syndrome as well as full blown Panic Attacks.  I also have Fibromyalgia, which I take a low dose pain pill for each morning & sometimes in the afternoon.

It has no effect on me. It does not calm me down or make me feel better. Is there any other nerve medication out there to where it will not zone me out because I have 3 kids I have to raise alone. I need something to help settle my nerves and help me from anxiety because my bipolar medication isn't worth using either. I have found I have more headaches and grouchy when this medicine wears off but has no effect for what it is prescribed for. I would rather not even take it since it doesn't help relieve my symptoms I need it for.

I can see from the reviews on here that most people are satisfied with the out come, but, when it wears off, which is usually with an hour or so, I crash into an emotional rampage. This didn't work for me.

The only problem is my dependency on this drug. If you dont take it constantly, you are going to have a huge problem. But when taken regularly, which i do, it works miracles.
