10$Bipolar Disorder in Remission$8/14/2012 1:43:59 AM$Reviewer: BipolarVet, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$1$I am taking 25 mg per night to address the manic part of my bipolar disorder.  Even at such a low dosage, it makes me very drowsy and it's hard to get started in the morning.  On average, I sleep between 10-12 hours a day with clozapine, when I used to sleep more like 7-8 hours.  Also, I have to have quite frequent blood tests to make sure my white cell count is not too low from the clozapine.  However, in spite of all these negatives, I still am glad to be on it because it has helped me remain stable and avoid hospitalizations for the past year and 8 months.

CVS pharmacy will not release Cloapine to me unless they too get a copy of my weekly blood levels.

23$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$7/9/2009 2:08:32 AM$Reviewer: Mia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$1$My 42 yr old son had paronoid bipolar and was on clozapine for l6 days.  He wasn't even suicicidal.  He died on the l6th day of being on clozapine. He died of a heart attack.   I say take this horrible drug off the market.  It kills people.  He was healthy before he started taking clozapine.  I blame the doctor for putting him on it when he wasn't even suicidal.  There were other drugs he could have put him on.  Now we lost out beautiful 42 yr old son.
