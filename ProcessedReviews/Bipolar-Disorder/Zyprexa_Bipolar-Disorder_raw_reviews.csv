When starting Zyprexa, I first started sleeping like most people instead of the terrible insomnia I used to have, and without a hangover.  Also, I immediately noticed my racing mind slowing down and thinking became much more controlled.

Interestingly I stopped having bruxism.  I initially gained weight, but that got under control now by avoiding carbs where possible.  My mind is not racing with random or ruminating thoughts.  I still would have some depression, but less frequently, and that was brought under control with 300 mg lithium added.  I don't feel suicidal or, at the other extreme, do foolish things associated with mania.  I now look back on my life as a manic person almost out of control and know that that won't happen anymore.

Also, Eli Lilly has made this drug available to me at no charge since I have little income.  How wonderful all this is!"

My 75 yr old mother began taking Zyprexa 2 yrs ago and at the time it was amazingly successful.  It still is...somewhat.  Several months ago she began having tremors and they are progressively worse now.  She has also developed diabetes, diabetes related heard disease, has had seizures (had the disorder prior), high cholesterol ... but hasn't gained a pound. I am terribly concerned because some of the precautions I have read online indicate the tremors may not subside after stopping the meds.  You would think she had Parkinsons (and may - MRI pending). 

I am terrified to take her off Zyprexa because of her state of mind.  But, I'm also terrified to leave her on the drug.  It's a double edge sword for me.  I think some people will do well on this drug...but others will not.  Everyone has to try it for themselves.  Best of luck to everyone.    "

456$Bipolar Disorder in Remission$1/24/2009 9:50:30 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$3$my doctor diagnosed me with bipolar disorder which i feel is incorrect. I started off with a small dose (this has been over a year ago) then worked up to the (i believe) 25 mg tablet. I gained over 40 pounds in about 3 months, I slept about 14 hours a day. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't clean my house or play with my son. I had NO energy, it was all I could do to just get up in the morning to go to work. My work performance dropped tremendously, but I couldn't help it. I was severly over medicated and didn't even notice until I took myself off the med. I will not allow my doctor to put me on anything else now because I am terrified that this will happen again with something else. I will deal with my problems on a day to day basis now. I would not recommend this medication to anyone but hopefully someone else would not have to deal with this. As for the weight gain as soon as I came off the med I lost back down to my normal size, so I know this was from the zyprexa.

I take the Zydis form which is supposed to have you gain less weight.   I take a low dose   5 mg at nights.  It has really helped with my anxiety, and makes me sleep great.   I used to wake up 2 or 3 times a night. Whenever I woke up I would have to get up and check on my kids to make sure they were all right.  Otherwise I would not be able to get back to sleep.  I'd just lie there worrying.   With the the Zyprexa I sleep through the night.

I cannot use my hands for any fine motor skills and I have involuntary spasms in my back and neck just on this low dosage! I want to get off desperatley but cannot because I need to sleep.

I've had my ups and downs, but overall I have been able to lead a normal life.  Through faith in God and through reading the Bible I have been blessed to obtain a Bachelor's Degree and maintain regular employment with the government. Things haven't always been easy. I've gained alot of weight, but the weight I've gained is minor in comparison to the life I've been able to live. I have also been blessed to not get diabetes. Sometimes things are so good for me that if a person didn't know me personally, they would never know that I had the disease.  God has been so good to me. I recommend Jesus for every situation.  If you trust Him, He will make it better.  God Bless.

Side effects are always a problem and I have gone thru this ""torture"" of not sleeeping for years!!!  I am VERY ""medication sensitive.""  I feel disappointed with this new development.

In every way shape or form, i DO NOT recommend this drug by any means. It worsened my depression by making me sleep all hours of the day & gained 50 pounds in 6 months. I was always a tiny petite person until I started taking that. I recommend to try & live with your disorder without medication. Zyprexa made me feel emotionless, almost like a robot. I stopped taking it about a year ago and right around March I had finally lost the unnecessary 50 pounds I had put on. If you desperately need medication, go to abilify or zoloft.. NOT zyprexa.

over and against what i previously took. In a matter of a month i saw a change in manic episodes, no more racing thoughts and felt calmer. The depression has seemed to lesson too. That was about eight years ago. In that time i have gained over 50 pounds when i was always proper weight before and i noticed i am tired more often ,so i take it at night. Went from 10 mg to 5mgs once a day before bed. I am noticing more manic episodes creeping in.

350$Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$1/16/2010 1:44:23 AM$Reviewer: hazeldeluxe, 25-34 Female  (Patient) $1$1$4$Taking this medication was the most awful experience I ever had, it was the first rx I was given after the diagnosis of Bipolar.  I had been on antidepressants for most of my life starting in 7th grade all to no avail, so when I got the diagnosis of the more severe mental illness, I was actually relieved.  So I started the program and continued the full course to make sure I gave it a fair chance to have the desired effect. I was at work one day and the thought crossed my mind that I might want to kill myself but I blew it off, then the idea came back and I started to take it serious like planning my demise. I've struggled with stuff most of my life and wished I was dead but I never would've taken my own life, because I actually have always had a nice life.  I think there is a difference between wanting to die and planning a suicide.  Zyprexa completely rewired my brian, I stayed on it for 4 months. I was on suicide watch and was moments away from being checked into the psych ward, my friends were genuinely concerned, in a way they had never been before. I became a different person entirely.  The doctor that gave me the script was a quack but that is another story.  Taking this med is my very biggest regret still today. The only good thing is that I am back to normal, except when I have a flashback, usually around the time of year, the anniversary, of the disaster.

It was a little rough at first. Made me a little slugish.  I was taking 7.5mg a day.  It worked really well for me but I had to stop because I gained almost 40lbs in less than two months!  I was really fit, so it was very obvious that I gained it.  Plus everyone felt the need to tell me how chunky I had become. Plus that much weight so fast is not healthy.  I really wish it didn't have that side effect because it worked pretty good.  After a few other meds that didn't work, I am currently on Seroquel 400mg. It didn't make me gain weight at first at smaller doses, but they weren't effective. But now at 400 I've gained almost 40lbs in the last three months. I gained alot on Zyprexa, then lost it all on Geodon (worst one I've ever been on!)  But now I'm back up to where I left off with Zyprexa.  I do feel better, but I can't deal with the gain. I will be discussing this at my next appointment. But all in all the Zyprexa was great other then that side effect.

I'm now on Zyprexa,4 days at 2.5, now starting 4 days on 5 mg.  This is my last try, then I'd be repeating meds. again. What I don't understand why give me a pill which you gain weight. I feel the drs. have run out of options, and don't listen to me about gaining weight on meds. I don't want a pill that makes you eat all the time. When I got off Depakote and all the bloat went away, and I wanted to eat right and excercise.  Then the weight gain pills come and what weight I lost and felt normal were gone in a few days. I want to toss all ths out, but my sleeping is bad and I need something."

Although it lessen the anxiety and panic attacks, the side-effects became intolerable.  I slept sometimes as much as 14 hours a day at times and my appetite became something out of control.  I was eating like a starving dog and I gained 75 pounds in less than a year,  my blood pressure went up, and I was retaining water which caused me to have a bloated and shiny-skinned appearance. I have a photo from back then and I looked very un-well.  But I kept on it because my doctor said there was nothing in that class of drugs which I hadn't been already on and had experienced unacceptable side-effects.  Si I took it.  Then late last year the panic attacks and all of the rest of the nightmare came crashing on top of me. I felt psychotic and terrified of what I might do to myself. I had to make an emergency appointment with my doctor and I was in hospital within the hour.  I was weaned off the zyprexa and in hospital for nearly a month.  I am finally beginning to lose the excess weight.  I am on enirely different medication.  Every medication is not the same for everyone, I know, but I don't recommend zyprexa.

It works very quickly - the first day I took it, I started sleeping through the night. Racing and negative thoughts filtered out. My comment is, Zyprexa trumps everything - I always know I can take a full dose and the black pit of despair will close up almost instantly.  Having said that, it has significant side effects. Weight gain and tiredness are the main ones. It's sort of a Catch-22 since those things are rather depressing in and of themselves. I've been on it for about 15 years though and while the side effects are still an issue, they are more manageable. It increases sugar cravings, which makes staying on a healthy diet hard, but it is possible. (Weight Watchers diet has worked for me.). Because it's so powerful, I have been able to reduce the dose for periods of time, with reductions in weight and tiredness issues, but I have never been able to come all the way off it.  I guess I have a love-hate relationship with it. But if I'm depressed, I gain weight and feel sluggish anyway, so I'm no worse off.  For me, this drug was a miracle, but you need to be able to maintain a healthy diet and exercise, because the cravings

Medication was very effective within 2-3 days. On reflection my major side effect was mild/moderate depression. Continued medication for 1 1/2 years until moving out of state.

Was then rediagnosed Bipolar and was recommended to switch medications to a combination of Depakote and Citalopram. I reluctantly made the switch eventually without trouble.

Since then I have had one instance when severe stress has allowed the manic phase to 'leak through'. I was again given Olanzapine and the manic symptoms disappeared immediately. I was able to discontinue Olanzapine within 1-2 weeks.

My psychiatrist and I now use Depakote as the background medication for the manic phase and on any indication of returning manic symptoms we use Olanzapine as a temporary 'brake' with great effectiveness."

216$Manic-Depression$3/9/2012 1:54:51 PM$Reviewer: bipolar guppie, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$3$5$I have been taking zyprexa for over ten years for bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms.  In the beginning it helped me tremendously and helped me to maintain a steady job and life for about 7 years on the drug.  I did not put on the weight gain that others seem to have a problem with.  However, please note that it makes you want to sleep 10-12 hours a day and if I got any less than that during the night I would have to make up for it with a 2-3 hour nap in the afternoon or evening!  Recently I had to stop taking zyprexa since it seems to not be working anymore to manage my bipolar symptoms.  Even worse, I think it has exacerbated sleep apnea syndrome where I am not able to breathe properly or at all for periods of time at night, which makes me wake up in the middle of the night for many many moments at a time.  This really wreaks havoc on your sleep cycle and sleep quality!  Overall, I would say that try this medication if you must of if your psychiatrist recommends this but beware of the long-term side effects that they may not be too aware of and may not be published when this drug was first released to the public.  Hope this helps!
226$Manic-Depression$11/19/2011 3:09:18 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$2$1$I began taking this drug after my first manic episode. It helped me deal with my depression but I hated my life while I was on it. I had to get 10 hours of sleep or I would not be able to function. The first day my dose was too strong and I slept for 30 hours. I fixed my dose but I still gained an annoying amount of weight. But honestly the worst part was planning my entire life around when I would be able to basically pass out for 10 hours. It is good for dire crisis situations. When I got off it I had a suicidal episode and felt completely worthless. Worse than any of the lows in my depression. Again I would not take this drug unless you need a quick boost to get your life back on track.

I have had no side effects and the medication has worked well with my other medications.  I would also strongly recommend that often times have to give psychiatric drugs 8-12 weeks before they reach a therapeutic level to even work, so give them a chance.  Additionally, don't expect everything from your medications; you should also be involved in counseling and group therapy for an adequate time ( I still go regularly to a psychiatrist and to a therapist) to better help you understand whatever disorder you've been diagnosed with and help you cope with the challenges that go along with it.

My mood changed immediately and I started running three miles every day (it had been over two years since I did any regular exercise and never enjoyed it), became more talkative and outgoing, and had a new hope for my life.  Unfortunately, it only took one month for me to gain a quick 23 pounds!  Four years later and still struggling with a variety of pills, I tried it again.  Again, I felt the best, but gained another 19 lbs. in three weeks.  It's three years later and I have yet to lose the weight or find something that works as well.

Since, he has lost 40 pounds and sleeps all day and is restless at night. He has diabetes and his sugar is all messed up, vision problems, tremors, nervous agitation, depressed badly to the point of constantly talking about suicide. His dose is small and 1x @ night. He felt better before taking this medicine and I have noticed his well being sinking rapidly. His doctor still feels this is the best medicine for him. I disagree. Time for a new doctor before this one kills my man.

I was slightly overweight (160) when I started taking this drug. Lately, I gained 65 lbs. My doctor put me on Lasix to get the water weight off. I initially lost 11 lbs., but I fear that I can't get any more of the weight off. With my many health problems, I decided to stop taking Zyprexa, tapering it down slowly. I can't risk my life any more than it already is. The swelling, or pitting it is called by the Medical Professional, is very dangerous.  So, I WILL NOT EVER take this medication again, even though it helped my Manic Depression. Good luck to all of you.

It has helped me to fall asleep and helped me to stay asleep.  Less mania and easing of intense depression over time.  Trying to wean doseing is horrible and confusing and I now realize I am totally dependent on the drug to function every day.  The 30 pounds I gained has been bothersome to say the least, but tight monitoring of my diet has eased the weight some.

It causes kids to cut themselves and want to harm themselves.  I have seen too many children in the hospital with medicines that don't work and they have such bad side effects on them they should be banned unless they can prove they help and individual.  I want to warn parents alot of kids can't handle these drugs.  Make sure your doctor really knows your kids before they put medicine in them and don't let them try high doses.  Go to the health food store first and see if it works because I have seen improvement when my son tried vitamins but there has never been a good medicine that has done anything but make my son worse.

426$Manic-Depression$4/21/2009 2:38:44 PM$Reviewer: caution, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) $2$2$1$These medicines should not be used on children under the age of 25, they have too many side effects and most kids do not really know if they work.  They do not solve depression and they experience all the bad side effects going on the medicine and the frightening withdrawl symptoms that are sucidal.  I do not recommend any anti-depressant drugs for kids unders the age of 20 and highly think people should try homopathic medicine first.  They don't have the side effects antidepressants have and they are very dangerous and suicide is one of the dangerous side effects we have expereienced.

I just about went out of my mind obcessing about everything, and my racing mind just about threw me into psychotic spins almost every nite.I went back on at the 2.5mg dose.

5mg, 10mg and 20mg over time.  It became a nightmare! 
That is the one ""benefit?"" I did get, was solid sleep; I became almost semi comatose in addition to quickly gaining
50 lbs on my 5'5"" body resulting in a deepening of my depression & several serious suicide attempts. Zyprexa IS helpful in individual cases,but not mine.

I started to educate myself and advocate for myself, became a partner in my treatment.  

I still take medications, always will. I've had one suicidal attempt while off Zyprexa, my weight is an acceptable 145 lbs and most of the time I am living a reasonably good, tolerable and informed life.

Don't give up hope!  Don't stop taking your meds! Don't stop learning! It's your responsible way of finding out about yourself & what fits you best plus how to express it! Defend your right to know about your health care treatment, it is imperative.

I didn't mean to lecture.  I felt it necessary to tell my story, in and out of symtoms, with and without Zyprexa. It led me on my path of discovery in my own health treatment and remissions. 

I'm so thankful!      "

The combination made me feel heinous: worthless, emotionless, apathetic.   Although, Zyprexa itself was given to me to aid sleep... which it did... a little too well.  I would caution to try diet and exercise first! I don't take any medication now, and I stopped myself.  Training and nutrition has taken care of the problems.
