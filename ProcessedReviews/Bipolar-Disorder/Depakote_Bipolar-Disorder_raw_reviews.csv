8$Bipolar Depression$8/25/2016 8:27:16 PM$Reviewer: Anish1979 , 35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$4$I was misdiagnosed for over 15 years with docs always saying it was just depression. I have bipolar with depression, anxiety, ADHD, agoraphobia, and on top of all that Fibromyalgia. When I was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder my doc tried many different meds, but I had severe reactions to all of them. The first med that worked was Lithium. I got my labs done and never had too much in my blood, but ended up losing over half my hair and gaining over 100 pounds! I weaned myself off of the Lithium and doc put me on Depakote/Divalprox ER. I lost 140 pounds in 6 months and got all my hair back. I take Cymbals, Valium, Ritalin, and Gabapentin as well. I felt like a new person, mild depression, mood swings much better, and rage/psycho feeling episodes were better. I have had to teach myself to avoid confrontations and other situations though. Grogginess in morning has always been there, could be meds for Fibromyalgia. Overall this mixture of meds has been a lifesaver! I am so glad to not feel like a lab rat anymore!

13$Bipolar Depression$10/22/2015 11:11:39 AM$Reviewer: Urban Cowboy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$3$This was the first drug I took.  It did nothing for me.  Lithium was next added, plus Cipralex, and Latuda.  Now I'd like to get rid of the Divalproex, since it had no effect from the beginning.  Makes sense, right?
31$Bipolar Depression$1/8/2014 12:16:19 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Divalproex is the third bipolar med I've tried, and it's the first that doesn't feel like a complete waste of money. I do get some slight tremors after my morning dose, but that's the only side effect I've experienced (my liver function's actually improved since I switched from lithium). There's a definite difference in my mood, too -- I'm far less irritable and edgy on divalproex than I felt on lithium or Lamictal, and it works fast enough to help prevent my bad moods from escalating.

43$Bipolar Depression$7/2/2013 11:25:45 AM$Reviewer: Tibby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$1$3$I have not had good experiences from the beginning. I'm not one to complain, so at first I just ignored the side effects because I wanted my moods to be stable, after multiple drug trials and being hospitalized from the bad reactions to other drug trials. I first started with 250mgs in the mornings, it caused me to become very shaky, nauseous and loss of appetite. The headaches were nothing; anyone should expect headaches when you’re trying to stable neurons in the brain. My Psychiatrist told me to start taking it at night time, that went well, so he increased the dose to 500mgs. Then I started experiencing some grogginess in the morning. I was extremely upset because I'm a morning person, I literally LIVE for mornings. Anyways, because I'm also ADD, the doctor prescribed me Vyvance for the morning and my mornings are back! (Vyvance is a whole other story - but I only take it when I absolutely need it because I find my body gets immune to it if I take it every day - I skip weekends - I'm a college student) So now after 6 months of taking it, my I find it help me tolerate a lot more and balance my moods. The only problem is now I’m starting to have side effects, such as abdominal pain, back pain, tiredness, nausea and vomiting. I know it’s because of my medication because I missed a dose the other night and my symptoms weren’t as bad the next day. I’m actually at work in the middle of nowhere, so I’m jumping on the plane tomorrow to see the Doctor. I found this medication worked, but too bad for the side effect.

Have had more mood swings, bad  hand tremors, bad hair loss, gained weight, my right eye twitches, I have irregular hear rhythms now. Needless to say more of a mess than I was before. And my doctor says the benefit to me is greater than the risk of side effects of the medication yup great. That is why I stopped taking it.

I couldn't get too sad (which was good), but I also couldn't get happy. I wouldn't say ""zombie"" feeling, but just ""coasting"" through life. The initial side effects were pretty severe irritability and increased appetite, these went away after about a week but every time my mg's got increased I had to go through these side effects again. Quit taking it after about 7 months. "

I AM ON IT FOR BIPOLOR DEPRESSION AND I CAN TELL SOME DIFFERENCE. I HAVE BEEN ON DEPAKOTE ER 500MG, PROZAC 40MG, CYMBALTA 60MG AND OUT OF THESE 3 MEDICATIONS IT SEEMS LIKE THE PROZAC HELPED THE BEST, I GO BACK TO MY PHYSICIAN IN ONE WEEK AND SHE TOLD ME AT MY LAST APPT. THAT SHE MAY KEEP ME ON THE DEPAKOTE ER AND ALSO ADD A SMALL DOSE OF PROZAC, SO I HOPE IF SHE ADS THE PROZAC TO THE DEPAKOTE ER IT WILL WORK A LITTLE BETTER BUT MAYBE YOU HAVE TO GIVE THIS DRUG (DEPAKOTE ER) A LITTLE MORE TIME TO WORK LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO WITH ALL ANIT-DEPRESSENTS. ALSO I DIDNT LIKE BEING ON THE CYMBALTA BECAUSE WHEN THEY TOOK ME COMPLETLEY OFF OF IT IT GAVE ME FEELINGS OF LIKE ELECTRICAL SHOCKS IN MY BRAIN AND MY PHYSICIAN TOLD ME THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY TAKE YOU COMPLETLEY OFF OF CYMBALTA INSTEAD OF WEANING YOU OFF OF IT.

I did the whole health class that tells you to whatch what you eat that wasn't it. it was the meds.. I know it because when I took myself off I lost 22 pounds in less than a month without diet or exercise.. So you may get to a point when you are torn.
I had to choose to live and be a lil off balance than to make all my doctors happy and stay medicated.I think this a great med but the sideeffect were devistating I have more health problems then my grandmother and I fight with my ups and downs but I try to walk myself through it to know that what ever I am feeling at the moment will pass.I will not always be UP or Drown for too long a period and with this in mind I never crash to hard on my lows..

Like peeing all night so couldn't get but 2-3 hours solid sleep dr prescribed med to help bladder control and sleeper instead of getting off lithium. none of the other meds worked by the way.  so the last 4 years very sleep deprived. you can imagine what that does to a persons mood and personality let alone being bipolar.fatigue, muscle aches , hair loss all from lithium.  Maybe a little thinning so far from the depakote, hard to tell but being a woman it's not a real plus.  by the way my dr wanted me to continue on the lithium even though my thyroid got way out of wack  and I kept saying something was prompting me to get off of it onto something different.  so i had to be my own patient advocate and push.  just remember your dr is not god, talk to others, get a second opinion if needed, bring someone with to appointments.

I highly suggest reading the printout before taking this drug and strongly recommend getting off of this drug as soon as you can if you can; BUT please don't suddenly stop taking this medication it could lead to fatal long lasting seizures."

267$Bipolar Depression$2/13/2012 7:56:29 AM$Reviewer: Julie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$3$I have been taking Depakote for approx 2 years. At first I took Depakote in the morning, which resulted in me not being able to function during the day.I discussed this with my psychiatrist who advised me to take my medication before going to bed.This has worked well, I sleep better and funtion ok during the day - sometimes feeling a little tired.I take Depakote, Fluoxetine and sometimes Propanolol for anxiety.Depakote suits me and my mind is very much calmer with no racing thoughts and I am more able to keep things in perspective.I am now able to get myself to the gym - which helps greatly with my moods.I would recommend Depakote, but,I do appreciate that what I have read in other reviews that it is definitely not for every one.I began to begin feeling the benefits of Depakote a month after starting it.I no longer get crazy mood swings, so for me this drug works well - although I am concerned about its toxicity levels etc.Now that I am feeling more balanced I combine my drugs with eating healthily and getting lots of excercise.This is a massive improvement as I used to suffer from low self esteem and lack of confidence. I hope that if you try Depakote that it works as well for you as  it has for me. I now have far more good days than bad.

Found out recently that I've lost some of my memory, have many nervous system issues and as of yesterday my ammonia levels in my blood are toxic from the medication. For mentally stability the medication is a great help however there are risk. I was told I was to have an MRI and EEG done as well to see what kind of damage has been done to the brain from possible swelling. Do you research. If your on the medication please make sure your doctor is ordering all the proper blood work and note that ammonia levels must be put on ice to get a correct reading.

It took a good 4 months to take full affect.  The only issue that caused me to go off it was weight gain.  I am a personal trainer, i work out 6 days a week and eat healthy and i still gained weight and was unable to take it off.

294$Bipolar Depression$8/15/2011 4:40:17 PM$Reviewer: veryvermilion, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$"I started taking this drug 6 weeks ago.  I was ready for weight gain, but the opposite has happened.  I no longer find myself craving fatty, starchy, fried foods.  
The other side effect that I was shocked to have is a marked increase in my libido.  I feel like a 20 year old.
I do not like feeling so drowsy.  It has slowed down my overall system so much.  I can't get up and going until about 2pm or later.  For years I was up and out of bed by 7am or earlier.  I am considering reintroducing caffeine to my diet.  With years of anxiety, I stopped using caffeine.  Now with this medication, I'm thinking that maybe a little will help me to get going earlier in the day.  
Also it has my slowed my GI system.  I'm not constipated, I just am not as ""regular"" as I was prior to the drug.  I'm taking fiber supplement and eating tons of veggies/fruit to combat this side effect.
It's helped with my terrible anger problems.  I'm not nearly as obnoxious on the road as I used to be.  
It amazes me at how different every one's response to Depakote is.  It just goes to show that we're all unique.  
I feel very lucky to have found this medication.  I just hope I can combat the drowsiness and GI problems."

Doctors should not just prescribe this med to teens without monitoring side effects. Could never wake up in the morning. Felt like I was walking through fog.  Side effects robbed me of two years of my life - I can barely remember them because of this drug.  It's several years later - I have had great success off medication and have been able to manage depression with diet, exercise, and lots of work. It isn't easy but consider if the drug is adding more symptoms than its relieving if it isn't working. Ask to stop.

He was sent home and retested two days later and his range was 6248 - under 100 being normal.  We saw a pediatric specialist today and his liver is swollen two times the normal size and he had additional blood tests and if the levels have not gone down he will be admitted inpatient today.

My first phychiatrist put me on 1000 mg. Depakote.  He continually monitored my liver enzymes (liver failure in Depakote).  Since then, I have been on Depakote, but recent elevation of liver enzymes caused by MD to stop.  I felt my mood go down the tube and am waiting for blood tests to be taken Monday.  My only real issue that I have incurred with Depakote is a loss of balance, which previously had been perfect; however, being of late on only 250 mg, my balance is unaffected.  Now the company is offering a $50.00 coupon to use since generic divalproex has been introduced.  One week on the generic I became confused and agitated.  I've never been suicidal, but Depakote is the one drug for me!"

393$Bipolar Depression$8/21/2010 3:54:54 AM$Reviewer: SFWII, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$After several attempts at finding the right med. for BPII depression, my psych. started me on an aggresive course of Depakote, while watching lvls. and careful controlling of med. prescribing times, with ample warnings to me and careful consideration unto my situation.  Being that I have BPII, my depressive side can get severely out of control also and I have tried so many of the newer, or better, anti-depressants on this,sometimes, ridiculous market of psychiatric medications.  These meds. would only bump me up into a manic-type state and always leave me worse in the long run.  Depakote seemed to be the ONLY  answer we could agree on and I have remained on it for possibly 20 years now.  Only on an extreme occasion, would another anti-deppresive be ordered, only to fail, in the short course of sometimes, days. So, basically, we,ve remained with Depakote thoughout the long-haul of BPII depression.  Sorry to be so run-on, but it's been over two decades working with this medication unto ongoing treatment.   Depakote can help to control symptoms, offer stabillaty where allowed and offer quite few side-effects, in the more, short-term usage.  That is as far as I am concerned.  I would have to say GOOD CHOICE, sometimes the older ones may be the better ones, all things considered.  One more thought, if I may, be SURE to work closely with your' Dr. concerning long-term usuage, such as with my case, as this is imperative for psycho/somatic health.  Teamwork is so important concerning your overall health, choose your' Dr. wisely, He/She will be working best with you when all bases are covered unto prescribing Depakote and any testing of it that should be involved.

I was nervous about taking depakote since I heard it makes you tired, and with taking my other meds, I can't afford to be any more tired!  But my doc insisted I try it, since Prozak just made me suicidal and even crazier.  The one side effect I seem to notice is that, instead of making me tired, it does the opposite - seems to cancel out the sleeping effect of the ativan!!  It's been a rough couple of days, with having to work a full time job and take care of my family on almost no sleep.  Id like to know if anyone else is having the same problem???

My body got use to the dose and the doctor increased the dose. I immediatly noticed joint and muscle pain, and a pain running from my abdomin through my right testicle to about a 6"" down my leg. I backed off the drug and it no longer had the same effect. On the good side I had no emotions, no fear, no remourse, no cares when people die, it made me laugh at pain, when people got injured, when people fall down stairs,ect. I eventually dropped off and went on lithium. ""DO NOT TAKE LITHIUM"" look at the side effects. Now I have problems with my thyroid from Lithium. I'm dropping lithium and going back on depakote in the hopes my thyroid will function properly concidering I just started Lithium!"

But for me Depakote is one of (I believe 1--13) drugs I've taken for my bipolar disorder that has helped.  But it deft. does make you gain weight but not as much as I thought. All the meds over the past 4 yrs have so I'm battling it on my own.
Also -I read it's good for ppl who get headaches? Well ever since begining my frequent headaches have become daily. I'm currently recieveing accupunture for relief. And I've had hair loss which I believe is a result of this drug. But overall I believe it's helped. But I also give myself credit because I go to therapy on a regular basis andreally try to control my moods the best I can. So it's hard to tell what's making the difference. I kinda don't believe in any of the psych meds...that's a whole nother story"

I have since had to come off of it due to hair loss. I am only 42 and was literally loosing too much hair!
It worked wonders with me and my mood swings. Me and my boyfriend got along wonderfully but now I'm taking another pill and I can tell a difference. I'm basically back to my moody self and hate it. 
I have a re-check next week. I only wish Depakote didn't have that one major side effect. Now I need to start growing some of that hair back! :(

We tried lots of different meds (Geodon,which was very very scary!!! Abilify-which did not stop the voices, and currently on Seroquel-which is working great!) but the one consistant med has been the Depakote.  500mg in the AM and 750mg in the PM, and it has been wonderful at keeping her fairly stable mood wise, no more massive manic ups and downs.  The downside to this medication has been the drastic weight gain and some hair loss, but other then that, this drug has definitely made a huge difference in her moods.

All of the side effects from previous drugs made it harder to deal with than bi-polar itself.  Her doctor then had her start depakote last fall and she did well for a month and half so he doubled it..not sure why. Then she started having the shakes real bad and would be dizzy and stmbled into to things. We were so worried she would break a hip. The doctor pulled her off of it for a couple weeks then started her back to original dose and she's do better. She still tends to feel a little loopy from the meds...but we all agree (her included) that is better than the ups and downs of bi-polar. Treating any depression is so tricky as everyone's body chemistry is different. It takes patience and love and a very good support system for folks suffering.  God bless anyone who has a loved one or is dealing with this themselves.

It has worked very well for me.  I have to say that it has worked extremely well now that I am also on Geodon in conjunction with it.  I went through several psychiatrists before I found this one who has been wonderful in listening to me and altering my treatment plan to deal with unwanted side effects of other medications.  The main thing that I have not liked about Depakote is the weight gain.  I feel like I'm starving (literally) all the time and have increased appetite because of it.  Overall, though, I would recommend it.  I do believe that if you still have symptoms if on Depakote, ask your doctor because I have NO symptoms at all when coupled with the other mood stabilizer I am on.  I feel happy, healthy, and great!

Depakote combined with adequate nutrition and exercise is the ultimate treatment for my bipolar dis order.People need to realize that medication alone will not provide them the best results. The worst thing about the depakote for me, is occasionally I have very blury vision. People are complaining about the weight gain due to depakote this has not been true for me.Without the sucess of depakote I could not be persuing a nursing career. I simply could not think.I hope it keeps working for me because other treatments have been a real night mare for me. Abilify and Seroquel about made me lose my mind. I was estatic when depakote worked for me!Though all people are different, I highly recomend it. Good luck and don't give up.

The only side effects I have experienced is loss of appetite (very subtle) and a shorter but more efficient sleep pattern. I will only sleep 4-5 hours at a time but feel well rested.

The combination has worked wonders for me. I also did cognitive behavior therapy for the first two years when I was diagnosed to help as well.  I sleep great, laugh, enjoy life, and the anxiety is completely gone.  The Zoloft/ depakote turns off the rapid thoughts like a light switch!  I had hypo mania with more depressive episodes.  The psychiatrist said the anxiety is caused from the rapid cycling.  It feels great to be anxiety free, not worry and be able to handle life as a confident person.  I do occasionally take Xanax when in extremely stressful situations- once every 3-4 months. I exercise daily and eat fairly healthy.  The only IDE effect was gaining about 30 pounds over the last 10 years.  However, I would rather be 30 pounds heavier and not feel depressed, suicidal, anxious, and paralyzed. 
171$Bipolar Disorder in Remission$6/2/2014 12:39:32 PM$Reviewer: irishlass, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I took Lamictal for about 2 1/2 yrs. and still experienced mood swings every four months.  When I crash I become almost completely dysfunctional unable to complete normal daily chores, have no desire to see family or friends, cry often, stay in bed, have anxiety attacks. I become a reverse of the person I am, positive, outgoing, family oriented.  Since taking Depakote generic (Divalproex SOD DR 250 mg.I have not crashed, however I have only been on Depakote since 3/26/14, so it has been app.9 wks (a little over 2 months) and I'm praying I don't crash in another two months.  I began this cycling eight years ago at the age of 59 and Dr.'s did not diagnose me as bi-polar until 3 yrs about 3 yrs. ago though it runs in the maternal side of my family and of my 3 children tow are bi-polar.  It has been a horrible time for my husband & family members & friends who have watched how I crash app. every four months.  I can feel when I am going and then about 3 months later I can actually feel myself coming back to normal.  I'm praying that with the assistance of my new psychiatrist, Depakote, and having a correct diagnosis my mood will stabilize.  That is what I have asked for and prayed for so long.  During the past eight years I have had many Psychiatrist's for many different reasons, most not of my choosing,  and most were quacks, pill pushers, not interested in me or my well being.  I am being completely honest in saying this.

As soon as I was switched to Divalproex which is generic for depakote, I did a complete 180. from what I was on before. I was able to speak, Get out of bed. which prior to resprital & my 4 day manic phase, I had never been so depressed in my life when they put me on resprital. Within the first 3 days I was on divalproex, I started talking again, feeling more energy to get out of the bed & within a couple of weeks I felt more like my self again not completly but more wich gave me hope. I with by the grace of God & complete dedication to my my meds & mental health. I am doing really wellon this medicine considering the disease which I've struggled with now for 9 years, 2 manic episodes that both came with psycosis for more than a year for each one. I have been manic free. I don't like jumping meds so I haven't got to experience alot of them to find out if there is something better than depakote. I am too worried that one will put me in the state that resprital did, but the ones I know that come with bad side effcts are Resprital & Ambilify! So I hope this helps someone. I have Bipolar Mixed! Also great for headaches I rarely get one, & I only take one at night.:)

It seems to keep me from getting more depressed and takes away some symptoms of mania.  I did notice that I am getting a lot slower in my mental abilities so that worries me a lot. I also notice that Depakote has also made my vision worse and seems to be slowing my heart rate.  I hope to keep taking it until my symptoms go away completely but I doubt I will ever live a normal life free from bipolar. I only suggest using Depakote if you are severly bipolar type 2.

Perhaps i will just have to cut my hair short because   i hear Topamax can cause hair loss also.  I used to be in a healthy weight range but now I'm obese, I am so upset now.  The only reason I continuse taking Depakote 1000mg is because with out it I cry so often and also become angry and irritated so easly.

Almost lost my job because the side effects were effecting my work. I quit taking Depakote on my own, by tapering off of it for about 5 days. Do NOT stop taking this drug cold turkey! The withdrawal side effects are very bad. Worst drug I have ever taken in my life and I have taken many drugs in the years I have dealt with bipolar disorder.

Both my psychiatrist and I believe I don't need to be on divalproex any longer, so I have been reducing from 750mg since mid-July. So far so good, I am down to 500mg, and will begin reducing again next week. I have not had a manic episode in over a year, which is one reason why I am discontinuing the meds, but I also don't know the full effect of the drug on my system, so I'd rather be off than playing russian roulette with my organs. I would recommend this drug, as I was taking Lithium and was still cycling fairly often.

The first Psychiatrist I saw prescribed this to me.  I have had my name CLEARED by other Psychiatrist, confirming that I do not even have Bipolar Disorder.
As for this medication, this is absolutely garbage.  It causes intense weight gain, hair loss, and dulling of emotions.  When you take this, you can't remember things as well either, and all creativity is lost.  What's worse is, that when taken, it only works temporarily, and then you have to keep increasing the dosage because your body gets used to it.  Don't take this medication."

450$Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$3/2/2010 2:57:28 AM$Reviewer: Moi,  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $1$1$1$I was on this drug for quite a few years as a child and teenager. It didn't solve any problems but in my case it caused muscular degeneration. When I complained about how weak I felt, the Doctors attributed it to symptoms of the Bipolar and didn't take me seriously. It progressed into bed wetting problems, as I no longer had enough muscle control to control my bladder. When I was 18 the damage was so bad I suffered from asthma. I finally had enough, and took myself off medications all together in October of 2002. I hoarded the medications, waiting for a doctor note to show improvement was noted. Once I had it, I told him I wasn't taking medications and successfully forced him to concede that in my case they were causing most of my problems. It has been over 7 years since I have been on drugs. I still have symptoms of Bipolar, but I control it with Meditation. Not Medication. But the muscular degeneration was so bad that I still suffer some of the damage. I only last year recovered controller of my bladder, and this year I am getting back muscle tone around my body. As far as I am concerned, if I continued taking this drug I would be dead now. Instead, I am a home owner with a perfect credit score and I lead a productive and full filling life. I just learned to create goals for myself as a way of dealing with the depression, and use common sense for dealing with the anxiety. No one should take this drug if you feel yourself getting weak.

I was devastated when the psych diagnosed me. The doctor prescribed Depakote and I don't recall looking into the drug prior to ingesting it. I remember experiencing very VIVID dreams. They were quite scary and seemed very real to me. When I brought this to the physician's attention, he informed me, the drug had to be in my system for more than 2 weeks in order to experience the effectiveness. The physician never went over any of the side effects and basically told me I was crazy and I wasn't experiencing what I was experiencing. I was also having hallucinations. I was sleeping during the day and could not sleep at night. I was freaking out and felt like I wanted to die. My best friend was mortified. That was not the person she knew. I wasn't the person that anyone knew. I have since stopped taking the drug. Reading all of these reviews just reminds me of why I'd never begin taking it ever again. Please check with your physician in reference to the various side effects prior to taking this drug. I think there should be a CLASS ACTION suit against the drug Depakote!!

The worst side effect was the rapid weight gain. I was used to some weight gain from other meds I had used, but on divalproex I gained 40 lbs. in 2 months, then herniated a disc while exercising to take off the weight. Spent two years with back doctors, meanwhile my weight ballooned. I went from 200 (already overweight) to 275. At 275 I developed hight blood pressure, heart disease, rashes, lung problems, and my back pain was excruciating and constant. I stopped taking Divalproex, started a number of heart meds, and my cardiologist supervised a diet, and now I am down to 170. I will always have a bad back now, but it is better than it was. I still have the heart issues, but blood pressure is under control with medication. I am struggling to control my Bi-Polar II without medication, but this was definitely a case of the cure being worse than the disease. I wish I had never been on Divalproex. It nearly killed me, didn't help all that much anyway, and I will suffer the residual health problems the rest of my life.

My doctor gave me this pill without checking any blood work, was not informed of side effects.  Took 1 250 mg pill yesterday and woke up this morning at 7 am, hands/face swollen, tremors, stomach cramps, exhausted, confused, blurry vision, heart racing....if this is for the manic phase, all it did was make it worse, and I had suicidal thoughts....I wouldn't take this pill (and it was to be increased to 3 per day)again.  I do not beleieve Dr's even listen to patients anymore, they seem to think a pill can cure anything.  I have other complications and need surgury, but they put all that off.  I'll just wait until I'm able to go take a walk again and dig in the dirt and plant a garden during a manic episode, but this was HORRIBLE.... life is too short, and I feel this would make my life even shorter.  Cannot even concentrate.

After 1 1/2 years I moved out of state, was rediagnosed Bipolar, and with reservation was switched to Depakote with an antidepressant (Olanzapine).

I've experienced good results after 2 years of treatment with Depakote. The side effects are somewhat troubling (i.e. listlessness and weight gain), however the alternative, a recurrance of an extreme manic episode, vastly 'outweights' (pun intended) these effects. My biggest concern with the medication is that I do feel a significant suppression of my creative side.

ALWAYS take your meds as prescribed!!!"

I was misdiagnosed and mistreated for depression most of my adult life. After 5 days of taking DepakoteER I have noticed a big change. I am a rapid cycling bipolar (minutes not days and hours) I have noticed increased appetite, sex drive and enjoy time with my family that I have not had in 36 years of my life. I am calm, collected and NOT exhausted from my mania. Also, my depression now just a slight sadness that quickly disperses without much effort. I can now laugh and mean it, it isn't just the ""appropriate response"". This includes the smiling and the crying. I am no longer in the ""fog"" of BP but a REAL person with REAL reactions. I would take the side effects and risks to remain this way. I am a person for the first time in my life.
When I began the medication, the first three days were a little rough with the changes my body made (urinating every hour, thirst and frequent bowel movements) but as the drug levels out, my body responds more normally now. I hope this post helps some of you. This drug has helped with my mania AND depression. "

She lives in a retirement community with a level 2 condition of care (not assisted or Altzheimers). She is outgoing , walks slowly with a three wheeler and has a smile most of the time.  
Mos was given Depakote while at a local hospital for treatment of a ""near collapse condition"" with low blood pressure,gastointestinal infection   and heart irregularities.
 She was treated successfully over about 10 days and released back to her senior living residence. 
At the dinner table she quickly became agitated, yelling out her name continually. She was also counting repeatedly and with determination. She was usually calm and peaceful before all of this reaction. 
It turns out that the hospital had been giving her Depakote successfully. The residence nurse and manager did not track with that and the  Depakote  was mistakenly not continued. We, the family, discovered the error by a tip and notified the management who quickly restored the Depakote. Mom's condition improved like a miracle.  She is still on a mild dose and is loving and cheerful again. 
Be cautious of long term dosages.

I tried taking it with food and without food.   With water and then tried taking it with a full glass of milk. Nothing changed and so I eventually, against medical advice, went off of the medication  (all of them).

I could no longer eat certain foods because by the time the fork or spoon got to my mouth my hands were shaking so hard the food had fallen off.  I had problems walking because of the tremors as well.

708$Manic-Depression$7/22/2008 11:02:48 PM$Reviewer: crazyinmaine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have just started taking Depakote a little over a week ago and I wish that I had been taking it sooner it has not kicked in and I had an episode tonight which is the reason I am not in bed at 11pm. I have mania and migraines to boot. I have noticed on some occasions for once I feel relaxed but it hasn't built up enough for my system yet...I am already over-weight and going to do my best to beat the odds and lose weight and keep my hair through taking these meds..Guess I am gonna have to take it 3 times a day soon. I also suffer from insomnia so being able to sleep will be a good thing.

The welbutrin has worked great, but depakote gave me tremors, extreme mood swings and depressive-suicidal thoughts.  even my friends told me to stop using it after they saw my reaction to this drug.  it did not work for me.

207$Rapid Cycle Manic-Depression$6/18/2013 2:10:26 AM$Reviewer: mindymvegan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$4$I have been on this for about 3 months now. My doc started me at 250mg ER (generic) and now at 1000 mg as of 5 days ago. It worked for a little while about half way through the treatment. I had more depressive moods 5 weeks ago til about 3 weeks ago. Then I started getting manic. After the mania for 2 weeks I am rapid cycling throughout the day. Spending too much money, freaking out, not paying attention although on adhd meds for that which she lowered - said it can cause mania. I have lowered my caffeine intake and I still need kava plus theonine to calm me down or 3-4 cups a day of chammomile tea. I really hope this thing works. It also dehydrates me a lot and I feel like I am losing some minerals in my blood since the dose went up.

This medications has truly helped me for 2 years now, not to say I haven't had to deal with some side effects but the trade off to me has been worth it. It is different for each patient and what they feel they need and want.
