I had been having rage and irritability and it had gotten to the point where I was afraid I might hurt my kids or myself.  I called the pdoc and she added the Risperidone and the next day all the rage and irritability was gone, along with the residual depression.   It is a lifesaver.  I'm just worried about weight gain.  I;ve actually lost 2 lbs on it but I;m still worried.  I packed on 60 lbs in 2010 due to psych meds and I still haven;t lost it.

I gave to my baby, 14 months ""clean milk"" Without risperidone. The it was prescribed to me the risperidone oral drops during lactation in a small dose, under the premise that 0,5 mg will not pass to the baby.

Now I have Pituitary Gland Tumor, Pineal Gland tumor, diabetes, hiper insulinism. I had urinary incontinence as fecal one (that stopped). I had hyper menorreah, it was prescribed to me adenomiosis in the utherus, I had to have an hysterectomy. And I have Carpal Tunnel issue. We don't know if it is Dupuytren's or what. We still don't know if the problem of insulin comes from a pancreas damage or what.

All I know is that I had not that before the rsiperidone, and now I have it.

Just in case, after one month taking it, I had a super extraa menstrual bleeding and bothe hands slept with tingling. Since then hands problem had never stopped.

I wish the risks. Of taking the risperidone during lactation had been published. It only said, do not take it during lactation because the risks over the baby have not been established, so, that. Let th e open door for a petit dose, so the risks for the mother are the same of any other women taking it???

When I started taking it I was tired all the time, falling asleep in school, I had been working out 3-4 times a week beforehand and that stopped.  I gained 40 lbs and now have stretch marks all along my waistline.  I went off the medication for 4 months and felt great.  I lost 25 pounds, was in the gym 4 days a week, made the dean's list and felt alive.  Some people from my past did something awful to me and I ended up back in the hospital for 2 weeks.  I was back on the meds and despite doing 3 hours of cardio on an elliptical a week I continued to gain weight slowly.  If I take 2 pills I go to sleep.  This drug is a sedative and destroys your quality of life.

Geodon worked better than seriquil, but after 2 months I could not get more than 2 hours of sleep, and was so tired I cried all night. So my new doctor put me on Risperdal.(uh, hello work the same way) stupid me thought the doctor new best. In the mean time I was having mild sexual side effects that didn't bother me in the least, but I was having muscle weakness too. my doctor tested my testosterone and it was dropping. I then spent the next to years constantly increasing testosterone (which is very had to get and keep getting, but Viagra, that's super easy despite not a single symptom Viagra treats) sexual side effects became a huge problem but no American resource mentions a thing. I asked my doctor, and said problems started on lithium, and got worse with Risperdal and my testosterone was dropping like a rock. My ""doctor"" then told me it wasn't the drugs, increased BOTH, then proceeded to test each and every one of the hormones Risperdal effects. she said prolactin was high but nothing to worry about. The depression from not being able to preform was devastating, and if I had known this was the cause, I would probably not been. * years of Risperdal and lithium later, Risperdal became very unstable very quick. I got a new doctor, and he took me of both and prescribed Limital, and told me What Risperdal does. I spent two months in Hell, coming off these drugs and flooded with emotions. I did not notice how much of a zombie I'd been for 15 years because of medications. AFTER I got off Risperdal, every doctor tells me it is bad news"

It worked wonders. I took it for almost 2 years because I was hungry all the time and gained over 50 lbs on in...from 127 lbs to almost 180...I quit taking it and the weight just started to come off really fast. I lost 40 lbs in just two months but unfortunately, the new medication I am on doesn't work and has caused me to believe things that weren't real, as well as hallucinations that I thought were real like hearing people talking about me around my bed at night, hearing dogs barking, telephone ringing and seeing people....so I had to quit taking it. The medication name was Thorazine.

I use it in conjunction with Valproic Acid mostly for the paranoia I was experiencing back in 2002.  I have been scared to lower dose or go off this but I have also gained 100 pounds and developed type 2 Diabetes.  Stuck between a rock and a hard place right now.

318$Bipolar Depression$7/29/2013 6:16:08 PM$Reviewer: Survivor, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$2$4$I started the treatment of risperdal for my bi-polar about 8 years ago. I first thought, and even now, is that it works well for my symptoms. The thing that happened to me was that I always had a high prolactin level. My periods started to slowly disappear. I would have it one month then not have it for 3. I was only 24 when I started. Then eventually my periods went away for 4 and a half years. I was thrilled that the medication was making me not menstruate since I didnt want anymore children. But after 4 and a half years without a period, abnormal cells began to grow in the uterus. I ended up having endometrial cancer, (uterine cancer) from the mix of hormones that the drug was giving me. After my radical hysterectomy  I went into menopause at 32 years old. Even now, after almost a year after surgery I still am leaking breast milk from the medication. I believe that if you are a woman on this drug, watch your hormones and periods carefully.

I had a twitch in my lip that wouldn't not go away. I told me doctor and she had me stop taking the risperdal and told me to start taking seroquel which I did not. I had UNBELIEVABLE side effects I stopped eating, started smoking again and would not leave my home or drive my car, my personality completely changed to a fun-loving person to some kind of mental case.   I was super paranoid and had unreal panic attacks.  Finally it all ended with a seizure (never had one in my life or history of seizures in my family)that put me on deaths door step. My daugther found me on my kitchen floor she thought I was dead. I fractured my right shoulder from the fall that had to be completely replace and I need additional surgery.  I was hospitalized from 10/29/11 to 12/31/11 and was in a rehab because my right side had also become paralyzed.  I believe with my whole heart and soul that risperdal did this to me.  I am now on 10 different pills including Keppra,seroquel, a multitude of vitamins, high blood pressure meds, pain meds and klonapin.  I was 45 minutes away from death..I have my ex-doctor to thank for this life changing experience and risperdal.  Be careful when taking this medication and never, ever just stop taking it you have to be weened...

They started me on it along with lithium. I have since discontinued lithium but am still on Risperdal. It really helps with irritability so much. I noticed a big difference twice when I ran out of the medication. BUT I also haven't had a period since Jan 09 -prior to starting the medication. I've seen OBGYN'S but they can't figure out why. I'm going to see another this week. But I did hear about and just now read the warning about the hormone problems it causes. It also took away my sex drive I believe. BC as I said I am now off the lithium and my other drugs are for blood pressure and I've been on them for a couple years. But I'm single now anyway so it doesn't matter. But I will discontinue if it is contributing to my lack of periods or I get a boyfriend anytime soon lol.

Seeing no major differece, so we thought, we took him off after starting Kindergarten at age 6.  Mistake.  Within two months he was uncontrollable and worse than before.  He was suspended from Kindergarten for pulling out a peer's hair and deemed ""a threat to himself and others"".  We sought support at Children's Hospital immediately that day and put him back on it, increasing to .5mg/2x daily.  His performance, attention and social skills improved at school.  He has experienced no weight gain but does have a lack of energy.  Recently, due to a new escalation, he is up to .5mg/3x's daily and is in therapy.  He turns seven in a month.  We aren't where we want to be, but Risperdal certainly put us in the right direction.  Although too young to officially diagnose, he is being treated as early onset bipolar.  We also added Trazodone to his regime to help the nightmares and inability to sleep.  I regret fighting the medicinal route for him and encourage parents to hear out your pediatrician or psychiatrist before deciding AGAINST use of this medicine.  I did more harm not listening to the professionals (Pediatrician, Therapist and Psychiatrist).  "

509$Bipolar Depression$8/7/2009 6:43:55 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I was diagnosed with Bi-polar and prescribed this drug. However, after stopping this drug, I have seen many doctors and all of them tell me it was a misdiagnoses because I do not have Bi-polar. However, while on this pill I gained over 100 pounds in less than six months (I was a size zero and now I am lucky to fit into a size 16). I can't say how well it helped my disorder since I did not have any disorder which would be treated by this drug. However, I can say, that it did affect my appetite and I was always hungry I did not eat much more than before, but I always wanted to and even without changing my diet I still more than doubled my weight. Now I have depression because of the side effects of this drug. While weight gain may not happen to everyone, talk to your doctor about other options especially if it is for a child who is under 18 since this drug effects weight in some people this could cause problems in mental and psychical health of children. If you have children who have doctors who are telling them to take it, I strongly recommend not doing so. I was  in high school while on this drug and I was made fun of daily for being fat which is all the worse when it was due to side effects of a drug. (I have been off this drug for three years and only lost 30 pounds so far so the side effects don't end when you are taken of this drug).

BP aTX, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$2$I took Risperdal when I entered treatment for Bipolar 1 (Major Depressive) along with alcohol and meth addiction (snorter).  I was in psychosis from the substance abuse and untreated bipolar. I needed the antipyschotic. It worked well to help me get back to reality. I experienced pretty bad side effects: rapid weight gain, major ticks and uncontrolled body movements, saliva gathering at creases in mouth, body core overheating without notice, extreme lethargy. But! I came back to reality during my seven months on the drug. And sixty five pounds later I was happier fat and sane than skinny and insane. It stabilized my mood, eased the delusions, started the brain chemistry back on track and allowed me to think again.  I had brain fog.  I moved onto Invega a second generation of Risperdal from what I was told with far less side effects.  I'm glad I was not on it very long.  As far as antipsychotics go, one must be aware of the potency and how strong they can be as far as side effects. Please take precautions ie avoid heating up as I did not realize how I could suddenly heat my core and hit the ground.  But  you can take other drugs for the ticks and it really worked on the psychosis for me. I toughened up on this drug. It made many I went onto the past six years seem tame... Relativity... and sanity. It did work. It hurt and I got fat but I got better.

When I started taking Risperdal I was 130 lbs., now I'm 220; and if anything my eating has gotten better. It makes me hungry. I have been taking birth control for 5 years, and nothing's ever been different.. but now that I've been on Risperdal for 2ish years, it has significantly slowed down. I take Effexor XR for depression/panic attacks, Lithium/mood stabilizer, and Risperdal for anger and manic episodes. I have tried Geodon, Abilify, Saphris, & many others. None of them have been as effective as Risperdal, but the side effects of it are killer. I am going to try Latuda and Saphris again because I didn't truly give Saphris a chance. Good luck

It helped with the anger issues I have been dealing with. I have always had a weight problem and gained about thirty pounds. Since then I have been working out about 10 hours a week and keeping my calories restricted. I can't seem to get this weight off. I started getting very tired but kept on taking it because it was working. It got to the point that all I wanted to do was sleep. Also, it ruined my sex life. I have just cut my dose from 2mg to 1mg but it too soon to tell if this will help.

274$Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$3/20/2015 2:59:19 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication is the one that worked best for me. I have had bipolar episodes for years. Just recently, I began experiencing somatic symptoms and severe panic attacks. The Risperdal helped me control the unwanted thoughts that I had a terminal illness, helped ease the somatic symptoms I am experiencing (somatic meaning unwanted feelings such as tingiling in head, twitching, head rushes, and so forth). Everything I have is contributed to mania. The Risperdal helped ease all of these horrible symptoms almost immediately and is starting to help me get my life back and improve my overall quality of life. I was so scared by these unwanted health concerns and feelings that I almost went mad and had no pleasure or enjoyment in anything. I would just worry something was horrifically wrong with me. I do still get the night attacks right before falling asleep but it is getting much better. I have experienced some minor side effects: muscle stiffness, increased reflexes, which may still contribute to my somatic disorder but they can be side effects (minor) from Risperdal. Do expect to gain some weight and be extremely tired but the tiredness does pass once you let the Risperdal work its way into your system and do its job. Please do read all of the side effects as all medications work differently on different people. If you have dementia or have QT syndrome or any other heart problem DO NOT take this medication. All I can advise is just tell your doctor your history of medical problems, like all medications, be careful. For myself, Risperdal has saved my mental well being and has drastically improved my quality of life and happiness.

I have been taking it for 2 months and it is already causing unwanted side effects. I have decided to continue taking it for now though because it DOES help my mania/depression and mixed episodes. Sometimes the side effects are better than the bipolar symptoms, which are severe and debilitating for me. Overall I say it works but be prepared to notice some other changes as well. If these side effects worsen for me I will discontinue taking it.

I'm 5""4 and weigh approximately 128 lbs.  This drug helps me to manage my sometimes uncontrollable emotions extremely well.  I have recently had some manic episodes, though.  I am going through a very difficult time in my life right now (separating from my husband of 18 years), and I would not dare stop taking my meds!  My doctor also prescribed Ativan for anxiety attacks-but I rarely need to take one.  Risperdal, for me, has been a God-send.

Risperdal is the only one that worked to relieve my bipolar mania symptoms, namely hearing voices, being paranoid and having anxiety all the time. The only downside is I gained over 60 pounds. I was already obese to begin with so gaining so much weigh has just put a huge burden on me. Also I have trouble losing weight but I'm not sure that it's the Risperdal that is causing it. Oh, I finally ended up on 6mg. That's a relatively high dose for someone with bipolar but I do have a severe form of it.

He started this medicine and within 2 days he was amazingly better.  He is almost 7 and is on .5 mg twice per day.  If we skip a dose, it's obvious, as he's angry and irritable again.  When he's on it without missing a dose he is happy, loving, appropriately energetic, sleeps through the night.  He still has a full range of emotions and is very caring and loving and social.  It has made a tremendous difference to our family as things had gotten very bad and he had even talked about leaving the family and suicide a couple of times.  He was on a higher dose (just .5 mg more) and he started having trouble swallowing, so I took him off it for a week while we decided what to do.  All his psychological symptoms cam back within 2 days... His psychiatrist wants him to stay on it but I'm vigilant for any swallowing issues and I will give him Benedryl at the first sign of anything.  He has oral dyspraxia also so he already had difficultly with swallowing and breath control/cooridination, so it's hard to say if it's the Risperdal or not.  He has gained weight, 8 pounds so far, but we are trying to develop better eating habits!

Doctor at first thought meningitis and was ready to order a  Spinal tap until he looked up side effects of this drug. the side effects he experienced maybe rare but not worth the pain he experienced. after an injection of benadryl he became well and was released. suffice to say, he will no longer be taking this medication. he just started this treatment Friday as a mood stabalizer in conjunction with ADHD his ADHD med is DEXTROAMPHETAMINE (10mg once a day). ER doctor says its a 1 and 1000 chance side effect, unfortunately our lottery winning odds arent as good.

While it has helped with his aggression (this is a boy who at age 2 stabbed his father with a knife and at age 3 attempted to suffocate his newborn brother with a pillow) we are still not seeing a complete turn around in him. I am a parent adversive to medicating my children but felt in this instance it was the best course of action. The small dosage is why he maintains an aggressive talk therapy regime from many angles (not only a psychologist and psychiatrist but also with school counselors, church pastors, etc). So far we have seen a weight gain but cannot rule out this was not genetically based as I did the same at his age. No other side effects have been present. He has been on the meds for almost 6 months.

She had severe mood swings, suicidal thoughts, and was becoming violent in school. She recently switched to this medication 8 months ago and it has worked OK. Overall, she bahavior is stable, sleeping well, and bedwetting has not returned. No weight gain to report. The downside is at times she seems ""out of it"" just staring into space. Her ability to focus is also reduced. Now that puberty has set in and after a recent growth spurt we are showing experiencing symptoms again. One downside is that the doctors do not (or are not willing) to increase the dosage as a child grows because the pills are only offered in certain increments. Until she grows more, quite a bit more, we will have to deal with the issues until the medication can be increased. "

I began rapid cycling with extreme fluctuations and of course the problems that go with the deep depression and mania states I was in.  I was hospitalized in March 2010 and placed on resperdal 2mg at bedtime.  I am careful about my weight as I take other medications that cause fluctuations.  Until today (12/5/10) I was unaware this medication caused weight gain.  In the last 4 months I've gained over 20 lbs even though I've been trying to control my weight.  I'm heavier than I've ever been and I also suffer from Fibromyalgia and am small framed.  My body can't take the extra weight as its too hard on my joints.  I am now considering having my meds changed.  I've been through that too alot thru the years and don't like to mess with a good regimen but I really am having a hard time with my added weight and wonder if the risperdal has contributed.

I was on 2mg twice a day. Moved it to 1 and I was still experiencing bad symptoms; such as being very hungry, and very lazy. Iâ??d take it and get so relaxed I wouldnâ??t get up from my bed. Since I am off of it now, Iâ??ve gained all my motivation back, working out , walking, and able to control my eating . If anyone is experiencing these problems or trying to find out about this medicine , I recommend you to not take it . Unless you like being over weight. I am still taking something else for anxiety btw . Everything else is fine BUT this medication. Donâ??t take it .

The joint and muscle pain is targeted mainly to both hands and arms. My hands are also stiff.

I have been to jail, and my insurance no longer places me in decent facilities because of this route of treatment. You are viewed negatively.

309$Manic-Depression$10/14/2013 6:41:43 AM$Reviewer: Cappi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$I have now been on Risperidone 1 MG tablet once a day for 3 days short of a month and it has evened out my moods for the most part.  The only problem that I seem to be having is that my emotions are so much stronger than they have been in many years.  I do not know if this is a side effect or if it is due to the fact that I have hardly felt any emotions at all in so many years.  I actually have strong feelings of sadness and happiness (and I even smile or laugh on occasion now)but I am also having a lot of anger issues since about a week after starting the medication.  At first I thought that the anger I was feeling was situational but as I continue to take it the anger is getting out of control to the point that if something falls off of my computer stand or I have difficulties doing an easy task, I will actually cuss out loud which is something I have not done in many years.  I did, however, go from eating next to nothing to having a healthy appetite and maybe at times eating a bit too much.  My anger issues are the biggest problem I am having since being on this medication and I have tried many coping strategies in order to deal with it.  I was hoping that by posting my experience on WebMD that I could possibly find out if any other people have had anger issues while taking Risperidone.  I would greatly appreciate any and all suggestions to make this issue go away.  If you do have any ideas that could possibly help then please e-mail me at [email protected] as I hardly ever go on the WebMD site.

I will not keep taking this medication. If I do keep taking it, I would just live to sleep my days away. My mind was so confused too. It felt as if I had died in bed, now that I'm off of it, It feels like I started a new life. This medicine is very scary to take. It's not worth it to me. I would rather not sleep than to sleep my life away.

403$Manic-Depression$1/19/2011 9:36:29 PM$Reviewer: manicmarty, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$First of all, I must say that I'm hyper-manic most of the time. I started this around Thanksgiving and at 1st it worked well towards my aggressive feelings towards my hard to get a long with mother in law, but needed to have the 4 mg. dose lowered due to feeling just BLAAAAA. No feelings whatsoever towards her or doing anything. Then that feeling soon changed and we upped the dose back to the original prescription again because the blaas went away and I didn't want to feel aggressive again as I'm not normally an aggressive person whatsoever, not ever. Then I started feeling anxious all the time from it,like on speed. As soon as I was taken off of it the other day and put on Seroquel, I could feel an almost instant change and a lot more mellow now. I HATE IT. It also gave me the 'munchies' all the time, which is bad because I had bariatric surgery back in 2006. I've been blessed so far in that Seroquel, so far, hasn't done this yet.

My intense mood swings ranging from severe depression to full blown panic attacks made me want to kill myself everyday of my life, and I even tried suicide several times.

I am 27 years old. I've been a manic-depressive my whole life. Last year, I was hospitalized for a week due to my condition. When I was there, they perscribed Risperdal to me (along with other meds). 

After taking this med for 2 weeks, my body felt bad physically. My muscles felt stiff, I had dizzyness upon standing, & I got really drowsy. As soon as I saw my doctor, I was taken off of this med, immediately.

I would rather be on no meds & have unpredictable mood swings, than have to be stuck on this stuff."

One milligram and then two milligram. I took it to help me sleep. I believe it is dangerous because my triglicerides were so high I think I had a stoke I think It is more common for older people under a different term. I would not prescribe this drug. I believe it has caused damage to me. If I were I would only give 1/2 gram to someone. This is a very dangerous drug. It causes weight gain very quickly. I haven't taken it in years. Too bad you have to be dead to sue the FDA. I weened off it over two years or more. Since I dropped my weight and new the risks. It just should be monitored closely or else.

I wouldnt recommend this medication if your trying to get pregnant because when i was trying to get pregnant i could not which is really disapointing when your doctor tells your capable of concieving and its not happening. My OBGYN told me that this medication could affect your ability to concieve. now that i switched medications im currently 8 weeks pregnant. The medication is great for children, but I personally dont think adult women should take it. there are alot of other medicines that treat the same thing without so many side effects

It also caused me to become restless and agitated, making it necessary to constantly pace for hours without stopping, except for meals.

Recommendation: If taking the medication and you start to have an allergic reaction, immediately report it to your doctor. Also, log the information, the allergic reaction, date and time of the occurrence(s). This way, when you have an appointment, you doctor can see how often this reaction is occurring."

It controls the thought process that leads to psychosis. It is necessary to know that strong emotions tend to develope into my rapid cycling and extremes with anxiety. A calming effect is necessary to deal with everyday stress. Risperdal taken with cogentin is the medication mix that works with me. Since I cannot handle any kind of stimulant in medications nor anything that severly sedates me it helps me with both spectrumes.
