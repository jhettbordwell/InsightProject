64$Bipolar Depression$7/29/2012 11:02:31 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$2$4$I have only been on this medicine for a few days.  I take 10 mg at night, and in the morning I feel hung over until about 2 to 4 pm, then I feel normal for about 4 to 5 hours before I take it again. I do not feel depressed, anxiety, or moody.  I do feel like someone is scrambling my brains. I have been on other bi-polar medicine for 15 years, and about every 5 to 6 years I need to switch because medicine either does not help, or I have become manic. So far I am not happy with this medicine, but will continue to try it for a few weeks to give it a fair try.

Happy one minute, next minute a total horses butt, next minute ready to kill myself, and then break down and cry like a baby. NEVER again! Thanks to my wife that she handled me for one month like this.

I had to get up to walk them off and then got bad muscle spasms in my back. Begged the doctor to take me off.

185$Bipolar Depression$6/20/2009 2:47:14 AM$Reviewer: [emailÂ protected], 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$So far I have had good results with taking this medication. My moods seem to be a little better I think lol I would like to ask everyone that is doing reviews or reading this.....Has weight gain been a problem for you on this medication? I quit smoking about 3 months ago (about the time I started taking this medication) so I am not sure which is causing the weight problems I am having. I hate to give up on this and go to a different drug because of the weight issue but on the flip side I know being overweight is just about as unhealthy as being depressed all the time. Please if anyone has any cooments or suggestions e~mail me. I would love to hear other peoples thoughts on the weight issue. Thank you in advance!

241$Bipolar Depression$9/9/2008 4:52:30 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I was started on Paroxetine recently after being treated on Citilapram which was not effective.  I have found that Paroxetine  has really improved my mood. There are side effects though which is a down side. It is the only antidepressant that has worked since taking Venlafaxine.  I had to come off that last year due to severe side effects.  
258$Bipolar Depression$4/20/2008 10:46:28 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$ive been taking this medication for 2yrs. it helps alot. i started at 50 but now down to 40. i would actualy like to stop taking it but it does have side affects when you stop. so this is just a warning. never just stp taking it always get your doctor to help. you will get dizzy, hot flashes, not even able to really walk. just always have your doctor help you cut down.
266$Bipolar Depression$3/18/2008 12:43:17 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I have been on this drug for about a week and I'm unfortunately reacting badly to it.  I'm feeling more depressed than I was before I started it at times.  Though I do have times where I feel great.  That means I'm in that small percentage of the people who take it that have a bad reaction to it.  That doesn't mean that you will though so don't be scared to take it.  This was just my experience with it.
