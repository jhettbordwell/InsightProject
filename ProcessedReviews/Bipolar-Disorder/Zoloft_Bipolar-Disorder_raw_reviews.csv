62$Bipolar Depression$9/26/2014 10:26:44 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I have been on this medication for over a year and it has made a big difference in my moods. About a month ago I stopped taking it on my own because I was feeling so satisfied with myself and life that I thought I didn't need to take it. I was wrong. After about 5 days I was back to crying over nothing, causing pointless arguments with my boyfriend and completely feeling worthless and like my life was pointless. It was the worse decision I have made in quite some time. I am not back on it and feeling good again. I see the difference it has made in my life. I can focus on the good, deal with the bad, and still be myself. 

I have only one trouble and that is that I take it in the morning, but I can't sleep at night. "

During the first 2-4 weeks I did experience some dizziness, light-headedness, nauceousness, etc...but that only lasted that short period of time while my body became used to it.  Now, it makes me less irritable and I just seem to have a more positive mood, more often.  No drug is 100% effective, but this one is pretty close!  I went off of it for about a month around Christmas time because I became very busy and kept putting off getting my refill, and boy could I tell a HUGE difference!  My anxiety came back full force, my extreme irritabilty returned, and my mood swings were quite often.  Once I got my refill and started back up, it was good again!  I hate that I feel like I'll never be able to be without medication to be ""normal"", but I am very thankful that I found something that works so well for me! "

I had some side effects initially but nothing major, made my face break out a little bit, delayed orgasm, and increase in appetite.  I am not sure if anyone else was having the same problems, but overall it is really helping me take control of my life again and show interest in things I love to do.  Both my friends and family have noticed a change in the short amount of time I have been taking it.  I am glad I am on this medication.

Is there anyone else that has been having some or similar side effects?"

Missing even one dose pushes me inside the gates of Hell within 24 hours; First I get very irritable, then develope a very quiet rage where I hate everything & everyone,including my husband, the dog, the toaster, water, air, and most of all myself. I feel like I'm living inside a monster without Sertraline and I fall into extremely deep depression with uncontrollable tears. Suicide would be a certainty without Sertraline. I still need help with generalized dysphoria, but I can live with that. My hair's thinning badly but that's a small price for sanity!

Finally my doctor switched me to sertraline 50mg about four months ago and I feel amazing.  This rx has been a lifesaver for me!  I have gained a few pounds, but don't believe it's from the medication.  I really believe that I am much more happier and relaxed and have been more social, going out and what not.  I believe that's where the weight came from.  The only thing is that if I miss a dose, I can immediately tell within 12-24 hours, and my anxiety begins coming back.  I highly highly recommend this medication for someone with depression/manic phases/anxiety.  Excellent med.

I just went through some tough times (money, loss of friend) and went back to my dr. and asked for it again. I take 50 mg at night and will be increasing it soon to 100 mg. I feel better, no mood swings (crying then angry). I feel better when I am on it then when I am not and my family likes me better too! Overall this has worked great for me.

488$Bipolar Depression$10/25/2007 12:59:11 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug was only effective for me when I first took and stayed on a mood stabilizer to address my mania. I went through the agonizing process of being treated solely with anti-depressants twice by my family doctor. Unfortunately, he only saw the depression but missed the harder to detect manic side. SSRIs alone made me feel worse at it amplified my mania. Topamax and Sertraline have worked wonders for me. The third critical piece is working with a therapist that truly understand bi-polar.

690$Bipolar Depression$7/10/2014 1:19:46 PM$Reviewer: Successful worker, wife, and mom to 3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken a combination of Zoloft and depakote for 10 years for bipolar NOS.  The combination has been extremely effective with no side effects other than moderate weight gain.  I have gained 30 pounds over 10 years.  However, I would rather be 30 pounds heavier and not feel intense anxiety, cry frequently, feel unable to handle life, be paralyzed, feel depressed-suicidal, have irrational thoughts, etc.  he Zoloft turns the irrational thoughts off like a light switch!  I also did cognitive behavior therapy the first two years of my diagnosis which helped.  I will occasionally take a low dose of Xanax once every 3-4 months for extremely stressful- anxious situations. I have been happy, enjoy life, am confident, sleep great, and feel like I can successfully handle life.  I exercise for 45 minutes 5-7 days a week, eat fairly healthy, and keep my sleep/wake cycle the same.  I tried 3 different drugs before finding a combination that worked. Sometimes side effects last a couple weeks, or it takes a month to titrate up to a full dosage.  I recommend sticking it out for 6 weeks to give any medication a chance unless you are completely miserable or develop an allergic reaction.

This was living normal EXCEP T it caused diahrrea.  It seems eating triggered evacuation.   I could not eat out, nor if traveling. I didn't know what it was so first, I eliminated foods...then beverages.  Nothing helped even with meds could not control it.  No pain or cramping. Finally stopped Zoloft and within 5 days was managing diahrrea.  It's been 6 weeks and it seems to be improving very slowly w/o mds..  Though I'm driving everyone nuts while trying to control emotions. My greatgrandkids say it's OK, Grams is going thru her teens again.  I can't sit still.   HOPE this helps someone.
819$Bipolar Depression$8/21/2013 1:40:52 AM$Reviewer: Happy Man, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I originally began with Celexa 10mg right when I graduated high school [when I decided to treat my severe depression].  At first, the Celexa worked for the first month, but then the benefits wore off relatively quickly.  Overall, the Celexa had generally low side-effect profile, it just made me lethargic at times.  After the Celexa, I was put on Lexapro [which is in fact the stereoisomer to Celexa]; however, I thought the Lexapro was absolutely ineffective.  Finally, I've been taking Zoloft for the past few months now and it is a miracle.  I haven't had an anxiety attack since I started it, my depression seems to have significantly faded, and I can do things normally again.  Again, this drug is fantastic, I have finally found personal contentment.  In brief, I had a mix of general bipolar, mild OCD, and moderate anxiety disorder.  In fact, I tried the Ativan as an icebreaker, but the Zoloft was actually more effective.  This drug--has worked my life wonders.

This medications seems to be helping coupled with another.  The side effects that I have are insomnia, VERY crazy dreams, VERY vivid dreams, sex drive is nonexistant and coming to an orgasm is tricky.  For the insomnia I purchased melatonin and I take it when I NEED sleep because I can't function.  Usually one a week.  The dreams can be good or bad but the fact that I can remember them can be horrible when they're bad dreams because it feels like I'm awake.  My sex drive tanked but I have a great significant other and he makes sure that the mood is set and when I have trouble having an orgasm we just take our time, go slow and talk to each other.  Since I've been taking the medication I've only had an issue with an orgasm 3 or 4 times.

1154$Bipolar Depression$9/19/2011 5:55:23 PM$Reviewer: kayosphere, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"In 2008, I was put through the ringer on multiple medications as my doctor and I searched and searched for appropriate treatments for my mood disorder. While my other medications quarantined the majority of my symptoms, including the most severe spikes in my moods and the worst outbursts of my impulsiveness, I was lingering in a generally unhappy and psychologically unstable depressive zone, and I was completely miserable. Five months ago, Zoloft was added to control the last bits of anxiety I was having at work. It completely removed paranoia, fear, anxiety, depression, and everything that comes along with those symptoms, and it made me feel more ""normal"" and confident than I have ever felt since I can remember in my 28 years. Within the last six months, I have been through a divorce, a bankruptcy, and I have lost my father to alcoholic liver disease. It was just two months after my divorce when my psychiatrist added Zoloft to my other medications. I have not taken an anti-anxiety pill since I've been on Zoloft, and I have never felt better. The mood swings I experienced after taking any sort of anti-anxiety drugs were far too severe, so it was simply better for me to avoid them and deal with the stability of the anxiety rather than the anxiety and the anger that accompanied it when I was ""coming down"" off of the drug. With the help of Zoloft, I have improved myself three-fold; I'm making leaps and bounds socially, professionally, personally, and financially, and it is completely amazing what a difference I see in myself because I have been able to accept the help others have offered me. I see the strength within myself to keep on going rather than curl into a ball and lock myself away into a deep dark hole. Everything is tolerable; life is much brighter. There are still sucky days, but I never have trouble being optimistic. I've seen hell, and I know I can conquer it."

It was a get up and go with any bad sick feelings. Once I got pregnant with my child I discontinued to take the medication unlike other people whom decide to mess up their children by taking the medication just for purposes to sue. My child is seven years old and she had surgery on her neck for a swollen lymp node but that was due to her dad passing that problem to me when concieved it was benign. My beautiful daughter is Isabella Janice Mitchell and she is doing fine from that but I do know how to quit a medication when I concieve.

I have a mild case of OCD, severe depression, anxiety, and bipolar II. Zoloft has helped with all of the above except OCD. I take it by itself now, but I used to take it with depakote.

I've tried about 5 diff kinds of meds.  Zoloft keeps me from turning into a monster.  W/out Zoloft, I am bitter, mouthy, verbally abusive, spiteful, emotional, mad, sad, angry, irritable, etc. to those around me.  Yes, Zoloft may put a damper on your sex drive, as it did for me for years, but now it doesn't seem to be a problem.  I still have bouts of depression, and sometimes I'm just wiped out.  After seeking help of at least 6 doctors, I was diagnosed with having a Bi-Polar D/O, Panic Attacks, Anxiety and Agoraphobia D/O.  I know I will be on Zoloft (and Depakote) for many years to come and I am totally fine w/that.  Regardless of the many people saying ""it's all in my head"" ""use something natural"" ""etc"". . . they are entitled to their opinion.  But as far as I am concerned, I know my body better than anyone - and - Zoloft is my life saver.  Without it, I would be in bed loosing days, weeks, months, years.  I would miss out on my children growing up.  I would miss out on LIFE, the one that my parents brought into this world.  So many people are on meds.  Don't ever be ashamed of being on meds, it is who we are.  Thank goodness for research and pharmaceutical companys.  You continue to help us survive everyday life."

No birth defects in my daughter! She is almost 2yrs old now and very happy nad healthy! I am as well! Taking this medication in conjuction with Lamictal has helped immensely to curb my drastic changes in mood.  I can effectively communicate my feelings and do so without becoming overwhelmed or hostile. I have noticed that taking a dosage as high as I do has serious side effects when combined with copius amounts of alcohol! It recently caused me to have a psychotic episode, landing me in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt.  I have since been sober and am letting the medication work to it's full potential. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and severe anxiety disorder which is managed with adderal and alprazolam. This mixture of medication is ideal for my conditions, only thing I've noticed is the decrease in sex drive, which I don't consider a bad thing, as I believe it was one of my addictions in the past. I'd much rather be healthy and happy than fall back into my old self-destructive ways! I do contribute my wellness to the medication and supportive people in my life. I have a reason to be here and I can clearly see that now! ;-)

At first, this drug seemed like a miracle. I was happy, out-going and social (which is very unusal for me), I had energy, I felt great, slept well and started to gain some self-confidence. I became much more active and accomplished much more than usual. I thought I was doing great after about 2 years, thought I no longer needed it and quit cold turkey, which you SHOULD NOT do! I felt like I was rolling backwards down a never-ending hill for about 2 weeks, and had to stay still in bed with my eyes closed. I had terrible headaches and trembling.  I got back on it a few years later, after my depression became severe and I started crying uncontrollably and cutting myself frequently. I felt better after about a week, however my extreme irritability, anxiety, high-stress and feelings of being overwhelmed remained.  THIS DRUG COMPLETELY KILLS YOUR SEX DRIVE! I feel disgusted at the thought of sex and don't want to be touched. If my husband groped me, I cringed in disgust. Which is not like me at all. I am going to be switching to Prozac soon. I guess it lost its effectiveness over time?  Zoloft also worked great for mom for about 6 months, then it stopped working for her too. You can only go up to 200mgs, so you can only increase your dosage so much. Overall, I'm not very pleased with Zoloft, and would not recommend it, especially if you ever want to have sex and experience any level of intimacy again.

2012$Bipolar Depression$7/30/2009 9:54:28 PM$Reviewer: Mateo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$3$"Having dealt with Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and OCD for the last 10 years -- Zoloft has helped me immensely.  In my experience it starts to alleviate symptoms w/in 1-2 weeks, but finding the correct dosage is critical; too high of a dose tended to promote mania for me.

First, I tried Paxil for 1 1/2 years but my experience with it at 10-40mg was that Paxil, although effective, made me feel “mentally numb.""
 
A switch to Zoloft proved to better treat my symptoms without the “numbness.” But I was still symptomatic for 2 years while taking only 100mg.  After an increase to 150mg I felt much better, but had to watch out for manic episodes.  

Side effects: these are well documented.  Starting, stopping, increasing/decreasing brings on: ""electric shock"" sensations in arms and legs, waking up frequently at night, clenching one's jaw while sleeping, and disturbing lucid dreams.  At times I felt I was losing my mind, especially when I abruptly stopped taking the medication.  It has been my experience that these side effects abate w/in 2 weeks.

Also to note: for anxiety and mania, caffeine is the devil!!  Switching to decaf was essential to my progress.  Even just one cup o' joe would launch me into major anxiety and/or mania for days.  I can't stress enough how critical this was for me.

Sexual side effects: yeah, they’re a problem.  My gf told me I “needed to have a long talk with Mr. Wiener.”  We broke up.  It helps to have a girlfriend who is supportive, not selfish, about your progress.

In conclusion, including Zoloft as a part of my therapy has opened doors for me that have been shut for years.  After a stressful six-year military career, and having up and quit seven jobs since, failing in semester after semester of college, surviving a school shooting, and a tragic end to a 2-year relationship, I was suicidal every day.  Taking Zoloft helped me overcome my symptoms for Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and OCD, and helped me get back living again.

I had gained quite a bit of weight on the Lexapro (which made me feel even worse), I have already lost 1/4 of the weight that I had gained & the Zoloft doesn't make me feel like I'm a ""space cadet"" I had lots of episodes where I would completely zone out on the Lexapro, now that is gone... I am so happy to have the Zoloft, I think we are going to have to up my dose, but I feel 10 times better than I did with the Lexapro."

2245$Bipolar Depression$3/20/2009 9:11:01 AM$Reviewer: ungodly69, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$People with true Bipolar disorder need to use extreme caution when taking a SSRI without mood stabilizers. I was on Zoloft for exactly 4 weeks and at the beginning of the third week, the severe sexual side effects (total loss of interest and decreased ability) were unbearable. This had induced a severe hypomania episode that lasted for days. I had to see my Dr. and have the medication discontinued to stop the mania. This medication also seemed to severely increase my anxiety. My thoughts raced uncontrollably, and they were not good thoughts. This medication works well for DEPRESSION, but will put your mood at the other end of the spectrum (mania) if you're not taking a mood stabilizer at the same time.

I hate the side effects, though.  For me, I often have no appetite, I have a very decreased sexual desire, and sometimes I feel very NEUTRAL about things.  (I know that the medication is meant to level my moods, but it often makes me feel ""stuck"" in the middle, and I find it difficult to motivate myself to do things.  I recognize that is a side effect for me, so I have to make an effort to ""jump start"" myself out of the ""funk"" that I feel.
The side effects are unpleasant, but NOT taking my medication is WORSE.  If I don't take my Zoloft as prescribed, after about 2 days, I really start to feel funny.  (I get what I call the ""blinkies"", I hear swishing when I blink or turn my head quickly.  It is kind of like the sound you hear when you have water in your ears.  It is bothersome.  After a few more days, I begin to notice a severe change in my mood.  I fly off the handle or cry or get emotional over the most minor things.  I have tried just about every antidepressant there is, and even with the side effects, I have the best results with Zoloft."

It doesn't take long for it to do it's job. It doesn't make me feel foggy or drugged. However, it did eliminate what sex drive I had. I had a conversation with my doctor addressing this and he prescribed periactin. The periactin was successful in restoring my sex drive. Honestly, that is the only complaint I have of Zoloft. The next time I fall into depression, it will be my drug of choice.

He was manic for several days.  Too much talking, inappropriate language, acted like a wind up doll turned up too high.  At the hospital, he got angry and hit a wall, fracturing his own hand.  They added Seroquel which helped but he was still doing weird things like scratching up his arms because he was bored and jumping down the stairs at school which resulted in a sprained ankle.  It made him happy and not depressed, but caused other disturbing problems.
