I feel slight weight gain with Invaga 3mg and am experiencing suffocation feelings as I sleep.  Not sure I'll continue this medication much longer.

I'd stopped taking the pill before and lost 40 pounds before, so I know it is the Invega. I look forward to trying something else. Bad knees/back I can hardly walk...but great for the mood besides that!

52$Bipolar Depression$5/22/2012 12:41:46 AM$Reviewer: flower, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$3$Invaga worked for me the first two months  Then just recently I gained weight in my abdomen area real fast and am suffering other side effets. They are extreme fatigue, feeling anxious,very worried,depressed, numbness in hands and feet, sore muscles, blurry vision and frequent urination. I am not sure why this has occured. I am going through a really hard time also. My father is not feeling good at times and I get so upset cause he is very important to me. Also my hus band says he will be leaving me to go home to his country which will leave me in charge of finances and a new place to live. They say stress can cause depression. I am seeking the help of my psychologist and my aunts,Dad,cousins,Uncle and my sister.  I think also my sleep schedule is off. I don't go to bed until real late and sleep in alot. The weight gain from the invega worries me the most its about 40 pounds. My doctor told me Invega is not a weight gaining drug and that is not true bcause I WAS VERY THIN IN THE BEGINNING. My husband puts me down cause of my weight and that makes me depressed. I really was doing better when I was fourty pounds less. I had more energy then. But that was also before I got the news of my Dads serious condition and my husband saying hes leaving in the future. Im going to review the effectiveness of Invega and side effects with my Pschiatrist as soon as possible. I have appointment on June  6.
56$Bipolar Depression$1/30/2012 8:38:31 AM$Reviewer: doinmybest, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication is a life saver for me. It controls my deep, dark depressions, paranoia, and delusions. I was initially taking Risperdal, which caused me to develop tremors.  Invega provides me with the same results as Risperdal without the side effect of tremors. I was initially taking 6 mg a day but started to suffer from mood swings and paranoia. I am currently on 9 mg and am doing fantastic. I am very pleased with the effects of this medication and would recommend it to anyone suffering from bipolar disorder. I initially gained 20 lb while taking it but I am now carefully watching what I eat and exercising and the weight is slowly coming off.

63$Bipolar Depression$4/14/2011 10:43:21 AM$Reviewer: nightrockerplus, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$4$I have been on Invega 9mg for about 3 years now. I am 49 and have had bad bi-polar since I was 7.  I have literally tried all the drugs out there.  This is the only one, besides Depakote (1750mg daily,) and Klonopin (6mg, daily) to slow my manic episodes down.  I don't like the weight gain, as I have gained 25 lbs. even with heavy exercise.. When I have low points I add in 100 mg of Pristiq and I am fine for about 6 months.  It's a balancing act that I fall off way too often.

I went to my gynocologist because I was lactating and he immed. ordered a brain MRI. I now have a pituitary tumor (prolactinoma). I had prolactin lvls. of 89.6 while on Invega, dropping to 5.2 after only 2 weeks off it. No one told me that this could happen, even info on the net didn't mention this. I also am on Metformin now because of the high blood sugar s/e, now permanent. I had Tardive Dyskenesia in hands; it went away. I have permanent sun sensitivity. Obviously, for me, the benefits didn't outweigh the risks. I have changed doctors, part of the problem, and now take Lamictal. I have had no s/e and it is working good. I guess I'm one of the people that Invega DIDN""T work for!"

She put me on welbutrin, but I was still terribly sick. I was really ready to give up, and go to a hospital. Then she started me on Invega 3 mg every night and I have NEVER felt this good, and I am 57, have had bp all of my life. I quit smoking several months ago, and have had two months of acute bursitis in both hips, so no exercise. So I have gained about 5 lbs, and think it's the combo of those three things. At this point, with the way I feel now, I can tolerate a little chubbiness!

I can concentrate, I think clearly, I can write (I'm a college student so have many papers to write), I have my interests back.  I love this medication.  It as changed my life so much.  I actually enjoy doing things now...being with the family...interacting with everyone!!  Thank you so much for finding this medication.  In all the years I have had to deal with my Bi-Polar I have never felt more like myself then I do now (just without all the bad stuff!).  Oh, and a nice side effect is that I have lost 17 pounds which I put much more then that on when I was on the Risperdall.  This is a wonderful medication in so many ways!!

I've gone through about 7 doctors and even more medications.  The dosage that has finally been successful the past 2 years has been lithium, lamictal, and invega.  I used to take geodon, but my personal feelings of distress (more physical than anything else) made me beg for something else.  And then, whala!  A new drug called invega.  I soon was able to study for school better, my relationship with my then girlfriend now wife went to new heights; I even have been able to sustain a job for the past two years, all while buying my first home at 25 and a new car.  I truly attribute invega for giving me the stability to be myself again.

Whether or not this is due to
the Cogentin, I don't know.  While taking Invega with 100 mg of Seroquel, I experienced anxiety and my mental outlook was poor.  I always looked at the negative side of things and fixated on the worst possible scenario.  It's unclear as to whether or not my psychiatrist will keep me on Invega.  "

I noticed a twitching in my toes and fingers. This minor twitching has continued for the 6 months I have been on it.  I could not sleep when I first started taking it, but was hospitalized for 5 days because I couldn't sleep. I had a tough time trying to get to sleep and when I finally did sleep I sweated greatly!  The sleep problems went away and my behavior was fine for about 5 1/2 months. Now the sleep problems are startng again.  It seems I have slight problems breating and the tingling /twithching in my toes and feet are more severe.  I get real thirsty and drink lots of water.  It as if the systems in my body are shutting down and adrenalin is being pumped into my blood to keep my systems going which in turn keeps me awake.  The drug seems to calm me down but only for a short period of time after taking it. They just uped me from 6 mg to 9mg two days ago.  We will see how it goes.

I'm not paranoid and my thoughts are not racing at all. I was on abilify, and I went out of the range of abilify and fell into a manic phase for several months. To say the least it was horrible. My current doctor put me on invega and I like the fact that I seem to be more sound and not manic or paranoid. However, now I am very sluggish and lazy. I feel depressed and I have gained a lot of weight.  My body just seems to me weighed down all the time. I also easily get indigestion now. I am also lacking focus and have a terrible time doing basic tasks like getting dressed of doing the laundry. I take it in the morning along with an anti-anxiety medication. I'm going to talk to my doctor about all of the side effects that I am experiencing to see if there is another medicine out there for me. It would be great if I could find a drug that gave me the balance and clarity of invega and the pep that I got from abilify. I had no weight gain when I was on abilify.

Scared to start it because of it being a new drug. Taking the Cymbalta and attivan and I am scared of the depakote because friends have told me it can eventually make you have seizures? After the reviews I am going to start it tonight and see how it goes, not sure about the depakote though? The medicine is oddly enough covered by my medicaid. I pay $3 dollars a script! Hopefully it will help my anxiety since attivan isn't doing anything for me. I just hope I don't get too sleepy! Any recommendations from others on this medicine or combination of medicine? I couldn't comment on the overall satisfation or anything because I have never taken this medicine."

159$Manic-Depression$3/26/2008 4:16:31 PM$Reviewer: lislis777, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$5$"The initial 45 days on Invega was awesome, and the meds seemed to take affect rather quickly. I felt somewhat more manic than balanced,but, at least I was more positive in my thoughts/emotions. Than, because our society tends to think in terms of ""more is better,"" my therapist increased from 3 mg to the next level of 6 mg and, subsequently, I crashed and burned almost as immediately into the negatives as I had during initially taking the meds. After about 2-3 weeks of decreasing mood, depressions that I had not felt in a long time, I got word to him about the change and he told me to go back to the 3 mg. I did, but the negatives remained so I did the drastic and stopped altogether. However, I have been off them just 2 days, again with no change, but just retook my dose this second after reading all the rad success stories on here. I know meds act differently for each person, but I also know I am obnoxiously impatient and it is soooo difficult to wait out the meds before feeling better."

I was more positive and upbeat.  However the draw backs are that the effects seem to taper off QUICKLY at the end of the night, which works out because it seems to make me very tired at night.  Also I have noticed that I am very thirsty and rather cold(temp sensitive now) almost all the time. So I need to carry around a bottle of water and wear long underwear, and wrap up in blankets/sit near space heaters more often.
