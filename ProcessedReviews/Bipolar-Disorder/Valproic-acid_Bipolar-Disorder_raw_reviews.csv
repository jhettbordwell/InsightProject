6$Bipolar Depression$5/14/2015 2:37:14 AM$Reviewer: Olive, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$5$"I was prescribed this medication by my psychiatrist along with Cipralex (escitalopram) for anti-depression. I have since stopped taking both but while I was on them both I was very uncomfortable and I was far more mentally unstable. I was very aggressive and lethargic.

While escitalopram isn't listed as one of the drugs it can react with I would still say to be careful with it. At the time I was under 18 and I'd approximate about 130lbs, and 5'2"" if that helps. Sex is female."

I had to take it daily, and I was getting used to that. Manic state is more controlled now, but I hated the weight gain... I'm having difficulty losing it now. Anyway, for its primary use, it's effective.

13$Bipolar Depression$3/20/2014 7:12:09 PM$Reviewer: Sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Good drug except for weight gain and heartburn. Doc says it's the Remeron that causes the weight gain. I think it is the Remeron and the Valproic Acid. I take 500 mgs in am and 500 mgs at night.
20$Bipolar Depression$10/7/2012 6:55:53 AM$Reviewer: builderboy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$After years of fighting Depression the new Dr. tried this med and it started to work for the better. I didn't know I was bi-polar but my new wife did and she wasn't afraid to speak up as she too deals with depression.

Weight gain seems to be the most noticable side effect, 10-12 lbs., then infrequent fluctuations of approx. 5 lbs or so. I also take sertraline; buproprion, propranolol, trazodone. Mild side effects overall.
29$Bipolar Depression$5/18/2011 3:44:40 AM$Reviewer: Perty, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$Initially my mood was stabilized on this med for 5-6 months. About the 4-5th month I experienced swollen and painfulness in my right hand. It was easy to use in the liquid form.

Initially diagnosed with depression, subsequently altered to bipolar disorder.  Have been on 750 mg divided dose for several years, no significant side effects.  Went off medication for 3 months, had a manic episode characterized by wild overspending and other dangerous behaviors.  Resumed medication regimen and brought symptoms under control within 3 weeks.  I have had good success with this medication.

36$Bipolar Depression$9/17/2010 6:02:23 AM$Reviewer: Stephanie A., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$In the beginning this medication worked great for my Bipolar/ Manic Depression. My only complaint was the indigestion it gave me. I started gaining a lot of weight and my hair started falling out at around 4 months. I have gained 35 lbs in 5 months and lost over half my hair by the time my doctor told me to stop this medication. I had decreased my dose to 1/4 mgs until I could see her. This caused me to become more anxious than ever and began having bad anxiety attacks. Been off it for 2 weeks and my hair is still falling out really bad. My pharmacist suggested I take AG Pro (behind the counter at Wal-Mart but non-prescription). I am extremely unsatisfied with this medication and wish I had never started taking it.

This medication gives me bad heartburn. I also experience blurred vision after taking my meds. Not so much weight gain, but it does make my head feel a little funny.
62$Bipolar Depression$12/24/2007 10:23:08 AM$Reviewer: MTgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$1$I am Bipolar and have a seizure disorder.  I am frustrated that I have to take 10 - 250mg pills to get the correct does.  That's a lot of pills!  It is also the only medication I can afford.  I have hair loss and hand tremors.  I don't know about weight gain.  I don't think I can attribute all my weight gain to my meds.  I'm lazy.  I don't feel it controls all my bipolar symptoms and I don't want to increase my dose any further.  I would love to try something else with fewer pills that I could still afford.

Worked great on mood with pleasant side effect of deminished food intolerances. No more lactose intolerance etc. Downside it caused hands to swell and severe joint pain in already damaged knees. Changed to DIVALPROEX. Mood correction the same but food intolerance came back.

But this seemed to be the only generic brand of mood-stabilizer I could find and that's all my insurance would cover. I was on Depakote which is my preference.

I am never manic but find depression is an ongoing problem.  It also helps with chronic headaches which I used to get.  I find I have put some weight on but it was needed because I was underweight.  
8$Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$8/14/2014 5:45:36 PM$Reviewer: $5$5$5$"I could write a novel on Rx Bi-polar meds after dealing with bi-polar for over 20 yrs.  The true issue is preventing manic episodes.  Valproic is one of only 3 meds that do that well, and also stop them during a manic phase.  The meds work great for both!  I have been on and off them due to side effect concerns.  They are NOT good for your liver.  Your liver is a super organ that does so many things for you.  I have been off this med for over a year now.  I have no depression and no manic episodes.  Getting ALL nutrients, exercise, adequate sleep and avoiding STESS is key.  Bi-polar is not a disease, it is a nutrient deficiency that causes imbalances in neurotransmitters!  People dealing with ""bi-polar"" need ALL nutrients and it will go away.  These meds are invaluable to bring a manic episode under control, however, they due not ""cure the disease"".  The cure is nutrients...ALL of them!  The key nutrients for the neurotransmitters for bi-polar are: FOLATE (Not, absolutely not folic acid! Never consume folic acid!!), CHOLINE, IRON, B6, B12 all amino acids, & MAGNESIUM. Research on the net food sources for them, and consider supplements.  However, 99% of all ""vitamin supplements"" are not vitamins.  Even the ones at health food stores!  They are pharmaceutical grade analogs (PGA's).  They are horrible for your body, cause cancer, and do not work in the same way as REAL vitamins from REAL food.  If you research PGA's and how they make them and from what you will be horrified!  Do not put them in your body!  Instead, research ""real food source vitamin supplements"" and choose a good one.  The one I selected is from Sunwarrior company because it had the adequate levels and correct ratios of B vitamins.  I make a shake every morning with Gold Standard Whey protein powder, Twinlabs brewer's yeast, Spirulina, 1cup oatmeal softened in hog water, 1 frozen bannana, empty the herbs & supplements caps into it.  I eat only whole, non-gmo, real food. That's all nutrients in a glass!"

83$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$9/24/2010 1:17:25 AM$Reviewer: Heather Vogelsong, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $3$3$3$Honestly, can't... Only answered q.2 b/ci it was required. Would very much like to know if this would-be a good candidate for treating my manic episodes. Usually in fits and spurts, a good estimate would be 6 manic episodes per year max. They are however, lengthy and a pain to my husband and son as well, that they endure somehow... I take klonapin in a small dose every day as a means to help my mind wind-down and generally relax enough to fall asleep within 30 min or less rather then the 2-3 hours it normally can take. I also take fiorinal w/ codeine to combat stress-related migraines I suffer from at least once per week. I take that only when headache/migraine persists. What might be the best prescription drug to add to this carefully concocted cocktail of medications so far.
