The insomnia side effect is horrendous. Even with adding Ambien to the mix, I still would watch the sun rise. Also, the depersonalization side effect is pretty bad. I just didn't care about anything, and my passion for art was completely gone.

I won't ever take this medicine again. "

8$Bipolar Depression$12/12/2018 8:10:36 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$My response is to Susie! She began at a very high dose 100 mg. Lamictal has a black box warning. You need to carefully titrate up on it. Otherwise, you will get the famous Lamictal Rash. I cannot believe anyone would prescribe Lamictal like that carelessly to a patient!! I started out at 25 mg adding 25 each week till I got to my Theraputic Dose of 300 mg. Began when I was 45 and off and on ( I felt better, so I stopped, good grief!) I'm now 64 and glad to be back on the drug. It's great. Takes awful, is my only complaint.
10$Bipolar Depression$9/27/2018 10:31:17 PM$Reviewer: Jlb85, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking this medication for about a year and it's been very effective for me. It helps me feel more steady and stable, and avoid the constant highs and lows of bipolar. My doctor upped my dose when I began a severe bout of sleepwalking after coming off a strong sleep med. After increasing lamotrigine I stopped sleepwalking. My experience with the med has been nothing but good. 
11$Bipolar Depression$6/16/2018 4:21:54 PM$Reviewer: Suzie, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"I hate this medication! I'm 48 and was diagnosed as BP2 4 months ago. Started this med at 100mg, 2 weeks later, 150mg, 3 weeks later 200mg. I""ve had no sleep since starting this med. Because I've had such a horrific time sleeping, I've been so close to loosing my mind. Having hot flashes like crazy, had them slightly before due to being postmenopausal, but even then it was doable because I was not up all night tossing and turning. No sleep, weeping, and worsened depression. Actually thought I'd rather be dead. This sucks!!!!! I am weaning myself off, not sure I will trust any doctor after taking this shit. I was better off on Prozac, at least I didn't want to bite my spouse's head off, nor did I feel like I just wanted to die. This med has made me Bipolar! It's been the worst 4 months of my life, glad I'm still here to tell you not to take this. I quit my job, I nearly lost my marriage which was a gamble I was not prepared to take. Do not take this at high dosages if you can't handle it at the low dosage, you are taking a chance on making your  condition worse."

13$Bipolar Depression$5/13/2018 11:35:50 AM$Reviewer: DonnaRanetta, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$3$I just started this medication like 2 days ago. I just got diagnosed as bipolar and iâ??ve been suffering with depression for 10 years now. It started when I was 25 yrs old. I was told by my Dr to take this medication at night with my antidepressant which is Celexa. Iâ??ve been experiencing major headaches that lasts all day, nausea, vomiting and upset stomach. On top of that, I canâ??t sleep well. It had me up all night tossing and turning. Come Monday morning Iâ??m calling my Dr and hope she DC this and try me on something else. 
17$Bipolar Depression$11/24/2017 11:15:24 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken this medication for over 7 years now and  have found it to be very effective in treating my bipolar II.  I have not had any side effects (which is odd since with most meds that I have tried over the years nausea and stomach issues are usually the side effect that i get the most frequently).  When my Doctor and I finally came up with the medicine combo that worked for me I had been in a pretty rough state for over 2 years

Seemed to be working even at the starter dose. Then boom! Hives and severe itching. My Doctor told me to stop the drug if I had any skin reaction. So now I stopped it and I have crashed!  See the Doctor next week on to the next drug.

25$Bipolar Depression$4/4/2017 7:16:19 AM$Reviewer: Stomach pain and diarrhea! , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$I weaned myself off a heavy dose of zoloft after about 4 years. Depression just seemed out of control and just different. Got the bipolar depression diagnosis and started a low dose (25 MG daily at night) of lamotrigine. It's only been 4 days, my moods are definitely better but I have had the worst stomach cramping and diarrhea since the morning after my first dose. Here it is, 4:00 in the morning and I have been up all night with terrible stomach pains and diarrhea every hour. Please tell me this goes away soon!!
26$Bipolar Depression$3/1/2017 12:59:07 PM$Reviewer: jane, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$"I approached my doctor requesting treatment for ADHD and left with a prescription for generic lamotrigine to manage my moods.  I'm not bipolar, though; if anything I'm depressed, but my doctor latched onto the fact that once, about four years ago, I had a single and isolated ""manic-like"" episode that has never happened again.  

I've only been taking this a few months and have had my dosage increased once (25mg to start, 50mg currently). I realize that generally people don't experience any real change until the dosage is significantly higher, but if anything my ""mood disorder"" is worse and I've experienced several side effects since starting treatment with this.  

I'm more irritable and my already limited patience and temper are easier to lose than ever, to the point of rage, restlessness, and wanting to hurt people.  My nose has been congested for months in a way that has nothing to do with the season or allergies.  I have a constant minor headache and dry eyes--for a while, my upper eyelids would periodically twitch, but that stopped when my dose increased.  My skin is more sensitive and I'm ore prone to irritation than I was.  I already had issues with menstruation and they've gotten worse.    As I type this, I have a tightness in my chest that's only happened since I started taking lamotrigine.  I've had issues with urination, from not going enough and having difficulty going to needing to go so immediately I'm lucky I make it to the bathroom.  I'm fatigued and have occasionally severe insomnia and nightly vivid, sometimes upsetting dreams.  I have the same issues with concentration that I've always had, but I've become prone to trailing of mid-thought and misspeaking or being outright incoherent.  I'm not well-coordinated to begin with, but I've gotten worse as my grip has gotten weaker and my balance is off (I even walk differently now to compensate.  

My doctor insists I stay on and up my dose again to see if things change.  I don't want to take the chance."
31$Bipolar Depression$12/3/2016 5:55:55 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This has changed my life. I have been taking this for over three years and my wife continues to tell me how much of a difference she can tell in the severity of my mood swings. I really like the fact that I still feel myself when taking this medication.

34$Bipolar Depression$10/6/2016 3:39:52 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$5$4$"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II early this year after some years of being misdiagnosed with plain ol' depression.  One way I differ from the usual B2 person is that I've never really had suicidal thoughts - except on the Citalopram and Trazodone I'd been prescribed for depression!  I worked my way up on the Lamotrigine from 25mg daily to my current 200, with zero side effects, and a marked improvement in my mental state after about two months.  Unless your early experiences are really bad, as mine were with the SSRIs, be patient and let ""Vitamin L"" work its magic.  It's not perfect and my mood swings haven't completely disappeared, but I'm a lot easier to live with now, sleep better and am more optimistic.  I'll gladly take this for the rest of my life if that's what it takes.  It should be noted that I also quit drinking and smoking pot this year, and I'm sure there were many cross-benefits from that."

38$Bipolar Depression$6/18/2016 2:40:51 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II and Dysthimic Disorder about a month ago and was prescribed Lamictal (Lamotrigine). I'm now taking 100 mg a day and have gradually seen an awesome change. My mood swings aren't as extreme and it's helped a lot with the depressive symptoms as well. 
39$Bipolar Depression$5/1/2016 2:39:45 PM$Reviewer: Trinity, 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$1$This is one of the most difficult drugs to stop taking. I've been stepping down from 200mg/day over the last 3 years. 10 mg at a time. Takes a month of feeling like a complete idiot, with lots of drowsiness for me to start feeling better after reducing the dose... then you need another couple of months to restabilize. Glaxo lied in their first data sheet about effectiveness. Turns out that Lamictal/Lamotrigine is less effective than placebo. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. 
41$Bipolar Depression$4/1/2016 11:05:31 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been on this drug for a year just in the last 3 mos my dose was raise to 250 a day as I began feeling very manic.

42$Bipolar Depression$3/30/2016 10:18:08 PM$Reviewer: britbrit05tx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$4$I'm on week two of 25mg of this pill. In three days I will go up to 50 mg. the only change I've seen in my behavior is that it has gotten worse. I become irritated much easier than I did before I started taking this medication. I was diagnosed with bi polar and anxiety agitation. I hope there is a way to review again once my doses become higher. I'm giving this med a chance in hopes that it will help.
46$Bipolar Depression$1/6/2016 6:01:45 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$3$BP2. Coming off lithium I found myself more energetic and dynamic. At first I was having some serious suicidal ideation, but that passed. Now the problem is that I'm beset by a feeling of bleakness, on occasion. It's not entirely like depression, being without emotion or fear.
48$Bipolar Depression$11/8/2015 12:04:44 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$After quite a few years of a misdiagnosis and treatment for depression and/or ADD, I was accurately diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed Lamotrigine.  I have been taking 300mg for almost 10 years now, and I am thrilled with the level of stability I have experienced over these years.  Overall I'm very happy with my experience with this medication.
52$Bipolar Depression$10/15/2015 11:40:23 PM$Reviewer: Zach, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This is the first medication that has truly worked for my bipolar. Beforehand, I had bounced around many SSRI's and Anti-psychotics all to no avail. My psychiatrist finally decided to start me on Lamotrigine and since then, my quality of life has significantly improved. I now take 300mg/day and am very impressed with the results.
59$Bipolar Depression$4/26/2015 7:17:44 AM$Reviewer: Patient , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$Went off celexa for anxiety. Slowly worked up to 200 mg. felt like I was going to jump out of my skin with the first 200mg dose. It seems 9 hours after I take it I become very nauseous, and have diarrhea. Wake up out of a dead sleep, feel like I have the stomach flu. Cut down to 100mg, still feeling like that. First they gave me Lamasil (sp) to ease into full strength then the full dose was lamotrigine. No effects with Lamasil. Woke up this morning feeling sick, now I have a slight rash on my face and body.
61$Bipolar Depression$3/13/2015 4:18:54 AM$Reviewer: Fiona, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I am lucky that I have not had any side effects from this medication. For me it took a number of months to build up the effective dosage of 200mg per day.  However, despite the improvement due to Lamotrigine my mood (due to Bipolar II) has still been unstable.  So now I have just started on Seroquel XR.  Good luck and good health to all of you with bipolar disorder and remember MENTAL HEALTH IS TRICKY
64$Bipolar Depression$11/24/2014 8:31:23 AM$Reviewer: emme, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$After trying several medications that either didn't work or resulted in negative side-effects, lamotrigine has been working for me. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is because I have been at 200mg for less than a month and before I was at 100mg BUT I have noticed a difference with the increased dose and never a side-effect.
69$Bipolar Depression$10/7/2014 9:58:35 AM$Reviewer: squeakycellist, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$After 12 years of misdiagnosed bipolar depression and heavy side effects from fluoxetine and citalopram my new psychiatrist cured me in 6 weeks with lamotrigine. I wish this had happened years ago! First week I had tremors and the second-third my insomnia worsened, but symptoms subsided after 2-3 weeks. It really works!
70$Bipolar Depression$9/24/2014 8:31:17 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$"I have taken this drug since 2009; I was lucky that the first drug I tried for my mental illness has been so effective. I take 300 mg once a day. 

Though it is technically prescribed for manic depression (for insurance coverage/medical reasons) it is actually for Borderline Personality Disorder. 

It brings me, and my doctor, a lot of hope, because it is commonly believed that personality disorders cannot be helped with medication. My moods are more stable, and even though it hasn't had any 'magic effect', it's given me the foundation to work on my own problems without constantly feeling like my world is collapsing around me.

Warning for women: the interactions with birth control are VERY REAL. I spent a year and a half trying various combinations under my doctor's supervision, and every hormonal birth control option literally made me the most crazy I've been in my life-- crying constantly, suicidal, flipping out. I chose, in fact, to seek sterilization at a young age (for many reasons, but my need to stay on Lamotrogine is one of the primary ones).

As far as long term side effects, my hands shake noticeably at times, and it seems like my balance is a bit worse, though that might just be the effect of aging. It is also incredibly difficult and distressing to miss a dose: headaches, dizziness, and extreme mood swings.

Despite all of this, I am incredibly grateful for this drug. I didn't believe that a psych drug could ever change my life like this. It takes awhile to begin its effects but I would give it a chance if you have mood swing issues-- just take it consistently, at the same time each day."
71$Bipolar Depression$9/13/2014 3:12:59 PM$Reviewer: John Doe, 19-24 Male  (Patient) $5$5$5$I take Lamotrigine once daily at 200 MG Tabs. I have been taking the medication for about a year now along with ocarbazepine 600mg. (Oxcarbazepine: one tablet by mouth three times a day.) Only issue is I am up more than 15 hours a day.

93$Bipolar Depression$12/25/2013 10:30:41 PM$Reviewer: MadKate, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $4$5$2$I have taken Lamotrigine for 12 years now. Most of all, it seems to level my moods.  I take 400 mg at bedtime, along with 100mg of Zoloft, and during the day I take 300mg of Welbutrin. I wouldn't say I'm on top of the world, but I am in a stable place. The main concern I have is a side effect no one has reported. If I skip a dose, I start to have fuzzy thinking and feel uncoordinated. If I forget to take it at night, I have a very hard time waking up and I feel awful. If I go to work after skipping a dose, I have to have someone bring it to me, so that I won't get disoriented and anxious. I don't like that aspect of this drug at all. I've been on it long enough to know that these side effects are produced by Lamotrigine, not another medication.

I quite taking it ... was great for a month ... and then WHAM ... major depression.  Right now I am trying to cope with a hypomanic state (just yesterday I did something potentially hurtful & feel just terrible about it today) while I wait to once again reach the theraputic dose.

I learned my lesson!! I will never agin get off this wonder drug!!

I hope that someone who is successfully taking this drug will read this and learn from my bad experience.  STAY ON YOUR MEDS!!

""oh, it'll work pretty soon, just wait until you get a higher dosage."" funny story, i'm at 200mg and it does absolutely nothing. it's inhibited a lot of my creativity and taken out a big chunk of my mental capacity, but it really hasn't done anything. i still have suicidal ideation, and the only thing stopping me is not wanting to hurt my family. however, if depressed enough, that does not matter because my body automatically tries to end it's suffering, so it's really very important that i have something blocking all levels of depression. all it does is stop me from being manic, which, personally, i'd rather be manic all the time than depressed. now i have to stop cold turkey because my psych canceled my appointment, and i've been off one day and have started hearing voices and feeling presences at night and having panic attacks. i don't know, this might mean i'm schizoaffective but whatever. this drug was a pain to get on (constant nausea, pounding headaches, and at times severe crippling depression) and at this point my body has developed a very strong aversion to taking it. im going to a new psych next week to get evaluated. this drug sucks."

Until the dose steadied out I felt unsteady, even worse than unmedicated. After getting to the therapeutic dose and staying there for a while, things got better. My wife notices an enormous difference. I still am occasionally hypomanic, but any depression I have is very short-lived and not as severe as before. This is not a good drug for children, from what I read.
128$Bipolar Depression$11/12/2012 8:38:57 AM$Reviewer: deadladytalking, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$After trying several antidepressants and lithium, the doctor prescribed lamotrigine/lamictal and wellbutrin/bupropion which has helped alot. lithium didn't help at all and caused rapid weight gain once i reached 1000mg (theraptutic level)and thyroid problems and was still depressed even depite trying celexa, citopram, and wellbutrin combined with the lithium. discouraged, i went in and asked to be taken off my drugs and she said to try this before making such a hasty decision and it worked! lamictal took away my anger/aggression and depression slightly so she prescribed wellbutrin to help with the depression and it was a life changer! it takes a while to reach a theraputic level (over a month) but with each week, i felt better. what people have to remember is that each drug effects different neurotransmitters in your brain and each person is different. plus, people are more likely to review when they're disatisfied, rather than happy so that also screws witht he rating. I say try it and see if it helps! I take mine before i want to go to sleep and you do get drowsy but when i wake up that doesn't effect me as much. wellbutrin is also a stimulant so that may be another factor. start with a low dose (25mg) and increase weekly by 25 mg to lessen the chance of getting the rash which is rare. before this drug, i wanted to kill myself and was very angry and depressed despite being on lithium which most bipolar people find effective; just not me. each person is different. be willing to try different drugs or combinations and be patient because there is a theraptuic level you have to reach.

Noticed a difference in just 2 days off limictal so must have been the med. Starting new med today, hope it goes well!

I moved to Lamictal/Lamotrigine as per my Pdoc. As I moved up in dosage I began to notice that I no longer had issues w/getting out of bed or feeling suicidal. I no longer felt the need or want to drink, I could sit in bars w/my buddies and be happy w/out having a round or two or five! I no longer looked for sex everywhere I could find it.

I initally got prescribed this as a mood stabalizer. I get hypo-manic, and was never willing to get on a mood stabalizer untill I realized the older I get, the worse my depressions get. So my prescriber told me that lamictal would keep my depressions from getting SOO low, and keep my mania from getting TOO high. 

I don't really know if it's working, because I still get pretty depressed for long periods of time. Many just not as bad as it use to be, but not really noticeable either. I find myself unable to take this medication, unless I have a few hours in my day free where I know I don't have to exert myself or keep my eyes open. Waste of frickin time. "

Unlike some others, it has worked well in controlling my symptoms. I feel balanced. I experienced multiple major depressive events starting in my 30's which I treated by indulging in alcohol. Eventually I tried every SSRI on the market, Wellbutrin, Trazadone and several others. These made me manic and caused severe insomina. After taking lamotrigine for a couple or years, I began having panic attacks. My doctor added Xanax. It was the perfect combination and the most effective treatment to date. One thing is important - don't use drugs or alcohol if you expect to get the full benefits of this product. I haven't had a drink for 3+ years and this was the key to achieving maximum effectiveness. Substance abuse is a problem with many of us with bipolar depression. If that is a factor, you have to deal with that as part of the treatment plan. Not always easy to do, but worth it. I was teetering between a good life and losing it all. I didn't lose my life. Identifying the right combination of drugs and a good psychiatrist is key to finding the right thing for you. I take 300 mg per day - 150 mg morning and night with 50 mg Xanax at the same time. No side effects.

223$Bipolar Depression$9/8/2010 11:16:13 PM$Reviewer: BusyMom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$After years of being prescribed anti-depressants with limited success this is the first time I have felt a significant difference in how I felt upon reaching therapeutic dose.  I finally felt motivated to get out of bed and do things, which usually didn't happen at all unless I had a structured event to go to.  I could get up and get going for specific situations and then I would fall back into a slump.  It is an amazing feeling to want to get up and not have to drag myself out of bed.  I was still experiencing bouts of tearfulness on a daily basis--which I almost didn't mind because I finally felt better for the most part.  I was recently prescribed Geodon to help with this, only I don't notice much of a difference--if any.  I have learned that this is just the kind of thing I really need to communicate with my doctor on.  Until you find something that actually works sometimes you feel bad because you are taking a medication and you can't really tell if it is doing anything.  That was not the case with Lamictal for me.  I am afraid I will have to take it my whole life and it is really expensive.  I don't want to go off it since it helps, only depending upon my insurance coverage I may not be able to afford staying on it.

I was easy to get along with and had so little anxiety that I had no fear even when in situations that normally made me go into panic attack mode. However, I was always tired and exhausted my entire life before taking this drug. So when on this drug I was so tired that I could only sit and stare and not get much done during my day. I was in a zombie like state. Also it made me exrtremely forgetful. I missed 4 appointments in 2 months and I NEVER forget appts. I was just NOT motivated to do anything. It might be great for you if you have no probs with energy level. But for me the side effects were not worth it. I was taken off of it and use the aplenzin ER 348 for ADHD and it helps with Biolar depression as well.

I started this medicine 4 years ago and have suffered insomnia ever since. I was prescribed to take it at night. 3 years ago the insomnia became worse- lasting up to 4-5 days at a time.  I NEVER SHUT DOWN - not even the following day.  I tried everything on the market: behavioral modification (dark room, etc), all the drugs listed on this website for insomnia. Finally, after forgetting to take it for a couple of nights, I was able to sleep normally.  I tried, as a last resort, to take it in the morning only - AND TO MY RELIEF AND ELATION MY INSOMNIA WAS CURED! I take the medicine first thing in the morning now and it gives me a the same buzz as taking vitamin B.  I am tired at night like I am supposed to be and sleep like a baby.  I actually dream now whereas before I laid awake all night listening to every sound.  Apparantly, because this side effect is so rare - no doctor I saw could identify the cause of my insomnia.  I write this for those of you out who suffered like me with insomnia for years with no relief.

Took about 6 months for depression to catch me again.Then they put me on Wellbutrin which was horrible because I was a zombie. Now they have me on lamotrogine to ""get me back on track"". As others have mentioned here, I have that dizzy, headache and overall tired feeling thats now effecting my job.

It became acute in the beginning of February -- extremem vertigo (falling, vomiting) and horrible headaches.  I have missed so much work that I am now on STD until it gets under control.  After multiple (expensive) tests I am now seeing a (??? balance PT) to retrain my brain.  It didn't even occur to me (or any of the doctors) that this drug may be the cause until I went for my pre-scheduled follow-up appointment with my psychiatrist who subscribed the drug.  the Dr. is now titrating me off the drug within the next 10 days.  I am bummed because Lamictal worked so well (after suffering for over 20 years) and I am told it could take me up to three months to re-train my brain to regain my balance and stop this vertigo!!

I used to take lithium which required blood tests once a month due to the fine line between toxic and theraputic levels. So, sometimes, I would go off of it because it was such a hassle. But with lamictal, I don't have to worry about that. I have not experienced any side effects. I am also taking effexor to control the depression. The combination of both of these meds has been a real blessing. I have never felt better. I would encourage any one who has been diagnosed with manic-depression or bipolar illness to talk to their doctor about lamictal.

I began taking Lamictal after being diagnosed for agitated depression. I started on the sample kit prescribed to me from my psychiatrist. 13 days into beginning the starter kit my Lymph nodes began to swell. I got a red itchy rash all over my body. I didnt begin to think this was a serious problem until my fever reached 105 degress F. I was taken into ER and the red rash was all over my body. The pain in my lymph nodes was so bad that i was precribed darvocet for the pain. The symptoms died down after a week. The ER stated I had a strepp infection and was given an amoxocilin antibiotic. After completing the antibiotic I was told by my Psych to begin taking the Lamictal at day 14 were I left off. I took the Lamictal at 830 in the morning by 10 am I was taken to the ER for an alergic reaction. I am partial to all medications for I can help people however, This particular medication almost landed me in my death bed...
Good luck"

Iâ??ve watched every lamictal you tube video review, and read every article online I can find, and continue to worry this drug was prescribed to me incorrectly by a psychiatrist who saw me for the first time for literally only 5 minutes. I donâ??t even know if he thinks Iâ??m bipolar. I told him how I felt, he wrote me a script for this, and I was out the door. I went home to research the drug, and panicked more by the side effects I read. He told me there were no side effects with lamictal! What a lie. He said itâ??s the gentlest of all of these types of drugs. I know I have GAD anxiety 
363$Bipolar Depression$8/8/2019 3:37:20 PM$Reviewer: Elle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have bipolar II disorder. I stopped medication for about 3 years because I felt myself stabilizing. I never had any major episodes, but I tend to be more hypomanic than depressed. I decided to start taking medication again because although I could function, it was a daily struggle to manage my moods.
More mature and in tune to my mental health, I communicated my needs and concerns to my new psychiatrists. Like I said, Im more manic, so in the past when doctors prescribed me an anti-depressant, it would make me even more anxious and irritable. I also did not want a medication that caused weight gain because I have had an eating disorder in the past and didnt want weight gain to trigger that.
My doctor recommended lamictal (only). He gave me the ""rash"" warning and told me I may not feel better for a few weeks while he slowly increases my dosage...
I am completely astounded! I have only been taking lamictal for a few days, so Im not sure why he says it takes weeks. I have not even taken it for 2 weeks and I have so much energy and motivation. I have cleaned my apt (long overdue), got school supplies early, usual stressors at work dont phase me! 
It is not a medication that makes you feel super joyful or too dim. I feel like it just lifts the bipolar cloud from your life. I just feel like I can fully function! Everybody is different, but if your mental situation is similar to mine, definately give lamictal a try!

FYI...I dont remember ever reviewing a medication. Hope this helps someone! God bless you."

I had given up on finding medication to help me and was looking into ect therapy. My nurse practitioner recommended lamictal, I was so skeptical but agreed to try it. After a couple of weeks paired with my other medications I could see a difference in my mood and energy levels. I had feelings of happiness and before it was only flat affect or sadness. I was very resistant to touch prior to the lamictal, with the addition of the medication, my touch aversion went almost completely away. Dont get me wrong, I take several other psyc medications, but the addition of lamictal was a big game changer for me.

It helped significantly with my mood swings and anger/mania and I actually loved the effect it had for helping with stabilizing me in general. The side effects unfortunately were too difficult for me to deal with. I gained 30 pounds in three weeks, from the medication as I was retaining too much water and sort of swelled up. It also didn't really help my anxiety and caused panic attacks when I was feeling more depressed than normal.

My pharmacist recognized them in 3 sec. when she looked at my med list. The drug turned my brain to Jello. I will list them in no particular order.  Getting lost for <30 miles while going to dr. Going to church on Tues. at midnight, falls with fractures, needing a cane then a walker, double vision, blurred vision, (of course no driving),slurred and very slow speech, limited vocabulary and problems with word finding, confusing, memory loss,severe tremors--total body, 5-7 day a week home care and physical therapy because I could not maintain my personal care.  My life consisted of eat, sleep(most of the time, pee and go to the dr.  This past year was complete hell.  Both drs. told me I was just anxious and this symptoms were part of my mental disorder.  I weaned myself off and the switch flipped after 3 days and improved by ? in 7 days. Stevens-Johnson isn't the only problem that drs. need to watch for (look beyond the black box warnings!), Patients need to listen to what your body and R.Ph tells you.  Both drs. dropped their jaw when I skipped into their offices.

I have not been sleepy or groggy as many of the anti-depressants made me. I also do not feel any changes in appetite like the anti-depressants seemed to make me eat more. I sleep well and have not had dreams that were anymore weird than usual, as some people have stated they had weird dreams on lamictal. I have had a hard time getting up early, I was getting up at 4:30 a.m. but struggle to get out of bed for work because I am resting so well- this could be a good or bad thing, less anxiety but late to work. I do not have racing thoughts and even manage to smile and laugh during the day which is rare for me. In addition, I am getting things done without all of the worry and anxiety. So far so good Lamictal. I will post another update when I increase to 50 mg on 12/29/2015

Been in this at various doses for over 2 years.  With my other meds, it has worked better than anything I've ever taken, for my major depression, bipolar.  About a year ago i complained to my Dr. About the very uncomfortable feeling in my legs, that happened often, and I couldnt do anything to stop the episodes.  Caused me to pace, couldn't sit still it lie down. It was fidgety leg syndrome, (sounds minor, but it's not when its not ESP when it is occurring frequently). She put me on cogentine for the side effects.  I don't have fidgety legs anymore.  I've had a terrible dry mouth that makes it very difficult to talk, or swallow.  My legs tighten up with my feet in a curled up position, very tightly, while lieing down.  While standing, my calves are very still tight and my big toe on my left foot stats extended upward and all other toes in a cramped position.  It is almost constant, as much as I try to relax or stretch it doesn't go away.  I've told my dr of this many times and she continues to lower my dose of Lamictal and its 'side effect cure"" cogetin.  Still there, but very much improved.  No improvement on my tightened legs, feet  and body at  I don't know what to do.  Not sure which is causing it, and since my depression has improved so much, (with the help of meds and very intense therapy).  These side effects are to difficult to ignore and to deal with. "

435$Bipolar Depression$1/25/2015 3:51:03 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Lamictal is great for using in conjunction with other forms of antidepressants. Some SSRIs/SNRIs give you too much energy and actually make your urges more difficult to tolerate. If you take this as a stand alone for mood disorders then you will be disappointed. It is the safest alternative to any other mood disorder drug. Sad to hear other people's issues while taking Lamictal.

I take it in the mornings with my Cymbalta 60mgs and Adderall 20mgs. Today I started 50mgs of Lamictal and I have had the weirdest changes in mood all day long until finally settling into this reeeallly drowsy state where all I want to do is lay in bed. I can't focus on anything and my afternoon dose of Adderall was pretty much wasted because I still couldn't focus due to being so tired.

I've read that most people don't REALLY start feeling less swings until 100mgs, and that the therapeutic dose is 200mgs. So I am going to stick it out and I have a psych appointment tomorrow to get his opinion. But today has been rough and I'm out of klonopin until tomorrow as well because we recently lowered that significantly. 

I'm hoping this really weird drowsy/tired/sleepy/no motivation/no energy/no emotions/blah/netflix-binge mood is not how this medicine will make me feel for very long. I didn't really notice any effects at 25mgs, but today, my first day on 50mgs has been rough. Had a panic attack earlier and then settled into this mood.

I've been struggling with mood swings for a long time, but I never sought treatment. I assumed what I was going through was the normal wear and tear of life, but it wasn't. My mood swings started affecting my life, from my job, to my relationship with my new wife. I talked to my doctor about my mood swings and he recommended Lamictal. Since I started taking the medication a month ago I have literally not had a single mood swing. I feel happier than I have in years. If you want a medication that works and gives absolutely no side effects then this is the medication for you! (duh)
443$Bipolar Depression$10/17/2014 10:49:26 PM$Reviewer: pennylaine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I have only been on Lamictal for 4 days now. I'm also on Cymbalta 60mgs, Xanax .5mgs at night to help my mind stop racing so I can sleep, and Adderall 20mgs 2x a day. Also prescribed Trazadone if I feel like I need it but I hate taking it. Anyway, back to Lamictal, my psych instructed me to take 25mgs 1x daily for 2 weeks. This is day 4 and it seems like it is making me more depressed and just really irritated and blah feeling especially in the late afternoon/evenings. I have been on all of these other medications in the past and never had an issue with any of them. Lamictal is the only new thing added to that cocktail. After the 2 weeks are up, I go to 50mgs a day. I just feel kinda apathetic, annoyed, and very low energy at night and I take it in the mornings with my Cymbalta and Adderall. I need to call my psych Monday to ask if I should push through these first 2 weeks or what... Anyway, that's my experience so far. Hope it changes. I used to be on Abilify for bipolar and never had any problems with it... Maybe he'll switch me back but from what I understand, that's a completely different category of drug. Any input anyone???

In December 2010 I attempted suicide and was placed in an intensive outpatient treatment program. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and Anxiety Disorder and was put on Lamictal and Xanax (.50 mg). My therapeutic level for the Lamictal was/is 150mg (200mg caused difficulties sleeping). The Lamictal helped with the depression and ""dark thoughts"". I was on the meds from December 2010 - March 2012 and got cocky and decided I was cured and didn't need the meds anymore (not realizing the truth the meds were doing what they were suppose to do).  At first I was fine but by November 2013 things began spinning out of control with my depression and hypo mania. In May 2014 I was so distraught and spiraled down again that I left work went home and cut myself 17 times. Once again I was back in intensive outpatient treatment but for longer this time. I was put back on the Lamictal the end of May 2014 and once again the ""dark thoughts"" have subsided and I am feeling stronger again (and have managed to deal with four deaths of friends the past three weeks and though my emotions were grief and pain which are expected, the out of control bleakness has not occurred). I have had to come to terms that I will always require med management for my disorder and can not go off my meds again as my ""experiment"" of being fine without them was a complete failure. I am not saying everyone will experience the same results and obviously by the mixed reviews many have not. All I know is after 36 years of medication experimentation Lamictal has proven to be the one which was by far the most effective for me!  (FYI - I experienced no side effects other than sleep difficulties at 200 mg and so it was readjusted back to 150 mg which has proven the best level for me.)"

After visits with 5 different doctors, including being sent home by an ER doctor, they finally decided her skin rash was Steven Johnsons/TENS and flew her to a burn center.  She lost over 100% of her skin, spent weeks on a ventilator, has had multiple surgeries, including skin grafting, and experiences severe and constant pain. She was young and strong and will be fortunate enough to escape this experience with only extensive scaring, dry eyes, and hypersensitivity to cold and heat. She is also at high risk for lifelong pain sensitivity and chronic fatigue.  These side effects are obviously unacceptable and will change her life forever.

I was taking risperdol, zoloft and Xanax, but was still very depressed. It was to the point that I had stopped eating preppy and could not take care of myself hygienically. I didn't care how I looked, if my coo these were dirty, or if I smelled. I only took a shower every 10-14 days. Basically until I couldn't stand myself any longer and got afraid of being in trouble at my part time job. I finally talked to my doctor about all of this and she put me on lamictal. After four weeks I was on 100mg per day. The difference is night and day. I eat well, take care of myself, and no longer have to worry about my cleanliness. Sometimes I still struggle with the energy to do things I need to do, but for the most part am doing very well. I am taking the lamictal in addition to all the meds listed ate the beginning, even my friend says I am more perky and have a more positive outlook on things instead of being so negative all the time. My dr said I could go up some from where I am if I need to, which I think I can do, but I am feeling emotion again which I haven't done in a long time, Ian very thankful for this drug s it has turned my life around,

I take it mainly for depression, but since reaching perimenopause age, I have a bit of bipolar symptoms.  It is slightly less effective for control bipolar systems such as hyper/hypomania, weight gain, and fatigue.  I do get dizzy more often, and am extremely thirsty all the time (I drink a LOT of water, but I feel like that's healthy). I also notice headaches when I don't take it for a few days. I'm on 350 mg, and it is a right dose for me.  I do also have insomnia, which is not related to the drug by perimenopause. I, however, don't get NEAR as depressed as I used to, and for that I am eternally greatful to the psychiatrist who started me on Lamictal.  I think I'll be taking this drug for a long time, as it really has made my life outlook SO much better.

I was placed on Wellbutrin first, and it improved my mood and energy level.  However, I was still irritable, explosive, quick to anger and intolerant. My doctor put me on 25 mg of Lamictal, and I felt different immediately.  I felt more centered, patient, calmer and mellow.  My employees and husband also noticed the difference in my mood. I went up to 50 mg and, eventually, to 75 mg, my current dose.  I am on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, Wellbutrin SR 100 mg and Lamictal 75 mg.  this combination has changed my life.  I think and communicate more intelligently, and I am more level-headed.  It hasn't changed my personality.  It just stabilized my mood swings. The only side effect since I started Lamictal is forgetfulness.  I was told that folic acid may minimize that.  I'll give it a try. Besides that, I'm extremely happy with Lamictal.

Check and make sure you take it at the exact same time everyday and you will see the headaches lessen.

He started on 25mg and now 75mg and will start 100mg on the 16th.  He's basically very depressed.  He was on Effexor and Seroquel (400mg XR) for some time but developed some breast tissue on the nipple area.  So he stopped Seroquel and started Lamictal as mood stabilizer. After stopping Seroquel, the breast tissues are still there.  The Psychiatrit said there is no the same side effect on boy growing breasts for Lamictal.  However, from some web sites, I saw a lot of women talking about their breasts were signigicantly enlarged for a couple of cups. I also read 2 posts saying one 13-year-old boy and a middle-aged man discribing they have gynecomastia.  Could anyone shed light on this problem?  Is there any document indicating this is a side effect?  Do you have any experience with it?  Seroquel can increase the prolactin level.  I am not sure if Lamictal has the same side effect but works in a different way (estrogen, etc.).  I did read that Effexor has the same side effect but very rare. I only hope my son's problem is not getting worse with the treatment.

Am now up to 150 mg and my p said that's where I'm going to stay for a while to see how it goes. I have noticed my glands are swollen a little in my neck, and I got a small mouth sore on my gum but it went away on its own. Yesterday I had severe muscle spasm in my legs on the verge of complete muscle failure in the calves more specifically. The headaches went away in week 2. No weight gain significant. Bad tummy when I don't eat for over 4 hours or so, and I get extreme thirst at times. I'm seeing my p next week, I will discuss the muscle pain, since it seems to be the most severe issue so far. Can barely walk today due to muscle fatigue out of no where. Sleeplessness for short times, but HOORAY, no agitation or moodiness for 4 weeks now. I'm really proud to know that I'm not an angry depressive person all the time. I'm making art again, writing music....it has given me back ""Me"" back before depression was an issue."

I took this for years and was greatly affected by a little-known(but stated in the literature)very bad side effect. Extreme Vitamin D deficiency, which caused profound depression, low energy and lowered immunity. As someone who struggles with depression I could see my depression was not connected to events. The literature indicates that this drug produces liver enzymes hostile to vitamin D. THAT is a problem! I had a level 5.5, should of been 36 or so. That depression-crying for no reason at work!& compromised immunity, extreme fatigue is not uncommon. Follow bipolar groups and you will find a pattern of extreme depression when patients start on it oftentimes. Alot of them complain about it. Be CAREFUL.

It started helping after a short period of time. I got up to the recommended dose (100mx 2x daily), it helped a ton, but was not quite there... I wend through a short cycle of depression, the pdoc upped my Wellbutrin, I went into mania so he lowered it back down, then I was on the low side. He upped the Lamictal to 150 mg 2x daily, and I have been great (please note, that is not a recommended dose for Lamictal used for bipolar, but is well under that which can be prescribed for seizures, he raised it after consulting with other psychiatrists in his office). It has worked well with my particular cocktail to stabilize my bipolar symptoms. -Wellbutrin XL 300 mg (in am) -Seroquel 100 mg (in pm) -Lamictal 300 mg (15 mg 2x / day)

The bad: This medication never fails to cause me severe headaches whenever I drink even a single beer or glass of wine. The headaches start shortly after drinking the beverage and typically last until the next morning. The headache pain is not lessened by taking over the counter pain relievers. Although I've never had more than 2 beers at one sitting (well, during adulthood anyway!), I do enjoy having them on occasion. I've switched to O'Doul's but I'm pretty fed up with the situation. At least I didn't get the rash!

I have Bipolar 1, so they say, but I've never been manic, I just have deep depression and deeper. I am better then I was prior to 2001. I could not move. leave the house or shower. I sleep as much as I could. I did not want to live - but I didn't harm myself. I couldn't socialize. I was petrified. Now, I work, care for the home & boys and shower often. But I stay in my small office, alone,  all the time. I do not have fun, I can't. Confusion & short term memory loss. Horrible fears and nervousness. Afraid of phone and mail. No ambition no sex. Want to get off med but it's hard, makes you sick. I'm sure Lamictal is helping I just might not be able to help. I've had many traumas, baby died, had stoke,lost best job, lost wife, kids arrest, wife narcissistic, bankrupt. One thing after another, no peace, no money now after wife left headed for homeless.

Before taking this med I was living with so much emotional agony and strife...terrible mood swings, chaotic relationships, could not hold a stable job,etc. I finally hit rock bottom and saw a psychiatrist. Was initially scared to take meds because of the scary potential side effects. But I was willing to try anything to save my life & sanity!!! Within ONLY 2 days of taking 25 mg I felt much, MUCH better. Very calm ,without the erratic mood swings. Now I am up to 50 mg daily and feel even better. My boyfriend was on the verge of breaking up with me before lamictal, he just could not handle my raging mood swings and verbal abuse. Now we are happy and finally have a loving,healthy relationship!!! THIS MEDICINE IS A GODSEND!!!! AI RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS SUFFERING IN MISERY AND WANTS TO FINALLY ACQUIRE INNER PEACE.

Terrible weight gain and brittle teeth from dry mouth are side effects I have. Also on cymbalta, risperdal, ativan and narcotic pain meds.  Lamictal seems to help with craving the narcotic if I am trying not to take too much.  Sometimes feel like a hollow shell when something happens that I should be reacting to.

I know I was more brave, more outgoing. I guess I had to give up the highs to lose the lows though. My memory is pretty shitty and a bit concerning. I'm always hungry and my body temperature is always around 99.5. Not sure if this is all related to Lamictal but I thought I should mention it.

(Once it caused me to fall off a curb and the second time I made a fool of myself trying to walk down the concourse in a large air port.) Both times the episodes (three years apart) seemed to have to do with how little food I had eaten that morning prior to taking Lamictal. My first psychiatrist took me off the drug altogether and then put me back on it when I was experiencing deep and long depression. After the second episode of losing coordination, my new psychiatrist wrote down ""low blood sugar"" with no discussion.

I fought dx because of no manic (whoo hoo, happy) moods, then was told it was due to my anger & the depression was so deep it was very hard to come out of. I was put on Adderall with no side effects. It does get me out of bed in the am. My husband calls Lamictal the miracle drug. That's because he was on the receiving end of my anger rants & they were really bad! I was doing great with my medication for a while, but I can't afford therapy & it is a daily struggle to keep myself motivated. I do get unscheduled motivation, what I call ""A bug up my ..."" & I go until I can't, but they are far & few in between. I think I need an increase in my Lamictal.

I do, however, feel a bit 'weepy' at times, somewhat like PMS.  Not sure if that's depression or a side effect. I have noticed that my eyes are red, itchy and burning-- almost like conjunctivitis-- and I'm very dehydrated. The itchy eyes may be due to allergies (of which I have many) but it popped up as soon as  I started this medication.  I will most likely discontinue since I don't want to run the risk of messing with my vision and I am also quite concerned about 'The Rash' that appears to be not as rare as I thought. My coordination and memory is also a bit wonky and my appetite has increased.   

I gained a TREMENDOUS amount of weight (in addition to other unbearable side effects, like drooling, nervous movements, non-existent cognitive abilities) whilst on other psychotropic drugs 18 years ago, which led to my discontinuing all medications until recently after my symptoms became more troublesome.  

I am therefore quite wary of psychiatrists and psychiatric drugs."

Increased to 400mg sometime after that...I don't remember. But it saved me! Was a total god send. But now I think it's not as effective as it use to be. Started on lithium about 8 months ago, right after I was layin in the road making an attempt, and went to jail. At that point I started seeing a psychiatrist...that's when I started the lithium. Guess the combo at least keeps me off the pavement and out of jail...good god.

I have been taking it for 4 years. It has helped in use with my anti-depression medication (prozac) to stabilize my mood swings. In the last few months, the side effects of the mood swings has recurred. That is why my doctor doubled my Lamictal from 300mg per day to 600mg. I have been on the increased dose for about 3 weeks. It has definitely lessened my mood swings.

Was taking Cymbalta before that. Lamictal is the better of the two. The side effects certainly occur but I consider them annoying, nothing more. I listed them in case you may think your side effects are unusual. Side effects (for me) include: Have experienced a slight back-of-the tongue swelling. Can't climb a ladder. Very emtional eg cry at the drop of a hat. Have to sleep every few hours. Vomitting during a meal every couple of weeks or days. Extreme laziness is almost constant. Summary: Love this drug. My actions were unpredictable before taking Lamictal.

The doctors added Lamictal and Seroquel. The Seroquel was horrid! Had an unsatiable appetite and gained over 30 pounds in a short time. We discontinued the Seroquel, and now just on the Lamictal. The appetite is back to normal but still struggling to lose wieght. I feel more stable now than I have in years. I don't know if the Lamictal is an adherent to my weight loss efforts. Sometimes I get an eerie/dizzy type feeling but it passes quickly. My memory seems to have dulled somewhat and I can't always find the right word I am looking for, but other than that, I think this drugs benefits have outweighed the perceived side effects. I sleep better and can get up in the mornings now so much easier. I wish someone knew the long term effects of this drug. I hate taking meds, but I guess this one is a winner cause I don't feel like running or committing suicide any more. My family is sure happier with me.

My doctor put me on Lamictal, and it's much easier to control. They figure I have bipolar II. When I first began the medication, I would type entire wrong words. It was kind of strange, but only lasted a month. Maybe a little clutziness too. The only complaint was that it made it where I couldn't get very deep sleep. It's like the lights were on 24/7. After a year, my doctor lowered my dosage of Lamictal and put me on something to help me sleep. It's been good ever since.

This is the one that I have difficulty 'feeling', as was explained to me by my doctor before being prescribed it.

Yes, new patients start low and work up...for me, I boosted it by about 50mg weekly until I got to 350mg, which is where I am currently at but my psychiatrist may boost it a little more. 

I am satisfied with the somewhat stealthy nature of this medication's effects, as this means that the side effects don't feel there at all. I took quite a few mood stablizers in the past and noticed unpleasant side effects; mainly related to energy and mental numbness. 

I feel like I need to be on this a little longer to really gain more wisdom about it (it's been around 5 months for me now), but so far I have had no reason to want to go off of it, and I am no stranger to mood stabilizers..."

I have regualar depression and anxiety.  A new psychiatrist put me on Lamictal. Said it work on uni-polar depression(that being me)I Icould ony get up to 75mg..100mg casued sever agitation. So I return to my original psychitrist for other reasons. ( the new psychiatrist was going to put me on ENSAM patch while taking cymbalta..= seratonin syndrone..Original psychiatrist knew about that too. ALSO she told me that taking Depakote and Lamictal = TOXIC..I am on 500mg Depakote bedtime, 125mg Depakote am. SO for now she is weaning me off the lamictal..Originall Shrink had me on ZOLOFT. It worked + .50mg Ativan..1mg Klonipin..I was fine, stable, able to handle things in calm manner, shower, drive, etc..I had not a wisper of anxiety since 2007 to March 2010. Shrink bullied me into takng Prozac..I can' take Proazac- get adverse reaction--head goes spinning out of control at 15mg. SHRINK said lower it to 10mg and BAM hit with dreadful ANXIETY. Then Zoloft gave me ANXIETY after swithced.THen another new shrink - puts me on 5-6mg Ativan/day. DX: Severe anxiety. Finally went back to origina shrink and was put on CYMBALTA..It finally greatly reduced anxiety,stil had to take about 3mg throught out day..So I have been screwed up since May 2010. Not stable at all. I REFUSED the Prozac BUT before I coud get out the most imp. info. SHRINK ambused me, Prozac,etc,etc ..I never got to tell her I took it before and I pill made my head go crazy..due to the immediate ambush. SO I have been in hell for 1year,3months. I don't trust SHRINKS anymore. I don't know what is to become of me. For those of you who have had sucess on Lamictal, I'm happy for you..Very worrid (understatement) about me. YOu don't  know what it is like to feel normal & functioal on a medication, then have your shrink bully you into med (Prozac) that has caused me to have prmanent anxiety BEAUSE shrink ambushed me before I could say: I got adverse reaction from Prozac before.

I recently began lamictal in treatment of bipolar disorder. I had been on SSRI antidepressants since around the age of 20. I thought they were working, but yet, I was still extremely depressed, anxious, and unpredictable in my behaviors. I cried all the time, became angry frequently, and felt out of control emotionally. I struggled to keep a job for longer than a year, stay in my marriage, stay focused on any one thing, or have any semblance of a balanced, healthy life. I was only ever offered SSRIs and I thought my life experience was the best it was ever going to be. I was addicted to cigarettes, alcohol, and food. 

I didn't realize how bad I actually was, until I started using the lamictal product in January of this year. Suddenly, who I was completely changed. This is my best self - the person I never imagined that I could be. 

My whole life has changed in ways I never thought possible. I don't feel so overwhelmed and tortured with guilt or depression. I am successful at work, I purchased my own home, I lost 50 lbs, and I am stable in many, many ways I never thought possible. I do attribute this to lamictal, because of the immediate and significant changes that I have experienced. The simple addition of this medication in my life has made these things possible. 

If I had known the person I could be under these conditions, things in my life would have been very different for years. I do not regret the past, as it is in the past, but I do look forward to my future so very very much more than I ever have.

I have been able to start my life over in a more productive and healthy manner. I cannot say enough about this drug - it has saved my life.

That being said, I love Lamictal.It's like a gift from God.My anger and anxiety were quelled and I felt much more confident. I'm so disappointed that I had to titrate down to 200 mg.It takes some of the edge off, but I can tell the difference.I have very few of the above-mentioned side effects, now, though.
I will be talking to my prescriber to determine if she has an idea of something I could take along with Lamictal to mimic the same effects.Maybe I'll just have to go back up to the 400 mg dose and deal with the side effects. I suppose it's a trade off, either way."

726$Bipolar Depression$4/13/2011 1:49:53 PM$Reviewer: Drum and Bass, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I was first diagnosed with depression which turned out to be very wrong as things got so bad with taking an anti-depressant that I start getting sucidal thoughts and was crying all the time.  Finally, I did my own research and went and saw a mental health doctor that was able to diagnose Bi-polar disorder extremely fast.  Lamictal was the first and only drug I have ever tried for bi-polar and it makes such a difference that I was shocked.  I can't beleive how many years I went thinking my moods were normal.  No more mania where my thoughts race and no more crying either.  I noticed 12 hours or so after taking the pill it must wear off or something becaue my thoughts become fuzzy again.  I now take the pill first thing upon rising and it works fine.  No other side effects really, but if I forget to take the pill for even one day, I do feel a difference.  If you are truly bipolar then give it a shot.  My doctor informs me it's one of the best drugs for bipolar patients as it has very few side effects.  I have been on the drug for a couple years and can't beleive how much better things are.

It was prescribed to me when I became very suicidal during a low in the cycle of the bipolar. Lamictal saved my life and I would recommend it to anyone. It has kept me level for the time that I have been on it. I have had a few side effects. I am currently trying to taper off to see how I will do on a very low dose from 400mg hopefully to 150mg. I am very athletic and the med has significantly limited my stamina. Hopefully I won't relapse too badly. I will say that I owe my  life to lamictal so if you need a good med and have not tried lamictal, definitely ask your physician about it. Good luck!

I did as the doctor prescribed and I started to experience really bad side effects. First my entire inner thighs had hives and itched like crazy. However that wasn't the worst part. For a full week when I went up to 75mg, I would wake up at 5am with my back hurting and felt like I was going to have a heart attack. It got to the point that I was in so much pain that I could barely get out of bed. This wouldn't go away until 12pm when the pill wore off. At that moment, I decided to get off the meds at once. Sure it helped maintain a better affect, but I almost died from the horrible side effects!

I have decluttered my whole house effortlessly, organized things that I never seemed to be able to do.I did try I managed to get all A's in a sw master's program 20 years ago i wanted to help others and understand myself.It was exhausting. Infact everything I ever achieved was never as far as I dreamed and took a lot out of me to function.Now I hope this lasts because Everyday that goes by and i am able to keep going forward with organizing dealing with life calmly and most importantly enjoy spending time with my son.  I would be out of it and have to go to bed or so caught up in something that i was there but not really.I am able to move forward with friends, events, tasks and routines. I believe drinking smoking not get enough sleep, hormonally unbalanced (I was) stress and not having a healthy life style w food and exercise,lower the chances of having great success with any drug. after 2 months on this drug, i had a glass of wine I haven't had any alcohol in months I had a migraine body aches foggy brain.  I got over it . Some people say that coffee alcohol cashews and chocolate need to be cut out.The chocolate gets in once in a while, coffee too but i mostly drink decaf,  I am going forward and not looking back at what I created because of promises broken no shows, paranoia and just not functioning  so many dreams crushed friends lost. I value my mental functioning more than anything and love this new found freedom and ease in my ability to be in the world  I have just performed my music.  Passionate lyrics and music i have written over the years i can do it now. I hope to keep new friends and hopefully my family will gain respect and understanding when they see me functioning consistently at such a higher level.I wish all of you the same.Would like to know your stories. May I always feel this way.

I tend to find, from myself and others, that these psychological drugs just change the problem. Instead of being depressed you have headaches, blurred vision and mental confusion. Now this is not to say that the switch is bad, it's often better, but it's certainly not optimal. Once you accept this you might feel better about your situation. I have found that the headaches and lack of mental clarity are the worst for me. I'm a grad student so this is certainly not the best fit for me. But as I said earlier, it's better than being depressed and not having the desire to use my mental functions at all. I think that this drugs work best when you are under the careful watch of a doctor who really take the time to have a close relationship with you. Any kind of medication like this could be a short-term solution, a few years maybe. It's a means to an end. The end in this case is dealing with depression, mood swings and anxiety. To many doctors seem to think the medication is the end solution. I really look forward to the day I no longer have to take lamictal or any alternative. As long as you have that goal in mind, you express that clearly to your doctor and he's willing to help you reach that goal, the drug can help in the meantime. You just have to willing to accept the side effects, which as I said, while no fun in their own right, are often preferable to the alternative.

It took quite some time for me to have enough in my system but after I did, I began to fall down unexpectedly.  I was hurt twice.  I made a suicidal attempt that left terrible scars.  Finally, my thyroid enlarged to the point I looked like a man.  NONE of my doctors could say why but after a sonogram and trips to the GP,OB GYN and then ENT, I had a refill come due and reread the info.  Lo and behold my symptoms stared out at me.  All stopped after getting off Lamictal.  One year later, though I have hypothyroidism and can't help but wonder (with no other risk factors) if this drug didn't ultimately cause  this condition, too.

Lamictal was a godsend and I am on 350 mg.  I have only been off it for the first 2 trimesters of my pregnancy and got back on the last trimester.  I nursed on it and my son is fine (very intelligent).  I am not always happy (I am also on a low does of celexa) but I am a lot more balanced and only really offkilter before my period.  My one problem with Lamictal is that it has really messed up my memory.  I am 37 and feel like I have dementia sometimes.  It can be embarrasing when you are having a conversation with someone and you can't even recall the details of what you talked about with them about just a few days before.  But my psychiatrist says that if you get off it, the memories come back and I feel it is worth the loss of memory to feel basically normal.  My husband also finds me much more pleasant since I have been on it!

The depression is going away slowly, I still have ups and downs. I am noticing a slight change in my weight but that's for the better. I also have noticed a small rash but just saw it right before I looked it up on here and plan to call my doctor tomorrow about it. (Sadly for me, all the meds that work are ones that make me super sick. Wish it was different!) I was on lithium off and on until recently when they finally changed my meds after 8 years. I was up to 1200mgs a day of lithium and they were going to change it again and up the dosage. That's where I run into problems with my thyroid and kidneys so I opted for a new med. This one has a chance of weight loss and I'm already too heavy so I picked this one. 

Hopefully the rash isn't anything major, I WAS just pregnant, miscarried. Could just be hormones yet. "

I think I have no choice other than back off again to the 300 mg and will consult with my Dr. about this. i can otherwise swear my the Lamictal and believe it has changed my life with its mood-stabilizing abilities. I'm afraid to try anything else as I am in a comfort zone with this med, except for the recent side effects. --A final note: I was also using Abilify as an anti-psychotic but after six months developed tardive dyskinesia, where my tongue began squirming and writhing like it had snakes in it! very bizarre!

THE NAME BRAND, the generic is a different drug all together and dangerous.I developed depression when I was 35 due to a situation beyond my control.I was always a happy person.It got bad.After a few years,I tried antidepressants,made me angry.I went to a psychologist for talk therapy.She said that possibly I was bipolar.I was a workaholic.She recognized it as a mild manic episode,combined with the depression.She suggested I also go see a psychiatrist she knew.I went and the DR. suggested I try a new drug on the market. She was very familiar with it.She had done long studies in her internship for her Doctorate for FDA approval and it was a very promising drug for bipolar.She said she had done other studies and this drug was very successful in controlling bipolar depression.She even said it was the first drug to make such an impact on Bipolar.I was informed of the side effects, especially the rash.I researched it then went back to try it.I made an appointment in 1 month and was told to call at anytime I didn't feel quite right,any side effects,no matter how small.I was told how to slowly work up to a clinical dose 25 mg at a time, increasing weekly.I went back after 3 weeks, the terrible depression and hopelessness went away slowly IN 3 WEEKS! It brought the depression down to a manageable level,changed my life for the better.She even was surprised how fast it worked for me.I don't like meds so I slowly worked up to 175mg.My DR said a clinical dose was at least 200 and usually more. I kept that same dose for a few years until finally I increased it slowly, when I felt the depression coming on. I now take 300mg in the morning after 8years.I've had no side effects unless I forget,shakiness,it reminds me to take it. It scares me to think if I ever can't get it,I'm in trouble.I had severe reactions when I tried 3 generics,double vision,loss of ALL motor control,unable to move a muscle 7 hours 911.The generic is very dangerous.

Still have my lows and highs, but they are fewer and further between now. My hesitation with this drug was the length of time it took to get me to the right dosage. I now run a risk (albeit low) of developing seizures should I miss more than 2 doses in a row and would have to start all over again. I can definitely tell a difference if I miss a dose or am late taking one.

Ive been taking lamictal for a couple years now and i love it, i feel a calm within me, even my kids have noticed a difference, i do not know where i would be today if i was not taking lamictal because my life was a rollercoaster going nowhere i kept job hopping could not stay committed in a relationship and on top of the bipolar i have adhd which i take medication for so between the two i was a very wreckless person, i tried regular depression meds but that made my moods worse so i was not sure about taking this med but i'm very grateful for it, it has kept me living a straight and narrow life im able to be and stay in a wonderful relationship. I'm over the days of not being able to stand myself when i was in my miserable angry moods. I do have alot more manic days but i like that cuz it keeps me busy and i get alot done. I have my moods and adhd under control so now i have to work on my stressing about everything all the time,but do not want to take meds for that. I recommend lamictal to anyone that can not take regular depression meds for the bipolar.

I started taking this drug about 6 weeks ago.  The Doc. started me out at 25 mg, then a week later to 50, because the drug was ineffective, she moved me up to 100 mg.  This was HORRIBLE!  I had feeling of intense anger/rage.  I was mad at my family, friends, me............the whole world.  I was really Bitchy!  I also had periods of weepiness.  I lowered my dose to 75 mg and within 72hrs I was back to my normal self.  I have had positive things happen for me.  I feel that I am more focused ie. balancing my cheekbook, on time for work, house clean and cooking more.  I have only been on the 75mg dose for a short time, I hope that I keep feeling more focused and stable, if not I will have to discontinue the drug.  I am not going to experiment with different dossages due to the severe side effects.  I truly hope that by sharing this info I help someone who may be experiencing these weird side effects, these emotions are not listed as possible side effects of this drug, or at leaset none that I have seen."

Lamictal was included with the cymbalta and now I feel so  much better! Plus my weight has gone back down. I do notice an increased desire for sweets though. Then when having to switch to the generic Lamogrin because of the expense, I've had to increase my dosage for the same affect. My doctor says that is a common problem for people on the generic brand.

I didn't feel ANYTHING at all until I got up to 150mg. It was then that I started feeling the fatigue, strange muscle aches and backpain, lack of interest, lack of the ability to concentrate, strange trembles. My doctor initially suggested I take the medication in the morning because it can cause Insomnia. After two weeks on 150 mg I was instructed to go up to 200 mg. The fatigue became so severe that I would literally count down the hours and minutes until I could leave work, come home and just go to bed. I couldn't handle this so recently I decided to take it in the middle of the afternoon and it has done WONDERS for me. While I'm still getting the benefits of this medication, I don't have to deal with the fatigue or other side effects during the day. I would suggest that people try and be as patient as possible with Lamictal and attempt to find a way to take it that works for you.

Firstly because I'm a bit medication-phobic and secondly because I had a bad time with both Depakote and Gabapentin. However, I needn't have worried because Lamictal was so much easier for me to tolerate. I had no bad side effects with it at all, very slight sleepiness for the first couple of days and each time I upped the dose, but other than that nothing. Despite the annoying amount of time it takes to titrate to a helpful dose, it is definitely worth doing it sensibly to lower the chances of the dreaded rash. I started on 25mg a day and week by week increased by 25mg until I reached the 200mg a day that I take now. I have found 200 to be effective for me and am sticking with that for the time being. I know there is still further room to increase if I need it. I have only been on Lamictal since January, so 8 months now, but in that time my moods have been much more stable. I still have slight lows and slight highs but instead of my moods flying uncontrollably between -10 to +10 now it's more like -4 to +4 - I never quite seem to get any higher than slight hypomania nor any lower than slight depressions. For me this drug has helped massively.

I have had no problems for about 3 years but was somewhat depressed lately so doctor uped the dose.  I came to see if a higher does might be a problem.  Hard to tell as there are lots that its working and some that it is not.  I am used to all of this as I have been on meds for 20 years now.  My only problem with all of these meds is that I have gained weight and am having a hard time losing weight.  I don't really blame it on the meds though.  As long as I am feeling well emotionally I will deal with the weight.

He has been bipolar for the 33 years I have known him.  The doctor seems to think that the bipolar disorder is a bigger problem than the alzheimer's.  He is an alcoholic as well.  He has had to grown sons commit suicide.  Four other grown children , I suspect have some type of disorder as well.  Their mother is an alcoholic.  I am thankful that he and I never had children together.  He lives in an independent living facility for the past three years as my traveling job prevents me from taking care of him, he cannot be left alone.  They are having complaints about him now.  He steals small things when they take him shopping.  His comments always border on sexual and his behavior in general is very inappropriate, even in front of total strangers.  I don't know what I will do with him next.  I feel they are getting weary of him there.  I have no help financially or otherwise from his remaining 4 grown children.  He is taking Lamotrigine, Aricept and Fluoxitine for his depression.  Please, any suggestions would be appreciated.  I am at a financial loss and am having such a hard time emotionally with this as well. He is 77 years of age.

Overall, I agree with what a few others had said that at the higher dosage I feel more hostile, agitated and impatient, so I definitely recall at the lower dosages being less angry and hostile, so either I will try again at the lower dosage or I will need to come off this medication altogether cause I will not continue to itch like this all day every day.

But I would like to tell you HOW. I have been suffering with bipolar 2 for 6 years now. I literally thought I had become a crazy, worthless person. I couldn't remember conversations with co-workers and I think I was about to lose my job. My boss told me to see a psychiatrist. He is a good guy...I think that was going to be the last attempt for him to help me before firing me. I used to be a highly functioning person. I managed to graduate from college with a 3.2 GPA without going to class even 50% of the time. I loved physical activity and reading and music. 6 years ago everything changed. I was in a grad program and failed out. I was going to class and studying constantly but I was having major memory problems. Then I started having depression, then hypomanic episodes. I was just a complete mess. My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal slowly while slowly weaning me off of Lexapro. Now I am at 400mg daily and I feel wonderful. I am back to being a highly active, functioning person. I am me for the first time in 6 years. My husband is delighted--he only knew me AFTER the bipolar set in. He has loved me through all of this, but now he is just amazed at what a better person I have become. Still me, obviously, but without all of the drama. :-) Not every drug is right for everyone. Lamictal was just the one that was right for me. I am a success story. I am so happy to have my life back.

It has been wonderful  --  decreased impulsivity,  much smoother interaction with others.  For the past  4  months,  however,  my short-term memory has significantly decreased to the point where it is negatively affecting daily functioning.  My thinking is cloudy and I find myself withdrawing from interacting with others because of the feeling of  ""weakness""  in my cognition.  Is taking Lamictal worth it?

I have a profound ringing in my ears (tinnitus) that began about a month into my usage. However, after trying 6 other drugs, this is the only one that seems to control both my depressive episodes as well as infrequent manic behavior.  All said, family and friends notice a remarkable positive change, but i still have considerable anxiety over the tinnitus, as well as being overwhelmed by repetitive noises and loud talking.  Using this medication has been overall positive, but if I had known about the profound distraction of the ringing, I would have continued my search for another drug.

I was diagnosed bipolar in 1991 with possible ad/hd, which was confirmed by a long test administered by an expert in the field. From 2001 on, having lost insurance with a divorce, I was forced to seek treatment at the VA! Not good!!! Having been treated by 6 doctors there, the only were treating the depression aspect of my disorder. I was unaware of this as most of these doctors were impatient and few could speak adequate English. Finally, I was declared disabled by SS and received my Medicare card July 1 of 09. I purchased an Advantage Plan from a private health insurance company to allow me great access to health care. $ months ago, I had my first session with a highly recommended private psychiatrist. I presented my medications for review. In less than 3 minutes, he declared: ""You're not on any mood stabilizer."" Imagine my surprise and displeasure. All those years, the flip-flopping of moods, all the different combination of medications, all the family, spousal dysfunction, with divorces and separations, all the hope that the next mediation would do it and last! The new doctor prescribed this drug. Literally, within a week, and only on the trial pack, I was a new man! I hadn't felt this good in years. Everything changed. I'm also taking Cymbalta for depression but at much lower dose. Gradually, he increased my dose of Lamictal,to 200mg. And though, my current wife is living somewhere in Indiana, and there since right after her accompanying me to the new doctor, I'm naturally feeling depression as there no contact with her and I love and care for her deeply and I believe she me, I'm managing to take care of things I could not manage before. I'm opening mail, paying bills, taking showers, doing some writing, more of less living a more 'normal' life. This medication has turned my life around! I pray that these results continue. I can't praise this drug more highly. After 4-5 months, still doing fine, in spite of living alone and missing my wife. A new me!!!!"

I am on the Lamictal at 300mg as a maintenance med in-between my shock treatments.  It seems to have improved my mood balance. I have some co-morbid conditions such as ADHD, GAD, which I take other meds for.

Before I used to stay in bed all day and took absolutely no pleasure in doing anything. But no I have got my mojo back and am starting to become more active. Still have some trouble sleeping and am taking Seroquel to help sleep and also to boost the effect of the Lamictal, it's not as good as Benzos but at least it is not addictive.  Currently taking 75mg of Lamictal and am gradually increasing to 200mg. Only side effects I have noticed are a slight unsteadiness when getting up and some insomnia. I have a soft bipolar II with only moderate hypo-manic episodes, still enough to make me do stupid stuff. Hope others find Lamictal as effective at treating bipolar depression as I have.
One more thing, does the ease of use rating seem a bit redundant, as the vast majority of medications are taken orally it is not exactly difficult to swallow a pill. Just a thought."

I've been taking it about 1-1/2 yrs and it definitely helps level my moods, it's not a cure-all I still have my ups and downs, but the swings are much less sereve and the are manageable (in fact the hypo-manic feeling I get is actually nice compared to the hyper-manic shooping sprees followed by crash and burn).
As noted this may not work for everyone, and it does take a while to start feeling the full effects, 3-6 months was my experience.
As far as side effects, I am on 300mg and I though maybe I was still a little to manic, so I was increased to 400mg and started having irratability and anger problems (which is a little known potential side affect), going back to 300mg solved that.
Just wondering though about the long term use of the product, in my experience some things would work for a while and then ""turn"" on me (Lithium for one) or stop being effective.  I'm wondering about memory issues specifically, short term, cloudy (foggy)thinking, etc."

I was diagnosed with depression and after trying several meds that caused bad side effects, Lamictal has been great. It took 6 weeks for the initial side effects such as itching, water retention, flush cheeks, etc. to go away, but after this period, the Lamictal kicked in and totally lifted the depression. at 150 mg,I am very happy with it.
I have noticed a slight rash which looks pimples when upping the dose. It goes away in a few days with Cortizon cream and Benadryl. I have also noticed that I am more hungry than before but I have not gained weight. I did lose 30 lbs I gained on Zyprexa. As far a rash goes, everyone is so stressed about the SJS rash, but not all rashes that occure are serious. It is sad that so many people see a small rash and panic, going off the med. I received a terrible rash with Lyrica and still have the scars from that. All of these meds can cause rashes. Its best to let your doctor check it out but chances are that 99% of rashes are okay and will go away."

Yes, we know it isn't ""approved"" for use in children, but he is in the care of a top notch child psychiatrist and his response to the medication has been remarkable.

A bit of history:  My son has had an ADHD dx for over a year, but clearly something else is going on, resulting in enormous rages and persistent irritability.  Also hugely swinging moods throughout the day that were unpredictable.  He was expelled from kindergarten after a particularly awful outburst at school in which he hurt another student and his teacher.  We made the excruciating decision to hospitalize him for safety reasons and try to get to the bottom of things.

After starting Lamictal, in addition to the risperdal and focalin he was already taking, his moods are smooth and emotion is appropriate to the situation.  No more rages and he's able, with help, to talk about what he feels and find solutions.  He started a new school and is doing very well socially and academically.  He's affectionate again, which is a big plus for mom and dad. :-)  Basically, now we have a 6 year old who fits in with the other 6 year olds and feels good about himself.     

NO negative side effects to this point.  Currently on 25 mg after building up slowly from 10.

We know things can get rocky again in the future, as he grows and his body chemistry changes, but for now we're VERY SATISFIED and hopeful.        "

Stopped the medication immediately, but rash continued to progress.  Went to dermatologist, got a shot of prednisone to counteract the allergic reaction, but rash continues and derm. dr. said it would probably be with me for a couple of weeks.  Very uncomfortable, obviously this medicine is not for me.  Very similar to poison ivy reaction.

I started taking Cymbalta at the same time, which I think has resulted in most of the improvement, but Lamictal is definitely doing something right. I have never experienced ANY side effects from Lamictal. I take 300 mg a day; 100 mg in the morning and 200 mg at night. I have not been significantly depressed or manic since I started taking this drug, which is the longest break since my diagnosis 5 years ago. My doctor started me at 25 mg for 5 days, then 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and finally to 300 mg, with each increase 5 days apart. I think anyone who has tried a lot of medications with no success should definitely consider giving Lamictal a try.

I've been on it for 14 months and I noticed hair loss almost immediately. I can handle the hair loss to a certain extent, but I will consider other options if it gets to be too much. My short term memory is a lot worse than it was before beginning Lamictal. I've addressed the issue with my doc and she said that it is a symptom of bipolar, not a side effect of the drug. I don't agree necessarily. I've always had memory issues, but I noticed a drastic decline when I started the drug. Again, if it gets too much worse I'll consider an alternate treatment. Besides those two very frustrating side effects I've been very pleased with my moods. I take 300 mg and 300 mg Wellbutrin and the combo is working well so far. I also have ringing of the ears due to the Wellbutrin, but that's a story for another day LOL.

It took a while to find the medications that worked for me.  Don't be worried about taking more than one drug either.  I have been taking Lamictal for 3 1/2 YEARS.  I am taking 400 mg and have been for most of that time period.  I have had excellent results on this med, and have had no side effects at all, ever, nor have I had any significant weight gain.  This medicine has worked wonderful for ME.  It has stabilized my mood dramatically.  I also take Wellbutrin 450 mg, and Seroquel 100 mg.  This is the ""cocktail"" of meds that have worked for me.  As I said, I have been on this combo of drugs for 3 1/2 years.  Medicine affects everyone differently.  Don't think that just because one person had serious side effects that you will also.  This medicine may be just what you need.  Sometimes you have to trust the doctor more than the reviewers.  The doctors know what the side effects may be.  They are in no way trying to hurt you!  They trying to help you the only way they know how!  Good luck and God bless you!  There is hope, just don't give up!"

This is incorrect, every oen and everybody is different. I started on 25 mg and increased very slowly and STILL got stevens johnson syndrome. i.e. this ""rash"" that they talk about. So that information is misleading. and about the scary info you ""need not see"", exactly the contrary. This is the information I wish i WOULD have known about before i took Lamictal and it changed my life forever, and definitely not for the better. Am in contant pain now after SJS almost claimed my life. Yes, you should all ask your doctor's questions, many questions. But the scary pictures are the truth and what people do need to see. My doctor told me starting out slow and on the 25mg for 1st week, 50 for second and 75mg for 3rd, it could possibly DECREASE the chance, NOT completely eliminate it. Everryone please be careful. Any signs of a ""rash"" puffy swollen eyes or fever headache..ANYTHING like this..please tell your dr. Asap . if you do get the reaction..it may not stop on it's own there is a chance it may have to run its course and won't stop blistering and burning up your body. It also may not stop it from becoming permanently disabling or disfiguring, which happened to me. God Bless you all.

*This medication is not supposed to be given to children 16 and under, as it can increase the risk of you getting the rash. * Please be careful all."

At times, I think I feel even more helpless and depressed as before taking it. I still have the same periods of wanting to stay in bed, being happy one minute and sad the next, and feeling like I hate my life despite having a good life. I also have gained weight because of lack of interest in going to the gym (which I used to go 4-5 times a week) therefore gaining almost ten pounds in three months. At my next psychiatrist visit, I am going to tell him to take me off this drug and try a new one.

But if you start quite slowlly and go up only by 25 mg per week you'll be fine. Start slow.  That's the key to keeping the rash away.  That's the hard part for me because I often forget how many pills to take so I'll update again when I'm on my top dfose and no rash.  If I get the rash I'll let you know.  Just to be fair.  I'm caucasian and they say asians are more prone to get the rash.  I'm quite hopeful for this medication.  I'm only on week 2, 50mg a day, and I'm feeling a difference.  I hope this will be helpful.  Thank everyone! If you're scared of the reash, ask your doctor lots of questions and don't seek it out online, there is scary info and pictures out there that you need not see. I wish I had never sought online info out.  I'll keep you poste4d on what happens to me!  Thanks! Bye!

Has really helped w/ Bi-polar type II, evening out the symtoms (higs & lows) much more effectively than any other phyc. drug I've taken (dealing w/ bi-polar issues for 15+ yrs.)It took 2 months to show positive results but worth the wait!! I take it in combination w/seroquel 50 mgs.per day for sleep.I'm adding lexapro for obsessive negative thoughts that I've been dealing w/ for years - used major trancs.for in the past. One negative side effect was when I first started taking lamictal I actually lost (temporarily) my ability to spell even very simple words. Lamictal does not have any sexual side affects nor does it put you in a stupor like some of the other major players do.

Due to the constant struggle not to gain weight, and not succeeding, I am going off the drug. Most people say this does not cause weight gain but that has not been my experience, although it is difficult to tell how much may also be middle age weight gain. I also experienced night time wakening which added to the weight gain.

I started having migranes, gaining weight and have had absolutley no energy. Now what's worse is this horrible rash. It started out with hives and turned into a rash starting from my arms down my trunk and both legs. I'm so itchy that I feel like shaving my skin off, no joke!!! I can't sleep or even hold the baby right now because the itch is so intense. I've been off this horrible medication for weeks now and things are getting worse. I have used benedryl, topical anti-itch meds and nothing is working I sure would like to know how long it is going to be like this. I would not recomend this medicine to anyone!!!

For the first time in my life I'm assertive, and actually get agitated at times. (I kinda was like Eeyore- nothing could really make me mad, I was just always sad.) This has been an amazing discovery for me, because I finally feel more normal. My friends and family see it too. I'm finally giving normal responses instead of being passive and hiding under my rock. 

No sexual side effects for me. 

One concern I've heard though- is that I display symptoms of mania a bit. I never ever have. I only ever expressed depressed and really depressed. So it's something I keep an eye on. "

1089$Bipolar Depression$7/8/2009 9:24:53 PM$Reviewer: tryandtryagain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I am bipolar 2 and have ADD. Lamictal worked for me. I even weaned myself off of it after about 2 years. Now 3 yrs later, that pesky bipolar depression is back and effecting my job, so for insurance reasons, I have been taking the generic version,lamotrogine, which is not as effective as lamictal. I have been on lamotrogine for about a year now (50mg). I get a bad headache if I don't take it on time, I feel like it is not working as well as it did at first and i am slowly becoming a space cadet. Dizzy, forgetful, confused, unmotivated. I have been bipolar for so long and tried soooo many different meds. none of them have been the answer, but lamictal worked the best so far...NOT LAMOTROGINE. Side note on the other meds i have tried: Paxil, Prozac and Wellbutrin =zombie. adderall and ritalin= heart palpatations, major anxiety, shaky, difficulty breathing. (ritalin less bothersome than adderall) Trileptil (oxcarbenzapine)= major allergic reaction (swollen itchy red blistery hands and a rash, but steroids was quickly administered. It wasn't as bad as the other person below. (I feel for you.) I advise when taking any new meds, do it in the daytime when your drs office is open and while someone is with you, just in case of an allergic reaction. A Dr. visit is always cheaper than the emergency room. If you are like me, you just want to feel somewhat productive in this life and not so out of it all the time. Bottom line is that everyone is different and YOU are your best advocate, so speak up and do your research if somethings not working.

I started taking Lamictal in 2002.and almost 7 years later I am still suffering the effects Lamictal has left on me. As a result of taking Lamictal,I developed Stevens Johnson Syndrome...this is the ""rash"" the doctor's might tell you about as a side effect. SJS however is far more than that. If you get this so called ""rash"" from Lamictal...it gives you a reaction that litterally makes your skin peel off and blister and cause your skin to have chemical burns from the inside out. This was an extremely awful and painful experience. I was in the burn center for 6 weeks and gave me a ventilator, because the skin on my lungs was sloughing off as a result of the medication and I couldn't breathe on my own. I would give anything to go back and never have taken Lamictal. Maybe for some people, when you have no other option, you might have to use it as a last resort..but for me their were so many other options. You also have to watch out for swollen lymph nodes this could be a sign that you are getting an allergic reaction. The chemical burns from the Lamictal made it so there were blisters in my eyes and now I have unbearable eye pain and eye problems. My eyes do not look normal I have redness pain, dry eye syndrome,(severe,I have to use eyedrops about 10-20 times a day) photophobia,trichiasis,blepharitis,droopy,swollen eyelids, and constant eye infections because of this. I have scars and have also lost all my fingernails and toenails because I lost my nail beds as a direct result of Lamictal. I also am very sensitive to hot and cold temperature and cannot be out for long periods of time.IMPORTANTIf you get SJS..it MIGHT NOT STOP AFTER YOU STOP THE MEDS... IT MAY HAVE TO RUN ITS COURSE!Now,if you are thinking, this happened to just one of those people who are one out of a million, you are wrong The risk is a lot higher than you think. just please be careful and ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME"

At first I had minor nasuea 1st few days that I could deal with that got better but it seemed like each increase I did I had the same thing happening & my tounge and a tingling sensation. On week two I got a smooth red rash that was very itchy and became worried. I was told it wasn't the ""lamictal rash"" *which would be on my trunk and spread"" and was given some cream. I noticed some acne and now I have devoloped another itchy rash this time small red bumps on my legs, back & chest. I went to the Dr today and was told that ""the lamictal rash is a blister rash"" apply a different Rx cream & ""just keep an eye on it."" I have never had a problem with rashes before taking this medicine and I can't help but think that even though not the life threating oozing ""lamictal rash"" it is still being caused by this medicine."

I started out about 2 years ago at 100mg and since have doubled to 200mg. i am also on Cymbalta and Trazedone for sleep. I'm developing a serious sugar overeating habit.I have also gained weightsince I started on the Lamictal and have not been able to lose it even though I go to the gym 3-4 days a week. I'm not sure the drug is doing any good anymore due to little change in my mood swings and thoughts of suicide though these thoughts come and go quickly. Overall, I think Lamictal was good for me for awhile, but I'm thinking it has started to lose its effectiveness. My doctor says that 200 mg is the highest I can go on it and that's what I'm taking. so I'm a little frustrated.

I was on Seroquel and Zyprexa for years, and although I felt well with those two, I just kept gaining so much weight, going from 190 lbs to 270 lbs in five years.

My bi-polar symptoms started to come back albeit in a manageable way.

It seems that for my doctor he saw this as a good ""excuse"" to put me on Lamictil.  He could not have made a better decision.

It took some time and dosage adjustments and in addition balance this with treating my other issues.

However, I started to lose my weight, and at the same time, my moods have been stable for nearly two years.

Like any other drug, it won't work for everyone, but with my experience with losing my weight and having my moods stabilized this is worth a consideration by you and and your doctor.

The knock down in ease of use is that I need to take two 150 mg for 300 mg.  It may never happen but I would like to see a single 300 mg."

This kid had been sleeping an average of 18 hours a day for the last 4 months (had to drop regular school) so you can imagine my joy as her mom.

I kinda liked having the hypomania part of the disorder at least then people liked to be around me.

Im sick of explaining myself. I was diagnoised 2months ago and still havent gotten better I cry all the time and Im very angry and I fight with my partner all day every day. I hate how I feel why does it take so long why don't the doctors really listen Im sorry but they are a joke. I don't even know if I agree with them about being bipolar everyone else that knows me and that I have worked with for 7yrs feel im not and just think Im ADHD which that is what I agree with. But no damn doctors won't listen Im really about to bug on them and tell them about themselves Im the one paying them and for what to feel like crap everyday what a joke. I just want to be happy and function and be the best that I can be as a mother, counselor and wife. This medication has sucked the joy out of me which prior to had none anyways but somehow I do feel worse, and this rash thing scares the crap out of me.

1190$Bipolar Depression$3/1/2009 9:57:05 AM$Reviewer: Me, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was diagnosed Bipolar- II almost two years ago.Lamictal and Zoloft were the first drugs that were prescribed for me. I never felt right on the Zoloft or any SSRI or SNRI for that matter. I got up to the 300mg doses of lamictal and felt it had stopped being as effective as it was in the beginning. This took 1/2 year to poop out. I then started looking for alternatives as my Doc. at the time just wanted me to slowly increase lamictal, yet I felt I needed another med. Well, I went back to my first Doc. that diagnosed me, and tried different meds., but after reading a book called Bi-polar II, from the library I found that the gold standard, for Bi-polar is Lithium Carbonate ER. So I suggested this to my doc. and I have been taking it along with 150mg Lamictal for less than a week. I tell you, I have felt some calmness, and peace with the Lithium add-on already and look forward to more. She only started me at 300mg twice a day. We will do bloodwork soon to see if I need an increase for the theraputic level. I just wanted to pass this along to others, as lithium was the first med. available to treat bipolar and sometimes docs. go with the newer meds. that the drug companies produce. It may have side effects, check them out with your doc. So far though I have been excercising 30min. a day and cutting out gluten and sugars, eating more good carbs. and protein, no weight gain yet. I tell you the side effects may be so minimal for me that I don't feel anything but benefit for Lithium so far. I'll keep you posted.
I am in therapy every two weeks,working part-time, and have a great marriage with two great teenage girls. It isn't easy to make it trough each day, sometimes I force myself to sit back and be thankful for what I do have and have managed to keep up with considering my mental health and lack of sleep, (getting better). Thank you for all of your messages on Web MD, I have read many."

I began at 25 mg and have since moved up to 100 mg daily, a dose that I have been on for just over a month now.  I also take 150 mg Wellbutrin daily.  This combination seems to be working for me.  This is the first medication I have ever taken that has not given me side effects and that in itself makes a wonder drug for me!!  Taking this medication in conjunction with cognitive therapy is now a lifestyle for me and has improved my quality of life dramatically.  I experienced slight weight gain after the first month, but have since been able to maintain my weight through diet and exercise, something i was unable to do while on prozac (which caused horrible weight gain for me).  Both the generic and brand name lamictal are expensive.  if you do not have prescription insurance, go to www.bridgestoaccess.com and see if you qualify for GSK's help.  I qualified and now receive the brand name for free.  This program also includes many other GSK drugs so it is well worth looking into. (I receive my wellbutrin for free as well).  I wish others much success in their endeavour to maintain their bipolar disorder as well.

When I got to the 100mg, I started to notice a difference, and now that I'm on the 150mg, I really notice the side effects. 
Plus, NOTE THIS, I was told I could take Benadryl for the itching and/or simple rash. So I was having one of my many sinus attacks, so I looked through my medicine cabinet and took Benadryl Severe Sinus and Allergy....don't do that!  About an hour after I took it, I started to have nausea, chills and shaking, and a burning feeling in my chest and throat.  I finally passed out, due to what I still don't know.  When I woke up I very shakily drove the mile to my family drs office, and they gave me fluids, but weren't sure what was happening. I was still shaky, so I stopped at my pharmacy on my way home, and talked to the pharmacist. Right away, he informed me that I couldn't take any kind of decongestant with this medicine.  It will cause the same symptoms I went through (which, btw, leaves you with verrry little options.)  When I informed my psych doctor what I had gone through, she looked it up in her medical journal, and NO where did it say that you couldn't take a decongestant, so she was clueless.  I checked with another pharmacy and they automatically said the same as the other.  So I have learned, always talk to your pharmacist first - they are more knowledgeable about the interactions of drugs than anyone!"

Another downfall is that it is expensice, but fortunately last summer the generic became available.

I took Prozac for 5 yrs and it stopped working for me. My mood swings can be very ruff sometimes. I still have them but not as bad. I can really see a difference in my personality since I have been on Lamictal. I'm more calm but not sluggish. I do have a concern: Has anyone had any severe abdomen pain that comes ever 2 to 3 months? It's almost like bad cramps but you can't move. I'm not sure that this is related to Lamictal or not. Otherwise, I really love the medicine and have no side effects unless the abdomen pains are. If anyone has had similar symptoms please let me know.

I never felt like it was helping even when I was on Lamictal before the insurance swapped me to the generic. When that happened, I had a spiraling affect into a deeper, darker depression. They doc increased me gradually to 2 pills a nite...when that was full-force in my regimen...I began having problems with my right leg and my lower abdomen (of course that supposedly has NOTHING to do with anything, even tho that was the ONLY thing changed) and my anger and depression increased so drastically that I took myself off the crap! I still have problems with my leg and my abdominal problems are still there, but I've only been off the stuff for 2 weeks. I'm not off ALL my meds, just the 2 I hated...I've kept up with my Lithium and MENTALLY feel 75% better than I did when on the other 2...but of course, there is still a lot of stuff outta whack, just need to try and find a different med for the depression and anger bull.

I'm on Lamictal 150-200mg a day. It varies due to the fact that at 200mg I get horrible migraines. At that point my ARNP will lower my dose to 150mg for a short time and then when I feel ready to live witht the headaches again we bump it back up. This usually only takes me a week or two of being at the lower dose before I want to be bumped back up. Two Hundred mg seems to be just where I need to be at to stabilize me. This to me is a WONDER DRUG. I was suicidal when I started on it. I started on the 5 wk starter pack and by the 3 wk I was feeling sooooooooo much better! I've done nothing but get better each day. I highly recommend it. I've always had a high sex drive but on Lamictal it's even higher, which my husband isn't complaining about! :-) The weight gain that I'm currently expiriencing does bother me and it's extremely hard to try and lose the weight once it's put on. I did try for 3 days to add Topamax w/Lamictal. Bad idea for me. Topamax made me fuzzy and unable to function. With Lamictal, I know now what it's like to be a ""normal"" person, the mood swings are still there but aren't severe anymore. I still have bouts of depression but not like before where I couldn't function at all. I'm now on the generic version and at this time haven't expirienced any adverse effects from switching to it."

I may not have the severity of hallucinations and hyperactivity.  I suffer from the depression way more than mania, I have gone three to four days in bed only to get up to eat and pee.  I started taking lamictal 4 years ago, but since I was self-medicating with illegals, it didn't have an affect.  When I cleaned up, 2 1/2 years ago, I tried again.  It's been a long process, when I wasn't in bed for days before, I never slept.  Still don't, I'm a teeth grinder, vivid dreamer.  But the Lamictal has helped me so much in other ways.  I went from being lost in the woods, never holding a job, I'm 28 and celebrating my first one year anniversary at an employer EVER! to finally feeling good and looking forward to life.  I'm at 400mg a day, supposed to be at night and morning but I have no memory so I take them in the morning.  I'm in college, married to a great man, who excepts me the way I am, and a beautiful daughter.  I still have my moments, when things go wrong, stress, missing work, schoolwork difficulties, but the difference I see in my life is amazing.  I've been put on other drugs in combination that have not worked.  Geodon is terrible!  Respidol, I lactated, look it up, it's a side effect.  And a few others.  I've decided to stick to Lamictal and just deal as long as I can.  I don't go to psych anymore, I was not getting any satisfaction out of my doctors.  We can do this ourselves!!  I would recommend to anyone that they discuss taking Lamictal with their healthcare provider.  And stay away from Geodon, I couldn't even drive on the stuff.

I'd be fine and feel normal for months, sometimes a year at a time an then I'd be horribly anxious for months at a time. My primary cares always tried SSRI's which ALWAYS made me vomit and sent me to the ER. I was nervous about taking this medication but desperate because recently it had gotten to the point of me feeling so disconnected from everything that I was scratching myself just to feel something. I started Lamictal on the smallest starter kit the doctor had. I'm just going into week 5. The only thing I've had a problem with is anxiety. It's not worse but it's still there. But I'll take anxiety that I'm used to over overwhelming depression any day. I have an appointment today with the psychiatrist so maybe she will give me something for anxiety that works. Also, one weird side effect I noticed was this kinda ringing in my ears. It's not really like tinnitus (which I get sometimes)but it's more like when it's so quiet in a room that the quiet is deafening. Not sure if that makes sense but that's how I experience it. It's not a huge problem though. I've also notice a moderate increase in sex drive, which I'm not complaining about.

I'm on 200mg in the mornig, and 200mg in the evening. It took me a really long time to get to that dose, but it is amazing for me. I'm extremely bipolar. My therapist said I was the worst case she had ever seen, and she has been a therapist for 17 years.  I'm bipolar # 2. MAYJOR DEPRESSION. I was almost hospitalized for being so depressed. Now since being on Lamictal, I ACTUALLY FEEL NORMAL! I have never been normal in my life! NEVER! It's like I'm a child, and learning how to have health emotions! I thank God for this drug! I hope it works for you!

1388$Bipolar Depression$6/30/2008 5:59:56 PM$Reviewer: $5$5$5$Though the 'final dosage' takes a little while to get to, the results are worth the wait. Even as I got to the 50 mg tabs I started to feel a little better. As the dosage increased, the better I felt. I reached my current dosage five months ago and I have never been happier. I still have some depression from time to time, but it is mild and usually goes away within a few hours. The longest depression period of depression I have had while on Lamictal has been about 2-3 days. I experienced no side-effects whatsoever.

1393$Bipolar Depression$6/26/2008 5:18:48 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I began taking Lamictal 3 years ago for Bipolar dissorder. It has been the only medication, and there have been many, that I can honestly say has made a possitive difference concistantly. Although at times I need another medication as well, Lamictal has given me my life back. It has helped me see the difference between my Bipolar moodswings and authentic feelings. One thing I love about Lamictal is that I NEVER had ANY side effects while taking this medication. My Dr. was genius in putting me on it 3 years ago. Thanx :)
1394$Bipolar Depression$6/25/2008 3:06:23 AM$Reviewer: Just want to be happy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$3$3$5$Doctor prescribed Lamictal while also taking 100mg Zoloft. Had a sudden major depressive episode with uncontrollable crying and thoughts of suicide.  Spent 4 out of 5 days in bed.  Started Lamictal, the 25mg kit, taking one pill every other day for two weeks, then one every day for two weeks, then 50mg a day for a week.  Doctor has now prescribed 100mg Lamictal along with 200mg Zoloft after I finish the sample kit.  Halfway into the third week is when I started to feel a slight improvement in my overwhelming depression at 25mg Lamictal daily.  I went from 100mg to 200mg of Zoloft and didn't feel a change until I took it in combination with Lamictal.  I think the side effects such as the insomnia and profuse sweating I'm experiencing is due to the Zoloft. I start the 100mg dose tomorrow.  I hope to see a considerable difference in my depression.

I am down to one rash on my leg. I am convinced it is from the Lamictal.

They either didnt work, made me worse, or had terrible side effects that I could not tolerate. Lamictal was the only med that made me feel better (for a while) My dose was increased to 400mg which is a very large dose. I was a little better but still very depressed with suicidal thoughts.
I started ECT, and am taking Lamictal as a maintenence medication.  This combination with a mood stabilizer seems to work pretty well.  I still have mixed episodes of mania and depression, but way less often and less severe.  I think Lamictal has less side effects than any of the other meds I have taken, and little to no weight gain. All in all I think it is a good medication for bipolar depression."

It worked good for 8 months then it pooped out. Then i went back because depression  symtoms came back stronger than ever. Then he perscribed effexor xr. While on effexor I lost my job and thought i was loosing my mind i was going crazy. Effexor has dangerious side effects that are terrible for a bi-polar person. I went back. He said that poopout is common with bi-polar people. He wouldnt comment on the effexor side effects. He gave me the bi-polar/seisure drug lamictal. Said it works for both. Been on it for 4 months. Practically no side effects and no more being tired. And feel level headed. Without the manic moods. Even though I liked the up's without the downs. This Lamictal is good stuff. I split my dosage to 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the evening. Works better for me. I give it 5 stars. The depression is 95% gone and the mood swings are 99% gone. Does not help with weight gain. But thats more mind over what you eat. I feel alot better than i have in the last 13 years now. Was a long bumpy road  finding out the right drug. But it works great now.

[email protected]  also, i get confused at times.

Took Lamictal with Prozac.  Initial side-effects: sleepiness, no energy, I could feel my head being different for the first couple of weeks, dosage was eventually at 300mg, and was accompanied by severe migraines that would last for days. Dr. felt that counseling would help. I still have headaches, but less frequent and less severe, definately able to deal with. My issues with bi-polar- impulsiveness, sexual mania, 30# wt. loss, suicidal thoughts, sleeplessness, along with major depression. after maybe 6 months or so, dosage felt right, I felt stable, not feeling so out of control. I HATE taking the meds every day.  I was going to wean off once condition was in ""remission"". The two breakdowns each involved a suidide attempt and I have 6 kids. Not a risk I have decided to take. I have probably had earlier episodes, but was undiagnosed until severe breakdown. Breakdowns were majorly stress induced. Never thought I would go there again after first episode, but I did, approximately 8-9 years apart. I hope medication will keep disease and my health and safety safety. I am not at a therapeutic dose of 150mg with 60mg of Prozac. I have been feeling a little of the old sick self, so I may go back up. Everytime I change dose up or down I have sleep issues. Usually inability to sleep followed by sleeping for long periods. If I miss a dose I notice I have sleep issues, although only for a day or two. It takes alot of patience to get to dose that is right for you and finding the anti-depressant that may also be needed. This is a chemical imbalance...no different than high cholestrol, don't be deterred, not everyone has a respect for mental health. It may be what saves your life and give you a quality of life with your family. If not this med, then maybe another. Work with your Dr."

It took a little while to work, but I finally feel normal again. I used to sleep for 14 or more hours a day, but now can wake up after a normal night of sleep and function. My depression has lessened greatly. I still get the occasional hypo-manic episode, but not that often. I stopped the meds for several months, and my symptoms returned. Now that I have resumed treatment, I feel a ton better. This has reassured me that the medication really has made a difference.

1508$Bipolar Depression$1/6/2008 10:01:04 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has been a life-saver. My biggest problems was impulsive feelings and actions such as aggression towards loved ones and inability to focus on work.  Now i would say that 80% of the time i am able to remain calm and collected(except when premenstrual). My concentration and performance on the job has greatly improved. I've noticed absolutely no negative side effects and wouldn't trade this RX for the world. Even though it is a bit expensive. I've also noticed that if i forget to take the dose one day, i feel no different. But i never miss more than ONE DAY. This coupled with Lexapro is a great cocktail for me.

For the first 3-6 years it worked very well.  After that it stopped working for me.  Currently, I am coming off the medication.  The most obvious withdrawal issue has been debilitating exhaustion.  It was stimulating for me in the years that it worked.  My doctor said the exhaustion/stimulation is not a common effect.  I think the exhaustion will go away the longer that I am away from using Lamictal.

I have been taking Lamictal with other medications- Trazodone for sleep and various antidepressants (which would tend to make me hypomanic).  Without antidepressants I still had depression.

None of the medications helped my bulemia except possibly zoloft."

This is my first medication related to my bipolar disorder though.  It does make me sleep more and I am way more clumsy than usual, but other than that it works wonderfully.  I now notice when I start to over react and/or start to snap at people and can work my way through it without being stubborn (most of the time).  Then again everyone is different...and I haven't talked to my doctor yet, but as far as I'm concerned it is a keeper!

1617$Bipolar Depression$9/29/2007 1:49:41 AM$Reviewer: JEclipse, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I was recently prescribed Lamictal after a serious suicide attempt. It has, I do believe, helped stabilize my moods significantly and I feel like a different person. Side effects have been minimal; the most concerning was memory issues, but Deplin seems to have mitigated that. The only negative things about Lamictal is the need to ramp up slowly to prevent other side effects (rash).

The doc thinks, sometimes, I am slightly bi polar. Lately he says it's ""mixed affective state"" which essentially means they have no idea at all.

I've been on this med for nearly 9 months and as I increase the dose I become more depressed and have constant nausea.

As of today I am stopping this. My partner has been saying to do this for months but I had faith, misplaced. This drug is for epilespsy. If it has any effect on depression it is accidental."

I took it about 2 years when I noticed I started falling from being dizzy and had a foggy brain. My memory was bad and I was starting to have cognitive decline where I went to a neurologist and had an MRI of my brain looking for signs of Parkinsans disease, which was negative. I felt numb and not at all like myself. When I fell on a up escalator at the airport my myself, my psychiatrist took me off of it and now I feel so much better, more like myself and I can think clearly now. The long term effects of anti depressant meds can be dangerous but with bi polar what else could I do. I still take Zoloft and Wellbutrin.  The Lamictol worked for awhile but then it came down to not being good for me.  The benefits didn't outweigh the negative effects.

The first 2 months I took it by itself and it made my mood swing uncontrollable but always depressed.  I would begin to cry for no reason.  My doctor put me back on my Celexa 20mg and I've been fine for about 2 years.  I know it is working because every couple of months I decide to just stop taking all my meds!  Lamictal is not the best drug for someone like me because after 5 days without it you have to start all over with 25mg a day for two weeks, 50mg..... until you get back to your level.  My level is 300mg a day so it takes me 6-7 weeks to recover from my mistake.  I experience mania, which I really enjoy, for a few weeks.

I have had the side effect of grinding my teeth, tightening my jaw and sucking or grinding the sides of my cheeks into my teeth.  As a result, the inside of my mouth is always sore.  When I first started taking it, it negatively impacted my driving.  I wasn't as aware as I should have been and found myself cutting people off, running into curbs and once backed into another car because I didn't notice it.  Fortunately, this has subsided and I am once again a safe driver.  My cycles are better with it, but not gone.  The doctor added Abilify during the last two yeaers and I was doing great.  During the last two weeks I have tried eliminating the Abilify, as it is so expensive.  I have now felt quite depressed, overwhelmed and edgy for about a week.  Definitely going back on the Abilify.  As I have never tried Abilify without the Lamictal, it might just be that the Abilify is what is ""fixing"" me and the Lamictal is doing nothing.  When I am good and stable again with the Abilify, I might try leaving off the Lamictal to see what happens.    "

As a former anoretic, I am worried about drugs for bipolar symptoms that might make me gain weight (many of them list this as a primary side effect).  I have not only not gained any weight, but this drug has helped me achieve a healthy, active lifestyle. 
In other words, this drug works.  I don't take anything else for a diagnosed anxiety disorder and/or possibly bipolar disorder (it runs in my family and I definitely show symptoms).  I would highly recommend this drug because it has few, if any, side effects. 
The only trouble is your doctor will have to start at a low dose because sometimes people have allergic/fatal recations.  So be patient!  While at first you may not notice a difference, if your body tolerates it, your doctor can gradually work up to a therapeutic dose. This drug helps tremendously!"

Once I got off Depakote and started on Lamictal, it was like night and day. It mellowed me out, but not in a zombie-type manner. I haven't had one manic episode since I started it. Generic meds aren't effective for me, so I take the name brand, and no they're not the same. There's a 20% difference between name brand and generic. I've tried smaller doses but found 100mg a day is sufficient. I've tried larger doses, as in 150 and began to experience side effects (same with smaller doses, such as ineffectiveness), where I experience NO side effects at 100mg. I've tried the generic version and had nothing but side effects and  it (as with all generics for me) was totally useless. Each person is different, but I can guarantee this is by far the best out there!

I started out at 200 mg two years ago and have gradually increased over time. 150 to 200, then 300 to 350, and as of one week ago, 400 mg. My doctor had adjusted the dosage to help stabilize my mood swings. I also take Buproprion SR (150 mg) and Clonazepam (.5 mg). I take Adderall (30 mg) for my ADD. Since my recent increase with my Lamictal, in a week I have noticed blurred vision, very red eyes, nausea, and I am quick to anger (I've dealt with the anger issue pretty much since the increase around 300 mg). I dread dissolving the 2 pills in my mouth- you can only stand to dissolve those pills for so long. Lamictal was very helpful in my earlier and lower dosages. I think now some modifications need to be made to the 400 mg. since these side effects began and have now worsened, it's become scary. Lamictal also reduced the effectiveness of my birth control. I became unexpectedly pregnant, resulting in miscarriage b/c of the ""cocktail"" of drugs I take everyday. "

With just starting with the titration of 25 to 50 to 100. The first week I noticed that I still had symptoms of insomnia, suicidal thoughts, rapid thoughts and voices, along with things not really being there. These symptoms became mild that I was about to feel much better than I had been within the past couple years. I was referred to some many doctors and no one knew what was causing these symptoms, until I had a full blow manic attack that I ended up being hospitalized for. This was the first time someone gave me the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, so finally I figured out that someone was indeed wrong with me, not just in my head. I've been taking the 200mg now for about four months now and I can see the difference along with my family. I've been told, ""wow you look like yourself today"" which is something amazing to me. Though I do take other medicines to treat the various aspects of bipolar disorder, but I have found this one to be the most helpful. And I recommend to everyone NEVER stop taking this medicine cold turkey, because you feel like you are going down a dark alley and will have all the side effects come to you at once. "

ECT being my last resort someday. I research before I swallow and as a rule, I try to take as few pills as possible.  So adding Lamictal to my treatment did not make me happy. However, I had reached my medication plateau on Cymbalta and wanted to avoid having to try yet another antidepressant. This medication seems to do just that.  I have been able to keep my dose of Cymbalta at 60mg working smoothly, even if I miss a dose.  It was rough at first. It takes a few weeks for the body to adjust ,even at a 100mg doses, but two months later it was well worth it.  Once it kicks in, going to 200 is no problem.  I do keep an eye on my blood pressure.  I also believe (based on my own research and not fact) that it offers some protection against medication induced seizures. Sounds good to me?

I know a lot of people say that the generic isn't as good as the brand, but to be honest, it's been the other way around for me.  Since I switched to the generic, I've felt better than I have in a very long time.

The only thing I really dislike about the generic is how chalky it is and how difficult is it to break in half.  Since I take 300 mg, I take one and a half tablets and it's very easy to break them unevenly.  A pill divider helps though."

Only had one hospitalization due to MDs not knowing that blurry vision is a side effect. I also take 450 msg of seroquel after zyprexa failed. Also take 300 msg of welbutrin and 1.5 mg of klonopin. This has been my cocktail for years and seems to work well together. I've had to deal with BP for over 40 yrs. Very light sensitive with SAD in winter. This year had a bout of mania from too much sun. Mania is not fun at all. Have had 4 rounds of ECT during my times when the depression was very serious. It's not bad and doesn't hurt. Highly recommend it. Stops depression on the spot. Lamictal when used with other meds can be a real life saver and it keeps the mood swings farther apart. Nothing can ever cure BP so the best thing to do is structure your life around eating,exercising for those with weight gain plus it gets the endorphins firing off which feels good, getting regular sleep no matter what. The brain relies on structured environments when its biochemistry is out of order. Taking good care of yourself and educating the people around you who care for you and enlisting them to help you see the signs of relapse. Meds and cognitive behavioral therapy are the best you can get. DO NOT GO OFF YOUR MEDS. People with BP will always have it - no magic cure - so figure out ways to keep the swings apart. Taking Lamictal is part of what I do before bed...every night.

It's been a miracle for the bipolar issues: at 50 milligrams of Lamictal I went from a volatile, frequently suicidal mess to someone who could function better than most.  However, Lamictal has not done much, if anything, for my epilepsy, even though I'm up to a therapeutic dose.

I started taking Lamictal in May of 2007.  Followed the prescribed ramp-up procedure.  Worked really well starting in 8/07.  Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, started having problems with ""lows"".  Doctor inceased my dosage from 200mg to 400mg per day.  Initially, good results.  I guess because it has happened so slowly,I did not realize that over the past three months, I have gotten extrememly weak, had no coordination, slurred speech and muscle soreness and pain.  The doctor instructed me not to take lamictal for 24 hours and then drop back to 200mg once a day.  The past week has been really tough, but I am beginning to get/feel better.  I was taking 200mg at bed time and then 200mg twelve hours later.  Since dropping back to 200mg, I have been taking my 200mg at 10:00 a.m.  Over the past few days, I am having real problems sleeping and it seemsto be getting worse.  "

BAD IDEA.  my new doctor had me try seraquil - it turned my into a zombie. then abilify - worse idea it caused insomnia the first nite and a full blown manic episode the next day.  i was able to sleep with the help of 20mg of ambien, but am now dealing with coming down and i have increased my lamectal to my original dosage.

I had struggled with taking different medications and was concerned about side effects of anti psychotics that might dull creativity, make me feel foggy or gain weight. On lamotrogine I have experienced none of these side effects whatsoever. It takes a little while to work after titrating up slowly (I started at 25mg and now take 400) but it has honestly been amazing. I no longer have mood swings or depression, my mind is far more rational, my concentration has tripled. I know different medications work for different people but I think lamotrogine is worth giving a go and sticking at it while you titrate up. If it works as it has done for me youâ??ll have no side effects. My quality of life has improved and I hope others can benefit in the same way.

And within a few days of stopping it, the smell was gone.  I know it wasn't female problems b/c I had no other female related symptoms, just the smell. This is very embarrassing to write, even though no one will know who wrote this personally; however the side effect was even more embarrassing. Since it is listed as one of the ""very rare"" side effects, I feel obligated as a woman to share my experience for other women to keep an eye out for in case they develop this.  Female genital disorder has only recently been added as a side effect.  I am the person who never gets the common side effects so I searched for hours before I found only 2 other people with the same report. As for the effectiveness of the medication for treating mood disorders, I found out how effective it had been once I got off of it, so I would have stayed on it had it not been for that one issue."

Generics for this drug recently came out (in about the last yr or so).  The first generic I took, which was diamond-shaped and same color as original, worked exactly the same  However Mylan also makes a generic of the same (my pharmacy just switched to to it), but it is not quick-dissolving.  You should be able to drop a pill in warm water and see most of it disolve in about 90 seconds.   This may not be a problem for some, but it has been for me.  I hope someone finds this helpful.

I don't mean what its for.  I mean for me.  You know how you have favorite medications and others that are on the sidelines.  This is a sideline drug for me.  I don't even know if it works.  See, I experience bad mania (I should mention I'm 40 years old, a male, and have bipolar type 1), not so much depression, though let's not discount it.  While being on Lamictal I was experiencing manic episodes left and right.  It wasn't until I came back to Lithium that my moods were stabilized.  So I am unconvinced of it effectiveness.  But this is just my experience.  I was put on 400mg at first, after tapering up on it to avoid the dangerous rash, and stayed there for years.  Then I began noticing memory problems.  I would have entire conversations and then repeat myself later.  I would forget things.  I became a time traveler, in short.  In consultation with my doctor we decided to cut back.  I went to 200mg and then settled at 100mg, where I am now.  Now I am on hardly any Lamictal and I still don't know what its for.  I hope one of you find out and that it works wonders for you.

I've used additional medications with it over time but they have all lost their effectiveness as is common for bipolar disorder. I've tried reducing or even stopping Lamictal at times but always go back. It truly does stabilize extreme emotions. As for side effects, it's hard to lose weight and above 300mg I have issues with thinking, focusing and sometimes hallucinations or nightmares. That was at 400-600 mg. Its a reliable base for bipolar disorder for me.

My weight is 190 lbs. Taking 200 mg lamotrigine with breakfast for about three weeks now. Experiencing little to no side effects. My dreams are more vivid and sometimes bizarre, but not nightmarish. Feeling pleased with this medicine. Also been taking Wellbutrin for the past year. Prior to my bipolar diagnosis I went through four SSRI antidepressants (Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, and Lexapro). Each of these meds pushed me into mania to varying degrees. While on SSRIs and manic, I created three unwanted pregnancies, got busted for drugs, developed a cigarette habit, quit several good jobs for petty reasons, became a heavy drinker, had short and failed relationships with women, spent money foolishly, and went bankrupt. Mine is one of the sad stories of people who went untreated/misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and proceeded to cause a lot of hardship for myself and others. To this day I still feel shame for my failures, yet at the same time I berate myself less since understanding the cause of my past behavior. My cigarette habit went away after I switched from SSRIs to Wellbutrin. Now I feel healthier and grateful. No cravings whatsoever. I take 1 mg Ativan as needed; about every one to six days. I wish I received my bipolar diagnosis 20+ years ago as my life might be very different now. I still have many years left if all goes well, so better late than never.

However, I've been decreased to 300 mg and along with my cocktail of meds, I've been pretty stable for several months.  Overall, yes, I'd recommend this drug to anyone with a mood disorder.

It smoothed the peaks and the troughs and it made me much more tolerable to those around me. I did find it impaired my memory but at least I felt I could live with myself. 

I tried to come off this medication twice but troughed into a deep depression and so recontinued the med (titrating up slowly).  My reasons for coming off were that after about 3 years I did find the effectiveness to diminish. 

I'm now in a situation where there is less stress in my life and I've come off it again - no depression troughs and its been three months.

If I hadn't lined up a long period away from my work, and with reduced responsibilities, support from psych services and my doctor etc I never would have considered coming of this drug. 

In the future I may go back on. I was on 200mg so I'm guessing a more effective dose would be 300-400. Some people on this site have mentioned that they are on 600mg. As far as I know the maximum recommended dose as per my Psychiatrist is 400 - worth checking out!

I've read some comments here about people getting a skin rash when taking it and then waiting for it to go away. Don't do this. If a rash appears go straight back to your Dr as quick as you can. This was the one side effect that I feared from this med and titrating up slowly makes this reaction less probable."

I started small dose (25mg) and gradually went up to 200mg. I was on that dose for a year when I developed a rash. I had gone through Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome (SJS) while on Tegrotol 2 years before starting Lamictal so I knew what I was looking at. Went straight to ER and got treatment (was in ER just short of 24 hours). This case of rash only lasted 3-4 weeks. The first one was misdiagnosed and took 8-10 weeks of oral pred to clear up. I was lucky to avoid hospital but just barely. Skin sloughed including GI tract. Dry eyes is a warning sign-contact your doctor right away. I am no longer eligible for lasik surgery because of SJS. I lost 60# due to loss of appitite/taste buds.

Now, having said all the horrible things above, Lamictal was one of the best drugs I have ever been prescribed! While on maintenance dose I felt more ""balanced"" (I hate the word normal, don't you? What is normal anyway?) than I ever have. I know many people on this drug with no problems. I think this is a great drug worth giving a try. I would like to give this drug a try again but I'm diabetic and can't endanger my vision any more than I have."

I've been taking 200 mgs a day for a few years now. There are very little side effects. I just feel drowsy after I take it so I might switch to taking it at night instead of the morning. I've occasionally had some little bumps that appear on my hands but I think it's when I've missed my meds or I'm stressed and scratch at myself. 

I never developed an actual rash as a side effect but I've noticed that it makes your skin sensitive to develop a rash but nothing dangerous. Like when I have broken out with a couple bumps and I get anxious --- if I keep scratching then it will turn into a rash and look swollen (different than if you were off the meds and would scratch yourself). But my skin isn't sensitive to heat or touch. I hope that makes sense the way I'm trying to explain it.

No memory problems. No weight gain. No sex drive issues.

I still have depression but nothing like when I'm off the meds. I've thought about increasing it but I'm not sure if I would have memory problems? or if it would kill my creative drive. Being an artist, I don't want to get rid of my manic states completely and be ""flat"" all the time. 

Prozac and wellbutrin caused memory problems and made me feel ""flat"" and I didn't want to work or create anything. I also gained 70 lbs and had no sex drive. Wrong meds for me.

I recommend Lamictal. As with most meds, when you are first taking it and increasing your dosage, you will experience some anxiety, shakes, etc. but it goes away within a couple weeks."

I was on effexor from age 13 to 16 but for some reason it stopped working and I stated getting really bad depression again. I wouldn't say I'm very manic - I mostly have the lows, not so much the highs. I've been stable for about 5 or 6 years now with no problems and I make sure to stay that way but limiting my alcohol intake and pretty much eliminating any recreational drug use. I find that I am always much better off with my meds if I'm consistantly sober. I also exercise a lot and get enough sleep. One side effect I have is my libido is pretty much nonexistant, but I've been on these meds since before I was sexually active so I cannot say for sure that the meds are what causes that. This is the reason I am on here though - to see if anyone else has this problem. Overall I really appreciate everything Lamictal has done for me. 
Additionally, I also take the generic version and have no found any differences in it's effects. "

I tend to find, from myself and others, that these psychological drugs just change the problem.  Instead of being depressed you have headaches, blurred vision and mental confusion.  Now this is not to say that the switch is bad, it's often better, but it's certainly not optimal.  Once you accept this you might feel better about your situation.

I have found that the headaches and lack of mental clarity are the worst for me.  I'm a grad student so this is certainly not the best fit for me.  But as I said earlier, it's better than being depressed and not having the desire to use my mental functions at all.  

I think that this drugs work best when you are under the careful watch of a doctor who really take the time to have a close relationship with you.  Any kind of medication like this could be a short-term solution, a few years maybe.  It's a means to an end.  The end in this case is dealing with depression, mood swings and anxiety.  To many doctors seem to think the medication is the end solution.  I really look forward to the day I no longer have to take lamictal or any alternative.  As long as you have that goal in mind, you express that clearly to your doctor and he's willing to help you reach that goal, the drug can help in the meantime.  You just have to willing to accept the side effects, which as I said, while no fun in their own right, are often preferable to the alternative.   "

The first thing the new one did was put me on Lamictal, without even asking about how I was doing on my other meds. I had been in remission for 8 years. Since then, I've gone into a horrible episode, the worst I've ever had. First, I was so manic that I ran up bills of over $30K, on my spouse's credit card without his knowledge, then taking out several loans in my own name and spending it all. I don't have anything to show for all this money, I don't even know what I spent most of it on, except for little junky stuff like movie memorabilia, stuff off eBay, groceries, stuff at WalMart, clothes and shoes that didn't fit and I ended up giving to Goodwill.

I sleep only about 2 hours a night, on the couch. I haven't been in my bedroom for several months, take a shower maybe twice a month when My husband forces me to, barely eat anything and have lost 50+ pounds (I'm now under 100 pounds and still losing). And the pdoc will not entertain the thought that maybe my meds need adjusting. I've brought it up 3 times, and he says things like ""there's no pill that's going to make your problems go away,"" ""it's not the Lamictal,"" and stuff like that. It's like he doesn't want to admit that maybe he was wrong? I've been looking for another doc, but no luck; I live in such a small town and there's only one who works with bipolars.

I could leave it at that.  But I would like to tell you HOW.

I have been suffering with bipolar 2 for 6 years now.  I literally thought I had become a crazy, worthless person.  I couldn't remember conversations with co-workers and I think I was about to lose my job.  My boss told me to see a psychiatrist.  He is a good guy...I think that was going to be the last attempt for him to help me before firing me.

I used to be a highly functioning person.  I managed to graduate from college with a 3.2 GPA without going to class even 50% of the time.  I loved physical activity and reading and music.

6 years ago everything changed.  I was in a grad program and failed out.  I was going to class and studying constantly but I was having major memory problems.  Then I started having depression, then hypomanic episodes.  I was just a complete mess.

My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal slowly while slowly weaning me off of Lexapro.  Now I am at 400mg daily and I feel wonderful.  I am back to being a highly active, functioning person.  I am me for the first time in 6 years.

My husband is delighted--he only knew me AFTER the bipolar set in.  He has loved me through all of this, but now he is just amazed at what a better person I have become.  Still me, obviously, but without all of the drama.  :-)

Not every drug is right for everyone.  Lamictal was just the one that was right for me.  I am a success story.  I am so happy to have my life back.  "

It put me very near death and I am extremely lucky to be alive (according to the Dr.). I took Lamictal for a month at the age of 21 and it actually was great for my bipolar symptoms.  I had tried so many medications that did not work and Lamictal finally helped.  However, at the end of that first month I rode an ambulance and helicopter to 3 different hospitals and ended up in a burn center.  I suffered burns for head to toe; inside and out.  The palms of my hands and the soles of my feet actually peeled off in whole. The result actually changed my eyesight (I found out later that people actually have gone blind).It was devastating for me, my family, and my friends.  8 years later I still suffer from effects as well as have scars all over my body. I would risk Stevens-Johnson syndrome (my experience caused by the use of Lamictal)for anything.

I saw absolutely no improvement in my mood and irritability. It gave me terrible rashes and the weight gain and possible side effects just created a lot of anxiety for me. They did not give me the correct instructions to never take it at night and it can inhibit sleep and it took my doctor more than a month to figure out what was causing my terrible insomnia! I was put on quite a cocktail of drugs in the meantime to fix my insomnia and anxiety and overall it was just not worth it. It was a combination of incompetence on my doctor's end and the incompatibility of the medication.

The following side effects were experienced: yawning constantly/eyes watering, fatigue/tired/ emotional numbing, easily bruising/petechiae down both of my arms quite often, weight gain.  You might think that ""emotional numbing"" would be an appropriate result for this indication (suspected bipolar); however, just a couple weeks after all the medications were out of my system I was much happier and felt a *normal* range of emotions again.  Have not taken drugs since (5 yrs) and have been fine and successful, looking to get into med school.  Worse (and common) side effect: cognitive/memory impairment- to the point of very frequently having my mind go blank during conversations or contemplating things, also my short term memory was shot. I do not see how one could take this drug and ""function"" (really live).  Be wary of this diagnosis in the first place- demand that any organic medical cause (especially thyroid disease as it features psychiatric symptoms) be found and treated first, and optimize your diet and lifestyle. Best wishes."

I was prescribed lamotrigine and seroquel. I was slowly brought up to 100 mg. I started cycling rapidly in December. My depression cycle wasn't nearly as depressed as usual(always dreaded the down side.)My practitioner went over how and when I was to take seroquel and increased my Seroquel dose to 100mg, but left my lamotrigine dose at 100mg since it seemed to be working for the depressive episodes . In the 5th month i had an extremely mean manic episode for three days, followed by 2 days of extreme depression where I couldn't leave the house without crying, pretty much, the whole time I was out. My dose was increased to  200mg/day and my seroquel was also increased to 200mg. Within a month I felt better and I finally am thinking more clearly. I'm starting to think I can trust my own judgement again. 
I believe I have finally found the dose that works for me. My manic episodes are usualy the opposite of the way I should be feeling in certain situations.
I do have an increase of appetite and only in the past 2 months did I gain 10 lbs. There are other factors that may be the reason for this. By keeping in mind that it increases appetite I watch my portions and try to avoid snacking. Difficult but doable. 
During the first 5-6 months I would get really drowsy but I had changed from a 2nd shift job to a 3rd shift one. now that I'm unemployed I have a better sleep pattern and  I no longer get as drowsy.
In summary I am very happy with the combinatio and dose of my meds. Keep in mind every one is different. Most importantly take them faithfully. I had some problems when I'd miss a few doses. I am afraid not to take them."

None severe enough, in my opinion, to stop taking the meds. My relationship with my wife has turned around completely!

I had read another review that the generic brand did not work for them and I can tell you that is not all in your head!!!  I took generic wellbutrin (TEVA) and had a horrible, terrifying experience with it!! I would highly reccomend people stay away from any drugs made by TEVA!! There is a program called ""Bridges to Access"" where if you don't have prescription coverage and meet the income guidelines, you may be able to receive the name brand drugs for a small or no co-pay.

Over the past 20 yrs I have been diagnosed as having manic-depression, OCD, anxiety attacks, and most recently ADD. I take 200 mg of Lamictal in the morning, along with Buspirone (anxiety) and Dextroamphetamine (ADD). Occasionally I experienced a loss in my sense of balance, blurred vision, insomnia, and lower back pain. In the past 6 mos. these symptoms have become more intense, especially the back/hip pain and inability to fall sleep at night, as well as now experiencing some hair loss and a loss in my ability to concentrate. My psychiatrist felt this was due to stress, but I have become concerned after reading more about the drugs I am taking. My family physician does not feel there is any danger in the combination of pills I am taking, but also recommended that I trust my body's reactions. If I miss taking my meds for just one day, I am lethargic, sleepy, cranky and feel ill usually within 2-3 hours. When this happens on a weekend day, I will hole myself up and not leave the house. After reading all of the posts on this site, I want to see about talking with another pyschiatrist and the possibility of going off this medication. Please remember this is just my experience with Lamictal and besides the other medications, I'm sure there are many other variables in my situation.

Sounds like alot, but I have a high tolerance for pain and drugs.  Been on both for 4 years now - increased dose from 200 to 250 after coming off of meds during a pregnancy.  Was diagnosed bipolar at the age of 29 when mania set in. I love it - saved my life and my husbands. He had actually attempted suicide a few times before I was able to convince him to go to the doctor. He had social anxiety as well (which I think all bipolar people have).  You can't miss a pill and expect it to work - kind of like birth control. But the daily pill is worth the happiness, satisfaction and focus it brings to your life. I feel normal for the 1st time in my life.  I recently started taking the generic when it became available (so much cheaper), but after reading other's comments I think I'm going to go back to brand name.  I've been itching like crazy too - thought it was allergies.  And my mood swings have been wider with a poorer attention span.  I go to the doctor in a couple of days and was going to ask for a higher dose - I think switching back to name brand will relieve the new symptoms.  When I did quit taking the meds for my pregnancy I was so miserable - the only thing that kept alive were the babies inside me.  Had twins and didn't hold them but once or twice for the first week.  If anyone out there has stayed on lamictal throughout a prenancy (with or without issues) I would love to hear from you.  I want to try for another baby, but I'm not sure I (or my husbandd) can make it w/out the medicine. Good luck to all, I know how hard it is to find the right combo of drugs.  Just don't give up.

I love having to take 1 medication to treat both Bipolar and epilepsy. I have been on this medication off and on for about 3 years.  I was taking Lamictal and then switched to Depakote then switched back to Lamictal because the side effects of Depakote were that bad.  I take 200mg 2X a day and it has totally controlled my seizures.  I have some dizziness still but that's because all of my medications may cause dizziness.  It hasn't totally controlled my Bipolar so I am also on Geodon and Prozac.  Since April I have been doing really well.  I have never taken Lithium but my sister has and she has warned me to never let my doctors put me on that.  I haven't really had any bad side effects from Lamictal so I am very pleased with it.

I was diagnosed February my freshmen year of high school and they put me on Lamictal in June.  It treated some of my symptoms in the first month: extreme interest in sex, delusional thinking, depression, and others I can't even remember because they stopped.  I am a junior and I have been taking it.  I still have episodes and I am on Seroquel as well, but I do not have major depressive episodes anymore. I thought I was crazy before I took this medicine.  I didn’t want to live anymore and I thought I was just a sick twisted person.  It turns out I was sick, but not the monster I thought I was.  This medicine changed my life and saved me from myself.  When you first start taking it, the first week or two you are tired, but it goes away as your body adjusts.  Lamictal is a really good treatment for teenagers suffering from manic, depressive and hyper-manic episodes (Especially depressive: I was suffering depression my entire freshmen year until I got help).   Make sure that when you make changes with any kind of medication (doses or starting new ones), you do it when you are on some sort of break where you can adjust without stress and sleep.  I’m not sure how it works for others, everyone has different brain chemistries, but Lamictal works very well for me.

My doctor suggested taking the BRAND name of th Lamictal and it has worked wonderfully, he told me that alot of people have more adverse reactions to the generic and he didn't want to take a chance due to some other medications that I have to take. I still feel a little fussy but I am just now in the process of increasing the dose from the starter pack and now I'm on the 100mg-and the funny part is even my kids (11 & 13) can tell a huge difference. My husband has told me that I seem much calmer and that is a good thing considering he got the butt end of a lot of my aggression. Thank GOD for this medication and thank goodness for my doctor. I feel like a different person. Before the Lamictal, I was in the bed,grouchy,mean and didn't want to do or go anywhere.

While it helps with rage-related mania, impulsivity, and the severest of depression, it has not been a miracle drug.
It has worked best when combined with 400mg of Tegretol a day, which is my current regime....(and I have tried MANY MANY different combos of meds) Only problem? I don't have insurance and it costs approx. $320/month. 
Generic is at $230. It will go down, but I've been pissed about it for a while. I tried to come off of it once when my insurance ran out, and it was the worst I have ever felt in my life. In short, I am addicted to it. If I could weather the withdrawal, I'd like to come off it, but as it stands now, I am not emotionally ready for that undertaking."

It was on both of my forearms and itched like crazy but went away in 2 hours. Pharmacist said that as long as it didn't hurt and no other side effects (fever, etc) then I was OK. Just be careful and always let a pharmacist or your doctor know if you get the rash no matter how small it may be."

-complusive behavior has increased
 i.e. obsessively rethinking my thoughts of things I have problems with, things I have to accomplish, things I want to remember, and what I feel I need to say to others.
-More apt to become instantly frustrated and angry at the person/or persons I have a difficulty with.
-Depression symptoms have increased drastically. Although suicidal behavior is almost non-existant (due to the many 'eye-opening' hospitalization experiences)
 i.e. When upset, I cry intensly and obsessively think of my problems. These emotions seem to be short-lived and change surprisingly often. (Currently, I am undignosed with neither Bi-polar (manic-depression) or any other anger problems. I am dignosed with ADHD and a severe manic- depression disorder. I show traits of Borderline and Histrionic Personality disorders. my Doctors seems to be stumpted on what to do, seeing as I've been on just about every medication. So we're trying one of our last hopes, Lamictal.)
-My mood seems to be de-stablizing as I continue to take Lamictal. I dont Know whether or not it has anything to do with the concerta I recently started but my advice, If it means much coming from a very emotionally conflicted teen-age boy, but I advise great caution when taking this medication, especially when starting it. Severe side effects can occur. It is a anti-seizure medication, newly used as a mood-stablizer medication. Obviously you have to be carefully prescribed this medication by a professional, and you cannot miss doses. It can directly affect your circulatory and heart (cardio) systems.  
I highly recommend talking to your doctor, as I have an appointment next week. Im going to tell my doctor all of my symptoms, and so should you. If you are having negative symptoms with this medication. DO NOT give up hope on recovery, for I WILL NOT.

49$Rapid Cycle Manic-Depression$11/3/2015 10:40:16 AM$Reviewer: MaryJune, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I had a life-threatening reaction to lamotrigine, but because the ER dismissed it as the cause of my symptoms, I tried taking it a second time. The reaction was even worse. I did some research and learned that, while uncommon, when lamotrigine does have an adverse effect, it is a serious one. My reaction appeared within 30 minutes of taking it and manifested as the worst flu ever - violent vomiting, severe migraine, uncontrollable chills and shaking, and dangerously low blood pressure. In the following two weeks I was confused, light-headed, and very weak. It took over two weeks for my blood pressure to return to normal. These episodes surprised (and terrified) me, because not only was this a low dose, but I have never before had a bad reaction to a medication. ANY drug has the potential to do harm as well as good. That doesn't mean you should not try taking something; it just means you need to be aware of the possibility, AND you need to trust your own instincts. Never allow a ""professional"" to tell you how you feel, just because he or she has not encountered it before. "

I've been taking it for about four years and for the first time since puberty I have been almost completely  stable. I had trouble with anger and frequently losing my temper, self-harm, and compulsive exercising due to Bipolar II, and that has almost completely stopped since I started taking Lamotrigine. I went from several episodes per week to 2 in the past year.
124$Rapid Cycle Manic-Depression$2/7/2013 4:47:15 AM$Reviewer: BU, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I find it odd that so many people have such bad reviews yet also take an other prescribed medication. You have to take into consideration the fact that this medication reacts differently when there are multiple medications in your system. My doctor suggested Lamictal to me first for bipolar 2 disorder. I refused to take it because I had heard about the rash / stephen johnson syndrome, it had always been a fear so I absolutely refused to try it. I tried Abilify first, It seemed to change my life for the best until I started becoming exhausted and could barely walk down the street without having to rest. Could barely drive without having to take a nap on the side of the road. Turned out to be a side effect and I was taken off. I tried lithium as it was ""affordable"" and typical, it did nothing good for me, I was having awful mixed states, sudden crying spells, overly sensitive, and could not sit still for a minute, nothing improved so he took me off of it. Even with just two trials I told the doctor ""fine, i'll try lamictal"" well, about a year later it's changed my life for the good. I hate relying on medication but in all honesty the way this has helped me is well worth some sort of reliance. This was mostly to treat my depression, I don't get depressed as much anymore. I do have a phase here and there but it is much less severe than it used to be, i'll feel down but not so suicidal and completely worthless anymore. I will say though that the past two weeks have been interesting, I cannot tell what state I am in, I have once again become overly sensitive and easily irritable, the physical pain i've been in lately has been so confusing and awful (numb hands, tingling, crying, headaches, feeling light headed) very strange signs. Could easily be from something else but it's almost as if the meds just quit working out of the blue. However although i'm dealing with this, the depression is still nothing compared to what it used to be. "

I was started on 25mg to move up after 1 week to 50 and was on it 5 days. The first few days I had severely painful headaches with pressure, my face twitches, my eyes rolled and darted back and forth and my jaw was clenched constantly. I had an extremely painful and stiff neck. Day 3 the pain was in all my muscles and joints and I had tremors. Day 5 and things got so bad I nearly went to an ER. 9 pm at night I started feeling like I was having a panic attack (I do have panic disorder). It felt as if my chest was in a vice grip and I couldn't breathe, my heart was beating rapidly/starting and stopping, pounding, I could see it pulse through my stomach. I had cramping in my abdomen and my neck was so stiff I couldn't move it. I did not sleep but more than that I couldn't move for hours. I laid in the fetal position completely wide eyed and in a state of what I mistook to be panic. My panic attacks have never lasted more than an hour or two. This lasted for 16 hours. I had to work in the morning and went to work on 0 sleep and all of symptoms kept worsening. I also had class but decided to go home to try to sleep because I was in so much pain. I started to put two and two together when everything in my body lit on fire. It felt like I had a sunburn, especially on my chest and back and neck. I called my prescriber and they said to stop taking it and to take the hydroxyzine because ""it sounds like the beginning of an allergic reaction"" as well as adverse effects. That makes it sound like they're competent and concerned...they aren't. They pushed this drug on me even though I was hesitant. It's five days later and only now am I starting to feel slightly back to normal but my face is still clenching and ticking and I'm still in pain. It took a few days for my pulse to even out, too. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS EVER"

I gained 130lbs on it. Zyprexa was the only drug I tried out of many that worked. After that I destabilized and had rapid mood swings and stopped sleeping. I found a new psychiatrist and he put me on Lamictal and Geodon. Within a month my mood swings greatly improved. And within 2 months I felt like a normal healthy human being again and my mood swings were relieved. Now, I no longer feel depressed or manic. I just feel happy all the time. I don't have anxiety anymore. I don't have depression anymore. I don't worry or get upset about every little thing anymore. This drug combo is like a miracle to me. Very easy to use with no side effects at all.

This was the fifth medication I have been on in the past seven years (they become ineffective after a while... or I stop fooling myself and recognize the symptoms again).

It has worked wonderfully for my manic episodes. The last two years I was switched to the generic brand by my insurance. During this time I had began getting a serious rash and redness and rash on my neck area, this past year I have developed blotches on my shoulders and upper arms as well as the shoulder blade areas. It is slowly working its way down my arms and back. My doctor gave me an ointment prescription which is working, but has concerns of the effects being related to Lamictal. He is weening me off due to the potential seriousness of this side affect. I am disappointed with this as the drug has worked perfectly for my condition, however, I appreciate his legitimate concern. I almost wonder if the generic brand may be the difference in my skin condition, where it has changed since being on the generic brand, rather than the name brand Lamictal oral. Regardless, should my rash subside once off the med completely, I will need to have a replacement med which i dread the experimental stage of alternatives. Lamictal has been perfect for me. I hate the thought of experimenting with other drugs due to concerns of being drowsy, high or always groggy from any particular med. I had once been on Depakote, which was a total nightmare. I can't bear the play on my system during this trial/error process. If the rash continues, the dr. will be sending me to a specialist to have allergy testing done. Yey.....  "

It was like the sun came out and the clouds parted. This was what it was like to feel in control of my life. Much less socializing without abandon, drinking, partying and spending money I didn't have. I was able to OBSERVE my impulses so I could decide whether or not to let them take over me.
I had NEVER known what being ""normal"" was like. I felt like I could handle the anxiety and stress surrounding me with grace, maturity. My mood didn't dictate my actions as much.
Then, my state's insurance company dropped me because I was taking classes at community college. I couldn't afford anything, not my psychiatry appts or my therapy. Apparently, if I can pay for school, I can pay for Blue Cross/Blue shield lower income insurance.
Despair overtook me and I fell into a manic spiral of rapid cycling destructive behavior and avoidance,hiding in bed, isolating, crying all the time for no reason behavior. One day I was on top of the world, and everyone wanted to be around me. I loved life. The next, I hated myself and wanted to die. When I came out of that, I was an arrogant Bitch who thought she deserved better. Then I would suddenly feel inspired to get things done and have a normal day. I could feel my adderall working on those days. I could focus, but everything was short lived.
I finished my classes and the state insurance picked me up again. I got back on Lamictal but had to take the Generic. I didn't care. I was SO HAPPY to get back on my mood stabilizer! About a month went by, then 2 weeks, and I met with my PA. I felt very laid back about chaos in my life. I didn't notice anything different. My attitude and quality of life had not improved on the Generic. but it hadn't really gotten worse. I felt like I always had. She switched me back to brand name and things started to improve again. Now taking tablets instead of ODT because of Medicaid. I notice quite a difference in side effects. Has anyone else switched? Effectiveness/infectiveness?"
