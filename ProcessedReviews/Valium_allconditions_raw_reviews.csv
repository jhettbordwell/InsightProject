I have tried the REAL Roche Brand Valium AND the generic and they both suck; either on high or low doses. I have severe anxiety, PTSD and symptoms of DID. My old psych. thought this was med was the messiah of benzos!  The only thing that works for me is lorazepam/Ativan, Klonopin/clonazepam or Xanax/alprazolam - which I do not like taking, but will they will help my panic.  I had a severe panic attack with dissociation and kept taking diazepam and waited and waited for it to work to kill the attack - it took forever.  If I had any other Benzo, like lorazepam or Klonopin it would have killed the panic attack in 20 minutes.  Thumps down for diazepam for me. However, everyone is different.  It's supposed to be a good med to wean off other benzos.

11$Condition: Chronic Trouble Sleeping$4/4/2018 10:31:57 AM$Reviewer: Recent Widow, 75 or over on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Doctor order 5 mg to be taken 1/2 to 1 at bed time.  Took 1/2 which did nothing so a few hours took the other 1/2.  Did this for a few nights.  Decided to take a whole tablet.  Still couldn't sleep.  Next day I could not function.  Could not breathe.  Ambulance came and EMT got my breathing controlled.  I had trouble answering their questions.  Could not read my signature when I signed their form.  Three days later I am still having problems with dizziness.  Afraid to drive and cannot walk far.  Will see my doctor when she gets back to the office.  Went back to my regular medication for depression.  Was a terrible experience for me, my family and friends.

Oddly enough this helps with the knots and the pain associated with them to varying degrees. I take it as needed and sometimes it completely stops the muscle spasms and sometimes it barely does a thing, regardless of the spasm intensity. I wish there was more consistency but this is the only medication that seems to help so I'll take what I can get. Also makes me a bit loopy to varying degrees. Feels good but not exactly useful for trying to get things done plus I sometimes get depressed coming off it.

I suffer from chronic anxiety and no other medications have helped.  I have tried so many.  I started taking it 30 years ago and many Dr's have advised that I stop.  I did stop for 1 year about 8 years ago and it was the worst year that I can remember.   I hate that it is habit forming but it is the only thing I have found that helps me get through the day.  I will probably have to take if for the rest of my life and I am fine with that, if only every new doctor I saw would not try to be the one who can get me off of it!!  They make it for a reason.  I keep my dosage between 10 and 20 mg per day.

I can take up to 10mg. They work very well for me. At first, my salivation production increased when I took this medicine and I would also have sleepiness, but these no longer bother me when I take this medicine. It works very well for me when I take it and I can always rely on diazepam to help me if I get too anxious and cannot control it.

At 67 Yrs. old, for the 1st. time in my life I've spent most of it in the hospital They even thought my care giver was trying to poison me, no one understood why I was on oxygen at home & my son or neighbor would find me unconscious & I would ""wake up"" in I.C.U., that is the ""scariest"" scariest place you ever want to come too at in your life. Especially with a tube down your throat. I can sort of understand why they don't want me to have valium, but besides panic attacks, I start breathing so hard thinking I'm going to die right there & ten, I want to take the valium.  Now if I could only quit smoking for good, maybe I could go off oxygen for good. But when they tell you you're going to die, because you have no lung capacity remaining is it, a pill, or a cigarette that will be it?
Every day I wonder, when I'm sitting here alone in the a.m. what am I supposed to do. If someone's gone through this, or has any idea's let me know please. I am scared."

I went to a psychiatrist after a very severe attack and, although none of the SSRIs they wanted me on helped (all horrible side effects) this medication has stayed with me for 6+ years. At one point I was able to taper off to a mere 1mg 3xday, but stress related to PTSD caused me to have to return to 15mg a day. My Dr has me on a irregular schedule where I take different amounts throughout the day which really helps me. I take very little in the morning, but the most in the afternoon. Very rarely, like the holidays, I need to take an extra few mgs for a racing heartbeat. Other than short term memory loss I have had no negative sides. I always keep a notepad and pen with me now.

I have some bad days and Diazepam is my drug of choice as it seems to level me out and even 5mg puts me in a much better mood. 

My other half tells me to take them some days. I am glad when someone else knows I am in trouble as I may not know it as I am sure others may not know either. But what a relief to me and anyone around me Diazpam is.

 I wish I had taken this and never tried any antidepressants, which I no longer take. This little pills just lightens up those bad days. 

Best drug I have tried to help me. I pray no side effects and I DO NOT use it daily because I do not want an addiction and I want that 5mg pill to work when I need it to.  It only stays in the liver 2 days so that helps as the liver has been effected by other pills in the past. Happy this one has not turned me yellow! I am hoping to no longer need them some day. But for now, I am happy they help.

Highly suggested for anyone like be who has been thru a lifetime of hurt and surgeries and needs a little help.

 I do not drive under any medication, even diazapam. You never know what a drug will do to your mind and if I hurt anyone with my car, I would never forgive myself if I were taking any drug that alters moods or mind or not for that matter. 
You can always take your pill when you get to work and it has its 8 or so hours to work. No sense taking it before work, not when you are driving.

It is a drug, but a good one as far as I am concerned. 
May God Bless..."

I need to take something, or I'm a wreck) for up to four hours, and when it wears off, I don't have any bad feelings. It also doesn't make me super sleepy, like Xanax did, so I can take it while I'm at work and not be a zombie. LOVE IT. "

79$Condition: Anxious$3/5/2012 6:04:12 PM$Reviewer: BarneyFife, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Years ago I was prescribed 5mg 3 times per day for acute anxiety and depression related to 'adjustment to adult life'.  I took Valium for about 3 months, then weened myself off.  It was as if a switch had been thrown, turning off my panic and turning on simple normalcy.  I credit Valium for saving my life.  In recent years I have used it during episodes of acute lower back spasm, and once again it has come to the rescue.  I use it only for the purpose intended and for the minimum length of time required for resolution of the problem.  Haven't noticed any negative side effects other than a mild sedation which is a good thing during a panic attack.  In my experience, this is one of those rare chemicals I can call a 'wonder drug', but it must be used appropriately, following the recommendations of a doctor or WebMD or the PDR.  Don't take it lightly.

I've been on it for just under 10 yrs. 10mgx4 daily. It's been used mostly to help with sleep and muscle spasms along with other musclerelaxors. I've also needed it for anxiety once in awhile. For the most part I would say it's by far the best of the benzodiazepines. I'm lucky in a way that if I decide to take a holiday away from my prescriptions, I don't have any withdrawal symptoms. I have a strange tolerance to most pills, I feel that also has to do with my ADHD. It's longer acting than most benzos, but you need to be aware that it has a pretty long half life which if you're not familiar with the term, it stays in your system for about2-3 days, which is why it can be addicting cause the longer you take it, the longer it's half life is, which just stays in your system and builds a tolerance. That's the downside of the med, but it's been around for years, and I've been on many different types of benzos, and I always go back to the diazepam. I hope this may educate some a bit more than they were.

Starting with heroin,  and years of pill popping, and I finally ended up in a methadone clinic. After a year in the clinic, my detox was complete. The withdrawl I experienced from methadone was like no other. I missed work for almost a month, and didnt sleep for 7-10 days. Not a wink. By the time I saw a doctor, I was a nervous wreck, losing my mind. He prescribed Valium for sleep, the trembling, and the anxiety. Having a history of panic attacks and anxiety, I never had taken anything that actually relieved me of those symptoms. I have been off opiates and so called ""treatment"" opiates like methadone for a month and a half now, and I couldnt have done it without the medicine, and the help of family and friends. "

I may only take it a couple times a week now, as opposed to a couple times a day in the beginning. I had been given anti-depressants in the past and they made me not care about anything, and my life went down hill. When I was on and As I was trying to get off the a-d's I became depressed, which I was not depressed to begin with. Everyone is different, but Diazepam has helped me tremendously.

I have been using this for 15 months to treat acute vertigo associated with Ménière's Disease.  It has been very useful in treating symptoms of the strong vertigo attacks that I experience 1 to 5 times per month. When I have a severe case of vertigo I use 10 to 30 mg per day for 1-3 days until the symptoms subside.  Sometimes I use 5 to 10 mg to help with a mild vertigo attack with a short duration (4-6 hours). This drug has helped me manage my symptoms and has 'given me my life back' compared to the time I spent prior to being prescribed diazepam.  It doesn't totally eliminate the veritigo but it does reduce it and helps me to endure the attacks of dizziness.

Side Effects: I sometimes feel drowsy or not as mentally sharp as I'd like to be. My experience with this drug is that it often causes mild constipation. Recommend eating lots of fruits and vegetables when taking."

172$Condition: Other$11/14/2009 10:35:34 AM$Reviewer: mitchb, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$5$I've been on 10 mg per day for 40 years. Being on a low dosage for years I thought withdrawal would be relatively easy as I only take one pill a day. Last week I tried going without and I went completely out of my head after 4 days without. I gave in and took one and when I told my Dr about it she was understanding but told me I will probably be better just to continue my once a day pill forever as no one  should go through benzodiazepine withdrawal. I must agree. The point is that if you use this medication for too long you may develope an addiction which may appear to be next to impossible to break. It can be done but must be done painfully slow and tapered off until one takes a very low dose every second day etc. If using this medication be prepared to possibly be on it for  a while. If your using this medication on a short term basis(2 weeks) then you will be fine. It is when using this med for a month or more that the addiction is hard and can be dangerous. All that said if using this mediocation on a longer term then you will be OK as long as you don't overuse or underuse. Also remember that if your Dr puts you on this med that he or she knows the consequences and deems the use more important than the possible side effects including possible true addiction. After my attempt to quit last week I now have accepted the fact I will probably be taking my one pill a day forever. If I do reattempt withdrawal from diazepam I would get to the point where I would cut it down to a mg once evey two days and then maybe I might stand a chance. An addiction specialist explained to me that since I only take one pill a day and have been doing so for almost 40 years that I should just continue to take it as long as I do not increase my dose without approval. On the positive side this benzo may be good because of it's long half life in the body. It's benzos like Xanax one may best be avoiding as they can induce withdrawal much faster having a short half life in the body.Goodluck

I am downing my dosage to get off the Methadone.  Valium 10 mg. helps me with the muslce restlessness, the inability to sleep, the anhedonia from lack of dopamine production, the dysphoria, from same lack of natural opiate production, and it generally calms the anxiety that goes with the horrible effects of coming off of precription narcotic analgesic.  I would not advise people to use Valium long term, or the withdrawal is very dangerous.  The only 2 meds that most insurance will pay for inpatient detox from are alcohol and benzodiazepines.  The seizures with both are very serious, potentially fatal with the right circumstances.  Used correctly, however, Valium makes the withdrawal from Morphine/Methadone/Codiene/Oxy or hydrocodone tolerable - but incomplete alone.  They treat the symptoms, but not the condition, so to speak.  Also, Valium is helpful for panic attacks, but not so much after an attack is mid-episode.  Good preventative for panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder.  If you TRULY are suffering with anxiety, and you REALLY want to get better, you need to mix the Valium with counseling.  Look for a counselor who does (Brief) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, aka C.B.T.  They use techniques like Systematic Desensitization if you can identify some situations that cause your attacks, but most ppl cannot.  So they teach you Relaxation Techniques, to sort of put yourself into a self-hynotic state of calmness.  It is basically a good diversion while the episode passes on its on.  Well, I hope this helps someone out.  I studied pharmacology as a requirement for my undergrad degree, and I am in grad school now, working on a degree in MPH (Public Health), in an area called Epidemiology, so I am not completely ""full of it.""  I also have some obvious personal experience with addiction, stemming from military service in the sandbox.  DocXYZM.  "

The Dr. Gave me Vicodin and Diazepam(Valium) for pain and discomfort. Of course I started with the Vicodin, but it made me sick to my stomach,did little for the pain and wired me so I could not sleep. So I started taking the Diazepam with a half of Vicodin. After about 30min. the pain was almost gone and I could sleep comfortably. Very good drug. 10mg 3 times a day, but I was usually ok with just taking one in the morning on an empty stomach and then one before bed.

This is less than $10 for 30 days compared to well over $100.
I've found these work just as well if not even a little better in some ways. I do fall asleep quickly enough. I stay asleep all night.
My only complaints are (1) I do not feel as rested as I did when on the meds specifically designed to aid sleep and (2) I can have a little trouble some mornings with a feeling of grogginess. But I've experienced the groggy issue on other meds too.
If you have trouble falling asleep - staying asleep or - like me - are often awakened throughout the night by something out of your control - pain wakes me up - and if you don't have insurance this is a great option. I do suggest trying it on a night when you don't have to drive the next morning so as to see if it causes a problem in the morning.
Good luck and God bless."

I hate to say it like this, but after taking this it feels - to me - like I felt back in the days when I drank like I'd had one or two beers. I am calm but not loopy. I feel good but not in an artificial way. I'm still alert enough to function - on one 5mg.
I've used Xanax before and either one works fine. If you start to feel one is not working as well as before you may want to discuss alternating between the two with your doctor to keep your body from becoming too used to either one.
I only gave 4 stars for satisfaction because my only issue with the medication is that it can make me sleepy if I'm already predisposed to feeling tired, e.g. late at night, hard day at work, etc.."
225$Condition: Muscle Spasm$9/27/2008 11:34:57 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$"I am currently being treated for lymphedema in the lower legs (both). The treatment started causing what felt like every muscle from below the knee down to start cramping. The top of my feet, the calf, the shin all started tightening relentlessly.  It was not like a simple ""charley horse.""  It was many times more painful and, it would not work itself out by standing or walking. I was nearly brought to tears because both legs were locking up and there was nothing I could do.
I now take one 10mg before bed each night and this seems to keep everything relaxed.
I also recommend drinking lots of water, increasing your potassium intake and doing light stretching. You may even want to look into cutting-down on your dairy because this can cause muscle spasms for some people.
Another ""trick"" I've tried is drinking pickle juice. I can not say for sure it works in and of itself because I've used it in conjunction with the other tips mentioned here. But on the rare occasion that the cramps feel like they might come back I drink a small glass just to have the added benefit. Even if it's only psychological that's a plus because stress can be a catalyst to some degree.
Good luck to all of you and may God bless."

232$Condition: Anxious$9/6/2008 8:48:26 PM$Reviewer: Lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$" I LOVE this drug.  I have been using it sparingly and only ""as needed"" for almost 20 years.  It is just as effective today as it was back then, and at the same dosage.  If I feel very anxious I take 2.5mg and I am calmer within a very short time.  If I need a good night's sleep and feel anxious, I take 2.5mg to 5mg and sleep happily for a good 6 hours. ( I need 8 hours, but this med lasts for 6 hours ).  I am 5'8 and weigh 128lbs. yet those dosages work great for me.  The greatest benefit I found was that having taken this med off & on and sparingly ""as needed"", I was able to mimick (without the drug) the CALM feeling that it gave me.  The mind is a powerful thing! It takes years of working on, but I couldn't have done it alone (without this drug).  I am at relative peace now because I am older and wiser AND because I have a great store of this drug incase I need it.  If you suffer severe Panic Attacks or severe Anxiety that you can't calm down by yourself, I highly recommend careful use of this drug. Others sware by Xanax... never tried that one.     Hang in there."

After over 2 years of searching for an answer, a very low dose (1 mg, 3 times per day) has relieved my dizziness without sedating me. In fact, I actually have MORE energy than less on this drug at this dosage level. This is an ""off-label"" use of this drug according to the neurologist that prescribed it.  It has allowed me to go back to a normal or near-normal life.  Seems odd that a medication that can make you ""dizzy"" can, in very low doses, relieve vertigo and unsteadiness.  My non-medical theory is that it calms down what I would describe as an electrical storm in my brain.  Moving scenes on TV or bright lights in a store would trigger my vertigo - no longer.

I previously tried meclizine, but even at low doses it just knocked me out and all I did was sleep the day away.

I cut 2 mg tabs in half to create my 1 mg doses.  The plan is to cut back to 2 mg/day after a couple of months and see how it goes."

I suffer from severe PTSD, have insomnia and suffer from muscle spasms, all due to an MBA I was in in 1984. I have found from all the benzodiazepine family, diazepam works the best for me. The others are all too short acting, or make me feel like a zombie. Valium is definitely the best choice for my ails! I also take Dilaudid and fentanyl for pain and find that with the valium, I can still lead a fairly normal life. 
284$Condition: Anxious$1/8/2019 12:40:04 PM$Reviewer: 75 or over on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$5$4$Been dealing with anxiety and depression since being diagnosed with/treated for prostate cancer in 2000. Take Valium on and off as needed for mild GAD and â??anticipatory anxietyâ?? (i.e. pre-travel). It also helps with morning depression. Itâ??s the only prescription med I take. Have tried several SSRIâ??s with some success, but prefer valium because it works with almost no side effects. While on Valium, after eating a meal, I may doze off for 20 or so minutes. Combination of the meal and the Valium. When taking, usually itâ??s 5mg at bedtime. Sleep better, longer, with fewer disturbing dreams. May take a 2nd 5mg during really anxious days (i.e. when packing for a trip). Will take for a couple of weeks while traveling, and no problem stopping except maybe a day of mild depression. Doesnâ??t conflict with my before-supper 2 glasses of wine, except when on Valium the size of those glasses may be smaller (more relaxed to begin with). According to blood tests over the years, doesnâ??t seem to have affected any vital organs (kidneys, liver). Continues to be a lifesaver!

Putting me into that small tunnel?? Hells no. MRI tech suggested asking for some ativan, xanax or valium.  I called my PCP and xanax was prescribed.  I asked for 2 doses worth so I could try it at home first as I had never taken it. got .05 mg.  Said to take 1 30 min before and take another in 30 min if needed.  So, I did my trial run, ended up taking 2 and felt NOTHING!! About an hour later I started feeling irritable and very impatient!! NOT results conducive of being in a MRI for almost an hour.  Called my ortho who prescribed valium. WOW, what a difference!  He gave me 2 5mg tabs with almost the same directions. Take half a tab then take another half 30 min later if needed.  3 half tabs was the bomb!! I was like - whatever, as I do not give a shit right about now... ultimate chill pill for sure! MRI success!! And I had no problem driving myself home either.  Actually stopped to get groceries on the way. If you need a MRI, go for the gold-the valium, I sure was thankful for it and had no real side effects except for wanting to take a nap later. Best of luck to all!

I've tried Lyrica, Neurontin is (gabapentin)  they are much stronger, more addictive and have worse side effects. Valium or the generic form has none. I've been able to stop at any time, just have to put up with the muscle pain and mind fog that FMS causes. Tried some of the other drugs, they fogged the mind, or caused insomnia like Xanax did. They are also MORE addictive and you have to be weaned off them. They are also  have more horrid side effects. 1 Lyrica tablet sent me to the ER because the pain it caused sent my BP to heart attack level. Took a week to get the crap out of my system.

I don't take it all the time only when I have consistent anxiety and it does help the awful closed throat, heavy heart feeling I get before I have an anxiety attack. The only problem is if I have a really bad panic attack it takes about 20 minutes to kick in and in those instances it's not quick enough. In general though this has been very effective to help calm me down with no real adverse side effects. This does not make me sleepy or groggy but I know some people that say it's a bit too much. Just watch it because it is a Benzo and it can be addictive. I only use it when I have to and haven't ever felt any withdrawal from starting and stopping as needed but that's not to say someone else wouldn't experience those not so pleasant symptoms listed as possible side effects. Just be cautious and use your better judgement while taking this.

However, the hardest thing is if you ever have to stop it without switching to another benzo.  The 2 side effects I had were the occasional headache associated with tiredness. Valium has the longest half life of any benzo and that is arguably why it is the hardest to stop after long term use. Be careful.

The Valium used in conj w pain med would bring my pain from 10 to a 4 or 5. Within few mins I would feel so much better. So I have been seeing a new pain mgmt doc in my new state for about 5 months however, he DOES NOT LISTEN to me or my concerns. HE REFUSES TO PRESCRIBE MY VALIUM. I leave his office every month crying bc the pain is so bad. He'll give me valium just prior to steroid injections but he still refuses to give me a script for the Valium. He believes that Valium is used only for a gen Anesthesia! And after 2 more injects 2 wks ago I asked yet again - his response (thru his nurse) was ""Ive had this conversation with her many times & I will not give her Valium."" ""his nurse also said Valium is not used for pain"" (of course we all k this is untrue) I immed cried, told the nurse to let him know that if God Forbid anything should happen that he cannot cont his med practice & he ends up in chronic pain as w me & other patients I bet he'll be expected his physician to listen to him. Just bc my doc is 'conservative' it is very ignorant & uncaring of him to ignore me & my pain & refuse to continue one of my meds (Valium) that my prev docs were prescribing to me. He only gives me something for the main phys pain, nothing else. Im going to my GP tm to discuss - perhaps she can help or work as a liason. I may have to find a new doc. The muscle spasms are getting so bad it hurts to breathe. To all others trying to cope w post surg pain my prayers go out to you & good luck."
330$Condition: Anxious$11/20/2013 12:33:26 AM$Reviewer: Working Man, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"Sure, there's plenty of newer, 'more powerful' benzodiazepines that've been introduced in the past 30 years (e.g., Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin)-- I've tried many of them -- but diazepam (Valium) is still the best. And safest. Here's why:

1). It's relaxing & uplifting in the most mild way. It doesn't cause wacky behavior nor give the appearance that the user is 'on something'.
2). It's long acting. You don't need to cling to a pill bottle all day. One small dose gives all-day benefit.
3.) It doesn't cause mental depression, like so many minor tranqilizers do.

I like to take a 5 mg. pill in the morning, before work. It 'loosens me up', making that tense pre-workday mood disappear. It helps me organize myself, in a cheerful way. That's the best way I can describe it. I don't take another until the next morning. And many times I don't even need to do that. Diazepam the very best of the benzodiazepines and minor tranquilizers. Speaking from experience."

366$Condition: Muscle Spasm$5/10/2012 6:13:27 AM$Reviewer: BR549, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$From 1995 to present, I have had 11 spine surgeries’, 4 in the low back and 7 in the cervical and thoracic area.  While the pain meds helped, I started having the worse spasms and the muscles in my neck and upper half of the large muscles would literally lockup and cause more pain then I can express. I started out taking Flexeril, Scalaxin, Soma and many others to no avail.  Around 2005, my Doctor switched to 10 mg. Valium 3 times a day, but I usually break them in half when I start to feel the muscles starting to get tight or spasms during day time, and a whole one at bedtime. Tho the spasms are there daily, had it not been for Valium, I don’t know what I would have done. It has truly been a godsend for me personally. The only downside is, if I have to drive myself somewhere, I won’t take it the night before as I don’t want to not be at my full faculty’s while driving, but it’s a tradeoff I accept as I have been totally disabled for about 5 years now. My spouse does 90% of the driving, with me doing about 10%. The reason for this is I know of 2 people that were arrested for driving under the influence while taking this med. I also have first hand knowledge as one of them was a friend I had been warning for years not to take it and drive. So just be very careful and use common sense while taking a 10 mg. Valium and thinking you can drive safely without having an accident that may be minor to major in nature.

370$Condition: Anxious$3/20/2012 1:58:59 AM$Reviewer: Fortressofcomfort, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$Overall diazepam is the best benzo ever.  I suffer from anxiety disorder and occasional panic attack (when anxiety is very high for prolonged periods of time).  Clonazepam turns me into a zombie (good for periods of insomnia though) alprazolam causes me much amnesia and just seems too strong, and lorazepam and Serax just don't last very long requiring multiple doses each day.  I occasionally have my doc switch me around but I always come back to good old Valium.  It just seems to have the best combination of therapeutic action for anxiety and, at 5mg doses, does not turn me into a non functioning zombie or make me sleepy.  Proper use of diazepam has absolutely improved my life overall.  I've been taking 5-10mg a day, a low dose, for 2 years now and would hate to have to give it up.  It is also very non-addictive, and when used appropriately does not have an significant withdrawal symptoms.  For anyone suffering from moderate to severe anxiety, or panic attacks, ask your doctor to let you try simply 5mg of Valium taken in the evening.  Greetings and cheers from a fellow worrywart lol.

I guess it would depend on how many someone is on a day to judge the length of time it would take to clear the system.

I believe exercise and proper diet can help sometimes rather than drugs. I would suggest something NOT addictive like this drug if nothing else.

I take 5-10mg a day usually a couple hours before bed.  It allows me to unwind and relax and stops my mind from racing and wandering.  Have taken for 2 yrs now with no side effects.  It is also easy to stop taking (no withdrawal) but it stays in your system (and is detectable in urine) for a good 3 weeks.  The only caveat is that if you abuse it (take too much) it will lead to depression, so stick to the lowest dose that works.  It is also good for occasional insomnia at higher doses (10-15mg) but stops working for that after only a couple days of use.  Summary: an effective old school 'chill pill' that is safe and easy to use.  P.s. I have used Klonipim and Xanax before and actually prefer the Valium because it lasts longer and doesn't make me tired at the usual 5mg dose.  Cheers!

At first I wasn't sure why but when my Gramother's cancer took a turn for the worse i figured it out. After she passed my sleeping habits got worse and the toll of her death really hit me hard. Everything triggered a memory and I would start crying. My Dr. prescribed this for me for both my sleeping problem and taking the edge off when I thought of her. My Dr. prescirbed 2mg 1-2 tabs 4 times a day. I take 2 at bedtime, 1 in the moring, and normally 2 throughout the day. I sleep like a baby now and I'm not crying all day either. I was kinda scared at first to take it because, as a pharmacy tech, I know the bad things that can happen if you abuse it. This is a great medicine and it can be used for so many different conditions.

I cannot sit or lay down without Severe Chronic Pain. I was FINALLY diagnosed with it this last summer after having it for 11 years. It was caused by a bladder sling put in too tight. I finally got a 2nd opinion and had a doctor try to loosen the sling but it was too late and he knew I had nerve damage just not a name for it at that time. I have to urinate or feel like it constantly and cannot sit without STRONG pain pills and special seating for a SHORT amount of time. It got so bad I could only sleep 1-2 hrs at a time at night for the last 11 years. I would get up in pain, often eat, take meds and finally get back to sleep for 1-2 hrs and then it would happen all over again. Since taking Valium before I go to bed I have slept 5-6 hours at a time, a GOD SEND for me. It relaxes my pelvic muscles enough that I can sleep. I am SO glad it works and hope it works for a long time. I finally got my strong pain meds changed after 11 years because I had built up a tolerance, took them exactly as directed but until the 2nd or 3rd of the day I could not do anything! I was on Lortab 10mg for 11 years and am now on Percocet 7.5 which now brings me the relief the Lortab did YEARS ago. And that relief never takes all the pain away-just the edge off so I can function in short periods of time. I have never felt ""high"" from my pain meds, people in Chronic pain are just trying to get to a more normal existence. I took all test for Pudendal Neuralgia including nerve injections last summer which deadened the nerve for a few hours, trigger point injections etc. So all that diagnosed me with a specialist. There are only 3 surgeons in the U.S. who do a pudendal nerve release operation-there is a 60% chance of recovery and it can take 2-2 1/2 years to see IF it works. I have not opted for that yet! "

408$Condition: Anxious$3/8/2011 1:16:25 PM$Reviewer: LadyOwl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"Valium, aka ""Mommy's lil' helpers"" had been a godsend for me.   I'd been taking it, 10mg tabs, 3x a day, #90/month for 10 years. Now THAT is a miracle as it is. On top of opiate pain meds for chronic back pain as well! All depends on the doctor. Some won't even R/x you an aspirin. 
Well, anyway, since it's so broad, it helped my muscle spasms, GAD, (General Anxiety Disorder) insomnia, migriaines, tension, PTSD, etc. So, that's the good thing about it. 
Bad thing is that after so long, like all the benzodiazapines, you get tolerant to it, and you can take half the bottle, and it doesn't phase you. *NO, I do NOT recommend that, lol)* 
But doc told me after 10+ years (Never asked for an increase in dose ever), the half life is very long, about 3 days. So even though you don't feel it, it's still in your system. So if you pop a Vicodin or something, chances are you're gonna wind up on the floor. That's the downside.
So, as I'm on Methadone 10mg. for chronic back pain, sciatica, Lortab 10mg. for breakthrough pain, (close your mouth, you'll catch a fly), he's decided to cut the Valium, and switch me back to Ativan 1mg. Fine by me, works great, and don't have to worry Doc about the half life. Methadone has a VERY long half life, so I was dancing with death the whole time, and didn't realize it! So, it may be great, but it's a good idea to keep check on your dosage, especially if you're taking opiate painkillers, etc... "

If used right on a as needed only basis you can safely use this Rx. drug for long term uses without too many issues.

463$Condition: Anxious$1/8/2010 1:58:33 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$5$"I've had 2 separate periods of diazepam use. The first was from 1982-99 for generalized anxiety and Meniere's Disease.  It worked very well for both.  However, I am also a recovering alcoholic who has to be careful with drugs like this and when I got sober in 1999, I quit using valium.  Then this past May (2009), I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and my anxiety (and some Meniere's symptoms like vertigo, etc.)came back roaring. I had shortness of breath and a tremendously amplified startle reflex. So, I asked my GP to put me back on low levels of valium, which he did. He also put me on Ambien. My cancer surgery in July was successful and by October, I felt ready to come off both valium and ambien. But my addictive brain (remember, I'm a recovering drunk) wasn't as ready and I was unsuccessful in my own attempt to taper off either drug.  So, I went to the p-doc at the local rehab center and she put me on Remeron and told me to try and get off the ambien first and we'd worry about the valium later.  So, now about 10 weeks later, I'm off ambien completely and am being maintained on 15mg. remeron and 3mg valium a day. This is a sub-clinical valium dose, but it still helps. We're going to stay here for the next 5 months or so and then, if the Remeron continues to work for me, taper the valium until I'm off it.
  Valium has historically been the only drug that has ever given me relief from my anxiety and I've been through a bushel basket of others from Buspar to Luvox to Lexapro. But because of my addictive personality, I need to be off it eventually.
And that's OK so long as the Remeron keeps working.
  So, with some reservations, I'd recommend short-course valium therapy to anybody with severe situational anxiety.  It works.  Watch it though and don't stay on it too long.  It makes all the sharp corners of the world round and while that is a nice feeling, it isn't the way the world really is. Be cautious with this drug, especially if you are prone to addiction."

The times without it, I tried every alternative treatment. And many psychiatrists plus psychologists and social workers. Bottom line, my life is normal when I have it. I am a basket case without it.  I have gone as much as 2 years off it, and those 2 years were hell for me.  I was given every anti-drepressant on the market but none of them took care of my anxiety and I have never had a problem with depression. Some doctors tried them to get me off valium, but they did not work on me. If I were 25, I wouldn't start it again because I know it's addictive, I read things. But at 66, I don't want to live without it after all this time.

I have been told by Roche they are the same. I strongly disagree. If I could afford the name brand, I sure would change back. Valium is much different than the generic, but most disagree.

I was originally prescribed this because of several reasons; TMJ, PTSD, & insomnia. The 2nd night off of the med was when the withdrawl took effect. Over the course of the next 2wks, I felt near death, it was VERY scary. My blodd pressure soared to 158/128, had blurry vision al day, could not sleep for more that 45 mins @ at a time, sick to stomach, trembles, & basicall just felt like dying. While waiting to be seen for a new Dr, a family member provided me with Valium. I found it to be less ""harse"" with the same effcts,& if a miss a night or two, I don't feel much different. My new Dr gives me Ambien 10mg..it works O.K. for about 2 hrs then I wake up @ least 4 other times for a minute or two, just to toss & turn. To sum up my experience w/Xanax, Valium, & Ambien...Xanax is great if you have it but dangerous if you do not. Ambien wks just not long enough. Valium is the best by far. Relief without anyside effects.

My only qualm is that I am physically dependent on the benzodiazepine, but I don't experience withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose because of the long half-life.  

I started out on Xanax back in the 1990s, and it had the opposite effect.  I asked my PCP if I could switch from 4 mg Xanax to 40 mg Valium each day.  He said okay.  Unfortunately, Xanax and Valium are not pharmacologic substitutes.  Forty-eight hours later, I developed seizures.  It was the scariest experience of my life."

How could I be so deceived by that shrink and not listen to school-medicine doctors!! Well an analysis-shrink colleague of him also having a radio show - praising the analysis - admitted in a book after his retirement that he had taken, wait ...Valium over all the years to manage his anxiety !!!!! (strong to do that) Well we know priests preaching A but doing P !!! I'm amazed when people now can report themselves, to see how great help this medicine is and how very, very few have any problems. Of course as chronic anxiety disorder is CHRONIC ... the anxiety will reappear when you stop the medication. The blood-sugar would certainly go up if stopped insulin !!!!

Redheadgirl please see if your anemic, it could be whats wrong. 2. Valium helps with withdrawel from prednisone and other medications that someone may be dropping off of. Also helps when swithching from one longterm medication to another.  helps only mildly with anxiety in my case.

603$Condition: Other$10/28/2007 11:32:50 AM$Reviewer: redheadgurl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$1$5$I have been put on this medicadtion (2.5 mg 3x day) to help me with dizziness. No Doctor can figure out what is causing me to be dizzy, so dizzy that some days I cant walk, other days I fall over backwards down stairs.  But this med helps me be functional! So I am thankful it exists but I want someone to tell me what is wrong with me and not treat me me meds!
