He said this is like seroquel on high. He told me to take this with Benadryl. I was really confused by this, but I did it anyways. First night was great fell asleep in 15 minutes. I didn’t like my whole mouth going numb though. I woke up the next morning feeling great. I didn’t feel tired or drugged out for the first time in a long time. I didn’t take a nap all day either. The next night I tried taking it without the Benadryl, and things didn’t go well. I didn’t get sleepy at all and I waited an hour. Then I went ahead and took the Benadryl and went to bed. The next day I still felt good. A on going problem I started having was my hands and feet would start to go numb out of nowhere. It would like 15 to 30 minutes. Then on the 3rd and final day I woke up with the driest mouth ever! I thought I will just drink some water, and I will be good. That was not what happened. I chugged water all day long at work. Nothing helped. It felt like a desert in my mouth. I am no longer taking it. I can’t deal with all that. My doctor gave me something else to help me sleep I pick it up
tomorrow. I am glad to hear that it has worked for a lot of you. "

This has been a miracle drug for me. I currently got left by my fiance' and was having a really hard time with it. I was waking up what seemed a million times a night with panic attacks and just crying, uncontrollably! Now, I take 5mg of black cherry Saphris about 15 minutes before I wanna go to sleep. Within minutes of it dissolves under my tongue and I fall asleep very shorty afterwards . My tongue does go numb but it doesn't last long. Thanks to this pill, I no longer wake up at all! Not until its time to get up. It allows my mind to rest and no more waking up crying. SO THANK YOU SAPHRIS MAKERS! GOD SENT!!!!!!
47$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/23/2013 3:23:17 PM$Reviewer: Bobby64, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$My psychiatrist gave this to me for my depression.  I did not stay on it very long because it gave me an incredibly uncomfortable, disconcerting feeling.  I took it shortly before bed, and it would give me this odd jolt of energy, fidgetiness, and anxiety.  I felt like I had to rush to bed.  I would end up sleeping okay, but that was a very bad feeling.  More importantly, it did not make me feel less depressed or anxious, and I felt tired even after sleeping okay, so I stopped taking it in just a few weeks.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

Within the first few days I reached a scary level of happiness. I began to have racing thoughts, talking fast and being completely irrational. Soon after I began hallucinating that I knew every stranger in a different from school or work all day. I had the cops called on me for having a breakdown over thinking my dead grandmother was still alive to a woman and the ambulance took me to the ER. There I exclaimed to the entire ER  to listen to me because I was Obama (I'm a white girl), had a seizure, risked falling into a coma, and stayed in the psych ward for 2 days when recovered. All because I took Saphris that was prescribed to me. It was terrifying and life altering.

The dr. on duty said it looked like i had mild stroke as well. I'v had seizures in the past maybe 5. Since i was on that med. i had a seizure and maybe a mini stroke. my blood pressure went down as well and dilantin levels were low. now she wanted me to start 80mg of ziprasidone luckily i didnt but was on 60mg for depression. Geodone was also a med she gave me which had side effects. Right now she has me on lamotrigine 25mg. Thats taken once aday in the afternoon. with that also im on Saphris of which helps me sleep but given as mood stablizer. My question is with my health problems. Are these two meds okay to take? Im a diabetic, and take phenytoin to control seizures, and metformin, gemfibrozil, and asprin 325mgs for diabetes. i take oxycodone for fibromyalgia and arthritis every now and then and they are 5mg. Lisinopril 5mg i dont have high blood pressure but they give it to me so i dont have high blood pressure. im kind of afraid now to take new meds. the meds i take for diabetes i havent had any problems. what do you think? I need help because i dont think this psychologist isnt realizing whats happening. she says this all ok. I had side effects to her meds. I dont want to be a statistic to her meds.

It made me extremely sleepy, which was great since I took it at bedtime.  However, I had WILDLY RESTLESS LEGS AND ARMS!!!  The only thing that helped was walking, or because I was so drowsy, stumbling around the house.  I desperately wanted to sleep, but couldn't because of the constant urge to move.  I will NEVER take this medicine again!

It gives a slight tingling of the tongue and bitterness but at this stage I hardly notice it and it passes in less than 20 minutes. It is helping me so much to feel alert, think clearly and sleep easily. Also I have found I eat less and am not as hungry as I was on Abilify and am finally losing weight again which I am really grateful for. I was suffering major depression and anxiety and combine Cymbalta with Saphris for these conditions. I can now honestly say I have no more symptoms of either condition and am truly delighted. It's definitely worth trying especially if you have found other antipsychotics to be a problem.

Unlike Serequel, while it puts me to sleep at night easily, I wake up wide and refreshed with no hang over.

And did I say it doesn't make me hungry after taking it so no weight gain.

I still believe the best anti-depressent is exercise so this supports that 100%.

118$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/5/2011 1:29:32 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$4$Saphris has basically changed my life. I have been suffering with BP II for 22 years (heavy on the depression), and this little, awful-tasting pill has given me hope I've never had. I've been on it for about a year, and it's still working. The only side effect I've had is tiredness. I take it before bed to minimize the effect, but I still wake up very tired. Sometimes it afects my ability to start the day. Still, the benefits greatly outweigh the side effect. My advice....ask for the black cherry flavor only! It's hardly tasty, but 200% better than the taste of the original.

All night I had body aches and couldn't walk when I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. That morning with the nurse came to check my blood pressure I had 2 major seizurs which led to major memory loss and head trauma.

Won’t lie there.   But having tried literally every other drug similar to this in the past 12 years, I am getting the best results I have ever had with any of them.  And it is fairly weight-neutral - nothing a little extra time at the gym and some good food choices won't overcome.  NOTHING like the 40 pounds I put on in 8 weeks with Zyprexa.  Currently, I take 10 mg of Saphris each night with 60 mg of Prozac each morning...and my depression is better than is has been in years (without being manic).

My advice: just put up with the taste for 10 minutes.  It’s not that bad if you do it carefully…and I’d much rather have a bitter taste in my mouth followed by a little temporary numbness than the crazy weight gain I was getting from other atypical antipsychotics I was being prescribed for my treatment resistant depression (which has been argued to be Bipolar II Disorder...but really, what does the specific diagnosis matter?  I was super depressed for a long time...and now I'm not).

Now here’s the catch: my insurance is NOT covering this drug yet.  Luckily my psychiatrist has been giving me samples for like 6 months now.  Hope we can keep this arrangement up until this gets added to my insurance formulary (or we can successfully appeal the insurance company to cover it).  I really don’t want to go back to the way things were before I found this drug.

Every drug works differently for every person.  But if you have tried all the other options, don’t be scared to try this one.  A bitter taste in your mouth is a small price to pay for what might be the right med choice for you.

Oh, and when I started taking the Saphris, I started seeing positive results within my first week of taking it.  I wasn't “cured” overnight or anything like that, but things started getting noticeably easier within the first few days of having this med. 

Good luck, and don’t be scared to try it – it may be the wonder drug for you!  I know it was for me..."

The taste was horrible, it's nearly impossible to wait an entire 10 minutes before drinking something. My entire tongue, lower jaw and throat were numb for at least 20 mins later. I haven't noticed any improvement in my depression.  I actually feel more depressed than usual after taking this medication for over a month. The worst part is by far the taste, followed by the massive weight gain. I have gained 12 lbs. in one month!! The medication caused drowsiness for about an hour, but I still couldn't sleep throughout the night.  Sleep was restless. Not convinced so far, especially for the high cost.

It took forever for the Saphris to dissolve - horrible taste and a burning tongue.  After 1 use, I am ready to stop.  My husbamd tells me to try it again and suggests drinking water to moisten my mouth first.  I told hime to use it on himself.  I'm fed up with all the medicines and the side effects.

214$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$6/14/2010 2:29:22 PM$Reviewer: fngoerge, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$2$Taste is awful, but found eating something real sweet before taking and 10 minutes after helps (you're supposed to not eat anything 10 minutes after and it will be the longest 10 minutes!)  Taking with Paxil and it seems to help some, but dr increased Paxil too, so not sure which one is working on the depression.  I wouldn't say my tongue gets numb - it's like drinking a really hot cup of coffee & burning your tongue, but it only lasts a hour.  Awful taste goes away quick.  I take it at night and it makes me drowsy & helps me sleep, tho I read about people having restless legs with it.  I already have that so not sure, but I feel more rested the next morning so I guess I have the opposite reaction.  We'll see.  Already had weight gain with Abilify and only been on Saphris for 10 days, so not sure about that side affect.  I want to continue and see what happens - maybe it's just the increase in Paxil that helped!

I was prescribed Saphris 2.5mg to boost the effects of my Lexapro 30mg. Within a day of taking my first dose of Saphris, my depression lifted completely and I felt better than I had in years. Unfortunately I developed a Type 1 allergic reaction with wheezing, puffy face and hands, dry skin and mouth, incredible thirst and itching and had to stop Saphris after just a few days. Coming off of Saphris is no picnic. DO NOT drink alcohol while discontining Saphris - I had two glasses of wine one night and was so suicidal I almost drove to the hospital. Two days later, I am having vivid nightmares and ""exploding head"" sensations and I still feel fragile and confused. I'm taking Claritin D and Pepcid AC to help with the puffiness and itchiness and I am still not comfortable. Can't wait to get this med out of my system."

This was among the most terrifying experiences of my life.  My doctor gave me sample to try to handle general depressing.  The side effects took 3 to 4 months to kick in and no benefit meanwhile.  The side effects were that my vision was so blurry that when I went to an optomitrist to she couldn't believe how fast my vision was detriorating as by the time the glasses were ready, they had to be redone. She asked if I was on any new medications and this was when I finally figured it out. It left me with permanent eye sight damage months later!  To compound, it has the effect of your handwriting getting smaller and smaller until you can't write!  Watch out for this stuff as if you're depressed, it could cause you to totally lose your mind when you can't see or write to compound your situation!
