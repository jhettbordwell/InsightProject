13$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$3/24/2019 5:13:24 PM$Reviewer: Kook81, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on about 6 different antidepressants since I was sixteen. My Dad went blind when I was 12 and sadly it chandge my life for the worse. The happy go lucky kid was was wrong and at 12 you are super comfused as to why you are feeling this way, I didnâ??t start taking anything till 16 and have tried so many different ones I had almost given up hope. The only one that sort of helped was Cymbslta. My Doctor added Seroquel to my cymbalta and it is a total game changer. Iâ??m 24 and finally have found the right thing to me. The only side effect Iâ??ve had is being constantly been hungry. But I think I can muster enough will power to combat that. Seroquel works great for me but someone else it might not. Everyone processes meds differently and unfortunately there isnâ??t one drug that helps all. But if youâ??re like I was and felt completely defeated I say give Seroquel a chance. Itâ??s been 8 years and Iâ??ve found something that truly helps.

20$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$11/7/2018 10:43:55 PM$Reviewer: Carousel_Ambra, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$For five hellish days, I took 50 mgs/day as prescribed. I'd had surgery for medication resistant epilepsy three months prior, and was prescribed this in anticipation of bouts of depression I was expected to experience in addition to the GAD I'd had since childhood. I don't remember any actual events of those five days, just that I was never fully awake, everything had a dark cloud over it, and I wasn't able to walk. Luckily, I was able to use two weeks' vacation time while I was in the hospital, then recovering at home.
21$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/7/2018 3:28:32 PM$Reviewer: Libramoon, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I have Major Depressive disorder and severe anxiety and have a very hard time sleeping. My doctor prescribed this medication to help me go to sleep. Instead of making me sleepy, it gave me bad severe restless body, which kept me up 4 additional hours. When I did finally fall asleep, I had one if the most severe vivid dreams of my life. I woke up in hysterics and it took a while for me to settle down. Im sure its an excellent medication for most. This is just my experience with it.
27$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/6/2018 12:03:22 PM$Reviewer: Through the Storm, 25-34 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$1$4$I was prescribed Seroquel as a mood stabilizer in addition to my antidepressant and antianxiety medicine.  I had A LOT of weight gain.  I was on Seroquel for about 5.5 years.  Before I took Seroquel I weighed around 155 lbs.  While I was on Seroquel, I maxed out at 242 lbs, which lead to me being prediabetic and having to take Metformin.  Determined to lose weight, I had to see a psychiatrist to get off of Seroquel because my primary care physician did not feel comfortable getting me off Seroquel herself.  After a long wait, the psychiatrist tapered me down.  During the tapering process and after I was off of Seroquel, I experienced SEVERE ITCHING ALL OVER MY BODY that lasted about A MONTH.  The itching was everyday at ra don times throughout the day.  The itching from getting off of Seroquel interfered with my ability to concentrate on work or school.  I found that when I was busy, the itching was less severe.  During down time, I would play video games to distract me from the itching, but that stopped working after a while.  Taking showers intensified the itching.  One time I wrapped myself in cold, wet towels which made the itching less intense.  After about 1 month, the terrible itching stopped.  It got off of a Seroquel in September 2017.  It is now April 2018 and I am happy and blessed to say I no longer itch, and I weigh about 184 lb.  I hope this post helps others struggling with weight gain on Seroquel or itching after getting off of Seroquel.

Sure, I sleep better at night but idt it's a good trade off. I'd rather take a sleeping pill than continue to gain weight. My Effexor and Topamax manage my depression for the most part.

It disturbs my head especially  if I turn my head or move suddenly. Very weird. Don't know how to describe it, but have noticed these types of symptoms going off Paxil, but in a lesser way. Seroquel scares me. "

After taking this at bedtime I had many weird dream and woke up with a hangover feeling and it took me most of the morning to shake off this feeling.

66$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/30/2016 1:55:22 AM$Reviewer: Oceans12, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been treated mostly for major depressive disorder for about 10 years. I have really low lows and it doesn't take much to get me there, which of course has always caused tons of sleeping issues. I was prescribed 25mg Seroquel in addition to my long established 20mg Prozac. I'm very happy with it for sleeping and as a boost for my antidepressant. In the past, I have tried Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Xanax (for sleep) and (unfortunately) Effexor. For a while, I went up to 50mg Seroquel but I had noticeably disturbing dreams. Based on the reviews I've seen here, I think most people are taking too high of a dose. This is definitely a drug I would start low and see it's effect for a 3-6mo period. I also take Ativan occasionally for anxiety but overall the low level Seroquel has very much improved my condition. I have control of when I go to sleep and I sleep well, waking up feeling like I actually rested. Being sleepy comes quickly and deep within 30 mins of taking it but I think it's appropriate. I have never slept through my kids needing me at night so the depth or need for sleep must taper off.  Having a handle on my emotions and specifically on my sleep has helped me be significantly more functional.  I look forward to staying on it for a long time.

71$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$2/23/2016 5:48:02 PM$Reviewer: Daisy14, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$All medications work differently for everyone. I get great benefit from this medication. I was having huge highs and lows. Now I would say I am balanced. Still happy and sad but no more outrageous outbursts and tears. I do miss my overly happy moments but you have to give a little to get results. I do have dry mouth and I get hungry more frequently. As for sleeping, I don't sleep through the night anyway. I take Ambien also but I am still restless during my sleep. Overall taking Seroquel has helped and I will continue to take it. Please try it for yourself before you pass judgement from someone elses experience.

I was a 5'1"" 115# female. My weight is very important to me. I've worked out the majority of my life. But when I ended up in a hospital for suicidal thoughts, I really didn't even care, think or wonder what this med would do to me. It made me feel better. I worked up to 300mg in a short time (May-September). I have gained enough weight (30 pounds) to make it impossible for me to fit into my clothes. I thought I'll just stop taking it. After 2 nights very bad withdrawal symptoms. I am still going to get off this med but I'm going to wean myself off. I am also a LUPUS patient. I had no idea that this med was making my LUPUS symptoms worse. I realized during those 2 days I did not take the medication. My lupus symptoms decreased.  This CANNOT BE A GOOD MEDICATION. IT LITERALLY MADE ME SUFFER SO MUCH MORE WITH MY LUPUS!! I do not care if my doctor approves or not, I will NOT continue this med, but I will be more careful taking myself off of it."

Seroquel is effective as a when I have self-harm impulses that are too strong for me to control. Although it is effective, I hate how it makes me feel. It sure beats waking up in a medical hospital with my husband holding my hand after being in a coma for 4 days from Wellbutrin overdose or the shame of being on a first name basis with most of the ER staff because the have had to stich up my cuts on my wrists and neck. I take alot of medications and have since childhood, but my life is different now with a very loving and supportive husband, college diplomas and even a black belt in judo and 2 world champion bronze medals! 5 or 6 years ago if someone would have said I would have laughed in their face. Yes, I hate Seroquel but it does work where none of the other medications I have tried (and I have, over the years,  have probably tried most) It, with the other medications I take is much better than the mental health hospitals that I have practically grown up in over the years. So as much as I dislike Seroquel and my other medications as well, the benifits far outwiegh my displeasure with the side effects and I'm willing to continue with it and consider it as a very small price for the life I now have.

It eased my symptoms and allowed me to fall asleep rapidly, which I badly needed. However, I gained about 30 pounds and had almost insatiable hunger. When my blood sugar levels started to rise, my internist advised me to stop taking it. Fortunately, my psychiatrist agreed. I've had a difficult time losing the weight and now have fatty liver disease from the rapid weight gain. The drug helped when I needed it, but I wouldn't stay on it for any longer than necessary. Do your homework on this medication, and be sure to have regular blood work done.

At first it was a medication for severe psychotic disorders. Now it seems to be used as a catch-all for any type of depression or 
behavior problems. Even a small dosage can have lasting side effects, especially uncontrolled body movements and tics in different parts of your body that may or may not go away. My first experience with it caused my neck to move involuntarily in stiff movements. My next doctor ignored my reaction and gave me a low dosage of this drug. The first night after taking it, I couldn't walk straight; the second night my knee started to click when I walked; the third night my ankles started to click; the last night my neck started to crick or pop every time I moved it. That was the last night I took it and it took a year for my neck to stop clicking when I moved it. Even after that, my doctor ordered refills for me. I didn't take them and stopped seeing that doctor. I think you really need to be careful and if a medication is causing you unusual reactions, stop taking it and tell your doctor. If he won't listen, stop taking the medication and find another doctor who will listen to you and work with you to fing a medication that will help you instead of turning a psychotic medication for a non-psychotic condition."

I took it for 3 weeks and it's been 3 months now that I've been off of the Seroquel 25mg and I still have mild tinnitus but is is much better.  I just want to warn people that if you do experience tinnitus to get off this med. right away. I don't know if the tinnitus will ever fully go away but I did test it and went back on the Seroquel for 3 days and the tinnitus got unbearable in just 3 days!  Now I'm on Abilify and it seems to be working almost as well as the Seroquel without any side-effects.

504$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$12/5/2011 1:20:07 PM$Reviewer: schtinky, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$WARNING:  Do not let your doctor talk you into taking this medicine while you are on any anxiety medication like xanax or ativan.  I had a SEVERE and scary reaction to the combination of Serequel and Ativan - I blacked out in a fugue and had a psychotic episode.  I remember nothing of it but both my mother and husband witnessed abnormal behavior such as flushing all my medication, putting turkey salad in a bowl and pouring milk on it like cereal, and thinking my socks were a chocolate bar.  This side effect isn't included in the 'interactions' portion but there is a caution regarding use of anxiety medication.  Seroquel is DANGEROUS.  I could have seriously injured myself, and its frightening to not remember a thing you did or said while others tell you that you were acting psychotic.  Ask for another medication such as risperidone that isn't as dangerous as Seroquel.

I thad been years since I'd be able to sleep, or really function in a day to day environment for much more than an hour or two. When my psyche team suggested this drug we talked it over, and I could hear only one downside, and that was the drive to feed within an hour or two after taking the dosage. We started out on a low dosage and worked up and I take it about 2030 and then about an hour later I eat an apple with a piece of cheese, and that pretty much kills the craving to eat everything in site.  I have been on a Seroquel 300XR for about 1 1/2 years now and I sleep like a baby and except for something to shut my mind down it works great. The panic attacks are controlled by other stuff, and I take another anti-depressant, plus topirimate for cluster headaches and it also seems to help with the BPD.  Only downside is the cost with crappy insurance my copay for 90 days is $180.00.  I wish the manufactuer would help us out."

664$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/26/2011 8:40:23 PM$Reviewer: Bostonbadbeans, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$2$"I took this medication to deal with severe anxiety and depression when my doctor/psychiatrist felt I might be a bit manic--he decided later I was not but also it is recommended as an adjunt for depression which is really bad idaa.
I gained 30 pounds in one month and could never ever get the weight back off! It gave me diabetes and almost sent me into a diabetic coma within 2 months on it. And I was only taking like 100 mg a day-the therapeutic dose for bipolar patients is 500 mg day. I do not know if a person in their 20s could take this but diabets is such a severe side effect that if it occurs with weight gain it is not woth any benefits unless you are absolutely so bipolar you are a risk to yourself and of harming others and even then this and all meds in its class are so toxic I have to wonder why the FDA would approve it--its not a terminal condition to be bipolar..and there are alternatives far safer. It also makes you so out of it its like being on methadone or heroine--its like a narcotic-i think addictive nad sedating the crap out of patients who are manic is not a solution with these side effects. Awful drug, should be banned.

I then developed nausea and couldn't eat or drink.  I lost 15 lbs. in two weeks.  I went to the ER three times and each time they changed my anxiety meds.  I ended up knowing I had to try something else.  I am a nurse and I called our mental health facility.  They told me to come in and after an extensive interview, I was admitted for four days.  They stopped my meds and put me back on Effexor, but Klonopin for anxiety and added Seroquel 100mg.  The first night after I took it and went to bed, I felt a burning in my shoulders.  This is often related to my anxiety episodes so I figured the new meds weren't going to work.  Next thing I knew I felt this wonderful peace come over me and I slept like a baby.  After three days the nurses said,""You're feeling better, aren't you""?  And I sure was.  I took Seroquel for about a year and added talk therapy.  I did gain 20 lbs. but I had a quiet mind, didn't stress, and my life got back on track.  I eventually was able to go off of the Seroquel.  "

I have been on Effexor for five years, which began with 75 mg. was increased to 150 mg, and then to 225 mg. before beginning the Seroquel. Once I started this one, the Effexor was bumped up to 300 mg. Since beginning this high dose combination, I have gained 26 lbs., began chewing the skin on my fingers (nervousness), have vivid nightmares, constant sweating, dizzy spells, loss of memory, itchiness, sleepiness, losing my chain-of-thought in the middle of a sentence, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. On one occasion, I passed out in the bathroom, and woke up in a fog – wondering how and why I was in the floor. While the severity of the depression, anxiety (and muscular pain from Fibromyalgia) has lessened, I continue to have little interest in getting out of bed, leaving home, interacting with others, and driving. In the past, I have tried other medications for depression (e.g., Prozac, Celexa, and Cymbalta), and did not have as many issues. I took Prozac for about six years and only experienced talking excessively. With the Celexa and Cymbalta, I experienced insomnia and continued having episodes of depression and anxiety, but not as severe as I had when I did not take any medication. With the symptoms I am having with this current combination, I am not sure which medications will work for me, but I plan to consult my doctor about a few of the medications some of you mentioned (i.e., Abilify, Remeron, and Lamictil). Also, I have a prosthetic heart valve and the last thing I need is an increase in the symptoms I am having with the Seroquel!!

I am 5'3 and that is a lot of weight for me to lug along.  All my joints are killing me from the weight gain.

My easting habits have gotten very peculiar.  I eat really only one sit down actual meal per day and then I spend the rest of the day eating frozen blueberries, fat free frozen yogurt, and popcorn until I am sick!!!

I fear I will have to give up the mental sanity that I have finally found because the weight is unhealthy and causing me such a self esteem problem that I can't really leave my house for fear of seeing someone I know!!

Anyone out the have any comments or advice?"

959$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$6/4/2010 11:57:22 PM$Reviewer: Ingalls007, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$My Dr prescribed Seroquel for depression. I took my first dosage in the morning before work. At work, I became very dizzy and hoped that it would subside. I completely fell out-fainted but did not lose consciousness after feeling dizzy. Then I started suffering from rapid heartbeat and my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest. The Medic was so scared for me-as soon as he listened to my heart he said you are going to the hospital I do not like the sound of your heart. If that wasn't scary enough I became convinced I was going to die panicked in the ambulance begging this medic to not let me die as I had never felt my heart do the things it was doing. I was put on a EKG and given charcoal solution to drink I guess to soak up rest of drug in my system. That was only on 1 pill-100mg-I basically overdosed on the medicine that I was prescribed. It was the most awful experience of my life. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone.

I m on 200 mg at night with 3 mg of Xanax. My Dr.s tried everything and I suffered for 3 yrs until they put me on Seroquel. It started to work for me in 2 days. But, I was only on 50mg and now Im up to 200mg. It truely saved my life. I was to the point that I was going to kill myself. I would go days without sleeping and wouldn't answer the phone, go to work. I just increased my Xanax last night and Im going to reduce my Seroquel down to 100 mg tonight. I need to reduce the amount of meds I take at night because it takes me over 2 hours in the morning just to get out of the fog Im in. I don't know if its addictive like the Xanax. I hope its not. I can't sleep without the Xanax, and I know Im addicted to them. But my life is SO much better now that I don't care if Im addicted

I've only been taking the drug for a week now (about 5 tablets a day) and I've already noticed severe side-effect reactions, one of the scariest being uncontrollable muscle spasms, twitches, and general restlessness (CAUTION: These abnormal muscle movements can become permanent if Seroquel is not stopped quickly!). 

I've also noticed/experienced a constant need to move my legs (restless leg syndrome), shakiness in my movements and voice, dry-mouth, increased temperature/fever immediately after taking, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), mental/mood changes (e.g., increased anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts).

PLEASE, SERIOUSLY SPEND SOME TIME CONSIDERING THESE SIDE EFFECTS I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE. 

From what I have read, some of these side effects can even be PERMANENT. I hope a week wasn't enough time to have irreversibly damaged my system.

nerve damage in my lower bsck and neck.  An

this medication.  He said that besides helping depression, it can also help some for pain.  Since I have been taking it only at night time, it has helped me to rest better, helps with my depression and nervousness.  At first I thought he was a little crazy if he thought this was going to help me since it is more of a mental disorder medication, but after giving it more time, I did notice that it was indeed helping me quite abit with my different problems including my chronic pain.  So, now I continue to take it and I realize that this elderly doctor did know what he was talking about after all."

The doctor switched me to trazodone a few days ago.  I was supposed to slowly drop the dosage down to get off it.  I disagreed with the doctor because I love the medication and decided to cold turkey it.  I stayed very sick for a few days and its messing with my physically.  This isnt ideal but I HAVE to get off it because of my diabetes managment.  Overall, this is an awsome drug I could even ignore the weight gain if it werent for the diabetes.

Though i have recently heard that it possibly increases  risk of adult diabetes... hopefully I find it is minimal and I can continue to make progress in finding happiness in life.

Certainly the meds do not MAKE us happy, 
they were very difficult for me to ""swallow"" when I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety.  I refused to think I needed to take pill to be happy.  Of course I have learned, they don't create the contentment, but they help us to balance our chemistry to combat the symptoms.  

We are all different, and many times the first medications prescribed don't achieve the proper results or even worsen what you are dealing with in the first place.  

Dealing with depression on some level for over 15 years myself, I've been through all kinds of presciptions... and just in the past couple years found a combo that is finally effective for me. 

So if you find the meds you are taking now aren't quite right or simply dont work... keep trying.  It will be very frustrating.

Seroquel, along with Lamictal and Lexapro, has helped me to better deal with my depression, anxiety as well as other issues... more effectively than the many other med combination I have tried.  

I hope this can help at least one person out there!"

It worked great at helping me sleep but being on one pill made me have demonic and horrifying nightmares so she uped the dose and it worked like a charm. Great sleep but if you could not get 7-8 hours it left you groggy and almost feeling hungover so you definatly need to get a full nights rest on this or I would skip it so you dont feel worn down.

And my sleep cycle is backwards - awake all night and sleep all day. These meds have been wonderful but my continuing depression had escalated sleep disorders and the remaining depression from which I could not dig myself out despite the addition of a full spectrum light box I felt I needed something else if it were available.  Seroquel 50-150mg has done the trick for me for my lingering bi-polar & clinical depression.  All 3 meds + my light box have worked wonders for my 'dark night of the soul' and for my insomnia types.  Now I'm hoping to get my sleep hygiene back on track & wake up w/ a better outlook for the day. Or at least an outlook that is realistic. I'm also a Type II diabetic, controlled by diet & exercise & I have found that Seroquel does, in fact, raise my blood sugar.  My FBS ranges are now 109-118, but my 2hr post prandial sugars are in my range of 120-135. Hope this is helpful.

1895$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/26/2008 4:27:08 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$2$This medication has been quite effective in treating my depression and anxiety. One of the side-effects was unbearable when I first started it. Excessive tiredness, dizziness, and forgetfulness resulted from larger doses (300-400mg). I gave up on the medicaiton at first, but then I recently started to split the pills into 100 mg pieces and am taking them throughout the day. I can now handle the lower level of tiredness and I can actually stay awake and more alert, although I am also occasionally left to drinking caffenated drinks to help with my energey level.  Extreme tiredness(zombie-effect) appears to be a common side-effect. To combat this I suggest trying smaller doses and taking them throughout the day instead of once a day. In the two months since being on this I have seemed to have just recently built up a bit of a tolerance, thus the zombie-effect has lessened.  I have also gained 3-4 pounds  since starting this medication.  I seem to be hungry more often.  Watch out for this as well and try to start or continue exercising. I do get some other side-effects, however they are minor in comparison to the ones listed above.

All this guy would do was dope me up on different meds, but he was most successful when he prescribed me the seroquel.  I only weigh 102 lbs but instead of starting on low dosage I prescribed on a 100mg pill.  I was suppose to take it every morning with other medication.  I could not remember the day, I would pass out, in class, driving.  I try taking only 50mg but my day still had felt surreal. Eventually I decided to use it as a sleeping pill, it worked, but i never got up.  Or when I did get up I felt as though I was suffering from a hangover.

I would be up all night and sleep in the day. I guess you could say I was nocturnal. I had pretty much dealt with that for years, though. I was diagnosed Bipolar without the extreme manic episodes. This medicine is not bad, I had no problems except sleepiness, and extreme hunger. This is technically an anti-phychotic drug, but popular and used quite frequently. I would suggest starting out on a very small dose, say 25 mg. & work up from there. I was taking 300 mg a day, but then stopped the medicine for a while, and now use occasionally at night. 25 mg knocks me out now. You do get used to it in higher doses if you up your mgs slowly and take it everyday. But, beware of the side effect of hunger because if it's not nailed down YOU WILL EAT IT!

This resulted in my placement in the psychiatric ward, where the doctors switched my meds from Zoloft 200mg per day at night to Seroquil 600mg per day, 200mg in morning and 400mg at night. I understand that they did this in order to stabilize me and help me get to sleep (I was finding it difficult to go to sleep at night). Immediately I noticed a change in my mood. I no longer could feel any of my normal emotions and all I could feel were a powerful feelings of paranoia and fear. My OCD symptoms became worse. I am sure this is connected to the psychotic break. I became numb to all feelings of happiness, sadness, anger... All I could feel were loneliness, shame, and fear. Additionally, I lost the ability to dream (I would pass out promptly after taking Seroquil and wake up in the morning, having felt asleep for only about a minute). After the psych ward I was transported to a residential care facility, and over the course of 3 months I was able to reduce my dosage from 600mg to only 100mg in the evening. Through tapering off Seroquil, I have been able to feel almost my full range of emotions again and I have felt comfortable expressing them. Peers and doctors were able to notice a marked difference in my mood, demeanor, sleep patterns, interaction with others, self-esteem, etc. The last change in my dosage (from 200mg to 100mg) was almost 8 months ago, and the new psychiatrist I have been seeing (not the psychiatrist from the residential care unit) has been resistant to the possibility of tapering off my Seroquil completely. I am looking forward to working with a future psychiatrist and future therapist in order to slowly wean myself off Seroquil completely.

2622$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$6/7/2014 3:19:58 PM$Reviewer: humancondition, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$4$4$"My main uses for SQ are for nervous agitation, depression and anxiety, combined with Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I switched from regular, immediate release Seroquel (I'll abbreviate it SQ) after several years to Seroquel XR (SQXR) because I'd been decreasing the dose gradually over the course of about a year from 600 to 200 mg a day, and the doctor suggested I take regular SQ once a day. At that point, I was taking 200 mg at night, 50 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the afternoon. I was leery of suddenly switching to 300 mg regular SQ once a day at bedtime because I was afraid the effects wouldn't last throughout the day, so I switched to XR instead of regular SQ. The first night I took SQXR I thought I felt nauseous the next day, but that was the only time. I quickly & easily adjusted to a single dose of SQXR at bedtime, with no problems. It continued to work all day, but I no longer had the sleepiness or slightly ""loopy"" feeling I used to get from taking the immediate release drug during the day. This is a significant benefit. In general, side effects from SQXR are less than from regular SQ, and I hear this is the case for many patients. (Be warned: your insurance company may charge you a lot more to get the XR version. Currently XR is not available in generic. If you don't have insurance, you'll pay more than an arm and a leg for SQXR. Even worse, my insurance company had to get special approval from my doctor and put me through a lot of rigamarole to get XR because it was a ""special"" or non-formulary medication.) After several months on XR and working down to 200 mg/day, I've now switched back to regular SQ (to save money, mainly), 150 mg once at day at bedtime. I used to take XR at 10:30 and sometimes wouldn't get to sleep until 2 am. Now I take regular SQ and fall asleep by 12 am. I haven't had any trouble switching to regular generic SQ 1/day. XR has fewer side effects, takes longer to work, costs more. If you want to take XR, you'll probly adjust easily to it."

Not a good experience. Tiredness would begin to kick in after an hour.  Slept fine but wouldn't want to physically or psychologically get up in the morning.  Unmotivated upon waking, bad mood, irritable.  Felt better as the day progressed because the Seroquel was getting out of my system.  I know you're supposed to take it for several days until any anxiety relief kicks in and a few weeks until depression relief kicks in but I couldn't make it.  The drowsiness and crabbiness wasn't worth fighting through for that long to see if it would have even worked anyway.

I read that other people's dreams have improved, but I have vivid NIGHTMARES more than 9 times out of 10.

That is how the head of the ward at the Rockyview hospital works. He gets someone else to do the diagnosis then over doses on meds. I also had severe PTSD over a home burning down and then 6 months later losing my job and the house I had purchased and everything I owned. This was not considered important and not addressed. So, the value of this med to me is based on major misdiagnosis. I had no remission of depression and no help with sleeping. I not only had no help with depression it got worse. I could not move my neck anymore. I was told this did not matter. I could no longer reason well and, as a Systems Analyst, it was critical that I be able to think. This did not matter either. I was taken off Seroquel cold turkey and thought I was going to die though this had happened with Effexor too.
I believe we are all guinea pigs. I trust my GP more to know what is going on but I have to have a psychiatrist to get my paperwork done for early retirement and nothing to show for a life of hard work. "

2896$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$8/25/2008 12:13:35 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I have been taking Seroquel for about a year.  400mg at bedtime.  My doctor recently added Seroquel XL (300 mg) to my reqular Seroquel dose.  Although Seroquel has been the best anti-depressant for me so far, I find myself stuttering.  Has anyone else experienced this as a side-effect?
