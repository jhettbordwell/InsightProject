5$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/25/2019 10:01:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Took 5mg as prescribed finally one day to see if it would help me, made me feel anxious/restless and slightly euphoric but also gave me headaches and made it hard to gather thoughts clearly. Woke up the next day after and was still feeling the effect, the drug stays working in your system for more then a day. I discontinued use after that experience, take caution if you're considering taking it as this medication doesn't work for everyone.

Some of them are very worrisome to me!
17$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/20/2018 8:59:45 AM$Reviewer: JamesW, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$3$I have taken other SSRIs before and SNRIs. For me, I felt an effect within a few hours. It comes on as very jittery and with the jaw clenching, very similar to SNRIs like Effexor. I've never had another SSRI react this way. It helps, I just hope the side effects get better.

My best example is on Christmas Eve, I dropped a bottle of soda coming out of the fridge and it exploded all over the kitchen.  I literally laughed even though I knew my company coming over were on their way.  I said, ""the old Michelle would have threw a fit, and Christmas Eve would have been ruined!""  The new Michelle just laughed it off.  I don't sweat the small stuff and I feel more rational, and feel like my old self again.  I have been on this medication for 6 months now, 10 mg."

26$Anxiousness associated with Depression$10/30/2017 4:07:02 PM$Reviewer: alex, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$"TL;DR; I was prescribed 10mg daily of this medication to counteract moderate anxiety. But it has helped with panic attacks as well. It was effective almost from day one and I recommend it to others.

The Bad: I got nausea the first 2 days, headaches for about a week, soft stools for about 3 weeks and a small loss in libido. 

The Good: I noticed a real difference within days of taking the medication. I'm skeptical that it was a placebo effect because they say it shouldn't have full effect till 2-4 weeks, however, I don't care and I'll take what I can get even if it was a placebo effect. I used to have panic attacks, and general anxiety to many things. I'd hold to things for days and I'd generally be down, even though I was convinced what I had was just a ""regular amount of stress"". Right away, I noticed I didn't have rash and abrupt reactions to things, things rolled off me a lot easier and I approached everything in life more calmly. I've had more focus at work, I'm able to concentrate better and I'm more engaged with family and my kids. "

I start taking this medication due to drug abuse and depression. I´ve been on it for 2 weeks now, and the side effects have been awful. I sweat a lot, I have terrible migraines, I feel drowsy and it´s very hard to concentrate. I´m hoping the side effects will diminish over time. The good news, I have not been smoking weed since I started the medication, so yay me. If you´re about to take this medication, please review the side effects and precautions. Hopefully, this will work for me 
57$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/30/2015 8:33:13 PM$Reviewer: Selita, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$In my experience Lexapro is the only medication that has helped me manage depression, panic disorder and BMT Migraines.  Prior, I've been on a number of widely prescribed medication to treat those conditions without seeing any benefits and having my symptoms worsen. Once I started on Lexapro, panic attacks have completely stopped within two months.  Depression has become manageable and almost completely gone in about 6 months.  Added benefit in my case - BMT migraines that I've suffered from for almost 6 years have subsided to the point where I only have to watch my diet.  Occasional episodes are now easily treated with Advil.  I've been able to resume normal life after only 3 months of being on Lexapro. Warning: in my case this drug definitely has caused long term sexual dysfunction. I was able to recover, to a point. As long as I am on this drug, I don't expect to have normal, healthy sexual drive. Also, I'd warn about switching from brand name to generic escitalopram. In my case, it caused quick return of debilitating mood changes.  I have to take twice the dose of escitalopram to get the benefit of single dose of Lexapro.

I've taking for almost two years, and occasionally I forget to take it for a day or two. Almost inevitably, the chatter inside my head begins to belittle me or a sense of dread creeps back in. That's when I realize i've forgotten my dose. It has helped alleviate the nagging, underlying sense of defeat and unworthiness, without giving me any sense of a ""high."" I like the neutral feeling it provides. I don't feel any side effects. Also seems to help with perimenopause. I don't feel like crying all the time anymore."

184$Anxiousness associated with Depression$10/15/2019 3:53:35 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My doctor prescribed this due to my concern over constantly crying over stressful situations (due to anxiety and major depression) and it was happening on a daily basis. It was so bad that I couldn't work. The Lexapro really helped rather quickly. I'd say within a week or two I started noticing changes. I still think the same but I can brush things off that normally would make me cry. I pretty much feel like I things don't bother me as severely as they did. Sure, I still get sad and feel down at times, but they don't make me feel like it's the end of the world and I don't cry whenever I feel stressed.

About 4 months into taking it, I became even more depressed then I have ever been. I would cry every single day and nothing in my life at the time was a result of my overwhelming emotions. Once I realized this wasnâ??t normally me, I went back to the doctor. They changed my dosage. I was feeling good for a while but now Iâ??m just as anxious as I was before the medication and having panic attacks again, and I donâ??t feel like myself. This medication has made me even more depressed then Iâ??ve ever been in my life, and itâ??s almost like Iâ??ve adjusted and am feeling just as anxious. Iâ??ve talked with many others that have taken lexapro and they also werenâ??t satisfied with the effects of the drug. They didnâ??t have my exact experience but similar ones. If you take this drug, I suggest really checking in with yourself to make sure youâ??re feeling better and not worse.

208$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/13/2018 5:42:02 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have had anxiety off and on for years, but it was always controllable. However, it became more and more progressive over the past few months where my anxiety would trigger full blown panic attacks. One day, I woke up feeling extremely anxious and it did not go away all day. The anxiety progressed so fast where I had episodes of trembling throughout the day, completely lost my appetite, and would even wake up in the middle of the night with extreme anxiety. the anxiety took over and It was all I could think about. It became so debilitating, just trying to go to the store was the hardest task in the world and I was terrified to do so. My anxiety triggered deep depression. I am usually very full of energy, work out, and happy. I have a full time job, and two young kids so I knew I had to see a doctor and get things figured out. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression. I am not one to take medicine and am usually scared to do so, but anything was worth a try at this point. I was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro and within a week, felt a difference. It has been 2.5 weeks now, and I feel like myself again and like I have my life back. The medicine helped with my anxiety first, so I still felt my depression until about the second week. I personally haven't experienced any crazy side effects yet, and feel a headache or a little weight gain (if that does happen) is way better than the extreme anxiety and depression I was battling. My Dr.'s goal is to slowly lower my dose after a few months until I am good to be completely off it, as she believes my diagnosis is situational. This medicine truly saved me and gave me my life back. You just have to stick with it!

I have been taking generic for about 2 1/2 weeks. I have been very sleepy, was dizzy for the first week or so and have excessive sweating.

I noticed immediate side effects of extreme drowsiness, feeling wound up like I had drank 10 cups of coffee, on edge, in a fog, couldnt orgasm and felt an over all numbing and didnt feel like myself. 

I emailed my doctor and said I couldnt take it anymore. The side effects were driving me insane. She recommended I stop taking it and am waiting to be prescribed with a replacement. 

My partner is on the same med and same dose and he doesnt seem to be having the negative side effects like I am. "

Walking across the floor and having my bladder open up with no warning. I felt zombie like. Couldnâ??t cry. Felt dead inside. In a way, that was acceptable to me, until my Mom died and I felt nothing. Got off after a long withdrawal period. Whoever said this isnâ??t addictive is crazy. Iâ??ve been on several and prozac was the only one I was able to just stop taking. As a matter of fact, I used prozac to finally get me thru this withdrawal and then just stopped prozac. After I got off this medication. I stopped peeing all over the place. Weird.

I finally feel like I have a reason to live again and I'm actually able to enjoy social situations. Had many side effects first week including extreme irritability but all have subsided. Sexually side effects have benefited me and can now get my partner off multiple times and really concentrate on the act of pleasing rather than trying to last lol.

I was really skeptical about the side effects. I read one very positive review & it changed my mind. I am so glad i started Lexapro two months ago. I was put on Lexapro for anxiety. I was always in a bad mood & everything set me off. I started with 10mg & saw a slight improvement the first week. It wasn't until the Dr put me on 15mg about a month in that i really saw considerable improvement. Two months later i can honestly say I am am so happy to be on this medication. Everything just seems better. I am happy. I find joy in the things i used to. I look forward to social events. My mood is so much better. I did not gain weight. No sexual side affects. Please don't let other peoples experiences deter you. Give it a try!

246$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/21/2017 10:20:47 PM$Reviewer: sommersommer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"My anxiety hit a high in my mid 20s & went from every once in a while to a constant drowning feeling of anxiety. When it became paralyzing, I started therapy. After 4 months of therapy & being against medication, I started to learn more about the illness, how it runs in my family & because the physical symptoms weren't going away I started Lexapro. 
For the first couple of months as I increased the dosage, I became extremely paranoid that I was going to become suicidal. The weird part was that I had never even thought about this before and never experienced symptoms of depression. I started to learn through therapy that it stemmed from my fear of losing control of my anxiety and myself and the worst case scenario of that would be killing myself. 
I then became extremely motivated to become the best version of myself that I could be. With more therapy, daily mental exercises, physical exercise and A LOT of hard work... I was able to shake the paranoid thoughts and have never appreciated life more than I do now. Lexapro helped with the physical symptoms but if you suffer from anxiety and panic disorder you still need therapy. The medication is just one part of the process. But with all of the hard work and a daily pep talk in the mirror, I am a completely different person than I was 1 year ago when I hit rock bottom. 
I see life different & I am so grateful for the little things because I once couldn't enjoy them because of my anxiety and physical sickness. For those who are suffering from anxiety, this is how I see it. Every day I may get a wave here & there but I can manage it and still be happy. If that is the worst thing I have to deal with that day, I will take it. Anxiety is 100% manageable and YOU HAVE CONTROL. It's all about really believing you have control and that YOU ARE NOT A VICTIM. I think it's really important we start more conversations about mental illness. We shouldn't be ashamed or afraid.I encourage all of you to keep preaching ways to overcome it"
249$Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/11/2017 6:44:02 PM$Reviewer: StephG, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$Had anxiety that creep into depression. Finally decided that I needed medication to help. First 2 weeks I had severe sweating, weird sensation in my mouth, spaciness. But they went away after two weeks or so. I still suffer now from increased sweating at night which is annoying... However the positive affect it has had on my life is AMAZING. Within days I started to feel better, clear head, consistent mood, and started to feel happy again. Would definitely recommend it. My husband is on the same drug, it took him sometime to feel the positive effects. So make sure you stick to it for a least 2 months.

I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Dysthymia causing stress induced hallucinations and panic attacks sometimes severe enough to cause suicidal thoughts. The drug started working slowly after the first week and took full effect about a 1.5 months of use. I was very tired on and off for the first 3 weeks of use. Now small things make me happy, I rarely have panic attacks and no hallucinations. I feel normal for the first time in my life. WARNING! When your doctor says to not quit cold turkey they MEAN IT. I went off my meds for a week after 3 months of use and after 3 days without had even worse severe sudden and suicidal panic attacks frequently. DO NOT SUDDENLY QUIT THIS ONCE ON IT. make sure your doctor gives you access to months of this drug as a precaution so you never run out all of a sudden. I have a 5 month at a time prescription now.

Then I was started on 10 mg Lexapro with only one side effect..no sexdrive, but it came back after 1 month. It started working in just 2 days. I was waking up happy...yes happy with not one worry on my mind. Where before Lexapro that was all I could do all day long was worry and think the worst. Now I am happy and it has been 8 weeks. This med has given me my life back better than new and my husband has his wife back and my daughter her mom. I am now focused, busy and social again. Greatful and thankful to God for taking my worrys and bringing me Lexapro. Without God I wouldn't be here right now. Try Lexapro, but also give your worries to God. He can handle them.

Used beside cognitive therapy for the first year, it is effective except for when experiencing major life changes or having a particularly bad day owing to an abnormally severe collection of stressors. When mired in a low or very anxious, recovery time is measured in hours instead of days or weeks like it used to be prior to treatment.

For context, I developed depression and social anxiety issues somewhat over a decade prior to seeking treatment. With the combination of escitalopram and cognitive therapy the amount of progress made in the management of these problems has, frankly, been surprising, exceeding my expectations."

I've taken Lexapro for several years.  I've experienced anxiety for most of my life - not so much depression.  Marriage woes had me at a counselor and she suggested it - just to take the edge off.  I was on just 10mg for a long time, but then a major life event occurred and my Dr. increased my dosage to 20mg.  (I'm 190#).  It works well for me.  No anxiety at all, lets me be happy and experience other emotions.  Some of these meds will reduce your sex drive; Lexapro does not.  I recommend it.

In the last 3 years I have had some negative life events happen that turned me into an emotional rollercoaster. I would be fine one minute then burst into tears for the smallest reason,  get bouts of anger and fall into depressive funk for days at a time,  have melt downs in public,  etc.  My GP prescribed me this medication 3 years ago, escitalopram 10mg, and I have been faithfully taking it ever since. 2-3 weeks after beginning this medication,  I was finally able to get off the rollercoaster and feel more balanced then I've ever felt.  I still have days where I feel no interest in doing anything in life now and then,  but for the most part I feel a normal balance with very few side effects.  I have had stomach issues,  and problems reaching orgasm, but I had these problems since before starting the medication so I don't think that's the medication causing this. Anyway I think this medication has saved my life,  and I am thankful for it.

Those Kinda passed,  it has got better. My doctor upped me to 20mg 3weeks ago and I'm starting to notice a little difference, just not as good as I was expecting to. I still have off/bad days regularly just not as often. I've heard this is a great med but really haven't noticed any major changes in aditude or motivation. Id like to be happy and normal (like all of us) if it doesn't make some major progress soon I think I'll try something else. Kinda like a hot dog that only has ketup and mustard on half. I think it works good for some but probably isn't for everyone.

First week I only noticed a minimal difference but it takes time to take affect. After upping the dose, then I saw a good change. I still worry or stress but it's not overwhelming and I don't go into a weepy, depressed spiral. I also noticed that I don't have that ""I hate my life/I want to die"" mantra in my head. There are side effects: sleepy, tired/listless, disrupted sleep, vivid dreams, dry mouth, constipation/diarrhea and lack of sex drive. The tired/sleepiness I can deal with because I was always tired when I was depressed too. Dry mouth? I drink more water, which is good. No sex drive? That's fine, going through a divorce anyway with no plans to go back into a relationship right away. The tummy troubles though do affect my job but I'll manage. This drug saved my life! I didn't realize how bad I was until the drug took affect and suddenly my life was better(even with divorce, finance trouble, stress). I didn't try the name brand but the generic is working for me."

They went from a caring, calm, loving individual, to an aggressive monster. They began drinking alcohol, doing drugs, not caring about their education or career path. You would think that this sounds like depression itself! The thing is, they did not behave like this before taking the lexapro. The person became depressed because of a death in the family. They were behaving normally prior to taking the lexapro. The lexapro changed them! It was horrific to experience. Lexapro/escitlopram is THE WORST of the SSRIs. "

Started Lexapro 8 months ago. 10mg for 2 weeks then 20 mg since. First few days were aweful and almost quit. Had weird head, strange dreams, couldn't sleep. it really was aweful but after a week it was much easier and the depression and anxiety were significantly reduced. After 2 weeks the side effects were nonexistant (except for gas). No significant side effects after upping to 20mg. 

I have been on 20mg for 7 months and feel GREAT! It saved my life. The only remaining side effects are that I can eat until I explode. I've gained about 10 lbs but I have been more careful to not overeat lately and have that under control. The other is somewhat reduced ability to orgasm. No problem, I was a hair trigger before so we are both better off now.

I plan on slowely getting off the Lexapro over the next few months because the family, health and financial issues have eased. I do have some fear of widthdrawal or the returning of anxiety and/or depression but I don't want to stay on this forever so I need to know if I can handle the reduced stress or not.

Lexapro saved my life. Don't give up because of short term side effects. Give it a few weeks. Best decision I ever made."

It helped me get through the loss of two brothers within 5 months of each other and currently I started back taking them again as I decided to quit smoking and they have helped me (now 9 months) smoke-free with anxiety, depression, feeling like I lost my best friend.  No side effects that I'm aware of but have experienced changes in my body from the quitting smoking.  I was a smoker for 48 yrs. so it was the hardest thing I ever done but I remain positive that I will remain this way.  Still have my down days but on the whole I feel great!!!!

The old saying of ""why trade a headache for an upset stomach"" comes to mind. I think I'll have to settle for the tears of the mild depression, and take the advice of one commentor who said to take a natural route.

This was the second drug I tried. This was also the worst drug I tried. It made my depression and anxiety so much worse. My panic attacks didn't get better. I kept taking it because my doctor thought it was some miracle drug and he said it would work and just to give it some time. I ended up in the hospital getting my stomach pumped because my depression/anxiety was so much worse I attempted suicide by overdose. People react to drugs differently to others and hopefully it's worked for some, but as for my experience, it made things much worse.

Everyone has to find what works for them, and changes meds is difficult and painstaking. Stick with it. You know yourself, and you'll know when you find the right meds.

I'm not a fan of taking drugs to ""fix"" a symptom (I consider depression to be a symptom of a larger problem) but I was so behind in everything and I needed to get myself up to speed again so my doctor prescribed 10mg of Lexapro and told me to take it at night. It was horrible. The first night, I took the drug and went to sleep. About an hour later, I woke up and threw up violently then proceeded to have wave after wave of panic attacks for the next 5-6 hours. The next night, I took the drug and told myself that the first night was probably just my body adjusting to the new medication and that I would be fine and it wouldn't happen again. But it happened again. And again. And again. I had constant panic attacks for about 2 weeks before I just stopped taking the drug. I couldn't handle it. I wasn't sleeping at all. And my doctor had the nerve to tell me that I caused the panic attacks - but I wasn't causing them - I'm well versed in panic attacks and I know when I'm causing them and when they just happen. I don't recommend just stopping the drug like I did because that could REALLY MESS YOU UP but I made sure I was watched for a couple days after I stopped taking it in case something happened. The antidepressant part actually did work - I felt a lot better and that ""heavy cloud"" feeling was gone but I just couldn't handle the panic attacks so I decided to deal with the depression on my own and it took longer than I wanted but it's gone now and I didn't ever go back on a drug to do it.

328$Depression$5/9/2015 5:02:45 AM$Reviewer: JP, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've always had intense anxiety and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anorexia, EDNOS, anxiety disorder. 

A year ago, after a 20-year battle, I admitted myself into residential treatment for an eating disorder. The eating disorderwas my coping mechanism to self medicate, in a sense: starvation made my highs less intense and gave me purpose during my depressive lows.

Without my usual coping mechanisms, the depression didn’t lift. After two months wondering what the point of it all was, in nearly unbearable physical and mental pain, with NOTHING I could think of that would make me happy, I realized I needed help.

So I saw a psychiatrist who put me on 5 mg of Lexapro.

The very first day, I felt it. I know that’s rare, but I’m super sensitive. I entertained the possibility of it being a placebo effect, but I know it’s not. How?

Well, I’ve been a nervous sweater my whole life. I drench my clothes in tense situations, in freezing cold, in heat. The first day on Lexapro, the sweating went from excessive to normal. This is not something you can change with a placebo effect. 

The pain in my chest started to ease, I noticed colors and sounds and smells in a pleasant way rather than not noticing them at all, or being totally overwhelmed by them.

I could face the everyday tasks that had felt impossible before. I started feeling for the first time in my life, “This must be a bit what it feels like to be a normal person.”

It’s been two and a half weeks. I had a few side effects initially: dry mouth, clenching jaw, foggy head, loss of appetite, hot puffy hands and feet, and a surge of foggy exhaustion for about two hours after taking my morning 5 mg pill.

It subsided within a week. It’s completely even now.

I have a full range of emotions. I don’t feel the meds now. I just feel like I can breathe a little better. I have a little more strength to face the every day things. I even feel joy again now and then. "

It doubled my depression to the point at which it was unbearable. I've had a couple friends that also took it as well that have had bad experiences with it. It also made me eat a lot more and gain almost 10 pounds.
335$Depression$3/16/2015 12:15:01 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$4$This SSRI works better for me than the others. It definitely controls my  depression/anxiety disorder. Two side effects are problematic: weight gain and trouble achieving orgasm. I have found the benefits outweigh the side effects. I wish a 15-mg. tablet was available. A 10-mg dose leaves me vulnerable to depression symptoms, while a 20-mg dose is too sedating. I take about 15 mg. per day by splitting a 20-mg. tablet into a 1/2 piece and a 1/4 piece. That dosage works well.

339$Depression$2/9/2015 10:07:45 AM$Reviewer: shelleyb34, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I experienced an almost immediate lifting of the dark cloud that has followed me everywhere for the last few years.  I thought that it might make me zombie-like and not able to experience emotion but it did not do that at all.  The only negative side effect that I have noticed is difficulty waking up to my alarm in the morning (late to work everyday now because I can't get up) and drowsy while at work.  I am a 44 yo female and take 10mg at bedtime.  I read that I might be able to take 5mg in the morning and 5mg with dinner and that might help with the drowsiness.  Other than that this medication has helped to ease the deep depression that I've been feeling and I am back to  smiling and feelings of general happiness.

I take 20mg per day and have experienced very few side effects. When I first started taking it I had a hard time falling asleep and then once asleep had a hard time staying asleep. I would often wake up because my arms and legs moved around a lot while sleeping. I switched to taking Lexapro in the morning instead of before bed and the symptoms quickly went away. I have also found that I sweat a lot more while exercising. Not very ladylike, but I can live with it.

I started taking it for depression and GAD, and about a month after I got up to 20mg/day, it finally kicked in and I feel amazing. I no longer feel utterly hopeless and useless; I don't dwell constantly on negatives or worry incessantly about everything (in fact, I can't even -force- myself to ruminate, which is a weird feeling); I'm actually cheerful 90% of the time and hardly ever have down days anymore; and I feel a lot more confident and outgoing and actually comfortable around people. Overall, lexapro has made me so much more positive and relaxed and, well, ""normal"". I can finally just get on with things and enjoy life instead of moping around and worrying. And I don't feel like it has blunted my emotions at all either, which is something I heard a lot about beforehand. Plus, apart from some heavy tiredness and constant yawning during the first couple of weeks. I haven't had any side effects (no weight gain, thankfully!), so that's a huge plus. Now I just hope that these wonderful effects actually last!"

Constant anxiety, no sleep, mind did not stop running, felt like my body was flying away from me in all different directions.  Got close to a total mental break down.  Was given Lexapro, 10/mg daily, within a week I was sleeping & started to be able to cope again.  No side effects, no weight gain.  After 1st year, needed a refill & was terrified MD would not refill because I felt wonderful on it.  I took it for another year (2 years total).  Mom passed away & hubby in remission.  Felt I needed to try life again without it.  I weaned myself off over a 2 month period skipping days inbetween until my last bottle was gone.  Two months was not long enough for the 'weaning period', I had most of the withdrawal side effects already mentioned off & on for about 6-8 months after.  It wasn't fun, but my only regret is that I did not 'wean' long enough.  If I ever needed it again, it would be my drug of choice.  However, I would do a much longer weaning period & research how to do so correctly. It's a wonderful drug to get you through when life events are too much to handle.

I don't know, this is the 3rd anti-depressant I've been on in the past 10 years & they've all made me feel ""zombiefied"" so maybe that's just how they react with me.

I finally decided that I wanted to feel what it was like to not be on a drug and a large reason for my decision was that I just wasn't feeling any type of feelings on it.  It was not the hardest thing in the world to get off this drug and in the end I feel so much better and am able to cry again, which is so good for you in my opinion.  I also quit smoking and drinking a year later and now my moods are so steady and normal, like they used to be when I was in my 20s.  I feel young again and happy.  I would have to say quitting smoking was harder than getting off Lexapro, so if you want to get off of this drug..you can do it!  It takes about six months to feel normal again but you must taper off.  I did it on my own that way because my Doctor actually told me I would be better off staying on it since it's difficult to stop taking it..can you believe it?  They are in it for the money...no doubt. Good luck!

My daughter and niece are also taking it and have had tremendous improvement.  However, the side effects became intolerable.  First symptom, severe dried, chapped lips.  They are so bad that skin peels off in multiple layers a day and my mouth is now raw and red.  Second, after a few months, my hair started falling out in clumps.  Third, severe insomnia.  I was taking 15 mg once a day.  My daughter takes 7.5 mg and is doing ok but has the severe chapped lips problem also.  My niece is also taking it and is having severe chapped lips also.

I had to go off of the medication about 3 weeks ago and my lips have not improved yet nor has my hair stopped falling out.  It's such a shame because I did feel much better while taking it.

Lexapro is a drug, the real one, just like the other depression medications. Just ask yourself, why MDs don’t take these drugs, because they know better. By the suggestion and encouragement of my MD friend I switched to natural remedies, diet, exercise, positive thinking, St. John’s, etc. and even though it was ong and hard road to recovery, it WORKED. I’ve been where you are and was able to turn the corner without drugs, just natural remedies. Good luck to all of you.

Coming off of this medication was one of the hardest things I ever did, but I am a much better person for it. Most people don't need to be on these types of pills, and some people do. You are strong enough to get off this medication and change the things in your life that are causing you to take it in the first place. I recently spent a month in the ICU of a hospital where I had a sudden perforated gastric ulcer which no doctors could figure out what caused. I never had problems with acid in my stomach or abdominal pain or any other symptom of an ulcer until it perforated and it was the most excruciating pain I have ever felt. After doing research, I found out that the cause of my perforated ulcer was most likely the Lexapro paired with NSAID pain relievers. These medications cause more harm than is worth making you ""happy"". I strongly advise not taking these types of anti-depressants unless it is your absolute last resort. Coming off Lexapro was a horrible experience, with all the withdrawal symptoms but putting those chemicals in my body was not worth it. It will take you a while to feel like a brand new person but in the end it is all worth it."

The doctor told me it could take up to 1 month for the pill to really start working.  I'm holding out until the month is over but I have a horrible time sleeping which causes me to be exhausted and completely unmotivated during the day.  I literally have no desire to get out of bed.  I tend to sleep for 2-3 hours once I fall asleep, wake up for another 2-3 hours and then sleep so lightly, I feel like I'm still awake until I finally give up because the tossing and turning gets too much.

In addition to a reduced sex drive, I have a difficult time achieving an orgasm... even alone (which, as most ladies know, sometimes it is the only way).

I've been on various medications for the last ten years due to persistent, low-grade depression.  Celexta gave me bruxism, Zoloft made me want to do nothing but sleep, and Cymbalta was great for me, but just stopped working after a couple of years. So my doc started me on this and it did nothing. Until I tried to stop taking it!  Since then (and I've tapered off very slowly accd'g to instruction), I've experienced intolerable levels of irritability, anger, and hostility and have turned into a monster.  I believe it's all due to this drug, and it's going to cost me $$$ in increased therapy sessions to get through this. I've already lost friends and damaged my marriage. This drug is a TOTAL FARCE. "
527$Depression$5/30/2013 8:08:27 AM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$Lexapro ruined my family's life. I would not recommend this drug to anyone! It created aggression, hostility, weight gain, alchoholism, and it made the person into a total zombie. Lexapro is EVIL.

532$Depression$5/19/2013 6:43:40 PM$Reviewer: Vince, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"Lexapro helped my depression a few years back when both Wellbutrin and another did not work out well for me.

Lexapro did help my depression but I felt it kind of brought me to a mellow happy medium. I wasn't back to being excited about everything and being full of life, but I could get through the normal day fine and was overall happy. It got my life back on track. I did notice the sexual side effects others have noted and the doctors mentioned. Its hard to kill a 20 year olds sex drive entirely, however I did notice while in a relationship that it would take some extra effort to be ready every night, if there was a day or two in between it was fine. Sex was more enjoyable once off it. I noticed that I lasted basically as long as I wanted to and had a hard time finishing quickly if needed.  This med has its ups and downs but did help somewhat. Currently back to battling depression even worse and trying a different drug."

565$Depression$3/25/2013 3:31:36 PM$Reviewer: Les, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I have suffered from major depression and anxiety for over two decades.  Lexapro is the best of all the a/ds I've taken.  I've taken many.  I think Lexapro is the purest of the SSRIs. Its been clean and effective.  By clean, I mean the initial side effect was minor: stomach upset for 2 or 3 days.  I think that's a good start compared to the side effects of most a/ds.  I started feeling noticeably better in two weeks.  I'm now completing the first month and I don't think I'm done improving.  This medication allows me to function normally. No more black hole sadness, most anxiety gone, no feelings of baseless guilt, worthlessness, etc.  Little things don't freeze me into inaction. I'm starting to enjoy life again.  I even laugh now and then.  Lexapro has really helped-- but I still have to put my best foot forward each day to cognitively add to the chemical boost of Lexapro. Only concern now:  No ejaculation.  I can still get an erection with the help of an e.d. med. I'm holding out a slim hope that with time my body will adjust and I'll return somewhere close to normal.  For now, though, feeling better is the most important aspect of my life.  So far, so good.

After about 10 days I started feeling like a zombie, slept great at night, woke up the next morning to get ready for work, really tired like I hadn't slept for days and then trying to function at work was another task. Felt so drained, eyes heavy, yawning alot and didn't feel like doing anything but going back to bed. Now my doctor is starting me on a low dose of another medication. Lets see what happens.

583$Depression$2/25/2013 3:00:25 PM$Reviewer:  (Patient) $1$1$1$The manufacturers who market this drug have gotten in trouble for unethical marketing practices. This is the most potent of the SSRIs inhibiting serotonin re-uptake far more than other SSRIs. This causes a higher incidence of serotonin syndrome with this drug. It also causes increased side effects like aggression, apathy, and sexual dysfunction. Overall this drug is not healthy. Celexa is a far better alternative to Lexapro, which is far too potent.

594$Depression$2/7/2013 10:25:32 PM$Reviewer: Not blue sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I took this medication every night (10-15 mgs) for almost 10 years for prolonged low grade depression. In order to alleviate the lethagy, I was also taking bupropion in the morning (300 mg) in the morning.  This worked very well for me.  I recently decided it was time to try to live without the drugs.  I was struggling with mood swings but they were not long lasting and I thought I would level out.  However, when superstorm Sandy hit and my house was badly damaged, I found that I was in a depression.  When I went back on them, my prescription drug plan filled it with the generic version and this caused severe reflux (heartburn), headaches and was not as effective in lifting the depression.  I had it refilled with the original Lexapro and all my side effects disappeared and I felt much better emotionally.  Since I am no longer working full time, I do not need the bupropion anymore as I do not need to function at that pace anymore.

It made me increasingly depressed to the point that I stayed in bed most of the day.  They then had to gradually decrease my dosage over a month's time to get me off it.  If I tried to reduce the dosage faster, the depression was multiplied.  I asked my pharmacist about it and he said that a lot of other people reported this problem.  Very bad joke to take a drug for depression which makes you 10 times more depressed.

I started taking Lexapro about 6 months ago for anxiety and depression.  It helped for that, but I had a lot of short-term memory problems while using it.  I would forget what I was going to do constantly.  I discovered a lot of other people on-line also had this problem, and many of them had long-term memory problems even after quitting the drug.  I have quit taking it, because it is just not worth losing my memory over.  I have started taking natural supplements called ""True Calm"" which contain GABA, Glycine, Taurine, Inositol, and Valerian.  It works like a charm.  I am so glad I found it.  Also am looking into taking Passionflower, which have good reviews for anxiety."

696$Depression$6/27/2012 1:24:46 AM$Reviewer: candi3026, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$My husband started getting very depressed about 7 months ago, he stopped doing things that he had previously enjoyed, barley left the house and was sleeping exessivly.  He became extremely irratable, mean, aggressive and miserable towards everyone.  This drug was like a miracle drug at first within 2 weeks he seemed happy again. One of my big concerns is that 3 times he forgot to get the lexapro at the pharmacy for 1 day and his mood swings were so severe! He was so annoyed, aggrevated, miserable, nasty and mean all 3 times that he missed his dose for  1 night each.  3 nights ago he missed his dose and i actually stayed at a hotel yesterday thats how bad he was.  I cant believe that missing one dose can change his personality, mood and attitude so quickly but it did! Also he still dosnt want to leave the house, still sleeps excessivly but although his personality (when he takes it every day) is so much better along with his general mood he still has alot of symptoms of depression.  We are going to ask the Dr. to wein him off this, I cant be staying at a hotel everytime he forgets or misses 1 dose for 1 day...thats rediculous I dont think any medication should have that kind of severe effect if you miss it just one time.

I did stop using it for a few months and the withdrawals were not fun.. even when tapering. However the depression came back full force so I went back on the Lex. I did try the generic by Mylan for about a month and although it is effective it is not as strong for sure! I noticed the depression slowly creeping back. Also I've had bad diarhhea and nausea while on the generic. It costs about 10 bucks less than the name brand so in my opinion it's just not worth it. I might as well take Lexapro which helps more without the side effects.

749$Depression$4/8/2012 4:32:08 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year$3$2$3$"I've had two major depressive episodes and decided to take Lexapro for the last one. I have also tried Zoloft and Prozac in the past and generally do not take medication between episodes. Lexapro worked quickly and well--I felt improvements within a week and completely recovered after about two months. It's clearly effective. I do have some complaints, however: 1. First and foremost, Lexapro has a nasty withdrawal. I have never had a problem coming off SSRIs in the past but had significant trouble with this one. Tons of ""brain zaps,"" irritability, mood swings, etc. It's a real pain to taper off. Make sure to do it very carefully, slowly, and under supervision. If you taper off too quickly, you could end up depressed all over again. 2. Sexual side effects were the worst of any SSRI I've taken. In my case, much lower libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Most SSRIs have these extremely unfortunate side effects, but this one gave me the most trouble. 3. Dosing is a bit awkward. 10mg didn't work quite well enough for me and 20mg worked but made me feel like a spaced-out zombie. I was too frustrated by the end to try 15, admittedly, but there isn't much room for finding an ideal dosage. 4. Extremely expensive if insurance doesn't cover it. It's set to go generic this year, although I don't have the latest news on this. Every medication works different for everybody, and this was only my experience. I would first and foremost say that if you feel depressed or anxious, make sure you see a therapist and make appropriate lifestyle changes. If you need an antidepressant, I would recommend Prozac--very cheap, works for me at the minimal dose (20mg) and no withdrawal. Maybe this will work for you, but I won't be taking it again."

I was told that this drug should just make me feel better in terms of missing energy. I was provided 10 boxes containing 10 (10)mg tablets by his office along with a prescription for 90 tablets.

Timeline:

1-	Visited Doctor on about 3rd week of February 2011 and began prescription of one 10mg tablet of Lexapro a day.
2-	Consumed the initial office provided tablets by which a prescription was filled for 90 tablets on May 26 2011
3-	59 tablets were consumed and prescription stopped (cold turkey) on or around July 24 2011
4-	 Unbeknown to us  due to the absence of any discussion, pamphlet, ect. I was launched into state of mania shortly after discontinuing Lexapro medication.
5-	On August 3rd I submitted my resignation to my employer after 21 year 6 months of service with a fictitious place of employment going forward as I was in a manic state.
6-	During the remainder of time I acted in words only (email) in a very hostile manner to many layers of upper management essentially black balling myself.
7-	Over the month of August I found myself reacting in a hostile manner with three individuals in public with no reason and only due to the manic state I incurred from Lexapro. None of these encounters turned physical.
8-	I entered into a sales agreement for 150k to acquire a new boat. Grandiose spending.
9-	After the surrender of my Company provided car on August 29th I proceeded to purchase a new BMW lease car (500.00 per month) without an income. Grandiose spending.
10-	This manic state persisted until end of October where a very deep depression ensued.

It did work for treating my depression. I often wonder if I didn't go to the doctor when I did if I would even be alive today.  Geez, looking back it was that bad. 

It took me 2 attempts to quit taking the lexapro both within a 6 month period. The withdrawals were unpleasant. 

Today- 4-5 months later, my depression has left me, I sorted out my personal problems in my head and feel stable. Unfortunately, almost tooo stable minded, as if nothing even phases me anymore. Somewhat emotionless  lately. 

Also, I am experiencing sexual issues as well. Difficulty maintaining ejaculating during sex and difficulty sharing emotions with partners. This was one of the side effects that brought me to quit taking Lexapro, yet I still am experiencing the same side effects. Without a doubt it makes my relationships strange. 

Conclusion, I do believe lexapro treated my depression, but now I have side effects that are good reason to be depressed yet I feel nothing. Ha...how bout that!?

Not long after taking it, my depression got worse. I turned to being suicidal. It also changed my sex drive to non existent. I was in my early 20's and I knew this wasn't normal. After the last and final time of attempting suicide, I finally talked to my doctor about it and she quickly took me off the lexapro. Since then, I have done better. I have personally decided to deal with my disorders without medication, which has been rough but lexapro has scared me into this decision. My 13 year old suffers from manic depression and ADHD. They are also considering that he may be bipolar. His doctor is switching him from zoloft and vyvance to lexapro and adderall. I am now afraid that this medicine will have the same affect on my child as it did me. The fact that he already has suicidal thoughts prier to lexapro make it worse. If any of you have a child like mine, I'd really love your feedback on these medications. my email is [email protected]

I found that the Lexapro helped me to cope, HOWEVER, the Lexapro SIGNIFICANTLY increased my appetite.  (Note:  I did not have a problem with loss of appetite before taking Lexapro. I was at a healthy weight.)  I gained 25 lbs. in about 6 months which increased my pre-diabetic symptoms----The dry mouth was not a pleasant side effect....used Biotene products, small amount of relief.  Then, some months after the weight gain, I developed high blood pressure.  I tried coming off the Lexapro after taking it for 2 plus years per Dr.'s recommendations.  Did not do well. Felt like I was going to 'jump out of my skin'.  I very gradually came off the drug over a 3 month period which worked fairly well, but it was a pain.  The constipation was a very unpleasant side effect which led to hemorhoids (which I never had in my 50 plus years, not even pregnancy!) in spite of increasing fiber.  Almost NO libido, which my husband did not understand and had no empathy, but that was more his self-centered character. It definately had a negative impact on reconciling our marriage.  So, I should have tried another medication(s)...I had so much chaos at the time, I did was overwhelmed &/or did not care.

I attended there for 17 years. For 5 years I taught at VBS and after graduating high school I began teaching Sunday school, Wednesday nite classes, and I directed the Christmas play. I became so passionate about my church and I loved the children I taught. They were my best friend. Them and God became my world. In September 2010, a huge fight broke out between members of the church and I decided it was in my best interest to resign from my positions. I lost my church family, a lot of my family, and my boyfriend at the time(the ""one""). I became completely depressed. I turned to food to help me feel better and I became so angry and bitter about everything. I didn't feel like going to school and ended up dropping out of all my classes Spring and Summer of 2011. I gained over 60 pounds. When I went to the doctor, my orginal request was only to check my thyroid because I no longer had any energy at all. My doctor begin to break the surface on my past and prescribed me lexapro(10mg). I am no longer depressed. I am so happy and the little things that have always bugged me, upset me, no longer does. I felt like I could move on from the things that happened. Since I have been on lexapro, I have lost 6lbs and began attending another church. I am now in the process of moving my membership there.

Then went to Lexapro 10mg then up to 20 mgs and have done much better on this. After years of Chronic pain I have now developed some depression and I suppose it does have some effect in controlling it but I still get times of deep depression, only beacause of the state of my life and limitations put on me not being able to life like a normal person and do all the activities I used to do and have interest in.  But you have to pull your mind together and thank God that you are not in worse shape like some others have to suffer through or live and Rubuke those thoughts of feeling sorry for yourself or cheated out of life!  Your still living right?  So live life to the fullest way that YOU can is what I have learned.  Ultimately you are in control of your mind, medication can help but it is not a cure at least for me.  But I am not suffering any mental illness like really brain chemistry imbalance where you have a brain impairment.  So I'm in the middle of the road wish I felt happier but don't know if Lexapro will do that for me.

It was very effective and I used it for about four years.  During that four years, I gained 110 pounds and did not even care--in fact, I cared about nothi8ng at all, or even doing anything at all.  Libdo went to absolutely zero.  Zombiefied.  Stopped taking the drug and developed severe anxiety attacks requiring another medication.  Additional negative side effects were slow but continual increasing nerve pain in feet and along the side of left leg.  Pain also began in right leg after experienceing it in left for several months. These pains totally disappeared in about two weeks after stopping Lexapro.  Evaluation is the drug does counteract depression but it can have severe side effects.  Be very careful and watch for adverse effects.  I would NOT recommend it to anyone.

I am currently taking 20 mg, even though that seems a lot but 10 mg didn't work basically at all. It works for me, but because of my age, it's best for teenagers to be unmedicated  in my opinion because of the extreme possible side effects it can have just taking it not only initially but if you forget to take it. Since Lexapro, I don't cry as much over small things, but big issues are still no use. I haven't had as many nightmares, but I did notice (since in the past i've missed taking it a few nights) I would get terrible nightmares, and feel so jittery  the next day that I almost had to leave school, since even though I have more of depression. Anxiety hyped me up to  an uncontrollable level. Be careful, guys.

Lack of sleep caused performance anxieties leading to depression. Pediatrician prescribed Lexapro. Coaches reported he seemed more relaxed but at home he seemed to no longer care about anything, or anyone. Personality change, lost all empathy,became mean, agressive, and violent. Side effects included extreme fatigue, which made anxiety and depression worse, weight gain, agitation, dizziness, light-headed, tingling. Couldn't get up for school, confrontational with teachers, GPA drop from 3.989 to 2.929. Weaned off over 1 month, immediate improvement but personality changes still remain to some degree. Devastating effects on entire family and almost destroyed our business at same time. Drs should not prescribe to youth and should be more aware of physical and mental side-affects and provide more warnings. We force our kids to keep taking when they complain because Dr says to. I'm thankful we didn't end up with violent or suicidal actions. I'd rather deal with the original problems vs just covering them up and dealing with the even worse side-affects.

With that said, this medicine was to treat me for depression. But instead it made me have very vivid terrible dreams. It also made me have really messed up thoughts, it was like something had taken over my ability to think and had weird outlandish thoughts, creepy and psychotic as well. Dealing with depression was better than what this drug did to me. Needless to say I got off of it and am now taking generic Zoloft. Way better. I have had no side effects with gen. Zoloft. I know each drug effects different people differently..but wanted to post what I went through. Scary Stuff..hope no one ever goes through what I did on that drug. If I'd have stayed on it no doubt I could have had some major psychotic issues.

It takes a few weeks to kick in but once you get your dosage figured out it really does help. It does not completely take away all of your symptoms but it comes pretty close to getting rid of them. I did not experience side affects except for when I did not take the medicine for a few days. I would get extremely nauseous and sometimes it resulted in vomiting. My doctor decided to change my medicine because after 6 years it seems that the medicine is no longer working which is to be expected after being on it for so long.

No - it was SO effective, that I forgot everything - I had to write down where I was going when I got in my car, because I forgot once I sat down. It was very strong. I had to come off of it after a month.

Insomnia is so severe, I am nonfunctional day and night I am seeing a neurologist at the UCSF MS Clinic and the add on antiinsomnia medicine doesn't work...so it's been 5 weeks of NONfunctional sleep cycles. Activating meds are not tolerated well. Insurance requires a sleep med trial I'd tried over 10 years ago, this is prolonging the insomnia.

At first, I thought it was working only because it didn't give me the nasty physical side effects that Effexor did (severe nausea, debilitating diziness).   I did experience the typical nightsweats and lower sex drive (it severely hurt my relationship at the time), but the most alarming side effect was that I was throwing serious tantrums and fits.  This was absolutley not characteristic of me and made others around me nervous, so after almost a year I discontinued the meds.

Upon the advice of my dr. and pharmacist, I tried halving it. I found the 10 mg. dose effective with limited side effects. I did have stomach pain for the first few days. It has worked for me- it keeps me on a relatively even keel, but I don't feel like a zombie or sleepy.

But the results were immediate.  I have been taking it a few years now, and I have taken dosages from 10mg to 40mg.  I am back down to 20mg a day and holding.  I have gained weight while taking it.  I have come off lexapro twice for about a month each time only to recognize that life is better with it.  My doctor switched me to prozac in the beginning, but I quickly knew that wasn't a good fit, and he put me back on lexapro with a dose increase.  Life has been great after that.  To those who say that lexapro caused personality changes, I would say keep trying other meds.  I had that reaction to prozac.  Everyone's system is slightly different and will respond to a different med.  Keep trying meds until you can look back and say, yeah, life is definitely better with ---.  For me, life is better with lexapro.

This drug made him into an aggressive, ""zombie"". (Along with many other terrible effects.) Please stay away from this drug! There are better, more effective, older drug alternatives that the pharmaceutical companies aren't pushing, This is because the pharmaceutical companies can no longer make money off of the old drugs so they invent or slightly modify other drugs and market them as more expensive. Lexapro is an extremely horrible drug. It makes people aggressive and changes personalities for the worse. Stay away. There are multiple lawsuits against the makers of the drug ""Lexapro"" (Forest Laboratories) for deceptive marketing and others for horrible, negative effects of this substance.

1109$Depression$3/13/2011 11:02:48 PM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$"My father was given this after my grandmother died. It completely changed his personality. Before he took it he was a sweet, loving person. This drug made him into an aggressive, ""zombie"". (Along with many other terrible effects.) Please stay away from this drug! There are better, more effective, older drug alternatives that the pharmaceutical companies aren't pushing, This is because the pharmaceutical companies can no longer make money off of the old drugs so they invent or slightly modify other drugs and market them as more expensive. Lexapro is an extremely horrible drug. It makes people aggressive and changes personalities for the worse. Stay away.
      There are multiple lawsuits against the makers of the drug ""Lexapro"" (Forest Laboratories) for deceptive marketing and others for horrible, negative effects of this substance. Please find other, FDA approved, tried and true, alternatives to this terrible substance (under the care of a good quality physician). Thank you. I sincerely hope that my voice is heard! :)"

I have lost 15 pounds in a month, can't fall asleep, have no sex drive, difficuly orgasming, sometimes feel spacey and am nervous about going off of it eventually after reading the withdrawl symptoms.

I have experienced depression for over 20 years.  This is the only one that finally made me feel ""normal"".  I stopped getting angry over every little thing, I stopped worrying about minor things, I was very happy.  I have since weaned myself off of this drug, it has taken over 9 months.  It is VERY hard to get off and you need to be committed to weaning yourself very slowly.  It will make you crazy if you don't.  The reason I am weaning myself off of this medication is for two reasons.  The first being that I have gained over 10 pounds on the 5 years that I taken it.  I CANNOT lose weight no matter how I eat or exercise. It has affected my metabolism in some way.  The second reason is that it has affected my libido in a negative way.  I have very little interest in sex.  It has not affected my ability to climax, but just the ""getting going"" part.  I am now realizing that I still need medication, my irritability and anxieties have returned.  I need to find something that will help me without the negative side effects."

I started on 10mg and felt spacey so dropped to 5mg. I have been at this dose for 2.5 years. I have been pleasantly surprised at the result - I know I am ""on"" something but it does not get in the way of my daily activity. I am able to let go of hostile situations more easily. I am able to ""choose my battles"" easier. It gives me a bit of a pause button so I am not so quick to become overwhelmed, sad, upset, angry. I still do feel these emotions, just have more control of them. I once forgot my medication on a week long trip and the withdrawal was tolerable, but I would not recommend it! Several times throughout the day I would get some flashes behind my eyes and the world would seem to vibrate for a few seconds, then it would pass. As far as starting the drug or changing the dose, ""they"" say that the drug takes 2 weeks to take effect. Maybe in most patients but not this one! No kidding, I increase my dosage to 10mg and I feel it within hours. Now I increase my dose to 10mg for a few days around my cycle and it helps with the severe PMS/PMDD I experience. Maybe all in my head? I chart my cycle and there are many more PMS-induced arguments when I don't take the increased dose! The only bummer I can tell is low libido. Yeah, BUMMER. Well, the price of the drug is another bummer. As a cost savings I tried something similar - a generic called citalopram - it was AWFUL! It made me feel more than spacey - very messed up and more emotional. Good luck!"

I probably shouldn't have taken it then, but my Dr wanted to try it and see if chest tightness, panic attacks, and thumpy heartbeat went away.  I did notice very vivid dreams during the first 2 weeks on it.  The dreams weren't scary, just very very vivid.
I stopped Lexapro in 2008 and experienced some withdrawl symptoms, the worst being the ""brain zaps"", feeling like electrical jolts were running through my brain.  That lasted about a week and then went away.

I recently went on Lexapro again in 2010 for anxiety and depression and the return of physical symptoms (thought I was having a heart attack, but it was anxiety).  Upon starting Lexapro again, I didn't have any vivid dreams but my physical symptoms went away.
Now I take 10 Mg/day and, while the physical symptoms are gone, my mood is rather neutral, rather than happy or sad.  Also, libido is very low.  Weight gain has occured, even though I don't really feel hungry most of the time.
However, while some of the side effects annoying and bothersome, not to mention the cost of the drug, Lexapro has been very helpful in getting me out of the hole I was stuck in."

I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg two days ago and I was crying/angry/severely depressed within a few hours.  Nausea, too.  I'm used to this side effect because I felt the same increased anger/anxiety with both Zoloft and Wellbutrin after about 4-5 days, so I'm really going to try to stick with it to see if symptoms improve.  I'm frustrated that I don't seem to respond to these meds well.  I just need something to work.  I could barely leave the house the past few days.  I'll give it another 2 weeks (maybe) and if symptoms of anxiety and anger don't improve, I'm giving up on Lexapro, too.  I'm willing to put up with this very temporarily, but I was honestly doing better BEFORE starting Lex than I am now.  This med is still better than Zoloft, which was a nightmare for me.  The best drug I've been on so far (for me) was Pristiq.

1269$Depression$10/10/2010 10:56:38 PM$Reviewer: Sadie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I was diagnosed last winter with depression and social anxiety. I am also an alcoholic. My Dr wanted me to start with 5 mg and after a few weeks move up to 10. At first it was great but when I went up to 10 mg I had the side effects of sweating at night, vivid dreams and heavy menstrual periods. I felt zoned out too. I even had a major panic attack so I stopped taking it. Well the feelings of anxiety and despair came creeping back and I started drinking again. A few months ago I decided to quit drinking for good and I started 5 mg of Lex again. No symptoms this time! After a month I went up to 10 mg and still no side effects! I feel great.. no social anxiety! I am finally able to live, for myself and my children. And I am proud to say that I am 3 months sober and I believe the Lexapro has helped. The only downside is that I have heard the withdrawals are terrible. Someday I hope to be able to wean off of the meds but for now I am enjoying life again!

I can function fully (no more staying in bed all day),hold a job, and actually enjoy interacting with others. Of course I still have certain times when events cause depression, but the difference is, with Lexapro, I can deal with it and move on, whereas before, I couldn't.  I never want to feel the horrible, hopelessness that used to be part of my everyday living.

Dr prescribed Lexapro as a trial since I've never taken meds before. Took it for 4 weeks and was happy with the results but paranoid that the Lexapro was just a placebo as I had no side effects whatsoever. Went off Lexapro and within 2 days had reverted to Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde behaviour. After a week of that I went back on Lexapro for sanity's sake.

I gained about 30 pounds over that time period.  I finally decided to go off of it, because of the weight gain, it was not helping at all, and it was in fact making things worse.  I weaned myself off slowly.  The withdrawal effects ARE TERRIBLE.  Weird head 'zapping', dizziness, nausea...I could go on and on.  After almost 3 weeks off of Lexapro, I am starting to feel normal again, and have lost 11 pounds.  I would NOT recommend taking this drug.  The side effects while on the drug, as well as the withdrawal symptoms, made taking Lexapro a bad experience.  I am sad I wasted over 3 years of my life on this medication.

I rarely ever take antibiotics and cant stand people that medicate every little problem they have.  But, after a devestating divorce I found myself severely depressed and for the first time asked my doctor for help for what he called ""situational depression.""  Initially, it made me feel horrible, panicky and unable to sleep, but was told to at least give my body a month to get used to it.  Within a couple of weeks, I felt calmer, happier and less stress.  As my body got used to the drug, I was able to sleep better and actually lost weight on this drug!  I would absolutely recommend trying it.

I got a check up a week ago and I told her that I wasn't feeling any better over all but she said I had to keep at it to feel any better. (she also added clonazapam...which doesn't do anything! they chould be sugar pills for all they do)...  About 45 min after I take the lexapro I feel really out of it ""trippy"". That is the best part to look forward to. I can just space out and not worry.  I take it at night before I go to bed so I don't have to worry about functioning. But the next day, 12 hours later I still get really nervous driving to work because I have a hard time paying attention to the road.  My anger, and anxiety are the same if not worse at times. I have noticed that sometimes I am more obsessed with organizing things and stressing if things aren't in there place which isn't normal. I have to wait another month and go back to the doc.  I hope it either starts working or I can switch to something that actually works. Maybe my expectations are unrealistic.  But feeling alittle better would be better than nothing. "

After about two weeks I noticed a difference in anxiety and mood.  I have been on this medication for a year straight now and I have not gained any weight. Don't get off the medication if you gain weight, possibly the weigh gain is due to a change in metabolism or diet and/or exercise.  This drug may have saved my life.  I tried Effexor first and it made me aggressive and hostile.  Lexapro affects less neurotransmitters so I think people should try it for depression first before trying Effexor.

I was in a really bad place at that point and Lexapro was a last resort (never thought I'd ever need a pill). The initial symptoms of dizziness and increased anxiety were a real pain and it took almost a month before I started to feel better. To make matters worse, it hurt my libido too. But I stuck with it and it eventually did have a very positive effect on my life. The only easy part was actually when I stopped taking it cold turkey after a year and felt zero side effects. Score!

Once again I've been going through some moderate depression/anxiety and am starting to take it again.

It helped me control my depression and anxiety.  I knew that I had to ween off this medication slowly; I had taken other SSRIs in the past (Paxil, Zoloft) and it is NOT a good idea to stop all at once, you need a plan to ween off these meds.  I started to ween myself off and had terrible side affects - dizziness, a strange head zapping feeling and increased anxiety.  I decided to stay on Lexapro awhile longer as I was busy with work and travel for my job and couldn't deal with a dizzy head.  A few months ago, I slowly started to ween off again.  My doctor told me to cut the pill in half and take 5mg each day, then after 1 week take 5mg every other day, then every 2 days.  I took it even slower and took 5mg every other day for 1 month until I felt I was ready to stop completely.  I had the same side affects - dizzy head, zapping feeling in my brain, weird body aches.  I stuck with my plan and after 2 weeks, the side affects completely disappeared and I felt completely normal.  I have not had any issues since.  My advice is to ween off slowly and stick it out if you have some mild side affects from withdrawl, because they will go away.

I then stopped for another year and started taking Lexapro.  This drug was very effective.  The doctor prescribed 10mg but I did my research and decided to start with the lowest dose which is 5mg, and have been taking that dosage for 3yrs.  The first 2 weeks showed increased symptoms but it gradually lessened and now I'm fine.  Only side effect is a dramatic decrease in libido, I can ejaculate but it's not nearly powerful as it was.  Otherwise, the drug is good.  The initial 10mg is definitely not necessary (for me).  It was much healthier (and easier) to bump up the dosage when seems fit than to start off on a real high dosage.

It took a few weeks for the medication to take effect but once it did, everyday life became much easier and I felt hopeful about the day instead of dreadful.

Now I am weaning off the drug and I feel irritated and tired all the time.  I am hoping this will begin to pass as my body adjusts.  Overall it was a good medication for what I needed, I just hope I am ready to stop taking it, it's hard to know until it's completely out of the body.

When being on the medication for two weeks I suddenly became very dizzy and went to ER vomiting.  ER doctor decided it was due to the medication and said to quit taking Lexapro and the dizziness should go away in a few days.  Medication for nausea and dizziness given but did no good.  The next day the vomiting stopped, but the dizziness continued and I had to stay in bed with my eyes closed to tolerate it.  On the third day I went to my regular doctor who agreed that it was from the Lexapro and I should be back to normal in a couple more days.  So far, not the case.  The dizziness is a little better and I am no longer vomiting, but I am unable to focus on things for very long.  I am too dizzy to drive and am not sure if I can work tomorrow.  This has been a terrible experience.  I have taken quite a few different anti-depressants with no reactions at all.  This is very scary.

Side effects I initially experienced was shaky hands and a dullness to my short term memory. One of the unusual things that happened was when an anxiety would hit I could feel the release from my brain down my arms like a tingling sensation. Very trippy experience and definitely snapped me out of the anxiety. I have been on this drug for a year and a half. Just recently weened off of it and feel pretty good. Definitely recommended.

For three years my mother suffered from a fever of unknown origin. Tylenol,ibuprofin nothing could brak the fever. i took her to multiple doctors specialists. and talked her into several procedures including bone marrow biopsies and polyp removal in her sinuses to try and get rid of this debilitating fever,malaise, fatigue and weakness.she lost 30 punds and nearly died of dehydration.After the 20th dr said he coulnt help and she told me she was ready to pass and couldnt live like this anymore i looked lexapro up in a drug book and the symptoms she had were listed. she stopped taking lexapro and the fevers and other symptoms went away. no dr bothered to look up side effects of this med and my mother almost left us. this is not a common side effect. lexapro was the miracle drug for my own depression,i wouldnt be here now without it. just please be aware of what you are taking and possible side effects. we cant leave it all to the drs we must be our own advocates in our healthcare.  Lexapro is an effective treatment for most people. This message is out there in case anyone is suffering like my mother did and is searching for answers because the drs have let them down.

1503$Depression$5/4/2010 11:14:27 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been suffering from Anxiety/Depression all my life. It was impossible for me to feel happy even when nothing was going 'badly' in my life. Finally, I sought help and was prescribed Lexapro. The first week I would wake up with dry mouth, migraines, and felt nauseous. I stuck it out though, and the side effects subsided within a week. Now, I have been able to function and reason through my problems without all the anxiety that I previously attached to them. Instead of going through the motions of being 'normal', I actually feel good. It's not a wonder drug in that it takes away your problems, but it gives you the boost you need to rationalize and work through issues. I can honestly say this is one of the best decisions I've made for myself, and I will continue my treatment.

1531$Depression$4/14/2010 2:45:39 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I havent been on this med in 2 years, and i only took it for about a week (i was prescribed it at the hospital right after I had my son for post partium depression). Anyways, they started me out taking 1/2, once everyother day for 4 days, then take 1 a day (to build it up in my system). Well, two days after i started taking a whole pill, i guess it built up enough in my system because i had a MAJOR reaction to it. My husband thought that i was high or something (and i felt it), i couldn't take care of my week old son, i felt terrible and just wanted to die. We couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, but luckily my mother-in-law was also on it and had kept the paper explaining the effects of an allergic reaction. I was shaking uncontrolably, felt as though i couldn't breath, wasn't able to hold myself up, it was bad. Anyways, my hasband took me to the hospital, they left me in the waiting room for 2 hours and i just got worse. We ended up leaving to go to another hospital, and on the way drop our son of to his sister. She called the ambulance to meet us at her house, and when we pulled up, i got out of the car and ended up falling on the ground (basically blacked out). The ambulance showed up right after and put me in and gave me that epie pen shot. It helped instantly. Anyways, i'm not writing this to say that it's a bad med (it worked wonders for my mother-in-law), I'm just writing this to warn people to watch out for a reaction and to get to the hospital immediatally if you feel off like that. I hope no one has to go thru that pain, but i do know that it happens, so be careful. I hope this helps at least one person.

I have been on it for 6 years. My doctor diagnosed me with a seratonin deficiency. She suggested that I take 1/2 a pill for the first week as it could cause nausea. That worked for me. I never have had sexual side effects either and I think it's because I take it at night. 10mg dose made me tired all the time, so I asked my doctor if I could just take 1/2 a pill. It controls my depression and I am not tired from it. The one thing I do notice is that I am not as motivated to do things as I used to be. I don't know if it's my age or the pills. All I know is I used to cry about everything and now I'm a much happier, easy-going person. It's a great medicine.

Wonderful at first!, I was way more easy-going. got along better with my husband, no longer got upset over all the little things or brooding over bullshit. The BEST part was I was no longer screaming at my 6 and 4 yr old kids(still hate myself about that), i stopped losing my temper over nothing, slowed down to enjoy them and stop demanding perfection   and precision  from my children. Then I also stopped having orgasms and no longer wanted sex at all really. Still loved the intimacy but could care less about intercourse. My husband said,""oh, come on, its a small price to pay to be happier"" (he wanted me to continue)""your so much easier to get along with, its been great!"" Yeah great for him, but it sucked for me to have my head in the clouds yet dead from the waist down at 40. I dont know I still wrestle with going back on to be a better mom, thats my real only goal. Yet my marriage was like living with a buddy cute, but NO interest in sex. Husband complained I was so ""asexual, its sad"" yet pushed me to stay on drug anyway to be ""happier"" Im disapointed it didnt seem a fair trade off, im too young to not want to feel sexual, but my kids are growing fast and I dont want them to only remember an uptight mean mommy.

This stuff worked great until I couldn't orgasm (are you kidding me?), had severe short-term memory problems, vicious headaches related to any protein I ate, intense homicidal thoughts, GERD, hernia, osteoporosis and soft, mushy, girly skin. So I got off of it and then my head felt like it almost exploded. Literally I had this horrible, intense pressure inside my head and I got numerous dilated blood vessels and red dots all over my body but especially on my face and left side of my neck. I also got intense chest pains and burning skin (pure torture). My left leg wouldn’t stop shaking. My left eye muscles kept twitching continuously. I spoke rapidly. I couldn’t concentrate on the simplest things and make any healthy decisions. I had severe insomnia, paranoia, severe inner tension, severe restlessness, severe fatigue and my depression and anxiety were now 10 times worse than before I ever took this stuff. I have never had any of these symptoms before I took this drug. I followed exactly my doctor’s instructions about how to take it and how to get off of it but it didn’t make any difference. When I told him about all the withdrawal symptoms he gave me the usual stupid doctor CYA response, “it must be something else and I have never heard of this.” What a moron. I just got off this stuff and two days later my head explodes and his idiotic logic is that something else out of the blue descended on me to cause these problems. Is this the best doctors have? You can’t be serious!!! I am better off taking cocaine than this stuff.

I was prompted by a marriage counselor to go to my doctor and request drugs for my OCD symptoms (checking, intrusive sad thoughts, previous eating disorders as a teen and heavy drinking-probably perpetuated by my father’s suicide in 1981 while he was on imipramine and numerous other psych med’s)  I went to my husband’s pcp who never met me before.  He gave me a depression self-test and diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, and then prescribed me Lexapro and Rozerem since I had a terrible insomnia problem.  He also decided it was a good idea to start kissing me and grabbing me in his office.    The Lexapro did such a good job getting me up and doing things, lots of things, but unfortunately, I believe it also may have made me nervous because it raised my blood pressure from it’s usual 120/80 to 145/110.  I was really up, up, up.   I could drink twelve shots of straight liquor and still be walking around for hours.  This was the busiest year of my life.  I managed to get 2 DUI’s  4 drunk in publics and an involuntary commit for suicide, attend 2 rehab’s, a hypnotherapist, weekly ASAP programs, all while working full time.  During the course of my medical treatment,  I was seen by 3 psychiatrists, 4 doctors, and numerous counselors.  Most of the follow up treatment involved numerous more drugs, anti-buse, campral, and Buspar.  All of which I had to stop taking  due to side effects such as full body tremors and falling down.   Finally, after the second DUI which I was also charged with a felony for pinching a police officers butt, I decided maybe I should stop taking the Lexapro b/c I seemed to have developed some obsession with alcohol and I could see I was also becoming delusional.  So, while in jail, I requested no more medication for 1 week and was able to fully withdraw from Lexapro, although the depression side effects of the withdrawal lasted about three months.  I met

And short term memory loss.  I have been taking this drug for over 3 years.  I needed it to survive severe grief.  My son and daughter-in-law decided to never let me and my husband see our grandchild again.  I was unable to perform tasks, couldn't be around happy people, and I couldn't look or go anywhere my grandchild would like. The grief was unbelievable.  I was taking care of him 24/7. My daughter-in-law is a borderline personality. And my son did anything to make her happy.
Lexapro helped me function.  However, now I am experiencing inability to focus normaly and my memory scares me. I wake up in the middle of the night regularly.  Sex is history.  I can't wait to get off it now that I am coming back to life.

I was also told that it would make me a happy camper.  Instead, it reduced my nightly sleep from a solid 3 - 4 hour stretch to maybe 1 - 2 hours a night!  After a week, the total loss of appetite and inability to eat or drink ANYTHING (everything tasted like cardboard and the smell of food repulsed me), along with the hand tremor that developed, forced me to stop taking it!  My life had quickly become worse that I could have imagined.  I had NO ability to focus on ANYTHING.  I had no emotions.  The sleep deprivation was killing me.  It took over a week for my body to fully recover from the side effects.  Then I was told to try Celexa.  That produced increased insomnia, only now instead of feeling on a caffeine high, like I had with Lexapro, I felt like when you have a stomach flu.  I tossed and turned and was unable to even rest in bed.  Now the doctor wants me to try Zoloft.  I am losing patience!

The nausea and inability to get off the couch or out of bed was unbearable.  Had to even stuggle to force myself to complete a routine task, like brush my teeth.  I had a horrible chemical smell in my nose and down my throat.  Also had wierd vivid dreams and burning feeling on hands and feet.  I live in a prone position and was sleeping about 16 hours per day.  Let's don't forget to mention the diahrea. Dr. started me on 5 mgs. daily and then was to increase to 10 mgs. after one week.  The day I was to increase to the 10 mgs. I wanted to die, not due to depression, but due to being so sick and getting physically sicker every day.  I instead went to the emergency doctor on call (it was during the 2009 holiday season) and he placed me on Zoloft.  I did not continue to get sicker each day, but a tiny better.  It took over three weeks for all of the Laxapro side effects to subside.  Seems my body is allergic to it and taking it made me feel as if I was slowly poisioning myself.  Even when someone says the name of the medicine, I get nauseated.  Doing way way way better on the Zoloft for the present.

I had been depressed for as long as I can remember. Suicide was part of my daily life, literaly. I saw doctor after doctor before actually being diagnosed properly. I am a firm believer in prayer and natural remedy's, but as the year's passed the depression worsened, so I contiued to seek help. I was told so many times, ""There is nothing wrong with you"".  I finally was diagnosed and started on Lexapro 10mg. It took 3 to 4 weeks before my depression started to subside. I have tried to go off of it on my own, and the emotional roller coaster would start again. I have my life back, and I am very greatful and thankful. I can't believe it took so long to be diagnosed and be able to be happy and enjoy life. It litarally saved my life. "

While I was on these types of meds; Like most Depression Meds. You should slowly come off of this med as it effects the chemical levels in the brain. This is probably the reason you are feeling the way you do. Each person is different and has different feelings of w/drwls. Talk with your Doctor."
1674$Depression$2/10/2010 2:24:08 PM$Reviewer: hust, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$4$Did not work at all.  After being on the drug for 8 months with no results, it took over 5 months to get off the stuff. It caused major veritgo when I would go without a dose. This made it really hard when I was trying to stop taking it. I had to gradually step down but the vertigo didn't stop until 3 weeks after my final dose.
1675$Depression$2/10/2010 1:10:48 PM$Reviewer: Obamageddon2010, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$4$"Lexapro did a good job with my anxiety disorder. I am not really a depressed person, just anxious, so I can't say if it does anything for depression or not. I will say that it caused me to have depression because of the side effects. I gained 40 lbs in less than 3 months, I lost all my sex drive and ability to climax and I was always tired....all the time. Not just sleepy, but exhausted feeling. 

I went off the Lexapro and it took nearly a year for my sex drive to return and it has returned, but not to what it was before I took it. I still have not been able to lose the weight even though I exercise an hour a day and jog 5 miles a day. It just will not come off and I do not eat that much. My shrink says it changed the make up of my motabolism and I may not get it back again. Great! I have gotten energy back again. I am not tired anymore and I require only about 5 hours of sleep a night now and I feel fine. One really good thing for me was that Lexapro had no ill effects coming off of it. I just weened myself off by taking a pill every other day, then one every few days then one a week and then none. I could not even tell a difference at all. 

I am on no medication now. I had gone on the generic brand of Wellbutrin and that was a horror story. Worse drug ever. So I am winging it alone now and doing fine. I do keep Xanax on hand in case of emergencies, but so far so good.

All in all, Lexapro is probably a good drug for a lot of people, just be aware that you may gain weight, you may experience loss of libido and you may feel tired all the time. But that was just what happen to me and we are all different."

I feel queasy for 15 mins in the morning right around the time I would take the meds. Did anyone else go through this?  How long did it last?

I feel that this product would have worked good for me. Except: While on it for less than 10 days, I had a Migraine and took Excedrine. Within 2hrs felt a sharp throbing/pulsing pain in my stomach between the Breast-Bone and Navel. 

The pain felt like someone was ringing out a towel (but my stomach was the towel). It would hurt for about 5-15 seconds, then it would completely stop for 10-15 minutes. Made worse by eating.

I've never felt anything like this before.

Since I've stopped it, it took about 3 days and now I have no pain at all.

Not sure if it was the Lexapro or the Excedrine Mixed with it."

I listened and am now feeling  great. Lexipro has  taken the edge off. It has not changed my basic personality but I feel better able to cope and deal with tough situations. I have a significant family history of depression. My father committed suicide and my grandfather suffered from what they called back in the day a nervous breakdown. I was resistant in the past to taking medication but when I was hit recently with depression where all I wanted to do was sleep and had to drag myself to work, I knew I couldn't just snap out of it.

The only problem I have had with this drug is taking it with other medications. I take fioricets almost daily due to severe migraines and along with the lexapro i begin to feel very dizzy, lightheaded, and I easily feel my heartbeat. Also it makes it difficult to breathe. The depression is gone, but now its difficult to maintain my migraines. But... the depression is gone at least.
1732$Depression$1/18/2010 4:38:19 PM$Reviewer: beans, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$2$"Lexapro really was almost like a miracle pill for me. I was given a 4 week supply sample originally to help me with a sleeping problem (as the doctor had asked if i also felt anxiety or depression). In that time, my depression had diminished (and i had EXTREMELY difficult family situations that started 2 weeks after i took it...great timing...I would have been completely depressed and beside myself, but I felt great.)

I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, overweight/obesity, cholesterol issues) a few months earlier. Lexapro lowered my high blood pressure to a perfect score, acted as an appetite suppressant, and i lost weight because of it. 

obviously this wont be the case with everyone. the only side effects i experienced were moderate nausea and occasional headaches when first incorporating the drug into my system (first week or two).

I've had varying levels of depression since i was 13. I'm now going on 22 so i still have a while to go. i was off it for 2 months and i just bought my first prescription for it. 2nd day: nausea and headache. hopefully it will just go away like it did before."

No thoughts of suicide, no anxiety, nothing like that. I was ablre to smile, laugh and joke again with friends and family. I have been on it for about 6 years now. if I miss a dose, I get headahces and weird dizzyness. My doctor wants to try me on Celexa, but I don't think it works as well for me. Lexapro is a drug you need to work with. You have to police yourself. It's not a miracle drug some people try to say it is.

Lexapro has saved my life. I was prescribed the drug for severe anxiety and mild depression. The first time I was on it, I took it for about 3 months in the morning and I had the sexual side effects, loss of libido and I could not have an orgasm to save my life!! I stopped taking it because I could not handle the sexual side effects. Then when my doctor prescribed it again he told me that it should ALWAYS be taken at night!!! It helps with the drowsiness, which was my 1st problem because I felt like a zombie in the morning when I took it. So when I started taking it at night, I noticed that I STARTED TO HAVE ORGASMS RIGHT AWAY!! Now I take it before bed every night, and I have orgasms all the time! I want everyone to know to talk to your doctor about taking Lexapro at night!! The side effects are non-existent! It saved my life, TAKE IT AT NIGHT!!

I'm no longer angry all the time, I don't have days where I feel like doing nothing but crying or feel like I'm completely empty and it's a struggle to even get out of bed.  I haven't had any suicide thoughts since about the fifth week of being on it.  My mind is a lot more active but it's with positive thoughts instead of angry & sad ones. I feel normal and truly happy for the first time in my life.  Thank goodness for Lexapro.

I'm a person who never takes medication but found myself severely depressed after the death of my mother and needed something to bring me out of the black cloud I found myself in. I was first prescribed Wellbutrin and Effexor both increased my heart rate and blood pressure. I guess third times a charm because Lexapro worked great it was like someone turned a light switch on in my head, I noticed a change within the first week of taking this medicine. I now think more clearly, I have more energy, I don't get upset over the little things, my anger and mood has mellowed out, Co-workers have even commented that I'm friendlier now.
I find that lexapro works better for me when I take it around the same time every day after I've eaten usually around 9:30am after breakfast. Lexapro will make you nauseated if you do not eat before taking. But as for not sleeping or gaining weight as mentioned in other reviews I have actually lost weight because I do more in the day, I don't go home and just sit on the couch any more after work. This is the benefit of taking this medicine early in the morning I accomplish more during the day and when I go to bed I'm naturally tired and fall asleep. I don't plan on being on this medicine for very long but it is working for me when I'm needing it the most."
1811$Depression$12/16/2009 9:50:56 AM$Reviewer: Mojoron, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$5$I had post cardiac bypass depression that was effecting my work and my family.  I tried Lexapro samples for four weeks and while it was effective in the beginning, I became more depressed to the point of crying and sleeping during the day which I never did before.  I immediately got off the drug and feel pretty much OK now.  I believe that I had a Serotonin Storm which is a common problem with taking these types of drugs.  If at all possible, when suffering from clinical depression, try other non-perscription alternatives first.  Try to get more active, exercise more and seek mental support from a mental health professional. Major depression may require this and other drugs for depression

After about three months of regular use, I found myself becoming more easily upset and reactive, with greater tendancy toward flying off the handle. About one month ago, I began tapering off the meds by 1/4 of final dosage per week and found I was sleeping significantly more than while on the meds and oversleeping my alarm more than once. 
1823$Depression$12/10/2009 10:37:03 PM$Reviewer: CLL, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"This website has been SO valuable during my frustration with different medications. You need to read over ALL the reviews and rule out a few that don't seem to jive with all the others.  There's always a few out there who are dissatisfied. That doesn't mean those same things will happen to you.  Do your research and remember, everyone is different and react to drugs differently.  

Don't be scared the first time you see a reviewer mention weight gain or decreased libido.  It's more important that you get to feeling better and you can deal with those things later. 

I've had depression for 30 years and Prozac 20mg worked for me up until I hit 50. Perhaps it was because I'm pre-menopausal or because I'd taken the same drug, at the same dose for so many years.  I went to the doctor and tried several other drugs. At first, I wasn't satisfied with any of them, so I got on Effexor XR.  Wow!  Please read about the withdrawl symptoms when going off of Effexor, because they are severe. Try all the other meds first. Something will work for you.

Bottom line, I'm going back on Lexapro.  I don't think I gave it enough of a chance and it was working pretty well for me. Be patient and don't try to change meds or get off of something without a doctor's advice.  Been there, done that, and it was terrible.  I believe that Lexapro is a wonderful drug. It is sure the best I've tried so far. I believe our bodies get used to something and it finally stops working. That's what happened to me with Prozac, although it was my wonder drug for 20+ years. I'm going to ask my doctor if perhaps I should rotate between Lexapro and Prozac every few years. That may be the answer for me.

DON'T GIVE UP. Antidepressants will help you get your life back, but you have to be patient. Also exercise, eat right, and talk to someone who cares. God bless you all and best wishes in your recovery.

There is light at the end of the tunnel, I promise.

Then you mellow out. Helped me level out my moods. My endurance went down. Stopped running and became more thoughtful. In fact it helped me think more even. The arguements with myself ended. Yes, I was probably a little psycho when I started. I was just fired from my job and it was done by people who were malicious about it. Basically, Lexapro calmed me down and I'm getting on with my life. After extensive consultation with your doctor and therapist I would recommend trying it for three months.

But I was much happier.. not crying all the time and not as anxious. When I switched to 10 mg I was fine all day a little hyper(I take it in the morning) but at night I woke up having a panic attack and tremors. I immediately went back to 5 mg. Another side effect I had was a terrible menstrual cycle. I bled heavily with large clots.. not sure if that is related to the medication or not. Don't think this is worth taking due to the side effects. But everyone's different.

I was feeling more calm and able to handle things.  However, I started having the sexual side effects so I talked to my doctor.  He cut the dose in half and that took care of that problem.  Then I started having severe nausea and dizziness where I felt like the room was spinning.  It would last for about 4 hours every day.  After a few weeks I just couldn't take it anymore.  So I talked to my doctor again and changed meds completely.  I did not gain any weight on Lexapro but I wasn't able to lose any, either even when working out and cutting calories.  While Lexapro helped my depression/anxiety, the side effects were just not worth it.  For those of you having side effects be sure to talk to the doctor.  It may just be a matter of changing the dosage.

1902$Depression$11/9/2009 2:37:34 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Let me first say that for the first 2 weeks, I wanted OFF this, but after a lifetime of no med ever working 4 my depression, I'm SO glad I didn't! I haven't been able to work out of the home for the last 3 years because of my depression/add/pmdd (hopefully that will change) so was able to take the time to adjust. The 1st couple of days I thought I was losing my mind. I'd be crying for ten minutes, then extremely agitated for ten, then ok for ten - press repeat.  Essentially, 1st two weeks didn't feel at all like myself & had severe nausea, sleep problems, you name it including suicidal thoughts (try not to be alone, although I had to). But after having tried no kidding EVERY other drug out there just about with no luck, I was desperate & hung in there, just hoping. 2-3 months into taking 10mg I WAS noticing some improvement but not enough with my anxiety, so my doctor upped me to 20mg. So I had a repeat of the two weeks of hell - after a couple of weeks it was bearable but still wasn't myself for a couple more. Now, while I do still have to fight the depression, at least I feel I can. I can actually usually choose my reactions to stress instead of my reactions choosing me, have spent more time out of bed and actually able to function when my PMDD isn't kicking my butt ten days a month around my period (any suggestions for this?), & have been able to cope MUCH better. BTW, just some of the other drugs I tried (and yes, did give them at least a month or two - didn't have the severe side effects as with the Lexapro, just zombied out): Paxil (never again!), Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor ... there were more I can't remember off-hand, including ones for anxiety/panic attacks.  It had gotten to where I didn't believe in the meds at all before trying the Lex.  Now I wish I'd hung in there before & kept trying until I found one that worked for me. Could have maybe saved me years of grief and a messed-up life. Anyway, REALLY grateful for this drug! Hang in there all & keep trying!

Huge appetite came with it. No interest in sex. Sweating became an issue. I would be sweating and no one else was even hot or warm! Finally decided to go off the drug. I reduced the 5 mg every other day to 1/2 of that every week for about five weeks, now i havent had any for three weeks. I no longer have too much sweating, still no sex drive, tired all day.

1917$Depression$11/5/2009 3:23:34 AM$Reviewer: Iamawesome, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$5$5$I started taking 20mg Lexapro in May 2009. For the first few weeks there was little positive about the medicine. I was very nauseated and had severe headaches. I talked to my doctor and he told me to keep at it. I did and got over the symptoms within a few weeks. After that I quickly noticed positive changes. However, I have gained over 20lbs and have a very tired feeling throughoit the day. Rarely do I have trouble sleeping. When I do not take my medicine for a few days, I become much more irritable and in a bad mood. I also feel quite nauseated, dizzy and these zap like pulses through my body that arent necessarily painful but uncomfortable and dissorienting. My Dad passed away a few months after i started taking this medication and that was quite a test. I felt like I was in control of myself and able to still properly grieve.  Overall, I am quite happy with the results thus far and it is important to keep with it and take it as prescribed.

Once the headache went away, I could tell an AMAZING difference in attitude and feelings.  Husband says I'm finally the ""girl he married"" again.  I'm much happier and things just seem easier. Only problem is that I do notice that if I wait until later in the day to take it (at bedtime), I get irritable in the evenings.  Works better for me if I take it around mid-day."

Some symptoms have become worse and there is a corrolation to daily function & how severe symptoms may be on a given day.  Even with CBT (long-term) my overhwelming sadness is a prevailing, predominant symptom.  The fatigue, lack of interest, etc., I truly try to ""manage"" by just dealing with it trying to move on. Day-by-day, just attempting to get out of ""myself"" more & into the world & change the focus from my feelings to attempting to contribute to the world & others, as I can, day by day.

I would recommend talking to your doctor about taking the lowest dose possible. 10mg & 5mg made me sleepy. 2.5mg worked well so did 1.25mg (cut 5mg pill in 1/4).
Absolute WORST part about this medication is when you stop taking it you will get horrible 'brain zaps'. They are not painful per-say but it is like your brain being electrocuted with the slightest stimuli (light, noise, moving your eyes, turning your head, etc.) Tapering-off lessens the severity of the 'brain zaps' but they will still occur.  I've been off for approx 1yr and will still get these 'brain zaps' once in a while if its really quiet, dark, and I'm tired.
With my husband deploying I've started to take them again but only 1.25mg, just enough to dull the extreme emotions without making me spacey."

I no longer am as obsessive and compulsive about things and am back to feeling happy and outgoing again. The past few years have been very tough for me in life that I reached my end point in July and started taking Lexapro. 

The side effects at first were hard - stomach upset, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. After a few weeks it went away and my body adjusted. Best of all it helped me gain weight finally. Stress in my life the past few years made it impossible for me to want to eat or anything or gain weight. 

I am not sure what is normal bc everyone's bodies are different and will react to every drug different, but lately I have felt a bit more agitated more than usual since I started taking Lexapro. The doctor recommended me going up to 15mg but I am hesitant.

I've been on lexapro for just over 1 yr.  It has certainly ""evened me out"" and I feel that I deal w/ stressful situations on a much more even kiel, but I am tired ALL THE TIME and still have an ""I don't give a crap"" attitude.  I could sleep everyday, all day if I didn't have to work.  I take naps whenever I can.  I definitely have to really pep talk myself to get out of bed everyday.  I'm not nearly as motivated as I used to be to get things done and I have trouble really focusing on things since taking lexapro.  I'm also constantly yawning and have gained at least 15 lbs.  I've also noticed that I have difficulty finding words when I'm talking to people, which never happened prior to taking this drug.  So, I decided to take myself off of it since I'm tired of being tired.  I guess it's withdrawl, but in the few days after I stopped taking it, I get these weird sensations in my head, like shocks or zaps and I find it hard for my eyes to focus when this occurs.  Also, my ears are ringing non-stop.  I really don't want to take this drug anymore, but am affraid the withdrawls are only going to get worse."

As regards weight gain:  The Lexapro, in and of itself, does NOT cause weight gain.  It can, however, increase your appetite, and it lowers your basic resistance, so where once you might have said ""no""... you may very well say ""yes"".

Normal day to day trials no longer are blown out of proportion;  I can deal with things as they come and not worry too much about things that may or may not happen.  One major benefit that contradicts other reviewers reports are that my monthly migraines have subsided substantially.  I no longer need to take anything for them.  I do sleep much better than before lexapro and sometimes have trouble shaking the cobwebs from my head in the morning.  Sexual side effects are gone, libido is back.  I am grateful for this medication - as my husband is too.  I am back to the person I used to be!
2103$Depression$8/25/2009 10:37:36 PM$Reviewer: del295, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$3$5$"A lot of these reviews are suspicious so I decided to write one.
I've been taking Lexapro for over 4 years now, I originally started at 10mg, once per day, I shortened my dose to half a pill every other day due to severe anger problems while taking this medication. I can say it definitely helps with depression, however for me it was very ineffective at helping with OCD issues -- I still have my routines, merely in spurts now.
I do not recommend this medication to anyone unless all other medications for lighter symptoms fail. This drug is very powerful and should not be taken simply because you had a bad day at work, etc. I can vouch for anger issues associated with taking this medication daily, as well as bi-polar behavior and loss of mental focus, lack of feeling real/alive mentally & visually, etc.
I've tried kicking this medication and it is not difficult to get off of, very few withdrawals -- however I suggest cutting the dose gradually rather than going cold turkey.
This medication does not seem to conflict with Propranolol.
Side effects I have experienced are dry mouth, constipation, jittery eyes and erection problems but they are tolerable in comparison to depression.
It is also very expensive, at least $90 without insurance.
If you're on this medication, make sure it works for you and you feel it helps, otherwise find one that actually helps you and do not force yourself to adapt mentally to it."

2113$Depression$8/23/2009 3:35:43 AM$Reviewer: silverado1981, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$5$I took Lexapro for 3 months ans it worked great fro the first month.  Then after I noticed I was like it was not working well almost kept thinking that it was a bad batch of Lexapro.  Then I started to get really depressed like it would work one day and not the next.  Then a little bit more than the last 2 weeks I took it I started to get suicidial thoughts kept popping in my head just randomly more when I was by myself but the even when I would be at work and I would just start thinking about it.  Just before I quit and got onto something else I almost commited suicide and I have never had problems like that before so just be very careful and let your doctor know of any little change.  If I would have had a gun I would be not telling anyone who is reading this now.  Good Luck.

2119$Depression$8/20/2009 11:09:31 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$"I was prescribed Lexapro to treat my depression, and was only on the drug for one week. During that week, my energy level dropped significantly, I could barely stay awake throughout the day and my brain was in a complete fog. I was spaced out and loopy and felt exhausted. It didn't matter whether I took it in the morning or at night, with our without food, the results were the same. I could barely function through a work day, and I probably shouldn't have been driving a car in this state. I didn't cry or feel depressed during the week, but I can't say that I felt much of anything, except strange. I have been off it for 24 hours now, and the difference is amazing. I have my energy back, I'm not loopy and I'm not physically exhausted. I can focus on work tasks again. My doctor has prescribed Cymbalta as the next drug for me to try for treating the depression, which I have not started yet.

I read many positive reviews about Lexapro, and I guess the point of me writing this review is so that people can see that in some cases, this drug is clearly not for everyone. And if you are immediately experiencing some of the less common side effects, talk to your doctor immediately."

But, please be patient and tolerate the first 6 weeks of side effects, I found that to be the norm and subsides as soon as your body adjusts. Coming from my experience of course.

Effexor took away the ""lows"" but is also took away the ""highs"" so that I felt emotionally ""neutral"" all the time. I now take Lexapro 20mg daily and I finally feel like I'm back to my normal self (and I haven't noticed any side effects). It's like I've found the right ""key"" to fit the receptors in my brain. I've been taking Lexapro for 5 yrs and I never want to stop! I consider it a maintenance medication. My advice is keep trying different antidepressants if one doesn't work for you; you just might find the ""key"" to fit your brain receptors. "

My ability to orgasm was ruined by this drug and 9 mos later still no orgasmic ability. Before the drug I was multi-orgasmic. During the drug course no desire for sex at all. I gained about 5 lbs yet my appetite had died and I was not eating. Drank a lot of water when I was awake though! Majorly dehydrated.

It didn't help the depression. My Dr raised the dose and it still didn't help. Soon later I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I never had a problem w/ it before and it was before stopping treatment w/ the lexapro so it wasn't just withdrawl. I have known other people as well who had the same side effects which aren't noted on the drug facts. Now after 7 months of no help I am going to have to remain on thyroid medications for the remainder of my life and continue having blood work done every 3 to 4 months to test my thyroid hormone levels thanks to this drug. I was diagnosed 5 years ago with hypothyroidism. As a teenager, to hear I'd have to be on medicine for the rest of my life because of a medication that didn't present all the facts, I was horrified.

I followed my Dr's advice to go cold turkey, and I ended up in the ER with a BP of 190/124 and a horrible crawling sensation all over my body like I had to keep moving and couldn't hold still. I was stuck in the median on the freeway and it was all I could do to drive to the hospital. I threw up all over my car and was sweating profusely.  The only thing that made the symptoms subside was to go back on it.  I had to taper my dose for 2 weeks to get off it.  My Dr. thought I was full of it and didn't believe that I had an adverse reaction to quitting cold turkey. I would strongly advise against that, despite what your Dr. might tell you. "

Lexapro has been know to unmask bipolar that would otherwise remain hidden. I was prescribed Lexapro 10MG after a move to a new city and promotion. At first it was great and I felt better than I every had before I started on the medication. After 3 or 4 months, I started to feel too good and started displaying signs of hypomania (high part of bipolar). This effected every relationship, both personal and professional in my life, but I didn't care at the time and I stayed on the medication. After I realized that Lexapro had uncovered a hidden hypomania activity, I weened off of it, taking 5MG a day for two weeks then 5MG everyother day. After I was off Lexapro for a month, I returned to major depression that was way worse than the original episode. The good feelings associated with Lexapro are artifical and it commonly will ""unmask"" bipolar activities. I was never aware of this risk and no doctor talked about it untill it was too late. Use with caution, Lexapro had large negative long term effects in my life."

It was the longest period I've had without a major depressive episode. 3 months ago I decided to go off it and see how i did. Unfortunately I did it on my own, with working with my doc, and went off cold turkey. Several weeks later I had a major crash and have been in a depression ever since. I went right back on the lexapro, but unfortunately it no longer works for my depression, even at a higher dose. I had heard that a small percentage of people experience this when going off and back on an anti depressant. So, now I'm going to try a different AD, pristiq and see how that goes.

I didn't want sex. I was so tired of feeling so blaah. So I went to my Dr and told her I couldn't deal with Zoloft any more. She perscribed Lexapro and within a week I was joking around and going places. I am so glad I asked for another antidepssant. I feel a million times better not to mention my relationship has improved dramatically. During my years on Zoloft, I tried a number of other meds like Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Paxil,and one or two more but always had to go back to Zoloft because they either didn't control my depression or made me feel very angry. I love my new med!!!

I am afraid to stop taking it becaue of scary withdrawal stories and from fear that the depression/ anxiety will return. I used to not be able to ride in an elevator without holding my breath and sweating. I found after a few weeks on Lexapro, I can pretty much handle anything without anxiety. My moods are much more stable now also. I am down to taking 5 mg every other day and I think its the perfect dose for me. But if I miss that dose, I get a terrible headache. Negatives- strange dreams, 15 lb weight gain that might have been due to my previous depression. I noticed that when I was taking Lexapro everyday, my resting heart rate was in the 40's! Almost the same as hypothyroidism! That would explain the weight gain. Overall , it seems to be working

After starting Lamictal, my doctor and I decided to take me off of the drug, Lexapro.  He had me take half pills for a week and then stop.  That was a bad idea!  I became extremely dizzy and sleepy! EXTREME, no driving, nothing.  I went to urgent care to see what was wrong and they told me I was having withdrawls.  I went back on Lexapro and I was perfectly fine in 2 days.  My doctor said next time we try taking me off it might be over months, not weeks.  Think about this if you decide to get off.

Didn't like that feeling.  And as someone else posted in having bizaar thoughts, so was I.  Not only bizaar, but bad thoughts.  This was not me at all.  So I weaned myself off, but the blues came back so back to the doctor to get on something else, which I am now on Effexor XR.  She did say something that I thought to be unprofessional which was ""Our grandmothers didn't seem to be having all these problems and just shook it off"".  I'm sorry, yes our grandmothers worked physically harder than we do today, but people in this day and time have a lot more social issues to deal with than our grandparents ever had to.  We are living in a world that keeps going faster and we are trying to keep up with it.  We are a stressed out nation, sad to say.

Achieving an orgasim is impossible 3. on the up-side my thought process has cleared somewhat. I have been reading other reviews about the ""zapped"" feeling you get when you try to quit taking Lexapro. I went through the same thing with Paxil and MY GOD IT WAS HELL!!

2359$Depression$6/8/2009 6:27:03 PM$Reviewer: really lost it!, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I had a devastating reaction to this drug which I reported to the FDA. The side effects grew worse as time went on. On the third week of taking it, I began to experience bizzare thoughts, memory loss (forgot how to use my windshield wipers), lightheaded out-of-body sensations, increased insomnia, compulsiveness and weight gain. By the fourth week, I became psychotic...I made crisis phone calls to strangers, ended friendships, became violent and broke neighbor's windows in addition to trashing my own house, and actually contemplated suicide.  These behaviors are/were totally out-of-character for me and I am absolutely certain the Lexapro caused the behaviors. I really 'lost my mind' on this drug.  It took almost three weeks to wean off this drug, and I was an emotional and mental mess throughout it all. It took a long time for my brain to recover from it, and it added to my depression....

Then I had the misfortune of stepping on a scale, boy was I surprised to find that I had gained 20 lbs on this medicine...which made no sense considering I walk a minimum of 4 miles each day.  I have since been switched to Zoloft & it is working great (without the weight gain).  I hope Lexapro works for some of you, just be careful not to let the weight get as out of control as I did.

Months later, I had moved in with my boyfriend, and would constantly find new girls he was talking to in his phone. I eventually got to the point where I wouldnt want to leave the house, doing fun things was like a chore I had to make myself do. I was contantly anxious and would think up any worse case scenerio I could. I eventually had a breakdown, and had gotten physical with loved ones. Which is extremely outside of my character. I broke down and decided I couldn't live with myself and push any more friends and family away from me anymore. The dr. diagnosed me with severe depression- with mild anxiety. I began on 10mg and three weeks later I was switched to 20mg (because I would still get a little irritated at nite when the meds when begin to ware off). I noticed right away I was beginning to feel better, I started talking to my friends more and just began ""loving"" everyone like I used to. I enjoy going out and being social again. A huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Which is good when you're only 22. I don't dwell on the past anymore and I'm not so in my head and not as angry. I'm more independent.

It will make me space out from time to time when I am alone I relize I have no random thoughts and my mind is at peace.  A stange feeling for someone who is always thinking 2 days ahead. I am hoping to have the same reaction to treatment as last time but I think I will be on it longer than the 8 months this time around. Dealing with my fathers illnes and moving back home to tend to him has put me in a state of depression that I have not felt in many many years, but with the help of this med and other treatment I know I will be out of this depression sooner then I think.

After 3 days I felt as if someone had pressed a reset button and I was back to my normal self.  Every little thing dealing with teenagers no longer makes me crazy. Yawning and headaches disappeared after the first week.  Do do still have a stiff neck, and most disappointing is the inability to reach orgasm, something that was always rather easy to do before.  I will talk to my doctor about this.  Now that I have read many of these reviews I am concerned about stopping lexapro and wonder what I have started.

I finally gave in because I could not get out of bed and when I did, my anger always sent me back to bed.  These meds don't make you indifferent to problems--as my 25 year old son is afraid--they honestly help your true self come out, you know the person you can't believe that others don't see in you. 
2403$Depression$5/25/2009 5:04:52 PM$Reviewer: imightbe, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$"From the age of roughly 10 to 33, I suffered severe anxiety and depression.  I resisted meds until I became absolutely suicidal.  I felt an immediate change within three days of starting Lexapro.  I was very drowsy, nauseous, and my vision was impaired, but that gave way quickly.  However, two weeks later, the beneficial effects disappeared and I experienced a rough drop back into depression, sadness, and anxiety.  Another week later, everything was stabilized, and each month on Lexapro has given me a gradually better quality of mental health.  

It does, however, play havoc with your memory and sex drive.  I still feel unmotivated, but the initial sluggishness I felt at the beginning is slowly evaporating.  I made the proper choice. 

Skipping a dose isn't a problem for a day or two, but withdrawal is very unpleasant.  I recommend very gradual titration if you want to stop taking it for whatever reason."

Lexapro so I tried the 10mg dose.  It took a week or two to feel a change but it definitely works for me.  My wife tells me I'm a lot easier to live with and frankly I feel more comfortable most of the time.  I'm certainly much less depressed than before.  I recommend it for those that reap its benefits.  Like any drug, it's probably not for everyone.  However there are some negative considerations as well.  It's harder to wake up in the morning.  I take naps when I can.  Sometimes I fall asleep reading a book, where I never used to.  Sexual desire is down but not gone.  I don't feel it has inhibited an erection but sometimes reaching orgasm can be difficult.  I guess that's why they make Viagra.  Another thing to consider is, don't miss a dose.  I failed to take it one morning and noticed I was a bit more grouchy than usual that day.  I took it the following day and was so spaced out at work that I hope I never forget to take it again.  I was forgetting people's names I had known for a while.  Familiar things were unfamiliar.  It was scary.  The following days were fine as long as I stay on the drug.  I've heard it was hard discontinuing usage of Lexapro now I believe it.  The positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me."

I understand side effects could fade away as I adjust, so I hope these will not last. I could not deal with them on a constant basis. I took lexapro back in college with amazing results and little to no side effects over time.

It make me extremely drowsy to were I couldn't keep my eyes open during the day and had to drink energy drinks to make it through work. Now I have been on Lexapro for a little over a month and I love it. I couldn't imagine going a day without it. It doesn't make me happy all the time but it certainly levels me out. I feel much more upbeat and positive then I have ever been before in my life. In the beginning, I started taking it at night before bed and I wasn't sleeping well at all. I seemed to have insomnia so I switched to taking it in the morning. It definitely works much better for me to take it in the morning and I sleep well at night now. Overall, it has worked wonders on me. It's not for everybody but it is a trial and error process. If it works for you, stick to it. If it doesn't work for you, try something different.

Well I can and its awful. My best friend was killed by a drunk driver when I was in 7th grade and my freshmen year of high school I was diagnosed with depression. I'm now a sophomore in college and life without lexapro is awful. My roomates, who I've only known for two years, can even see a difference in me when I miss my medication for more than a week. There has never been a downside for me taking this drug, I've never had any of side effect and it has greaty improved my life. I'm happier all the time and have more energy and want to get out and do things. I guess the only bad thing about it is when I miss for like over a week (which is rare but happens) there is a drastic swing in my mood and its clear to me and everyone around me. I am a totally different person when I dont take the drug. I'm afraid that I am dependant on it, and although I dont want to be on Lexapro my whole life, I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

2523$Depression$4/16/2009 6:06:40 PM$Reviewer: drtobe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on Lexapro for a year and have been very pleased with the results.  Take it for depression/anxiety combo.  Started out on Lorazepam for anxiety attacks, but quickly realized I needed a daily medication.  Had used Xanax for a short period a few years ago, but I like the Lexapro because it isn't habit forming (I'm sure there are withdrawal symptoms, but it isn't addictive).  Started at 10mg, which worked fine until I was laid-off earlier this year, so I switched to 20mg.  Doing fine on 20mg and plan to stay.  Lexapro has made a huge difference in my life - I used to have trouble sleeping, was disinterested in life in general, often wondered what the point of living was, and would constantly worry about EVERYTHING.  I felt improvement of my depression within 1 week of receiving the prescription.  A word on side effects:  I too felt EXTREME fatigue, nausea, terrible headaches, and lack of appetite in the first couple of days.  I was taking it in the morning before going to work and I honestly felt AWFUL within an hour of taking it - but the depression was getting better so I hung in there with the medication, figuring the side effects would go away once my body adjusted to the medication.  I also switched to taking the medication at night right before I went to bed instead of in the morning, so any side effects would occur while I was sleeping and I didn't feel them as much.  Thankfully making that switch did the trick and as far as I know the side effect went away after the first week or so.  Give it time if you're just starting or thinking about starting.

Now I have been taking 20mg for over 2 years and it does wonders for me. I am more even-tempered and don't have the anxiety/panic attacks. Sometimes I still struggle with stressing about things but not like I did before. I can finish a thought and think clearly. It has improved my memory (I have a really bad memory-some short term and long term)and I am able to function much better daily. I did have sexual side effects for a long while but after so long those seemed to dissolve as well. I wish I could tell everyone who needs help about this and how it has helped me. There's nothing more relieving than to be able to function everyday on a normal basis. I would recomment atleast trying this medication.

The sadness and worthlessness are gone. I can actually get up and do things, and I actually like myself for once. The panic and anxiety I usually feel happen a lot less. So in those areas, the drug works. However, the sadness and worthlessness have been replaced by what can only be described as, whatever. I just don't care anymore. And it's not like, oh nothing is worth it, I don't care anymore. It's simply not there emotion-wise. It's like everything is blank. Blank and a little foggy at times. On top of that, I started overeating. Full, or not, I'm constantly hungry and have to stop myself from eating all day long. I also have a slight ringing in my ears sometimes. So I have mixed feelings on this drug.

2576$Depression$3/27/2009 3:03:07 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$1$5$I was put on this medicine for Depression, Anxiety, and feelings of complete and total Anger. Since I have been on it, I have noticed that I have begun having Suicidal thoughts which is not like me. I am on 20mg and my OB/GYN put me on Xanax after about 5 months to help with the severe anger issues that were still coming up. Taking this medication scared me and made me feel like there was something seriously wrong with me. I also noticed that my Depression got alot worse and I didn't know how to deal with it. I was just taken off the medication by a psychologist and I am on something that I am praying will help me since I don't feel like anything else will.  Be very careful when you are taking this medication and don't wait as long as I did to tell your doctor if your problems get worse or if new ones pop up.

The side effects that I have experienced are the reason I will stop taking this medicine today! Side effects for me include dry mouth, headache, sleepyness, muscle aches and worst of all DIARREHA! It's so bad it's to the point of perhaps 10 times a day. It seems I can't go anywhere or do anything without the need to have a portolet behind me at all times. I'm not depressed though. Overall the side effects aren't worth the the trouble. Without health insurance it is way expensive too. Luckily I got samples from my Dr. so I'm not out the money.

It made me feel ""normal"" again.  I felt like I was made whole again.  It allowed me to have emotions, but I was in control of them and could deal with them appropriatly.  The two very unfortunate side effects to this medicine were severe weight gain.  I was 118 and am now 147.  I gained this much weight in a matter of just seven months.  I finally requested to go off this medicine and have been off it now for two weeks with no weight loss yet.  The other very serious thing that occurred with me is that my sodium level dropped severly low and the doctors thought my addrenal gland was failing.  It was only after a great number of tests that they realized it was the Lexapro that was causing my low sodium levels.  I was so low, I was put on anti seizure medicine and was also at risk for stroke.  I would be cautious in recommending this medicine to people."

My depression has lifted somewhat, as I felt I was always on the verge of tears, but I am very tired. I need a nap during the day, and I am not motivated to do much.  My doc said it din't matter if I took it in the morning or at night.  I think I will switch to taking it at night to see if I am more awake during the day  - however, night sleeping has been good.  I specifically asked for a drug that would NOT put weight on  - too soon to tell about that, but I seem to be less hungry during the day  - maybe I'll be one of the lucky ones who actually lose!!  However, this is apparently a pretty powerful drug, efective or not, so I'd be careful with starting or stopping it.

2613$Depression$3/15/2009 7:00:51 PM$Reviewer: uGODio, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"I was prescribed this drug after my father passed away last year as a ""boost"" to the Wellbutrin I've taken for several years.  The side affects I experienced at the beginning were nausea, headache, dizziness, tiredness, etc - the usual. I stopped & started the Lexapro several times due to the side affects.  However, I found if I gave it more time (at least 2 weeks) it worked wonderfully with the Wellbutrin.  Especially for anxiety.  The only pitfall I experienced was a very decreased libido and lack of orgasm.  This placed stress on my marriage.  I weighed the cost & once again stopped taking it after a few weeks. It has now been about 3 months off the drug and I'm having anxiety almost everyday.  I know I need something to supplement the Wellbutrin & the Lexapro did wonders except for the libido.  It's quite possible I didn't hang on long enough to see if that symptom subsided as well.  I most likely will go back on it since the overall result was positive and helped me to feel more like my old self.  After all, it is about the one taking the medication - to ward off the anxiety and depression, right?  Therefore, in my opinion if you can get past the initial onset of side effects, Lexapro is a winner! Side note for another writer - Wellbutrin works when you don't even realize it.  Try going off it & see if others don't notice."

I have always believed that suicide is a selfish act that is no less evil than murdering another human being.  In spite of this, I tried to end my own life.  It was my first and last attempt.  I lost my friends, I scared my family, and I had to drop out of school because I was put on stay of commitment.  While I was in the hospital watching TV I saw an ad urging people to sue the drug companies if they or someone they knew tried to kill themselves while on certain medications.  Lexapro was one of them.  I had been put on this drug to lower my depression, when in fact it just increased the probability that I would try to kill myself.  The meds I'm taking now work a hundred times better, and I have no desire to kill myself whatsoever.

Zoloft worked for a while, but eventually I needed pretty  high daily doses.  Parnate (a MAOI) worked very well, but it comes with too many restrictions and adverse interactions with other drugs. Lexapro combined with Wellbutrin has worked extremely well for more than 2 years and this treatment has helped me find a real stable place with ups and downs, but no dramatic swings in either direction. With other drugs I found that after a while I was confident I could handle it myself, only to find a deeper depression when I stopped meds and resistence to the same meds for treating the new episode.

As far as the efficacy for treating anxiety Ive noticed little to no improvement but after adding 15mg of Buspar/Buspirone thats also improving. I was told to take it in the morning do to that fact that antidepressants can have the potential for keeping you awake if taken later in the day. I did and I think still do experience a really dry mouth and is necessary to drink water frequently.

Most doctors do not warn patients about SSRI DISCONTINUATION SYNDROME, so please research this before deciding that Lexapro is right for you.

Lexapro was fairly effective at easing my depression, but every time I missed a dose, I felt sick.  Because of this, and the sexual side effects (complete inability to orgasm, no arousal during sex, no interest in sex), I decided to switch to Wellbutrin, and let me tell you, DISCONTINUING LEXAPRO IS HELL.  PLEASE, please before taking Lexapro, look up SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome on Wikipedia. It has been over a month since I finally tapered off Lexapro, and I have felt sick the whole time.  It's like having the flu every day but it doesn't go away, and the feeling of being ""zapped"" every few minutes is VERY disconcerting.  I am only JUST starting to feel better, however I still get major headaches every day, I feel like I have a low-grade fever and my body still hurts most of the time.  
If you do take Lexapro, DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY. TAPER OFF VERY SLOWLY to lessen the very unpleasant effects of discontinuing it.  My doctor had me taking 50mg/day, which sounds like a lot, but it took that much to be effective for me. But nobody warned me that I would have to take it the rest of my life or suffer the misery of discontinuing it. 
Lexapro can be a very effective medication, and the benefits of taking it can outweigh the problems it may cause, so do the research and make an educated decision based upon your personal needs.
Keep in mind that WebMD is sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, so you probably won't find anything about SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome here unless you are reading what patients have submitted.  
Please research carefully and thoroughly so that you understand exactly what you are getting into if you do decide to take Lexapro.  "

I was feeling better than when off medication but not really myself.  I finally went to a psychiatrist (much better than PCP) and am now on a combination of lexapro and wellbutrin.

I have a more optimistic view, things don't seem so overwhelming and I have much less anger.  Others around me have noticed as well.  It has really changed my life.  I was very sad, very depressed, very irritable.  I can still get down, but things don't seem so hopeless now.  After a couple weeks I felt a slight difference, after a little more than 3 a big difference.

The first 2-3 weeks I experienced nausea and stomach cramps, but these went away completely. My mood is much better and I am able to enjoy life again. The side-effects I've had are drowsiness, disruption in sleep patterns, weight gain, difficulty achieving orgasm. 

I take it in the morning and get very sleepy around 2-3PM. I tried taking it other times. When I took it in the evening, it was very difficult to wake up in the morning. Other times of day I had trouble remembering it. Sometimes I've had issues with insomnia; inability to sleep until 3-4AM but this was rare.

I've put on about 30 lbs. since I've been taking Lexapro. I was too skinny before, so this hasn't been a real problem.

The sexual side effects are a nuisance. An understanding (and creative) partner can help there."

I have taken this for 2 1/2 years and have faired well.  It doesn't cause a ""cloudy"" effect in the brain, but takes the edge off of stressful situations.  I have now been switched to another medication.  I have reached a point that it doesn't help me any longer and for the past year have been fatigued and rapidly gaining weight.  With any medication, your body just doesn't respond like it used to, so I have now switched to another medication. My suggestion is 1 to 1 1/2 years maximum on this medication."

I just took myself OFF of Lexapro because it has left me feeling like a zombie.  I can't get off the couch & my anxiety builds as I watch things around my home pile up because I'm not getting anything done.  The side effects from going off this medication are scary to say the least. I feel like 1 lady who posted w/one of my withdrawls from this med. Small brain seizures (as if someone is startling me), headache, shaky, super rapid heart beat and when I move my body I feel as though I tingle all over and that I am going to fall down. It's as though I cant control what my body is doing.  I used Lexapro for depression, migraines, extreme pain & panic attacks after my ex-husband tried to kill himself. The coward tried to kill himself when I caught him cheating 4 times in 6 months while he was out of town working. I had my beautiful 2 year old son with me when all of this happened & I just fell into such a deep depression because he didnt stop the damage to our family with the suicide attempt, he ruined us financially, tried to get full custody, let our truck get repoed while I had our son at the grocery store and the list goes on.  I went through several antidepressants and this one had the least amount of side effects.  I feel as though I built up a resistance to it because I just didn't want to do anything anymore.  Thus, I took myself off of it and the withdrawls are terrible.  I really want to try and change my diet & exercise to balance out my body and it's chemical makeup.  I hope the things I am feeling now go away within a couple of days because I am even afraid to drive my car.  I just feel like someone is shaking me and my body is tingling.  Best of luck to all of you that are trying to get healthy and I hope there comes a day when doctors stop pushing pills for everything.  ebaydeals07 at yahoo dot com.

I took Lexapro for 11 years after the death of my son and husband.  Got tired of taking it and AMA, I weaned myself off it a little tiny bit at a time.  I actually shaved down the tablet over 4 months until there was nothing left.  Side effects were ""brain freeze"", delayed vision, nausea, headache, feeling like I was falling backwards, and other minor ones.  I put my friends and employer on notice and they helped out a lot.  If you decide to withdraw, do it very, very slowly and watch for the side effects.  They disappear over time.  I've been off 2 years now and I'm fine.  I cry but I prefer that to not feeling anything. On the other hand, Lexapro helped me get through the roughest thing I'll ever experience.  I could not have done it without help and Lexapro stabilized me enough that outside professional help was possible."

I tried Zoloft for about a year, but it didn't help me much, and when I stopped taking it, my depression became more severe. Lexapro has proven itself much more effective, in my case. It's easy to use because you can take it anytime in the day, as long as you're somewhat consistent with at what time of day you take it. The only major problem that I have experienced is decreased energy. I become tired just a few hours after awakening and feel the need for sleep at a much earlier time. Other than that, I have felt more confident, less pessimistic, and much less anxious while being on Lexapro.

Also, after discontinuing this drug I was completely exhausted and weak for several days.  Maybe my experience with this drug is uncommon, but I still believe this drug is too dangerous to be on the market.  I would not recommend it to anyone!!!  (It should be noted that all my tests the prior year were negative including complete lab work and a nuclear stress test.  I am 54 years old with no known prior medical conditions.)

When i first stated it i felt very ""weird"", i was always dizzy, and my head hurt. This all went away after a while but the medicine never seemed to help really help me.  I was alwys tired and still sad only i no longer cared i was sad. Nothing bothered me, i was like a brick wall.  I decided to stop the medicine, but instead of talking to my doctor about it i just stopped taking the medicine.  DO NOT DO THIS!!! My emotions went out of control, i was dizzy, had nausea, a headache theat would not go away, and was shaky.

The first side effect I began to notice was stiffening of muscles followed by joint pains.  I've now been off the drug for about 2 months and the joint pains haven't gotten any better.  I feel it prominently in the bones of my knees and elbows.  Beyond that, while on Lexapro, I had lowered sex drive, increased appetite, dizziness, and slight drowsiness, all of which discontinued upon stopping usage.  Withdrawal symptoms included vomiting, dizziness, confusion (at work), and a light head feeling.  The drug did alright while I was on it but the negative effects it caused in me didn't come close to outweighing the positive effects.

It negatively affected my job because I was so tired all the time and I would often sleep right through my alarm clock. Even though there are no noticeable effects as far as weight gain goes, I was so exhausted that I never felt like exercising and ultimately gained a small amount of weight. Excessive yawning, although not a major side effect, was a noticeable side effect as well as sever night sweats.

My pychiatrist said lexapro works well for that.  when i first took, there were no real differences.  I was more outgoing so I guess the depression part worked. I woul still get anxious in social situations but I could handle it alot0  better. what was interester though was that I kept waking up at night. I got a sleep study done and they found i awoke 20 times during REM sleep, DR said it's not normal because at that stage the body is paralyzed, He thought the Lexapro was causing the disruptions....so if anyone has problems staying asleep at night, talk to your doctor because I would be fallin asleep at my desk since I would wake up at least 5 different times through out the night....

It worked for me immediately. I am totally satisfied after being on it 4 months. I feel human again and only wish I had started taking it years ago.

I definitely notice some of my old symptoms of depression & anxiety coming back. However, I will gladly take the headaches and go back to Lexapro if Effexor XR doesn't deliver.

Now after being on only 10mg for about 6months now I am not very happy with it.  I am still somewhat moody (nothing like I was though).  The aspect that I am extremely unhappy with is that is with no change in diet and exercise I have packed on about 25lbs.  The biggest I have ever been!!  I do not mind gaining a few pounds to feel better but this is a little extreme and if I continue on the medication what will happen?  Not to mention I am on 100mg of Topamax which a side effect of this is usually weight loss.

I took Effexor for three years and had serious sucicidal thoughts which i never acted on, i had dreams that were seriously real to me, and Effexor affected my daily routine. Since making a switch to Lexapro, i have never felt better. I have been happy, like i havent felt in years, i dont feel sick when i miss a dose, and I feel like a totally new person, the way i act and the way i react are completley new lifestyles to me, and i feel Great! If you are in situations similar to mine i highly suggest talking to your doctor about trying Lexapro and if your taking another medicine, consider making the switch like i did, it was the best thing i have done for myself in the past five years!

I went on Lexapro and the first 3-4 weeks were terrible.  I was more depressed and anxious than ever.  After that fourth week, I literally felt like I woke up and discovered myself again.  I felt like me again, and didn't recognize how bad the depression was until the lexapro kicked in.  I still can feel all emotions, sadness, anger, etc. They just don't consume my life and the anxiety is around only when it truly is warrented.

My depression and anxiety have increased in that time apart from the first couple of days in which I felt great (placebo effect perhaps), but that may be due to occurances over the last couple of weeks which would probably affect anyone adversely. I'm hoping over the next few weeks, things will improve. It's too early to make a proper judgement on the med. My anger has increased also. These may not necessarily be caused by Lexapro.

We came across Lexapro and we decided to try it. This pill made me lose weight. Not because it made me nausiated, but because it made me bounce off the walls. I was so hyper on this pill! I had energy up the you know what! The downside of this was that if I missed a day, it would be like a bad crash and burn after an energy drink, and it would take my body 2 to 3 days to reboot back to normal. Also, when I would crash and burn by missing a dose, I would also get horrible headaches, like someone who drinks caffeine constantly and just goes off of it cold turkey.

I wanted to die. I had fits of rage. My husband has PTSD long term .I started taking 10 mg Lexapro daily. It really pulled me out of the anger and depression . The dose ws increased to 20 mg.My suicidal and homicidal thoughts went away. Nothing bothered me. I literally became numb emotionally, just like my husband.I could not cry. After the dose was raised to 20mg,I had palpitations and chest pain, pressure. I went to the Dr. He said if these symptoms returned to call. These side effects subsided.  I experienced the fatigue, it passed. The worst side effect I've had is severe joint pain. I thought I could handle it, I was afraid of my depression returning. I decreased the dose  to 10mg. This didn't reduce the joint pain and swelling.My last dose was Sept. 18.I am 61 years old. My concern is that the drug has placed me into the possibility of having permanent arthralgia, arthritis.

I had severe stress in my life which lead to extreme depression. When I first started to take this medication at full dose 10mg I was constantly in the bathroom, had a lot of bloating, and had gas all the time. I went back to my doctor and we dropped the dose to 1/2 a pill a day instead of the full 10mg. I just cut the pill in half. That stopped all of the above symptoms. I am able to focus better on this it has helped with my depression and I have even lost weight taking this, about 15lbs. Which is awesome.  This medication has helped me get back on track and lesson my anxiety as well. I recommended it to a friend as well and she could tell it helped her out in a few days as it did to me. I've been on Zoloft before and that took months to take effect and even then that did not seem to help as Lexapro did in just a few days. My drinking has also been cut back because of Lexapro. I used to crave alcohol a lot now I may have a drink here and there. This drug has really helped me a lot.

3180$Depression$9/25/2008 9:22:09 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$I was put on 20mg of Lexapro for depression and anxiety.  For the first week, give or take, I had very minor nausea, but it went away.  I also noticed myself yawning a lot, and gradually I became more and more tired, which likely was made worse by the trouble sleeping I had.  I also noticed some sexual side effects.  After about a month, I really noticed positive changes in my mood, but the tiredness continued.  If it wasn't for that, I would be very happy with this drug.  My doctor has reduced my dose to 10mg a day, which I've been on for about a week.  I haven't noticed a big change in mood or tiredness yet, but I think both have decreased slightly.

I finally realized about 2 months ago, after ending a mentally abusive relationship, that I couldnt do it on my own. I needed help. I started taking Lexapro. I first took the 10mg and noticed an immediate change in how I felt. I then had to be bumped up to the 20mg and never looked bakc after that. This is an amazing mediacation.

Since then, I have not had that problem.  Don't get me wrong, I still deal with being sad and upset sometimes, but that is life.  Overall, this drug worked miracles for me.

I've been on it about 3 months and it started working right away. I took St. John's Wort before this, which was not strong enough. Then I took 5HTP which worked better for me. But due to some bad life stress, I needed something even stronger. Prozac worked well for me years ago, but my body became tolerant to it. I wanted to try something different. Had a few side effects with Prozac, but no side effects with Lexapro. It balances out my  moods. It is expensive though because there is no generic available in the USA and my insurance won't cover it. So eventually I may try to just go back to using 5HTP, in addition to non-medical ways to reduce stress.

3222$Depression$9/10/2008 4:29:02 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$3$"I have been taking Lexapro for about 5 weeks.  Overall, I would say that it has definitely helped me with depression.
The main reason I am writing this is that I experienced strong anxiety, bordering on panic attacks, for the first couple of days that I was taking the drug.  My doctor was skeptical that this was possible so quickly - one of the main reasons he prescribed Lexapro specifically was due to the relatively low incidence of major side effects.  
I just want to make sure that anyone else who experiences a similar reaction initially knows that it is not just them.  The major anxiety went away for me after a couple of days.  I have had some degree of a lot of the side effects listed (dry mouth, stomach issues, some decrease in sex drive, etc.) but they have dissipated over time.
With Lexapro, counseling, and some changes that I made in my life, I have been able to go from being pretty depressed most of the time (to the degree of having borderline suicidal thoughts) to feeling fairly close to normal.
So just some encouragement that though some people may have more difficulty getting started on the drug than they are led to expect, it has been worth it in my experience."

It helped my depression but has its drawbacks.  Weight gain, no libido, occasional depression(not as bad), fatigue.  I'm going to see if my Dr. can prescribe something else because I've started have short anxiety bouts, palpitations. I don't think that's normal.
3227$Depression$9/8/2008 11:58:48 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$"This was given to me for depressive disorder, I have been on it for 3 months and overall I feel good.  A few draw backs that people need be made aware of that I was not until after I began treatment.  
1. Sexual side effects for me have been horrible-  I have NO sex drive now  
2. I am tired all the time. 
3. In 3 months I have gained over 20 pounds. 
If you are willing to possibly give up sex, be tired most of the time and gain weight- then this is a great anti-depressant.  
Nothing bad to say about the effectiveness- just the side effects add a whole new load of issues to deal with."

It does make you tired, so I make sure to take it in the evening-not morning-works much better.  It works great for anxiety especially, very calming but not drugged feeling. It is very expensive and my insurance doesn't cover the cost, so I have my doctor write a perscription for 20 mg pills (same price as 10mg) and I just take half a pill (10mg). That has cut my monthly cost in half ($40 mo instead of $80). Very difficult to stop taking....it takes months to reduce the dosage and taper off of the medication, still unpleasant."
3234$Depression$9/4/2008 3:27:47 PM$Reviewer: Devorah,  Female $3$3$4$"I am  unsure yet of my experience with this medication as I just started on it. I also take a medication for mirgaines, so I must be careful what I use. My last migraine lasted 70 days and as a result my coping skills were depleted hence the lexapro. There is a side story here, but I shant go into it. I have not experienced weight gain just the opposite I have no appetite. I have been told no wheat gluten as it will increase the chances of a migraine and I also have just recently been told I have cysts on the left side of brain that need to be removed  hence the cause of the mirgaine. When it rains it pours does it not. I am sensitive to meds so my options are limited. 
But you all are so very strong and will get through this. I have read many of your comments and what I hear from all of you is there is strength in your voices. And you share your stories here with each other so people like me come along and read them and we do. We take strength from your words and your perserverence and admire your willingness to shre with strangers. Thank you all. I wll say a prayer that all of you find hope in the sharing. 
I never join these kinds of things but I do not know what is happening to me and I feel like I am standing on the outside of the world looking in on everyone else. I have never been sick broke my neck once but I came back from that with Gods help and my friends and family. I am the strong one for others, how do I be strong for myself? God bless all of you. Be well one day at a time, Chersih you life today and now. Devorah"

No instant fix but give hope that this will be what works for me. I Like the tiredness side effect because i have trouble falling & staying asleep. Weight gain is a major concern as I have worked hard to lose and keep it off, but will continue to eat right and excercise and watch the scale. No other side effects have been experienced. Its a trade off concerning meds, but sometimes what you need to make you feel better is your attitude and constant check in with yourself, There are no instant fix me drugs out there. It all must work together but feeling less overwhelming depression is the goal to effective decision making.Important to work with your Dr. be honest and do not follow your own advice as far as how much you need or dont.You need to work together on this, their medical knowledge is what you pay for. Have tried many different drugs for depression but this one is so far so good. Hang in there.

I took 10mg, once daily.  I felt better after just 2 doses, more energy, less depressed.  The first dose caused nausea, so I took it with some juice and yogurt the second time and had no nausea.  Then the next night I woke to shortness of breath and chest pains.  After a trip to the ER, they determined I had a rare (like affects less than 1% of population) side effect of a severe panic attack.  I had never experienced anxiety to that extreme or a panic attack, so it scared the living crap out of me.  I was advised to stop taking it immediately and after 24 hours, I had no more anxiety or jittery feelings.  I feel like Lexapro would have really helped my depression if it wasn't for that side effect.  I'm apprehensive about taking anything else right now and have been trying vitamins and supplements to help with my depression.  However, I think I'll be talking with my doctor to try a different antidepressant...

I have few or no side affects. I take my pill every morning around the same time and my day is brighter. The only side affect I notice and its only cuz I have been taking it for 2 weeks is I get unpredictably tired. I can sleep at night 5-8 hours, and during the day, I want a nap for a few hours. Other than that...no problems. I have not been as depressed or anxious since starting this medication.

I have a potentially stressful job, and found myself weighed down by worry and fear.  Unable to get out of bed some days, because I knew I had to go to work.  Began taking Lexapro about 7 months ago and noticed a definite improvement after about a month.  Had to abruptly stop during a two-week insurance mix up, and felt extremely dizzy until I got back on.  Currently taking 20mg a day, in the morning before bed (I work midnights).  I have some trouble falling asleep, and more trouble getting up, but overall I feel much better.

Its effects have changed over the years. I started off with very vivid dreams making sleeping an adventure! I didnt mind it actually.
I went up to a max 20mg per day dose and my partner said i was a little more spaced out then, but not really noticeably. 
Im now back down to 10mg and over the last year or so have started to experience severe night sweats, im absolutely drenched in sweat and wake up most mornings feeling very tired, drained and dehydrated. I thought it may be a relation between the drug and my hormonal cycle. There seems to be some correlation between it and the time of the month.
I hate the sweats but i dont want to stop the drug because im scared of how i will cope without it.
I also see the trouble people have with other drugs, Lexapro seems to be the best available at the moment.
What im curious about is...how does the drug make you sweat more? What is the chemistry behind it? Does anyone know?"

When I was younger it worked fine, but once I was taken off of it I had a couple of relapses. I was put back on it and it did not seem to work as well.  With this medicine you can become somewhat immune to its effectiveness after time. I also had issues falling asleep and was prescribed ambien to go along with it.  Lexapro and Celexa are best suited for younger individuals, and the side effects are less severe. I would recommend this product for younger individuals but with more severe cases I would not.

I noticed an the uplifting feeling very fast and I lost a few pounds at first and even though I have a less of an appetite, I eventually gained weight--a good 15 lbs or so. I am very tired a lot, to the point of falling asleep at work if I don't get up and move around! I do sleep better for the most part and do not worry and cry nearly as much! I will probably stop taking it because of the weight issue.   I started taking the birth control Seasonale about 2 months into taking Lexapro, so I will stop taking that to see if that was cause of weight gain before I stop taking Lexapro.

On the first day of taking my medication, I noticed a slight beneficial difference in my mood and anxiety level. As of now, I have only had 3 side effects which are insomnia, a slight lump in my throat (which may be from the antibiotic I'm taking), and increased sweating. I believe the medication is working because I don't worry as much and I feel happier than I have in a long time. Anyone else that has experienced a lump in their throat please let me know. It does not effect my breathing or anything, but it just feels kinda strange. I haven't been able to sleep the past two nights, but I was able to take a good nap. I would also like to know if anyone had trouble sleeping like I did and how long it took for the insomnia to go away. So far I would say I'm fairly satisfied with this medication now that I'm not stressing about the little things.

It ended up I switched doctors and I stayed on both a while then stopped the Lexapro because the wellb. gave me more energy.  I didn't realize over time that I'd become less able to think clearly or calmly.  I was shaking, trembling at times.  Bursts of anger and panic attacks, mad at the world and going over and over bad things that happened and really everything got to me.  I just last week returned to using the Lexapro.  Starting on 10 mg and this doctor said to go to 20 mgs.  At first I was dizzy and sort of sleepy, but I also was calmer and got things done.  I was having trouble leaving the house.  Now I get ready and go!  I can concentrate better and I'm getting so much more accomplished.  I sleep better and feel like I'm in a good mood, actually a little perky and much more outgoing.  I was on lexapro for about a year before the wellbutrin was introduced and it really helped in quitting smoking, but I now see I should have stopped the wellbutrin and stayed on my Lexapro.  It's expensive on my RX plan $50 a month but I feel convinced it is well worth it.  If anyone know when the generic will come out, let me know!!!!!  Thank you for listening!"

I'm on it to treat depression/anxiety. It has worked really great for me. The only side effect that I have had is some weight gain, and general tiredness. Overall it has helped my depression immensely, and about half of my anxiety problems. The only downside is the weight gain, but some general dieting and exercise really help to take care of that. (I hear exercising helps with depression some too.)

I was like a zombie and had people telling me I had no emotions. I experienced weight gain big time on this drug, along with not sleeping and being tired all the time. I started weening it out of my system 2 months ago and I feel so much better. if you are looking to go on this drug please go and type in side effects from lexapro in your browser and you will be shocked at what you will find. I love webmd, but all the side effects are not listed here.

I was also having social anxiety, although I had been suffering from this most of my adult life and didn't know it. I quit crying all the time and quit having feelings of guilt and self worthlessness. Made me VERY tired all the time. I couldn't cry if I tried. Doctor changed me to Zoloft after 6 weeks because I gained 26 lbs. in 6 weeks. Other than the weight gain I would reccomend it.

Initally it helped a lot, but after being on it for about a year I and my family notice a change in me and a decline in effectiveness. I would even say it turned against me. I gained a lot of weight (30+ pounds) and I became more severly depressed. I even found myself thinking I couldn't live this way. That scared me to death. I quit taking it. My new boyfriend and family said they noticed in a week after quiting that I was a different, happier woman. Since quiting it I was fine and did loose the weight. That was the clincher. I have seen and heard from other patients similar stories in my work in the medical field. I would not recommend it. I felt the side effects were worse than the depression I felt. Please seek help though. This is my opinion only. There are many options.

I bumped up to 20mg with no change in depression.  I also have gained about 10lbs since bumping up to 20mg.  Now mind you, I work out 6 days a week, and run 3 days a week.  I shouldn't be gaining weight.  An average person might gain alot more.  ( As a woman I know we research the weight gain part of meds.) Also, lexapro is a very mild medication, and only takes the edge of MDD.  I am supposed to take stronger meds but hate the zombie and weight gain effects.  In conclusion, I am not sure if their IS ANY help for this condition.  Side effects can further the depression.

Started out on 10mg every day.  It felt like too much, I was a zombie.  I've cut back to 1/2 a 10mg pill every other day.  It's perfect.  Just enough to take the edge off and I have a bit more energy and motivation.  I had no motivation to do anything except lay on the couch or read in my bed.  I took Prozac for 7 years and have been off it for 4 years.  Felt I needed something, but not as drastic as Prozac.  Lexapro is working for me.  The weight gain was a huge issue with Prozac.  I gained about 75 pounds.  I am making a conscious effort on the Lexapro.

I stopped taking it for a while and gradually noticed a difference, re-started on it and immediately (overnight, actually) felt better.  If you need it, it's better to stay on it.

However, the insomnia, weight gain, and negative effect on my libido are unacceptable side effects and are profound indeed.  In order to get regular sleep, I had to be prescribed a sleep medication and absolutely could NOT fall asleep without it (despite many attempts); I am quite proud of a major weight loss, but, after taking Lexapro, I gained quite a bit back--absolutely unacceptable; being quite vivacious and alive, I found that while taking Lexapro, my libido had drastically declined.

But, the general consensus of the three of us is that i have characteristic (in my blood & bone, born with it) depression and anxiety. So they said: ""Go with Lexapro"". I have been on it for a little more than a month now. I think it's working. My anxiety has subsided. I used to have these feelings of loneliness, despair quite often and easily triggered. I still get anxious and lonely but not as frequently and i do not  start feeling as hopeless. The first week on this pill i could not sleep, now i can barely get out of bed in the morning. But it is a kind of nice sleepy feeling, very relaxed and comfy. Strange. I have always sweated a lot, with wet stains underarms. Now it is even worse. But, i swear, it does not bother me as much, i kind of look at it more calmly, without panicking and running to change the shirt. Funny. So, Lexapro is working for me pretty decently, but i certainly do not want to be taking it forever, and i hope to not get bad withdrawal symptoms."

I started taking 10mg, along with The Patch to help me quit smoking. After a couple of weeks, and the Lexapro began to take it's full effect... I soon discovered that the two of them did not interact very well together. I ended up passing out from it. 
My Dr took me off the patch, purged my system from everything, increased my dosage to 20mg/day...
Lexapro has helped me a great deal... I am back to work, with a better attitude, no thoughts of suicide, all is going well again.
If I forget to take my meds before I go to bed (once in a while), I definitely can feel it. Or if I forget to call in my perscription and I'm off of the meds for a couple of days, I start getting the chest pains, become very agitated, irritable, and I begin to feel depressed again. So I do recommend Lexapro, and I do recommend that you don't forget to fill your perscription. If it helps you and you see and feel that it has improved you... and made you feel better than what you were feeling before you started taking it... keep taking Lexapro as a maintenance. It really does work.

I hope this helped. "

I had severe nausea for the first week and could barely keep food down. However, it was completely gone after that and I felt grea. My anxiety is almost gone and I am much more laid back. I also don't feel any symptoms of depression & feel better than ever. I recommend it!
3514$Depression$4/19/2008 11:00:26 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$2$I started Lexapro this past November after a suicide attempt. After about a month I felt wonderful and as an added bonus I had no appetite so I was losing a bit of weight. However I fooled myself into thinking that I didn't need it and stopped taking it cold turkey. DO NOT DO THIS!! I became depressed and suicidal once again. If you feel that it is time to discontinue use please talk to your doctor!! I am now back on it and feeling somewhat better. Live and learn I suppose. A few drawbacks are mild dizziness and nausea and a major one is NO sex drive but perhaps in time it will pass.

Within 4 days I landed in the ER with a diagnosis of ""acute drug reaction Lexapro"" and they were peeling me off the ceiling.  Never before did I have such horrible thoughts... of homicide, suicide, insanity or unreality.  These neurologists should have had their licenses pulled, and this drug should never be prscribed unless by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist and only after proper testing and full evaluation for 'depression'.  I've never been depressed a day in my life, thank goodness, and I'll never again accept an anti-depressant from any so-called 'doctor'.

Was doing 20mg, then 10mg after side effects became unbearable.  Lex does help even things out emotionally, and sometimes to excess, but oh the side effects!!  I had insomnia, weight gain, jaw clenching, excessive yawning and tiredness, almost no sex drive, and a jittery buzzy feeling.  I also enjoy a glass of wine or beer, but not with Lex.  More than 2 glasses and I get a head splitting migraine.  I don't know what's worse - feeling depressed and anxious or physically feeling like crap.  I was hoping the 10mg dose would help.  I stopped taking it and feel fine physically, but now I'm irritable and have the anxiety again.  Or maybe it's just I have too much stress right now?  I'm thinking of seeing how it goes for the next couple weeks after stressful stuff is over.  If I still feel anxiety, I may try 1/2 the 10mg pill to see if I can even out the feelings and not have the terrible side affects.

A year before starting, I had twins.  I suffered from severe postpartum depression.  I tried to get better on my own, thinking it was just ""baby blues"", but a year later, the depression was still there.  I was also beginning to have anxiety attacks.  My ob-gyn decided that I need to try 10 mg, and it has made me feel so much better.  The first few weeks, I felt very dizzy and tired.  I also had some headaches.  These side effects subsided after a few weeks.  Now, 3 years later, I am still on 10mg and doing great.  I have never tried to come off of it because I am scared I might start with the depression again.  I would recommend this medication to anyone suffering from postpardum depression!!  It sure has made a difference in  my life!!"

One of the symptoms that I saw no one else listed was difficulty breathing. When I had been sitting for a long period of time and got up to walk around, my heart would beat a lot faster and I couldn't breathe very well. After a couple of hours, I became very tense to the point where my lower back began aching. Near the end of the day, I was so awake I couldn't sleep ALL night, even after I took a sleeping pill. Lexapro may work wonders for some people, but I just felt like I took a stimulant rather than an SSRI.

YOU CANNOT TAKE THIS AT NIGHT if you have anxiety.  Yes, it will keep you up as I was up for 56 hours and no I am not bipolar because I was exhausted.  Dr. told me to take first thing in the morning and since then I have been fine.  In fact, a bonus for me is I have no appetite.  I'm only 50 lbs overweight and I am trying to lose weight but am an emotional eater.  So this has helped.  I just started it 3 weeks ago at 10mg, so we shall see over the next year how I do.

3597$Depression$3/12/2008 4:00:18 PM$Reviewer: TextLife, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$5$"I gained 30 pounds taking this medication, despite careful diet and exercise.  (My primary care doc says he 'doesn't understand why I'm not losing weight.') On the other hand, I don't cry at all, ever.  (I've been to two funerals for close family members and, while I certainly wanted to cry, I couldn't.) In that regard, I think that the drug has evened out the real ""lows"" of depression I used to experience, but I also think it has rather flattened my affect.  Parents and friends remark that before I started taking it, I seemed much livelier. I also have practically no sex drive since starting it.  (And I used to be a gal that really liked sex.) 

In short:
Pros: Flat affect (no mood swings) 
Cons: Weight gain, 'zombie' feeling, low libido"

I tried the Lexapro and took it in the morning when I woke up. After about 2 hours I was sooooo tired, and could hardly function at work that day. So then I tried it at night and then suprizingly it made me wired. My doc told me to try a half of a 10 mg tab in the AM to taper onto this med. It worked better but then when I was to try the full 10 mg again it made me extreamly tired again, not to mention the weight gain and wanting to eat everything in sight. I started Zoloft tonight. I hope it works better with less side effects. I hate trying diffrent things to see what works and what doesn't.

I was so anxious, I couldn't function. It took 4-6 days to get into my system. Some of the side effects I've had are hot flashes (similar to taking Niacin) and low libodo. I am emotionally flat most of the time, and I do get frustrated/angry easier. My patience is much lower than before, but considering the alternative, this is all acceptable. I have gone off this med 2-3 times. By myself, and with medical advice. It was very difficult each time. I had relapses every time. So I plan on taking it for the long run. I hope it will work for you as well.

My Nurse Practitioner started me when I was actively suicidal/very depressed and warned me about the slight chance of increased suicidal thoughts. I feel much better and do not have any suicidal thoughts. I'm getting back to myself again and have started actually enjoying life. I have a decreased appetite, which I welcome, and the very tired feelling i had the first couple weeks has passed. "

I was on 0.5mg The Doc put me on 10mg that worked for a couple of months. I had go on 20mg I did get lazy slept most of the day then up every other hour of the night back to the doc he uped it to 20mg plus a half I didn't even want to get out of my pj's  I thought if they don't make 30mg maybe you shouldn't be taking them. Three months before next appt. so I weaned myself off I had some problems but when I did I thought about the money I was saving. When I go back to the Doc I will get something else or nothing.

3621$Depression$3/4/2008 3:40:06 PM$Reviewer: Anonymous1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$1$This drug does have side effects that can be quite difficult for some.  I had frequent headaches and dizziness.  The side effects way out did any minor benefits of the drug. Coming off of the drug was even more problematic.  It was horrid.  I was disconnected and dizzy constantly.  I almost passed out on numerous occasions.  I felt sick constantly.  I couldn't focus on anything.  It was horrible.  Even more troubling was having two doctors tell me that they had never heard of such a thing from Lexapro while my pharmacist told me the opposite.  All the research I had done listed all of the symptoms I was having and then some in coming off of the medication. I know two additionall people taking the medication that have had nothing but problems while on it and coming off of it.  I have since switched to a much more effective remedy with no side effects-5-HTP.  I have never felt better and have had absolutely no problems with taking 5-HTP.

Suicide was not one of the reasons for it. However,  I noticed a considerable increase in ideation. I have not gained any weight.  I sweat like I am in the Bahamas everyday weather it is freezing cold outside or not.  I seem to be more depressed, lazy and have more anxiety than ever before.  I now have changed my doc and will change meds too.  The sexual side effects really bother me, mostly because I can not achieve a full peak.  Sex is not normally a big issue for me but when I want to feel that release and can't that really effects my husband's manhood.  One last thing about this, I truly believe that I have been going through the change of life because of this medication and at 31 I should be at the best part of my life. This medication did not effectively take away my symptoms I believe it made it worse.  Thanks

After that dosage didn't help much, my dosage was increased to 20 mgs.  I did notice it worked at first, but then I started getting worse.  The depression became more severe, so severe I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed or want to be around anyone and my anxiety turned into frequent panic attacks.

This has all happened in the span of a year and I go back to the doctor this week to change medications.  There wasn't many horrible side effects, but I did notice that after never suffering from acne in my 30 years of life, my face was constantly horribly broken out.  I also put on some weight that I couldn't lose, I found that I was angry & mean at some moments for no reason, and my sex drive decreased.

Overall, I don't recommend this medication because it didn't work for me, but others may have luck with it."

Spent 8 days in the hospital a few weeks ago due to sudden onset of severe depression.  While hospitalized, I had to work up to 50 mg of Lexapro to stabilize (highest dosage I've seen posted).  I've been in group therapy about 3 weeks now.  After about a week on the medication, I started having some nervous shaking, teeth chattering, and one MAJOR panic attack.  Doctor put me on some Klonopin and that took care of the anxiety effects.  Overall I am doing much better considering I was in the hospital 3 weeks ago and am now at home (though going to group therapy daily on short term disability).  One bad side effect of Lexapro for me (being a male) is sexual dysfunction.  But, from what I read online, that is a ""common and known"" issue.  To describe the problem in ""kind words""... let's just say the bomber can take off and fly the mission, but can't deliver the payload.  I know that may still be too graphic for some, but I tried to be polite about it.  I hope the doctor slowly tapers my dosage back and that issue gradually goes away.  But, for now, I will take it as an acceptable trade-off compared to being hospitalized with depression and feeling there was nothing to live for (though I have a great life going!).  Good luck to all you fellow Lexapro-ers out there.  Hang in there everyone.  Depression is what is bad, WE ARE ALL GOOD PEOPLE.  We will get better in time.  Take care!"

I took Lexapro for symptoms that were related to anger, lack of interest, depression related. I have taken a variety of different depression meds over the last 10 years but had stopped about 2 years ago as I felt that i had plateaued. I was given this med by my OBGYN. Started on 10mg, after about 3 weeks increased to 20. At first I felt an immediate response at 10mg, however I still felt very sad, so I asked for an increase in dosage. Again, almost instantly the med incease kicked in and although the depression was pretty much gone, so was everything else. such as, any energy, I was sleeping much to much, I was happy not to be so angry or sad, but well aware that I felt lethargic and very bla. At 8 weeks I saw my obgyn and explained my concerns and symptoms, it was agreed that having no energy, flat-line personality, and a weight gain of almost 10-15lbs was not worth this particular med. The weight gain flipped me out as I was already over my limit, having no energy kept me from wanting to get off the couch, having a ""who cares"" attitude didn't help either. My very big concern is on the flip side of all of the negatives is that I was very calm and mellow, making me a very easy person to be around, my family reacted to this part of the treatment with me so well. I am disapointed that I am not able to continue this med for that reason. My Dr. suggested that I take the med when I feel an episode of overwhelming sadness or anger related to my periods - mostly what took me to this in the first place...  I felt that there was no happy medium with Lexapro. I am off it completely now, I am clear headed, have not felt as depressed and have started to walk every day and work back into a healthy full excercise and diet regimine again, I am also being very mindful of my inner thoughts and moods more so that I can not be as reactive towards my family.

Initially I was prescribed 10mg, then 20mg, and finally, 30mg.  I was on 30mg for almost a year, but I noticed no change in my anxiety/depression.  Despite the very high dose, it just didn't seem to work.  Perhaps that was because I didn't have much anxiety in the first place, or perhaps I wasn't that depressed, but nevertheless, it just did not work for me.  Getting off of it was easy; I would advise (to be on the safe side) decreasing the dosage by 5mg at a time (for maybe a week or two), then repeat until you hit 0.  Although I am not a psychiatrist, I have heard (anecdotally) that Zoloft is a superior anti-depressant/anxiolytic.  Zoloft also works for OCD, I believe.  I would talk to your physician (and do some research) before starting on Lexapro...you may find that Zoloft is superior for your symptoms.

Well, I would not suggest anyone else try this, I did not do well without it. I am about to lose my job due to a buyout and this was the time I decided to try this experiment. I not only freaked out, I also had designs on taking my own life. I started taking the drug again and behold, I no longer have that problem and seem to be dealing better with the job situation as well. Seems to work very well for me...

3763$Depression$1/21/2008 4:27:24 PM$Reviewer: Lori, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $2$1$3$I have been on 10mg for just under a year.  I should of done some investigating.  I told my doctor I wasn't sleeping well and was somewhat unhappy with what happened to me time after having 2 kids close together.  It is called life....I should of listened to my instinct and waited to get more me time than letting my dr. put me on meds.  I specifically said I didn't want to gain weight and I enjoyed my sex life and didn't want any interference.  Unfortunately, I let him talk me into it and continued with it til now.  I have since gained at least 20 lbs. and have a harder time orgasming. The weight gain has not helped my self confidence either.  I started weening myself off the meds slowly and will try to deal with the side effects - dizziness, nausea, memory issues both on and getting off meds.  I have since been able to join a gym which my kids also enjoy going to.  That is how I used to be - very active.  I just had to be patient until my kids were a little older to allow more time for me.  Again, I should of listened to my instinct, not cover up everyday issues of a new mom with medication.  Some people need extra help with all kinds of issues.  I just think my doctor was quick with prescribing without understanding my background.  Too quick to line the pockets of drug companies.  There are way too many people on meds that might really not need it.  I am not discounting some real mental issues that need meds.  I used to work with a psychiatrist and do believe many do need meds.  I just would recommend investigating the meds and getting a couple of opinions if possible.  I just cannot wait to get off this med.  Good luck to those of you on it.

I felt like I could go up to any one and talk to them...and when I was around obviously mentally ill people...(homeless schizophernic people)  I felt like my mind would go where thier mind was...to a scary place, and felt unsafe...so I would avoid places like Venice Beach, where there are a lot of ""strange"" characters.  I finally had to get off it....and the withdrawal symptoms are horrible....I have lost several jobs from being overally emotional and not able to get up and function.

Lexapro hasn't made my problems go away; it has returned me to a state of mind where I can deal with them.  Very slight stomach upset the first night.  Some people have more severe reactions.

Upon realizing that I was taking Serzone, the new doctor said, ""We have to get you off the serzone."" He started weaning me off gradually. Then prescribed Lexapro. After taking it for about 4 years, I still thank God daily for the Lexapro. Before Lexapro, I laid in bed with no will to live or sat in my recliner doing nothing. I had no interest in anything. About 3 or 4 months after starting Lexapro, my usually unobservant son-in-law remarked that I seemed to be a different person from when he was worried about me at Thanksgiving.

This sympton was NOT discussed by my doctor nor my pharmacy, do now I feel better knowing that being having been depressed further by losing your sex drive to this junk stops by changing pills.

I was crying all the time, had no energy for everyday things, getting angry at the stupidest things and all I wanted to do was sleep. I am on my second week of this drug. I started feeling more like myself within 5 days. The crying went away and so did the anger and my energy started coming back. The only side effect I noticed was a ""medicine head"" feeling throughout the day and some diarrhea that has since gone away. I have not noticed a change in my libido. I am thankful to be on this medication and getting back to myself again!"

3869$Depression$12/21/2007 1:55:33 AM$Reviewer: sakura_aoki, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$2$3$Well it does it's job very very well but I had a very strange side effect that only my mother and I (as she was also on it) had. I slept about 20 hours straight about once a week or I slept 14 hours every night. This also occured when my dose was moved up from 20 mL to 40mL.I was, before it, a self harmer. Probably once every other day, about a month after I was able to stop completely though this doesn't always happen. It sometimes made my head spin a little and I was often dizzy, though that is possibly just me. The other thing is I had severe withdrawal reactions. To be honest i felt like i had an axe in my head. My best advice with that is don't drive, don't take any of your thoughts seriously, and likely if you call a pharmacy they will give you two if you can't get through the weekend (i discovered this and it was a lifesaver). Most people apparently do not have this problem. It also works very very well along with concerta. It is a very good drug for what it does just doesn't match up with my body chemistry.  I suggest it and if you can't afford it's price Celexa works as well it just is missing an anti-anxiety affect. 
3870$Depression$12/20/2007 2:24:34 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I've only been taking this medication for a little more than a month but I have noticed a difference in my mental clarity, my mood, and just overall feeling of well being. I was hesitant to take a medication thinking that I shouldn't be depressed because things in life weren't so bad. However, I feel much more like myself than I have in some time. I'm resting better at night and feel more awake and engaged during the day. My only complaint with the Lexapro was the regular bouts of diarrhea I experienced. Were it not for this side effect, I would consider it a complete blessing.

The depression is better, but the side effects have been worse.  I've developed sleep myoclonis (involuntary muscle twitches all over the body both day and night), for which I'm now having to take Requip to counteract.  I've also remained very fatigued -- at least as badly as before treatment, if not more so -- and have not have the energy to resume the exercise I used to enjoy before the depression hit.

The sweating wasn't as bad as w/ effexor. Once I changed jobs it took me about 3 mths to wean myself completely off of it. I had slight balance and nausea issues and feeling as though I was dropping in a elevator at random events. My responsiblities have changed again and the stress has returned along w/ the old symptoms of being angry and edgy all the time. It is symtomatic of the position as my coworkers are all under the same stress and half of them are flipping out! The rest are burnt out... I can't flee or fight the changes as I need to keep my position and as the company is paying for it I will finish my education. I will be speaking w/ my Doctor next week to get put on a 10 mg dose as the stress level will be managable w/ this increment. If I take the 20s I will be a flatliner again and I need to retain my personality...

By the 3rd day, the side effects were gone and I was feeling great.  My depression has lifted, I haven't had any outbursts of anger and my moods are not constantly shifting anymore.  I also suffer from OCD and it has also helped in that respect as well, though that is not the reason for my starting on the medicine.  The only negative has been that I suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and it has brought back (at least I assume it is the medicine) some of the abdominal pain.

3923$Depression$12/7/2007 10:59:47 PM$Reviewer: Akiko, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I couldn't achieve an orgasm with this medication.  I was ALWAYS tired, sometimes on the weekend, it would take me forever just to get out of bed. I was always yawning, I would take little nap breaks at work and I would never do that! Even though I had 8-10 hours of sleep, I always felt that wasn't good enough.    I was also bitchy...  It did nothing for my depression. For my social anxiety disorder, that helped, in that sense I felt more confident in talking to people but if you got on my bad side, then oh well... you know the rest, lol  I was also hostile to my therapist and accused her of not supporting me!  I told my doc who was doing med management for me what was happening to me and he says, okay we'll put you on Wellbutrin.  Mind you, before I was taking Lexapro, I was taking Paxil CR (now that was a totally different story).  With Wellbutrin, I can get up from my bed, clean the house and actually function as a normal human.  I find myself looking at life a little different. I'm currently on the 150 mg and later will be on the 350 (I think but too lazy to look at the bottle in the bathroom, lol)..  I will write later and let you know how the higher dosage works compared to the 150 - but see the Wellbutrin reviews.  It does make me thirsty, so thats a good thing, I also have my libido back as well as my earth shattering orgasm, yippee!  Depression is gone, I am always smiling and my eyes look alert.  Bottom line, Lexapro did jack for me. If you like sleeping, looking tired, sweat alot, bitchy and hostile, the inability not to have an orgasm, have a low libido, I say go for Lexapro.  If not, have your doc put you on Wellbutrin.

I have really adjusted to the medication well.  I don't feel too many side effects but I am still tired all the time.  Sometimes I have bouts of double/blurred vision but that is ok with me as long as I'm not depressed I am feeling better than before.  I think this medication was a perfect match for me so far. I did notice bloating but have not gained any weight yet.  I weigh myself daily to monitor any sudden gain. I will update again.

Still have low days, but not as low as before. Still have slight anxiety when in large crowds, but pulling myself to the side and calming down helps. No thoughts of suicide. Good days greatly out weight bad days.

When I first began taking it, I had major depression with suicidal thoughts.  I've been on Lexapro for about five years now, and it has really helped.

Lexapro 15 mg per day. (Previously on Celexa.) Lexapro has lost a lot of efficacy with time. Weight gain, despite claims this is not an issue. Effectiveness as an anti-anxiety agent variable (I also take Xanax). Muscle pain has become a problem. Diminished libido from the start. Some blunting of affect. A big advantage for me, though, is that I am sensitive to meds, and Lexapro is one of the best-tolerated of the SSRIs. I'm hopeful that supplementation with another med, and/or tweaking the dose, will restore the beneficial effects for me.

In the past I tried Paxil and Prozac and did terrible on both. Lexapro basically saved my life. I do remember when I started the medicine I would have extremely vivid dreams at night that didn't make sense and it took a few months for that to subside. One downside of the medicine is that I gained a TREMENDOUS amount of weight; I'm only 5'1"", used to always weigh around 115/118 lbs, and I ballooned up 144 lbs. The drug manufacturer doesn't state weight gain as a side effect, but everyone I know who has been on the medicine has stated the same thing. I religiously watched my diet and couldn't lose the weight; this is actually the reason I went off the medicine. I am in a much better place, both emotionally and mentally, than I was before starting Lexapro, but I found the weight gain to be something that made me more depressed and miserable. "

I took Lexapro for a couple of years to deal with depression from a stressful job/condescending boss.  It did work, but when I stopped taking it I started getting brain jolts, zaps in my mouth, dizziness, vertigo type feeling when I would move my eyeballs, spinning when I would move my eyeballs, and I also had headaches.  It is very hard to explain the symptoms, but you know it when you are dealing with it.  I was absolutely miserable.  I didn't know what it was from and ended up at many doctor's offices thinking I had a brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, you name it.  They gave me an MRI of my brain, lots of tests, you name it.  Finally I did some of my own research on the internet and found that there a LOTS of other people that were going through the same thing.  I just had to type in the right thing in google and there it was.  There were so many people with the same problem, not only from Lexapro but other anti-depressants as well.  You would think doctors would know!These horrible things finally went away after about 6 months of torture.  I don't wish what I went through upon anybody.  I guess if you are never planning on getting off the meds then you are ok, but if it's just a temporary thing then I would recondisder.  The withdrawl symptoms are just too much.  I was also suicidal during the withdrawl.  It is out of my system now and I am clean of anything and feel much better.  If only one person reads this and listens to me it will be worth it to save them from something like this.

I have been off them now for many years until just recently when a family crisis brought me to go back on them.I've been on Lexapro for 5 weeks now and when I first started, I was really tired, could barely work, alot of yawning, jaw clinching, NEVER a problem with sex for me. Haven't seen the weight gain yet. I did notice though at about 5 weeks, on the way to work I felt very bad as if something horrible was going to happen to me. I don't know if I was trying to fight off a panic attack but I finally felt better late afternoon but it was the worst feeling in the world. Like my life was ending right before my eyes and there was nothing I could do to stop it. My girlfriend told me to call my doctor and tell him about it. Never did because the feeling subsided. The problem with me is that I get to feeling better and I get tired of the possible weight gain and ween myself off them. I'm staying on this one for now, seems to be working but is there an antidepressent out there that won't put the weight on?

Lexapro is the first antidepressant (others:elavil, norpramin, prozac, wellbutrin) which has effectively suppressed my anxiety.  I have not felt much, what I might call, joy.  But I have not been deeply depressed for over 3 1/2 months.  I've never gone more than 4 months without sinking into a dark tunnel.  The next month will be crititical, and I hope that I can follow up on these remarks.

However, right about the six week mark, I woke one morning to swelling in my hands and feet three times the normal size.  I could not fit into my shoes.  Also, my limbs ached terribly like I have never experienced before.  My feet hurt to walk on our hardwood floor, I could not hold a cup of coffee because my fingers ached so badly and I was bedridden for about 3 days because it was too painful to move.  Bloodwork from my doctor revealed a very rare side effect from this drug.  I was terribly disappointed since I really felt this was working for me.  My doctor has given me samples of Effexor to try instead so hopefully this will work.

It caused me to have a flat affect as noticed by a friend who didn't know I was taking anything.  Also, I had an incredible weight gain of 30 pounds in about 6 months. I experienced a lack of sex drive and also the inability to have an orgasm.  My husband was away for eight months and I wasn't interested in having sex at all.  Everything returned to normal after I stopped taking it. Lastly, coming off of this drug was shear hell.  I was so sick even though I was reducing extremely slowly.  I experienced what felt like electric shocks in my brain quite frequently.  All I wanted to do was sleep because when I slept, I didn't feel anything.  It was horrible.  I vowed never to take anything again, but recently I was convinced by another doctor to try Wellbutrin.  So far so good.

Doctors will tell you that you can come off of this med whenever you want, but they don't tell you about the hell of withdrawal effects that you'll have to suffer through in order to do so. I have been off of it for a month now and I'm going through exhausting ""electrical shock-like"" episodes almost nonstop. It's like being crually tortured! Along with the shocks, I have headaches, anxiety, and ""brain farts"". If you just want to go on something short term to get through whatever you're going through, I don't recommend this drug. It works very well and I had very few side effects, but plan on staying on it unless you want to see how tuff you really are! If you are a woman and think you might want to get pregnant within the next couple of years, think twice about going on this med or any other like it...doctors recommend coming off of them before conceiving. Look at all of your options, weigh out the good and the bad of each option before making a decision. Just do your research before going on any medication because the doctors won't tell you about how hard it is to come off of them. Good luck!"

I had been on many other anti-depressants and this is the one that has helped my depression the most.  I am on 30 mg as of just a few days ago.  I was on 20 mg.  I have had no side effects with the medication.  And they are easy to take and do what they are supposed to do.  I was put on them originally by a Psychiatrist and also recommended by my own personl Physician (Internist) who I have 100% trust and faith in.  I can't say the same for the Psyhiatrist as he only saw me for 5 minute intervals and I was out the door.  My own personal Internist can do the same prescribing and spends a lot more time with me.  I will soon be seeing a new Psychiatrist as my Doctor feels I may need a mood stabilizer.  So I don't know with that being thrown into the mix (depending on what the Psychiatrist puts me on) how it will mix with the Lexapro.  My Doctor feels I may be Bi-polar and need a certain medication like Lithium.  But that is up to the Psychiatrist.  When I was on Cymbalta 30 mg I was fine but when the original Psychiatrist prescribed the 60 mg I broke out in hives and a rash all over my body.  My lower lip swelled up and my face some.  I was in agony with that rash off and on for months.  So anyone on Cymbalta beware as this is what happened to me.  I never had one bad side effect from Lexapro.  I know a lot of others on it and they haven't either.  Lexapro is my anti-depressant choice.  And believe me I have been on at least 10 different ones.  Thank you.  Diane L.

I find that 20mg is the dose-not the 10mg; @ least for me. The cognitive therapy (CBT) helps-teaches me what to listen to inside my head, and what is part of the depressive thinking and to disregard. Just popping these pills is the start. CBT, exercise, sun light and no depressants (i.e. alcohol, marijuana, opiates and benzodiazepines) all are part of regaining control of your thinking.

I would have never believed it would give me the confidence to climb out of the black hole I often found myself.  The side effects are real - but they did subside for me.

Had to stop for that reason and switch to Zoloft for the gestational period. Zoloft didn't control my depression/anxiety. Following breastfeeding, psych tried me on Cymbalta which worked the first month but then made me feel suicidal (of which I have NEVER been suicidal in my life). Then, because of no insurance, psych tried Celexa trying to get a ""lexapro"" dose out of it. 

I finally gave up and demanded Lexapro back again. PostPregnancy, Lexapro is still NOT giving me the same relief of depression and anxiety as it did prior to my last pregnancy. I don't know why. I sure wish I could gain my happiness back again as before.

I was on a very high dose of citalopram (north of 40mg) and used that drug for two years.
Anyone considering using any SSRI needs to assess the clinical need of their use and weigh this against the potential side effects because there are many. These drugs take forever to start working. Don't under any circumstances exceed the dose you're prescribed without your MD's guidance...You will go to a very dark place. These drugs need to build up in your system. 
Once the citalopram took effect I felt the greatest I ever had in life...this in spite of the yawning and slight lethargy I experienced. Both drugs improved my concentration and I wake up feeling very alert. One other issue I had was that I relapsed when I tried to get off the citalopram and had to go back on it like less than a month after I discontinued. 
With the citalopram I had a reduced sex drive - not so much with the escitalopram. One other thing I noticed was that the escitalopram reduces my desire to drink alcohol...It may be useful for people with addiction.
My only complaint is that I wish this stuff would just work faster...if you're really suffering those initial three weeks before the drug starts to work can be rough. Furthermore I need higher doses of this stuff and regular MDs (not psychiatrists) can only prescribe this medication up to 40mg. Basically it's a commitment if you want to use these things and they're bit of a hassle to get on and off."

I'd say for people with really, really bad major depressive disorder (i.e. thoughts of suicide) this would certainly be better than nothing.

I had always relied on my anxiety to keep me in check, but the Lexapro had numbed that out too. I never left bed, failed classes during college, and let apathy take over. I didn't care about anything: eating, my grades, my friends, my family, showering, or taking care of myself. I got out of bed maybe once or twice a day to take care of my cat and that was it. I got off of it about two months ago and I feel like me again, but still riddled with anxiety and depression. Lexapro, you were my miracle drug for a few months, but I couldn't be apathetic forever.

I'm talking euphoric/orgasmic almost.  Greatest f'ing yawns in the history of yawns, y'all can't even imagine.  They wore off after like 4 months though.  The medicine didn't really work for me, other than by giving me side-effects.  My head was always cloudy, I was unable to focus on my thoughts, and my jaw always was tense.  I had twitching and headaches, nervousness, restlessness, and all of those other ness's as well.  Thanks for prescribing this to me, my dear waste of a psychologist!  Don't even get me started on the uselessness of this type of profession.  The only revelation that was concluded from our sessions was that it was a waste of my time and money.  I could've gotten more insight from talking to my cat.  

Because of the horrible experience with Lexapro, I opted out of taking anymore Anti-D's for 3 miserable years due to fear of having to go through all of the side-effects again and coming to find out that it didn't work.  Three years is a long time to continuously contemplate the many different ways you could just end it all.  Anyways, I am now on Effexor, and I can no longer feel the emotion of sadness whatsoever.

I am very angry at the psychiatric community and I think these drugs are dangerous and should not be used. I feel that these drugs cause harm to the mind and spirit.

I had medication resistant major depressive disorder. Had taken 30+ different psych meds, was barely functioning. The FIRST time I took Lexapro, the constant unbearable sadness that plagued me as a young child and all through my teens just disappeared. Gone. It never came back. It was like I was reborn or something. I never knew what it was to feel ""normal"" before taking lexapro. To NOT have that horrible, aching, sadness overwhelming me every minute was an indescribable feeling. I've been on it for almost 11 years. I does cause me to sweat horribly, all over my body, even sitting in the office at my desk. BUT I would rather be sweaty and happy then paralyzed by debilitating and relentless depression."

I don't find it having any sexual side effects as well as adverse reactions with other drugs. I do take other medications as well as I have had any side effects with them. Before I tried Lexapro I had tried many other SSRIs and I couldn't tolerate the side effects. However Lexapro has worked like miracle for me. Also I did switch from brand name to generic, when it became available and haven't noticed much difference.

I have tried to go off of this medication, only to find out that i still need it and withdraw is a bitch. Your depression and anxiety will only get worse. Brain Zaps are real. If you are considering stopping lexapro, do it gradually and under strict supervision. With Lexapro, it's difficult to understand how angry and depressed I used to be. I am a different person in a much better place. I have experianced sexual side effects, but never severe or very often.

After being on Zoloft for several years, when my depression and Anxiety spectrum returned we decided to try Lexapro. It just never felt 'right' from day 1. After several months, I noticed the feelings did not improve and I figured I would need to live with it. I tried varying doses, from 5 MG up to 20MG. Nothing worked. Now almost a year since starting, I've made the switch back to a low dose of Zoloft. Within weeks, I again feel 'normal' and I am not plauged by the overall unease I felt on Lexapro. 

More specifically, the negative: increased anxiety, developing agoraphobia, EXTREME laziness and no motivation, obssessive thoughts and headaches, jaw clenching/bruxism caused a bit of damaged to my TMJ, memory became an issue, cost (even the generic.) Withdrawal, even on a taper back over to Zoloft, is difficult. A lot of agitation, anger and headpains/aches that are beyond description.

The positive: hardly any sexual side effects. Upon first taking it one year ago, for a few weeks there was a bit of unexpected euphoria. For me, that was short lived and slowly the negative impacts crept in. 

Being mindfull now, everyone IS different. We all are wired uniquely and our chemistry varies--other conditions may add or detract from how a drug works for you. I know many people who love Lexapro and it has worked well for them (interestingly, the ones I know have all been female! Just coincidence, but interesting). It wasn't for me, though. Which is why I always suggest to keep trying until you find something that works."

It definitely took away the strong feelings of depression and suicide... but also took away feelings of happiness and enjoying everyday activities. Eventually I had to increase dosage to 20mg to stay effective. If I would miss a day, the effects were immediate - irritable, angry, short temper, etc. Always felt tired while on this drug... was changed eventually to Viibryd. No other side effects noted with Lexapro really.

It doesn't make me tired at all. I built up a resistance in about 2 months that caused the doctor to increase the dose from 10 to 20 mg daily. 

The first time I took Lexapro I was also depressed. I stopped taking it after 1 month and it was a small dose. It made me less depressed so I would consider it to have worked. 

I have never continued to take it once I started feeling ""normal"" again. 

This time I continued taking it way beyond the point of my ""Normal"". It had a Manic effect on me as best as I can tell. I have never felt like that before. 
I was feeling great! 
I was getting a solid 4 hours of sleep a night and was able to get up in the morning a few hours ahead of schedule. I even felt good about my work and home environment. 
BUT
I starting singing aloud for no reason. I couldn't stop talking to myself. I decided to make up some imaginary friends to entertain myself. I was unable to control my thougths without shutting down or giving it my full concentration. I got angry over nothing. I started thinking about killing myself. I became paranoid and stressed out over my living situation. I came very close to doing something that I really couldn't control. Very scary way to be, not in control of your brain when you really need to be. I took risks that I wouldn't normally take. I went to the doctor and we both agreed to stop taking it right away. 

Before this antidepressiant, I was taking prozac for depression. This works much better for me than Prozac and I didn't see any side effects other than going Manic. I think I should have stopped taking it once I hit my ""Normal"" like I did before."

I'm diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder/depressive type and psychotic depression. I was going to have ECT but decided to give the meds one more chance. Lexapro seems to work the best. However, being male, I'm have severe erectile dysfunction and no libido. The doctor said this was most likely caused by the med. So it simply was a decision I had to make. I'm single and I'm more concerned with my illness and its treatment than being sexually active. My depression if not treated often caused severe delusions that would place me in a dangerous situation. However, after all this time including a commitment to a state hospital for over two years, I was always taught by my treatment providers that depression doesn't have to be treated by a only a drug. Finding a type of therapy such as CBT, DBT, or finding a support group is very beneficial. After years of seeing only my failures and problems my therapist made look back and remember good things and write them down. Self affirmations are nice also, and a little ice cream is good too.
717$Major Depressive Disorder$5/15/2012 7:14:05 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I went on Lexapro for depression and severe anxiety.  Effexor did not help the anxiety symptoms which I have had all my life.  It is a miracle for me to feel normal in the mornings, not anxious for the first three hours after waking, and my depression is great as well.  I literally wanted to kill myself as well as all the other symptoms of depression.

I would suggest giving this the full 6 weeks before deciding.  My symptoms got worse for the first 2-3 weeks and I had to increase the dose from 10mg to 15 to 20 and 20 is working so be willing to increase if necessary, as well as waiting the 6 weeks before making a judgment call.  And don't throw in the towel if symptoms appear worse before better because your brain has a lot of adjusting to do.

I cannot say enough about this.  It has literally saved my life and given me my life and myself back.  I love it so much.  I feel normal, not happier or high or anything, just normal and balanced.  Still feel happy and sad when I should which I'm glad about.  Having the serotonin and norepinephrine (sp?) balanced makes such a difference in my life and I hope it will in yours too.  Don't give up!!  And if this doesn't work for you there are plenty of others that may be the one you need, but this has more than worked for me!"

752$Major Depressive Disorder$4/4/2012 4:45:44 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year$3$2$3$"I've had two major depressive episodes and decided to take Lexapro for the last one.  I have also tried Zoloft and Prozac in the past and generally do not take medication between episodes.
Lexapro worked quickly and well--I felt improvements within a week and completely recovered after about two months.  It's clearly effective.
I do have some complaints, however:

1.  First and foremost, Lexapro has a nasty withdrawal.  I have never had a problem coming off SSRIs in the past but had significant trouble with this one.  Tons of ""brain zaps,"" irritability, mood swings, etc.  
It's a real pain to taper off.  Make sure to do it very carefully, slowly, and under supervision.  If you taper off too quickly, you could end up depressed all over again.

2.  Sexual side effects were the worst of any SSRI I've taken.  In my case, much lower libido and difficulty reaching orgasm.  Most SSRIs have these extremely unfortunate side effects, but this one gave me the most trouble.

3.  Dosing is a bit awkward.  10mg didn't work quite well enough for me and 20mg worked but made me feel like a spaced-out zombie.  I was too frustrated by the end to try 15, admittedly, but there isn't much room for finding an ideal dosage.

4.  Extremely expensive if insurance doesn't cover it.  It's set to go generic this year, although I don't have the latest news on this.


Every medication works different for everybody, and this was only my experience.
I would first and foremost say that if you feel depressed or anxious, make sure you see a therapist and make appropriate lifestyle changes.  
If you need an antidepressant, I would recommend Prozac--very cheap, works for me at the minimal dose (20mg) and no withdrawal.
Maybe this will work for you, but I won't be taking it again."

My doctor increased the dosage; it's been a week now, and the side effects are descreasing. I feel better about life; I'm laughing again and friends are noticing the difference in me. My advice for those experiencing side effects is to give the drug a chance. I hate what I call the ""psychotropic nightmare"" of changing anti-depressants, but it's unavoidable when you have acute, incurable depression. When it's time to change meds you just have to bear with it and give the med a chance to take effect completely, make any changes as needed, and stick with it. Good luck to you all. Depression is an ugly and frustrating disease to work with, but persevere and you will win. A good psychologist is a good idea as well. When you find a good one - talk! Get it out, get over it and go on with living your life as you never have before!"

I felt like I had complete control of my emotions, and a far more extensive range than other antidepressants had allowed me, e.g. Zoloft and Paxil. However, I am five foot three and always weighed under one hundred and five pounds, and have been very active and proud of my toned stature. In the first year I started lexapro, went from less than one hundred and ten pounds to just under one hundred and sixty. Not only was the sudden, SIXTY POUND, weight gain  enormous (despite my seven day a week intensive martial arts exercise and healthy eating) a shock), but it  happened over six months, which caused serious pressure on my muscles, skin, and general energy level. I was an extremely fit, athletic person who suddenly lost all physical confidence despite feeling emotionally great. I switched to Wellbutrin XL three months ago and have already lost over thirty pounds without any exercise, so I am in no doubt that this horrible medicine ruined my confidence, relationship, and sex life. Lexapro made exercise and diet useless, and the mere switch, even eating whatever I wanted and exercising a minimal level, led to an extreme change.

Coming from the DoD (civilian) career field, I find that psychological warfare is very effective.

When i was hospitalizedi was on zoloft (horribe drug) then they put me on lexapro 10 mg 1 time a day. I find that i need to take my medicine the exact same time everyday for it to be effective. I experienced nausea for the first week but it went away. Eating the medicine with food helped as well. I was taking 4 other medications and the hospital took me off of them and started lexapro a day after my admission. After being on lexapro for a month i feel that tired, i wanna sleep all day type of thing, i get upset very easily, but i have had a very tramatic 2010 so hopefully i can pull it together here and keep on truckin! I plan on asking my dr. if i should go up maybe to 15 or 20 mgs so i can get some energy. i sleep all day and stay up all night because of anxiety,and when i sleep during the day its always in and out, never a deep comfortable sleep. The medicine has kept my weight at a stand still which is beneficial because when i was on all of the other meds i was gaining between 5-7 lbs a month. Overall i plan to give the drug more time to work, and hopefully when i get some energy to get a job again and live that normal life that everyone with depression would give up their arm for. The winter blues don't help the depression situation either. Hope this was helpful to all of you.
1140$Major Depressive Disorder$2/5/2011 11:46:08 PM$Reviewer: sap2491, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$4$Lexapro has given me my life back. Around this time a year ago, I was in an ambulance on my way to the hospital for an overdose and alcohol poisoning. I had to leave college, and entered a period of several weeks during which I could not even bring myself to leave my bed. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, put on suicide watch, and prescribed Lexapro. Today, I am happy to report that I have found myself again. I work at a job several days a week, I go out with friends, and I am applying to transfer to a new college. I haven't felt the hopelessness that I used to feel in many months, and I consider myself a content person. This was by no means an easy or short road. Lexapro is not a magic pill that will have you waking up the next day smiling like Vanna White. It took several difficult months of adjustment, and it's not a pill that works for everyone. I still have sadness and depression occasionally, like any person will. It doesn't interfere with my ability to live a happy, successful life anymore, though. I know that I will also face difficult when weening off the medication, but I am prepared for that. The most important thing that I have learned from this is that there is never a reason to give up. Depression doesn't define you, and it isn't forever. Your life isn't blanketed in nighttime like you might think, it is actually just a cloud obscuring your sunlight, and it's ok if you need a little help moving out from behind that cloud.

For about 4 months I felt great, looking back I think I was experiencing some kind of mild mania, and then I had a backfire problem. I became suicidal and stayed that way for about six months. It was about two months after I stopped using the drug that the suicidal thoughts began to lift.

However, my depression eventually relapsed, and despite continually upping the dose until it was past the range of tested clinical efficacy (40 mg), I was still depressed nearly every day for two months, characterized by low energy and motivation, as well as occasional, fleeting suicidal ideations. I was prescribed bupropion to take in conjunction with the lexapro, giving me substantial increases in energy and motivation which I felt that lexapro had sapped from me. However, bupropion did nothing to fix lexapro's sexual side effects, which had once been mild but were now approaching borderline-impotence. I decided that I'd enough of this; thus, I tapered off the lexapro over the course of a month, during which I experienced persistent ""brain zaps"", increased agitation, lowered energy, lowered concentration, suicidal ideations, and derealization.  However, once the influence of this horrible substance had completely left my system, I began feeling back on track with the bupropion. I still suffer from depression but I'm much more functional, focused, and motivated than before.  In conclusion, Lexapro did nothing but potentiate my depression.  I will never put another SSRI in my system again."

You are crippled in random extreme crying, headaches/migraines and more. I started taking Lexapro in January 2010 at 5mg. after 4 months I had to move up to 10mg because 5mg wasn't enough. 5 months later I started taking 20mg and I've been on 20mg ever since and it's working very well. Next week I am moving up a dose to help me deal with my recent surgery pain and anxiety. The withdrawal symptoms are horrible. You get weird brain buzzes, and my hands and feet go numb, and I get dizzy. But that's if I miss 3 doses or more in a row. Overall Lexapro works very well if you remember to take it correctly and if you are honest with your doctor on how effective your dosage is. I hope I helped!

The Lexapro is a great help. I did sleep for nearly 3 weeks while adjusting, putting up with quick dizzy feelings shooting through my head but that did subside.
I have moved on with my life and I am naturally happy and no longer wish for death so I went off the drug. I am having a serious withdrawl problem when I was told there were no side effects or dependency problems So I started the ""weaning"" steps. I fall over, I have shooting dizziness again and it makes me feel very ill. I hope that ""it"" will stop within 3 weeks. I also had to stop this medication as my ex took my insurance away from me and I am 100% uninsurable due to 2 declineable diseases and I cannot afford this drug. If there were a generic, I would stay on it only because of being so sick trying not to take it anymore.

It continues working just fine w/out pooping out nor needing a dosage increase. I started at 20mg because when Forrest introduced Celexa they said 20mg was the average dose-it was later proven that 40mg was the average effective dose. Over the years Lexapro has also shown that 20mg is the average effective dose. Sex drive can be an issue if your relationship is based on same. On the other hand, the love drive on this med increases significantly. If you were severely depressed and unable to eat/losing weight-you will regain your appetite-weight. If you were moderately depressed and over eating you may slow down and lose weight or not sometimes. Aerobic exercise will help w/the depression and the weight-but you have to ""Just do it!""

I generally feel more positive. However, while I was having sex last night it was dramatically different. I have been very sexually active & usually enjoy it very much, but last night I felt nothing other than the tactile sensations. I felt like there was no way I would even come close to orgasming. & my boyfriend was doing the same things he has always been doing which previously had been very successful. Also, I have noticed that I've gained a couple pounds. I do kind of feel like a zombie but I'm not complaining because I function even better & it's a lot better than chronic panic & despair.

The entire next day I was sick to my stomach and unable to keep any food down, extreamly dizzy, and I had a horrible headache and could not take pain reliever due to drug interaction warning. I thought my body would get used to it by the next day, so again at 6pm I took the 10mg dose and tried to quickly go to bed. I had difficulty getting to sleep, staying asleep, and night sweats both nights. Woke up for work at 3am vomiting again, the same headache and inability to keep food down, but now I had developed shivers (teeth chattering) and excessive sweating. I feel like I have had the worst flu of my life for three days and am terrified to take another dose.

Lexipro is the first medicine of this kind that I have taken and NOT had side effects with.  The only problem I have with this medicine is the cost.  Since I am uninsured now and there isn't a generic version available, it is very difficult to afford my medication.

I have a family history of mental illness, so my doctor believed wholeheartedly that my serotonin levels were imbalanced in my brain.  I was skeptical initially in taking Lexapro, but I began taking the 10 mg tablet daily by taking half a pill at first then the complete pill.  After a month of taking Lexapro 10 mg tablets, I FEEL ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!!  I have always been a woman of faith, but joy is restored and I have a clear outlook.  My psychiatrist has practiced medicine 35 years, and she knows her field extremely well.  With God, therapy, a loving support system, and my medicine, I will be okay.

The benefits outweigh any side effects (which were almost none at all) and I am so happy that I have stuck with it! Has seriously changed my life. I'm no longer a prisoner of my own home and a lot of my anxiousness about situations has subsided. My relationship with family/friends/boyfriend has improved ten-fold as I am not constantly in a state of fear and can be more relaxed and happy around them. I recommend this drug to anyone suffering from depression, ocd, panic disorder, or any anxiety related disorders! Lexapro is truly a lifesaver.

I went from 10mg to 15mg with 150mg of Wellbutrin - Lex makes me sleepy (I could sleep for 17 hrs at a time AND go back to bed an hr later & sleep for another 17hrs no problem!) so my Doc put me on the Wellbutrin which has counteracted the sleepiness. My sex drive is almost entirely gone, I have severe hoarseness but that is it - I haven't gained any weight - I also can't have even a sip of alcohol - beer, wine, vodka - nothing at all w/o throwing up. After not knowing what was wrong for almost half my life the almost total loss of my sex drive is a very small price to pay for happiness. I would recommend.

I was scared to start any anti-depressant b/c my sister had a bad reaction to one.  This one has been great, but now the positive changes are fizzling out.  My doctor and I may need to play with the dose.  When I take too much, I feel a little manic. But now I'm holding at 10 mg, and while I can get through the day without crying, I'm still sad and lack energy.  Overall I DO recommend this drug.  I've had very few bad side effects.
1900$Major Depressive Disorder$11/9/2009 5:05:55 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$4$"When I started taking Lexipro, it was like night and day.  I was diagnosed with MDD when I was 10, and have struggled to find treatment that would work ever since.  The first day I took Lexipro, I felt like getting out and socalizing, something that has never happened to me before.  People around me noticed a difference (my grandpa commented that I had more sparkle).  The downside is if I don't take my pill at the same time every day, I get diarrhea.  I also have trouble sleeping, and as a result am tired all the time. Lexipro also does not manage my anxiety as well as my previous medication, and I have had a sharp increase in panic attacks. 

Overall, though, Lexipro does such a good job managing my mood, I'm willing to over-look the side effects (which do seem to be getting better as time goes on.)"
1904$Major Depressive Disorder$11/9/2009 8:06:12 AM$Reviewer: LIFETIMESUFFERER, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Let me first say that for the first 2 weeks, I wanted OFF this, but after a lifetime of no med ever working 4 my depression, I'm SO glad I didn't! I haven't been able to work out of the home for the last 3 years because of my depression/add/pmdd (hopefully that will change) so was able to take the time to adjust. The 1st couple of days I thought I was losing my mind. I'd be crying for ten minutes, then extremely agitated for ten, then ok for ten - press repeat.  Essentially, 1st two weeks didn't feel at all like myself & had severe nausea, sleep problems, you name it including suicidal thoughts (try not to be alone, although I had to). But after having tried no kidding EVERY other drug out there just about with no luck, I was desperate & hung in there, just hoping. 2-3 months into taking 10mg I WAS noticing some improvement but not enough with my anxiety, so my doctor upped me to 20mg. So I had a repeat of the two weeks of hell - after a couple of weeks it was bearable but still wasn't myself for a couple more. Now, while I do still have to fight the depression, at least I feel I can. I can actually usually choose my reactions to stress instead of my reactions choosing me, have spent more time out of bed and actually able to function when my PMDD isn't kicking my butt ten days a month around my period (any suggestions for this?), & have been able to cope MUCH better. BTW, just some of the other drugs I tried (and yes, did give them at least a month or two - didn't have the severe side effects as with the Lexapro, just zombied out): Paxil (never again!), Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor ... there were more I can't remember off-hand, including ones for anxiety/panic attacks.  It had gotten to where I didn't believe in the meds at all before trying the Lex.  Now I wish I'd hung in there before & kept trying until I found one that worked for me. Could have maybe saved me years of grief and a messed-up life. Anyway, REALLY grateful for this drug! Hang in there all & keep trying!

1985$Major Depressive Disorder$10/11/2009 12:12:01 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I took tricyclics, then Prozac, then Wellbutrin, before starting Lexapro. None of the previous worked as immediately or as well for me as Lexapro. (My advice: DO NOT JUDGE THIS OR ANY MEDICINE BY SIDE EFFECTS IN FIRST FEW DAYS. If I had stopped any of these medicines based on first couple of days, I would never have taken any anti-depressants and life would not be good. Or really, I might not be here anymore.) BACK TO SUBJECT: On Lexapro, my anxiety was improved, as well as my depression. I used 10 mg for about a year, then upped to 20 mg when it seemed necessary. I will say that I have been more sleepy, less energetic and have an increased appetite (translation: I gained 30 lbs. and I am a skinny person). I also have had increased problems with memory and concentration, and have trouble finding words when I am speaking. I am not sure whether the focus/memory is due to the Lexapro or not. But it doesn't help those areas, so I added Wellbutrin to the Lexapro for a time in order to see if focus/appetite/energy could be improved. I may still do that again at some point. My dr. said that using an SSRI for a long time can lead to less dopamine, which you need for concentration, energy and other things. For now, I am switching to a drug that acts on more than one neurotransmitter (norepinephrine and serotinin) just like the combo of Wellbutrin and Lexapro to see if that helps with fatigue, focus and memory. But I would not change a thing about my experience with Lexapro. It was the right drug for me at the time. If you are anxious and depressed, it is an especially good option. Realize that you may have to revisit whether it's the best option from time to time.

It started with St. John's Wart from just about birth, Prozac at 11, and then I went through Valium, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and probably a few others that I don't remember. With the exception of the Prozac, everything seemed to work for a time but then I would need to up the dosage or combine it with another drug. It always felt so ridiculous to watch the commercials for whatever I was taking and hear them say that, because I was under 18, I shouldn't be taking it. Lexapro has been great so far, though as I said everything worked in the beginning. I haven't had any noticeable side effects and though getting my insurance to pay for it has been hell I hope to continue seeing the same improvement in my mood.

Lexapro has been the last drug of choice for the past 5 years or so. I have tried just about every antidepressant out there and they usually do what my doctor calls the ""poop out syndrume"" on me. Lexapro was fairly easy to trasition over to from my last drug, Prozac. However, I have never taken a medication that has taken me back to the way that I once felt years ago. Lexapro just helps me get by and there are times when it lags, such as when a sickness is coming on. In general, the side effects to this drug have been the same as any other antidepressant...fatigue, sleepiness, worsening of mood, when starting the medication. They went away for me in approximately a month. The one thing that I do like about this medicine is that it is easy to mix with other medications that may be prescribed by my other Doctors.

I would suggest this product to anyone who has tried in vain with other nuances.  Usually 10mg is more than enough, you need to give it time. I was told 10mg of Lexapro is equal to 40mg of Celexa. Lexapro is a much better, cleaner solution with far less long-term side effects than other antipsychotics and SSRIs.

I was on this medicine for the severe depression for months taking the highest dose prescribed, and the only thing I got out of it was a whole lot of sleep. When I mean a whole lot of sleep I mean I did not have the will or the drive to get out of bed. Good thing I was always asleep because my suicidal thoughts and feelings of unworthiness were worse off on the medicine then off. I never experienced any weight gain because I never got out of bed to eat.

2285$Major Depressive Disorder$7/1/2009 5:59:08 PM$Reviewer: bestsis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$I was on a 5 mg starter dose for 4 days. during day one I felt great. Depression lifted. Day 2 I noticed a funny tingling in my cheek. day 3 I noticed the tingling in my leg and arm. By day 4 I had severe pain in my hand. I stopped taking Lexapro, and each day i felt the tingling, pain and numbness decrease. Also by day 4 I noticed excessive sweating, nausia and diarea. These also resolved after I stopped taking the med.
2293$Major Depressive Disorder$6/29/2009 10:29:10 PM$Reviewer: better, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I went into a serious depression last September and had thoughts of suicide.  My doctor put me on Lexapro, and it was like a miracle drug for about 6 months. I gained some weight, lost my libido, and was unable to attain orgasm.  Decided I'd had enough & wanted to know if I could live without.  No one  told me about SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome (aka withdrawal symptoms).  I got brain zaps in my head which were annoying; they have mostly gone away after a month, and I feel myself again.

I started out with 10mg,three months later uped to 20mg, now I'm on 30mg. daily. I thought I was doing better, but then A started gaining weight, almost three dress size. That just made me more depressed, besause I have been trying so hard to lose weight. Then I ran out for over a month. I tought I was lossing myself all over again.I didn't even want to get out of bed. I am a single mother with three kids so you can just imagine how hard it was for me, just to sturggle to get moving. Then on top of everything I showed symptoms of Insomnia. I now take 100mg Trazidone nightly just to go to sleep. There has to be something better out there.
2313$Major Depressive Disorder$6/22/2009 10:47:15 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$For the past two years, I've gone from being slightly depressed to being majorly depressed. I couldn't sleep but when I did, I never could make myself get up and around the next day. I would cry at the drop of a hat and my moods were insane. My doctor tried me on Celexa, which was the worst drug ever for me. I never had a problem with anxiety until I started that drug && once I did, it just added to my problem. She then decided to start me on Lexapro 10mg and I've been on it for a little over a month and I think it is amazing. I can deal with things so much easier than I used to, my whole outlook on everything is just so much better.

2374$Major Depressive Disorder$6/4/2009 2:56:48 PM$Reviewer: griff1jm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I am 31 yrs old female. I am on 5mg of Abilify and 10mg of Lexapro. Sometimes less is more. This combo for major depression has worked. I have been on Lexapro for 4 weeks and on Abilify for 6 months. For the 1st week I felt worse but stuck with it. The only adverse side effect now from Lexapro is the anorgasmia. My doctor has prescribed 150 MG of Wellbutrin XL (Eon Labs-Buproprion XL 150mg) to counter the anorgasmia but I have only been on it for 1 day so we will see if it helps. I am praying it helps without adverse side effects.

Been taking Lexapro for at least 6-7 years.  I have gained 50 lbs. but I am sane.  I cannot exist without medication.  I see in these blogs that people give up too easily.  What's more important to you?  A few side effects, weight gain, loss of sex drive OR death by suicide?  Life in a mental facility.  Some of you might not need these medications at all.  Some seem to be using it because you're unhappy.  Do any of you realize what it means to be truly mentally ill.  Lexapro is my lifesaver.  I take 40mg daily plus 150mg Wellbutrin, plusTrazodone at bedtime.  Please give the meds a chance to work no matter what you're on.  Sometimes it takes 3-4 weeks to have an affect.
2376$Major Depressive Disorder$6/4/2009 2:13:48 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was put on this medication for severe depression and because I was entertaining thoughts of suicide. After only an hour of being on this medication it had made my anxiety so severe that I was literally trying to scratch my spine out of my neck. It seems like I am one of the very few people who have an adverse reaction to this drug but I never have and doubt I ever will feel as bad as I did when I took it.

When I comb my hair in the morning, I get a full handful of hair on my comb!!!!  I have to keep my hair in a ponytail because of it, so I don't get in my food or other things, etc.
