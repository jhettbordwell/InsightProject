1$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/2/2019 9:03:25 PM$Reviewer: MyLife, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$On and off, Mostly on for 3 or so years. 1stly, effects were noticed by others before noticed by myself. Weight loss due to loss of appetite and then mild weight gain once I started feeling a little more care free. This 'drug' definitely helped with my anxiety. It made me overall very positive. Not 100% better but way more bearable. Helped with getting angry. All was great until I started to continuously notice this lack of empathy, cloudiness In what felt like my frontal lobe, my sex drive severely dropped, and then this major suicidal depression came like a freight train for some reason. Honestly It bummed me out but I knew getting off it was for the better. Now that I have been off of it for a few months, I like the natural feeling better. I think. My anxiety is back but I feel like I can deal with it better. My thoughts come easier. My memory is better.. It feels more 'real.'  However I still have a depressing cloud that lingers over me But SO much better then what was happening to me towards the end. I miss not getting angry so easy and the ease of having positive thoughts. However Im hoping that this experience has helped me learn how to balance things on my own without the help of a prescription. Overall it 'worked great,' My dosage might have needed to be changed. It could be the stressful but Im confident that being off medication is more the type of life I wanna live.

I was always so anxious and suffered from depression, but feel like I can handle life much better now.  I initially started with 10 mg and moved up to 20 mg which is perfect for me.

I was barely able to function. It worked at 10mg for a while, then once my baby was born, my dosage was increased to 20mg. I continued to take that dosage for about 2 years until I finally told my doctor that I don't notice a difference in my life and she then upped the dosage to 40mg. Now, I experience anxiety worse than before, along with insomnia and zero sexual interest. My husband and I have not been intimate in 6 months because of this. I see a new doctor next week and I honestly can't wait to try something different.

1608$Anxiousness associated with Depression$8/16/2017 6:28:31 PM$Reviewer: Steve peace, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$I was precribed celexa when I was in my teens. I took it for over 1 month and then stopped taking it for 2 months. Out of the blue for no reason at all I carried out an act of extreme violence and ended up in jail and then was found NCR. The police took my bottle of celexa away during the arrest. That was a very long time ago. Now im out I hired a lawyer and he got the legal system to purge my ncr records. My employment criminal background check has been clean every since. There is no record of it happening. It has been a very stressfull ordeal for me to deal with the system all these years.

I would get so nervous while driving I would shake and my heart felt like it was going to explode, I would get really dizzy. I mostly stayed home and it turned into depression. I had taken Celexa before as a teenager when dealing with anxiety, at that time it worked well for me but I got pregnant and stopped taking it since, that was 8 years ago. My doctor prescribed me to Celexa again and after about a month I started noticing that I was feeling so much better. I could drive without much anxiety at all. I wasn't shaking or feeling I was on the verge of an attack. I never realized how much anxiety was taking over my life. The only side effect is pretty bad dry mouth. I bought celexa here http://health-care24h.com/catalog/Depression/buy- Celexa.htm

1632$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/20/2016 6:21:34 AM$Reviewer: Anonymous, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I didn't realize how much it does for me until I stopped taking it for a couple weeks. Anxiety attacks are very rare and I almost never cry (this used to be a big problem). Doesn't improve my mood much, and sometimes I still can't get out of bed, but I don't get sick from the stress nearly as much. I haven't gained any weight, but my sex drive has been affected much more than I would prefer.

1636$Anxiousness associated with Depression$3/28/2016 1:26:04 PM$Reviewer: Logan, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was experiencing long term problems with anxiety and depression that I finally realized required medical help. After discussing the problems I was dealing with, my doctor prescribed 10mg of citalopram for me with instructions for a return consult in a couple weeks. I felt a little sedated at first but also much more at ease and less depressed. Wife quickly noticed the difference in my demeanor as well and now makes sure that I take the medication on schedule. I had some minor GI upset initially which dissipated. The only other problem with taking the drug was when my doctor increased the dose to 20mg, which caused some sexual difficulties. After contacting my doctor, I was instructed to reduce the dose back to 10mg a day or two before sex might be expected and then back to the 20mg dosage afterwards. I know, this disrupts spontaneity but the overall tradeoff is well worth it for both me and my wife. We're both very happy with the results of the drug.
1637$Anxiousness associated with Depression$3/22/2016 4:32:41 PM$Reviewer: Gemma523, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$Before starting this medication I was very nervous about the potential side effects I read about online and other users negative reviews. I have now been on celexa (citalopram 20 mg) for a little over a month and I haven't experienced any negative side effects other than drowsiness after taking the medication. I take it before going to sleep at night so that it does not affect my daily routine. It wasn't until about the 4th week that I began to notice that my anxiety had decreased significantly. I used to become completely overcome with anxiety and worrying almost daily and I have now gone an entire week without becoming anxious at all. I do still experience anxious thoughts on occasion but I am now able to redirect my thinking and let them go rather than obsessively focusing on them and becoming depressed. I have never reviewed anything like this before but as there are so many bad reviews out there I thought it was important to let people know that my experience has been nothing but positive.

I thought nothing was wrong with me just had to much on me,then someone said you need to find a doctor  to write you something for depression. I thought about that for awhile then decided to do so . the doctor wrote me celexa. i've been on  it for a week. I sleep fine but i'm still sleepy through he day at work and when i get home a crash. I have noticed that things that were bothering me do not as much now 
1640$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/27/2016 11:09:11 PM$Reviewer: hj503, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been taking Celexa for almost 6 months now and it has been a blessing for me. I take 40 mg every night right before bed and it has helped control my anxiety and depression. I have had anxiety and depression and have been medicated for as long as I can remember. Celexa has been the best medicine for me so far and I have been on plenty of other anxiety and depression medicines. I notice when something begins to upset me or stresses me out, I become slightly dizzy and it feels a little like I'm having an out of body experience to the slightest degree. The feeling and dizziness fade quickly once I'm able to calm down. It's nothing horrible and it doesn't bother me much because the good effects from this medicine outweigh this side effect. I don't have the ""numb"" feeling that everybody talks about. I still feel happy, sad, and angry like I should. I'm just able to get through my days without the crippling effects of anxiety and depression. It was a little hard for me the first few weeks because I was convinced it wasn't working and I felt like my anxiety was actually increasing. But I stuck with it faithfully and at about 6 weeks, I started to feel pretty good. I stopped having so many anxiety episodes during the day and I noticed I was a slightly bit more optimistic about life. I knew it was FINALLY starting to help and it has continually helped me more and more the longer I have stuck with it. I know Celexa isn't for everybody but it's been a literal life saver for me and I'm pleased with the mental progress I've been able to make since being on it. "
1642$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/12/2016 4:06:11 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Went to the doctor for worsening frequency of panic attacks; never wanted to take medication but got to the point where I was not able to do my job.  Started this and within 2 weeks completely stopped having the attacks.  Overall I feel happier than I ever have, and so much less anxious.  My sex drive isn't as high as it used to be, I have almost no appetite (I only eat because I know I'm supposed to, and hypoglycemia contributes to panic episodes), and I have occasional nausea that goes away quickly, but these side effects are 100% worth it.  I am happy (don't know when I've ever been able to say that) and most importantly, I am able to do my job again!

My husband and daughter call it "" my happy pill"".  It has worked very very well for me and I dare not run out of it. I do suffer from with anxiety and depression and have been on many different types of meds for it but Celexa works best for me than any other drug. I have not had any side effects from using Celexa"
1656$Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/23/2015 9:50:19 PM$Reviewer: Lexi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$"I took this medication for about 3 months to treat my anxiety and depression. The first two months I had a lot of nausea always about 1 hour after taking celexa, however, it worked amazing to relieve my anxiety and depression. For the first time in years, I was able to relax and was happy. After the second month though, I just began to feel numb. I didn't care about anything. Things that used to upset me no longer did, but things that used to make me smile didn't affect me either. But my depression prior was severe, so I stayed on it and focused on learning about myself and how unreasonable it is to feel unnecessary anxiety leading to depression. And things were better.

The reason I stopped taking celexa is because it caused SEVERE MEMORY LOSS. It started small. I couldn't remember what happened yesterday. Then, after month two, I couldn't remember conversations people would tell me I had with them. And at the end of month three, I was standing in front of a desk somewhere  (I don't even remember where I was) with a woman in front of me asking me what my name was. I stared blankly at her. I couldn't remember. I apologized and had to pull out my wallet and look at my drivers license to remember my middle name. I then began researching the drug and discovered that memory loss is a common side affect. I immediately stopped taking it, but it still took me about 3 months for my memory to return to normal. But on a positive note, it  feels back to normal now (about 1 year later) I apologized to my friends and let them know what I was going through, and surprisingly, one of my friends who I've known to have memory problems told me that he was taking the same medication. He ended up cutting his dose in half afterwards and noticed an improvement in memory. I still recommend it as a relief from the pit of anxiety and depression, so you can understand how life should feel, but I would never recommend it long term. Use the time on it to learn how to live."

After a few weeks, there was some improvement, but I felt the drug helped my anxiety more than the depression.  The dose was increased to 40mg.  Still felt ""lopsided"", in that the anxiety was under control but not the depression.  This drug clouded my judgement, as I said some things and felt like I put my foot in my mouth!  Very embarrassing! I mentioned these things to my doctor.  She said Citalopram is more for anxiety than it is for depression. My doctor switched me to another drug, which is helping alot."

I felt better in about a week, so much so that I thought it was just me, and the placebo effect. I went on to look at reviews, and realized it happened that way for a lot of people.

I take the 20mg. it took probably about two weeks before i noticed anything different. My family noticed an improvement in my mood the first week. I can wake up in the moring and not feel dread and i can control all my emotions so much better. I dont cry on a drop of a dime anymore. I actually laugh and it feels amazing. This medicine has changed my life. The only thing i get as a sideeffect is the constant yawning, but ive grown accustomed to it. Thank you citalopram.

Life was just too hard. This medication works very well, and I can usually tell if I miss a dose. Before I took this I wanted to have more intimate and sexual relations with husband. Downside is not caring if I have sex or not.
37$Depression$12/12/2016 12:06:49 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$"I started taking Citalpram 20mg in March 2016, and have recently had my dose increased to 30mg.

The first couple of weeks on the drug were difficult, but it was nothing I couldn't deal with. I yawned a lot, felt less inhibited, and a tiny bit dizzy.

After the side effects wore off, and making sure I took my medication everyday, I can now say I feel much better.

At first I was reluctant to take Citalopram, but I know I needed that extra bit of help. It's not a magic wand, or a wonder drug, but it has helped me to help myself."

If I take too large of a dose I end of tired and unfocused.  I end up cutting the pills to a 1mg dose and at that level I can tolerate the side effects and still benefit from the drug.  Unfortunately, even at this trivial dose I have a significant sexual side effect.  At times I've stopped the drug for months and the side effect still remains, I fear it may have become permanent.  Now I need to go back on the med, but I'm hesitant because I'm so worried about this side effect.

Had some really bad things happen in my life.  Went into a deep depression. Didn't seem like it was working anymore. Went to a psychiatrist who had me try over 12 different anti-depressants over 8 months. None of them worked for me. I ended up back on citalopram 60 mg which is working exceptionally well for me. It also helped me with all my anxiety. Can't say enough good things about this med.

I couldn't get out of bed and cried every day. I was talked into taking Celexa by my DR. After 3-4 weeks, I did stop crying and could get out of bed. But seeing a counselor helped me the most and have come to terms with my crisis event. After 2.5 months, I have stopped taking Celexa. I talked to my pharmacist and the side effects (for me) were multiple and harsh. Nausea, dizziness, diarrhea and the worst was the trembling in my hands. I thought I was getting Parkinsons! Good luck to all with finding your happiness.
75$Depression$5/19/2015 1:41:32 AM$Reviewer: Nv, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$This medication has changed my life. It has worked wonders for me. With any medication there are side effects. I am so anti medication and tried herbal or alternative medication. However with severe anxiety and depression this medication has helped me get back on track in life. I was very anxious about taking the medication but now I am taking it I wish I'd done it sooner. You do need to be patient to see results and also tolerate the side effects because in the long run the benefit of this medicine outweighs the minor side effects. It works for me but maybe not for everyone, however it's worth a try as doctors wouldn't prescribe something without benefiting you and making you better.

I have to agree with many on the fact that it is VERY hard to try to get off of this medication. Unfortunately, for me I am better staying on ot. I use it because I just feel out of control when I am not taking it and a cry easily when not on it. I just pray that anyone searching for help gets the help that they need. It has helped me but, with any medication there are most always side effects. Blessings to all!

Within about 2weeks I noticed that I was smiling more-even when I wasn't necessarily happy. Citalopram has most definitely increased my quality of life. I may not always be happy, but I enjoy life more. I get out more and actually participate in life. I was on 40mg for a few years and have now been on 20mg for ~a month bc I'm trying to titrate down as I may be trying to conceive in a few months. I have had some withdrawal symptoms such as ""brain zaps"" which sounds scarier than they really are. I notice my sadness and irritability more, but I'm pretty laser-focused on trying to get pregnant soon. So I'm toughing it out.

I highly recommend this anti-depressant for depression sufferers. 

I have never felt so normal in such a long time. But I developed a weird sleep problem. I'd sleep 14 hours a night. I couldn't get out of bed otherwise. I don't know if it's my condition or if it was Cipralex. 

I could only fully and actively function for a good 2-3 hours each day. Other times, I was sleepy and tired. Just constantly fatigued. 

I talked to my doctor about trying Prozac and he thought it was a good experiment. But I'm very hesitant after seeing the plentiful terrible reviews on WebMD of Prozac. 

Maybe I should stick with this sleeping problem than risk all of those seemingly commonly experienced side effects."

I didn't want to be stuck taking a medication the rest of my life so I stopped taking it to see if I could do without.  Bad idea.  Terrible side effects for 2-3 weeks.  I was dizzy the whole time and got headaches. Not to mention the bad episodes were back.  After the dreaded few weeks the side effects went away but I was still sad.

You are meant to increase it slowly to avoid the side affects. Only meant to take 20mg for all patients. some side effects on 5mg-sleepy, a bit of nausea, but feeling less stressed. I am concerned that my doctor didn't say to start slowly on them. I told my pharmacist that I'd had bad effects from amitriptyline years ago and that I wanted to start really slowly. She said 3 days with 5 mg.. then 3 days with 10mg, then 20 mg after that. I am not gonna risk that! Plus my driving has been a bit affected at 5mg. Start slow people. And if having bad side affects go back to your doctor to change the medication. Hope you all feel better soon, and be kind to yourselves and tell friends and loved ones how they can support you at this time.

238$Depression$5/5/2013 7:25:08 AM$Reviewer: Catharsis, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $1$1$5$They prescribed this drug because of the depression I experienced when my testosterone went low. I should have had the testosterone issue treated properly, but they insisted I used an ineffective testosterone gel. A year ago I found out that getting testosterone injections was far more effective and less expensive than androgen.  by then I was hooked on Celexa/Citalopram. I eventually weaned myself off of anti depressants, (thanks to medical mj which helped immensely, and I no longer need that) - but after 3 weeks off celexa, and my test levels normal, I had the biggest spiritual breakthru in my life. My gut feeling is BigPharma does not care about the condition of your soul, they just want to make money.  Anti depressants are only for people who absolutely need them or will die. I would do everything in my power to treat the real cause of depression, and not use an anti depressant. NEVER AGAIN for me. At age 58, my soul is finally free and I am back to normal and happy now

260$Depression$2/13/2013 9:24:58 AM$Reviewer: StillAlive, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"This wonderdrug is a lifesaver! I was unbelievably low, started taking it, and could not believe the positive results!

In retrospect, I discovered that I have been depressed most of my life. After hitting a major low, I asked my doctor for help, and he prescribed Celexa (Citalopram).

The only ""negative"" side effect is extremely low sex drive (on a scale of 1 to 10, about 0.5). However, considering how life is now worth living, I hardly even care! You probably can't understand unless you've experienced it...

For people just starting to take Celexa (or Citalopram), I suggest starting with no more than 10 mg in the morning. Don't take it at night! The side effects I experienced by starting off with 20 mg at night might not have been caused by the medication (according to my doctor), but I suggest that you take no chances: start in the morning with or after breakfast. Keep in mind that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it is NOT a train coming at you!"

In the first month the suicidal thoughts were the worse they've ever been, (I told my mom this and I was monitored so nothing rash was done) but I'm hitting my second month now and it's not so bad. It has helped ten-fold with the depression and anxiety, however it has made my skin picking dramatically worse. For me, that's not too bad to deal with because my skin picking was  never in dangerous places and it never really scarred bad. The side effects are also minimal.

After so long of suffering, I decided to go ahead and give the medicine a try.  Citalopram has definitely made a difference in my life. I felt like a whole new person. Starting off I had a tad bit of a headache, tight jaw, and dry mouth. It lasted about 3 days, that was it. I was moved up slowly therefore I did not experience any bad side effects as starting at a high dose will cause.  I would really recommend citalopram. Everyone around me says how much of a happier person I am, and I am not as afraid of being in crowds as I was before. Very life changing. It feels great not to feel angry, depressed, scared anymore like before.  I am now at 40mg and have been on it for 4 years.

Since I started it 3 years ago, I'm a different person.  I feel in control of my life and emotions.  The only problem I have with this medication is that it affects my sex drive.  I have much less of an interest in sex than I did before.  I haven't decided if it's worth trying a new medicine for that reason yet, since I'm so happy with it otherwise.

I felt I must be depressed because I have the usual financial, relationship type problems that face a lot of people at this time.

I fainted twice in a 8 hr period. After the second episode, I was taken to E.R. via ambulance. I was treated (?) and released.
My P.C.P., the following day, sent me to E.R. at one of our illustrious hospitals here at the Medical Center, Houston. This was the same hospital that put me on this ""Coctail"" to begin with while I was being treated there for 6 1/2 days.I was given Rx's upon release. 7 days later, while at home, I fainted twice in a 8 hour period. Upon release, the second time, I was told to stop taking the ""Tramadol"". In my own opinion, after extensive research on web sites as this one, WebMD, I stopped taking, not only Tramadol, but also Cymbalta and Citalpram - the drug, that in my opinion, caused these serious side effects and could have killed me !"

The side effects were tough the first 2 weeks but my Dr advised me to give the medication time to work. I was not able to get to sleep, felt tired and drained all day and had bad headaches,didn't want to get out of bed, I was clinching my teeth really bad. I did not feel any change in my depression. In fact I had people telling my I looked depressed.  I was also placed on Lorizapam for anxiety which works great. I continued to take the Citalopram at my doctors advise but I still experienced the same level of depression. After four months on the medication I still have trouble sleeping at night. If I miss a dose i have the worse headache. The biggest issue for me is that it is VERY hard to orgasm if at all. I advised my Dr that the medication was doing nothing for me plus it was interfering with my sex life so she switch me to Venlafaxine 150mg a day. I hope this works better for me.

On the plus side, the meds have definitely eased the urge to drink. The down side is I have headaches every single day. Hard to say whether they are due to alcohol withdrawal or citalopram, but taking Tylenol eases the pain. It has made me slightly constipated, I was hoping to lose weight since I cut out the alcohol, but I've stayed the same. The worst side effect is that I'm tired all the time! I feel like I'm walking around in a fog and am totally un-motivated to do anything above the bare minimum.

Since my mother was chronically depressed her whole life and so was her mother I decided to stay on the drug and lower the dose to 10mg/day.  Eureka!

I have been taking this for over 5 years and I am just starting to have sweating and insomnia issues that are not menopausal. I shower more and read alot to get sleepy.

I stopped taking it after 5 days.  I was prescribed this medication in order to combat grief symptoms and anxiety after the death of both of my parents.  I had high hopes, as I had never been on an anti-depressant and was hoping this might make me feel like ""me"" again so that I could do everyday activities without getting stressed and exhausted.  It did improve my quality of sleep and I woke up refreshed and energized, but I would ""crash"" later in the day, a few hours before I was to take my next dose.  It was how I imagine a drug user's ""highs"" and ""lows"" to be, on a milder level.  I had compulsive suicidal thoughts on this medication, and because of this I probably should have told someone I was taking it (I meant for my use of this drug to be private).  Nothing I would act on, but the compulsive thoughts were there.  After having one, I remember thinking to myself, ""woah, I can't believe I just thought that.""  I was almost more anxious on this med and the boomerang effect on my mood was just too much.  May work for some, but not for my particular case."

So if any men out there are having this problem.It's not you it's the medication.I had always climaxed everytime I had sex before I started taking this medication.With me I have to consider changing my medication.My girlfriend is getting pissed and doesn't understand the side effects.

At first, it worked ok and didn't have any side effects.  Yet, after a year of being on this medication, I have noticed that I don't enjoy anything in my life and all of my relationships are slowly deteriorating.  This medication has also made me extremely tired, lose focus at work, and gain over 40 lbs in the past year-this is very uncharcteristic since I only gained about 1 to 2 lbs a year before taking Citalopram.  After a major spell of depression while being on citalopram, I decided to ask my doctor to change my medication. I am now taking Wellbutrin for only 2 days so far and already feel better and more hopeful about life(dr. said Wellbutrin is an NDRI which affects the brain differently than SSRI meds like Citalopram).  I hope the Wellbutrin works.

I started with the usual 10 mg. Seemed to have good result in first couple of days. Then the usual increase to 20 mg (minimum therapeutic dose) after a week. 10 days after upping the dose I had been doing well but had 3 very 'down' days. Called the Dr., he upped the dose to 40 mg.
Had myriad of side effects at this point, including blurry vision, yawns, increased sexual desire, daytime sleepiness, night time insomnia, among others. Most were fairly mild (I can live on 4-5 hours of sleep if the trade off is feeling this OK) and passed after 2 to 4 weeks at 40 mg. Increased sexual desire is a good thing, I had NONE before. Girlfriend is much happier now.
I have had depression and anxiety my whole life. I had never sought treatment as I felt that I was 'dealing with it' effectively on my own. Boy was I ever wrong. I should have done this 40 years ago. Can't remember EVER feeling this good!
I just hope it lasts because it sounds like getting off of this drug can be very difficult."

I began taking 20mg once per day and it helped but not completely. My doctor upped my dose to 40 mg once per day and it has definitely taken care of my depression and stress issues. When I began taking it I got the shakes a little bit, but that ended after 3 days and I have had no problem since. It is definitely a miracle drug for my problems. 
On a second note, my daughter (26) began taking this for anxiety - 20 mg twice per day. It caused the shakes to start out with which went away, but then her hands, wrists, ankles and lips swelled up. It was the citalopram which caused these problems. So, two different results within our same family. She would probably tell you to stay away from it. I say it works perfectly, but please be careful. First sign of a side effect, call the doctor."

I started feeling much better within a couple of weeks, but it does make it hard to sleep. I was then given another medication for insomnia, but that just made me tired all the time, so now I just try to get along with a little tossing and turning before I can fall asleep most nights.
I've been wanting to get off of my meds for a while now, but it's been a struggle because I've become so dependent on them (as happens a lot with SSRIs like Citalopram, or at least so I've read). I halved my dosage to 10mg about 2 months ago and tried stopping them once, but I just started slipping back into a deep depression.
Citalopram definitely helped me get back the ability to get up in the morning and get things done, but it's a bitch to try to get completely off of it and to feel 100% normal again."

After 3 weeks on the medications I overdosed on both, trying to kill myself. I had to be taken off amitriptyline due to the effects that tricyclic antidepressants will have on my body after my overdose, i was put on 25-75mg trazodone as needed at night, and my citalopram dosage was increased to 60mg daily. So far I have been pretty content on this medication, however I am not sure if that is due to my life changes I have made since the episode. Trazodone is also wonderful for helping me get to sleep. If you are on this medication, DO NOT forget a dose. I forgot a dose one day, met with my therapist later that day and when I got home I was so distraught and upset and couldn't really understand why I was bawling. I also recently started hitting myself when I get upset and I had never done that before I took this medication.

I have been able to cope with the problems we are dealing with a little better. I take it at night and sleep very well, though have had some weird dreams and woke up yelling. When I took it in the mornings, I couldn't function, I was in a fog. I don't have as much jaw tightening taking it at night.  Still feel down though not as much, but am dealing with problems that are downers, can't change the problems. Everyone sees an improvement in my moods and are glad that I finally went to the doctor. Actually the doctor picked up on the depression and is helping me get along with life in an easier manner.

I started on 10mg about four years ago and within the first couple of weeks felt much better.  It worked great for about 8 months, but have had to regularly increase dosage over the last 4 years.  I didn't notice any side-effects until I was up to 40mg.  Then I started experiencing decreased libido and slight weight gain.  I've now been on 60mg (the maximum dosage) for four months and during this time have gained nearly 25 pounds, have no libido, and have horrible acne on my back.  And, the increased dosage hasn't helped my depression or anxiety.  I also was camping in the jungle in Central America and forgot to bring enough Celexa with me.  I was without it for about 4 days and the withdrawal was HORRIBLE.  I was dizzy and confused and my face went numb!  Overall, it worked wonders at first, but now am exploring other options and can't wait to get off of it!  I would not recommend taking more than 40mgs - it had no positive impact on me, and numerous studies I've read have indicated that this is usually the case.  If you're on 40mg and feel like you need to increase your dosage, talk to your doctor about switching meds!

I was depressed, angry and withdrawn from everyone around me and would bite someones head off without any provocation. I also worried about every little thing. After taking it for a month I started to feel better and mellowed. It's hard to get me angry now and the depression is gone and I don't worry about much of anything. Have gained 10 lbs recently but started working out and lost most of it and feel better too! Weight gain is only an issue if you let it be and choose to sit around and not work out and eat healthy. Can't reach a climax very easily, but solved my pme problem and that's a good side effect for me! There is no shame in taking it, I put it off for too long and regret it now. Life is so much better and everyone can stand to be around me again and I them. I've found I'm actually a fun person since taking this. Just take it! Wake up in the morning, take the pill and forget about it. Only warning I have is, take it everyday! If you don't you and everyone around you will know that your not on it! After a couple days without due to forgetting to take with me on vacation, I was back to my old self in full force. Don't let all the discouraging comments on this site sway you. Try it for a couple months and see what happens, if  you like it keep it, if not then try something else. But you have to give it time, it will not work over night! A month and a week was how long it took for me. Yeah I could feel something after two weeks but really noticed and started getting comments on my attitude after a month.

When I was upped to 1 and 1/2 pills I broke my tooth and have TMJ syndrome.  Dr. switched me to Lexapro........made me feel horrible mentally.  I'm back on Citalopram but 1 pill now and clenching isn't too bad and feel mentally great again.  I take it around 8pm, sleep like a log and am refreshed upon waking.   Have lost 4 pounds which I didn't need to lose.  I took Zoloft years ago and it made me a zombie and gained 15 pounds on it.  I highly recommend Citalopram but most drugs work differently on each person.  Report your symptoms to your Dr.  Dosage can make the difference.

710$Depression$8/4/2010 10:03:56 AM$Reviewer: d, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$I had been taking Paxil for 13 years and it just wasn't helping me anymore. I had anger issues,major depression, crying for no reason and horrible thoughts. I did not want to be around my loved ones, sometimes not even myself. Since taking this medicine I have not been as depressed, and the anger has subsided. I know it is going to take a little bit of time for it to completely start working but so far I am happy with the results will be happier once the tiredness goes away. If you are taking and anti-depressant or think you need one ask your Dr. about this medication.  
711$Depression$8/3/2010 3:30:43 PM$Reviewer: Happy Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug has made me feel a lot better.  Have problems with depression and also agitation/anger issues.  Since I have been taking this medication I don't fly off the handle like I use to and I don't just sit around in a blah state of mind. I take it at night because it does make me sleepy but I had rather deal with being sleepy than snapping at my loved ones in anger and being depressed.  Also before I started this medication I constantly woke up every 2 or 3 hours and I could never remember my dreams but now I sleep through the night and I can remember my dreams. My dreams are really random and vivid.  Overall I feel much better especially when I go to bed at a reasonable hour and get plenty of sleep.  I have tried several different medications but this one is the best so far.

Depression has gotten somewhat better, but the side effects are causing me great difficulty.  Always tired, weak and unable to sleep.  Doctotr says side effects should start to go away in a couple of weeks.  I hope so.  I want to get better, but I will have to stop taking this medicine if the side effects do not go away, for I am unable to function with no sleep.  Other side effects nausea, headaches, and food cravings.  Good outcomes, more emotionally even, not crying as much, not so much despair.

I was hesitant about getting on any mood med, but it has helped me tremendously. I am here writing this review... that's the point, I'm here. Diagnosed with major depression at 19, I was prescribed this pill by my family physician after several doctors visits relating to depression and its toll on my mind and body. It took me a while to loose some of the edge of being depressed all the time, but the fact is, I did loose the edge. Not perfection, but hey, no one is perfect. But I know that when I stopped taking this med, I relapsed into another major depressive episode. Went back to the med after 6 months of being utterly miserable all the time, and started improving within months. It takes months, realize, for this particular medicine to show its benefits to the user. Others see results sooner than you will; remember, when you're truly depressed everything is gray. If the roof fell on you you wouldn't care. That's depression. By the time you've realized that you need to see your doctor, make the appointment, actually GO and discuss what you're going through... you have already put your body and mind through so much stress OF COURSE the med won't be an instant cure-all. To the reviewers who've been on this pill for only five days or not long at all, WAIT before submitting your reviews. I am here to testify that without this medicine (the ONLY medicine or supplement I take), I wouldn't have been here today writing this really, really long post. 

Seek help. If this pill doesn't work after six months I would advise you to actively find alternatives with the help of your physician and your physician alone. Not a friend. Not a TV commercial or magazine ad. A real doctor. 

Believe me, you will go crazy (crazier?) trying to piece together all the med jargon you googled online. Hope this helps some one out there in internet land.

798$Depression$4/1/2010 1:19:38 AM$Reviewer: crowe27, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been taking this medicine since March 2008. It is the most effective one I have ever taken for overall depression, mood swings, bad anxiety, and bipolar disorder. It keeps me chilled out so I can relax and be myself, and not panicky and irrational like I can be when it gets bad. Different medicines work for different people, but after Zoloft, Paxil, and Effexor not doing it for me, this was a godsend. I am not advertising for this medicine, this is just what works for me. I recommend to anyone who has any or all of these symptoms to not lose hope and keep an open mind to medicine when therapy isn't enough. If the first or the next rx doesn't work, be patient and keep trying-everyone has a formula that will help make their lives liveable again.

Not only has depression (almost) disappeared, so has anxiety. (Which was still present w/Lexapro)

I read a previous comment about seeing things running across the floor but nothing there. I have a similiar problem (although very infrequenly) where I see something move from the corner of my eye. Nothing there either.
But hey .... If due to the medication, 
I sure can live with that."

The worst side effects I experienced were lots of yawning (I switched to taking it at night and it solved this) and loss of sex drive, which sucks but can be dealt with.

863$Depression$2/4/2010 10:11:25 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$"I really like this medication for a couple of reasons: it's milder than a 10 mg Lexapro, it's not expensive, it decreases any unnecessary feeling of guilt, and I haven't had an anxiety attack while on it. Overall, Citalopram is pretty good. I take 20 milligrams each morning but sometimes I feel like I need 30 milligrams in a situation where I feel the onset of an anxiety attack. I've tried to not take it for a day and I find myself feeling extremely nervous, anxious, having feelings of guilt for trivial reasons, and somewhat ""twitchy."" There is a possibility that these are a mixture of withdrawal symptoms and feelings of vulnerability to depression because I know I hadn't taken my medication.  
Another problem I have with Citalopram are the sexual side effects. I feel less sexually driven and an inability to climax on a consistent basis. My last discrepancy with this medication is a mild inattentiveness during conversation and daily tasks. Though these drawbacks are problematic, I will continue to take this medication because I feel like it has given me my life back.      "

A month later I went from a 137ibs to 152ibs so I contacted my doctor he said this medication does not make you gain weight, he said it was my diet. With total weight gain I went from 137ibs to 175ibs. After reading some of the comments at WebMD I found out that this medication DOES make you gain weight. I stopped taking the medicine cold turkey, I am back on my old medication and my weight is starting to come down. After leaving this medication, I had no more bad ideas but sometimes, I cannot control my eyes, they twitch from one side to the other for a second and it happens when im driving.

This med. stopped my out of control crying, the angry mood swing and thoughts of ending my life. After about 3-5 wks, myself, family and friends noticed a complete change! Happy again, brain was clear and no bad thoughts.

MY EXPERIENCE: My anti-depression prescription ran out and I lost my insurance. I call my previous dr and/or ;oca; free clinic // inform them of my situation (and I didnt take NO as an answer) and demand a RX from previous Dr and/or emergency appt at clinic (they charge per your income = I didn't have any money at the time and just had the bill for $20 mailed to me - paid them $2 a month until bill was paid) My doctor informed me that to stop most and/or any  anti-depression meds cold turkey can be and/or is life-threatening

I do have a few dizzy spells during the day also.  And I'm experiencing sexual side effects, but it seems to be the opposite of what everyone else is experiencing. I have an INCREASED sexual drive.  I am seriously waiting to be driving down the street and hit a bump in the road and go off.  And I feel this way all day long.  It's really kind of odd. I've also noticed a bit of dry mouth and I tend to daydream more often.  Overall I like how I'm feeling and I'm willing to put up with the few side effects I'm experiencing. =)

I don't think I would've survived had a compassionate Dr not suggested I start taking an A-D and doing some other things to manage the stress and depression.

I lost my health insurance not long after the marriage ended (unrelated, long story) and tapered myself off (the non-generic Celexa was very expensive.)

Big mistake. Half a decade later and after a number of setbacks and involuntary life changes and financial problems, I was a mess but because things had been happening slowly, I really didn't see it.

Recently and after a case of the shingles, several rounds of cold and flu, and an inner ear infection that took away my equilibrium...

Some family members sat me down and told me they were very concerned that stress and depression were ruining my health and for what might happen to me...

I went to my Dr and got a prescription for the new generic form.

What a difference! Less than a week back onto a 20mg dose and already things are changing for the better!

A-D's are serious drugs and can have serious side effects, if a prescription does not help or generates overtly negative effects, run back to your Dr and change something. I have a family member who had to go through 4 different drugs before the 5th one did the trick"

I posted about 2-3 weeks ago. 
The drug has helped me out a lot. I have been able to read and understand the self help and self improvement books. The side effects are minimal from what I experienced in the beginning. I am tired and I do have more head aches, but they are not bad ones. I have keept to 10mg and have not increased my dose to the full amount of 20. Though I do notice that I get a bit shakey and my eyesight seems a little fuzzy at times. I have started to feel down or cry, but now I am able to think why I am feeling the way I do. I am able to turn my mood around before it gets worse. When I do find my mood is getting worse, I can now reason with myself and look at the brighter side of every situation. It has helped me be more understanding, helped me stop yelling and helped me be more calm. I don't experience the Road Rage and am able to be more in control. Once I feel that my situation is changing or better than it was before. I will consult my doctor on how to get myself off of this, as I don't want it to become  a perminanat crutch for my mental health.
I do have a lower sex drive, but it hasn't gone away.    "

The only downer - when I DO drink, I get tired VERY quickly.  I can usually skip a dose if I want to party! "

The first doctor to prescribe it didn't listen when I told him it wasn't working. My new doctor prescribed me Lexapro which worked wonders but my insurance would not cover it so he gave me Citalopram. He had to increase it from 20 to 40 because it was not working. I have unfortunately gained 30-40 lbs which isn't helping with the whole depression thing. If I miss a dose, my mood swings are worse and I end up crying because I yelled at my little girl. :(

Extreme sadness and irritability. Constant anxiety over what the future holds. I have been taking a 20mg dose for approx 6 months. Beginning side effects where nausea, teeth grinding, vivid dreams (good & bad) and just a hollow feeling. Nothing mattered. These all subsided within 3 months. Lingering side effects are sleepiness, weight gain and sex drive. I have tried morning and night,I now take my dose at dinner time and that has helped with some of the sleepiness. My sex drive is low but the actual act has actually been enhanced. The anxiety, grief and irritability are at a much more manageable level. I don't know where I would be without this medication. With it I am a much easier person to live with.

1324$Depression$10/28/2008 5:46:33 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I did not realise how difficult I was to live with until I started with tis medication. I went to the Dr about what I thought where hormonal issues but after blood tests telling all was normal, I was asked if I was depressed.  After breaking down and crying over how awful my life was, I had to agree I could be.  The first few days I did experience a fogginess where it was hard to get words out when people where speaking to me, but now that I have been taking it for a month, I am not so agressive, do not feel so low, my confidence has come back and I can actually go to dinner parties and not feel so exhausted afterwards by having to speak to people.  I do not feel overly tired but I do take it right before I go to bed.

Hang with it for awhile. Everything gets a little better with every day you take it. MOST of the side effects diminished greatly for me after a couple weeks. Seemed like I had 'em all. Nausea, dizziness, forgetfulness, blurred vision, drowsiness, felt spacey, hard time concentrating. Most are pretty much gone, tiredness seems to be the worst but still better than when first started.
 Also for the guys, Dr. said it could cause impotence which it did but only for about a week and went away. Now, it's just a little harder to have an orgasm, but thats ok. Hope this helps you out."

Quickly went back to my anxiety, depressed moody old ways by the fourth day (had lots of energy though). Quickly went back on. I take 20mg. per day and have to say I like it but not the tiredness. My mood is superior to what it was so I won't be going off for now. I now sing to myself all day, I haven't done that for years. I feel good and happy.

Hope it gets better from all the good reviews I have read about this medication. I didn't take the xanax other then when I ONLY felt like I needed one. They were very addicting when I was taking them as prescribed. I was happy to hear that citalopram isn't addicting.  I use to get upset easily and cry when things really got to me, now I have been more relaxed and feel better overall. Im not on edge about things the last couple days and I hope I have the same luck as the other users at dropping a few pounds! Side effects with me has been a little dry mouth and maybe a little tired, but so far so good! Will report later with further comments.

My wife of 14 years divorced me for a 24 year old kid who worked for us, she was 38.  A friend recommended a psychologist but after the session she said ""you need to see a psychiatrist"".  She recommended one who said ""you're in pretty bad shape, let's see how you do with this drug"".  Well, after less than a week, I was alive again.  I slept well, no dreams, no anxiety attacks, overall happiness (before I felt like wanting to cry all the time) and best of all, sexually I performed like a million.  No ED or premature ejaculation.  I dated a lot of girls in their 20s (I'm 40) and many said they couldn't believe a guy my age could outperform kids their age.  When I told the Doctor I had ED he said the pill could help, but I didn't mention the PE.  It was after a couple of weeks that I noticed how long I was lasting that I looked it up and learned that Citalopram could help eliminate this condition and believe me it did.  This pill truly saved my life.

He said I was less moody and angry all the time. I'm not sure what kind of feeling or feelings I have. I do notice that I don't cry as much as I used to, but more often than not, I feel like there's no emotions.  Like this medication is holding me back from being who I am, good and bad.  After not taking this for almost 2 months, I started to feel very tense, jittery, and angry over the slightest thing. Annoyed at everything. I took two tablets, thinking that that would calm me down, and I had a very scary reaction of rapid heartbeat, excessive shaking and the feeling of loosing consciousness.  I also had fleeting thoughts of hurting myself.  My husband took me to the emergency room as a percaution. I don't want to depend on this medication, but I guess I'll have to.

No major depressive episodes or panic attacks (other than a few caused by other drugs) during this time. If I remember correctly, blurred vision the first week, but virtually no side effects since. Probably decreased libido but hasn't adversely affected that area of my life too much. It says not to drink alcohol, but I've never seen any real interaction while drinking. In all, a great choice, having had bad experiences with Zoloft (flat, 'zombie' mood) then Prozac (fine for a while but then truly horrible side effects when restarting it after a few months off). I question whether I still need it sometimes, but for now its still with me.

I suffered from depression, OCD, and anxiety since being a teenager.  After the birth of my daughter a year ago, I suffered from an extreme case of postpartum depression which pushed my current case of mild depression, OCD, and anxiety off the charts.  I finally sought treament last summer and started seeing major changes after 2-3 weeks taking 20mg.  My current dosage is now 60mg daily.  I suffered initally from all the major symtoms including headaches, drowiness, and loss of sex drive.  After 8+ months of using this drug, I only suffer from the loss of sex drive which seems to be getting better as time goes along.  Life is good now and I'm enjoying every moment with my family and friends.  My only regret was not to seek treatment earlier for my problems.

I noticed a difference after a couple of weeks, but after a couple of months I didn't feel I was as happy as I wanted to be. I tried adding Wellbutrin so that I could also quit smoking. The side affects were bad for me and I hadn't cut down on the smoking. I switched to 40mg of Citalopram two weeks ago and it's working amazingly for me. After being depressed for 10 years, I never thought I could actually be this happy. If this drug doesn't work for you, don't give up, there is something that will work for you. It might take a long time to find the right drug and dosage, but it's well worth it in the end. I'm glad I finally got help.

Although it hasn't taken the depression and anxiety totally away (it's not a happy pill) I feel motivated and can actually push the down feelings away and focus on something else. My depression isn't absorbing my life anymore, and I can function like I used to. I only wish that I would feel totally normal with no down thoughts, but I think therapy will help that go away. I have had no side effects except for yawning and tiredness a few hours after I take it, which helps me go to sleep, and this way I don't need a sleep drug for insomnia. I feel a little of the decreased sex drive, but that is a small price to pay for leading a normal life.

One thing that I have learnt is that you need to match the dosage with any weight gain - I had put on quite a bit of weight and a small rise in the dosage did wonders.

The 3rd day was fabulous - no headaches or nausea... I was in the best mood of my life. The 4th day was pretty good too, but every day after has been fairly blah. I suppose my disposition has improved a bit, but I'm still dealing with the non-hunger and I have lost 7 pounds because I can only manage to eat an orange or a yogurt every day. My hair has been falling out like it did after I gave birth. It definitely increased suicidal thoughts when dealing with a terrible break up two days before Xmas (though I had the presence of mind to have friends stay with me and not be alone), but it has helped me deal with everything better thus far. I'm going to take it for another month and see how things go. I'll let you know if anything changes.

(and I've taken most of them [SSRI's])  However, the sexual side effects have been difficult to deal with. Erection problems and anorgasmia seem to be more pronounced than with some of the other drugs.  My doctor and I have been trying to work around these problems with the ED drugs (expensive!) and several others to deal with the anorgasmia.  Typical.  Other drugs are needed to counter the side-effects of another!  Has anyone had success dealing with this.  If so, please post your experiences.

I have less bad thoughts and anxiety attacks, though this could also be from the ridiculous headache that I have had since I started taking it. I have been sick to my stomach and hardly able to eat also. I slept GREAT the first night, but only managed to get 1 hour of sleep last night - will try taking it in the morning to see if that helps. The other strange thing is that I am a very busy, rapid thinking person and if you picture all the trains of thought you have at once (which is typically 7) as lanes on a highway, I feel like 5 lanes have been blocked off and traffic is trickling through. Does anyone know how long the headache and nausea are supposed to last? I will post again as progress continues and side effects taper off.

1544$Depression$11/24/2007 3:32:45 AM$Reviewer: rihannanevada, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I got on this because I experienced too many side effects with another antidepressant.  On this one, I have relatively few.  I have gained about 5 pounds, but that is okay because I do not weigh very much.  It has helped with my depression, but I still feel anxious a lot, but that is probably mostly a logical reaction to life changes.  The problem is that I get very moody if I forget to take this medication, which I often do.  I then usually remember a few hours later and take it and start feeling fine soon after.  I have even experienced a panic attack because I forgot to take my dose of citalopram one day.  Also, I have been having worse nightmares than normal since getting on this, that bother me more than they used to.  Otherwise, this seems to be a good drug for me with few side effects, and hardly any physical side effects (no sexual problems unlike with Paxil :D )

Within the first 2 weeks I began to feel like myself again. I take it before bed every night and I sleep 100x better (I have been on and off prescription sleep meds for my insomnia for 2 years) the only side effect that really bugs me is increased sweating. It seems when I am dealing with a situation that used to send me into an anxiety attack I can handle it mentally but not physically. I have experienced a loss in appetite opposite to most of the reviews I read but with all the left over baby weight plus my late night stress/depression bingeing it doesn’t feel that bad. I also finally feel enough like my self to go back to swimming and the gym. So I am sure that I can get my appetite back under control.

It isn't that I am tired, but it is a common side effect that can be a little annoying at times.

I used to take ages getting to sleep and wake up in the very early hours.  I had tried several other SSRIs but none of them worked long-term.  Citalopram is different!  I can get on with my life and no side-effects! I am a pharmacist as well as a patient and am so glad to have been prescribed this medecation.

I switched to Citalopram from Lexapro, which worked great aside from side effects in the first 2 months. Lexapro was unfortunately not covered by insurance, which was why I switched. I was on Citalopram for nearly a year, but it was not as effective as Lexapro had been. My mood was much more variable - good on some days, but terrible on others. In addition, I gained 20 lbs on this medication because it increased my appetite and caused me to crave carbohydrates. I am currently seeing a Naturopathic Doctor and my treatment consists of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and fish oils. I feel better than I have in 10 years, without any chemical drugs and no side effects whatsoever.
1568$Depression$10/27/2007 8:55:46 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$5$This drug worked well for me for about 3 months and then I became resistant and needed a higher dose. After my dosage increase the side effects began to build up. The problem was, I didn't know that I was experiencing side effects from this drug - I thought I was just becoming very ill. After an MRI and spinal tap other tests to rule out multiple sclerosis (I seriously had 95% of the symptoms of MS) and a week in the hospital, I stopped taking this medication. The side effects completely stopped after about a month and a half and that was when I associated the 2. I wish doctors knew more about the drugs they are prescribing because I went to doctor after doctor with my symptoms and not ONE suggested that I stop or switch medications or even HINTED that the symptoms were associated with the drug.

Without the medication, I am angry and unable to interact with others without being abrupt and hurtful.

Time is the only thing that really can heal you but a little help isn't bad along the way. If you are thinking about taking the pill like I was. Do it. It will make you feel better. "
1633$Depression$4/19/2016 12:44:22 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year$5$4$5$I began treatment nine months ago because I was stressed out beyond belief. I work full time and take 6-9 credit hours/semester while raising two children. Surprisingly I was diagnosed with depression. I started with 10 mg of Celexa. My mood improved tremendously within the first two weeks. I had zero side effects. I don't feel numb to emotion, in fact I feel like I have better control over my emotions. Everyday stresses bothered me less. Overall I am very pleased with this drug. The only downside for me is that it does not interact well with alcohol. I like to drink socially and can usually hold my liquor very well but, since being on this drug, I blackout easily which never happened to me before. I have be very careful not to overdo it.

1647$Depression$1/8/2016 4:24:54 PM$Reviewer: lcrow, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I've been taking citalopram for a little over two months. Before then, I was sad all the time, crying for no reason, getting mad for irrational reasons, and just not caring about anything. I even quit a new job I'd just gotten because I didn't want to leave the house. At first, I got headaches and couldn't sleep while taking this drug. Now, I'm sleeping much better than I had been, feeling much more happy and energetic that I have in a long time. 
1655$Depression$9/23/2015 9:52:49 PM$Reviewer: Lexi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$"I took this medication for about 3 months to treat my anxiety and depression. The first two months I had a lot of nausea always about 1 hour after taking celexa, however, it worked amazing to relieve my anxiety and depression. For the first time in years, I was able to relax and was happy. After the second month though, I just began to feel numb. I didn't care about anything. Things that used to upset me no longer did, but things that used to make me smile didn't affect me either. But my depression prior was severe, so I stayed on it and focused on learning about myself and how unreasonable it is to feel unnecessary anxiety leading to depression. And things were better.

The reason I stopped taking celexa is because it caused SEVERE MEMORY LOSS. It started small. I couldn't remember what happened yesterday. Then, after month two, I couldn't remember conversations people would tell me I had with them. And at the end of month three, I was standing in front of a desk somewhere  (I don't even remember where I was) with a woman in front of me asking me what my name was. I stared blankly at her. I couldn't remember. I apologized and had to pull out my wallet and look at my drivers license to remember my middle name. I then began researching the drug and discovered that memory loss is a common side affect. I immediately stopped taking it, but it still took me about 3 months for my memory to return to normal. But on a positive note, it  feels back to normal now (about 1 year later) I apologized to my friends and let them know what I was going through, and surprisingly, one of my friends who I've known to have memory problems told me that he was taking the same medication. He ended up cutting his dose in half afterwards and noticed an improvement in memory. I still recommend it as a relief from the pit of anxiety and depression, so you can understand how life should feel, but I would never recommend it long term. Use the time on it to learn how to live."

felt so much better after being on this med for a while I decided to wean myself off it..bad move as I experienced such a bad relapse of severe depression, I thought I would never feel better again.  I went back on this med and finally 6 mos later I am feeling better again.  Be careful about going off your meds without doc supervision, it was a lot harder for me to feel better after relapse.

I did have to increase dose from 20mg to 30 mg after 2 years because it seem to lose effectiveness.  Overall, it has vastly improved my well-being.  That constant ""under-current"" of negative and fearful energy completely went away after 10 days to 2 weeks of using it. My manic episodes lasts a few days, instead of a week and are less dramatic.  The side effects are still there... constant drowsiness and diminished ability to reach orgasm.  But the benefits well outweigh the negatives. "

1694$Depression$9/14/2014 11:44:42 AM$Reviewer: Sabrina J., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$"I have suffered from depression and anxiety (most especially the latter) for a good portion of my life, but the last few months has been the worst bout of depression I have ever experienced.  Some years ago, I took Paxil, and it gave me the worst stomach pain and temporary restless leg syndrome, which was the most bizarre experience.  I was afraid to try another anti-depressant after my past experience, but I couldn't get out of the hole I was in, which just kept getting deeper and deeper.  It was to the point where when Robin Williams ended his life, I kept wishing it were me instead.  I went to my doctor because I had been battling sickness after sickness (strep throat, cold, flu, etc.) for several months, and told her about the funk I was in.  She told me that depression actually suppresses one's immune system, which would explain why I kept getting sick, so she prescribed Celexa, stating it may help to bring me out of the depths I had been in for so long.  I was hesitant.  I resisted for a couple of weeks.  But after the worst bout of crying and suicidal thoughts I'd had since this started, I decided to take half a pill (5mg).  I had a headache the next day, but not terrible.  Took another 5mg the next day, then upped it to the prescribed dose of 10mg.  I've been taking it for two weeks, and let me tell you, I haven't felt this ""normal"" in months... maybe years.  I have the occasional bout of nausea, but not terrible, and a headache every so often, but save that, it's been a miracle.  I don't plan on being on them forever, just until I feel like I can handle life on my own again.  However, I would recommend them to anyone who is suffering from what feels like Hell on Earth.  They work.  They work fast.  I can smile.  I can laugh.  I don't feel nervous or terribly sad.  I feel like me.  And that feels so good.  "

I have to say that so far this drug has been very hard for me to use. The side effects really make my depression and anxiety feel worse. I've lost a lot of weight and I cannot sleep. Recently, I've been feeling very harsh pains with the muscles in my legs. Sex is no longer an option. I have taken a few medicines for my depression and none of them have given me side effects like this. However, I think I'm going to talk to my doctor very soon and ask him if the side effects are really worth it to continue this medicine. I hear it's very hard coming off of it and I believe that. I am 18 and started off with 20 mg and the side effects only got worse when he upped me to 40mg. The side effects sometimes scare me.

I began taking it for general anxiety/depression.  It is amazing.  I have never felt better.  It has quieted my mind, took away the anxiety and negative self-talk that owned me for so long, and has made me more confident and focused than ever before.

The first night I took it, I felt an immediate difference the next day.  I felt a sense of calm and my mind was quiet.  After about a week, my wife noticed a total difference in me.  After the next few months, it just got better and better.  

I have had no serious side effects as others have mentioned.  The only thing I have noticed is that I am a bit more sensitive to alcohol.  That's not a big deal to me though at all.  I had slightly more vivid dreams for a couple of months but that went away.  

I have always taken it at night based on the doctor's recommendation and have had no issues.

Give it time.  My doctor said it takes a few months to fully feel the full effects.  She is absolutely right based on my experience.  It's an awesome drug.  Give it a chance if you feel you may need it, it might change your life.  I am a better husband and father for it."

I knew that I had a problem and felt ""the black hole"" coming on but for several years I just dealt with it.  Recently, there have been a lot of changes in my life and my doctor felt like it was time to try something new.  I was put on Celexa 40 mg.  I read the side effects when I first got the medicine (something I don't normally do).  I laughed at the fact that this medication could cause constipation.  Not only have I been depressed, but I have been constipated for about half of my life.  Although I was unsure about this particular side effect, I decided that it was better to be out of my black hole.  This is my fifth day on Celexa.  I have experienced nausea, sleep deprivation and headaches.  The nausea subsided after a few days.  My only concern is that I woke up this morning and couldn't see clearly.  I felt a film over my vision and couldn't even spuint to see better.  I looked up side effects once again and did not see blurred vision as a side effect.  I am hoping that as the day goes on, things will become clearer.  Over all, this medication seems to be working.  We shall see.  "

But now that I am back down to 40 mg, I am back on Wellbutrin. Only negtive side effect I had from Celexa the first couple of months I took it was extreme sleepiness to the point I would fall asleep at my desk at work even though I was getting 8 hours of sleep at night. After a few months, that side effect disappeared. Weight gain was about 10 lb total over the last 7 years, no big deal. I was anyway from the depression, so that was a good thing. Not even sure if the weight gain is due to Celexa. I would recommend Celexa as a way of taking the edge off depression and anxiety, you just need to make sure you find the right dosage amount for you. It has done a world of good for me!

After 3 months I upgraded the dose from 10mg to 20mg.  I have to say it has certainly helped my ability to cope with work and social situations.  Although I often hear warnings about changes in behavior. I have begun to not care about things and have really changed as a person and have actually made some bad decisions.  I don't know if this is a side effect or just the result of taking medication designed to alter your personality.

I wanted to comment my results so far for anyone in the same boat and will update monthly. The previous comments posted by users have been extremely helpful and appreciated. 

After this first month I have noticed no lessening of any of my depression symptoms. I had noticed a worsening if anything in the last two weeks but am unsure if this is related to the medication. What surprised me the most was for the last two weeks I have ended my sleep cycles on a horrible note. Vivid dreams of a negative sort forcing me to awake with a truly awful anxiety. I had no idea this could be caused by early use of this medication until reading here what other users had experienced, All cases I've read state this does not last so fingers crossed this side effect dissappears sooner rather than later. 

I have noticed no effect on my appetite or sex drive.

Will keep posted. I hope one finds this somewhat helpful. Cheers."

Nothing worked. Before Celexa I was on Lexapro, which is supposedly the newer, more 'refined' version of Celexa, and felt horrible. About 6 months ago, I decided to switch over to Celexa and have never felt better. I felt a difference right away (within a day or two). I am finally back to my happy, bubbly, chatty self. Other SSRIs that cut my anxiety made me feel 'flat'. Not Celexa. On Celexa I'm still able to feel my emotions-I can laugh and cry (when appropriate)-without feeling overwhelmed by them. I take it in the morning and have so much energy all day. I highly recommend this medication.

Stomach pain, nausea, loss of appetite and major bleeding issues. After getting only five hours of sleep in a thirty hour period, I started to taper off to 10 mg. Bleeding issues aren't as bad, sleep issues are better but I still have nausea and I don't feel hungry. I have to use the clock to tell me it is time to eat. Today I start the 5 mg dose and see doctor tomorrow, (she mentioned something about trying Lexapro when I called in with issues.). I tried taking it with food, no help.

I did have some weight gain which I never really associated with taking Celexa until I read some of these comments.  I no longer have the Low feelings and mood swings, though, so a little weight gain is worth it.

On 10mg day for about a month, so far so good. Side effects have been tolerable. Most noticeable was the nausea and loss of appetite for 1st 2 weeks. Have lost about 5 pounds, cravings for sugar and carbs are gone. Started taking at night a few hours before bed however, to try and deal with feeling unmotivated - that is about the only way I can describe it. I feel ""lazy"". The switch has been for a few days, and have noticed I feel more ambitious during the day, which is great. Issue now is headaches in the morning. My anxiety had been causing me chest pains and waking me up at night and the Celexa has completely helped that so it's been a godsend to have about 4 weeks of sleeping through the night, something I haven't had in about 4 years. So that in an of itself has helped with mood. In general, am happy with this, have noticed it does take more to climax, but hey, more nooky time isn't a bad thing :)"

1987$Depression$9/16/2012 12:18:20 AM$Reviewer: Beth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I had been through months of chemo and then had surgery. My family and my surgeon felt I was not acting happy enough that the cancer was gone and were concerned that I was still sad over losing my breast and still needing pain meds (even though I was down to half doses). I was prescribed 10 mg. I was so nauseated I could not eat, couldn't stay awake during the day, and finally started being awakened multiple times at night with panic attacks, which was the end of my taking it. First day off had major headache, after that I was back to myself. I unfortunately learned to limit sharing my pain at my loss to my support group and my journal, but my family was convinced the antidepressant was working until they found out I hadn't taken it for a week. I am now hearing that the few days I was on it must have really helped me for over a week and am being pressured to go back on it or get a different one. Even if I hadn't had side effects, I think the real problem in my case was (and is) that there are people in my life who are not willing to give me time to heal emotionally, although they are very supportive of my need to heal physically. Perhaps the side effects even saved me from a worse problem of trying to get off it later. I think doctors are too quick to reach for the prescription pad, especially if depression is clearly situational. Counseling and acceptance (and maybe some hugs) would have been better.

2026$Depression$6/22/2012 8:37:57 PM$Reviewer: ryan, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$I was on Celexa for about two years 40mg. The affect of helping my depression was great. Although you have no real emotions, when i quit taking it I started to cry one day and realized that I haden't even had that emotion in my body for two years. Thats great if you want to be a zombie and have no real feelings anymore. It felt sooo good to cry, I had missed it. I'm the type of guy that doesnt ever cry, and it was wonderful! I would not recommend this drug to anyone, unless you have been through some serious trama that you need to get through. Like I said you become like a zombie (no emotions)! You feel good all the time no matter what has happened in your life. If you want that, then this is the drug for you. Side effects were loss of sex drive totally!! My girl didnt like that at all!

After nearly 20 years of talk therapy --and a very toxic work environment --my new MD prescribed Celexa (I'm on generic form). It worked almost immediately for me --my anger, anxiety and apathy lessened, and my obsessive worries are nearly gone. Only side effect has been headaches and increased appetite (salty carbs and sugar). I can't drink any alcohol on it (that's fine). The benefits far outweigh the side effects! I wish that I had been less averse to taking medications; my anxiety & depression has been a constant battle since age 19.

She was started on 20 mgs then 40,then 50, then 60 and he wanted to take her to 80!  About 1 1/2 years ago I notice a change in her behavior.  My wife of 47 years was getting more distant and showed little or no affection.  Our relations are 0 now and we had always had a very affectionate and warm relationship, and that was gone.  The day it came to a head I put my arms around her in the kitchen one morning to give her a hug and she stood there like she was a robot with no feeling.  It hit me so hard for the rest of that day I though I would die of a broken heart.  This is when I started to to use Web MD to look into the meds that she was taking and found our what was going on because of the Celexa.  I talked to her Psychiatrist and he told me in so may words it wasn't any of my business and my wife was his patient.  ""What the heck about our marriage""?  I trusted these doctors and I feel they have made a bigger mess of my wife then when she started her treatment for depression.  I am glad after we had talked the doctor has changed her to Lexapro with Wellbutrin and the fog seems to be lifting, but she has a long way to go to get back to her normal self.  I feel that before our spouses are put on these medications the family members need to be brought in, and helped to understand what they need to do to be the support structure for the depressed member.  If the member getting the help loses the love and support of the spouse it will make things much worse for the for the marriage an relationship. I would like to see the family member have several sections together and maybe work through the depression if possible before the SSRI medications are prescribed,  I feel that the patient becomes addicted to these medications.  I love my wife very much after all of these years and I wish I would have been included with the therapy that she was being prescribed and not pushed on the side."

I am a male, 34, weigh 195lbs, with a very high metabolism. Diagnosed with GAD back in 2001 after a panic attack / excessive sweating (Hyperhidrosis) / general feeling that something bad was gonna happen (post 9/11?). Anxiety / Depression are in my family history. I have been taking .25mg of xanax as needed during this period of time with good results. After getting a new (and very stressful) job in May, it didn't take long for my anxiety disorder to intensify and lead to a higher level of depression, with the first ever suicidal thoughts coming over the holiday break. The stress of the ridiculous unrealistic expectations of my employer combined with the responsibility that if I mess up our soldiers lives are at risk was too much to bare. I began double dosing my xanax just to get thru the work day and drinking heavily after work almost daily. Mood swings were out of control and I would just cry. Decided to go on LOA and spoke with my PCP about my issues. She prescribed the Celexa and asked me to go back to taking the .25 xanax as needed instead of daily. I also began seeing a counselor who agreed with the PCP about trying Celexa. After my first dose yesterday I almost instantly felt some side effects. Nausea, stomach pains (mild), light-headed, excessive yawning, dry and bad taste in my mouth, shortness of breathe, and sweating of hands / feet / underarms is on a new level. Also feel lethargic and like a zombie. I will post again in a few weeks once I have more experience with the drug.

I had some unforseen circumstances that had me getting really depressed, unmotivated, and lack of energy, so my Dr. had increased my Lexapro from 10 mg to 20 mg.  When insurance became an issue I switched to Celexa 40mg.  When I had increased my Lexapro dose I found I was almost emotionless, and I found myself being forgetfull.  I also was experiencing a decrease interest in sex.  When I switched to Celexa those side effects disappeared.  I found myself being more motivated, feeling happy emotions again, and my sexual desire went almost back to normal.  I did notice when switching to Celexa that I experienced frequent yawning, but this went away after a month or so.  I have noticed that I have gained a bit of weight since I switched to Celexa, but I have not been on it long enough or gained enough weight to know for sure if Celexa is the reason.  I haven't had any change in my diet or activity level (I eat very healthy and i'm pretty active).  Overall I am very satisfied with this drug.  Although I was doing great using the lower dose of Lexapro, the Celexa worked much better for me when increasing the dose.  As with all anti depressants you have to wait 6-8 weeks to see the full effects and really know if it's working for you.

The doctor switched me to Celexa (citolapram) and I've been on it for about 2 years now for my depression and it has been working fin.  But like a dummy, I felt so good that I took myself off without speaking with my doctor and now I'm back to being depressed and had to be admitted to the hospital. They put me back on Celexa. Just been 2 weeks and still depressed. they told me that it will take about 4 - 6 weeks to be back. Hope so, for my sake and my family's. I'll never do that again!

Ten years of disabling diarrhea, episodes of such profound weakness and tiredness that I was brought to the ER.  Many, many tests and visits to specialists because of the digestive problems. Not a single one of these various physicians connected my distress ti citalopram.  For a few months now I have not taking this drug (yes, without the guidance of my doctor!) and for the first time in ten years I can leave the house without worrying about bathrooms. This class of drugs addicts slowly but surely and you will find it almost impossible to get off of it.

i began using Lexapro due to a lot of anxiety and mild depression.  I fought through the earlier side-effects (jitteriness, clenching my jaws, some suicidal thoughts but not intense) and then began feeling better (more relaxed and not dwelling on particular negative thoughts).  After a couple of years, I reduced dose from 10mg to 5mg.  After 3-4 years at 5mg, 
I then weaned myself off over a six month period.  Within a few weeks, I felt very irritable and a little out of control, emotionally.  My wife sent me back to the doctor and was prescribed Celexa 20mg.  It helped immediately.  I've taken it for the past year without any noticable side-effects.  I'm 58 and very active.  I do go to the local YMCA about 5 days a week and run about 15 miles a week on the treadmill as well as using other exercise equipment.  I am a big advocate of using exercise to treat anxiety and depression.  Celexa and exercise has been a good combination for me.  I had always been fit and trim before my son died.  I gained about 15 pounds and had trouble being focused to lose weight.  During the past year I have lost 15 pounds and feel much, much better.  I won't give Celexa all of the credit, but I think it has helped.  I would recommend it for mild/moderate depression and anxiety."

I only lasted on it for 11 days, not long enough to feel the benefits but I'd rather deal with mild depression and take something else for anxiety than deal with the horrible side effects. Excessive sweating, I feel miserable even on a nice cool day, agitation sometimes, very bad nausea, although it went away after 4-5 days, constipation, blurred vision, and very intense jaw clenching which causes me bad tension headaches. My jaw and even my whole mouth hurts because I am clenching my teeth unconsciously. I had similar side effects with Zoloft, but not nearly as bad. Celexa is terrible! Makes me extra tired, and the yawning is annoying. I would never try it again!

This has totally changed my life for the absolute better. I can control any mood swings I have, people notice I'm happier, I feel happier and more satisfied with life. I do get major headaches if I forget to take it more than 2 days in a row (I guess that is a good reminder to take it). I take it at bed as it makes me VERY sleepy and thus it helps me sleep. The only side effect I have is that I started talking in my sleep after I started to take this and the talking in the sleep has only gotten worse. I do not know I'm doing it but the ones who are around me notice that I'm doing it. It has killed my sex drive which I understand happens with a lot of anti-depressants but it totally took away my suicidal thoughts so I do not mind the loss of sex drive one bit. I'm happy that I found a doctor that put me on this and helped me find the right dosage so that I could return back to the land of the living.

I've told my dr that it does not work for me & instead of switching me back to Prozac or another medication she just increases the dose saying it will eventually work to help with my depression and anxiety. Also, she's the one who writes for my xanax which has tripled since taking Celexa! I'm trying to switch dr.'s now since she obviously isn't willing to listen to me about how unhappy I am on Celexa. Do Dr.'s get paid for writing for certain drugs? Very frustating!!

I don't have any side effects except for a slight panicky feeling early in the morning.  Otherwise, it has taken the edge off of my anxiety.  I am no longer irritable and panicked, and I can think clearly.  I have tried increasing the dosage but found that more than 20mg was too much.

I started with 20mg and bumped up to 40mg and felt no change at all. To me the side effects, though not severe, have outweighed the medicine itself because there hasn't been a significant change in my mood, level of energy or motivation. Sexual side effects have decreased a lot since I began taking the medicine, but I have felt some effects on my stomach and bowel movements and also my general short term memory.

Now when I must stay still during a ""big pain"" episode, it's no longer anything close to the end of the world. I'm happy now. I feel joy. I sing and (carefully) dance.

2263$Depression$7/7/2011 2:56:29 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  (Patient) $1$1$1$I was experiencing severe depression and my provider prescribed Celexa, with a beginning low dose. For several months, I had been limiting my food intake to lose weight and my protein levels were probably low.  I did not share this with my provider as I did not know that it could impact the effects of Celexa.  I took the medicine for 1.5 months, starting with a low dosage. I developed a severe skin rash that has been diagnosed as an rare skin disorder.  The rash is still present on my back, arms, legs, and in my hairline.  The itching is unbearable and predisone did not relieve it.  In reading these posts, I read one from the woman whose sister committed suicide while on Celexa and that Celexa had become toxic because she had been dieting and her protein levels were low.  I believe that the Celexa became toxic in my system. Tell your doctor if you are dieting prior to taking this drug and be careful.  Celexa also made me like a zombie.
2264$Depression$7/7/2011 10:53:18 AM$Reviewer: Amylein17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$5$This is a follow up review from July 2010. I took generic Celexa for 9-10 months. I gained about 10 pounds and was sleeping excessively. I would sleep 8 hours each night and still felt like I needed a nap every day. I went off this medicine to try ibuprpion to help me quit smoking. That was a failure-felt like a witch and it wasn't very effective at helping me stop smoking. After I went off ibupropion, I tried not taking any medicine, but rather supplements. I took 5HTP (for depression) and valerian root for anxiety for about a month. It helped a little, but not like AD medication. So I told my doctor I wanted something that made me feel like Celexa (happy, no worries, emotionally awesome), but that wouldn't make me hungry and sleepy all the time. She prescribed generic prozac which I've been taking for a little over a month. I really like it so far-normal appetite, sleeping ok, and feel good emotionally. I have noticed a bit of vaginal tenderness/inflammation, but I presume that is happening due to decreased frequency of sex. Other reviewers of generic prozac have said they've noticed it as well. As with Celexa, my libido has decreased, but that has actually helped since my partner has a weaker than libido than I did before depression hit. Overall, I'm very satisfied with generic prozac. Will follow up in the future if anything changes.

I was tired all of the time.  It made me feel high while it made my body rot away and become really weak.  I was encompassed by an all powerful apathy.  When I finally came to enough to ween myself off of this crap-it was like awakening out of a coma only to find yourself in another person's body.  I never had a weight problem before taking celexa.  I did not eat a lot while I was taking celexa, in fact it made me lose my appetite.  Exercise did not keep the weight off-it was a nightmare.  It has taken 4 months after stopping usage to get to a point to where the weight is finally coming off.  I was a very active dancer before usage-it destroyed the last thing that made me happy, MY BODY and my PHYSICAL STRENGTH.  It was not worth it.

I have been taking the medication for about two months and felt the drug working very early on. I can personally say that the drug has made me feel even more depressed at times. My anxiety has also worsened and have since developed a major fear of panic attacks (which have occured in the past). I have experienced feelings of hopelessness and the feeling that I will never have another happy experience again. 
   The drug has also seemed to have a negative affect on my sleeping patterns. I often wake up many times throughout the night and sometimes have trouble falling back asleep on account of sad or depressing thoughts and feelings.
    My experiences with this drug has proved to me that all antidepressants do not work for everyone. There is still a chance that the drug will worsen your depression. "

Citalopram (celexa) was first prescribed to me in 20mg, but later proved to be too much (caused me MORE anxiety than i began with) and I dropped down to 10mg/once a day. *Sometimes, going up in your dosage is not always the right answer!* This medicine has worked wonders. At first, the side effects outweighed the benefits but I stuck through it. I gained about 10-15 lbs. in 2 months. But I'm happy, and hopeful. Took about 4-6 weeks to fully see benefits. I've been on it over a year now and continue to take it, no side effects anymore. Be patient to allow the side effects to wear off AND allow the full potential of the medicine to show through :)


          - about 6 months after being on celexa (citalopram) my doc also prescribed Bupropion (generic wellbutrin) 150mg/once a day. I feel amazing! And i've lost the weight I put on from celexa!

I stopped on day 11 because I had a severe allergic reaction including facial swelling, hives everywhere, hands and fingers swelling.  It was horrible!  I'm still itchy despite being on 2 Rx and 2 OTC's for this reaction.  This combo cased me to gain 8 pounds in a week.  Also very groggy feeling.
Has anyone else had an allergic reaction like this?  I'd be interested to know if the Celexa/Welbutrin really caused this because you'd think it would show up sooner and not wait for 10 days.  I didn't eat any new foods, no new soaps or lotions, no new fibers in clothing, nothing out of my ordinary routine.  This has got me so puzzled!"

I was on it for about 5 weeks and if it weren't for all the bad side effects I would definitely still be on it because it worked better than Prozac, Paxil,and Lexapro.  But the nasty side effects included nausea, fatigue, nightsweats, muscle aches, no libido, itchy rashy skin and big red dry blotches all over my face.  It also caused me to have short term memory problems- I couldn't even remember what I had cooked for dinner the previous night.

It has worked wonderfully on my depression. I have more energy and stamina. I want to get out and work, as well as play. It has worked well for me.
2462$Depression$12/3/2010 4:51:09 PM$Reviewer: steve, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$"I have been taking 20mg Celexa for two months.  The medication has been a great help at relieving my depression, however, one of the annoying side effects is a constant ringing in the ears (tinnitus).  I tried reducing the dosage to 10mg a day but this did not stop the tinnitus.  One of the beneficial side effects has been increased stamina and endurance during sex.  My wife loves it. 

Before Celexa, I was on Zoloft.  There was no tinnitus with Zoloft, however, the constant diarrhea was awful.

2467$Depression$11/30/2010 12:35:47 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I only took the medication for about 4 weeks and was at the lowest dose since my doctor wanted to work me up to the effective dose to try and help reduce side effects. But even on the lowest dose I felt terrible on it. It didn't do anything for my depression, which the doctor said I wasn't at a high enough dose or had it in my system long enough. But I suffered from extreme nausea, had an extremely dry mouth all the time, and felt very tired on the medication. I had to switch from taking it in the morning to taking it at night. I'm now on Paroxetine which does not give me any side effects as it is an extended release so it's less harsh on your stomach. For me, this one was a no go. The side effects were just as horrible as my depression.
2470$Depression$11/26/2010 1:12:00 AM$Reviewer: memememe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$I've been on Celexa for about three months now. I take 40mg each night, because I feel like a zombie if it's taken durring the day. Celexa keeps my mood swings under contol. I am no longer having extreme highs and lows. However, the side effects are very hard for me to get use to. Some of which include, feelings of absent mind, sweating, blurred vision, and forget about ever having an orgasm again! I guess you should really read up on the side effects and weigh your option before taking.

When I skip doses I notice I get moody and anxious.  But when I take daily (before bed) I find I feel the best and VERY under control and happy.  It has helped and become a medication I'll have to take the rest of my life due to chronic imbalance of serotonin in my system after childbirth. I'm ok with this because it helps and everyone around me from family to coworkers notice a positive change in my attitude and behavior.

2492$Depression$10/31/2010 1:45:42 PM$Reviewer: Omega1697, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I started taking Celexa 20mg (generic citalopram, its a lot cheaper) The first week of August this year. I was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I take it once a day at night (with food to diminish any possible gastrointestinal side effects). I am feeling 100% better than I did just a few months ago. I could not be more satisfied with the outcome. Before, I could not sleep or focus on anything. I was nauseas and exhausted all of the time and I even felt so dizzy I couldnt drive or go to class. I am now falling asleep without the help of sleep-aids. I have energy again; I no longer sleep 8 hours and wake up feeling more exhausted than I did the night before. FOR ME this was the correct medication. NO MEDICATION IS CORRECT FOR EVERYONE. There are several negative reviews from individuals; take them with a grain of salt. Yes, the first week can be miserable on a new anti-depressant (you have serotonin receptors all over your body, including your brain, blood vessels and stomach. While your body is adjusting to the new levels of serotonin, you will probably feel nauseas and have a headache). You have to be patient though! After a week I could feel a difference, and after a month I felt great. I feel like my old self again. The only downside I can find with the drug is that I cannot drink AT ALL on this drug. As with most SSRIs, alcohol renders the medication ineffective because Alcohol occupies the same receptors in your body. Massive panic attacks came for an entire week after drinking moderately. I would happily give up alcohol for the rest of my life to NEVER feel the depression and anxiety ever again though. There are also sexual side effects, but for me they have been positive. I can now maintain an erection and have a healthy sex life. I also have no problem with having orgasms. Do not rule out any drug because of the reviews on here. Eventually, you WILL find the right drug for you :). HANG IN THERE!!

After a few weeks it definitely worked and helped with the symptoms of anxiety and major depression.  The most prominent side effects for me are excessive sweating and sexual problems.  I have no problem being aroused and performing, however I almost feel desensitized, it's harder to reach orgasm, less intense when I do, and semen production is drastically reduced.  Keep that in mind guys.

Very scared that I'm going to go backwards after putting up with the side effects of Celexa. I don't want to lose the quality of my life for a pill. Have to take Adavan to sleep and have decided it might be better to take that and the Arimidex at night and Celexa in the morning. Sometimes it seems the pills are scarier than the cancer.

I always gave up on them, finding no results whatsoever. This past year i started having panic attacks, feelings of doom, and just a general lack of hope and despair.  As I am reluctant to take pills everyday, I fought my doctor putting me on this medication. He encouraged me to give it a chance before giving up. I am 10 days into the med.  At first upon taking, I thought I was ""going crazy""..for two days after starting I had the worst panic attacks ever and insane insomnia .  But now all of sudden, I am sleeping through the night(albeit bizarre dreams), I do not feel the dread or doom, have lost 5 pounds, and feel optimistic about life.  I urge everyone to give it a chance.  It may not be for all, but it is already helping my life...will write again at 20 days out to report.  P.S. I have less desire to smoke, which is a GREAT plus!!

Hated all the side affects.I quit taking anything for a couple of years then went into the worst depression ever.I was so close to suicide and could not function at all. I started on 20 mg of generic celexa and was very sleepy but kept taking it because I was desparate. The sleepiness subsided but I still needed a little more help so the Doc upped my dose to 40mg a day. Now that the side affects have passed, I feel happier than I have ever been in my life and can now cope with everyday stress. I feel like a normal person for the first time.

2600$Depression$8/6/2010 11:59:11 AM$Reviewer: ladypixie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$"I have been taking this med for 3-4 years now with doses right up to 60mg/day. I didn't find that 60mg was any more effective than 40mg so have stuck at 40 for most of the time I have been taking it. 

I was prescribed this drug after taking many other anti-depressants which failed to help my mood, and as anxiety and panic were becoming more prominent in my depression we decided to try Celexa (citalopram). It has helped but only very slightly if I'm honest. I think for people who have mild-moderate depression it would probably be much more effective.

As it turned out I was diagnosed with Bipolar early 2009 and this is probably the reason why it hasn't been so effective for me, but I can confidently say that I have had no bad side effects with Celexa, and have found it one of the easiest SSRI's to tolerate in terms of side effects. 

Even though I have said I haven't noticed a massive difference from it, I have noticed that when I have tried to withdraw from it than my anxiety has become pretty bad again so maybe it has helped slightly more than I give it credit for! Regardless, I plan to continue taking it for the foreseeable future."

2626$Depression$7/16/2010 11:51:11 AM$Reviewer: beth, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has been the only drug that has ever even touched me for the better. I used to think Paxil worked because I didnt know how much better it could be with celexa but almost immediately I felt like a new and improved girl. I never had a major depressive episode just an underlying dysthymia(low level depression)since high school. I always thought that I was just unhappy and that was that. About 6 years ago I started taking celexa after lexapro made me have zero improvement. The rest is history. The most wonderful drug in the world. Did gain about 10 pounds but that was the beginning and I would rather be 10 pounds heavier and happier then 10 pounds thinner and miserable. Now Im the thinnest I've ever been. I came to the conclusion that when you start taking the celexa you relax and arent as crazy about being a half a pound more. I always thought the other drugs I took(paxil, prozac, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, buspar were working because I used to talk myself into the fact that I felt better when I felt no change. Celexa changed my life and showed me that its ok to try different drug and treatment modalities until something works because this is your life. You are worth it. Being happy is something we all(or at least I)was willing to give-up because I thought something was wrong with me because I never had much of an effect from anything. Take care people and take the time to find something that will help you!

Over the years, this effect gradually waned until it had no effect and switched to other brands. No real effect. Ended up on Zoloft. No help. after being off Celexa a few years, I have started again, hoping for a return of the old magic. Started at 20mg for 2 weeks. Am now on 40mg and will increase to 6omg next week. So far, no noticeable improvement. Will keep it up for a few months. Don't know what I will do then.

Then citalopram (generic) at 20mg.  Almost immediate relief (but event soon concluded, too).  That said, the spiraling, out-of-control despair, dread & nausea stopped.  With citalopram, it felt like I was blocked from obsessing about the recent unendurable concerns (I'll get cancer like my mother, the world is full of incomprehensible suffering, even if things are good for a time they won't last, there's no joy...)-- either I couldn't focus on them anymore or I was on a track where I could not derail into despair.  At the same time, sexual interest declined and even when aroused, I couldn't climax.    BTW, husband has urged me NOT to go off drug.  He said he'd rather give up sex than have to go through my being depressed again!  Dr suggested reducing amount to 5 mg/day.  Sex now is usually better but still infrequent.  Realize menopause could be responsible, too, not to mention boring old routines of a 25 year marriage!  Weight gain-- a little.  Could be menopause, too.   Then again, if the effect of citalopram is to prevent focus on the negative, it stands to reason that it would prevent focus on the positive (sex, getting things accomplished).  There are always trade-offs.

Originally was on Prozac for years but recently discontinued it and went on 150mg Wellbutrin but became more agitated I thought. I cut the Celexa dose to 10 mg. and that does help some. Very tired, draggy, somewhat lethargic and jittery.  I guess I need to give it more time.  Does anyone take these meds at night or is it best to take them in the morning?
2682$Depression$6/5/2010 6:14:22 AM$Reviewer: beautifulblackme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I used to think that taking meds for depression was not for me because of side effects other people told me about.i finally started feeling so bad that I talked to my doctor and he prescribed the 20mg pill.  It has truly worked wonders for me.  I find myself being in a general better mood all the time.  I smile a whole lot more and even feel like dancing with joy sometimes.  I have not noticed any negative side effect with this med so I will probably be taking it for years to come.  It works well for me and I would recommend it to anyone!
2685$Depression$6/3/2010 9:03:01 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $2$1$5$"I took Celexa for about a year and a half. At first I thought it was helping. I had been depressed for so long I don't think I knew what not feeling that way felt like. When my depression is bad I kind of feel like I have blinders on and there is blackness surrounding me, so the fact that that feeling was better I thought the Celexa was working. The longer I took it though, the more I began to realize that was not enough. Plus I wanted to sleep ALL THE TIME.  I would literally sleep all day and still sleep at night. I have back problems and my doctor had prescribed Neurotin and Buspar. These meds made the sleepiness even worse and did little for my back. 
After yet another fight with my husband about the fact that I was never in the mood for sex I begged my doctor to change my meds. She told me to wait another month and see if the sun coming out more now would help. It didn't so I got her to put me on Welbutrin which has helped with my depression and sex drive, but the side effects are really bad, so the search continues for an anti depressant that works and won't hurt my sex drive and doesn't have terrible side effects."

When I first started taking it I felt so much better. It wa a long time ago, so the only side effect I recall now was nausea. I was feeling better and wheened myself off of it. Well I have been having a tough time lately and my counselor told me to start taking it again. I dont feel that its working for me anymore, not really sure why it worked before and now its not... I feel that it is making me really tired and sleepy, no energy, dizzy and faintyat times. I think maybe I just need to try something different. But a year ago it worked great...

2711$Depression$5/14/2010 3:36:23 PM$Reviewer: Ricardo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$3$5$This medication has been very effective in relieving my depression and anxiety symptoms. These symptoms became lighter and lighter within 10 days of use.  After 2 weeks, both my anxiety and depression symptoms were completely under control. The only notable side effect has also been the most difficult to deal with. This drug actually prevents me from reaching climax during sexual intercourse. As orgasm approaches, I can literally feel myself hitting an emotional ceiling which prevents me from ejaculating. The amount of direct stimulation required to achieve orgasm greatly exceeds the capabilities of the female vagina; therefore, intense masturbation is the only way for me to achieve orgasm. Even then, the process can take several minutes and often, up to an hour.  This problem started within 10 days of starting my Celexa regimen.  Even when I take only half of the tablet, the emotional barrier is not diminished, and still makes orgasm/ejaculation extremely difficult to achieve.

My Doctor started me on the 20mg Celexa and it did o.k. but was still not taking care of the problem completely, Now I am on the 40mg and everything is great. Almost a week after I started taking it people started noticing that I was changing little by little, about 4 weeks after I was on it I knew there was a major difference in my life. I felt ""normal"" Nothing really bothered me, and when it did, I was able to handle it calmly and cooly without any major incidents. This drug has been a life changer for me. I am truely glad that My doctor prescribed it."
2776$Depression$3/8/2010 7:13:33 AM$Reviewer: Eva75, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I started on 20mgs and felt better but not as good as i waned to feel, so my DR had me begin on 40mgs and i feel great! I take it before bed and i am able to sleep,i can function in life without freaking out and snapping on people for no reason. My sex drive decreased for about six weeks but it has returned to normal, and i had sweating episodes for about a month and that has stopped all together. I did not experience any weight gain,in fact i am losing weight because i actually care enough about myself now to better my life. I had very few side effects and none that were bad. I knew that i had a problem with depression before i was never diagnosed and didn't want to rely on a drug to make me feel better but i had no other choice and i am glad i did. This drug has been an awesome addition to my life and well being! My sister in law is taking celexa as well at the same dosage as i am and had the same side effects and hers has stopped as well and is back to her normal self too. Stick with it the side effects can be annoying but once you get through them you feel alive again! Even if the effects were still present in me i would continue to take this medication. It really works!

2781$Depression$3/2/2010 12:08:24 PM$Reviewer: tenzero, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$Celexa has made a vast improvement over previous antidepressants including most recently Wellbutrin.  I had some initial sleepiness which after 3 months has resolved, after 6-9 weeks I began to feel dramatically improved. I also have chronic joint pain which required Lortab 7.5 up to 4 times a day.  I now require maybe one Lortab per week and feel energetic, calm, no arguements with my spouse, and good sexual function. I would heartily recommend this drug as alternative to other less effective treatments.

Later in life, in my mid thirties, I again had a bought of depression and was put back on Celexa. Although it has accomplishment the same outcome, an overall better sense of well being, I will say that I believe it takes 2-3 months before you feel the full affect.  I think this time around, I will stay on it as long as I can because it makes a significant impact in the way I prioritize things and the way I assess the impact of things and keeping it in perspective.

I had taken Zoloft a few years before for slight depression and discovered that the side effects were not worth taking it. I feel that Celexa has helped me deal with things in my life better and am generally satisfied with it. My friend at college also takes it and we both think that it makes you yawn a lot, even if you are not tired. I would also recommend taking it in the morning instead of at night, but this is just an opinion.

I was suffering from pretty severe depression. My depression has eased a bit and I am able to think more clearly. I am tired through the day so I may start taking it at night. I have noticed that my sex drive has come back. It became non-existent from the depression so that’s nice. A few years ago I was taking Prozac and that didn't help at all. Plus it killed my drive and may have even made my depression worse. I like what I see so far with Celexa.

Never do that!! Getting back on it feels awful, but taking it continuously really helped improve my mood & overall outlook on life. I fortunately did not gain weight since I was happier & more active. I Had a better self motivation to get out of the bed every morning & much easier time getting along with everyone, especially my co-workers since I work in a stressful environment, the ER. I had tried other antidepressants that just did not agree with me or made me feel as if I was walking around in a fog. But once I started taking celexa, I had no real side effects & I actually started to be able to live my life without the high stress levels, & my OCD accompanied with anxiety has been at an all-time low. I can say I am very satisfied :)

After a few weeks it got better and now i dont experiance the side effects anymore.  it has really helped my mood swings, and has allowed me to let the 'little' things go. Tho, at first that was hard for me because i wouldnt get upset over the things i used to get upset about and that would frusterate me. But eventually i learned that i was alright.

It certainly made my relationship with my wife, two young children, and my mother less than enjoyable, to put it mildly. I enjoy music again, and laugh a lot more. Gaining and maintaining a healthy looking weight has always been tough for me. I look better a little heavier and Celexa has increased my appetite and allowed me to gain 15 much needed pounds (I'm 170# now). I don't get NEARLY as upset at life's challenges. I started with 20 mg for about 3 months, but increased to 40mg and feel a lot better. I came off the meds for about 6 months and the old angry me came back. Oh well...whatever it takes for improve the LIFE experience. The only significant side effect I have is the ability to achieve orgasm. Erection is no prob but the O seems next to impossible. I tried wellbutrin for a few weeks to help with the O's but seemed to experience more aggression, so I quit that. Aside from that...this stuff is heaven sent.

After 2 months I lost 20lbs and actually felt better...Major side effect would be loss of libido...my sex drive that was already low because of depression and anxiety became non existent because of celexa.

After we seperated I was mildly depressed and I couldn't do much because I felt like I was in a fog. I couldn't concentrate on anything. Thinking was a major chore. It was horrible. I was put on celexa and felt better within a week or two because I was able to think clear. However I still felt depressed and unmotivated, but at least now I could think better. Another reason I didn't care for it is because it made me really anxious. I suffered from some anxiety before and this seemed to not help with anxiety. I was nervous alot of the time, my jaw was clenching, and the main thing I couldn't tolerate this drug was because of the major neck pain. It was hard for me to fall asleep because of my neck pain which started within a day of taking celexa. I say if you have anxiety, this might not work for you, but everyone is different. I read alot of the reviews and it seems it worked for alot of people, but not for me. I am trying Lexapro next.

I started out with 10mg/day for a week and then increased to 20mg/day. I was on this medication for about 2 months. I experienced an in ability to achieve orgasm during sex. I simply could not have one. But I had an increased sex drive, so it was a two edged sword. Also I don't know if it really helped my depression. I wasn't wanting to lay around all day anymore. but I was Angry ALL THE TIME!!! If someone or something made me angry that is all I could think about. I have since stopped taking the medication and my depression has returned but I am not as angry. I hope this information helps other people taking or considering this medication.

This medication works really well. I am on 40mg/d. I do experience some extreme sexual side effects from this drug (unable to ejaculate during sex). However, after doing some research I found a way around it and wanted to share. I take my 40mg dosage RIGHT before bed (I am sexually active with my girlfriend almost every night, so I take the medication after sex). While it is still ""difficult"" to achieve an orgasm, it is definitely not impossible. So, I just take the pill as late as possible, and then next night (about 18 hours after last dose) I have no problems. I hope this helps some of you. "

Both the generic and the regular have the same side effects I guess. The first day i took it i felt a little odd. But over time, about a week I started noticing I could focus better and not repeat thoughts over and over again. The only problem that I have had with it, are my legs bother me alot when I'm laying down and sitting for even a few minutes. Also known as Restless Legs Symptoms. This is a side effect, and sadly it did effect me like that. Overall the drug worked pretty good on me, but I am changing to Zoloft, to control more of my anxiety.

Before Celexa, I had severe depression and extreme anxiety that would merge into full blown panic attacks. Celexa has been a life saver for me. The effectiveness has, of course, worn off some because I have taking it for so long but I refuse to taper off of it. I do not want to experience the severe depression and anxiety that I once experienced a long time ago. I do feel depressed at the moment and have anxiety as well (It has lost it's effectiveness), so my doctor has also prescribed me Xanax as needed and another anti-depressant called Pristiq. I have only tried Prestiq for 5 days but already do not like the extremely negative side effects I am experiencing so I plan to stop taking this. The Xanax has helped tremendously with my anxiety. I wished I could just keep increasing the MG of Celexa, but my doctor told me I am maxed out. I may research this and see how many MG is the max for this medication. Oh yeah, this medication has not caused any major side effects for me, even in the beginning. My sex drive is still as great as ever.

Scared me so badly that I quit taking the prescription for two months.  Just re-started two weeks ago, was cutting the 20mg dose into half and then half again!, and this made my side-effects less acute.  It will take me longer to get to where I am hoping to be with my depression, but the panic attacks aren't worth it. Just increased to 10mg two days ago and last night had an awful time trying to fall asleep - racing thoughts, anxiety...the scariest part was the feeling of heat through my chest, arms and face (like an acute hot flash or sunburn?).  It actually woke me up several times, this hot-flash symptom, and I would be drenched in sweat....wondering if anyone else had this side-effect too? I am hopeing that it goes away soon!  Had such good luck with my last anti-depressant but it's $90 more a month than Celexa.  Am looking foward to ""sunnier""-feeling days!"

A littel advertised side effect is ""disinhibition"". This caused me to make inappropriate comments and swear more etc...very weird! Unfortunately I lost my job over it before I discovered the cause and stopped taking the drug. When I stopped I found I was not depressed as badly as when I was on it and the anxiety had gone as well... this drug can be useful for short term use prior to counselling to deal with rather than bury the issues. I was also suffering from what is quaintly called ""suicidal ideation"" as I was convinced my family would be better off without me...really bad shit I think you'll agree! The reason for the disinhibition is that serotonin (which this drug increases in the brain to make you happier allegedly) is involved in your internal behaviour regulation. Really look out for this and the suicidal thoughts if you are taking this stuff esp long term.. at least it didn'tmake me sweat as much as Prozac did! good luck out there everyone."

I began it in June 09 at 20mg because I was feeling sad and depressed out of the blue.. Have never had depression ever before. So De. says try this.. After a week, I felt nausea constantly-felt just ill. By week 2- I began having ear pain and headaches with the nausea/loss of appetite and most days felt unable to function- went to Dr to see if I had ear infection. No-- asked if it could be the meds. Again NO..By week 3- I had lost 24 pounds. I was then waking up with indigestion (mind you I was barely eating), constant nausea, fatigue, headaches, feeling of absolute illness- Went again to Dr. asking is this the meds doing this..Again NO.  Began getting freaked that I had some sort of disease that I was gonna die or something. Spent most days on couch, sick as hell. Finally week 4-more weight loss, feeling weird crazy thoughts, didnt trust myself, afraid- worried, felt like I was going insane and this with all the physical complaints. At end of Week 4, I said I quit this med.  I stopped it, went to see my hemotologist in tears begging him to see if I had cancer or something (brain tumor) because I have never had headaches like that ever. Told him about the Celexa  and that the day before I stopped taking them. He looked at me and said, IT IS the MEDS..Told me about the half life and give it time to get out of my system. Sure enough less than one week later, I felt 100 times better. He offered for me to try Wellbutrin but I was super afraid of the same thing happening. So I declined. However again about 2 weeks ago began feeling sad, depressed, weird gloomy out of the blue--all my blood hormone tests are normal- so called the  Hemotologist and saw him. began taking the Wellbutrin 150 about 4 days ago. The only thing I noticed I felt a little better, some energy,little irritable today..Will see how it goes. I am taking a half dose of .5mg of xanax as well, since I am nervous about the side effect

I am at work where we get internet access. My wife is 32 yo has been  diagnosed with PTSD, Bi-Polar, multi-personality disorder, anxiety, hypo thyroid disease, and depression. She is on abilify, clonazepam, levothyroxin. She was taking nerotriptilyn to help with sleep disorder but was removed from this and incresed the clonazepam at night. Been on Celexa for just over a week. At first she was tired all the time (was taking meds at night), then switched to mornings. That day she sleept all day long. Since that day, she has been not sleeping that long. She is smiling more and less talk about how she wants life to end or dwelling on the anxiety of life. She yawns a lot, but that is becoming less. The biggest problem she feels (and this is coming from her) is that she has a lack of sexual desire specifically decresed interest in sex and sexual ability. This fact is giving her a whole new and other reason for being depressed because sex is a part of our marriage that we both love. So has any married couples experienced this and have the sexual effects balanced out. Celexa works awesom for my wife, she has such a beautiful smile and laugh. I am falling in love with her all over again and it is great, just want the ""other"" effects to stop. "

Im having a lot of side effects. Neausea, dry heaving, Dizzyness, Feeling ""Drunk"". But it has helped with the depression a lot. My family has noticed a big change in my personality.

2973$Depression$9/25/2009 1:51:03 PM$Reviewer: ChrisInMidwest, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$"I was taking 20 mg of Lexapro before I switched to Celexa just over 3 wks ago. Lexapro had really helped me with my depression, but it was too expensive ($93/month) and it raised my sex drive very high. My sex drive is normally good, but on Lexapro it felt like I was 15 again-which sounds great, but it was very distracting to say the least. 
So I switched to Celexa. The only effect I liked was a normal to at times, a reduced libido, which felt alright.
The other side effects were awful: headaches, very tired, irritable, and, worst of all, brain ""fog' all day. My memory was just shot, because of the fog- far worse than anything I'd experienced before I'd taken any anti-depressants. 
I'm switching to a different med today once I hear back from my doctor's office, for hopes of a better outcome. Just a note to consult your dr when you switch medications, I made the mistake of not letting them know what I was going through and stopped cold turkey a few days ago. Now I'm even more irritable and my wife's not too happy with me, to say the least.  "

2978$Depression$9/21/2009 4:34:12 PM$Reviewer: LifeinProgress, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$"Have been struggling with a severe case of depression for sometime, to the point where I have had sucidial thoughts and basically do not see the point in living...Finally accepted that I needed to seek professional help. Have tried Lexapro, Effexor and  Wellbutrin in the past for a very short time frame, all 3 gave me excrutiating headaches so I stopped taking them, not to mention severe anxiety and a general 
""weirded out"" feeling.
Have been taking Celexa 10mg for about 3 weeks now. I can tell you that I have not had headaches with the 10mg. My doctor wants to bump me up slowly to 20 or 40 mg, however, when I took 15mg, the headache was unbearable. My doctor suggested that I take it with two tylenols, which so far has been helpful. Haven't noticed a huge improvement in the depression, but I would say I am hopeful. Also, after reading some reviews, I started taking Celexa at night, so I am not groggy durig the day.
As a side note, I am also someone who eats very healthy, works out daily and has a lot of family support. Thus, I hope that I will be able to be on Celexa long enough to dig out of what I like to call my depression, ""the black hole"". 
Trust me, if you are sensitive to medications in general, especially AntiDepressants, Celexa may work for you. I pray that someone reads this and find it helpful!!"

This time it didn't seem to be working.  I also was hit with overwhelming anxiety because of my husband's job difficulties.  The doctor prescribed Celexa a couple of months ago.  After 3 weeks, I was ready to give up on this because it took longer to kick in than Zoloft. I also had terrible dry mouth and food just didn't taste good. But the Dr. bumped me up to 60 mg. and that really did the trick.  I only have dry mouth when I first wake up in the AM and food tastes good again.  My hubby said that on Zoloft I was more ""flat emotioned"" but on the Celexa, I have the normal ups and downs that everyone else has.  The only negative is that I am on the tired side, but not terribly bad.  It is a lot better than wanting to jump in front of a bus.  The best part is that a one month supply is only $4 at Walmart.  I urge everyone to give this a try and stick with it.  Good luck!"

With this in mind, I resigned myself to the fact that I must continue to suffer the rest of my life,with this debilitating disease. Approx. 3 1/2 weeks ago, I relented and had asked my Dr. if I could try-(after 5 years of suffering w/o any meds), ""Celexa"". He agreed and put me on 20mg, 1x day. In the first week,I could feel a difference, a positive difference. 3 weeks later, Celexa has made a significant change with not only how I feel but also, my outlook on life.I can only conclude,that not only have I found ""the one""-(Celexa), but with the help of your ""readers reviews"" and their experiences while using this drug, I have a renewed outlook on life, and freedom for the first time from horrible and debilitating disease!

I used to get teary eyed for no reason. Since I've been on it I've never had a problem with it at all. I think it even helped me go through menopause. Because I never had any sweats and I didn't have many mood swings. (my husband thanked the doctor for that) I just stopped taking celexa about a week ago, so I'll have to see how it goes.

3076$Depression$7/7/2009 1:32:18 PM$Reviewer: RogerBaran, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I like this drug much better than Paxil. I have been on Celexa now for over 2 years and noticed improvement right away: Time didn't seem so collapsed -- I had ""room to think"" and a lot less ""knee jerk"" reactions to situations. 

My only concern is when I forget to take it -- the pressure in my head builds substantially and I feel very fatigued. However, with that warning sign I remember to take it immediately and I am ok again within an hour or so. If I don't take it for some reason (away from the house) then I seem to release the ""Darth Vader"" in me and I can become pretty unpleasant -- to anyone who happens to be around me at the time.

I have remedied the above situation by setting a special ringtone to an alarm on my cellphone. It goes off every day at 7:00am. When I hear that special ring I know to check myself to see if I have taken my medications.

Overall, I really like the way Celexa helps me manage life; way better than before. I also benefit from the return of my sex drive; which was almost totally gone while using paxil. All of the other drugs that I sampled seemed to have side effects that were unpleasant in one way or another. Not Celexa. It comes on mild from the start and smooths out the path quite nicely. By the third week or so I knew that I would stick with this drug."

Life threw so many hard things at me that I was sobbing,worrying ALL the time. I was very tired and had litle or none of my creative spirit. This drug has stopped all that.  I am back to being energetic and creative and smiling :)Am much more able to handle the traumas of life; spouse wiht cancer, teenagers, step children, etc.... I do have emotions but they do not rule me.  I am on 10mg/day.  Do miss a more satisfying sex life but at least we have one now.  Before Cylexa-too emotional or angry to try!  Also, I am better able to support- emotionally- people who need me as well as find joy for myself.  Initially thought I'd try for 9 mos.; now thinking another year might be a good idea.

I can tell you this because I havent felt any changes in me! I still feel terrible and unable to even be active!! I'm coming off of it slowly but fair warning not for the treat for Bi-Polar!!!!

I can't get up too quickly or even move my head too fast without feeling dizzy. Plus even if it was better for my depression my sex life with my husband sucked!! Over all I think that it worked only in my head because I so needed something to work at the time. The side effects are not worth it. The way I feel after only 2 days off of it are just nut's. Imagine if this drug affects someone more than me they could wind up in the hospital!!!

3101$Depression$6/17/2009 12:29:55 PM$Reviewer: KMartin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"4 years on Celexa.  It stopped the intense, uncontrolable, non-stop sobbing.  This drug tamed the excessive ruminating.  My angry, impatient, always-irritable personality was replaced with a sweet mellowness. My suicidal ideations ended. 
I took this medicine because of some very seriously painful life events. 
This drug saved my life.
The initial side effects: tense jaw, yawning, insomnia, and others, went away fairly quickly.  Celexa kicked in within a week.  This medicine numbed my horribly raw, painful, extremely depressed feelings. I could not stop crying, for literally a year before starting Celexa.  My ruminating was like torture.  I was wonderfully mellow and fairly happy once again.
Long term effects included being pretty much emotionless.  I could not cry even if I wanted to.  My passionate, creative characteristics faded away.  I loved to sleep. My ambitions waned. I was definitely sugar coated and in my own little content, semi-zombie world.  But, I really needed that at the time....really, really needed it.
I think I gained some weight too while on Celexa.  Hard to pinpoint exactly why.
I decided to stop Celexa just 2 1/2 weeks ago.  I am thinking that I might be able to, maybe, not need it anymore.  I am going to try anyway. I want to get some of my old ambition back...my creativity....I miss the good intense feelings of love for my family.  I was kind of flat when it came to that. I was on 40 mg...Took 20mg for a week...then 10 mg for 3 days...now, zero meds. It was easy at first. Now, the brain zaps, whooshes are plentiful.  I feel sad and teary at times.  But that is ok...I am not afraid to cry....I think I just need to get used to emotions again.  I was very nauseous the first 10 days.  That is gone now.  I do have to stomach cramps now.  I am irritable, very tired, and just don't feel so great, overall.  But I am hoping all this will ease away eventually.  I sure am going to give it a good shot!  Quiting smoking was much harder!! LOL!

I am not sure what I may need, but I think I know that this isn't it.  It has been over a month now and up to a dosage of 40.  I don't think I want to stay on it.

I started on 20mg a day and after 3 weeks got upped to 40mg. I use to be very anxious and I guess depressed. I had intense mood changes as well. When i was on the 20mg my anxiety was more or less gone but my depression and mood was still the same. Ive been on 40mg for about a week and a half now and feel amazing! I havent felt this great in years. And I've lost 9 lbs! I know everyones experiences are different but I found it helpful to read reviews when I first started.

As for side effects for the first week i felt like absolute crap. Headache, sick, no appetite what so ever, shaky, kind of tippy on my feet...but those have faded. I do have a little bit of a metallic taste in my mouth at times but nothing unbearable...

3114$Depression$6/8/2009 11:19:40 AM$Reviewer: NeverAgain, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$2$5$After being diagnosed with a chronic illness I suffered from extreme depression and was prescribed 20mg of Celexa which seemed to work initially.  No sexual interest.  Unable to maintain erection.  Also made me unable to climax.  Eventually the medication seemed to stop working, so my Dr. prescribed 40mg.  Didn't notice much difference other than my abililty to climax returned but my interest in sex is NOT there.  I haven't been able to have sex in a year.  To aide the celexa, and after a suicide attempt, my Dr. also prescribed 150mg of wellbutrin.  This combo proved to be effective for a while with me taking the celexa at bedtime and the wellbutrin in the morning. Eventually that became less effective also so my wellbutrin dosage was increased to 300mg (2 150mg tablets) and I was advised to taper off of celexa by taking 1/2 a tablet at bedtime for a week, then 1/2 tablet every other day.  My withdrawls have been pretty bad...I experience muscle tremors, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, loss of appetite, headaches, and an inability to focus because of the symptoms.  I would recommed exhausting every possible avenue to treat depression without medication because eventually you're left over-medicated, and miserable because of side effects or withdrawls.  I plan to continue tapering off of celexa and then work at tapering off of wellbutrin.  I'm also planning to find a new therapist or some sort of support group, and start going back to church because I still don't feel like I'm living.  I seriously hope something I've said resonates, and helps someone to make an informed decision about their own treatment options.  Gotta go lie down because I just vomitted and my head is pounding.  BE WISE and BE WELL!!!

Side-effects seemed pretty intense, sexual being the most pervasive, decreased drive, pleasure, and an inability to reach orgasm really bothered me. It made me apathetic and affected my schoolwork negatively. Tiredness was common, I found it VERY hard to wake up in the morning, and if I could be awake enough, I usually didn't care enough about anything to wake up.  In my experience a good drug for a step up, to get things back on track, but not a permanent treatment for me.

During the holidays in 2008 I had severe depression and felt utterly hopeless.

I take Xanax at .25 for public speaking or for situations that I know will be stressful in advance.

Normally I do pretty well with this combination.  Lately though I have been so tired during the day that I have trouble getting out of bed and staying at work: I want to just sleep until I have had my fill.  Not as in the mood for sex as I used to be which is just fine with my wife.  Given being overly tired/feeling overly exhausted versus being severely depressed, I'll take the exhaustion.  As someone who is suffering from depression, it would be nice to have something without all the side effects."

I'm not as moody or irritable as I was. Before, I would yell or just start crying for no reason at all. The only side effect that I've had from taking this medication is being tired and yawning alot. But it is well worth the outcome.

3175$Depression$4/16/2009 2:21:41 AM$Reviewer: harnessingtheinsanity, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$"I've been on celexa off and on for 11 years for depression, panic disorder, GAD, etc. I hate to credit a med with giving me my ""life"" back, but having struggled with these conditions since childhood I have tried everything else known to man and still wound up on meds. Combined with CBT, celexa has brought me down to 10-20 panic attacks a year, as opposed to 10-20 a day. It sedates me a bit, and inspite of diet and exercise I have gained 50lbs on it. Like others have mentioned it has caused increased sweating, dry mouth, slightly decreased sex drive. On the upside,unless i tell them nobody would ever know i suffered from any mental illness. I also responded well for years to Desipramine, ok to lexapro, poorly to prozac, wellbutrin, topamax,and when unmedicated (by choice) found st. John's Wort to be slightly helpful (might help a person with less severe conditions). I would recommend Celexa in spite of some of the bothersome side effects, especially when the alternative in being so seriously ill as to be unable to work, eat, leave the house, socialize, sleep, drive, or even think ""clearly"". I would say it is one of the more tolerable medications."

I got up to go to the restroom and fainted 2 times on my way back to bed.  The 2nd time I fainted I didn't even know I was on the floor.  It was just a wierd feeling inside.  I didn't know it than, but I started to experience the 1st panic attack ever, and though I only took the med once (10mg) I continued to have some panic attacks and am now on clonazapam to treat panic attacks and seroquel to help me sleep.  So what is being treated now?  Not the depression, but anxiety attacks.  This drug was not a good fit for me, but everyone is different.

It is not all the time, but I will start to sweat a great deal with little effort such as sweeping the kicthen floor.  Willing to deal with it due to how much better I feel.  I experience some headachs at the start and blurred vision, only lasted a week or so.  Not serious.  Continue to get minor headachs, do not know if attribuated to medication or not.

The first day I took it I was light headed, thought I was going to pass out. My eyes were sensitive to light and I felt sick to my stomach. I also felt tingling on the side of my head. These symptoms only lasted a day or so and then I was completely fine. Celexa has helped me gain confidence in myself and to become a social butterfly. I did feel tired at first also, but I now take the celexa at night and feel fine throughout the day. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has anxiety issues. Do not let the first day discourage you, stick to it and it should help.

I have been on this pill for about three weeks and have seen its benefits work right off the bat for me. My family repeatedly says to me about this ""glow"" they keep seeing on my face and how I seem to look more ""peaceful"" since my Celexa therapy began. Personally, I have more energy, am able to concentrate better at work and am more chipper than I used to be in the past. I have been researching this drug right after I started taking it and read about the many different ways people react to it. I have had some sexual side effects (that would be the only drawback), but they turned out to be not as bad as I initially thought. Furthermore, this drug has also helped me with overeating secondary to the anxiety. I am not sure there is such a thing as the ""perfect drug"", but I think Celexa comes pretty close to it. "

3282$Depression$2/2/2009 11:54:34 PM$Reviewer: Goboard, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I've been taking 20 mg celexa for 2 months now and I'm much happier and more content than I've been for about 5 years. It took about 3 weeks to fully kick in but I definitely noticed a strong difference in my overall mood. When I do feel depressed now (rarely) it seems to be a bit more intense than before I began celexa, then again It's the middle of winter in Maine so who wouldn't be violently depressed. I highly suggest trying this drug if you are severely depressed, it saved my life.
3287$Depression$2/1/2009 11:20:55 AM$Reviewer: RaymondOKC, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$3$"After taking Celexa for just a couple of weeks, my wife and I both noticed a change in my behavior for the better.  I was less stressed, didn't contemplate negative thoughts as often, and was overall a more ""happy"" person.  I quote happy because it has always been my belief that depression is cause by actual occurrences in life, and the only way to truly cure yourself of depressive thoughts is to face the things that are difficult to face and ""take care of them"" thoroughly.  I feel that the drug simply makes things ""easier to deal with"" than it actually makes you happy or less depressed.  However, after nearly 3 months of drug therapy, I crashed very hard.  No suicidal thoughts, but I was ready to quit my job and divorce my wife even though we have three small children.  This episode didn't last even 24 hours, but it was one of the worst I had experience in my life.  This drug also made me extremely tired.  I simply could not get enough sleep almost as if I were a teenager once again.  After my ""crash"", I went off of the drug completely cold turkey.  During the first week being off of the drug, I felt almost drunk or high with a fuzzy state of mental being and a constant woozy feeling in my head.  During the second week, I suffered what I will call ""brain zaps"", nothing painful but once every 1-2 minutes I would get a quick ""unbalanced"" feeling in my head that would last no more than a second.  It is now early in my third week of being off of the drug, and the brain zaps are waning, but my feeling of lack of good sleep is still very persistent."

It's been 2 days (I only took the medicine once) and I still feel out of sorts, sick and shaky. If you are sensitive to medication i do not recommend Celexa. This has been a miserable couple of days.

I feel good and happy and well adjusted but not manic or hyper, and the side affects are nonexistent.  I take it with Xanax to help with the anxiety component of depression and Celexa has by far been the most effective antidepressant for me.  It also comes in generic form (citalopram) so it is less expensive.

Like others who have posted reviews of Celexa, I feel that I have a little less energy than usual, I tire more easily, and my appetite has decreased. These are mild side effects and I do not forsee them causing me to stop taking Celexa. I enjoy the fact that I've lost weight, as it definitely makes me feel good to have people comment on how thin I look! As far as my sex drive, there has been a decrease on my part, but my husband and I did not have sex very often before I started this drug, so it really hasn't been as issue. Overall, I feel much more at ease with life in general. I recommend this drug to others who are dealing with depression.

I have tried so many other anti-depressants, zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin and none of them really helped get me back to my normal self. Finally after adding Celexa 20mg to my Wellbutrin 450mg I am starting to feel like the person I was beofore I had my daughter.  I makes me not sleep so well, so I take it in the morning when I get up.  I don't have many complaints except for not being able to have an orgasm during sex.  Which is a big problem.  But so far this is the only thing that has seemed to help.

She had no other problems and a normal life.  She was liked by everyone and give of herself to all.  She committed suicide while on this drug!!!  She was not eating, which drasticaly reduced her protein level, causing this drug to become toxic.  I believe with all my heart, ANYONE taking these kinds of drugs MUST tell their medical health providers EVERY LITTLE THING which is not normal for you!!!!  I know she would be here today, if her medical professionals were aware of her suicidal thoughts.  SPEAK UP and stick around....there are many who will miss you terribly!!

My doctor didn't believe it, but I'd read a lot online, and it was absolutely true.  I slowly weened myself off the medication for several months, and still, I got the odd jolting sensations, and otherwise felt very strange for a good several months.  Honestly, I don't think I felt completely normal for a good six months.  I think the drug helped me, but coming off of it was not fun. And honesty, anyone who thinks they're going to stop using it cold turkey is nuts.  Just do what people tell you, slowly ease off of it over a period of months, not weeks, and it will be weird, but eventually you'll be fine.

I have been on this tiny pill for a few years and I am so much better if I take it properly. Who cares if you gain 10 lbs? It is all about GETTING BETTER and that's the only reason to take and CONTINUE taking this medicine. If gaining a few pounds is the main thing you're worried about, you really have no major problems to medicate. I was clinically diagnosed with depression about 7 full years ago and I see a much better difference in my life while on this medication. I do not drink or even take Tylenol for minor pain; I was very scared about being on a ""pill."" If you are depressed, seriously depressed, don't hesitate on getting all the help you can get NOW. If you're reading this, that means you believe that something out there can help. Guess what? There is. "

I am on the generic version citalapram. I first was taking the generic version of Zoloft for about 4 months until I ended in the Psychriatric hospital for attmepting suicide. My doctor switched the medication to citalapram at that time and I have experienced the worst side effects, extreme hot flashes through out the day and night, nauseated during the night (severe feeling of vomiting), loss of appetite, food cravings for fast food, lost of interest in exercising ( I use to exercise 5 days per week), difficulty waking up in the morning for work, insomnia (unable to sleep), vivid dreams, nightmares, talking in my sleep (never use to do this before), anxious while at work, lost of interest in my career, depression has increased, and weight gain. Time to change medication and doctor because this is ridiculous. I rather just continue Therapy than take medication. About 4 years ago I had depression really bad and I never had to take medication, only Therapy, Therapy helped me a whole lot. My believes is medications is so overated, Therapy is the answer for me.  I am not happy with my current life on this medication. Good luck to all of you who swear by this medication, as for me I will be taking the Cognitive Behavioral approach to recovery for my depression,anxiety, and panic disorder.
3419$Depression$10/21/2008 4:18:20 PM$Reviewer: Suy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$5$"I've had (undiagnosed) chronic depression as an ongoing background for years. Then last year I landed in a terrible work environment and chose to leave it, in a way that ended rather traumatically. I went to consulting and the shrink freaked out saying I am so depressed I must go on meds now. I was hardly sleeping every night. 

I went to my M.D. who was also enthusiastic about the treatment. ""You will still be yourself"", he said. He chose Celexa and put me on a very low dose (10 mg).

Well, I bought a month's worth and took it... for six days. Yes, the pain and self-immolation inside my mind were numbed. BUT The last thing I can say is that I was myself. I was definitely NOT.

Where to begin?
- I am a morning person, off and running as soon as the alarm goes and sometimes a bit before that on most days; suddenly I would roll around in bed unable to switch my mind on for an hour.
- My sexual appetite is quite healthy and wide-ranging. Overnight it was simply gone. I had never felt anything like it.
- Perhaps worst of all: I am a researcher. I use my brain for a living. I write research articles. But suddenly, by brain became a fuzzball. I could not think for one minute straight. Not because I had other stuff on my mind; because it became a fuzzball.

This thing seems to work for other people, maybe they are less sensitive to drugs in general. I know I am, and with all the pain, anger and depression I prefer to be myself than the numb slob I became when on this thing.

The good thing about stopping after such a short while is that the ""chill-off"" period was much shorter. Yet, 3 days after getting off Celexa I had a day of worse depression than I had ever felt. But that was it.

Since then I exercise on a daily basis, put a lot of effort into my research, and try to move my life back on track. It will never be easy - but believing that ""you can take a pill and it will be better"" is in my view no different than becoming a drug addict."

Downside is I have been experiencing some side effects that I hope go away.  I have gained weight, but that could also be due to stress levels, and I have noticed it's difficult for me to have an orgasm.  My boyfriend seems to be patient and understanding so that's a plus, but it is bothersome for me.  I would say the benefits are worth the side effects though.

I feel like a different person since I started taking this drug. I don't have panic attacks when I leave the house anymore, and my counting (OCD - I'm a numbers girl & used to count everything!) stopped within weeks of starting on this drug. 
   I've found that it's best to take it around noon, if you take it before bed you may not be able to sleep, and taken too early in the morning you may be sleepy all day. Noon works great for me! I sleep well at night, have energy in the morning and just don't feel run-down all day anymore.
   I have had some side effects, but I kinda love those too. I got Loss of Appetite and Dry Mouth, luckily enough. I have some serious weight to lose (about 90 pounds,) and now I have less of an appetite and drink about three times as much water as I used to. I lost 12 pounds the first month on this drug! So no complaints here.

3484$Depression$8/25/2008 10:26:50 AM$Reviewer: coloradogirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been on this drug for 4 years and have been satisfied overall. I do have some weight gain I cannot take off no matter what, and also my sexual desire is next to nothing which my husband dislikes. I take it at night because it does make me tired during the day and I often take a sleep aid to sleep through the night. Nothing  too major just a Tylenol PM but the sleeping is a factor since I have a 2 year-old. I'd look for something else but don't have time to bother with it at this point.
3486$Depression$8/24/2008 8:19:05 AM$Reviewer: shorthandedgoal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Depression runs in my family on both sides.  I never knew I was truly depressed until in my late 20's my mother told me that she no longer enjoyed our conversations because I was always such a ""downer"".  My mother and I are very close and I decided right then and there to do something about it.  Zoloft and Prozac did nothing.  Effexor made me extremely sick to my stomach.  Was on Paxil for quite a while until I met my husband and wanted him to know that my lack of sex drive was not related to him. Wellbutrin put me in such a fog I walked around like a zombie, could not control my extremities and felt like my head was floating above my body.  Along came Lexapro and I was saved!!  Something finally worked well with my body chemistry(an my mother's as well) and didn't cause me strange side effects!!  Being that my insurance did not cover it, my doctor put me on Celexa (Lexapro's cousin) and I have never looked back.  I do not ""hide out"" or avoid social situations as much as I used to.  I laugh and love to make people laugh.  People that I confide in about taking an antidepresant can not believe that I actually NEED this.  That is how much this has helped me.  Lastly, the only side effect I get is if I forget to take it for a few days I will cry at the drop of a hat.  I will feel like crying over ANYTHING when I skip a dose/doses.  It is then I know I am off my routine... but no other side effects.  Hope this helps someone else."
3487$Depression$8/22/2008 8:14:00 AM$Reviewer: $4$4$5$I have been on Celexa for about 5 years now. The only time I've ever had a problem was when I have missed doses or stopped taking it all-together. One or two missed doses doesn't affect me but any more than that and I notice a big difference in my mood. While on this medication my anger, weepiness, and aggression are all relieved. I recommend it to anyone experiencing these feelings, however, if you also suffer from depression it shouldn't be your only method of treatment. Also, as with any medication, you should take it exactly as prescribed and try not to miss a dose or just stop taking it without consulting your physician.

The peace and calm I had been seeking had finally been bestowed upon me.  For some quirky reason or another, I then decided to stop taking Celexa. NEVER, NEVER STOP TAKING THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT MEDICAL CONTROL!!!!!! After less than a week after I abruptly stopped taking this med, I tried killing myself.  I am now on different mental health care medications, and doing well ... scared the living daylights out of me!

It has worked so much better for me...no more racing thoughts, I rarely have anxiety attacks, and I don't get into such deep ""valleys"" anymore.  I didn't take it for a few days when I ran out of pills while on vacation...very bad thing.  I felt like I was going absolutely crazy.  But right away when I started up again everything was back to normal, even the first day I took it.  Every day isn't perfect, but it has allowed me to function in my daily life and I no longer feel completely stuck and unable to deal with problems, big or small.

Instantly, major weight gain occurred and would not come off.  Tired all the time; over time had to increase dosage and then decrease when I got too anxious.  If forgot to take it for a day, sickness (stomach upset, nervousness) would occur.  When I finally decided I did not need it anymore (with my doctor's knowledge); I gradually decreased the dosage.  BE AWARE: There is no going ""cold turkey"" with this medicine; you will become very physically sick if you do.  I gradually cut back 5-10 mg about every three-five months as I could; then at the lowest dose, went every other day until the medication was finished.  The highest I was at was 60 mg.  It took about 2 years to get off the medication.  It was very tough; there was stomach upset; worry; diarhea; cold sweats; felt like my head was ""foggy"".  But it can be done.  If you feel you need to get off this medicine; talk to your doctor and give yourself A LOT of time (gradually; at least a year).  I really think your body and mind become dependent on it.  If I could do it, anyone can.  Best of Luck; be blessed."

I don't sleep that great at night, but I do have two children under 4 years old and that may be the problem, but I truly believe in that first 3 weeks it was a miricle drug, now I am having second thoughts.  My anger, depression and short temper has improved greatly but I am just so tired all the time.  I can sleep 10 hours through the night and then get up for only about 4 hours then take a 3 hour nap.  That is just not exeptable for a mother of two.  I will continue on this med until my doctor has any other suggestions.

Maybe the fact that I am more active, taking long walks, eating healthy, has helped me skip all those side effects that everyone talks about.
If you start on this medication I recommend to ALL to adjust your lifestyle as well. Go outside! Enjoy the sun! Exercise..Help yourself, don't expect the medicine to do it all for you. You need to put something for yourself too!

3579$Depression$4/6/2008 12:25:53 PM$Reviewer: Rose, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I started taking Celexa in the AM because it has a tendency to keep me up at night. I have taken it for about 5 years after trying Paxil and Zoloft both of which had horrible side effects (paxil left me with dry heaves) and zoloft left me too spacey. I would recommend backing off on caffeine if you are taking Celexa in the AM because it gives you a boost and you may feel spacey if you have caffeine along with it. As with any drug, side effects seems worse at first but all of mine on Celexa went away after consistently taking it. I was nauseated at first but after my body got used to the AM routine it went away. Consistency with taking Celexa at the same time every day is what will help you notice a big differece. Like I said, PM doses keep me awake still, but it had no effect on weight, skin, sex drive, or ability to process thought (its actually helped me in all of those areas!)

I have been taking Celexa for about 3 months and at first I felt great aside from all of the usual side effects. Now I'm exhausted all the time although I don't have many outrageous mood swings anymore I still feel irritated and stressed. The exhaustion is what gets to me most. It is hard for me to wake up in the morning and get up to get ready for work. I have already quit one job because I didn't have the energy level for it.   I'm hoping things get better for me. This is the 4th medicine I've tried and I'm only 21 years old.

Worked well up until about six months ago when I started to become extremely depressed/suicidal. Doctor recommended Celexa. Have been on 40 mg per day for about six weeks now and have never felt better in my entire life! Only side effect is very vivid and strange dreams, but absolutely no other side effects. I highly urge anybody who is depressed in any way, shape, or form to use this drug, because it is an absolute life saver!

But I found myself not being able to get out of bed to go to work or do anything. I started taking citalopram and after a week I felt a little better but not ALOT better. My dr increased my dosage twice. I feel much better. I don't cry at the drop of a hat for no particular reason anymore. My thoughts seem more clear and not jumbled. My stressors are still there but this medication has helped me to handle them differently and not snap at people. That is the biggest difference that I've noticed. I like this however I don't want to stay on this for a long period of time. On my next dr visit I am going to discuss weaning off of this. If you are hesitant about trying this anti depressant, don't be. Talk with your dr

Lost control of emotions with love of my life. Started on 20mg. It has only been a week but can feel a powerful difference. No more alcohol cravings-Trust me-Do Not Drink while on this stuff. It's crazy. Cures anxiety. Depression lifts but ambition decreases. Strange sexual side affects. Definite decrease in sex drive, but get sudden unexpected sexual urges. Gives you peace, but you quit caring about people quite as much. I became introspective and clear headed. I think other people are hilarious now. They seem like a joke to me. Before I felt the joke was on me. Never believed in medication, but you can feel this stuff reorganize your brain.Does not alleviate heartbreak though. Wish I started it sooner.

Along with exercise, positive thinking and taking care of my spiritual self feel positive about my future. After reading some of the comments posted, I am comforted by the fact that my physican started me off slow and is not over medicating me. It seems that some people are thrown on 40mg and no one is really monitoring their condition. Depression is not suppose to last for years and it seems that some people need to deal with the life issues  that continue to contribute to their depression. To those who have been depressed for a long time, it might be time to get a second opinion or an alternative diagnois. God Bless and good health.

Unlike Prozac,  Celexa is not an approved medication for bulimia, so I'm seeking alternative help for my eating disorder. However, I credit Celexa with curbing my depression and anxiety. I'm very happy.

Tried prozac first-had sexual side effects. Have been taking 40 mg celexa 5 years. Those around me noticed a difference immediately without knowing I began taking medication.  Tried ""weaning"" myself off without telling my wife-to no avail, she knew within 3 days.  I am concerned about long term effects.  I wished I had made the decision to take this medicaiton sooner.  "

This led to depression, as I am a very social, and work oriented person. One small dose of this medication has helped me cope with the depression and I have been back to work for years now. I do continue to take the medication, as when I stop my thinking is fuzzy.

3704$Depression$12/13/2007 3:40:47 PM$Reviewer: Calm inside, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I had gotten depressed and suicidal because of family problems with my children.  It had gotten very bad with crying nonstop and even thinking about how to commit suicide.  I knew I needed help.  The celexa has been very helpful with the suicidal thoughts and the depression, the only things that bother me is I find it very hard to cry and like one of the other reviews I read, I feel numb.  I've only gained 2 pounds and this I believe is from the holiday eating as I've been on the med since September 2007 and just gained the weight in December. Sometimes I feel disconnected from things in life, but then I wonder if feeling normal finally instead of always crying and feeling suicidal and depressed is just taking some getting used to.  I really never had calmness like I do now on the celexa.  I've been on paxil and gained 50 pounds, on wellbutrin and lost weight but never on anything that has helped me this much. I hope I don't have to take this for the rest of my life, but if I do it's better than the life I was living.

I am currently taking a combination of dexadrine and celexa and am still noticing a steady increase in weight gain. The drug itself works well in masking depression symptoms, however I notice that I feel like I am in a constant fog and could care less about my surrounding environment. I often wonder if it is better to fight the depression naturally and maintain a healthy weight, or remain on this drug and continue to gain weight, feel like I am in a fog and not remember a darn thing from one day to the next. It seems like it is a catch 22.

3723$Depression$12/3/2007 8:13:10 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$It was hard for me to admit I had mild depression and even more difficult for me to begin taking medication for it. I always felt like I should be able to control how I feel. I never felt suicidal, just blah and negative, so I admitted I could feel better and gave in to taking the medication and went to 3 counseling sessions, mainly to accept my depression. It has been a very positive experience for me and the medication has been working. I take 40mg 1x/day and I feel more positive about my life and my interactions with people. I had mild side effects for the first month, dry mouth, yawning, decreased sexual desire, but they went away. I now believe depression is an inbalance of chemicals in the brain because after taking Celexa, my thinking changed. I tried to change it on my own to be more positive, but it always felt like something was blocking me. I have now realized and accepted I have mild depression, and that is what was blocking me and I don't have the power to control it, and it's ok to get help with it.

My energy level is up. My crying spells for no reason stopped. I am happier and I don't have as much stress.  I suffered from depression for years not knowing what it was and had a suicide attempt back in 1996.  I am aware of it's symptoms now and can usually get myself back on track without medications.  This time was different.  The gym didn't help, talking to people didn't help.  I am so glad that I had the courage to call my doctor and say I need help.  I hope I don't need to be on medication for ever, but I am a much better wife and mother on it right now.

I started at 10mg, then uped to 20mg which is what my dr recommended me at. I have had severe depression since before I hit puberty and am now 24, almost 25 (I hit puberty at around 9-10). I suffered through my entire per-adult life and well into the beginning of it. I finally took control iPad started this medication. Talking therapy didn't work. Everything I tried didn't work. Finally, after about 6-8 months on this medication (yes really) I feel fantastic. I've never been happier. I don't remember feeling this great. Its like I actually see colors again. I'm trying to stop this medication now, since I think I can finally deal without it (it's been Bout a year) and I'm having a bit of a difficult time with it though. I'm still feeling good but I get crazy moody bouts of ANGER. I have really no reason to be angry but everything is just enraging!! It's very frustrating. I hope it goes away soon but I would recommend quitting the meds as SLOWLY as possible to fight the mood swings. I had no real side affects on this medication except for craving for sweets and a harder time to orgasm (but when I did it was awesome lol).

I wasn't myself.  I was just an emotionless zombie going through the motions.  With my depression my mood varies, on a scale -10 to 10 (10 being best), -10 to 3 and with the citalopram I just stayed around a -4.  It made me feel wrong and overall made my mood steady but negative.

Suffered from depression for the last 10 years or so. Tried a few different medications, but nothing seemed to work as well. I have mild side effects such as increased thirst and urination (could also be due to stomach disease), slight decrease in sex drive, but no issues with climax. I went from trying to overdose, to being the happiest I have ever been in my life. Recently tried to get off of it, but the symptoms were absolutely terrible. Brain zaps happen even if I miss one dosage. I used to have a horrible time sleeping, and would only get about 3 hours a night, now I get around 12. Periods of extreme exhaustion throughout the day, but as long as I stay active, I'm fine. This drug does not work for everyone, but has changed my life completely.

But a few months in (this is gonna sound odd) I had abnormal vaginal bleeding. I bled vaginally for literally 3 months straight. I consulted my doctor that gave me this medicine and he took me off it and put me on something different.

I felt so good on Celexa that I continued to use it for 11 years.  I use it through two pregnancies.  Now, I have been off of it for about 45 days.  While on Celexa, I felt fine and things did not bother me much.  My babies, when born, did not cry.  They were the calmest children while breastfed.  Now I wonder what have I done.  I am physical sick every day.  I can not do simple tasks like go grocery shopping or listen to an automated recording on the phone. The migraines are intense and nausea excruciating, irritating, and my overall feeling miserable.  Do Not Take This Drug!  If you are on it, it is time to talk to your doctor about something different.  Take my advice, the shorter the half life of the drug, the better.

After increasing dosage a few times when it started fading in effects, I'm now on 30mg and will probably move up again in a few months. It's helped me have a good outlook and not be so depressed, but therapy is also necessary for most people with underlying issues. There were some side effects like dry mouth and feeling numb inside for a little while but I'm satisfied now.

At first it took away my anxiety and then made me sleepy a lot. After 6 or so weeks i wasn't sleepy all the time, the anxiety was gone and my depression diminished significantly. It seems to put a floor on how low I get. I love this medication for giving me another chance. I wish I had taken it a long time ago.

It has helped me tremendously! I was diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder, Dysthymia, and General Anxiety disorder.

1691$Major Depressive Disorder$10/10/2014 11:51:36 AM$Reviewer: Sstyle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I have suffered with depression and anxiety since I was 13 and I am now 49. Been in therapy through the years and tried many different medications. I have been taking 20mg Celexa for about 5 months now and I feel better than I can ever remember feeling. I did have constant yawning for the first month, and still do periodically. I take it at night and sleep better than I have in years. Yay for that! I have noticed that I don't feel deeply on this medication (like watching a sad movie where I would normally cry, I don't). It definitely takes the edge off and keeps my mood at a manageable level so I can deal with the difficulties life throws at me. Another thing I would suggest is something called Mindfullness Training. I am also doing that through the Veterans Administration and it is extremely helpful with interpersonal communications with family, friends, kids, and work relationships.

It makes you extremely hungry, but despite watching and eating healthy, it refuses to come off. And this was after I had lost 40 pounds on my own! 

Despite the increased appetite, I should mention that I have no libido with this as well. Nothing, I can't even get in the mood and when I manage to, it physically hurts. 

I also feel like a walking zombie, as I'm just ""here"" and that's it. I feel constantly tired and despite 30MG of adderall, it's still there. I don't feel like myself, even though the depression is better, but at the same time, it feels like I don't care and it's not worth it.

I can't even muster the energy to get angry, and I'm constantly tired or yawning.

I have already tried Wellbutrin and it made me all over the place with my moods. Doctor ended up switching me to Celexa, which hasn't been good for me either. Doctor sent me home with a trial of Viibryd and to see how that does after I wean myself off of Celexa. I am hoping for better results for sure."
1805$Major Depressive Disorder$9/23/2013 3:09:08 PM$Reviewer: Bobby64, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$This is one of the first antidepressants I ever took.  It didn’t treat me well at all.  It made me dizzy, woozy, and sick to my stomach.  In fact, just hearing one of my parents mention the pill made me feel nauseated.  I stopped it in just a week.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

One of two Medications, the (Celexa and Xanax) that I have been on from 2004 for Aid in this. 

**(I won't speak any more about the Xanax)

The first 5-6 Years were just great upon this Medication in many ways. I felt like THIS Script was the first out of the many, MANY different SSRI's & such that I've been Prescribed was actually going to help Myself  out lots. Well, as I said..it did. But then came sometime in 2010. For whatever reason, (Notice, also about 4 Years in, My 40mg dose got knocked up to a daily 60mg dose) it just stopped having an effect on Me at all...You know, whatsoever. As I said, THAT was back in 2010, (Early 2010, maybe) when it lost its Potency, and I have STILL been taking it. Scared of the awful SSRI Discontinuation withdrawals that could possibly manifest You know...I've been taking it now basically 7 Years. But as I said, the other Medication that I have mentioned in this post, 100% definitely helps out, so I don't see the problem in continuing to take it, as other than the fact I feel its lost a lot of it's potency, there are also not a single Extrapyramidal symptom tht I get from it. So I'm Thankful for that. I WOULD recommend Celexa to first time SSRI users as I said, it worked great for Myself for many Years, and I never had Sexual Impotence, or any usual effects the the SS Reuptake Inhibitors are known to cause. I, Myself would say this is THE best SSRI, and I've taken at least 12 of them. "

1892$Major Depressive Disorder$3/7/2013 5:05:24 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$I was prescribed Celexa 20mg daily after inpatient treatment for clinical depression & suicidal ideation. Prior to hospitalization, I was taking Wellbutrin 150mg twice daily. The Celexa has helped immensely with my mood, and it took me only 4 days to start noticing a major difference in how I feel about myself. I am calm, and I feel like I finally have some control over my emotions. I no longer experience random crying episodes & I have a LOT more patience with with family. I used to not even get out of bed. I also seem to handle stressful situations with less anxiety. I have been able to enjoy a few of my old hobbies again. For the first time in over a year, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. The only side effect I'm experiencing IS LITTLE TO NO INTREST IN SEX. I also have an EXTREMELY hard time achieving orgasm now, and if I am lucky enough to have one, the intensity level is about 2/10, where as before I starting taking this medication, I had a very high sex drive, and no trouble having multiple orgasms with an intensity level of 8-9/10. I am a 37 year old female, in a stable and supportive relationship with a man, and this has been a MAJOR issue with me, since we used to enjoy sex at least twice a day. I know it seems silly to regard sex as being so important. I have a wonderful emotional connection with my partner, but now I am unable to connect with him physically. I plan to talk with my therapist about a possible med change if there is no way to fix the current situation. Other than this one single complaint,(which many people probably wouldn't object to) THIS MEDICATION HAS TRULY WORKED WONDERS, AND I FEEL HOPEFUL ABOUT LIFE AGAIN!!!
