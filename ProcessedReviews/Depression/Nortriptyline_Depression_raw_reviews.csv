25$Depression$11/2/2011 9:30:43 PM$Reviewer: professor, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$Have been on the drug for over 25 years now. Had to go through a whole host of other depression Rx's before finding this one to be effective.  There are side effects: dry mouth; ringing in the ears; weight gain--which has to be attended to; but it is the only Rx that has worked for me.  So the trade off in terms of putting up with the side effects has been worth it. I use Biotene mouthwask to handle the dry mouth--it's effective. I have to watch my diet but my determination does me well.  
31$Depression$6/10/2011 11:51:17 PM$Reviewer: bilingual, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$2$2$I have being taking this medication for eight months now. Each pill is 10mg cap. At first I took one pill, then my MD asked me to take 2 pills. One pill mostly stopped all the crying and sadness I had, but was not able to fall asleep fast enough. Then, my MD asked me to take 2 pills, I did not do well since I really was not able to sleep at all. Now, my migraine,neck pain and crying are starting again. My MD asked me to take 2 pills again and add Tylenol pM for night time. I am not really sure whats going on. My migraines are active twice a month for at least 4 to 5 days each. For the migraines I use Relpax, but I need this medication constantly within my reach. Overall, I do not feel that Pamelor will help me entirely. 
33$Depression$5/30/2011 10:39:34 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$3$This medication took a couple of weeks to start working. After about 2 weeks I could tell a difference in myself. I was happier and felt less anxious. My family noticed a difference in me too (I wasn't soo gloomy and grouchy anymore.) For the most part I would say Pamelor has helped me. My only issue is that I sometimes forget to take it. I take it once daily at bedtime. If I'm really tired when going to bed, I sometimes forget to take it. I end up missing that dose because I don't want to take it the next morning (because I'm concerned that it might be too close to the next dose.) When I miss 1 or 2 doses, I end up feeling depressed, angry, and anxious all over again. This has just happened to me, so today I set an alarm in my phone to remind me to take it every night. All-in-All, As long as I keep up with it, It gives me great results!

Pamelor- ask your doc for Imipramine! It's the best.It has few of the side effects of the others.I've been on many TCA's, and 
Imipramine leaves Nortriptyline and the others
(like elavil)in the shade! You will not wake
up groggy,it does not cause palpitations,you
will not be dizzy,etc.This is the stuff! It also causes more mood elevation than the others.I wake up every morning downright
euphoric(happy,content)! It works for the same
things pamelor and elevil are used for(except
not the best for sleep-only causes mild drowsiness)Try it.you wont go back.Small
doses are very effective.Difficulty urinating
goes away after awhile.Makes skin pleasantly
tingle-becomes less with time."

I've had RA for 19 years, depression for 19 years, menopause going on 5 years and fatigue since I can't remember when.  I have been on every medication possible for above issues.  After reading these reviews, I thought I would give Pamelor another try.  I only took it for about a week and got so frustrated because I did not experience any positive results. Actually, NO RESULTS at all. I guess that is the ""mania/anger feelings"" that come along with depression.  Thanks to all of you who took time out to write a review whether positive or negative.  It made me feel I need to give Pamelor time to adjust to my body.  Since, the doctor has prescribed adderall which has relieved only the fatigue issues.  Wish I could find something that would help with at least one more of my ailments.  If anyone has any ideas, please please please advise.  I am so ready to enjoy life since the above has robbed my entire 30's and most of my 40's.  (I will be 48 in June).  [email protected]   I would certainly appreciate any and all comments.  "

Had a dry mouth, which was relieved by having sugar free gum or candy.. Never gained an once of weight. In fact I lost weight on this medication as my depression lifted ( I'm a stress eater).

I began using this med after trying several others including Prozac.  This was the only med that helped.  At 17 I was weened off because of how well I was doing.  Fast forward to 31, after discussing with my doctor we decided to use this drug again,  I feel much better all together.  I am sleeping better and can handle life calmer.

The only good side effect: weight loss. I take a very low dosage (25 mg) and this has not helped at all with my depression. I feel just as miserable as when I started taking it. I am going to my psychiatrist tomorrow and request to be taken off of it.
86$Depression$12/30/2008 1:27:47 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$1$I was prescibed Pamelor 20 years ago for depression.  Taking the drug was very difficult-- it took a good two weeks for my body to adjust to the medicine.  I remember falling over in class because I was so tired-- I couldn't keep my eyes open during the adjustment period.  Also, it caused SEVERE constipation for me.  Overall, the drug worked so-so for depression.  I was very happy when newer depression class drugs became available. In fact, I am surprised that they still prescribe this-- it is so old school.

At first I felt I was feeling worse. For the first few weeks I was crying everyday so my psychiatrist added Lithium to help stabilize my mood. Honestly I don't feel like it does anything. With the lithium (3 weeks now) I'm not crying as much, still very emotional but able to hold it in better. Ive tried numerous medications and either feel worse or don't feel any different at all...like I may as well not even be taking anything. I always seem to have no problem gaining weight though. Fortunately I haven't experienced many of the common side effects associated with this medication. I have Dysthymia/Double Depression and bouts of anxiety. I am really losing hope that there is anything more to...this, or if this is how life will always be.

211$Depression$11/21/2013 4:30:44 PM$Reviewer: cb, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I've suffered from depression since adolescence. 10 years of therapy have helped me cope but have tried multiple SSRIs, SNRIs, and Welbutrin throughout the years without any of them working well longterm. I've been on nortriptypine for over 5 years now and it is the best anti-depressant I've ever tried by far. I actually sleep for the first time in my life without waking up with panic attacks. Getting a good night's sleep alone has probably done wonders for my depression and anxiety. Sometimes I do feel a bit more tired when I do wake up but it's worth the good sleep. I do have some annoying side effects like increased heart rate, dry mouth, and flushing/red skin but they are worth the results I get. I haven't had a manic episode in years and am able to control and re-direct negative emotions much more effectively than I ever have. I really thank the one psychiatrist that suggest this medication to me, it changed my life.

I have run the gammet of drugs over the years to no avail.  However, I was able to control my moods until a divorce.  
At the age of 29 I had my first majoy episode,, and was treated with drugs and therapy for a short period.  A new wife helped greatly for a while.  I used alcohol to treat myself for many years, but graduated from AA and the depression came back
Due to a turn coat friend, I had my third episode sober, smoking free, and off drugs.  I for the first time could not take life as it was and took an overdose of Xanax.  Luckyly it was discovered immediatedly and I was cleaned out and sent to lock up for 7 days observation.  I came out taking 300mg of Wellbutrin for 3 years and 1 year of therapy.  However, the occassional thought of suicide  still occured.  My doctor put me on 50mg of Nortriptyline at night along with Clomapin for anxiety and 300 mg of Wellbutrin during the day.  I now sleep through the night and am a little weak in the mornings with a dry mouth, but it get better as the day goes by.  I solved the constipation by taking 3-4 magnesiom tables daily.  My suicidal thought are under control as I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't have that many days left on earth and I want to finally enjoy them.  A little dry mouth or constipation I can handle, suicide I cannot handle.  It is a premanent solution for a temperary problem.  "

429$Depression$8/8/2009 12:37:51 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$3$I was on this 20 years. It did help me function b/c I had depression and anxiety and insomnia. I was able to go to college and get a job but after many years on it I developed problems.  I now have gastroparesis and IBS. Most DR.s say this med helps the stomach but slows the intestines but since I've been off it 5 months all of my problesm with digestion  from swallowing all the way down to eliminating have improved. I had also developed reoccurring infections in my lymph nodes and exhaustion to the point of sleeping 17 hours a day. This too has improved but not gone away since being off the med. I'm guessing that my body has changed as I have aged making this not the right medicine for me anymore but it helped for many years. When I first started it it was a relief to me not to wake in the middle of the night in full blown panic attacks, and to feel calmer. No other med has worked as well but I have to say goodbye b/c the infections in my lymph nodes and the exhaustion is too much to deal with. Some people say they felt foggy on it but I never did. I felt electrified without it, and normal with it. It calmed me, and in emergencies, it really stopped full blown panic attacks. Dr.s say I shouldn't take it as it is dangerous but what antidepressant isn't? Am considering Lexapro now, but after being drug free for 5 months I feel physically healthier and am wondering if the trade off is worth it. I am depressed. I have no....no desire to do anything. No drive. No hope. No pill is magic but what if it helps? No way to know but to try. As long as it isn't liver/heart/kidney/nervous system damaging I guess comming off would stop the negative effects. Plus I'm waiting to completely come back from the Cymbalta which nearly killed me.
436$Depression$7/18/2009 9:18:35 PM$Reviewer: ddprib, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$The primary reason of me taking this is for sleep deprivation with a secondary reason for depression.  Prior to this medication, I was taking (3) 50mg tablets of amitriptyline at dinner as they take quite awhile to take effect. Amitriptyline definately works better than the Nortriptyline for sleep if taken at dinner time and not bedtime. I take Zanax 3 times a day also, so I don't know if they cause anxiety.  I had to get off of the Amitriptyline because it makes it very difficult to get up at an early time like going to work.  The Amitriptyline started making me listless and depressed during the day also and then my Dr. put me on Nortriptyline as it makes it easier on getting up in the morning and having more energy during the day.  I would advise anybody taking Nortriptyline or Amitriptyline to read all the precautions here on WebMD as it gave me alot of information of all of the side effects along with other health problems you may have as Diabeties, etc.that is listed and let your Dr. know about many other body issues you may have including Diabeties, etc. I am more well of on Nortriptyline than Amitriptyline, unless you just want to sleep night and day.  In closing, I just urge you to read all of the information they provide here on WebMD. About 90% of the info. provided between the 2 medicines is the same.

The first few days I was using it I felt very tired in the afternoon, But after about a week it really started to help lessen the symtoms of my condition. Less anxiety, no aches or pain, better consentraction/focus, more energy, happier, less irratable, more ease falling asleep, and I was do much better in school. When ever I exercise or reading I felt a pleasant tingling sensation, a side effect but an enjoyable one. Exercising also increased the benefits of the medication. The side effects usually were not to bad, dry mouth and strange taste in the morning, dizziness after standing up, faster heartbeat, and slightly high blood pressure. I never had any sexual problems, but I have noticed a lowered sex drive. About 1 to 2 times a month at night after taking my dose I start to have what I would describe as ""closed-eye visuals"", very strange and sometimes scary, I also sometimes wake in the night and when I started to fall back asleep after a brief amount of time I would feel an unpleasant strong ""prickly"" felling in my brain, followed by the strange dreams, which seemed overpowering as if I was still awake. Overall for me the benefits outweighted the side effects."

She was on it for a little over a year. She committed suicide while on this medication...ironically...this medication is what she used for the suicide...she took an intentional overdose. I suppose that everyone is different and responds different to medication but I have read some other's comments about extreme mood changes in their loved ones. Then there are other reports stating everything is working great. I have always found it strange that the very medications they use to treat depression can actually make it worse. Most antidepressants now actually have warnings about causing a deeper level of depression and actually causing thoughts of suicide in some people...even in those who have never considered suicide previously. Doesn't make sense to me...but I am not a doctor nor a chemist who make these drugs. Hooray to those of you that find relief in this medicine and I have deep sympathies for those who have seen themselves or their loved ones go further downhill. It is rough to witness someone's pain and suffering like that.

Have taken SSRIs, and an MAOI with little success. This medication has increased my fatigue, so that I'm sleeping 12+ hrs a day, and still feel tired. Instead of solely decreasing the depression, the med seems to numb all of my emotional responses.  I am less tearful but more apathetic. Also I've noticed increased irritability. 

I have had ongoing headaches seemingly related to the depression and tension, and haven't noticed any difference in the severity or frequency of those headaches since taking the medication. 

I've had extremely dry mouth and increased thirst since starting the medication, along with increased appetite.  I've only been on the medication a short period of time (two weeks), but I think that my doctor will probably take me off the medication when I go back for my next appointment. "
