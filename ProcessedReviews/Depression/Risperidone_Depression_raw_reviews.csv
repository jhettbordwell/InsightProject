Risperidone in combination with Lexapro helped me dramatically and gave me hope. Yes, I've gained weight, but I'm developing a strategy for controlling my appetite.

But, after reading all the info about it, I am very concerned of the side effects.  I read the reviews from others and it looks like a lot of patients are really unhappy with this medication.  It states severe weight gain.  Does it just automatically make you gain weight or can you control the weight you gain, ie: diet, exercise, etc.?  I dont want to have a heatstroke or diabetes either.  I need something to help my bipolar moods, that are mostly depressed no mania.  I just don't want to have a new illness develop from a medication that I'm taking for my mental well being.  Does anyone have any positive info to give me.

My doctor did a TERRIBLE job alerting me of side affects. It is very detrimental to a person who is already depressed to gain than much weight and be told that you are just not living a healthy lifestyle. It did not calm my anxiety. I was tired all the time, had hot flashes. I was never told the dangers of using this drug long term.

The positive effects were apparent the day after I began taking it. It has greatly minimized any self-destructive inclinations. In short, I think it saved my life.

I have noticed it has helped with other things besides the depression and they are my Tinnitis(ringing in the ears)which I suffered from for ten years and the OCD that went along with the ringing. These disorders disappeared about a week into the risperidole and remain among the missing to this day. I call it my miracle drug. I started out on .05mg and within 3 months time I was taking 2 and a half mgs and would suggest it to anyone that suffers from any depression like disorders.

259$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/15/2017 6:47:57 AM$Reviewer: Gastroparesis Girl, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I use this as both an additional medication to treat depression and also as an additional medication for obsessive compulsive disorder. It works very well for both. I'm on 3 mg and take it at night before bedtime. It helps my mind not race while I'm trying to get to sleep so I can actually sleep now without my mind worrying about a million things that I can't control. I still have anxiety; I'm just wired that way, but it definitely cuts way back on it. It's definitely helped me. I've never had the weight gain from this drug some people talk about. Knock on wood.

Currently on Effexor SR with some relief.  My doctor added Risperdal to help.  I felt absolutely WONDERFUL...I felt like my old self emotionally.  My husband even noticed the change because I had more energy, bounce in my step. It also lessened my anxiety. Unfortunately, I developed breast milk within 2 days of starting the medication, my breast doubled in size, was constantly hungry (gained five lbs within a week), and developed very embarrassing drooling.  I went off the medication and the side effects stopped.  But I'm back to how I was before I started taking this.  I truly wish I could have tolerated the side effects.

383$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/1/2011 4:54:52 PM$Reviewer: Barbara J, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I was prescribed this med when I was in a pych. hospital for depression.  I am bipolar.  I questioned the doctor as I don't respond well to many drugs.  (I take Cymbalta and Lamictal with no horrible problems).  He assured me they didn't see side effects with this med unless someone was taking 9ms or more.  I took .50mgs for only 2 days and woke up with a charley horse in my left leg that wouldn't go away. My tongue, head, neck, arms and legs were moving involuntarily. I had had two inch long blood filled places on my legs, similar, but smaller sores in my mouth. I couldn't be understood when I spoke and had a rapid heart rate.  I ended up in the ER.  They gave me something to calm my muscles down and told me I should be back to normal withing 24-48 hours.  I saw my own Psychiatrist the following day; he told me it would be longer as my pupils were still huge.  19 days I suffered with those side effects before they wore off.  My doctor was ticked that it was even prescribed for me, as it is an older drug, not used as much for bipolars because there are others that work better with fewer side effects.  I now have it listed as a drug I am allergic to.  I wouldn't recommend anyone take this without trying everything else first!

A few months after this drug was added, I began experiencing vision problems, and, after seeing my eye doctor, was referred to a neurologist ophthalmologist who diagnosed me with Nystagmus in both my eyes, which is a ticking of the eye, much like a pendulum on a clock.  With the help of the drug, Lamictal, the nystagmus is controlled in my front and right vision, but not when I look to my left.  This problem occurred over a year ago, and it appears to be permanent.  This is a horrible drug -- I would not recommend anyone taking it.

I sleep well, dream alot, i was groggy for 2 weeks until my body adjusted to it. I have noticed a decrease in anxiety, paranoia, rapid thoughts. I am less suspicous and have more patience and focus. Cons were that it made me extremely thirsty and increased my appetite. I dealt with these side effects by using chapstick, drinking bottled water and controlled my weight by choosing to eat veggies when hunrgy instead of a cheeseburger. I still felt depressed on this medication, so i was put on wellbutrin SR twice a day for that problem.

This medicine was crap. If I missed one dose I could not sleep. I was irritable if I did not take it. I gained about thirty pounds while on it. When I dropped it cold turkey I lost thirty pounds within three to four months. After a two week detox period I could sleep normally and was not irritable. It's been a year and a half since I last took and haven't looked back. I used along with risperdal the generic prozac: fluoxetine. I feel my depression is in check and I have a pretty good handle on it without the risperdal.

I wound up in the hospital because it caused me to get dependent edema in both my feet and I could not breath. I had very short breaths and could not breath properly. I have a feeling that my throat was closing and was causing me to not get enough in my airway. I was in the hospital for 24 hours and they took every test in the book and I am very happy to say that they found nothing wrong with me. They didn't believe me at first that it was the deadly side effects from this drug. I had cut the dosage in half and stopped taking it while I was in there.

It helped to calm him down. However had to stop the anti-depressant after 3 months as the combination was making him hyper - he was on 3mg of Risperdal. 
After 4 months on risperdal, he started experiencing severe back pain with nausea and vomiting. Doctors did all sorts of tests on him to find the cause of the problem but none believed that Risperdal was causing the problem. I finally took him off it and the symptoms disappeared. However, after a week his aggressiveness returned. I put him back on risperdal but at a lower dose of 1.5 mg. His back pain and nausea returned. He is now on Abilify which so far seems to suit him better.

540$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$5/14/2009 8:59:45 AM$Reviewer: emmalea, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for years only to live within denial of it believing I was misdiagnosed and only had depressive episodes. I did not have those happy highs, instead I had bouts of anger I could not control. One day I was screaming  at my 16 year old nephew, who never experienced this side of me, and I saw his eyes get big as he asked me why I was acting this way. I decided it was time to get help. A psychiatrist put me on wellbutrin for depression and 1 mg risperdal for anger. I read it was for schizophrenia and bulked at taking it because I know I do not suffer from it. My doctor confirmed I was not but asked me to trust his decision. I'm glad I did and wish I had taken this medication a long time ago. Initially there was some side effects of anxiety but was told to take benydryl to counteract it, which it did. It only lasted the first few days. My outlook is much different, my abnormal anger has subsided. I still get mad but its a normal emotion in response to normal situtations. I sleep through the night, I feel rested and not overly tired anymore, in fact I have more energy. I feel at peace and my family no longer has to walk on tiptoes around me. That is what I am most grateful for because as miserable as I felt, my family suffered more. I have had no wieght gain other than my normal fluctuations, I am geneticly large to begin. This medication has given me a new life.

I became insatiably hungry and gained about 40 pounds. If you try this for the same reason I did then I recommend you find something else as soon as you feel unusually hungry...I take Trileptal now instead of this.If you're like me, your hunger will never diminish 'till weeks and weeks after you quit taking it.

I also noticed one side effect my mouth watered alot one day...this medicine controlled my suicidal thoughts but I got on Trileptal and lost weight...I like Trileptal better...

567$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$1/9/2009 10:47:18 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$1$5$"Well, it worked. It helped organize my thoughts, made me feel ""less undone."" It also cause me to *lactate.* That's right. I was told it was a rare side effect. However, upon reviewing these other reviews, I found another instance in less than 5 minutes, so I doubt that it's rare. This is a classic case of the cure being worse than the disease. I'm absolutely disgusted by the lack of proper information and the general lax response I received from the doctor who prescribed it. Something seriously disturbing is going on in the body for drug to make a non-pregnant woman to lactate. The only upside is that it has made me swear off psych medication. I am not a guinea pig. Further investigation should be done on this drug, esp. in light of kick-backs and extreme side-effects.  "

It's been a real life saver with the only real side effect being lack of concentration. I wouldn't recommend getting on it though, unless you cannot function at all, as you may very well be on it for the rest of your life.

Risperdal is a social sedative...it keeps one from thinking or feeling ANYTHING, including joy. It should be banned from the market.

607$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$7/24/2008 8:47:47 AM$Reviewer: Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My psycho-pharmacologist decided to try having me take small (1.5 mg./day) doses of Risperdal as a mood stabilizer,in addition to my anitdepressant and antianxiety medications. I was concerned at first about taking an antipsychotic, but she reassured me that the pharmacist would know from the small dose that I was not being treated for psychosis. The drug has worked like a charm. I feel calmer, function better, and sleep much better, without any side effects that I've noticed. I feel so fortunate to have found a psychiatrist who specializes in pharmacology who keeps up with the latest uses of different medications and is able to try different medicines for different uses.

It scared me to death. My doctor put me on risperdal initially with my anti depressant, but i was still very agitated and racy so she finally just had me take the risperdal alone.  I immediately felt normal again!  I can concentrate, I sleep through the night, I eat normally, and I don't talk up a storm anymore.  The only thing that bothers me is the lack of sex drive that i have now.  Oh, and the bizzaro lactation.  I'm already weaning off of it, which always makes me nervous, but it has been a huge help in getting my mind back in my control.

The best sleep I've had in years. I did not notice improvement as a mood stabilizer. I would still be taking this, but I haven't had a period in six months and even started producing breast milk!

I finally lost weight after 2 pregnancies and then chunked out when starting treatment.  I've choked on gum 3 times in just 3 weeks and it makes me very dizzy and groggy.  Not cool since I operate heavy machinery at work.  I'm not going to continue using this med.  No improvements in mood - I""m still depressed as hell - but who wouldn't be after losing their children?  I hate this stuff.  I want off."

711$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$8/10/2010 12:41:02 AM$Reviewer: Melody, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$5$I've been receiving treatment for panic attacks and anxiety for a long time. Zoloft and Xanax work very well for me. But there are times when I get so frustrated and feel agitated that even I know there's no reason for feeling like that.  My doctor included Risperdal M-Tab 0.5 to be taken ONLY when I get very frustrated.  They worked very well even though I rarely ever take one.  I'm 56 years old and the possible side effect of sudden death or stroke from use of these tabs creeps me out.  Otherwise, I think it's very helpful.
