1$Depression$8/26/2015 12:09:49 AM$Reviewer: Wookers, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$1$3$I was given desipramine to try to reduce acute depression. Only after 2 weeks did I start to improve. HOWEVER, I can NOT recommend this med  -- when I tried to reduce the dosage, I experienced severe migraine headaches which totally wiped me out. When I restarted it, the headaches/flu-like symptoms disappeared. Avoid this drug unless you're prepared to feel physically ill. I switched to Prozac, which was quite good.I'm surprised these old drugs are still available.

4$Depression$5/1/2013 6:48:03 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$4$I stopped taking 10mg of Norpramine in the fall as my depression was better.  I recently was prescribed it again.  I had tingly sensations in my finger tips and my severe constipation returned.  The constipation was so bad it woke me up at night and kept me awake.  I stopped taking it, but still take two other meds for my depression and anxiety.

Works well. About twice a year for some reason I go through a week to ten days of mild depression, but over all it works for me. Tried the generic to save money, not as effective. Tried a newer drug some years back on new doctor's recommendation with bad experience, went back to norpramin. Old rule, ""If it works, stay with it."""

The down side is I sweat buckets all day. I have few choices in meds so I have to deal with the constant sweating and it is terrible.

But, I have been very constipated while being on this medicine. Im gona have to talk to the doctor about the constipation problem and hopefully it will go away as I take this longer.
14$Depression$7/8/2010 7:47:35 PM$Reviewer: jmanders2008, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$My doctor started me first on desipramine (generic version of Norpramin) without success. However when he started me on Norpramin (brand version), I started seeing the first signs of improvement in almost two years. I have been taking the drug now for about twelve years, and will be on it as a measure of prevention for the rest of my life.

21$Depression$3/20/2008 10:20:25 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more$5$5$5$Awesome Antidepressant with minimal side effects (dry mouth) so I chew alot of gum. I am a healthy 35 year old Male and have used since age 20. Would highly highly recommend this medication for depression. Not addictive or anything of that nature but I find it works for me so will probably take for life.

After 10 years of use I find it helps with mental alertness and less fatigue. 
26$Depression$5/18/2017 6:20:41 PM$Reviewer: Lucky Larry, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$4$I have been taking desipramine (the generic from Actavis) for depression since 2003, returning to it after trying other meds.  It is the only one that helped, although high doses caused shortness of breath, low-back pain, nightmares, stress, and anxiety.  The key has been finding the correct dose.  An important discovery was that chocolate produces a synergistic effect.  Taking it in the evening right after a large serving of dark chocolate and 10 ounces of milk allows me to keep the dose and prescription costs low.  It is not nearly as effective without chocolate during the day.  But a problem is that it is addictive.  Increasing the dose made me more depressed but going down improved my mood, so finding the optimal one has been difficult.

34$Depression$1/8/2014 10:55:25 PM$Reviewer: Beth, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$After trying almost every SSRI and 2 SNRIs this is the most effective and least side effects for me contrary to common reports.  My only complaint is if I forget to take it I get super high energy (manic?) the next morning and vomit shortly after lunch.   But as long as I take it regularly every night it helps me a lot. 
35$Depression$1/6/2014 8:21:54 AM$Reviewer: Kitty, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$This medication was given to me by my physician, Dr.  Richard Ackerman to relieve some symptoms of depression and it has returned me to 'the joy of living'.
36$Depression$9/23/2013 3:39:45 PM$Reviewer: Bobby64, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$5$My psychiatrist gave this to me for my depression.  I still felt lethargic and unmotivated while taking it.  Although it made me feel “non-depressed,” I didn’t feel happy, either.  I still had trouble enjoying many of my usual activities, save for in a few short bursts.  Going on too high of a dose made me feel drugged, anxious, grouchy, and... well, depressed.  Although I played around with the time of day I took the lower dose, I still felt more like a tired zombie than a happy person, even if I didn’t have any emotional breakdowns.  Also, my weight went up sixteen pounds in the three months I took it.  Plus, it seemed to mess with my ability to form new memories.  Although it helped a little, it certainly wasn’t the medicine that would save me.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.
42$Depression$11/4/2012 4:53:06 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$5$"Used it for depression with no real help. See from WebMD that it's also good for panic disorder -- guess I should check into its uses for that since I've had ""anxiety disorder"" for ages and no one has ever mention this drug for that condition."
43$Depression$9/7/2012 6:23:56 PM$Reviewer: Happy ever after!, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking this medication for 21 years and it has saved my live, the relationships with my children and my husband. I'm now 58 years old and take 150mg per day. Growing up I was depressed all the time and regular drugs doctors prescribed left me doped up and sluggish all the time. To be successful with this drug, you can't stop it when you start feeling better but continue the plan your doctor places you on. By the way, regular MDs did not know about this drug so it is very important to see a psychiatrist and visit him/her once a year for maintenance.
44$Depression$8/31/2012 3:16:57 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$Started with 25mg/day for 5 days and increased to 50mg/day.  On day three of 50mg and feeling dizzy, tingling in forearm,and headaches.  Overall feeling of discomfort.
45$Depression$7/15/2012 8:58:46 PM$Reviewer: Keiyentai, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$Started about 2 months ago on 100mg a day 50mg morning and 50mg night. At first it seemed to help then BAM almost all the negitave side effects this med has hit me like a train wreck. So I decided to stop...with out tappering down cause I was unable to get a hold of my Dr and the side effects were making things worse for my personal life. 3 days go by I think I am fine and suddenly just feel ill as all hell and throw up. Next day (today) I woke up around noon after my gf told me she was going to work around 11:30. Got to my computer and just felt ill like if I had the flu or something but I knew it was from the Desipramine so after not being able to take it I took 50mg and with in an hour or so I am now feeling better. I am going to stay at 50mg and try to get a hold of my Dr tomorrow and see if I can taper from 50mg to nothing or if I would need to go from 50mg to 25mg to nothing over a week or so. I can honestly say I hate this med with a passion. I would rather be depressed sometimes then have painful urination/ejaculation and urine retention and constantly feeling like a zombie all day. I stopped SSRI's cause they killed my sex drive, this crap just makes it painful and not in a good way. I would HONESTLY USE THIS AS LAST RESORT. That's just my thoughts.

I'm depreesed, tired all the time.  When I do finally wake up I'm groggy, and forgetful for at least 2 hours.  Gonna call doc tomorrow.

This drug literally saved my life! Went from being a poor employee to a successful person in all aspects of my life. Couldn't concentrate on anything for more than a day or two and wondered why I didn't have the energy to get out of bed.
56$Depression$1/19/2010 4:29:00 PM$Reviewer: Nostalgia and I, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$"(If you don't respond well to popular anti-depressants, give this one a try!!!)
I've taken almost every SSRI there is (well, it seems that way) and they all have made my depression, anxiety/panic disorder, paranioa, etc, worse. My reactions ranged from hearing things, imagining strange(r) things, enragement, increased depression, increased suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, etc. My doctor, at the time, immediately said I was bi-polar because of this. Now just because SSRI's make my conditions worse, it CAN mean I have bi-polar but I never have been manic in my life. I was told I have bi-polar II. No sky-high high's but the lowest of the lows lasting from 2-6 weeks. Fast forward 2 years and now I've been on every anti-seizure med, mood stabilizer and bi-polar med from Depakote to Lithium to Abilify, Trazadone, Seroquel, etc. I finally switched doctors after years of no improvement. After a look at my file, my new Doc says he wants to try and older anti-depressant; one that works differently than the ones you see on TV these days. We started low just in case my usual reactions began. I'm now on 200mg daily and feeling great. I still feel apathetic and unmotivated to some extent but the depression is almost gone. Yes I still have my ""days"" but I'm able to go to work everyday. I think I used 400+ hours of sick time the year before last. But with a combination of this, valium and provigil, I seem to be in check. 
If you react backwards to current anti-depressants or if they worsen your conditions, give this stuff a try. It's stopped suicidal thoughts/ideations, self isolation, feelings of worthlessness, and basically the loss all pleasure in my life. Truly something to try if you're sick of going from med to med."
58$Depression$8/14/2009 2:21:01 PM$Reviewer: marcie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$2$4$"Actually,  this medication worked better for me than any other one I've tried.  However, the side effects became intolerable.   My heart would race with the slightest exertion, putting a stop to swimming.  My hand were ICY cold -- which, as a nurse, my patients did not appreciate.  But what got me to quit it was that it caused vaginal bleeding -- my periods which had always been irregular started coming at shorter and shorter intervals until I was spotting all the time.   I asked the doctor if it could be due to the med, and he said no.  So, I had a biopsy of the uterine lining done -- painful and I had no insurance, so out of pocket expense.  Thankfully, it showed no malignancy.   

Taking things into my own hands, I quit taking the medication.   Within a week, the spotting stopped completely."
61$Depression$6/14/2009 12:40:45 AM$Reviewer: Sojourn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$2$The dose i am currently on is 25mg a day. It helps with the depression to some degree. Goal success dose was at least 100mg a day. I very slowly - half a 25mg increased it each week until reaching 75mg a day. But it dried my mouth out so bad, it was driving me crazy. Dr. suggested Biotene gum to increase saliva - and it did, but would only last for about 20 minutes and I had to chew it constantly, so it was like adding a new expensive med to my treatment plan & don't have insurance. Of course, the dryness also created a bad taste in my mouth, so I was also concerned about bad breath. Dr. said I wasn't close to effective dose, so I backed down to 25mg and he added mood stabilizer - Lamictal, which is another story. In my case, I seem to be especially prone to side effects of many medications at very low doses, so I think that is one reason Desipramine did not work well for me. Oh, and it was very constipating and I have gallbladder disease, which also has that affect - so couldn't tolerate both together. Don't have money for gallbladder surgery, so had two reasons for really cutting down on Desipramine. Have tried everything else on market for depression over 20 years, so the fact that 25mg helps to a degree is why I haven't changed.
