The Bupropion was somewhat ineffective for ADHD, but helped with the anxiety and depression, so we added focalin/dexmethylphenidate. I am still taking 300mg Bupropion XL and added 10mg dexmethylphenidate er. I am very happy with the results. I feel more focused, have a much greater attention to detail, I am more aware of my surroundings (due to less daydreaming), just overall almost off my ADHD symptoms are significantly reduced. I experienced a very mild headache the first couple of days as well as extreme sleepiness in the afternoon, but a week later, those side effects have subsided. The first couple of days I also felt like I was at a loss of words, like I couldn't form coherent sentences and spoke sort of robotic, that also went away. My only issue is that it's going to be a pain to refill, since it's a controlled drug. It's also not in stock at most pharmacies, so I either have to ask around before my doctor fills it, or wait. Kind of a pain, but worth it in the end.

Although those medicines have given me genuine emotion back, I still feel tired most of the time even with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and consistent sleep schedule.  We hoped this would give me energy.  It did give me a little more energy for working, but I felt emotionless, thus negating the positive effects of my antidepressants, so it wasn’t right for me.  Also, the vivid dreams I had while on the medication were sometimes unpleasant.

This med has helped both boys focus and seems to be very effective.Both boys began on brand name focolin and had few side effects, 8 yo seemed to chew on things alot such as bottle tops etc, the 11 yo had bouts of loss of appetite. No other side effects boys only took meds during school hours, no weekends or summer and breaks from school. Teachers saw drastic improvement in both. Our family moved to another state and was prescribed the generic form both boys had severe side effects had to discontinue med. Will request ONLY brand name from now on, no generic substitutes. My rating above is based on focolin xr NOT generic form of dexmethyphenidate hcl, I rate generic as 0.

Focalin/dexmethylphenidate is really the last one we hadn't tried. It's potentcy is double the strength of Ritalin and Methylin. Which was the last med I was prescribed before making the switch to the generic Focalin. The FDA suggested max dose is 20mg daily, due to the severity of my ADHD, my doctor has me on 35mg a day. I do not feel anxious and get headaches as other users have noticed from when they take it. I can't say the medicine makes me feel depressed because I also have a mood disorder, in which I take medication for as well. I am very please with how Focalin has helped me, in the classroom, at my job, and just in my everyday life. I notice that I am able to sit and focus on one task for as long as I need to and can sit still in my classes without feeling jittery or the need to talk to others around me. At work, I noticed that I can sit at my cubicle all shift and my mind doesn't wander off to ""la la land"" as my mom calls it. Overall, I am pleased with Focalin. The 2 side effects I notice are loss of appetite and loss of sleep, but those 2 side effects have effected me with literally EVERY other ADHD med as well. I've been taking Focalin for almost 3 years, and will mostly have to be on the medication the rest of my life. Focalin has been the most effective med for treating my case of ADHD"

5$Condition: Other$4/24/2012 11:41:42 AM$Reviewer: AmazingMed, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $5$5$5$My 10 year old daughter started taking Focalin in 2nd grade when she was 7. Her ADD had gotten so bad that her teacher & I couldn't get her to do anything. We were both at wits end. The moment she started taking Focalin she was like a different person. Ever since then she has been a straight A student & voracious reader. It made me realize that a lot of what seemed like willful behavior was not. We tried Ritalin, Adderall, & Vyvanse in an effort to get the best results & fewest side effects. Focalin was the only thing that worked miracles. She was virtually comatose on Vyvanse. Between 2nd & 5th grade she went from 5mg XR to 30mg XR. By 5th grade she was at the maximum dose for her size but still had trouble getting homework done & sleeping & eating. Over Spring Break, in an effort to get her to eat, I gave her 10mg short acting Focalin instead of the 30mg XR. When she started back to school we changed her to 10mg in the morning & 10mg after lunch. WOW, what a difference! Now she sleeps better, eats better & comes home with virtually no no homework. Best of all, she is so much happier. School is no longer a burden.

On this drug I have gone from C's to A's and B's. The side effects that suck personally for me are the stomach cramps and mood swings. When I take the pill I feel like a zombie all day and I'm not very nice to be around. But perhaps results vary from person to person.
7$Condition: Other$9/1/2009 6:53:06 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$4$My son started taking this medication when he was 7 years old for ADD, his phycologist said he wasn't focusing on anything that they would talk about and she also said he was bipolar and had mild depression. She put him on the generic Focalin, he took this medication for a few weeks and he slowed down everything he did like he was in slow motion. It would take him longer to do simple things, like when eating he would still be setting at the table and the rest of the family had finished eating and it looked like he just started eating and we started like 20 minutes earlier. To eat a regular size bowl of cereal it would take him 30 to 40 minutes. It was like he was so high off the meds he couldn't do anything the way he did before taking the medicine. They also put him on bipolar pills (Abifly, don't know correct spelling) which made him high also. My son is now 9 years old and hasn't taken the meds in 2 years and is back to his old self, this drug may work well for others but not my child. I don't thing that my son id depressed or bipolar, but yes he does have ADD.

This past month we received the generic form dexmethylphenidate this past month our son has not been able to focus @ home or school to the point that the school nurse called me yesterday to ask if our son was still taking his meds @ home!! I have never thought generics were any different than brand names, but I truly believe that this generic form is less effective than the brand name so from now on we will have our DR. write D.A.W.

16$Condition: Other$5/19/2017 9:09:16 PM$Reviewer: Jiggity, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$5$This medication is powerful and not to be taken lightly. It does has side effects. As a 27 year old man with a technical career working on multi-million dollar machines this medication has helped me greatly. Downside as a married man is sex-life(it makes you feel naturally uninterested) and social life(you just don't care, I have a family and finances to run, the love is not gone just the empathy for the small things). Also there are at times, though rare, that you feel an impending doom...The impending doom I always realize at the time is false and it's just anxiousness but it does cause it some times. For me the benefits have really helped my career. It's been completely worth taking it. Learning faster and being more interested in tasks that my original self thought were mundane or would never of thought to pick up. It's helpful. I do plan to wane myself off of it and perform as normal but I feel it has helped my brain retain information and learn and take a interest in learning when I needed it most. Especially when it's your career and it's how you feed your family. Weird positive side effect it has made my bowel movements regular. Most negative weird side effect shortly after taking is gagging and or vomitting induced by my smoking tobacco habbit or eating. It makes eating breakfast very hard. Which is a shame.

He has gastrointestinal issues while on it that cause extreme gas. Secondly his eyes went from 20/20 vision to 20/50 vision that glasses cannot correct all within 18 months. This is one of the severe side effects. Please beware of putting your Child on this drug.I pray his vision gets better after stopping this drug.

Before i say anything bad about this drug, it does help with focusing..but almost helps too much. My grades improved dramatically when i started taking this, but my social life plummeted. I started feeling anxious, depressed and I couldn't really hold a conversation until the end of the day on the bus when it was wearing off. My parents didn't really see much difference in me because it wears off within the hour i get home, but yes, there is a huge difference (at least for me.) I don't recommend this drug to anyone who is creative and has a hyper lifestyle (Me.) It makes you a different person, almost zombie like because its hard to hold on just one social conversation. I think that was the main reason i didnt like it, all my friends were asking if i was sick or sad etc. and i would just say im not having a good day because its too hard to explain to them because i just dont have the motivation. luckily i only take this medicine on the weekdays and not on the weekends so im normal all weekend. Overall it just makes my life a little bit more hard to deal with because of my hyper, happy lifestyle....but it also helps with school. So its your choice. Do you want a more happy lifestyle and be social? or get better grades, but not be social whatsoever. I had to choose the not social way because of my grades, but because of so many conversations i have missed out on with my friends i wish i had taken another medicine. 
20$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/2/2015 4:28:30 PM$Reviewer: redheadok, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$My 6 y/o son was having many behavioral problems at his daycare. Basically he had daily incidents that led to phone calls for me to pick him up because they couldn't calm him down. I took him to a behavior therapist and after a month of visits and questionnaires completed by parents and teachers, he was diagnosed with ADHD + ODD. Although I strongly believe a large part of the problem was the adult's mishandling of the situation, when the ODD kicked in he was physical with anyone near and hurt (not seriously) people. At the recommendation of our pediatrician (who has known my 6 y/o son since birth) and the therapist, we started him on Vayarin and 5 mg of Focalin XR. We did notice a slight improvement with the 5 mg; however, over the course of the next 2 months we walked him up to 10 mg and then 15 mg. We always started a new dose on the weekend so we could monitor him closely. For the first 1-2 days he would have a headache, but it was nothing that prevented him from his normal daily activities. I do notice some excessive sweating and he often sleeps without his shirt because he's too warm. However, the benefits in his case have FAR outweighed those two cons. My child is NOT a zombie, which was a fear of ours before starting the medication. I notice immediately when the medicine takes effect and leaves his system. Multiple teachers at his school have raved about what a wonderful child he is. Now he can focus, complete tasks, and sit still for longer periods of time. I know his teacher has a great amount of experience with ADHD, so she has been incredible during this process. We also recently started behavior therapy at the CDC. My ultimate goal is to wean him off the Focalin XR; however, it has made a tremendous difference in our lives for the last few months. I have zero regrets for using it as a (hopefully) temporary crutch to help as we further develop his coping skills and work to decrease his impulsivity.

The medicine itself works great for attention, but oh god the side effects.
These are the side effects that i have, and i have been taking it for 8 years and it has caused many of these to be longlasting but overall i have mostly stopped due to them. Everything from lack of hunger, Anxiety, and depression has happened in extreme degrees. the anxiety expecially as i was so shy in  high school, one girl that i talked too when i finally stopped taking this stuff legitimatly thought i was a mute when she met me.

Summary:
It may work but at the cost of HORRIBLE anxiety and long lasting depression, i wrote this after a trigger from said depression over something minor that the depression was bad enough to remove my will to do anything for almost a hour. And this was all from one minor thing."

When you stop taking the OPINION of the prescribing doctor as anything more than an educated guess, you can resort to your own knowledge and experience. Loss of appetite means lack of nutrient intake, which our bodies need in order to function properly, i.e. our brains, without proper nutrition our brain cannot focus correctly, now for the HD side of AD/HD what is taken into the body is as important as how much, for instance, water over soda, less sugar loaded snacks (candy). These things combined with some quality adult interaction and intervention, appropriate disciple when needed, and a realistic expectation or individualism, and the opportunity to productively use excess energy that is different for every living thing and can't be lumped into an easy fix diagnosis called AD/HD and simply take a pill for it and alter the natural chemical process in the human body. AD/HD is one of the most over-diagnosed disorders to date because its easier to shove a pill down a kids throat than it is to be a parent.

I am aware that our bodies’ can react differently to certain medications; luckily, being an adult allows us to better vocalize our reactions to these medications. With that said, of the three ADD medications, Adderall (hands-down!) worked best for me. However, my doctor has stopped prescribing Adderall due to its ""street value"". Therefore, I started taking Vyvanse instead and though it served its purpose, it simply wasn’t the same. Each day I had to take half of a capsule in the morning and the other around noon because taking all of it at once presented anxiety (which I was not accustom to) and when that would finally pass, I was left feeling exhausted. Although I was able to accommodate to Vyvanse, I felt as if my body (and wallet!) needed a change, so I did some research and talked to my doctor about Focalin.  My doc didn't know much about Focalin, but was intrigued by its description and prescribed it to me. I thought it would be OK at first, but I have come to realize that it is not. Much like my initial Vyvanse experience, I receive more jitters/anxiety side effects than I do actual concentration. Not to mention the intense urge to “break in” the nearest toilet...  I honestly feel this medication is doing more harm than help. Like I previously said, I know certain people react differently to medications than others; however, I can't help but feel concerned for those children taking Focalin and are experiencing similar side effects, but are unable to express them properly. With this, I would simply like for parents to be aware."

For my family this was a huge burden. They did not like how hyperactive I could be, but being energetic and creative is who I was. They had me take Focalin, for ADHD when I was 16, even though if you have anxiety you shouldn't take it. I told them I didn't like how it made me feel but they kept me on it anyways. They were desperate to calm me down and improve my grades. My grades improved but my mood plummeted. I had panic attacks every other day, became suicidal, cried in the hallways and was mean to my friends. When I tried to tell my parents this they said that I was behaving fine at home. I was a zombie at home! I sat around in bed and I slept, I lost fifteen pounds (to weigh a whopping 95 lbs at 5'5)They told me that my friends liked how hyper I was and that's why my friends agreed that this drug changed me. I told my doctor I no longer wanted to take it, and when he said that was okay my parents became very angry and suddenly decided he didn't know what he was talking about. I finally stopped taking it after six months. I have a lot of problems but I try to handle it as it comes. Talking to my doctor helps. But this medication was not for me. I had all the emotional side effects, but my parents were more concerned about what they considered my ""behavioral problems"". They wanted a zombie kid but I didn't want to be one, it made me want to die. I now live away from home and though I still have panic attacks now and again, and I still obviously get easily distracted, I understand myself and what I need better than they do. I do not recommend this drug for kids who are overly creative along with hyper, because it kills your creative abilities and turns you into someone else. I'm sure it works for some people and that is fantastic, but listen to your kid too. If they don't like it, try something else."

This pill does exactly what it's supposed to do, but he's a completely different child. He used to love to play and was always happy and smiling. Now, my husband and I only see him this way in the morning when he wakes up, and if we keep him up past his bedtime since the medication has worn off. He's a zombie. He doesn't smile much anymore, he can pay attention to you, but he looks empty. It's so heartbreaking. The only difference with him than the things I've read is that he doesn't have trouble sleeping, there are days he sleeps for 12 hours at night, and takes a 2 hour or more nap. I think if it were my choice, he wouldn't be on this. I miss the little boy that's locked up inside of him after he takes this.

She is never hungry. When she eats she's very irratated and settles for bread, pasta and butter, and sweets.  Waking up in the middle of the night as times to eat these terrible foods.  This has gone on for two year; we just found our she has lymphoma hodgkin's cancer.  I have not done any research. It is my understanding that without the proper nutrition the body doesn't function properly and could it be possible that this medication assisted the cancer to grow. It obviously makes one lose appetite, therefore, it seems that the lymps don't function properly causing low immune system.

I was afraid so only gave him 1/3 of the capsule the first day; he complained of a mild (2-5) headache throughout the day, but he was happy cause he could focus and complete his work.  The next day I gave him 1/2 of the 15mg pill.  This caused pressure in his head (8 on a 1-10 scale), pressure in his chest, weakness in his left arm and hand.  I immediately rushed him to the ER.  On our way day, he was telling me that he was seeing the civil war, Abraham Lincoln, the buildings on fire; he recognized that it could not be real, but they looked real to him.  When we arrived at the ER, they kept him 12 hrs under observation and sent us home with instructions not to take the Focalin anymore (of course).  The ER Doctor told me that had I given my son the full 15mg, he could have had a heart attack.  His EKG was normal and my son has no history of heart problems.

I started taking Focalin around the time I was diagnosed and immediately noticed a difference. I became withdrawn, depressed, unable to carry a conversation with others, it became hard for me to sleep well, eat well, stay asleep, and so on. When I was younger I hated Focalin so much that I would spit it out before I left to catch me bus. Also, because it would ware off by the time I got home my parents never believed I was like a zombie. One day I decided to prove it and take it on a weekend so they could see. They were so concerned for me that they held a little intervention at the end of the day. At that intervention I told them that I took my Focalin and they didn't make me take it anymore. Around age 14 I decided I wanted to take it again. I hated Focalin more than anything else, however, my grades had slipped immensely and I needed help paying attention. After taking the Focalin for a month I was able to pass the classes I had been failing before. Now I'm getting straight A's. Still, after all of this, I find Focalin to be torture. An extremely effective form of torture. And now, I feel as though I NEED Focalin to function properly in society and be a better version of myself. Please, if your child is having any similar symptoms, find a new drug, or a new tactic. Don't let them end up like me.

However the last two weeks he has been having major  sleep issues. Pharmacist told me when I was looking for melatonin that while most a.d.d. meds ""feel"" like they are worn off they are still in your system and can cause sleep issues. Going to call pediatrician today. Maybe what some of these kids with high energy levels need are sports/excercise to calm their body down. Son does sports 3 days a week but middle school they stop running around outside like they used to when they were in elementary school. Not sure what it is. Def. meds have helped with grades and focus. 6th grade squeaking by with mostly Cs. 7th Grade with meds. all A's and one B. But sleep is definitely an issue."

Special Education, good diet and exercise, and A LOT of homework help at home helped, but she still required a lot of redirection and one-on-one time at school from her teachers.  We finally agreed with her doctor to try a medication.  We tried Concerta and it was terrible.  Too strong for her!  She was tearful and suffered insomnia and nightmares.  We asked the doctor what else we could try.  He prescribed the lowest dose of Focalin... 10mg.  It worked!!!  The difference in her behavior was like night and day and it didn't affect her sweet personality at all.  I didn't tell her teachers so I could really see if they noticed a difference, and they immediately saw a change in her school performance.  She was less impulsive, she stayed on task, and she actually finished assignments!  At home she was able to do more things like getting dressed on her own, cleaning her room, doing most her own homework without me prompting her every five minutes.  We found that giving her half a pill in the morning and half at lunch (the school helps us with that) worked best for her (it seems to last 5 hours).   After school homework time was a challenge since the Rx had worn off, but her Dr. prescribed a 2mg dose as needed for these days, and it works really well.  She is still able to sleep by 8PM.  She still has a good appetite too (which worried me).  It is available in generic form so it's easily affordable. The only problem with this Rx is that it isn't long-acting so you need to give a booster dose mid day.  But we haven't found this to be difficult for now.  I hope this helps someone out there!  It has been a life-saver for our sweet daughter!

It has had the least negative side effects and has no ""afternoon crash"" which I experienced with other medicines we tried first. 

It helps me listen when someone is speaking, be more productive at work, and has helped me feel calmer overall.

I was constantley getting phone calls from his 1st grade teacher about how he was behaving in class and how he was just down right refusing to be still. I decided to have him tested basically to rule out this condition. His dr placed him on this medicine and it was remarkable. He is not a ""zombie"" while on this. He is still able to play with his friends and be a normal child without the impluse to do what he wants in class. His conduct grade went from a very low D to 100% A.  
I have recomended that other parents that I know of who are having the same issues with their children in school to talk to their drs about this medicine.
Every morning my son makes sure that his medicine is next to his breakfast plate so he will not get in trouble in school."

I have never been so productive at both work and home in my life.  Also the quality of the work I do has dramatically increased to the point that several of my co-workers, one of which includes my supervisor have made positive comments regarding my work.  I noticed on some of the posts that side effects are bothersome for some so I feel that I should say that it took about 2 months for my body to adjust to the medicine, after that, everything has just seemed to improve for me.  My most annoying side effect has to be headaches which have decreased in both severity and frequency over the past 6 months.

In the beginning, I felt like there was no hope of her bringing home any grade above a ""C."" She was placed on Focalin XR as part of her regimen and I'm happy to say that I have seen overwhelming improvement in her abilities to concentrate on tasks and follow through with instruction. I cannot say where she would be without her Psychiatrist and the treatment she has received, but without it she wouldn't be Student of the Month and Class Vice-President now. Her teacher stated that she was ""One of her Best Students"" during our last conference.  Her grades have sky-rocketed and I am very satisfied with what she has accomplished with the help from this medication. Being a mother and psychiatric health care professional myself, I highly recommend this medication for all of those who have tried everything else. It has made a world of difference for my daughter.

But although it can be a challenge to help her focused without it, I refuse to give her any more, I deal with her behavior the best I can, because her physical health is of great importance. I read several comments and i truely believe that the dosage that most mentioned giving their kids is crazzy. Its great for school because teachers really dont want any more work than they have to. But as parents, lets find other ways to treat our kids than with narcotics, which is what these drugs are, legal narcotics.

The first day I took it I felt that I actually wanted to do things,cleaning, homework, laundry.  I do all of those anyway but it's like I have to force myself.  I work full time and go to college full time. I do feel that it is helping a little.  I don't feel like I'm all amped up or anything. More like, clearer. The only side effects are very very mild.  Feeling not very hungry.  Which is fine by me, because I also take Welbutrin XL 300mg and Seroquel 400mg which made me gain like 30lbs in the last six months.  I'm still eating well. Just not allllll the time like before. I also noticed a sort of heavy feeling in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.  Not sure what that is about.  I'll be sure to ask my Dr about it though.  It usually only happens if I take it on an empty stomach.  But other than that I can't tell I'm taking it.  I was scared starting ADD medication because I hear alot of terrible things about being zombie like, mean, moody.. and so on.  So I'm going to stick with it and see how it plays out until my next appointment in a month.

I was in denial and tried so hard to help him but finally I had to help him with this because it was more than I knew how to deal with (and I have a BS in ECH EDU).  I took him to a child psychiatrist last Novemeber and he has been on 5mg of Focalin since January.  I took him off of it for a month during the summer and sometimes I don't know if I really see a difference in behavior or not.  He seems too be more calm but he is very moody.  He started Kindergarten last week and we are still getting complaints about his behavior and attention issues.  I will talk to his Dr. about this next month but I feel for all parents and children who have to live with this.  It's a lot to deal with...  I just pray it gets easier somehow for my son.

After trying Stratera for a few days, my doctor changed me to Focalin 5 mg twice daily.  The Stratera did not work for me, made me very drowsey, wicked cotton mouth, upset stomach and the ever onmious ""sexual side effects""  but alarmingly it gave me very gruesome nightmares.  I've never had that happen before, so the doctor changed me to Focalin after only 4 days.

Wow what a lifesaver.  I'm currently in school fulltime because of a career change.  With the ADD I was unable to work and go to school at the same time, to the point where my parents offered to support me while in school.  The ADD was just too much for me to do both.  After only a few weeks, I can say that this drug has saved me.  Finally I can concentrate fully and not get distracted.  This has allowed me to start working again while in school, so I am extremely happy.

As for side effects, I've been pretty happy with the dose I'm on.  The only real side effect for me is loss of weight, which at my age isn't something I'm going to complain about too much! lol  I do have to remind myself to eat, and it's a weird sensation to go a whole day without eating and not be hungry.  It's amazing in that respect.  Other than that I have no complaints.

One last comment is regarding sleep problems.  I have suffered through many many sleepness nights because of the ADD.  It is not unusual for me to be up until 3 or 4 am everynight because I couldn't quiet my mind enough.  I take this drug twice daily, six hours apart.  In a roundabout way, Focalin has relieved the sleep problems, because by the end of the day I seem pretty well spent.  I workout 3 times weekly and I seem to have more energy now due to the Focalin.  The workouts and the Focalin ensure that I am dead tired by 10 pm.  This is a fast acting drug and I feel it within 5 minutes of taking it on an empty stomach.  It doesn't make me feel ramped up, I do have a lot of energy when taking it."

Eating was much easier on Focalin than other stimulants, while they'll say they aren't hungry I can at least get them to eat something, ie fruit, cookies, cheese.

The Bupropion was somewhat ineffective for ADHD, but helped with the anxiety and depression, so we added focalin/dexmethylphenidate. I am still taking 300mg Bupropion XL and added 10mg dexmethylphenidate er. I am very happy with the results. I feel more focused, have a much greater attention to detail, I am more aware of my surroundings (due to less daydreaming), just overall almost off my ADHD symptoms are significantly reduced. I experienced a very mild headache the first couple of days as well as extreme sleepiness in the afternoon, but a week later, those side effects have subsided. The first couple of days I also felt like I was at a loss of words, like I couldn't form coherent sentences and spoke sort of robotic, that also went away. My only issue is that it's going to be a pain to refill, since it's a controlled drug. It's also not in stock at most pharmacies, so I either have to ask around before my doctor fills it, or wait. Kind of a pain, but worth it in the end.

At one point I was wondering if I was alone. My 9 year old son has ADHD and is on the spectrum. I started out with Vvaynse and it was terrible made him angry and then I switched to a non stimulant Intuniv which took over a month to work and I had to up the mg because of his body weight and it still didn't work how I wanted. He was still having behavior out burst at school ( this started this school year) I have now switched to Focalin 10 mg so far slight headaches in the morning and afternoon no appetite and not sleeping again as well as he did on Intuniv ( which made him couldn't get up to use the restroom in the middle of the night) but the moment it wears off he eats everything in sight.

It made a considerable difference in his school work and he gets in less trouble for talking when he shouldn't, getting up when he shouldn't etc. but it makes him somewhat dulled, crabby and distant especially when it starts to wear off. I don't usually give it to him on the weekends or in the summer and his sweet and bubbly personality comes back. I wish I didn't have to give it to him but he cannot control his impulses at school without it. I know alot of doctors say that there doesn't need to be a break but my advise is to only give it for school and let the body and mind be medication free whenever possible.

Her performance and behavior in school improved immediately and her grades have been all A's and B's.  She does have a little trouble falling asleep at night, so I give her a 3mg melatonin and that works very well.  Her behavior at home is normal and appropriate for her age.  We did try to go to the next dose up at one point, but then she had side effects and we had to go back to the 5 mg--and I won't change it.  I hated to have to put her on anything, but she had been getting notes sent home since preschool almost daily and I think it was really effecting her self esteem.  I always tell her the medicine can only do so much, you have to be aware of your actions and take control of yourself.  If you're on the fence about using an ADHD med--then do a trial of this one in the lowest dose.  My daughter only uses it during the school week and doesn't take it on weekends or vacations.  It is not the type of med that has to build up in your system to be effective and you can easily go off of it without problems.

My son has debilitating ADHD.  He has a spectrum disorder as well, and requires an aide in school.  I did not want to medicate him, but I felt I had no choice if I wanted him to live a normal life with friends, learning, fun, etc.  So we started 5mg once a day.  I give it to him at 9 am and it lasts till about 9 pm.  The hyper behavior is gone. Almost completely.  His beligerance is also pretty much gone.  He cries a lot easier, but we deal with that with our words.  He is one of those kids who talks about his feelings with no problems so we are trying to battle the weepiness with talking.... which we could never do before.  I don't think I've had a conversation lasting more than 8 seconds with my son since the day he was born and now we talk about everything.  We play games, do puzzles, all things he couldn't do before.  He does Soccer and listens to the coach and has fun instead of constant outbursts.  Side effects have included lack of appetite, my suggestion is give tasty high calorie snacks all day long, our favorite are veggie chips, health shakes and yogurts.  I also don't like that he focuses TOO MUCH on one activity, and will do it, quietly for hours if I don't intervene.  Strange, but he seems happier.  MUCH happier.

I had been on Ritalin and Concerta as a young kid to early teen, and had to stop taking concerta because of irregular heartbeat that was developed.Fortunately it did go away. Focalin XR has been life changing. I am a young model and I travel and fly all the time, so it's great for helping me stay organized. As from any ADHD stimulant medication, I do experience a lot of anxiety,sometimes. For this reason, my doctor also has me on Ativan 1mg which is a benzodiazepine anxiolytic/sedative/musclerelaxer similar to low dose Valium and Xanax. This combination IS safe in low doses and keeps my heart from beating too fast from Focalin XR. I would highly recommend that anyone with anxiety problems from Focalin XR talk to their DR about adding a small dose of Klonopin or Ativan. Yes, these can be addictive medications, but if they are taken as they were meant to be and under parental/doctor supervision, there is really nothing to worry about, but if you absolutely cannot go with the benzos and want something entirely non-addictive for FocalinXR anxiety you could also ask for gabapentin (generic Neurontin). The great thing about all 3 of the anti-anxiety drugs I listed is that all are available in generic forms, hence, much cheaper. That matters when you're buying FocalinXR every month...lol. I Hope this helps!

Over the years, I adapted to the scatter-brained, distracted feeling of ADHD -- don't like it but I've used it productively, successfully (juggling lots of work and activity at once). The more destructive symptom of ADHD is the constant chasing a rush (of dopamine) and the anxiety and depression that follows when rush is over.
Taking the meds doesn't help me focus as much as give me a euphoric high, it is speed after all. 
I feel like I'm on a smaller dose of a street drug like speed or cocaine. Can't imagine giving it to kids. "

Before then I did poorly in school and had no ability  to focus. After I started taking Concerta my school performance increased. However, Concerta had very severe side effects. Quite often I would forget to eat some days because I did not feel hungry although I should have been. I switched to Focalin XR a few years ago (currently at a 40mg dose, combined with 5mg-10mg of short acting depending on the day) the school performance has still been great but now I do not experience the same level of side effects. I noticed that someone asked if when taking the medication you experience nausea. Yes, if you have nothing on your stomach you will experience severe nausea and stomach pain for about 1-2 minutes when the medication is kicking in. One other thing to note, my hands and feat sweat an abnormal amount when I am on the medication. But other than that, I am currently in all honors and AP classes and have a 4.5 gpa. I would not have this without the medication. The benefits outweigh the downsides in my mind. I would recommend it to anyone struggling with ADHD.

For the past six months he's not had one good day at school. The Dr. prescribed 5mg a day. The first day I saw a different child. We spent two hours in a waiting room and he sat quietly reading and playing his PSP. About six hours after the first dose, he complained of being very hot, so hot that he was going to vomit. After I made him more comfortable, he immediately came down with a migraine. Day 2 he crashed out only after a couple of hours and had increased anxiety. Scared of natural disasters and he made the comment that he did not feel safe with me. He felt as though I was going to leave him. He was very paranoid and scared to death of everything. I'm not giving him the meds on the weekend. I plan to try again on Monday and if he still has issues, I will contact the doctor to try a different medication. Anyone have any suggestions?

Since being diagnosed and starting 20mg XR a day I have figured out my own patterns of adjusting to the medicine.  To start, I was told that it lasts only 8 hours.  Honestly, I feel the effects for 12-15+.  I have to manage when I take it or else it affects my eating and sleeping pattens.  With it I have seen an improvement in my grades, so it does out way the side-effects.  I want to make clear that it has helped tremendously in my college career, my only advice is to make sure you or your child are on a strict regulated schedule, that way you will there will be a diminished chance for side effects.

He also has a great deal of anxiety along with ADHD.  We have seen very good results as far as behavior.  He is doing better in school.  He says he feels a lot less anxious when taking it and the ""channels aren't changing in his brain"". We notice his interactions with us and others is much better when taking medication.  His impulse control is greatly reduced!  Our only concern is that he does experience a ""come down"" usually around 8PM (he usually takes about 7AM).  If we are home he does fine, but if he is out he sometimes gets very anxious and nervous for about an hour until it completely wears off.  However, the positive results far out weigh this occasional problem.  It is VERY expensive and there doesn't seem to be much help for middle class families who do have insurance coverage but not much for medications.  We have decided it is worth the cost, but definitely a sacrifice in the wallet!  Wonder about children who have families that don't have the option do, very sad."

I have been on Focalin XR 10 mg for 30 days and have defintely seen an improvement in my focus.  When I first started the medication it was almost as if the brakes were being applied to the multitude of thoughts that would run through my mind so that I could more easily focus on the item that I wanted to address.
The same thing occured when listening to a conversation from someone that was speaking to me.
It does not eliminate all those extra thought distractions but it has defintely reduced them significantly so that I can focus better.
I like others wish that we would of had this type of medication and understanding of ADHD when we were growing up but at least it's comforting to know that our children and grandchildren will have a chance to address it in a more positive way in the future. "

My son is 8, but we have been struggling and going through testing with this as well as a speech delay since the age of 2, hoping he would out grow the issues we face and knowing he was too young to diagnose and being afraid to medicate so early. he received speech therapy from the age 2-almost 5, and started kindergarten with out speech therapy. His behavior started becoming an issue between the ages of 2-3 (which i felt could have been a result of not being understood with his speech delay). At the age of 5 we finalized with the doctors saying he was too young to diagnose, with thoughts of him out growing the issues, and contacting them later if needed. We have delt with a LOT of behavior issues in school, including suspension in 1st grade, several disiplinary notes, meetings held at school, etc. My son is now in 3rd grade and is expressing verbally how hard it is to control himself. We have decided to try medication after being able to think on it for 3 years and my son noticing things within himself. This is only day 2 of taking meds and the first one we have tried, i will update as we go along, i have pretty much made myself sick trying to be observant on how this is effecting my son, and trying to distingish regular from irregular side effects. i know i am not the only one, so i will update.

Boys will be boys, but he was WAY beyond a typical, energetic kid.  We stopped going to church because Sunday school teachers had him in time-out most of the class and couldn't handle him. I didn't go to the grocery alone with him, only if my husband could be there to help corral him. Our pediatricians nurse suggested that he needed more discipline.  I started crying! I said, ""He spends most of his time in time out, we've even tried spanking, rewarding doesn't work, I can't friggin' discipline him any more than I do!  FYI- his 8 year old brother has NEVER been in trouble at school, is always polite, I knew it wasn't our parenting.  Our son needed help.  He's not a bad kid, he's just impulsive and can't focus or control himself. We started on Concerta and got major symptom relief.  However, after 6 months my son had actually lost weight and he had major trouble falling asleep(like up until midnight). We switched to Focalin XR. He eats, gains weight, and sleeps!!! We are very pleased. He's on 10mg at 7:00am and has to take a 2.5mg(non-XR) around 2-3pm because it wears off.  I just called the Dr. to discuss trying 15 mg XR in the morn because he is struggling a bit in kindergarten with following the rules, focusing, etc.  He's still worlds better than before the medication!  Basically, we like Focalin more than Concerta because his true personality still shines through(not a zombie), he eats great, and he sleeps 
better.  Once we get the dosage fine tuned I know he'll be good to go. I wish he didn't need any medication, but I'm thankful we have found something to help our son.  He's not the ""bad kid"" anymore. People get to know the real him and that's a beautiful thing!"

The only side effect I notice, is that I have post-nasal drip, and this drug seems to make it much worse about 1 hour after taking it.  Usually it involves me throwing up until I can get rid of the phlegm, then I'm fine.  But Focalin works so well, I just deal with it.   I'm working with my allergist to see if there is anything else that can be done for the post-nasal drip.

I used to take Concerta 135mg until last summer where I switched to Focalin XR 30mg. The decrease in appetite ceased. Also, I could sleep when on the medication. This may be because I am used to it and the side effects that stimulants have but it is nice. Also to those who ask why there child cant sleep. It is because the medication lasts 12-15 hours and is a stimulant so it will keep them up. Don't use the XR if it is past 11am use the normal focalin or they wont sleep. I also twitch and have shaky hands but it is not that bad. My school performance has increased dramatically since I started taking medication for ADHD. I would recommend this medication.

It begun with 10mg, but teacher said child was a zombie.
It went down to 5 MG.
It changed my child completely. 
Wince a happy loving active child, it turned her into a robot like kid. Her expressions changed. Aches and pains all over her body happened daily.
Disabilitating headaches were a daily thing.
She was also beginning to have a numbness feeling in her hands and feet. Weird.
What it did good - her teacher was happy. She didn't have to help the kid to accomplish her tasks. 
My thought today - after giving Focalin for 1 1/2 year to my second grade child is that the pill definitely speed them up.
But that is how these pills are called, right? Speed.
I do not think it helped the child. Even though she finished her work independently, she would have finished the same work with a little more teacher attention without the pill.
There is a book - ADHD Fraud - that opened my eyes.
The only thing the pill accomplish is to let the teacher have a better life. It destroys the child brain - shrinks it over time - and also changes the child healthy heart into a diseased one, with physical changes.
What we got out of the experience - change the child school before you dope your child. Focalin is a dope and the results only benefit the teacher.
Give the teacher a speed pill and keep the children unharmed.
My child will not be in a pill anymore.
She does have a slow nature and giving her speed drugs won't change her nature.
The side effects are not worthy.
And your doctor will not tell you that.
As a matter of fact, my child doctor doped his own child everyday. I cannot understand that.
I think we will be changing pediatrician also.

SAY NO TO DRUGS - including FOCALIN.

It is bad for your child.
Change the school or even homeschool before you speed her up.

Just a thought."

I feel drained of life, my mouth gets dry, I lose my appetite, I have NO desire to be talked to, and overall just feel like dying. When I first take it, the next three or four hours are alright. I am more calm, and I stay on task better. But by the time I get to my afternoon classes (where I tend to not have as much work) I start to feel like a zombie. Such as right now. Weird thing is, when I do work I don't have such a strong feeling. Like right now for example, typing this is kind of like work so I'm not wanting to jump in front of traffic as much. I guess you have to fight it, I don't know. From around 4:00pm to 9:00pm I literally just want to die and regret ever taking the medication. I take one at about 7 am and another at lunch (about 11am). I'm 17 and 140lbs if that has anything to do with it.

She was very smart and always knew the answers to everything the teacher asked, but was constantly in trouble in school because she could not sit still and could not follow directions. At home, we frequently had to deal with her temper tantrums and big meltdowns. We couldn't figure out what set her off. Her Kindergarten teacher suspected that she had ADHD and suggested that we seek a specialist for diagnoses. She was correct. The neurologist diagnosed my daughter with ADHD and prescribed her the 5 mg Focalin XR. She tried it for a week but it didn't have any noticeable effect on her. The doctor then increased the dosage to 10 mg. The effect was dramatic. It was like an on/off switch. When the medication went into effect, she was very reticent. I didn't like it because it's almost like she's completely a different person. However, she was able to sit still in class, follow directions, and concentrate on what she was doing. It boosted her self confidence because she stopped getting in trouble in school and as a result, she's more popular with the other kids. She is now 8 1/2 and is still on the same 10 mg dosage. Over time, the effect of the 10 mg medication did seem to lessen but I think she's now at a perfect balance. She is less reticent but is still able to focus in school. One major side effect of the medication is loss of appetite. She does not eat much, if any, at lunch time when the medication is in effect, so I always make sure that she eats a big, healthy breakfast before school. By dinner time, the medication has worn off, so she gets her healthy appetite back.

We both take 10mg daily for ADHD. I might need to increase my dosage since the effects are wearing off by noon if I take it at 7. 
BEST THING WE EVER DID! We can do things one at a time. We don't flit around doing a million things. We have learned how to plan short term and long term tasks/goals. Our personalities have not changed at all. We did not lose our appetites. I wish I had this when I was younger so that I could have sat still and paid attention to school and social activities with less self-interruption. We both noticed a difference the first day. No headaches or prolonged weird feelings. First and second day I experienced a total of 3 moments (2 seconds) of dizziness. It did not affect my job performance or ability to remain working with my students. I can honestly say that this medication has made a huge difference in our lives. 
Being able to sort out my thoughts and follow along in class, conversations, and my own stream of consciousness has truly improved my life. My son is less impulsive and is able to control his behaviors better."

This is the first med he has tried. His Dr insisted on putting him on 10 mg along with 5 mg of Abilify for his agressive behavior in school along with being defiant and socially detachment from others.  In the first three days we saw a drastic improvement, his teacher was not even aware that he was in the classroom.  She stated that he was so calm and focused, didn't blurt out in the class, did not get mad when he stated the wrong answer in class and begin beating himself in the head. At functions he began speaking to people instead of  rolling his eyes, balling up his fist telling them to get away or stay from him.  Sometimes he would just be sitting and get mad for no reason. He takes the focalin 10 mg around 6:15 am he catches the school bus around 6:25 (he eats breakfast before he takes his meds) the meds usually wear off around 4pm.  He takes the Abilify 5 mg approx. 6:00pm to control his aggressive behavior as of now they are working perfect together for him.  Yes he does experience dry mouth, a few headaches in which we give him a dose of childrens tylenol. when the focalin wears off he gets extremely hungry he has gained 3 lbs in 5 months.  He himself can tell the difference and feels better about taking the meds.  In his words ""Mom, I'm not tangle up and confused in the head anymore"". He had an appointment last week and the Dr. increased him to 15 mg because he is playing football and with the medication wearing off at 4pm and he is not from practice or a game until around 8:30 we will see if this hurts or help.  I will keep you posted. Our next appointment is in two weeks. Meanwhile continue to pray while using and searching for the right meds.  "

The first being ritalin the second vivanace and now focalin xr. I must say the focalin xr has been a great experience. It has fewer side effects and is more effective than the other two. I did not have a good experience with vivance. I would recommend this drug to those on the standard form of ritalin or adderall or metadate. I also noticed that the effect from the drop off of this med is better than ritalin and I sleep much better.

The Clonidine is some kind of blood pressure medication that helps relax me at the end of the day so I can sleep. Overall I feel the drug has helped me.

He is doing well now but can have playground issues when irritated by other kids. He is not a big eater for lunch when on it but eats well at night. No weight lost but sems very forgetful and lots of daytime wetting and some nighttime bedwetting. Seems to heave put on lots of weight this last 8 months. I can tell that it has worn off after school but don't mind i can handle that. I just want him to be able to function and concentrate in school.  He likes that he is not distruptive anymore and loves to be able to understand what is being taught. Sleeps well but only concerned about daytime wetting. I like the fact that he can go without it on weekends and in the summer if needed without side effects and I feel better knowing he can give his body a break.

We started out with the 15 mg dose, but increased it after it was wearing off before school ended.  At the 20 mg dose we were getting about 9 hrs coverage which was great and he was doing excellent in school academically, however he started to shut down socially.  My son does have an autistic spectrum disorder as well and the focalin just intensified his anxiety and withdrawn behaviors.  I was very pleased with how he was preforming academically, but felt he had become a zombie and was really my son.  Parents need to beware of this type of behavior.  We decreased back to 15 mg to see if the behaviors subsided some and there was marked improvement in his social behaviors.  We have since decided that the risk of blunted or withdrawn behaviors developing was not worth the excellent coverage we were getting and have discontinued the use of this medication.  We are currently working to find another medication that will provide the length of coverage as well as the results for focuse and attention without losing the little boy in the process.

My son was going to be held back in the 1st grade if he did not show any improvement fast. And this medicine is working very well he can pay attention and actually can sit still to do his work, his teacher is AMAZED! and is very proud to see him doing so good. However, coming off the medication is terrible! he gets angry, mean, and uncontrollable sometimes, I think that after the school year is over I will change the medicine to something else.

Before concerta i took ritalin but I can't take meds twice a day at my highschool. The medication does what it says i can sit still and get things done but i lack all personality and it really hinders my social life and it seems to amplify my sleeping problems. I now use Melatonin to help me fall asleep but i think i needed this before the focalin anyways. I have moved to only taking it if i know i will really need it a specific day but i try to stay off of it and control it myself which i have not been able to do until recently. I highly suggest you try to control yourself once you get to be 15-16 but until then this is a great resource. Oh it also causes some unbearable dry mouth

I think Concerta helped more with the ADHD symptoms, but considering the side effects, overall I am more satisfied with the Focalin.  My son states he likes the Focalin 20 mg the best out of all the other drugs he has tried-Straterra, Concerta 54 mg and Vyvance 10 mg.  There was often a noticeable irritable time in the evenings when the medicine was wearing off.

He was hitting, pinching, spitting, not minding, disrupting class, etc.  After several sessions with a counselor, we decided that medication was necessary.  He started on Focalin XR in December and has shown great improvement. He is on 5mg, once a day.  As for side effects, he lost one pound the first month, but gained two the second.  He has no trouble going to sleep, or any other side effects.  However, we are now into month 3 and I truly believe we need to up the dosage.  The last couple of days he has had had outbreaks of bad behavior, not at school, but at home.  He is rebellious, sassy, and sometimes mean.  The Focalin is supposed to be an 8-10 hour relief, but when it wears off, we all know it.  Sometimes, it happens after he has had the meds, but these ""fits"" usually only last about 10 minutes and then he is fine.  Has anyone else had this problem?"

He is performing much better at school, making all A's.  However, there are a few side affects that we have noticed that aren't listed on the drug info sheet.  Such as, moodiness and constipation.  He eats and sleeps well, has not lost any weight so far.  However, he does have to take Miralax daily for constipation.  Hoping the moodiness wears off when he becomes adjusted to the medication.  He is currently taking 10 mg each morning.

He is doing great on it.  We decided to switch him from Strattera because of his not eating.  He is a very small 8 yr old, about 45 pounds.  Since switching to Focalin XR, I can't seem to keep enough food in the house.  Very excited about this drug not giving him the side effects that all the others had.  This med also does not seem to cause the sleepiness that the others do.  He has put on about 5 pounds since starting this med.  Hopefully it will continue to work.  Also not having the problems with aggression like the other meds seem to give him.

Started with 5mg now on 10mg.  Is doing much better, not acting up in class as much, when she gets upset , she is much easier to calm down. Is much more focused on things she is doing, She  can not swollow the pills, so we open them and sprinkle over a spoon full of chocolate pudding. At first we even had a problem getting her to take that, but I made a game out of it, I bet her she couldn't take it before I counted to 10, it was gone before i even got to 2, quick drink of water after and  we are good to go. It was causing some appitate loss, so we give it to her after she eats breakfest, works great.  Good Luck

He has ADHD that seriously hampered his learning.  Before we decided to put him on this medication he was failing 1st grade and had to be put on an IEP (Individialived Evaluation Plan) where they found he had a learning disablity due to behavior and attention problems.  Now he is performing at above grade average and is no longer considered to have a learning disability.  I do not want to be a cheerleading mother for this drug, I myself wonder everyday if I am doing the right thing for my son long term.  But the short term does not lie and he could definitely not have the success he is having without the medication.  He tells me this as well.  He knows when the medicine wears off, which is about 4:30pm.  So far he is confident in his ability to control himself at school to learn, and is working on peer relations.  My son could not tolerate concerta or adderall.  They made him mean and aggressive.  So I guess as far as it goes, which is for the last 2 years, this medication works very well in treating my sons ADHD.
