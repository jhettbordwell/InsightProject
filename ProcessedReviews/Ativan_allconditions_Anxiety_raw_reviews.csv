Use it for calming brain down so I can sleep, or when Iâ??m nervous about something. Donâ??t use very often because very hard to get from Dr. so I have to limit my usage. But if it was up to me and easier to get Iâ??d take 1 pill every day. Sure takes the edge off .

Do not stay on this drug for more than a month!!  I was unfortunate that I had a really stupid, ignorant family doctor (Dr. THOMAS LUNDSTEN, ST. PAUL, MN, now retired) that just kept refilling my Rx and kept upping the daily dosage I was to take for nearly 3 years!!  I wanted to die so bad, and I almost succeeded.  But I have the aftereffects: brain damage, fibromyalgia, headaches, cfs, etc. from the doctors stupidity.  If you know anyone on this drug, PLEASE WARN THEM TO GET OFF OF IT!!!

It was taken in combination with Welbutrin for depression. Do not take these two together..the ativan made him have body tremors, nervousness, and horrible suicidal thoughts. Do not take Ativan and you become addicted within one month. He was taking it for three months and couldn't handle life anymore.

I took two 1mg pills about 1 hour apart and tolerated the MRI perfectly.  However, I slept the rest of the day and all night!

It has worked better than any of the 9 or 12 they've me in over many, many years. I've been on threes time for 15  years, with no problems stopping when I need to for surgery etc. Lately there's a new black box warning out about this and oxys, but I've been taking them together for years now with no problem... sooooooooo, now my doctor says she can't give them to me anymore so I'm off them for two weeks, and in that time I've slept 2 nights through. I'm on tomazepam which doesn't work much at all. For insomnia, HA!! I've cut way back on the oxys so I can get the ativan back... it's the only drug for me to help with anxiety

16$Anxious$1/31/2017 9:43:13 AM$Reviewer: Polinda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$An excellent medication, out of all meds I tried none were as effective for managing my PTSD symptoms. Completely prevented flashbacks and nightmares and anxiety at night and allowed me to fall asleep very calmly. However I can't give it a 10 because I gained tolerance to the doses incredibly quickly, meaning I had to keep raising the dose to get the same effect, which is dangerous because it is a drug you can become physically addicted to. I would highly recommend this med to those seeking a short term fix while they are becoming stable on another long term med, but would not recommend it as a long term fix due to tolerance and addiction possibilities. I bought Ativan here https://drugstoresale24hss.com/ativan. Maybe my review helpes somebody! 
17$Anxious$1/24/2017 9:34:51 PM$Reviewer: NunYa, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$Worked great at first.  Then my behavior got erratic (like flooring my car to 70 mph in 25 mph zones for no reason).  Started getting irritable and shaky between doses.  Realized I had gotten hooked off 1 mg, 3 times a day for a month and half.  Tried to get off it and doctors were next to useless.  Went to ER with full-blown convulsions/muscle spasms and doctor told me it was the worst case of withdrawal he had seen in 14 years, and that I would die of a heart attack, relapse and start taking it again, or become an alcoholic.  6 years later I'm still alive, drink once or twice a week, and haven't taken any benzos since the day after my ER visit.  Be safe about it, but don't listen to doctors who tell you that you have to keep taking it forever, find one who will help taper you off.  Be strong, you CAN do it, and you'll be better off for it.

This past Saturday I had to take her to the ER because she was having thoughts of ending her life.

BUt i forced myself off it.. i am fine nowadays due to knowing what the problem is and through sheer will i fight it.. its almost gone now.. i go to places that makes me panic , but due to the will to survive and after 3 or 4 times the panics are gone when i go to the same places..  For me it is understanding oneself and how to go about healing.. there are many ways for anyone.

26$Anxious$1/19/2016 12:15:43 PM$Reviewer: Syke, 65-74 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$1$5$"I have been taking Ativan (from 1mg. to 2mg.) every night for 11 years for anxiety and chronic insomnia. It worked great -- but after about 9 years, it seemed to ""turn"" on me. I began waking up with killer headaches and experienced fogginess and abdominal symptoms. The symptoms became incapacitating, and now am attempting to slowing taper off of Ativan -- which I KNOW is the culprit, whether doctors believe it is or not. The withdrawal process is very difficult with the physical symptoms and the psychological fear, especially without much support."
29$Anxious$11/17/2015 9:40:28 AM$Reviewer: libflynn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was first given this in the hospital after having a seizure. I have used it off and on since to treat anxiety and depression. I have to say it is a life saver. I would not recommend more than one dose daily. In my experience it sent me into a fit of rage that I never experienced. It was a terrible side effect, but I would never give up this medication. It calms me and helps me sleep when my mind won't shut off. I helped me thru extremely terrible times.
30$Anxious$11/15/2015 7:03:12 PM$Reviewer: JoeC, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years$5$3$5$This drug works like a miracle to calm my anxiety when needed. Within an hour I can go from a state of near paranoia to total relaxation and ease with the world around me, a temporary transformation to an extrovert even. But it is highly addictive and use must be strictly regulated. It's so easy to want to use it again and again: I try not to use it more than once a week. The problem is that if I slip and start using for a couple days in a row I become dependent and need more to make it work. By the time I've realized I'm hooked and stop the side affects kick in: even worse anxiety than before, trouble sleeping, no energy, no motivation. Overall an excellent medication but must be used with discipline.

I went from being so nervous and shaking to not caring if I was wearing a lampshade on my head in the span of 20 minutes!! 

Afterward, was given .5mg up to 3x daily. This drug has calmed my panic attacks but, it comes at a price... It now takes more to get the same calming effect than in the beginning AND it does tend to make me forgetful. 

Therefore, I only take it when it's absolutely necessary to ward off a panic attack. "
35$Anxious$7/27/2015 4:25:02 PM$Reviewer: Bpwilly , 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$1$This medication is poison. I have been put on it and can't get off.

36$Anxious$7/17/2015 7:26:38 PM$Reviewer: Lavender rrr, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I've been taking generic Ativan as needed for a little over a year, it's usually effective in calming my anxiety and helping me sleep or relax, it also seems to help with muscle tension and soreness. I recently switched to the sublingual tablets because I found waiting a half hour for it to kick in was often really unpleasant. The downside of that is now I have tiny tiny tiny 1mg tablets, I'd usually break my 1mg tablets in half, but it's hard to do with these ones even with my tiny elf hands, and they're really easy to lose. I'm not sure if they last quite as long as the non-sublingual tablets, but they kick in much faster, usually only a few minutes.   I find the side effects vary from day to day,  occasional dizziness or unsteadiness, occasional mild hallucinations if I take more than 1mg at once, sometimes a really high sex drive, sometimes a really sad weird nostalgic feeling. It seems to increase the effects of alcohol, which sounds desirable but is almost always accompanied by extreme drowsiness. Also I think it might be making my hair fall out, but theres a lot of factors that could be contributing to that.

39$Anxious$6/23/2015 1:25:06 AM$Reviewer: ojitos, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was diagnosed with high anxiety. I would wake up in the morning ready to conquer the world ten times over. I would so fast that my family would tell me to calm down. Sometimes I couldn't keep up with myself. I was prescribed 0.5 mg Ativan 2x per day As Needed. This medication is not meant to be taken every single day. Even at the speed I was going, I did not need this medicine every day. If you find you need to take this medication every day, then you should ask for another medication. I was told by my doctor that Wellbutrin helps with anxiety but also with appetite control. The only issue was I would have had to wait 4-6 weeks for it to kick in. We should always police ourselves and watch what we are putting in our mouths and how often, especially medication. Several doctors did not feel comfortable prescribing this drug and I didn't understand why when it was on the formulary at my doctor's office. This is truly the only medication that I found that doesn't cause libido issues and that I can take when needed, not every single day. Most medications made me feel out of my element and thus not myself. The Ativan takes the edge off but helps slow me down so I am not going 100 mph. If you feel like you are starting to become addicted or are addicted, seek help. Don't put yourself in that situation. Be true to yourself. Always!
40$Anxious$6/21/2015 6:14:16 PM$Reviewer: Steph, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$1$5$Ativan worked very well for me in regards to my sleep anxiety. I would take it occasionally when i had troubles sleeping and would get all worried about it. On average, I was probably taking about 2-3 mg a week. Unfortunately, after about 8 months I started developing horrible headaches, insomnia, memory loss and fatigue. I felt shitty all day long and my symptoms would only clear up if I stopped taking Ativan for about a week. If I took even 1 mg again, the symptoms would all come back. DO NOT TAKE Ativan if you are young (I'm 22) ! Psychological help (counselors, therapists etc.) are much more helpful in the long run and they don't mess up your body the way that so many prescription drugs can! If you are thinking of taking Ativan, I would highly recommend you not doing so if you are young and psychotherapy is an option.

It was so intense and it continued for several days. It was so intense my wife took me to the ER. She thought I might be having a heart attack. Could catch my breath, could barely walk, had to be rolled into the ER by a couple of paramedics. They kept me overnight. Set up a heart cath, and put me on Lipitor and Ativan. Went back to work the next day after my release. The attacks never went away. One day at work I had a major anxiety ... major. I turned to my boss and said I can't do this anymore and resigned on the spot. I worked for USPS. Pay around $60 thousand plus. I have a wife and a 10 year old. boy. My postmaster put me down as retiring and I thank her for that. I'm still waiting for HR to complete my retirement package. I applied for Social Security and got it ... I'm 63. The attacks are still there. I also suffer from MDD, ADHD, and deal with insomnia frequently. I walked away from a really good job. I have never been that irresponsible in my life. I've jepardized my families well-being. I very seldom go out ... Only when I  absolutly have to. My depression has gotten worse. Ativan helps a little, but that's all. I still cannot believe I walked away from a great job. Unbelievable ... really."
50$Anxious$12/13/2014 5:27:51 PM$Reviewer: linsalato, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$I have been on 2mg twice a day for 9 years. it works great for anxiety and insomnia, however I feel like I am a slave to this drug because I cannot sleep at all without it. I usually have refills on this script, but when I'm out of refills, my doctor takes forever to contact the pharmacy. I did not sleep more than a couple miserable hours every other night for 6 days. Other than that, I highly recommend this medication over xanax and valium. It lasts for 8 hours, as opposed to the 3 hours of valium, and xanax just seems to get you high and is highly addictive. Long term use of Ativan does cause memory loss and is physically addictive. Restless body syndrome is another withdrawal symptom.  I think I will be on this medication the rest of my life, along with Oxycodone, Gabapentin, Meloxicam and Roboxin. The best advice is don't even start taking any benzodiazepine at all. There's gotta be a better way to deal with anxiety.

I try to keep a little on hand at all times. I was given some during my chemotherapy treatments.  That was the only time I experienced a side effect but I did not realize it immediately. That is, although I acted perfectly normal, when I woke up the next day, I could not remember anything that occurred after the treatment started!  I found out about it in a funny way. Before a treatment, I went in to a store with the friend who brought me. We agreed to return after the treatment.  Apparently we did and I considered making a significant purchase.  My friend convinced me to think it over until the next day.  She then called to see if I decided to buy the ring.  I had no recollection of the second visit nor my possible purchase.  I did several tests after that with the same results - no recollection of anything I did or said for the rest of the day after a chemo treatment.  A nurse advised that it was the ativan.

61$Anxious$9/16/2014 3:50:18 AM$Reviewer: Naples Sunshine, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I find Ativan marvelous. I have severe anxiety disorder which interferes with my work and school. After 2.5 years of not drinking I went back to it as a quick fix for the anxiety. Years earlier they knew I had anxiety but tried to put me on anti-depressants.  A therapist during a hospital stay for alcoholism evaluated me along with my PCP and they said I'm not depressed, just anxious and think Ativan which I was receiving for withdraw would be best for me. I went from 1 mg 3x a day to 1 in the A.M, 1 in the P.M and 2 b4 bed. As of today I'm at 2 in the A.M, 1 in the P.M and 2 b4 bed.  So far it's been working very well, I'm less agitated.  In the hospital they paired it with Valium and may do so again or with Klonopin was talked about.  Ativan helps me sleep, calm down, I have a highly stressful job in finance. I wake up after the 2 feeling tired, a little, but it wears off pretty soon after awaking.  Good medicine!

95$Anxious$9/13/2013 12:30:58 AM$Reviewer: Alphanubilus, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$4$Like any red blooded American, as soon as I was prescribed this drug, I immediately googled it on the web and saw countless horror stories. I read about all the terrible things that happened to people while on Ativan, and to be honest I haven't had any of the problems people say it caused. Back in Aug I was diagnosed GAD and my doctor prescribed to me Ativan .5mg to help cope with my anxiety. I started out at 2mg per day for the first week, but then felt good enough to drop that to 1.5mg and then to just 1mg by week three. By week 4 I was down to .5mg only at night, which is where I'm at right now. I'll be dropping it down to .3 by the end of next week. Ativan has been the ONLY anxiety drug I've taken lately that hasn't tried to kill me. Celexa even at a small dosage gave me the early symptoms of serotonin syndrome. Buspar made me incredibly ill, but my .5 Ativan helps me sleep in a pinch. I'm not keen on staying on this benzo, however if I need to, I think I'll move to Klonopin. In the end my experience has been more than pleasant, and as I'm gradually tapering off the drug, I haven't had really any nasty side effects. As my doctor told me, most of the horror stories are caused by people who didn't follow instructions. Didn't take the drug as prescribed, and or expected the drug to resolve the anxiety issues. As my doc says, the drug helps you do 25% of the work, but it's up to you to resolve the rest of the 75%. This drug isn't for everybody, especially those with drug addiction issues, but if you take it just as the doctor instructs and go in with the mindset to taper yourself off, then I highly recommend it (at least for a short period of time (no more than three months)

It defiantly helps calm me down at a higher dose (4-6mg) and helps me sleep at a lower dose (1-2mg). The only trouble I have is finding a doctor that will continue to prescribe it to me. I've heard it can be very addictive but I stopped taking it for a few months and felt no withdrawal, just anxious and tired (obviously). Overall I love Ativan. I've been taking it for about one year now and will continue to take it to help with my anxiety.

When she has overwhelming anxiety she takes one pill.  If she feels ok she will skip a day.  It takes 20-25 minutes to take effect and this low dosage returns her to normal.  It is very consistent as to when it kicks in.  This gives her a minimum of 4 hours of relief.  The effect appears to go away after 4 hours but because she broken the cycle of her anxiety she may be better the rest of the day.  The reason for the low dosage, taking only when she needs it and only once a day is a fear of addiction.

Your tolerance builds significantly faster than opiates if you up your dosage or take more than recomended.

They tried me on other medications but they always made me feel loopey.  My life was destroyed by my mental illness but when they put me on ativan the tension, heaviness in my heart, the shaking and feeling like my life was over all went away.  I was back to being myself again and have ever since.  Sure I have some bad days but don't we all.  Just to live normal again and not have the fear in your heart or in your head is worth it to me.  You need to take your meds as prescribed and don't increase the meds or drink alcohol with them.  I have been blessed they finally did find something to help me live a more normal life.  All meds work differently on people so just work with your doctor and what works for you to be a normal person again is what it's all about.

So far, the generic lorazepam has worked well with no noticeable side effects. Almost immediate relief from an impending panic attack is achieved. 

However, many of the reviews of this medication are alarming.  I am concerned that the drug may be responsible for many of the difficult to read cryptic posts.

It's great for a quick panic attack of if you need to be in a crowd of people. It doesn't get you 'high' unless you abuse if profusely. Just beware if you do choose to overdo this drug. It is capable of competely stopping your heard rate because your body becomes so relaxed. Only take as prescribed. Even as prscribed you will get the same effect, just at a slower pace. 

I have been on Ativan for about 4 months now an it helps quite a lot when i need to meet new people. I almost fear ""Fearless"". I will just walk up to someone and introduce myself  and strike up a conversation. 

In a work environment you become more productive. You no longer feel like you are 'dragging ass' the entire day just waiting for it to be over. 

Only think i worry about is dependance. Get yourself  good support system. Family is the best since they know you more. I also have my Doctor and therapist to keep an eye on me. I suggest many of you can do the same if possible. 

I watched my brother start out on Xanax, and now he's a cocaine head, meth addict, crack addict, and will do anything to feel high. **BEWARE** "

I first was prescribed klonapin, but it made me to groggy.So I was prescribed Ativan,and have been taking 2mg a day for 2 years now,and the anxiety is much less,and have a better quality of life,and it doesn't cause any side effects. I feel more level headed,and make better life for myself. I would recomend this for anyone who has true anxiety disorder as it has helped me.

I started taking 0.5 mg 3Xs a day after being kidnapped, beaten and threatened to be shot. I was diagnosed with PTSD.  This medication helped me get my life back together.  I too did not feel that I was addicted, until my new doctor advised me to stop taking it. He felt that at age 64 the medication would continue to cause problems with my balance and would end up causing additional problems. It would be easier to get off of it now than later.  Even though he has been taking me off slowly, I have had really bad side effects.  Believe me, this is an addictive drug!  While it helped me deal with my problems initially, it also caused me problems.  I do have issues with my balance and took a nasty fall (for no apparent reason)a few years ago. My doctor says it is alcohol in pill form.

tried to stop cold turkey. for 4 days I was 
absolutely miserable - experiencing most of the withdrawal side effects. I restarted the 
ativan to stop the side effects. Also, if
I only take one mg. at bedtime to help me sleep - I have withdrawal reactions the very next afternoon - especially terrible needles and pins in arms and legs. I have near taken a drug in which you begin withdrawal reactions within a 24 hour period - how strong and such a short lifespan for a drug."

270$Anxious$2/11/2011 2:03:50 PM$Reviewer: GodLovesU, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$A few weeks ago, I was in the ER having a panic attack, and I was having trouble breathing and I had really bad akathisia which means that I couldn't stop moving. I had been suffering from the akathisia for about a year. Right after I started taking Ativan I had no more breathing problems and my Akathisia stopped!  This drug along with my faith in God, and my family and friends helps me a lot with feeling inner peace and helps me with my restlessness. So to anyone experiencing trouble breathing during a panic attack or akathisia for any reason, I would highly reccommend Ativan.  Good luck to all of you and God Bless

I was struggeling with Chronically severe anxiety (Always thinking I was about to die do to my heart, and other many many Illogical fears) And tried an assortment of medications that did almost nothing.

2MG of this pill (2MG for my weight - 185) worked amazing.

It does Indeed calm you down, but not that ""I'm high"" feeling or ""I'm so tired I just want to sleep"" feeling.

This medicine made me feel ""normal"" for once. Though getting this medicine may be extremely hard to do, you might be extremely happy that you tried.

If you're taking any of the Benzo's (Klonpopin, Xanax, Buspar ect) then this medication should never cause you to withdrawl.

However, It can become ""mentally abused"" by which It's you new ""Emergency medicine"" and if you run out, why you may not be withdrawing being out can easily send you into a massive chain of panic attacks.

Please ween yourself off of this medicine as It produced visions, night tremors ect for myself.

Please do not abuse It either as It directly effects the brain, be careful.


The normal dose Is 1MG 2x a day.

Some people MIGHT take 1MG 3x a day.

Some people MIGHT take 2MG 1x a day, or, 2x a day If they can handle It (Tollerance)



Taking this medicine for myself Has prooven to remove 100% of my anxiety and fear for about 1 hour, or so. Extremely effectly In my opinion and is very affordable."

My doc prescribed Ativan (.5mg up to 4x a day) right away, along with Zoloft. It's been one year, and although I do have mini attacks now and again, I am in control - I take .5mg and within minutes I am better. I have never actually taken the full 2mg a day.

My doctor gave me a prescriptian of Ativan. Told me to try it at home to see how I react to it prior to taking it at work with an attack and to only take it with an attack. Tried it for 3 days. Every time with in 45 minutes of taking it I was passed out, unable to function there is no possible way I could take this at work. My doctor switched my med to Xanax, so far it is helping with out knocking me out.

Before that I used Librium for panic disorder but eventually stopped using it with the instant result of insomnia.  After a few years of insomnia I tried many medications to help and finally came across Ativan which instantly helped.  I have used Ativan ever since and occasionally use during the day when feeling extreme anxious.  I feel I will have to use this for the rest of my life.  I am now 69 years old.  Started using Librium at 21.

This is a med you have to use daily not as a prn. Xanax is better for prn use since it hits harder than Ativan. Ativan does work with my extreme anxiety, but not so much with my panic attacks. Xanax works better for that. I haven't experience any complications and i've been on it (1mg ativan) for 3 months now :]

Took .5mg a day for about 1 month and really helped me with my anxiety.  I actually wanted to get out of the house and do things, which I never could do before.  But after about 3 weeks of taking it I developed an irregular heartbeat.  The doctors say that the Ativan is not related to the palps but I never had anything wrong with my heart before I started taking the Ativan.  Now on a beta blocker to calm down the irregular heartbeats but that is a whole different story.

I am a simple person, living a simple life, I work full time and I am having problems just paying my bills,  I could not exist without this drug. I don;t drink because I worry about my liver. I take this medicine occasionally, no more than two at a time, and not every day.  I find that I can drive if necessary  and it calms me when my patience is wearing thin. It keeps me from crying, as I can't tolerate most antidepressants. This drug is my saving grace!!! I highly recommend it to anyone, in moderation!   5 stars for sure!!! and the  generic is cheap!!!

I rely on a mail-order service for my prescriptions & my Ativan refill was ""lost in the mail"" for a week.  During the dreadful cold turkey stage I gradually got numb & trembling extremities and trembling lower jaw.  I was convinced I had Lou Gehrigs Disease; I was convinced that if I got in my car to go to the ER I would get in an accident & die also.  Finally called a friend to take me to ER where they gave me a shot of Ativan & a temporary supply to last until my refill arrived.  It doesn't help my anxiety at all but I can't stop taking it due to the horrible withdrawl side effects.  "

387$Anxious$3/30/2010 4:12:04 AM$Reviewer:  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more$5$5$5$"I have been on Lorezapam (generic for Ativan) for about 12 years now. I have stopped taking it for periods of time (up to 3 months or more), but only wound up having acute panic attacks again and often hospitalized since some of my symtoms were considered life threatning. It is the only medication that has been able to prevent me from having acute anxiety attacks and some other health problems especially hypertension(the silent killer). The reason I would stop taking it was because of all the ""BS"" I heard about how harmful it could be and was very addictive and you would have to take more and more of it, not so with me!  I take 1 mg twice daily and it does the trick, I am able to function totally normal while taking this medication with NO SIDE EFFECTS!
I have been told by Doctor's that the 1 mg dose I take twice a day is considered a small dose and is not harmful to me and actually benefical for me to take because of the other health problems I have. Sometimes I will only take 1 MG daily and have NEVER taken more than 3 MG in one day.
From my personal experience with this medication, I would rank it right at the top if you need treatment for acute anxiety.
As for the treatment of anxiety before I started taking Lorezapam, THEY ALL FAILED!
Yes, I understand this is not the case for others, if you have suceeded my some other method, GREAT! But if you are going to need medication, myself I don't know of anything better. Doctor's have tried me on everthing else from just plain Aspirin and a night of good sex to Thorazine.

392$Anxious$3/27/2010 9:06:38 AM$Reviewer: Bob, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I originally started on this medication back in 1985 when it was given to me for panic attacks - I tried several other drugs before ativan (including the various anti depressant drugs, all of which did nothing except produce terrible side effects) and none of them worked - ativan worked immediately and I have been on it ever since - at one point, I was taking 6mgs per day and am now on a regular dose of 1mg. I have to laugh at all the medical experts who warn against long term use of ativan (and similar medications) suggesting patients will require larger and larger doses for effect when the exact opposite has been the case for me - the only side effect I experience is the relief of anxiety. I am now in excellent health, do not suffer from panic attacks nor any anxiety beyond the usual day to day stress, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this medication to anyone given my experience. I would rate it a class A medication in all respects!

It started with the left side of my chest becoming numb, then gradually got worse. Not knowing what to do I called my brother and he didn't answer. At this time I was still able to control my body and breathing. Trying to sit down and calm myself is the only thing I could think of. Then the pain kicked in. It literally felt like someone was holding a blow torch to my heart. I started the hyperventilate and my muscles tensed. I was scared, I thought that if I closed my eyes I was going to die. My sister in law took me to the hospital where upon arrival they took my vitals. Heart rate, 196, blood pressure, 140/90, neither one was good. They gave me a shot of liquid Ativan which calmed me down and took the pain away. When I went home I tried to sit down on the couch. As I stared in the distance the house came alive. Chairs were moving, chandelier talking, baby stroller walking. None of them were scary, but it was very weird. After doing some research I found out that haluccinations aren't on the side effect lest for Ativan. Can someone please help me to understand why my halluccinations occured?

I take .5mg 4x a day and dont always do this.  Its good to have the flexibility to take when needed and take one or two depending on severity.  I find less instances of anxiety and sleep is much better.  I did have my first real panic attack recently and chewing up 2 .5mg tablets calmed my heart rate down enough to get through the attack without making that expensive trip to the ER.  If you are only having mild to moderate anxiety this is a good one to try.  Like it a lot better than the SSRIs such as lexapro.

It was like Santa and Jesus worked at a drug co. and made a wonder pill. My anxiety was gone. 1mg 3times aday, right off the bat. Things were great until you run out. This stuff will hook you fast and hard. You will tell yourself it is worth it, and it is, for a while. Had to move, new psych, got me off slowly.

I didn't take it every day and thought I was doing ok. One day at work I became very angry and thought I should try taking it daily instead of as needed. Boy, was it a life saver. My doctor agrees. I take 1 mg twice daily and I feel normal for the first time in my life. I can go outside, get on a bus, shop, etc. and not have to think about it for a while first. I just jump in the car (or bus) and go. It's wonderful having such a ""normal"" life. Before, other drugs like Paxil or Zoloft made things worse for me. I felt suicidal at times so I stopped them."
455$Anxious$12/12/2009 8:06:56 PM$Reviewer: holmar, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$First of all, I noticed that no matter what, when you comment on this, it starts with the anxiety section, so I said it was anxiety.  This drug is a nightmare yet a wonder drug at the same time.  I started taking it because I have multiple sclerosis and had muscle spasms.  That was 6 years ago.  I NEVER had anxiety before then.  It worked for the muscle spasms when nothing else would.  I tried neurontin (hallucinated), as well as all the muscle relaxants which just didn't touch it.  I knew this was a scary drug because my mother was a counselor and the doctor switched her from ativan (lorazepam) to ambien.  She began going through severe withdrawals.  She hallucinated, shook and had seizures.  They thought she was psychotic (she was and I tried to tell them why but they wouldn't listen), they put her on the psychiatric ward and gave her haldol.  Then she began to twitch and couldn't walk, half her face hung down (tardive dyskinesia).  They were ready to put her in a mental institution.  I begged them to listen to me, and even tried to sneak in ativan but I got caught.  She almost died before they gave her ativan.  Then she was back to normal.  It was truly a nightmare.  She had to move her practice to a different town.  She was so humiliated.  So, when I started taking it 6 years ago for my back, I was really careful.  Since then, and now I only take .5 to 1 mg at bedtime.  I went on a trip and forgot it.  I thought I would be fine.  By day 2 it was me this time.  I couldn't think, I was having horrible anxiety, and was scared out of my mind.  I drank a beer (I heard that helps a little), and it did some, but not enough. Finally I got the ativan and I got better.  Turns out, it doesn't matter how little you take, it's how long you take it.  Yes, it works wonders, but make sure you never run out, and if you start to have anxiety before your next dose, remember, it CAUSES anxiety too.  Just be very careful.  Dont take too much and let yourself run out.  Itcanbefatal

Finally, when the SRIs came out, I started Prozac, and found it help my overall mood, but, it had no effect on the sometimes debilitating worried feelings I've felt since child hood. After my divorce,I had a total mental collapse, with all of the terrifying and overwhelming physical and irrational mind trauma that accompanies a classic ""panic attack"". My Psych/Doc said at first to rest a few days and the total withdrawal from daily hassles and stresses, might make this terrifying event subside, or stop altogether. It did not!!!  I was soon diagnosed with Gen. Anxiety Disorder(at age 27, now 38), and have been on ativan and prozac since. I'm no fool, and i know I am 100% dependent on this med. But The worst thing about this med is that it works. And it works so well on my condition that I am prepared to take it until either a magic psychiatrist casts a spell or waves a wand that stops these feelings, or it's time for my ""dirt nap"". I am 6'1"" and 245 and have slowly built a tolerance. I now take prozac 40mg in the AM, and 1mg ativan twice daily, and 1 take a 2mg ativan in the AM.

Lately I've been having dizzy spells and reduced vision so I have been taking the ativan to help, but I'm concerned if the symptoms are anxiety related or withdrawl related. I was a fairly heavy drinker for the last year or so. Now I'm in a ""catch 22"" situation. Alcohol withdrawl? Ativan withdrawl? Or anxiety symptoms. Wow, that went off track. All in all I feel the drug is great for anxiety but WILL cause issues when mixed with alcohol. Hey I thought of a side effect that I haven't read yet.

I was on 4+mgs a day for 4 years and I have recently stopped taking it.  When you stop taking this drug ( and one day you will have to) the anxiety is HORRIBLE, your whole body hurts, you cant sleep, eat, function.  It will be WAY worse than any panic attack you have ever had.  I PROMISE you that you need to find other ways to control anxiety.  Benzos will ruin you.  Dr's cant treat a panic disorder when you are blocking the problem with this terrible drug.  If you decide to get off ativan there is a manuel called "" Ashtons manuel.  PLEASE follow this, it will help with WD symptoms.  Getting off this drug is the best thing I ever did, taking it was the worst.  It is NOT helping you.  OH did i mention seizures can be part of WD.  If you dont believe any of this I dare you to stop taking the drug and see how you feel.  I will tell you.....stomach pains ( nauseous) legs will cramp, PANIC ATTACKS, and utter misery.  Get out now while you still can.  Dont be scared.  Try googling a benzo support forum....you wont be alone and trust me it helps.  Detox centers are not prepared for Benzo withdrawl.  Good luck, and if you stay on this drug then your just damning yourself for the inevitable.  Your dose will get to high or your DR will stop writing the Rx.  "

Anyone that is using it now -beware.  I was an ativan user for 4yrs. It was a nightmare. Of course it worked in the beginning, but after awhile it stopped working.  I started with xanax then went to klonipin then ativan. What a mistake. For extreme anxiety it started to work. The md had to continue to increase the dose so I would still get the relief -- or high!  He wanted to increase it to 8mgs but I said no and decided to get off the drug.  It was slowly killing me. Er visits started to increase. I started having a lot of stomach pains, chest pains, and leg pains. Most important was that I felt like a zombie all the time. I wasn't leaving the house and  sunshine bothered my eyes. I just couldn't function outside of the home. I finally had the courage to take control of my own life and decided to admit myself to a hospital detox unit. You cannot do this yourself. I tried. I've been off ativan for 2 1/2 years and I'm doing much better. My NEW md has me on lamical. I'm taking vacations, moved into a new house, gardening, put in a pool. I'm not totally free of the withdrawal yet but I'm still hanging in there and enjoying life. Exercise does help and I've joined two classes. Hint- walking outside helps a lot, drink plenty of water(helps with anxiety) breathing & relaxation music is a must. Remember- ativan is very addicting. My diagnosis was that it was slowing killing me. I DO STRUGGLE EVERYDAY BUT NOW I'M IN CONTROL NOT THE ATIVAN--IT DID IT'S DAMAGE ON ME. Ativan puts a block in your brain so you don't feel the anxiety which makes you feel like you are in a waking coma. If I can help at least one person by my experience then it was worth it. Please don't use ativan -it slowly kills.

Severe panic attacks and agoraphobia.  This is the only medication that has worked and not caused me to feel ""addicted""  I started with xanax, which made me anxious if I didnt take it at a specific time, and kind of bitchy too.  Did the klonapin thing, too groggy.  Ativan works just right.  I started out with 2mg 3x a day, and am now down to 1mg 2 or 3x a day,  if I'm just chillin at home, just 1mg is effective of keeping ""el diablo"" (panic attacks) away.  I feel that the abuse of this drug would only be by someone that doesnt have panic attacks.  For me having such a high anxiety level, this drug simply takes the edge off and actually allows me to function as a ""normal"" person.   I can go out to dinner, shopping, to a concert, on a vacation.  Not stuck in my house, or an ER anymore.  YAY FOR ATIVAN!!!!"

It also works well for mild to moderate insomnia. I've found that 1/2 of a 0.5 mg dosage is usually effective for me.  Occassionally I will take  a full 0.5 mg dosage.  I keep the dosage and frequency as low as possible to avoid physical dependence, which is a high risk with this medication (more so than many other drugs in the benzodiazepine family).

It stops my panic attacks in their tracks and helps me calm down when I'm unreasonably nervous. I highly recommend Ativan for anxiety, but only if you take it as directed.

However I became tolerant of that dose and was then prescribed 1 mg twice a day. Incredibly addicting, so much so that I felt the need to take 2 or 3 mg just to fall asleep at night. When I wouldn't take one I would have a panic attack.

ALSO: put me to sleep.

Eventually I made sure that I did not have any more remaining refills and basically holed myself up for a week or so, with no possible triggers for a panic attack, and cut it off cold turkey.

Again, can't stress how addictive this pill is."

I did not find any help from SSRI's that much and still had panic attacks.
Xanax and Ativana re the best for emergency.
But both of them are highly addicted. 
I found Ativan to be less addictive than Xanax.
Now, I take Ativan twice a week, 0.5 mg and I am simply fine. If I do not take it than I get panic attacks.
If I get a real bad panic attack, than I take xanax because it wokrs faster. Those are great but should not be used everyday. If you can control your self, I think that those are the best.

I was scared I would be shaking so bad that I wouldn't be able to put my husband's ring on his finger! I took 1.5 mg of Ativan and everything went perfect. Normally I am unable to speak, choke up, feel like running out of the room, or like I'm going to pee my pants! I was so worried about not being able to say my vows, but this drug worked amazingly well! I have tried Xanax, clonipin, paxil, and welbutrin but they didn't help.

The drug is highly addictive and is, along with all benzodiazapines, very difficult to quit. 

Do yourself a favor if you are considering taking this stuff and do a Google search on Ativan withdrawal. Read the results carefully. 
This stuff only works for a while and then you need to updose to avoid interdose withdrawal.

Seems they always want me to try something else. I am comfortable with  the Ativan. If I have to take it the rest of my life, I will feel safe ntaking this medicine, because no other has helped me. I can function properly everyday,and I know Ativan has been around for many years.

631$Anxious$3/30/2009 4:39:45 PM$Reviewer: Nic, 25-34 Male  (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have had anxiety issues for years but they have worsened considerably lately.  I had an anxiety attack so bad a week ago that i went to the e.r and was prescribed a low dose ativan until  could see my regular doctor.  The medicine helped me so much that i cant begin to describe it.  I wasnt able to get in to see my regular pain doctor for the next week or so, and when i did he did not want to prescribe it to me, even after i described how it had opened my eyes and made me realize that i wanted to to stop taking my regular pain meds (methadone, norco)just so that i could have something to make me enjoy life again.  My doctor of course says that he ""hates that medicine"" and it took everything to convince him to at least give me something else for anxity.  So instead he prescribed me very small doses of klonopins.  At first it sounded to me as if they would be similar but to my dissapointment they are not.  Ativans changed the way i was thinking and made me feel very positive about life.  I am now in the process of trying to get my doctor changed so that i may have the option of changing the med.  My advise to anyone out there is to be on top of your case, and dont just let your doctor take advantage of the fact that you dont know as nuch about med. as they do.  Nobody can tell you how much pain you are in. GOOD LUCK"

I had never had an anxiety problem, or sleeplessness issue prior to taking this. It worked for both problems by the second night, and the next 7 months. I was concerned by the second month about becoming dependent on it, but my doctor was not. In hindsight, I would have thrown out what was left, gone to a counselor, and asked for Lunesta. As it was, I could not conduct a normal day without that pill, and spent several unbelievably hellish months attempting to ovecome the physical and emotional dependency. I had no experience with any drugs other than pain medications post surgery, so this warning is given to other drug ""virgins,"" in the hope that they will realize several very important things: counselors are expensive and your health and well-being ARE worth spending this money and time on, and, occasionally, a drug is necessary When it is, get the hell off of it as soon as possible. Do not just assume your doctor will call you up and tell you that he's been thinking, and it's time to take you off! In addition, do an Internet search on what other users of Ativan are saying. THEY ARE CORRECT. ALL OF THEM."

At first the wellbutrin was upping my anxiety issues a bit, especially at night. Ativan helped calm me down to be able to fall asleep. Now that I've been on wellbutrin for a while, I rarely need the ativan at all. My only issue with ativan is that it's REALLY strong. I only need a quarter of a pill. Also, I'm afraid to take it during the day. When I take a quarter of a pill at night, I fall asleep within 30 min!

It's difficult trying to dose because some days are better than others and I don't require the max dose. It has helped me with my anxiety, migraines and helps me sleep. Although it does help it is also addictive, just a few hours of a missed dose is painful, my head starts to hurt, my body feels like it is tightened up and I start developing aches and pains, can't sleep. So I recommend to anyone who takes this med to make sure that you always have your scripts refilled before you run out.

723$Anxious$12/5/2008 6:28:57 PM$Reviewer: jacsprat5, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I started using Ativan when I would take a plane ride, .5 didn't help on a plane ride, but 1.0 did.  I have severe PMDD/PMS which is why I currently use Ativan as needed.  Every OBGYN wants to put you on an antidepressant which have terrible side effects, so I just stick with this from my primary doctor so I can just take it when I need it.  The doctor prescribed 1. mg but I break them down to .5 and even .25 depending on how I am feeling.  I am prescribed 90 pills at 1.0 mg. and it lasts me a year or so.  I was nervous at first of getting addicted to it, so it makes me more aware of taking it.  I try not to unless I really have to, although, I think sometimes I should just take .25 around ovulation time to help me get through the depression days before my period.  I think it has been a lifesaver for me with my anxiety and it helps me to sleep well.  I usually just take it at night, but I should probably take .25 during the day when I am ovulating.  Working out also helps a great deal with anxiety and depression.  I have started taking a B-complex vitamin, and that seems to be helping as well.

The effectiveness is more than nothing at all, more than Benadryl, but less effective than the other commonly prescribed sedative or benzodiazepines. I think that rather than calm or sooth the anxiety away, it makes me too stupid to notice some of the things I'd normally notice and possibly feel anxious about. I do like that it lasts longer than others of it's kind, but since it mostly makes me plain old stupid, that can end up a real inconvenience and even an embarrassment. I sometimes get leg cramps or headaches. Also, it seems to give me a cough? I know that may seem way weird, but it does this thing where I get gaggy, and cough a lot.

At first it gave me the feeling of being nauseous as if I was drunk, but I started to eat a little bit with it and that helped. I have since quit taking it, however my doctor is going to start me back on it to help with my IBS. I have to say that I have taken other ""anti-anxiety"" medicines, and this one gave the least amount of haziness, and after taking it for 3 months, I never felt dependant on it. (Even with a history of dependency.) "

It works great for me, just to take the edge off when I feel a panic attack coming on, or when I am extremely anxious, I have been on prozac, klonopin, and much heavier drugs that give me a hang over effect. I can fully function just taking an ativan and getting over being anxious. I have quit taking the other medications and just take the ativan when needed. I don't feel that I am addicted to it as I only need to take it a few times a week.

I was prescribed ativan a year ago when my son needed surgery and the panic attacks became much worse.  I take half the prescribed .5 mg dosage (am taking .25 mg)and it works great for me.  Takes the edge off of the panic attack, and helps me deal with the vertigo.  It's been a life saver.  I only take it a few days a week (or less), and only one 1/2 dosage pill because I'm concerned about the addiction factor, but so far I haven't noticed any issues - could be because I'm taking such a low dosage.  
820$Anxious$7/24/2008 8:34:31 PM$Reviewer: Milo, 45-54 Male  (Patient) $5$5$5$I took this medicine for generalized anxiety disorder for over 10 years -- 4 mg./day. It is excellent at relieving anxiety and giving a general calming effect. When I felt like I was becoming tolerant to it, that it was losing its effect, I would just cut back on the dose for a while, and then everything would be OK. I did have a very strange reaction one time when I had a glass of wine while on Ativan, all out of proportion to what you would expect, so it's best to be careful about drinking while taking this medicine, I suppose. It is also helpful for insomnia.

Xanax is way too strong for me and gives me a hangover effect-not good when you are a caregiver! Ativan has been a godsend for me. I have been taking .25mg-.50mg at bedtime for a year. I don't find it to be addictive at all. it sometimes takes a lot to convince a doctor that you are NOT depressed! I had a BAD experience with Prozac years ago. Some doctors immediateley diagnose depression based on what you tell them.It can sometimes be dangerous to allow your family doctor prescribe phychiatric meds! My psychiatrist gives seminars to groups of GP's outlining the hazards of doing just that. I believe Ativan is safe, well tested, and effective based on my experience. I hate it when doctors just write a script for the newest thing on the market, when there are older, tried-and-true drugs that are cheaper.

I started taking 4 pills during the day but I have been able to reduce the amount to 2 pills a day unless I have to go some where in a crowd or previous panic attack situation.  Then, I take a pill before going which prevents an attack. It took 6 long months to diagnois my panic attacks but 2 weeks after starting
ativan I was able to return to stores that I had experienced attacks in before.  I was almost totally house bound because of the dread of having an attack in public.

After 7 days off the med,I am now able to remember a couple hours out of my day. This is very scary and I suggest before anyone goes on it for long term you read the fine print that Wyeth has. It is common for this reaction in 10% of the prescribed people and in doses of 4mg or more daily. I was not on 4mg, so beware. It also takes 7-20 days for memory to return to normal.

I am concerned about becoming addicted so my doctor suggested, weening myself off of it, by taking it every other night for a week, then every two nights for a week and so forth.  He has also suggested I see a Phsycologist, which I do on a regular basis, excercise, and relaxing techniques, such as meditation, massage, accupuncture and Yoga.  I am going to try the accupuncture first, then the excercise and then the Yoga.  I will report later.  It was great reading all the reviews, I hope that my review will help someone deal with their anxiety and try the things my doctor has suggested.

However I could only take half a dose because it made me very tired and forgettful, I would slur my speech like I was drunk, but my panic attacks were gone! Too bad it is not a long term drug.

I have been on those meds for over 13 months now. My dr. prescribed Lorazepam 1 mg. every four hours to help wiht the intense withdrawal pains that I am experiencing. It is one of the most painful things my body had ever had to go through, and I have had 5 children. The antivan is much more helpful than not. If I didn't have it I do not know where I would be. My anxiety/panic attacks are too numerous to count. My legs are so achey and can barely walk. There is NO relief for that, is there? My heart races like it is going 400mpminute. I can not sleep more than 2-3 at a stretch. so I am 
overwhelmingly beside myself. If anyone has any answers to this I would so apprecriacite it. My doctor is tapering me off rather quickly, but not cold turkey, thank God. This all started when I went in for a routine outpatient surgery last Jan. 2007.
Three days later I awoke to my entire left side going numb ( a painful numb). Long story short and a gazillion tests later, it was discovered my discs at C7/T1 were completely damaged somehow, during the surgery. Now I have massive panic attacks and anxiety that is unbearable at time.
Anyway enough out of me.
thank for listenting. would appreciate any imput. "
902$Anxious$2/28/2008 1:44:46 AM$Reviewer: mel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$" Fantastic drug when used in moderation! Not to be used if genetically inclined to be addicted to anything esp. drugs! Started Ativan when I had a ""screamer"" of a boss. Thought I was just a ""Drama Queen"" while venting my opinions. I thought I was verbalizing for everyone who wouldn't. I swore profusely & rationalized it by calling myself jokingly ""Tammy Tourette"" (as in the syndrome.) However, all my co-workers were indeed stressed but did not ""dramatize"" it as I did.  I went to the Doctor. He diagnosed me with borderline high anxiety and prescribed Ativan. It saved me profusely. Took 1mg at that job(waitress at very busy place.) Was fantastic! Realized I am only one person that can only do what I can do. I want to make everyone happy--Really!
Have now used Ativan off & on for 4 years. No side effects (can take at 2a.m. for insomnia & go to Jazzercise @8:30am) & feel wonderful & go to work standing for 8-hours, lifting, walking, people pleasing, all day. Only side effect for me is that it takes away my stressfully induced ""humor"" which everyone knows me for. But it such a relief to take a break! For them & me!
It's so funny that I'm so paranoid about becoming addicted to a high-anxiety drug that works so well for me. Use it when you need it only. Like taking the sleeper airfare to your destination. Or going to Europe when the jet-lag will kill you the first 3-days. Or going on a job interview. This drug works for that!!"

917$Anxious$2/10/2008 8:15:32 PM$Reviewer: bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Ativan is probably the best (perhaps second best behind Xanax) short-acting benzo on the market.  It works wonders for anxiety and other conditions.  Its efficacy is often times demonstrated by the fact that it makes you fall asleep, which is sometimes desired (as opposed to remaining awake and suffering ).  Be careful not to drive after taking this medicine, however, because it has a similar effect on the brain as alcohol (I am not sure of the Chemistry behind that statement, but that is what I have been told by psychiatrists and pharmacists.)  Great short-acting benzo, but highly addictive, so be very careful.  Do not abuse it, and be cautious when coming off of it - make sure you do not precipitously stop taking it b/c there could be serious withdrawal symptoms.  Just be careful with it and it will work wonders (in the short term).  Try Klonopin for a longer acting benzo...

My tolerence kept building and I was taking more and more every couple of days or else it just wouldn't work.  I took Ativan for four months and one day decided to stop because Ativan had been causing headaches.  Don't get me wrong, the headaches were worth the relief from panic attacks, but I figured I was going to try to beat my anxiety without drugs.  I stopped taking Ativan and had no side effects and no withdrawl symptoms.  Also, my panic attacks went away.   All in all, this is a good drug, just don't become dependent on it!!!

Withdrawl symptoms can be evident and unpleasent if I've used my prescription too quickly in a given month.  I take 60 .5mg tablets every thirty days.
     This medicine has wonderful potential to help anxious people  feel comfortable; however, it must be used with descretion.  I have discussed increasing my dose or number of tablets with my doctor, but am concerned with withdrawl symptoms.  Three tablets a day may be better than two, but eventially I'm afraid I would require four and on.

Lorazepam is a godsend in that on days I'm feeling anxious, I take it, and I feel like myself again.  Other days, if I feel good, I don't take it.  The only downside is that about 5 hours after I take it I get pretty drowsy, but it's worth the relief and the ability to be free from anxiety.  My only concern is that I've heard it can be addictive, so I'm always overly fearful of taking it more than a couple of days in a row.

Most recently, I have been able to face bloodwork without being medicated and I feel that it is because I have been able to become ""desensitised"".  I still take the med for IV's.  Having tried several kinds of therapy in my life and even begged to be held down for my marriage blood work to be drawn, I agreed to try anxiety medications.  This is, by far, the best for me.  I take it an hour before the sched ""needle time"" and usually hit the height of the medication's effects at approx. an hour and a half after taking the pills.  
I credit Lorazepam with helping me experience enough blood draws comfortably that I no longer need it for that and hope to reach that point with IV's, too. "

The doctors tell you that, they do not, however, tell you what can happen if you take for a long period of time. I have been taking Lorazepam for 6 years, 1 mg/twice a day. Prior to that I was on Xanax for 10 years.I have now become tolerant and am having withdrawal symptoms. I have done quite a bit of research on this and withdrawal can last years or even decades. This drug needs to be tapered off VERY slowly for a minimum of about 10 months. Some people have terrible withdrawal symptoms for years after stopping this medication. It messes with the Gaba receptors in your brain as well as your central nervous system. Read the Ashton Manual. Doctors keep prescribing these types of drugs because they are getting kickbacks from 'Big Pharma' to do so. Do your research and get off this horrible drug if you have been on for a long time.

I was a little scared of becoming dependant on the drug because of family addiction history but ive been taking it as needed for about 10 months now and im perfectly find and lead a happy normal life on this drug. Side effects tho are a almost high feeling, which i get sometimes but it usually wears off in like an hour, I slur my words sometimes and just act a lttle funky  but my anxiety is so bad that the symptoms override my need for lorazapam.

I'm a combat vet. I was driving down the road one day feeling fine when out of the blue I felt like i was having a heart attack.I stop at a near by fire station and they say all my vitals are fine. better than fine even. after several more of these incidents the VA says i'm having panic attacks. and prescribes me lorazepam as needed. It worked from get go. And it works within minutes for me. it's helped me allot over the last 6-7 years. Anybody with panic attacks that feel like heart attack (all the exact same symptoms of a heart attack)this medication may help you out.

My psychiatrist has had me taking these pills as needed for over a year now.  They come in handy whenever I’m feeling stressed, am about to go in a stressful situation, or feel anxious while trying to switch over depression medications.  It can make me feel calm, though not necessarily happy.  I find that it has less effect if I start taking it too often for too long, but overall it has been a helpful medicine.  I recommend taking it as needed whenever you feel yourself start getting anxious.  Don’t wait until you’re entirely bogged down in anxiety!

Always a racing mind and the feeling of anxiousness all the time making me sick. My first dose was like the miracle drug. Within 30 minutes or so I started to feel much better, in fact I really didn't notice I was feeling better until I thought about it. It brought back my appetite and helps me fall asleep and stay sleeping. My mind is not racing anymore either. My concern is stopping this drug. I've heard nightmare stories about withdrawing off of this drug, if abused. But if you take it for more than 6 months, you're already ""addicted"" to it and WILL get severe withdrawals if you stop suddenly. For now it's working for me, but I know I can't stay on this medication for too long.   "

My doctor started me on this in addition to an anti-depressant, because my anxiety stops me from taking that last step to swim, go out to lunch, have a relaxed, honest conversation with people who are close to me, picking up the phone...you get what I mean, I hope. It is a very low dose- 1mg. up to four times a day. It does seem to quiet the anxiety and if I push myself I can do the things (above) that I would really like to do. However, even this low dose adds to my constant fatigue, which might just be a psychosomatic (?) symptom in the first place, I don't know. What I am trying to say is that this helps me sometimes to get out of myself and do things that make me nervous because I know if I would just do them, I will probably have a lot of fun from the experience.

I have had stressful sleep for years and have a really hard time staying asleep due to anxiety.  I'd rather have 5 hours a night of good sleep vs. 8 hours of stressful sleep.  It's like not sleeping at all.  The doctor said I need to take 1mg at night before bedtime to sleep well.  She said that taking it just once a day will not cause physical addiction because the half life is 12 hours.  So she said it's important to break that 12 hour cycle up to prevent physical addiction.  She said if I take it for a long time, less than 12 hours apart, apparently that's when you can get physically addicted.  The doctor said I may end up psyhologically addicted, but that's easy to kick shortly after I stop taking it.  1mg an hour before I want to go to sleep works absolutely great.  I haven't slept so good since I was a kid.  The doctor said that the only real side effects from this drug are addiction, and it's very important to get good sleep or I'll end up with other problems, like high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney problems, increased stress, etc.  So I feel any possible side effects of long term use of this drug is probably worth it.  I feel great, am probably healthier overall from it, and can get more out of life now that I don't have to walk around like a sleepless zombie all day.

It does relieve anxiety and helps me sleep at which I have trouble with both.  However, if you don't spaace out your dosages (example, 1mg every two to three days)and take it every night for more than four weeks, when you try not taking it for a night, you will have troulbe falling asleep, at least I do.  It is now 3:10am and have to be to work by 8:00am and am up looking at these reviews to see if my symtoms are common.  From what I have read so far, it seems that most people when they try to stop taking Lorazepam, have a hard time going to sleep.  Scary, for me, when I can't sleep, the anxiety attacks occur.  I have tried many sleep aids but none tried so far work as well as this med but, it comes with a price.

My primary DR prescribed .5 mg per day as needed.  I admit I take Ativan (Lorezepam) to sleep or to relax when I take long road trips and not necessarily for Anxiety.  But...here is the bad part...a few months ago, I noticed hair in the drain.  Hair in the sink.  The pillow.  Everywhere.  I did not have thick hair anyway, but now, my ponytail is so thin and limp, the hair loss is really bad.   At first I was told Ativan was not the cause.  Now, I see, it certainly can be.  So, I am taking a tiny .025 dose a day to get off of it.  I guess I will have to find another way to sleep and relax because losing hair makes me far less calm than anything else!  BEWARE if you want your HAIR!

I was up to 2mg 3 times a day for several years.  My new doctor told me that the amount I was taking was too much.  Now I am down to 120 1 mg pills per month.  This drug really works well, but over time you build a tolerance and become dependant.  I wish the doctors would have told me that when I was having panick attacks and i was deperate for releif.  This drug is definitely not meant for long term use.  I need to keep weening myself off this drug, espcially because I want to have children soon.  Mentally this is a huge struggle because they have been my crutch for so many years.  Just know these do work, but hard to stop taking after prolonged use.

I have taken it the past 4 days in a row with no side effects except I feel calmer, happier and a little sleepy but still totally functional. I started taking it in the evening so if I had any side effects maybe I could sleep through them. I am taking it earlier each day so I can benifit from the calming effects more. I am still only taking 1 pill a day. I am worried about possible side effects that could happen and addiction. But I don't want to stop taking it because it is really helping. (BTW I was in the hospital for a kidney infection not anxiety, the dr. felt I was having anxiety) Most of the reviews so far have been very positive, can anyone give me some advice on what side effects are most common, how soon side effects happen,(I've been taking it 5 days now) and how addicting it actually is? I don't really take much medicines, just tylenol and I take some herbal remidies like ST. Johns wort and Evening Primrose Oil.

This medication has helped me sleep at night along with two hydrocodone for chest wall pain. I only take the two at night thoguh because both make you feel sleepy. The Bipolar has been ruled out and so has the depression. There is still Autism at times but this medication is wonderful for anxiety and panic attacks that come at any level (whether strong or moderate). I am both a Certified Nursing Assistant and Emergency Medical Technician and find the Ativan especially helpful on very stressfull days and alot of those days just happen to fall on the day i am having chest wall pain. So If you have chest pain with your anxious feelings try adding a little bit of hydrocodone with your dr's persmission. When you get anxious your muscles tighten up as well, even your throat and airway. Hope this helps for some of you because it sure helped me.

So for the past 3 1/2 yes I have had no Insurance and no medicine.  I felt i could fight the anxiety and depression and win, be strong, however it has eaten me up and I have sadly been on  the absolute edge of survival since, hanging by a nats hair every day wondering at when my head would actually pop right off due to the extreeeeme tightness and tension I was experiencing 24/7.  I recently became inusured and have seeker treatment.  I have now been on Lorazapam for a few days only in addiion to Prestique.  The Lorasapam has saved my once desperate life, it has worked so well I can now absorb the great things and people around me and feel like I am calm and pleasant company.  I will be living my life now with complete appreciation rather than in a black hole of cutting edge pain.

I tried to not touch the bottle of pills, but finally resorted to it because I would have fainted or lost it if I didn't have them.

I only take as needed and now I pretty much carry the bottle in my purse as a saftey blanket, but rarely have to actually take a pill. However, if you are taking this for anxiety it should not be the only thing you are taking for your condition. You need to be on a everyday medication as well, this will decrease your need to take the pill and decrease your chances of dependancey. My Dr. will not perscribe this medication alone, I have to take my Effexor to get this script. But when you have a bad bout with anxiety, this is a great pill to have handy!! Usually brings me down in about 5 minutes. Also useful for help sleeping,I normally take Ambien everynight but if it gets to late or I don't feel like taking the Ambien, 1 or 2 of these and I am fast asleep....usually for the entire night!

I read side effects posted here by others. I had those experiences with Zanax and similar drugs but not this. So apparently the slight chemical differences affect people differently. Try a different member of same family if you have problems w/ this. I sleep great and do have a little dingy time in am so I take it at night. I haven't tried to quit yet so don't know if I will have problems. But I could live on this stuff for rest of life and definately be happy.

Between this and regular Psychotherapy, I feel that I really have a handle on my life for the first time.  Just watch out though... I used it nearly six days a week for an entire school year and went through some withdrawal insomnia.  It was prescribed to me ""as needed"" but watch out, regular use seems to lead to withdrawal issues sometimes.

Yesterday she was hospitalized for hypotension (a side effect) and nearly died. She is still in the hospital today.

It caused a paradoxical reaction of involuntary muscle spasm, which led doctors to incorrectly diagnose her with Parkinson's disease. She developed a high level of abuse of this drug and became sedated, and suicidal. It did not prevent her anxiety, but her addiction to the drug increased the anxiety.

I did have some side effects when I first started the drug. I was like a Zombie in a foggy movie, I couldn't think either. So I went from taking .5mg twice a day to only .5mg at bedtime that helped with the side effects. Then after a couple of weeks I started taking the .5mg twice a day. I have an appointment to see my Dr soon and I'm not sure if this is a good drug to be on because of the addiction aspect of this drug. I will be discussing this with him.

For those who understand how debilitating anxiety and insomnia are, you will find the calming effects of this drug a welcome relief. Works miracles on relieving anxiety and helping to fall asleep. Only downside is that if I stop taking it even for one night, I sleep very lightly, have lots of dreams, and wake up often.  I recommend only taking it at night if possible, because it does cause drowsiness and mild dizziness.

1613$Anxious$2/23/2008 12:43:48 PM$Reviewer: Walking the Floor, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"It take it for episodic panic attacks and general bouts of anxiety. It seems particularly valuable in situations where my anxiousness is so great that I am unable to concentrate at work. It calms me considerably thus allowing me to be more productive.

However there is a trade off. My mental acuity is not as sharp and it gives me the feeling of being slightly intoxicated. Not surprisingly it lowers my energy level and makes me feel slightly sleepy. Yet still a good trade off versus a panic freeze that makes me completely dysfunctional. Also I've discover that it is best to use the smallest dose possible that will still allow me to derive the benefit without experiencing the hazy side effects. I often break the one milligram pill in half or even quarters. 

I try never to use it more than 2 days in a row for fear of addiction.

I also use it at night for insomnia that results from racing mind syndrome. Used in conjunction with ambien, I never fails to get me to sleep and usually sleep 8 hours or more. (Wouldn't suggest this for those who have any side effects with ambien). I do have a slight hang over effect from the lorazepam which makes it hard to hit the ground running in the morning, but not as bad as the hangover you get from a night of drinking. 

Overall, I've had a good experience... and it certainly has saved many a day I would have otherwise just been pacing the floor... wringing my hands over an anxiety attack. "

1617$Anxious$2/13/2008 11:29:30 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed this drug by my physician after reporting I had shortage of breath and chest pains, numbness in my arms and dizziness. After talking about the situations when these symptoms took place and some additional testing he determined I was having panic attacks. I was told to take 1/2 of pill when I felt an attack coming on. It worked and has consistently for more than 2-years. I don't take it daily, only when I feel an attack or when I know I'm going to be in a situation that might bring one on. Also, I was diagnosed with IBS, usually also brought on by stressful situations (public speaking, meetings, etc) and this is resolved by taking the medication as well. I have, however, increased the dosage to one entire pill. If I don't use it for more than a couple weeks and then take it, side effects such as slight lightheaded-ness or dizziness, but not enough to make me not want to take it by any means. My physician put me on a very low dosage of Prozac to take on a daily basis to replace the Lorazepam because he was afraid I might develop a dependency, but I still occasionally would need the Lorazepam for panic attacks. I have quit taking the Prozac and only rely on the Lorazepam for attacks or prevention because I was never taking it regularly enough to develop dependency. I appreciate the calmness, decrease of worry and sense of ease resulting from the drug and the lack of any negative side effects.

I was so badly in pain, that I was hyperventilating and my hands were numbing up and tingling. The ER dr had the nurse give 2 doses of Ativan in my IV, and after about 5 mins or so, I begain to calm down. (IT DOES NOT TAKE PAIN AWAY, BUT JUST CALMS YOU SO THEY CAN SEE HOW MUCH PAIN RELIEF MEDS TO GIVE YOU).  My breathing slowed, and my hands resumed normal feelings. I was then given a dose of Dilaudid for pain.  The fact that they had to do 2 doses is because I was severly freaking out over the pain.  Maybe others require less Ativan, nonetheless, effective enough.   Made me want to go to sleep and had blurred vision as well.
