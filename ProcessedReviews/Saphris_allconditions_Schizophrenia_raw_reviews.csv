32$Schizophrenia$5/5/2015 2:04:41 PM$Reviewer: bethl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) $5$4$5$My husband has Paranoid schizophrenia.  He has been taking Saphris since October.  It is like a miracle drug for him.  He has gained a little weight but the trade off is worth it.  He is able to go in public without me and volunteer at church.  He is developing friendships of his own.  He still hallucinates a bit but not like before.  I have my husband back.  
34$Schizophrenia$1/24/2015 12:32:50 AM$Reviewer: erdihr, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$1$First off, this tastes HORRIBLE. Worse than the one time I got gasoline in my mouth. Aside from that, the effect on my mood after 3 weeks was awful. I was constantly angry and combative. I do not like this medication at all and will be switched to something else at the soonest possible time.

54$Schizophrenia$4/27/2013 8:03:05 PM$Reviewer: [email protected], 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$4$Saphris has finally given me a life without feeling no emotions inside. I have only been on it for about 5 weeks. I just hope I continue to feel this way. I Have been in such a bad way for many years and on every drug out out there. I was thinking if this doesn't work im going to jump, well here iam building my life
65$Schizophrenia$1/8/2013 5:52:26 PM$Reviewer: Shoshi, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$4$I had been stuck on Zyprexa and had gained almost a hundred pounds. Immediately after I started the Saphris, my weight started dropping. I am fine as far as curbing the psychotic tendencies and have now lost 30 pounds! Am a little worried about the attack on white blood cells, but am having that monitored. Thank you Dr. Dolgoff!
67$Schizophrenia$12/5/2012 1:34:16 PM$Reviewer: The Troll, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Saphris has kept me sane for 18 months. I sleep well and like the Black Cherry flavor. I am taking 30 mg a day. Nothing else worked as well.

92$Schizophrenia$5/19/2012 2:28:38 PM$Reviewer: ramborob79, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$Be careful this stuff is strong! It makes me extremely tired about 30 min after I take it at night until morning.I eat or drink the next morning and it wears off quickly.It is the only antipsychotic ive tried that I can function as well the next day without being tired most of the time.Hopefully I can take it only once a day at night because it is strong at this point and it would be hard to function taking it twice a day.I think they should make a lower dose to start people out on in case they are allergic or extra sensitive to saphris or even antipsychotics.Doctors should be extra careful with this medicine but for me it has been the best one.
93$Schizophrenia$5/14/2012 5:41:15 AM$Reviewer: wtwally, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$"Saphris didn't really stop voices completely I had some relief but maybe because it made me pass out for 8 hours which it took hold of my sleep mechanism and since I been off it a few months I cant go to sleep on my own
I cant seem to get a hold of my Dr  so I don't sleep  my sleep is ruined from saphris  I went to sleep fine before I was put on saphris a little over a year ago  I did many things too that now sit in the corner and collect dust while I sit and try to connect my incomplete thoughts that were complete back then too  my timing is slightly off
and and my tuning is bad and it was saphris
and I been wasting for it to let up and it seems to be permanent..."
99$Schizophrenia$3/19/2012 9:36:45 AM$Reviewer: Eric S, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Saphris has helped me tremendously. For years i was treated with risperdal, seroquell, haladol and others and nothing worked. Within days of starting Saphris my symptoms drastically reduced. I function normally now with very few episodes of voices. My only complaint is the taste of the stuff but i can live with it.

123$Schizophrenia$8/6/2011 10:59:23 PM$Reviewer: lanrover, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I started Saphris after unsuccessful on seroquel, zyprexa, abilify, risperdal. Results are great for me so far. Benefits include no more suspicious odors of harmful impact. Side effects are very low.  My motivation level is through the roof, it is not really restlessness and it is not really akathisia. I don't have anxiety any more like I did on the other meds. I have to take trazadoone for sleep since saphris interferes with my sleep.

125$Schizophrenia$7/29/2011 5:07:01 PM$Reviewer: NBTX2011, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $3$3$5$"My 21yr old daughter just started this med a couple days ago. First & second doses seemed to agree with her. Third dose, she suddenly was having difficulty standing, was confused, and had some muscle weakness. I do know that this med is making her sleepy, which at night is GREAT, but she needs to take it during the day as well. Wonder if these ""side effects"" will go away with a little time. She also has a history of seizures, but she has not had any since starting Saphris. My daughter would say that she was hearing voices, but hasn't mentioned the voices since she started on this med. However, it may be too soon to tell if Saphris made those voices go away for good. "

In a week my hallucinations have decreased and nearly gone. By far this is the best medication ive been on in addition to my other medications. I strongly reccommend this medincine.
137$Schizophrenia$4/21/2011 11:34:36 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$After taking Seroquel for years, Saphris gave me a new lease on life!  Wow, I wake up in the AM well rested and alert, not groggy and wanting to stay in bed all day like with Seroquel.  I had some trouble waking up too early but switching my depression med (nortriptyline) to the evening and adding a little more benzo's is working very well and I've been sleeping 7 to 8 hours a night.  Seroquel had me way overweight but with Saphris I'm loosing weight.  The first 3 days I lost 10lbs. probably all water, but since then I'm still loosing about a pound a week a total of 18 pounds so far.  I still have food cravings like with Seroquel, but not as bad.  I seem to be overeating less than before and can stop eating when I'm full.
153$Schizophrenia$1/24/2011 2:09:37 AM$Reviewer:  Female  (Caregiver) $1$1$1$Be very careful with this medication. My daughter started this medication and had to go to the ER that night because she passed out and we could not get a heart beat on her. I will never allow her to use this again. I hope it was an allergic reaction only, but recomend caution to anyone starting this med. Have a family member close by.

174$Schizophrenia$11/10/2010 1:30:59 AM$Reviewer: mcaspardiver, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I HAVE SCHIZO AFFECTIVE DISORDER WITH DUAL PERSONALITIES. I AM ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT MEDS, INCLUDING SAPHRIS SL 10MG. IN THE MORNINGS & 10MG. @ NIGHT. OUT OF ALL THE MEDS I AM ON THIS MED IS THE BEST FOR THE VOICES.
YES, I GET THE KNUMBNESS UNDER THE TOUNGE BUT, THAT IS NOTHING COMPAIRED TO THE EFFECT IT HAS ON MY HEARING VOICES ALL DAY. I DON'T HEAR THE VOICES AS MUCH NOW AFTER TAKING SAPHRIS.
I HAVE BEEN ON MANY MANY DIFFERENT DRUGS/MEDS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS, AND NONE HAS WORKED AS WELL AS SAPHRIS SL, I LIKE THE BLACK CHERRY FLAVOR IT BEATS THE ORIGINAL FLAVOR BY A LANDSLIDE."

After a week, I no longer heard voices.  After 4 months both came back, my bust size increased 2 sizes, my thyroid is messed up, & I slept 24 hrs.  I had no problem taking the med. except when I was away from home - I had to carry the whole thing in my purse, etc.
192$Schizophrenia$9/7/2010 3:48:52 AM$Reviewer: theguy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$I took this because it has no weight gain and I was happy with losing weight because of it. The cons bad tasting and having too wait ten minutes to eat or drink.Here is where it went bad.I had OCD when I was a child and it went away ,but it all started off with getting my car modified and I was not happy with the job and decided to start fixing my car and was angry , then my friends and family told me leave your car alone. It became an obsession working on my car. I ended up ruining my car and I tried fixing it ,but things kept getting worse. OK now I will get to the point, this medicine gave me obsessive compulsive disorder bad and made me an angry person. I now have a bill worth 2 grand to have my car fix because I can't control obsession when I am on this med. I quit it and started crying for the first time in 8 months because I hurt my car.

After that, no problems that I can remember. I take it at bedtime along with another AP for sleep. It does a good job of putting me to sleep almost immediately. Apparently, it continues its work during the following day.
274$Schizophrenia$5/19/2015 3:24:50 PM$Reviewer: Cj, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I herd voice and seen things scene I was a kid and now with this I have a new live. I have put on weight but this seems to be the only thing that has taken the voice and seeing things away. I take the black cherry in the morning and then at dinner. I'm able to do more then I ever have and my friends notice a difference in me and it feels so good. I'm even able to listen to music again and TV or movies. So the weight gain something I'm learning to deal with and eat better meals. I can sleep also which is a big change. Now I'm getting about 7 to 8 hours of sleep and waking up rested. So I feel this med is will though the try!!!!!!!!!
