I thought it coudn't be Effexor, but that was the only thing I was doing different, so I stoped it and with-in 2 to 3 weeks they where ALL-GONE, I couldn't beleve it, (I have a witness). I will never take it again, if it caused the warts out-side what did it do in-side? 
All I know now is that it has been 12 years since then, an now I have M.S. :("
54$Bipolar Depression$4/16/2014 12:17:19 PM$Reviewer: Aileen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on 150mgs for 7 years. Recently I forgot to take my dose with me on a two night trip away. I was shocked by the fizziness in my head that occurred. I have since gone on half dose and am doing fine. I dont want to surf over life and want to cope myself-with my own skills- hence the half dose- but i dont envisage cutting it out completely.

Current Meds- Effexor 75 mg, Lamictal 200 mg, Abilify 5 mg, Adderall 10mg 2x/day as Needed

It saved me from wasting any more time being depressed, crying, being antisocial, guilty, tired, unproductive, demotivated, uninterested, helpless, useless.

I FINALLY LEAVE MY HOUSE. WILLINGLY and REGULARLY. Daily.  I NO LONGER FEAR APPLYING FOR JOBS. I NO LONGER FEAR THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A JOB because I would have to deal with people. I am willing and eager to go out with friends, family, acquaintances, meet new people. I have confidence. I'm positive, passionate, motivated.  
SIDE EFFECTS- Only Nightmares- but become less and less and go away after 2 mos. 

Helped when nothing else did! :) I'm finally happy again."

It took 2-3weeks to see the results. My depression has been lifted. I am fearful of weight gain and withdraw symtoms. My rx medications are close to 1800.00 per month.If not working, go to the county for help. The have behavioral health workers to help you through a very dark time. This has been the absolute worst depression I have ever experienced. Death spiral. Had to choose between sitting at home suicidal and alone or be hospitalized. Been there, never want to go back. They treat you like a kindergartener. No respect for the disease we carry with us constantly. I wish everyone the best on their own journey, it can be really awful,a death spiral.

It works for my depression, but I've been aware of eye problems and other common side effects such as sexual, ringing in the ears, unusual dreams, dry mouth and constipation.  But lately I have additional problems - stomach always upset, gas, bloating, stomach cramps, itching, and muscle twitching. I am thinking of asking my doctor for a new medication.

She said results are not the same for all patients; that's why, I guess, doctors sometimes have to experience with different drugs until they find the appropriate one for the specific patient.I hope this message may be useful for many in the world afflicted by deppresion or bipolar disorder.

I was then hospitalized for 2wks in psyc unit. after trying five other med combos I was put back on effexor 300mg I also take a mood stabilizer.I no longer see a therapist(stopped 3yrs ago). I am now down to 75mg. I also take a mood stabilizer(I have bipolar).I take my meds at bedtime. This helps with the tiredness. Its very important to take at the same time everyday. I have very few side affects as long as I take it regularly.  I do have dry mouth, but gum helps with this.  and I have to be careful not to get overheated in the summer.I am not concerned with withdrawal symptoms because I will be on medication for the rest of my life.  Thats fine with me.  I have a full time job and am raising my daughter in my own. I am a very functional person now.

It worked at first but continued with serious problems and dosage would be increased. With each increase new symptoms would appear, paranoia, anger, outrageous behavior. Later I was diagnosed bipolar and added a mood stabilizer and had much more control. Problem is, the new symptoms are still present, just more controlled. And I cannot get off of it. I have tried several times. One time weaning slowly off for a period of 6 months. The withdrawl affects were unbearable. I hate it, I wish I had never started on it.

289$Bipolar Depression$4/1/2010 6:28:17 PM$Reviewer: eh, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed Effexor XR 150mg 1x/day nearly 10 years ago as an anti-depressant for bipolar.  I have had no side effects and the medication has worked well with my other medications.  I would also strongly recommend that often times have to give psychiatric drugs 8-12 weeks before they reach a therapeutic level to even work, so give them a chance.  Additionally, don't expect everything from your medications; you should also be involved in counseling and group therapy for an adequate time ( I still go regularly to a psychiatrist and to a therapist) to better help you understand whatever disorder you've been diagnosed with and help you cope with the challenges that go along with it.

300$Bipolar Depression$2/2/2010 10:34:26 PM$Reviewer: bipol, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$2$I have been placed on several medications like Effexor and I have to say that none really keep me stabilized. I'm not sure if the benefits outweigh the risks, since these medications tend to raise blood sugar and cholesterol, both of which I am dealing with now. I take it with Lamictal, klonipin, adderall, and mirapex. I don't knowh how they all combine, but I wish there was a safer way to stay stable.
313$Bipolar Depression$12/19/2009 5:34:04 AM$Reviewer: dixieanny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Upon awakening, if I did get any sleep, I had a deep crying feeling inside from my stomach to my chest. The feeling of loosing a close family member abruptly. Therefore, I could not get myself motivated to get out of bed or get dressed for the day, or general taking care of my needs/hygiene. After 6 days on effexor xr I no longer have that emotional pain inside and I get dressed half the time. I feel better, I am getting a bit more deep sleep. It is doing well for me, as I am paradoxical to so many medications. I hope it continues. I take 75 mg per day.
319$Bipolar Depression$11/24/2009 6:35:59 PM$Reviewer: erinryan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$1$I just started this medication 3 days ago and the side effectsare troubling me. First of all I think that the pharmacist gave me incorrect directions. Do they usually start someone off with: 50mg twice a day, 37.5 twice a day, and also 75 mg twice a day? That seems like a lot to me to start out with. I caaled my doc to ask about this but have not recieved a call back. I did it per these directions for 2 days and couldn't stand the vomiting after eating anything, the muscle tension that I could not control, and the clenching of my jaw. it also made me very dizzy and I had to lay down. Are these symtoms normal or am I having adverse reaction? I have been online looking up side effects but have not found an answer to how this drug is started and if I am taking too much . I took myself down to only the 50 mg twice a day until I hear from my doctor.

329$Bipolar Depression$10/27/2009 2:21:21 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  (Patient) $1$1$1$I took this medication for a long time. It had a reverse effect on me, as well as many others. It got so bad that i attempted suicide on this drug. I took a minimal amount but my liver and kidneys are about to fail. My doctor said if i would have taken effexor normally, my organs would fail in six more months. This is a horrible drug. Im sixteen and this drug has completely deteriorated my life as well as my esophagus. I recommend you do not take effexor.

It help me immensly in the beginning to slow down my head and let me concentrate on getting better.  After about 6 months when I was more stable (not suicidal) and feeling level, I decided to start weaning off.  The reason I chose to decrease my dose was because along with making me calmer and more level, I found it also took away my personal creativity and the ability to think fluidly.  I found myself having a hard time articulating and it drove me crazy.  Physically the only negative side effect I had was a strange feeling when I turned my head to fast, like what I had just looked at and turned away from was trailing me in my side vision.  
I am off effexor now and am doing well. Being on it helped me slow down and get the help I needed (talk therapy), though I am happy to be off it, as I feel more like me how I am supposed to be with no pharmecutical help.   "

At 150mg I hit a new low. Was suicidal, impulsive, vomiting constantly and had frequent panic/anxiety attacks. Was so desperate to come off this medication I went cold turkey. Huge mistake. Developed discontinuation syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms were terrible. Fever, tremors, hives, night terrors, vertigo, insomnia, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms and vomiting. By day 6 I was hospitalized with severe dehydration and exhaustion. Was immediately hooked up to an IV to replace fluids and was given anti sickness meds. Doctors introduced Effexor at a lower dosage (75mg) and devised a tapering plan. IÃ¢Â?Â?m extremely sensitive to this drug so am tapering slowly to avoid any more withdrawal symptoms. Currently on 18.75 mg (halved a 37.5mg pill). IÃ¢Â?Â?m almost free of this drug, canÃ¢Â?Â?t wait to have my life back!!!!!

I have been on it for over 10 years. There are two downsides to it though. First, it will give you the weirdest dreams you ever had...some can be very scary, but I got used to them...second thing is that it is EXTREMELY addictive. I tried to come off of it several times befor, weaning my-self off of it very slowly and carefully with my doctor....no way at all. I just couldn't do it at all. You will have extreme withdrawal symptoms...feeling like you have the flu like chills, muscle weakness, throwing up non stop during the day, extreme anger, brain zaps like you are having mild seizures but yet you are awake so, it is a very good medication but very difficult to quit. I just have to live with it I guess...

I believe I may be relieved once he weens me onto something else. this med is powerful so manange your time and exercise helps.

Took extended weaning time to get off of the drug safely.  Had extreme side effect of excessive sweating and heat intolerance that continued entire 3 years I took the drug.  Found that although physicians ask for current lists of medications you are taking-they really rarely use the list for much.  3 years of misery (sweating) 6 doctors and finally a doctor pointed out that this drug could cause the problem.

It does help tremendously with my anixety.  However, I feel my brain chemistry must really be off balance.  Because Effexor 75 mgs makes me not want to eat and I LOSE WEIGHT!!!! Which is actually and very good plus for someone who has battled their weight all there life.  Withdrawel symptoms are very weird for me.  I have a few, like extreme anxiety, heart palpatations.  But I also have numbness of the face..and I feel ""High"" which I kinda like.  The worse part of Effexor is being very careful about taking drugs that cause interactions.  I took some wellbutrin (not prescribed for me) because I was going through withdrawels and caused a psychotic episode...SO BE CAREFUL WITH INTERACTIONS.."

While I agree with everyone about the missed dose side-effects (MAN those brain ""zaps"" and vertigo SUCK!), This combo literally saved my relationship. I noted that others experienced sexual side-effects, but I have been fortunate enough to avoid them.  I also agree with the patients here that say that if you take Effexor, make sure you're in it for the ""long haul."" I am, and it has been well worth it as I feel stable again. My advice (at the risk of sounding like a commercial): make sure you consult with your doctor before starting and do NOT try to come off of this Cold Turkey!"

This combo seems to work the best for me: we have tried different combos, but to not great satisfaction. I was without Effexor for a couple of days this summer. It was an immediate & dramatic withdrawal. It seemed as if I was experiencing bursts of ""electrical activity"" in my head, I was very dizzy, all I could hear was a continuous ""white noise"" that increased with my vertigo. So, I don't plan to go off it any time soon. If I ever have to stop taking it, I will insist on constant monitoring, since I seem to be very sensitive to the drug. "

It helped with my depression for several years, but being on this drug long term caused a multitude of physical problems. In addition to confusion, sexual dysfunction, constipation, constant gas, ringing in my ears, and memory problems, in the last year I have developed severe stomach problems, weird and frightening dreams, twitching of my legs, arms and hands. I weaned myself off this drug for 2 weeks, then went cold turkey 3 weeks ago when I realized my stomach problems were improving since I stopped taking Effexor.  Right now I fight unexpected feelings of irritablility on and off all day, sadness, and frustration, but I can eat anything I want, no more heartburn or indigestion.  My sex life is back, and I have more energy. I am trying to be aware of my moods and if I feel that I need medication again, it will not be Effexor.

I have used it for a few years now. I get restless leg syndrome at night which are directly related to this drug. Last year I tried to get off it and attempted suicide within 10 days (planned it couple days before). Emotionally better when back on it but causes me to cycle into hypomania a few times yearly. If you are bipolar don't start this medicine. Request a mood stabilizer that has an antidepressant effect. Trying again to get off it. Praying all goes well this time.

I was angry and anxious even more so than before I started it. The side effects were so much worse to deal with than just being bi-polar. I was constipated, had an immense amount of weight gain, dizzy spells, headaches, backaches, unbareable periods. And as one person said brain quivers. I quit cold turkey after 3 yrs on it. It was the hardest thing in the world to do. They only thing I still notice is the anger issue. After a year off of it Ive lost 90 lbs feel much happier with myself my constipation is gone but my cramps are still more unbarible than I could ever explain. I strongly recommend getting yourself off however you can if you are taking it. Or if youre considering it DONT! Now that I have been off of it for a yr Id like to know if my period will always be like this and have I completely shot my chances of ever becoming pregnant....

I guess I'm very lucky that something finally worked.  But, on the minus side, withdrawal is a BITCH!  If I miss one dose, I get a persistant headache and my thinking becomes cloudy.  Last year, I was in the hospital for my depression and the first day there, they did not give me any meds until late in the day.  By that time, I was already feeling really crappy.  The nurse insisted that what I was feeling was not withdrawal.  I knew better, of course.

I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 12, I am 26 now, and this is the ONLY drug that has worked for me. I have tried many, many medications and Effexor has had the best results with the least amount of side effects. Granted, the withdrawals are terrible, but if you are responsible and don't run out before you refill, this is not a problem. I have had NO weight gain because of this medication. My opinion is this goes to show you that these types of medications work differently for different people, so don't put too much credence in these reviews.

HOWEVER...
I went to Hawaii on vacation and forgot my meds.  Luckily I was able to get more but it took 4 days.  The first 2 days without Effexor Xr were tollerable.  The last 2 days I was extremely suicidal.  My withdrawal symptoms included extreme suicidal thoughts, awful taste, heebie-jeebies, clothes felt like sandpaper, people touching me freaked me out, socially a mess and horrible nightmares.  The devil was one step behind me...Mind you I was on holiday in Hawaii.  Hours after taking my dose I felt reborn and finally enjoyed the wonderful environment. 
This drug is very powerful. Every debilitating reason I took the drug was hightened 10 fold during withdrawals.  
I don't have the funds to pay for the drug so Wyeth has supported me with free meds through their patient assistance program.

It must be doing something bad to me inside if it is so powerful as to prompt such horror stories about withdrawals.  I too wish someone (myself?) had informed me about that side effect before I started this drug.  I can't think of anythig else each time I take the med.  I feel as though I am being held hostage by Effexor.  I plan on going to a detox hospital in Ocala in Jan. to get off it, as I see a drug addict each time I look in the mirror.  I don't know what I will do about the depression.  Perhaps there is a drug for me that will not make me fat and isn't akin to detoxing of of herion.

I have taken it for a number of years now.  Other antidepressants either just didn't work well for me or incompletely addressed my symptoms, resulting in under- or over-medication as my prescribers tried different combinations.  I was recently offered the opportunity to try a different medication, but I'm not risking it.  Effexor XR has been a life saver for me.  I do wonder about my weight gain, and development of type II diabetes, but I could not face life again the way I was before this medication lifted me out of depression and anxiety and let me know what ""normal"" feels like."

Life drains me enough. 
1956$Bipolar Depression$11/4/2009 9:23:20 PM$Reviewer: Billy BUBB, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$"I have been around the block as far as anti-depressants go- nardil, amitriptoline, asendin, and several others, including tri-cyclics.  Was on Prozac later, then Lexapro.  With Lexapro, I felt a lot better as far as moods and swings went, but after taking it for 4 years, it leveled off and worked less and less.  Then I took Effexor.  
I feel a lot better, and more level mood wise.  I've been suicidal since age 14, and am now 54.  I've gotten past the pain part, so 'leaving town' isn't the issue it once would have been.  IOW, it'd be a whole lot easier to do myself in now than before, were it not for wife and kids who would take it as something their fault.
I liked Lexapro, but it stopped working out.  Effexor works, but all the posts and comments are scaring me.  What to do?  stop and die, or keep taking it and die, or at least deal with powerful side effects, while the other part of effexor allows a better life for the time being.  A pill for every need- medical legacy of the USA.  Just a wholly BIZARRE plight to be in.  Here I thought that other stuff I was experiencing was some other pill. sweating, lucid dreams, strange physical sensations, 'blank spots' during the course of the day or workday, strange physical pains or feelings.  Maybe back to Lexapro.
Thank you all for posting, for your experiences have led me to think about other realms that had not occurred to me...  Just so bizarre!  And yeah, even the sex dept has gone south"

1984$Bipolar Depression$10/22/2009 9:21:30 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I did not take Effexor XR very long because it hospitalized me with SEVERE DEPRESSION and SUICIDAL THOUGHTS at a very low dose. I realize that I just had a very bad reaction to this drug, but it was the worst reaction I have had from any of the medications I have been on for Bipolar Depression (close to 15). I now take Cymbalta, which is also a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and it has been one of the best medications I have ever been on. My advice for anyone who is considering taking Effexor XR is to look out for a severe reaction involving depression and suicidal thoughts. I wasn't sure if my reaction was to Effexor XR or another new drug I was taking, but it turned out to be Effexor XR. I thought I could just tough it out through the side effects and that it would maybe get better, but that was a horrible mistake that put me in the hospital.  Just be sure to use caution when starting this medication!

This drug is SUPER ADDICTIVE and it took me trying to go off for over a year and 3 different times to get off.  I finally got off of it with 2 ER visits and the worst withdrawal symptoms I could ever imagine experiencing.  I have been off now for a month and am still dealing with some of the withdrawal symptions that are still hanging in there.  Doctors don't tell you how terribly addictive this drug is so be super careful and really decide if you want to become so addicted and dependent on a drug. When I was on it I had to take it to the exact hour every day or I'd start getting withdrawal symptoms.  Just be very careful with this one.

If a dose was missed or late, I would immediately feel ""shocks"" throughout my entire body; like I was being electrocuted. It has been the most difficult and worst experience of my life to come off of these drugs.  It has taken several months for the withdrawals to stop even though I have been slowly weaning myself off.  During this time I have been extremely angry, self destructive and suicidal.  I truly did not think I would make it.  The coming off effexor part has been so terrible that I cannot remember if it worked for me for all those years or not.  My doctor did not offer any support except to say that ""everyone goes through the ""shock"" feelings...You just have to deal with it"".  Obviously she had never been through this as I am sure most doctors will never get themselves hooked on these drugs.  I did not know what to do.  If it weren't for my husband & family I am 90% sure I would have killed myself.  I will never allow my body to become addicted to these types of medications again.  Please do not take the first doctor's prescription and believe that he/she has your best interest in mind.  Please seek second or third opinions.  Drug companies offer incentives to doctors for selling their ""drug"" and as we all know, anti-depressants are the trendy, hot drug and there is so much competition the pharmaceutical companies have to push doctors to prescribe their brand.  I am not saying that medication should never be used; it helps many, many people - just PLEASE protect yourself. I am telling you now, if you start Effexor XR, you will end up taking it everyday for the rest of your life or you will go through the worst pain, depression, anger you will ever experience trying to get off Effexor XR AND you cannot do it by yourself - you need someone to watch out for you."

(I took it for several years before switching to Pristiq a few months ago.)  Initially and for several years after starting Effexor XR, it did a good job treating my depression associated with Bipolar Disorder (I take mood-stabilizers as well!)  Effexor XR was, at one time, the best anti-depressant I had ever taken in terms of mood symptoms.  I did have some gastrointestinal side-effects; diarrhea and stomach-aches.  However, I medicated those in addition to taking the Effexor XR, because the Bipolar was ""a bigger issue.""  After approx. 4 years though, the effect from the Effexor XR diminished and I had to take an increased dose, which brought more side-effects and less impact on elevating my mood.  If I ever missed a dose of Effexor XR or took it a bit late, my head would feel dizzy and horrible.  I went off the medication twice.  Once, (a former) doctor did not have another anti-depressant for me to switch too and that was a nightmare, both with bad side-effects and mood issues.  The second (and final) time I discontinued the Effexor XR, I started Pristiq and my new doctor helped make a very smooth transition by decreasing the Effexor XR and increasing the Pristiq.  So, overall, Effexor XR may prove very effective, but may have some side-effects.     "

This drug, if it's not taken at a specific time every day, can send you into a violent manic tailspin, and no matter how much you know what you're doing is crazy, you can't stop it. If you have a sleep disorder, and cannot be sure of the exact time you take your meds, this drug is a death wish. It nearly cost me a husband, and my son, because this drug didn't help with my depression, and trying to come off of 300mg is a long process, and a dangerous one. I was suicidal, more so than ever, on this drug, and when I spoke to other members of my family, and friends, that took effexor xr, no one had anything good to say, whether they took 37.5 mg, or 300mg. Coming off XR, I had to lock myself in my bedroom, and pray that I wouldn't flip out because I was seriously scared of myself, and couldn't control my mood swings. This drug has done more harm than good in everyone that I've talked to.  DANGEROUS

My mom was convinced that there was something wrong and we went to the doctor and she made it seem like i was literally going crazy. Well they put me on 150 mgs at 17 years old and i definitly noticed a difference, but it wasnt a good one. I felt like the drug made me severely depressed and i would have night sweats and couldnt sleep. I became a person i didnt know anymore, but my mom made me take the pills. I was on them for almost 2 years and then i got pregnant and stopped immediately. Now im not on any meds and i've never been happier in my life. I dont think i ever needed to be on effexor or any medication for that matter. So my advice is, dont give this medication to teenagers.

It has lessened my appetite and in 2 weeks I have lost 4 pounds. I find I need to supplement with Seroquel to keep my mania in check. I have had one episode of severe shakiness and my blood pressure rose as did my pulse rate. My blood pressure returned to normal, but my heart rate stayed elevated all day--87, as opposed to 68. I am only on 75 mgs a day. I like Effexor, but I do have to worry about this manic feeling I have all the time. It's not good for me to feel this way. Seroquel works, but it makes me gain weight. I don't want to have to take both consistently. Anyone else have feelings of mania with Effexor XR?

No thanks, would rather feel sad or anything but that ""zoned-out"" thing. And really don't think I am bi-polar. Have never experienced that mania thing you read about where you don't sleep for days. Guess the best thing I have learned from this is get educated before you take anything. My doc did not discuss the withdrawal fun. Will be so glad when my ears quit ringing! And got so queasy on day 2 that I threw up a salad. Yuck. Am making a committment to myself to eat better and exercise. Work on my relationship with God, my husband, friends, and spoil my dogs.

It has created side effects worse than the depression I first started taking it for.  I now have episodes of extreme anger, and self harm and fear that I may one day harm one of my young children.  I am very distressed with the fact that I have tried to taper off and have severe withdrawals.  I am more depressed because of the side effects and withdrawals than I was before I began taking Effexor. I wish I had sought a more natural approach to depression such as diet changes, exercise, and support groups.  I am disappointed that my insurance will pay for this drug and not for the herbal supplements that have been more effective and not detrimental to my health?  Why do they allow me to take a medication that is causing me physical and mental harm and yet shun the very things that could improve my health in every arena?  I am angered that I have lost ten years of my life and have damaged the relationships with my loved ones due to side effects and inability to quit taking this medication. Those who promote this drug need to know that I fully regret taking Effexor when there are other avenues. More natural, healthy and effective methods should be actively encouraged before prescribing such a  damaging drug. This should be a LAST alternative, if not totally banned.

I have no great side effects from the drug and would reccommend it to anyone with bipolar. This is a great drug...have tried others but they either didn't work or they lost thier effectiveness after a year to 18 months.

I have been on this drug for 4 years with only the sexual side effect so for me it is worth it!

I recently ran out of med's and went thru 3days of withdraw and that has beenthe worst feeling in my entire life i passed out twice didnt eat and just was miserable..

Overall I'm not as depressed as I use to be. Doctor upped my dosage to 300mg. If I missed a dose, I get tingling in my lips and get a terrible headache.

3852$Bipolar Depression$11/25/2007 9:11:00 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Very effective, except for my inevitable January to April depression.  This period of time re4quires supplementation with Wellbutrin.  Downside is withdrawal if you forget to take Effexor for one day.

It's by far the most effective antidepressant I've tried, however after increasing the dosage up to 300 mg. daily I was still having major mood swings. I was then put on Lamictal (a mood stabilizer) and the combination of the 2 drugs has been a very good ""cocktail"" for me."
3873$Bipolar Depression$11/18/2007 8:30:27 PM$Reviewer: Janice, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$I find it very helpful, however, after taking it for 3 months the side effects are starting to put a strain on me. They are heart palpitations that sometimes continue throughout the day, eye problems such as different exam results that leave me with going back and forth on the right prescriptions and eye strain, excessive sweating, and issues with my ovulation cycle, which made me believe that I was going through an early change of life! I was told by my gynocologist as well as other doctor's that these are side effects caused by this medication. I am very upset, I am taking a small dose and now have to decide what to do, is it all worth it?
3889$Bipolar Depression$11/14/2007 10:07:04 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$3$I have been on a regime of various drugs for about 6 years, and Effexor has been the one that finally became a staple in the mix, along with Welbutrin.  The only huge NEGATIVE is the withdrawal effects.  When trying to go off the drug, the effects were unbearable! So, if on a high dose and tapering off, do so very slowly, you will be thankful for it!  Otherwise, I have found it to be a very helpful drug for my depression and anxiety, and it also provides and extra energy boost!

When it seems like it isn't working anymore, increase your dose. After 5 years, I am having a problem with it working for me, so my doctor is now adding to it. Also, try Vitamin B's, which really helps too. I have experienced a change in the meds when I have to take antibiotics, and have seen my molar teeth crumble. Don't know if it is related, but if you experience any of these, write Wyeth, I have.

4053$Bipolar Depression$10/5/2007 1:16:40 PM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$Not a great choice for me. I'm not the type of person that likes to take medication period. The withdrawal from stopping is the worse I've ever experianced. Its like taking LSD. It works in the beginning but subsides the longer you take it. 
4073$Bipolar Depression$9/28/2007 11:24:33 AM$Reviewer: Lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$2$4$A nurse pract. put me on this for depression without taking a family history(my father and sisiter are bi-polar) and sent me into my first flying manic within two weeks! It landed me in a one year manic before I knew what it was, before I got help. I left my husband, had affairs with woman and men until I finally got to a Pdoc and got on drugs for Bi polar. I am finally stable now, two years later with my life very different and a family ruined. I tried to go off the effexor and crashed and tried to commit suiside. So I love and hate this drug!
4082$Bipolar Depression$9/26/2007 11:28:50 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$You cannot drink alcohol while taking this medication. If you do drink, only limit to one alcoholic beverage per hour.  For mania and BPD symptoms, this drug works well in combination  with Lamictal (an anti-convulsant). This combo treatment helps immensely. Talk to your doctor about it.
