Other meds SSRIs had disastrous results. Good for increasing or restoring dopamine. Little to no bad sexual effects. Been on it 11+ years now retired 10 yrs. Lifesaving med for me.
31$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/1/2016 2:11:10 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$5$I was on Fluoxetine for anxiety for 8 years. Switched to Bupropion cause the Fluoxetine was decreasing my sex drive. My anxiety has returned to basically where it was before I started taking the Fluoxetine. Was prescribed Buspirone in addition to try and help more with anxiety but really hasn't helped much. Sex drive has only gotten slightly better.

I still have some depression and frustruated of having to take these drugs, I also exercise a lot for my mood and health. I;m thinking I will go back to 150mg to see if that makes a difference/

It's to be taken in the morning to give you a little pep and shouldn't be taken late in the afternoon or evening.  It's basically an upper.  You would sleep well taking it late.

I  wasn't happy, couldn't get excited.  5 years later NEW Dr put me on Wellbutrin and all of that cleared up, I had energy and laughed. Now on BupropionHCI SR 100mg every morning otherwise the dark clouds start to appear.
431$Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/31/2017 3:51:56 PM$Reviewer: Nate82, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I've now been on generic Wellbutrin for 3 weeks and feel no different. I did experience some side effects at first; no appetite and nauseous for a week and a lot of dreams when sleeping. Now I'm experiencing nothing, no positives or negatives. Not sure why? I have some anxiety and depression but mainly depersonalization so maybe this isn't the right drug for me.
721$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/5/2019 11:37:49 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Worst experience of my life. Increased my anxiety to the point of panic attacks. I have never had panic attacks in my life! I was dizzy constantly, had muscle aches in my neck and back, was stressed beyond measure! I’ve been off it for 10 days and still feeling anxious and panicky. This was just awful.
732$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/9/2018 10:53:10 PM$Reviewer: Rumi, 65-74 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$This med acts like an amphetamine for the first week (hyperfocusing, inability to sleep at first, loss of appetite) but after a week of so, the effect changes; makes me very calm ,reduces anxiety, helps me sleep better than before I started taking it, increases motivation and pleasure just generally. So maybe stick with it for a few weeks before giving it up....... as it becomes very effective for me.

I've been feeling very ""spacy"" in the afternoons and my dr. and I decided to get rid of paxil and Xanax and try welb.  I started on 75 twice a day while reducing paxil and Xanax.  I increased to 150 twice a day and it was awful!!  I was hallucinating for a couple hours one day and it scared the crap out of me.  I was way overthinking things.  Scary!!  Back to 75 mg. twice a day.  Started with a cold when everyone around was sick and ended up with sinusitis.  I have been sick for 5 weeks!!  Nausea, dizzy, no taste, no smell, sinus pain, ""floaty"" head.  On antibiotics for 2 weeks and feel worse.  Called both primary and anxiety dr.s to see if it is welb or sinusitis symptoms.  Still don't know, but I was feeling great the first month!!  I want that back!!  will have to wait for sinus to go away."
764$Anxiousness associated with Depression$7/30/2016 4:22:55 PM$Reviewer: Rosalia, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I've always had anxiety but got deep depression later in my teens. I still struggle with deep depression and anxiety. Due to the depression, I was constantly fatigued and couldn't concentrate. I was always sleepy. After taking Wellbutrin, it's helped tremendously. I feel like me again. I'm no longer constantly fatigued or sleepy. Unfortunately, I can't concentrate sometimes, but most times I can. As far as side effects, my doctor later instructed for me to take the medicine in the morning because it would give me insomnia. I'm relatively small so I need to have a good meal or drink lots of water or else I can get a bad stomach ache or even throw up. I also hear ringing in my ears at times. 
767$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/22/2016 12:55:54 PM$Reviewer: Retired Soldier, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I returned from my third combat deployment in 2011, after each deployment, starting in 2004, I suffered more and more symptoms Anxiety, depression mood swings, severe anger and having to retire from the Army in 2012. Was diagnosed with PTSD. I went through the gambit of anti-depressants/anxiety medications over the years. I had major side affects to all and was down to Wellbutrin or Zoloft. Tried Wellbutrin and it had been working great, minimal side effects, up to 250mg a day. Earlier this year I had sinusitis with fluid in my ears, doctor prescribed a steroid and Augmentin. Within 3 days I had a horrible, metallic taste in my mouth. Figured it was from the new medication. It was so bad I couldn't eat and lost 12lbs in 1 1/2 weeks. I stopped the additional meds and the metallic taste has subsided, but took about 2 months to clear up. Now I have a minimal lack of taste,(best example-I can't taste chocolate) a side effect of the Wellbutrin which is all I take now. I like this medication, it has helped make me myself before Afghanistan, but why am I having this side effect now after 3 years of use? My Dr. has stepped me back to 200mg, but I am pretty much out of options for other meds. Do I keep suffering not being able to enjoy food or come of the meds and risk feeling like the world is about to explode and I have to fight my way through it?

I've been taking Welbutrin for 28 days and I feel worse than I have ever felt in my life.  I will stick with it for the 6 weeks that my doctor has suggested I try, but this experience has been horrible.  I'm fortunate in that I am retired and can take the time I need to concentrate on my mental health.

1554$Anxiousness associated with Depression$8/16/2016 3:34:38 PM$Reviewer: Amy, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I have been taking it for appx. 3 weeks.  The first two were golden...lots of energy, my thoughts were unclouded and I felt focused for the first time in a long time. I woke up rested, not lethargic all day.  My orgasms seemed wonderfully explosive, something I hadn't experienced in years.  Another thing I liked was I would wake up at 4:00 a.m., well before my alarm.  I was on-time everywhere.  It was amazing....so I thought.  Then on the 3rd week, I had the most awful mood swings I have ever felt in my life.  I was mean, extremely agitated, I wanted to hurt people, I was so angry.  I cried over commercials, anything with music...slow or fast.  Everything was making me cry and everything was making me mad.  My appetite seemed to increase.  I couldn't control my eating.  I immediately called my doctor the next business day and she switched me right away.  I hate that it didn't work for me because I loved the energy and sex drive. But, in the end it's not worth the ""crazies"" that came along with it, for me."
1562$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/12/2016 10:45:47 AM$Reviewer: hopeful, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$In the past 2 years, I started taking SSRI's to deal with anxiousness - starting with Lexapro and then Effexor.  I gained 20 pounds very easily, completely lost my sex drive and became depressed. I did some research and I started taking the generic form of this drug while weening off of Effexor and had HORRIBLE side effects - dizziness, nausea, and a terrible itchy rash on the inside of my legs. I discontinued the generic version and have started taking Wellbutrin brand name 150 mg once a day. It's only been a couple weeks but I've noticed increased sweating (especially at night - I wake up drenched in sweat and have to change clothes) vivid scary dreams, and today some dizziness. Can anyone tell me if this will subside or if I'm just not meant to take any form of this drug?? I was really hoping to lose some weight and also treat my ADD with this so I could focus at work again. Willing to stick it out for awhile to see if the side effects go away.

First given Zoloft and I had felt like a zombie and all I wanted to do is sleep. Stopped this horrible drug after 4 weeks and Dr gave me Wellbutrin.  The start up side effects were hard but well worth the wait. TYOU NEED TO GIVE THE MED A FULL 6 to 8 WEEKS TO WORK  Started feeling better after 2 weeks but felt the full effects in 7 weeks - Well worth the wait. .  No more depression and very little anxiety.  I did take .5 mg of Klononpin at start up to help with the anxiety.  After 8 weeks I no longer need the Klonopin and this drug is a mircle drug for me

The first week felt euphoric. My brain felt like it was growing, or at least, I was accessing parts of it that I hadn't in a L O N G time. The first 2 months I had: lots of headaches, loss of appetite, and increased heart rates at times. It was similar to having too much coffee; I was jittery. After 2 months that all faded away. Now, 6 months in, I can see that during my menstral cycle, my symptoms have increased. More cramping and bloating. I didn't have those symptoms before, but now I notice that they are regular symptoms for me. Might be the meds, might be my body developing. I had occasionally smoked cigarettes - like 1-2 times a month. I am absolutely, positively NOT IN THE MOOD for a cigarette - ever. It is incredibly unappealing to me now, even as occasionally as I had done it.

537$Depressed Mood Disorder Occurring Every Year at the Same Time$1/24/2011 11:48:05 PM$Reviewer: gammyd, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$1$4$I have been on a combination of 300 mg Wellbutrin and 150 mg of Effexor for 10 years. I have finally weaned myself off of the Wellbutrin gradually as it caused trouble sleeping which then required that I take 2mg of clonazepam. My dreams were so vivid and weird. I would be running and running all the time and wake up exhausted. I'd dream about people I hadn't seen in 20 years who I barely knew. Wild weird dreams and extrememly vivid. I have been able to cut my clonezapam down to 1mg and hope to gradually wean myself off of that as well. I hate taking a narcotic to offset the effects of the Wellbutrin. It did pull me out of a severe depression which was the lowest point of my life but I hope to make it without it. I waited until after the seasonal fall depression was over before beginning my withdrawal of the drug. I had attempted to quit smoking and my doctor gave me a stop smoking medication. The combination made me feel suicidal. Do not take Wellbutrin in addtion to Chantix.....!!!! ever ever. My depresson started when I was peri-menopausal 
542$Depressed Mood Disorder Occurring Every Year at the Same Time$12/3/2010 2:14:58 PM$Reviewer: KateBogz, 19-24 Female  (Patient) $5$5$4$I started this medication due to on and off depression, especially seasonal(winter). I have been on 150mg SR daily for 3 weeks. Definitely had a lot of side effects the first week and half. Noticed diaherra, nausea, lack of appeitie,sweats,flushing,couldn't sleep and would wake up worried someone was in my home. The symptoms have gone away the long I was on it. I do feel more upbeat and less lethargic. Plan to continue medication as long as it is reasonable in price.

Seasonal Affective Disorder.  The first 6 days I was very foggy, with a lot of somewhat sad thoughts and a lot of jittery-ness.  The past 3 days I have been pining over old regrets, and mistakes I made a long time ago.  Perhaps the medicine is adjusting my focus level.  The fogginess has gone, but I am struggling to get to that 3-4 week threshold when I hope to feel better.  Winters in New England suck, and I feel like this year started early.  Hoping that things kick in and make me more level.  I plan on getting off of the Wellbutrin come spring, when the clouds always clear.  My energy level has been normal, but the jitters have been irritating.  I will review again later.

I had been on Zoloft, Abilify, etc etc and none of them helped me like Wellbutrin XL has! I've been on it 2 years now and usually stay at 150mg,during the hard time of year for me (Dec/Jan) I go up to as high as 450mg. This drug has been a miracle in my life, it gives me time to notice red flags, like feelings of hopelessness, failure, dread, and wanting to die.. and so I can up my dose before things get out of hand..like in the past (suicide attempts etc). Give this med a try if you haven't had much success with some of the others! I've even lost weight on this medication because it gives me more energy.

I'm wide awake after 4 hours of sleep but it only lasts for a couple of weeks and then I sleep fine.  They both make me a little scatter brained but especially the 300mg.  It's hard to concentrate.  But as far as the depression goes its great.  The GENERIC did not work AT ALL!  I've had many rounds with my insurance getting them to pay for the name brand but the generic simply did nothing for me.

I had to stop it because it made my depression worse. I felt hopeless and started having suicidal thoughts. I was tired all the time and I felt like all I wanted to do was sleep. It took so much energy to get up and do ANYTHING that it like I was fighting with my inner stubborn child to get anything done. Including going to the bathroom. My mind felt like I was in a fog bubble and I couldn't think. I had to concentrate very hard about just basic things. I became cranky, irritable and downright ridiculously rude. Anything that I thought fell right out of my mouth no matter what it was. I couldn't stand being around me... I know no one else did either. Having two children that I homeschool, I couldn't stay on the medicine. I decided that mild depression was better than being psychotic and on the verge of catatonic.

I started treating my disorder with prozac which threw me completely off balance and gave me severe moodswings. I moved on to Effexor which was effective for a bit over a year but then lost effect. My doctor then changed me to Wellbutrin XL which has been great. While I had no side-effects onthe original brand, I decided to try the generic brand. I gained a lot of weight ad fell a bit into a slump- a doctor I consulted told me the generic brand had a shorter half-life than the original; making it less effective. 
MOREOVER- WHILE ON THE GENERIC BRAND (2 months) I HAD AN EPISODE OF SEVERE SEIZURES!!
My neurologist told me to avoid the generic Wellbutrin as it put you at greater risk and that he had two other patients with the same situation."

She was only 42 years old. The psychiatrist prescribed this to also help me deal with my child being hyperactive.

CONS: It made me feel very hot, sweaty, uncomfortable. If I take it in the morning I am tired, if I take it at night I am wide awake. As a mother of toddlers I need my sleep.

PROS:
Helped with anxiety, weightloss, nervousness.

I have learned getting over a death is not easy but with medication, relaxation and talking it out helps.

On the other hand, I am not sure what is worse the anxiety etc. or the terrible sweats and feeling like I have a terrible fever and cannot move at times.

If you are concerend and will not take medication due to weight gain, this is the medication for you."

It really helped with the crying, but it increased my anxiety dramatically and I'd never had anxiety before. I also feel it made my emotions very ""flat"". So instead of crying all the time I was having very few emotions even when I should be. I went from a formerly bubbly, motivating person (prior to the depression) to a quiet, withdrawn person who was too afraid to go outside and run and running has been my life for 15 years. I'm going to talk to my doctor about reducing the dose. "

23$Depression$1/21/2017 12:26:54 PM$Reviewer: DEC, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"This drug saved my life, and probably my marriage. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever. I started on 150mg time release two years ago, and after six months increased to 300mg time release. I take it early every morning once per day, but do not find that it has any effect my ability to sleep. One artifact of taking Bupropion is that I can no longer drink alcoholic beverages without feeling awful, so I have quit drinking completely. This is probably for the best, as before I started using this medication, I drank heavily for 20 years in an attempt to ""self medicate"" my depression. Even though I still love the taste, I have no desire to drink anymore - I'm much happier living without depression than I ever was getting drunk. It seems a small price to pay for the miracle that it has performed in my brain chemistry. I still feel down and sad from time to time, but now it's because I have a reason for it, like people with normal brain chemistry. You're supposed to have mild depressed feelings when bad things happen, and so I've learned to distinguish between these feelings and the depression I lived with most of my life. I have more energy, am more motivated, and can retain my mental focus better than I have in years. I'm more willing to and capable of interacting socially with people, despite being a severe introvert. I'm less of a pessimist and generally more pleasant to be around now than before I began treatment. I wish I'd been prescribed it when I was a teenager, as I believe my life could have been so different. I wouldn't stop taking Bupropion at this point even if they tried to tell me that I didn't need it anymore. I expect to take it for the rest of my life, and I'm fine with that."

BIG mistake to switch from Pristiq to this.  This medication has made me feel like a zombie.  I feel achy, hungover, tired, depressed, and have lost all energy and will to exercise.  The only thing that helped me last night was taking 50 mg of the Pristiq again. I am stopping this generic immediately.  I would be willing to try the brand name Wellbutrin XL as I have read many reviews stating that the generic and brand name versions are very, very different.  I would be willing to bet that I would not have had this negative experience if my doctor had prescribed the the brand name version instead of the generic.  Now, onto Fetzima tomorrow.  Hopefully that works better!

My sexual dysfunction of delayed or nonexistent orgasm has completely reversed. That is a good thing. I think my dizziness, confusion, feeling of ineptness may be from the drug. I will reduce the dosage to 150 mg to see if that helps.  I was on Lexapro.
72$Depression$7/2/2014 1:23:33 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) $5$5$5$Very effective for me. My dose started out with 45mg per day which I would recommend, reduces the risk for any side effects. I am now up to 300 XL with 150 SR upon waking. The only side effect I have experience was dizziness when starting the med. I now have been on the bupropion for 6 months with only positive results. This med is not given for people with anxiety disorders because it does act as more a stimulant.

81$Depression$4/15/2014 4:27:30 PM$Reviewer: Y_We_Here, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$First took bupropion several years ago and had no more desire to smoke.  This was before it was prescribed for people who wanted to quit smoking.  I mentioned that to my doctor and he discounted it.  Whatever.  Bupropion worked very well for me with my chronic depression for a few years mostly by helping me focus and get out of bed in the morning.  I switched to Paxil when the side effects of clenching my jaws and muscle tremors outweighed the benefits.  Paxil was awful -- I picked my skin, drank too much alcohol, had no impulse control, couldn't cry, gained weight.  Tried Zoloft next -- suffered massive, gross skin sores; toe, foot and leg cramps; urinary incontinence.  Then tried Cymbalta which seemed like it worked, but was too expensive, so I went back to bupropion.  It's worked really well for a few months.  My skin is good again and my emotional responses are normal.  I can get up and go in the morning, even though I'm very wakeful during the night.  I lost my Paxil weight.  However, I'm bummed because I'm starting the jaw clenching again and feel that slide toward needing another change.  Ack!  At least I'll be retired in a couple of weeks and only my daughters and dogs will have to join me for my next medication ride.  I'm hopeful it'll be a smooth transition.

And just maybe i can repair my relationship with my husband. I had 2 strokes in '97 which put me on this horrible path of mental pain and it makes me depressed just thinking how long it took me to figure everything out.

I wanted to try Adderall for focus on school and general duties; along with depression, but doctor gave me this. Overall, this worked for me. I got out of bed, got done what NEEDED to, and lost weight fast,which motivated me more. After 1 week, I decided to get off it because of my circumstances...new job, school-had to perform as all eyes were on me, and most certainly felt that. The bad...I was overly self-conscious, my heart raced to where I felt tired but felt I had to do something because I couldn't sleep. My memory sucked...I felt spacey. Now, if I weren't in the new job with all this pressure, I would have stuck with it to see if SE went away. My question to ANYONE out there (please answer!!) is do these SE go away? Thinking to ask for half the dose and up it as needed. In the meantime, has anyone divided the tablet or is that not recommended with Extended release? Many thanks for any info. I am not on any other drugs by the way. Oh yes, another great thing...I am a heavy drinker which I found hard to stop but this helps and that is a wonderful thing...fewer cravings.

So far I am not impressed with it. I am currently also taking 150mg of Effexor Extended Release.  Was on 225mg Effexor until 2wks ago when doctor started me on Bupropion.  The Bupropion the doctor has me on is the immediate release one b/c she wants to see if its working since Im also taking the Effexor.  After I take the Bupropion I can feel the effects for about an hour, but after that nothing.  It makes me tired & sleepy.  Im thinking maybe my dose needs to be raised and I need to be put on the extended release tab instead.  I go back to the doctor in a week so I will voice my concerns then. 
98$Depression$1/23/2014 2:10:58 AM$Reviewer: berlinATX, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $3$1$5$"I had taken Wellbutrin for depression with successful results approx 10 years ago and had very favorable results: I had energy to get through the day, felt all-around better. But eventually it just stopped working (and I had reached the maximum dosage/day)I found the more I spoke to others who were taking the med (or had taken) said they had the same experience. 
Now I've been taking Prozac for the same reason and it works shockingly well but I have 0 libido...no more like -25 libido and have no highs or lows. Granted I'm not crying and it's helped my fibro-myalgia, improved my sleep and cut down on sweating but I'm a creative person and have lost all creative emotion. Enter Wellbutrin again. First day I've got pupils so dilated I can hardly function, massive anxiety, can't sleep, can't eat, nausea, everything smells strong and sickens me. I felt generally serotonin sick. I think if I had a benzo script I could muddle through but I've yet to have any psychiatrist give me one in over 5 years since Xanax got ""trendy"". Needless to say, I'm back at Prozac until I can even tell my doctor what happened. 
My advice is follow your gut. If you feel really horrible, it's probably not worth forcing it. I've done that with other meds like Paxil and wound up in the ER with mania and not a single doctor in the whole place intersted in or able to help...and that's scary."

The more he asked me questions, the more I finally realized that I was depressed and had been for a couple of years. I was having such negative dark thoughts and the doctor prescribed this to me with a high dosage immediately.  It took a few weeks but I am so glad I got help.  I started to feel better, had more energy where before I could barely make it through the day. I lost weight and started feeling more positive.  I experienced an increase in libido and a slightly decreased appetite.  I started exercising and although I've suffered some additional setbacks, I have learned how to deal with them and keep moving forward.  I have forgotten to take my pills for 2-3 days at a time and I have began to feel ""icky"" again.  I am a work in progress and I hope that one day I will be able to live pill free by exercising regularly and eating a clean diet...I am working towards that but for now I am very happy with this medicine.  As for side effects, I am lactose intolerant and have IBS so any nausea or other discomfort have been indistinguishable.  I have occasionally experienced dizziness and slight headaches but other than that, I have not significant side effects.  "

I went and saw a psychiatrist instead of my primary care physician who knows nothing about mental health. The psychiatrist first started me on 150mg of Bupropion and advised me to continue to take the Cymbalta as well. The first week I could feel a major difference. I had a hard time sleeping at night but that went away after a week. But my feelings and moods were changing and I felt so much happier. Within the first month of taking 150mg, my appetite decreased, my energy INcreased, my moods became much more pleasant...and I was becoming a more positive person. But I was still feeling a few signs still of my Depression. My bed is my ""safe haven"" and where I go when I am depressed, I nap. I encountered about a handful of naps in that one month. I was still feeling like a worry-wart and had irritation issues. So when I saw the psychiatrist again after those 4 wks, he increased my dosage to the 300XL while still taking 120mg of Cymbalta. This is now my 2nd week taking this medicine with the increased dosage... and I feel absolutely amazing. I feel as though I have woken up from a deep sleep. I have so much energy. I can exercise because I have motivation. I am so much more pleasant with people at work and just in general. I can think rationally and be positive. I feel absolute love for myself. I no longer feel like a worthless, ugly, ashamed individual who could never leave the house. I feel A L I V E. I could literally hug my psychiatrist for listening to me and not over-medicating me.

I never felt a difference on either dosages; I was still very depressed and still had several crying episodes.  The feeling of sadness and emptiness still lingered.  I hoped it would help with my anxiety as well, but it didn't help with that either.  I'm not surprised by the ineffectiveness of this drug because I have never taken an antidepressant that has changed my mood and kept my anxiety at ease.  I wasted my money on this drug.

I can say that within 2 weeks or so I wasn't so despondent and bleak.   I actually can say that I became euphoric and felt there was more to life than justing working, eating and sleeping.  I began to notice that I became very hyper and almost manic.  I started to snap at my family and employees (I'm told more than usual), and develpoed palpitations, hypertension, ringing in the ears, dry mouth, frequent need to urinate, horrible neck, and upper back pain, and difficulty falling asleep (which is already a know cause for depression...imagine that!  I was cut fromm 300 to 150mg and noticed 50% less pain.  Two days ago I quit cold turkey (per my Dr), and I HAVE NO NECK PAIN ANYMORE!  What is also odd is that I still have a feeling of euphoria, but less anxiety.  Maybe I never needed the drug, it just could have been a rocky time in my life.  There is so much evidence regarding the placebo effect.  I hope that this is the case.  If my depression returns, I will believe that it was truly the wellbutrin than helped.  I am going to attempt Buspar for my anxiety.  I'll comment in a few months if anyone is interested.

171$Depression$1/2/2012 8:48:46 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Not sure why people say it makes the anxiety worse. I actually was having bad anxiety before i started it and have been on it a few wks and anxiety decreased some. But i imagine it will affect different people differently. Took my stomach a long time to adjust to new meds even taking with food but its improved after about 2 wks now. Sleeping has still been trouble to stabilize but i haven't been taking 2nd dose at consistent same time trying to figure out what works best. Not needing as much sleep compared to before i started taking it. And the important thing if it has improved my depression-I have only been on it for about 2 or 3 wks so know it won't be fully working yet. Depression improved slightly but hard to tell if it has to do with meds or other factors of things going on in life at this time. Still hoping for the best...

Afterwords I noticed no improvement in my depression. I occassionally wondered if it might be making me feel worse. Once I stopped and it left my system, started to feel better.

My Dr tried me on every other ssri and effexor none helped. Either made it worse or cause sexual side effects. I requested bupropion cause I heard good things about it. Been on it for a week and I love it. At first had a headache and grumpy/agitated but has worn off and I feel much better. 
178$Depression$11/6/2011 9:47:00 AM$Reviewer: Better every day!, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$"   Paxil was was not working and possibly making things worse. I wanted to get away from the SSRI/SNRI meds so I suggested Wellbutrin to my doctor as an alternative. He had some reservations but started me on the 75mg immediate release Bupropion. One tablet for two days. No problems so the dose was increased to two tablets per day for the next ten days. At this point I was feeling a bit ""wired"" with some muscle twitches and difficulty sleeping. I believe these are typical with this medication. Also had a slight headache. Not real bad but always there. At this point I am wondering if this is the right medication for me. Feeling ""different"" but not really getting the relief that I wanted. I went to three tablets per day for about three weeks. Still having some issues at this point but I was seeing some benefits. Went to four tablets for the next ten days with much improvement.
   My most recent prescription was for Bupropion HCL 100mg taken three times a day. After about six weeks into this I feel much improved and confident that this medication will work well for me. Do not discount the effectiveness of this medication too quickly as there are some rough spots to get past before any benefit is seen.
   I did use low dose Klonopin to take the ""edge"" off the Bupropion. I did not need more than 1mg per day at the most and I am at a point where I believe I can stop it completely. The sleep issues have been resolved nicely with a 10mg dose of Doxepin at bedtime.
   Each individual is different as to the medications that work best. This is working for me.

With the generic, it felt as though I wasn't taking ANY medication. SO, back to the Brand Wellbutrin XL. Recently, following several years of paying THOUSANDS of dollars for BrandName, I decided to try the generic SR form. Depression, weight gain, sexual dysfunction and headaches were the only things I got from the medication. Now I'm back to BrandName Wellbutrin XL and paying a $236-CoPay each month. I DO NOT understand the FDA's approval for the generic forms of Wellbutrin. "

All of a sudden the insurance company would no longer pay for it and I was forced to use the generic, Bupropion.  Found myself sinking deeper and deeper into my depression without understanding why until I read a few articles about the ineffectiveness of Bupropior vs Wellbutrin.

193$Depression$4/26/2011 3:16:07 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$2$"This drug reminds me of amphetamine. My doc said to take 150mg each of the first four days, then 300mg per day. I didn't notice much of anything at all the first there days, but on the fourth day, I woke up at 4:00, feeling cranked up, then I thought I'd go ahead and take the fourth day's dose. That last dose was horrible. It felt like I had drunk a couple of posts of black coffee after missing sleep for about a week.

I troopered on and increased my dose to 300mgs, thinking I was just going through an acclimation period. Wrong! I had all the irritable side effects, the tinnitus, the insomnia. It was very similar to speed except without the horrible crash during the wearoff.

Finally, I called my doc and told her it was no good. She said I could cut the pills in half but that they would no longer be SR since the innards would be exposed. On the 75mg twice a day dose, sometimes I thought I was doing all right. But then the next day would be awful again, especially the insomnia. I cut the pills again, down to 37.5 mg twice a day, and I feel almost nothing except tinnitus and sometimes insomnia, but not as bad. There's no good side on this low dose, however. One good thing, unlike SSRIs, there's no ejaculatory disfunction on this drug. It even makes you sort of horny."
194$Depression$4/14/2011 2:54:00 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I started burpropion (generic version of Wellbutrin) almost a year ago after a tragic suicide left me with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was first prescribed Celexa which was great, but I had gained weight. So a few months later, my doc prescribed me Bupropion in addition. I was on 10mg/once a day Celexa and then prescribed 150mg/twice a day Bupropion. I had horrible side effects from the Bupropion- I felt drunk, sea sick, nervous, loss of appetite, couldn't sleep, woke up often in the night etc.  The 150mg/twice a day proved to be too much, and actually caused more anxiety than I started with. Sometimes going for a higher dose isn't the right answer. I went down to once a day dose of 150mg and it was magic! Together with celexa, I have gotten a hold of my depression/anxiety/OCD/PTSD. And, I have lost the 10 lbs I gained when first starting Celexa- yipee! If considering, or becoming discouraged with this drug- try out lower doses! Also- I'd suggest giving any SSRI medication at least 2 months to let the side effects wear off. I have absolutely no side effects now, and happy as can be!
196$Depression$4/10/2011 1:40:40 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$I started taking this 3 weeks ago for depression/anxiety. It really helped my concentration but it also kept me up all night every night that i took it because I had way too much energy. Also, if I had any caffeine, my heart would be pounding and my hands shaking to the point where it was embarrassing to try to hold a pen. I could definitely see this helping anyone for weight loss since I didn't want to eat anything even when I was hungry. But for anxiety, it made mine much worse. I also felt completely in my head and unable to control myself. I was having a difficult time controlling what came out of my mouth, which is scary in the office...i had to stop taking it. I do wonder if the non generic would have been better, but my insurance would only pay for the generic.

199$Depression$3/22/2011 12:27:04 PM$Reviewer: Leighann maines, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking Bupropion for little over a month (100mg 2x a day), and I have to say it has done wonders for me. I no longer have morbid thoughts or feel miserable all the time. I have noticed that when I'm close to my menstrual cycle I experience intense agitation, but aside from that I haven't experienced any other side effects. It has no sexual side effects at all which is fantastic. I'm so glad I've finally found something that works after taking every SSRI under the sun to no avail. My advice to anyone taking it is please wait a full month before you decide it isn't working (extenuating circumstances aside like if your suffering severe side effects then by all means consult your doctor) but I have felt better and better everyday since taking it. This has been my wonder drug and has given me my life back. I can concentrate better and have gotten my motivation back to pursue my personal goals in life. I hope everyone has the same results as I did. If you haven't don't give up there is something out there that can help you, and it is so worth it in the end.

Also have had bad ringing in ears periodiocally and can't stop clenching my jaw. finally realized what was making me do it.Bad dreams at night but might not be from this.

204$Depression$2/23/2011 11:22:40 PM$Reviewer: violet, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$"I have been taking for 1 week exactly today. I haven't really noticed any big differences except this week would've been my BIG mood swing time of the month and I didn't have any. It is definitely cutting down my appetite which is great, as a result of my depression I was dwelling on situations and would eat or drink late at night and basically binge on snacks. I will take my 30 days dose and if I notice any bad side effects (like hair loss, ringing in ears as I have read on here) I will request to be changed to wellbutrin which who knows if my insurance will cover. I am going to Mexico in 2 weeks and they sell the brand name Wellbutrin for $100 a bottle with no prescription needed, I guess I will see if my insurance will cover it first. I've taken it in the past and my sex drive multiplied by 10 which was great as my depression had diminished my sex drive and general interest in anything. So far Buproprion hasn't changed sex drive but it's only been a week."

I am in less pain and no longer dwell on things for long periods of time. There was some feelings of agitation for a couple hours after taking a dose at first, but this passed after about two weeks. I sometimes have a light ringing in my ears, and I seem to get overly excited from time to time (a new feeling), a small price to pay for feeling better. Recommend starting with a very small dose and SLOWLY building up, that's what I did.

After a week of this medication, my doc wanted me to up the dosage to 2 pills daily. During my very first day of taking this medication I had adverse reactions.  My heart beat increased and I felt somewhat anxious.  Several days later I began taking the 2 pills per day as prescribed.  I noticed my neck began itching and had red blotchy spots appeared. Not only that but I became quite irritated and my husband said I was ""a bear"" while on this stuff. One of the most unpleasant effects was that I began ""clenching"" my teeth together and noticed an awareness in my teeth I'd never experienced before. This alarmed me so I called my dr's office. The nurse suggested I go back down to one pill again and come back in and see the doctor.  I have since been taking Sertraline (generic of Zoloft) with less adverse effects.  I have been on it now for almost 3 weeks and it's already much better than the Wellbutrin SR ever was.  The only good thing about this med is that it didn't have any bad sexual side effects...if anything it increased sexual desire.  But the bad far outweighed the good on this one."

I guess my beginning was uneventful, because I don't recall any adverse reactions. In retrospect, I did have vivid bad dreams and night sweats that I attributed to menopause. At my last check up my doctor suggested that maybe I didn't need this drug anymore. We tapered from 100 mg. a day to 100 every other day, t0 100 every third day.  I have not been on any for about two weeks.  Starting on the day I reduced I have had gastrointestinal symptoms I never expected-- slight nausea, severe diarhea, burning in the top left of my abdomen, extreme thirst, tiredness, a bit of a headache.  I don't really think there have been psychological withdrawal symtoms, except that I find myself thinking that what I really am feeling gastrointestinally are signs of some horrible fatal illness (anxiety?). So, this has been going on for about 4 weeks. Has anyone else had withdrawal symtoms like this?

I have been on several medications for depression and I have found that in my case it wasn't so much the drug as it was the dosage and combination of drugs.  Granted I have been diagnoses with major depression, as well as cancer, so the multi drug treatment isn't always for everyone.

Before Bupropion I was glued to my couch feeling bad for myself. I ramped up to 150mg before I really got motivated because I was also on Citalopram. With the motivation came high anxiety and clenching of my teeth which gave me headaches. I felt like I was on drugs all the time.

Finally, we reduced the Citalopram to 5mg, reduced Bupropion SL to 100mg and added a little (2.5mg)of Zyprexa.  Now I'm human again and I don't feel like I'm on drugs.

Warnings: Zyprexa has caused me to gain weight but worth not feeling like I'm on drugs. One last thing.  I've tried several drugs and none got rid of the ringing in my ears.  I just humm to it instead."

Normal activities, like walking through the grocery store, make me sweat, its embarassing. Also, I have to take it as soon as I wake up , or I WILL NOT SLEEP!

I have been on the Bupropion for 8 days and so far I like it.  I had no energy for my 3 year old or my fiance and work was draining me every day.  I have more energy which is what I was going for and I don't feel tired.  I do take a 25mg of Trazadone to help me sleep and it seems to work good with the Bupropion.  I have noticed a loss of appetite which isn't bad but when I'm busy I forget to eat.  Had sweats for two nights but those are gone.  Dry mouth and a little dizziness the morning after drinking alcohol.  I think I will stay on it for a while because it seems to be working.

269$Depression$11/20/2009 7:34:52 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I had a terrible reaction to bupropion (generic) and stopped taking it after 3 days. My health care provider prescribed it in addition to fluoxetine, which helped with my symptoms but made me feel drowsy and lethargic. On the bupropion (150mg SR in the morning) I couldn't sleep, I was jumpy, my brain felt like I was full of electrical zaps. I felt less inhibited, but this was actually a bad thing -- I didn't trust myself to know what was and wasn't appropriate to say or do. It was kind of terrifying, actually. I felt like I just wanted my self back. I can tell I would have lost weight quickly if I had stayed on it for any length of time. I was way overstimulated by it. Wished it had worked out, but it most definitely wasn't for me. Right now I'm on a very low dose of fluoxetine (10mg) to minimize side effects. Hoping to get off of it completely, but at least it helps when I need it without messing me up that much.

302$Depression$4/8/2009 9:56:53 PM$Reviewer: sexless, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$"I have had sexual side effects, but so far I can't tell how severe they may be as my body may still be adjusting to the drug. Initially, and still (after 2 months), I noticed that while I can reach a physical climax and ejaculate without any problem (unlike with Prozac where this had become difficult), the ""rush"" felt in the brain is missing -- no toe-curling reaction that leads to the afterglow feeling. More of a ""that's it?"", kissing your sister kind of feeling.

Recently, I have noticed a complete loss of libido - no interest in sexual stimuli that is usually a turn-on. I don't know if this is bupropion-related or not; I don't see sexual side effects listed at this website. In fact the reason I switched from prozac to bupropion was to reduce sexual dysfunction, which it has to some extent.

I wonder if anyone else has experienced these symptoms?"

While lying in bed trying to fall alseep, for no apparent reason I had the worst anxiety attack I have ever had.  I had the most horrifying and disturbing thoughts - things I am not capable of doing to those I love.  My husband sat up with me until I was finally able to sleep.  I stopped taking the drug immediately and felt better in a day or two.  It was extremely scary - felt like a ""bad trip"" I had once as a teen.  I won't take another anti depressant after that.

314$Depression$1/1/2009 10:41:44 PM$Reviewer: SomethingsGottaGive, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$Well when takin alone, this stuff really works.  I tried every other drug before this one, and I must say this was the easiest for me to adapt to in regards to side effects.  However I was also givin Lorazepam with it which I ended up abusing and then even using alcohol and marijuana on top of it.  My advice would be to just take the bupropron sr alone with nothing else.  Alcohol and marijuana do not mix well with this.  I was feeling great after two weeks of taking this med but then started smoking pot again, and within 2 days I was back to my depressed self.  I stopped the lorazepam because I felt tired all the time and bupropion is supposed to make me wired, not tired.  So in the end, I realized to get better, I would have to ditch all my bad habits, and subtitute them with this drug, bupropion.  If you smoke pot or drink or do any other kinda narcotics, I would suggest not doing them at all if you truly want to get the full benefit of this medication.

I used a generic non timed release and found I actually experienced withdrawal symptoms between doses.

Even though I only used drug for a few weeks I have never had an urge for another cigarette and that was about 5 years ago.

When the SR and XL came out, I was switched to those and continued to do well. Now that BCBS won't pay except for generic, I went on Budeprion and had to double the dosage to get the same effectiveness. I never had panic attacks before but they started and I thought they were due to birth control pills I began taking to deal with bleeding problems. THEN, I did mail order and they gave me BUPROPION (not Budeprion) - it went rapidly downhill from there to the point where thoughts of harming myself occurred for the 1st time in years. Realized they gave me even the wrong generic - note the syllables - had to call my doc, the insurance, cuz it would've been $125. Still having problems with insurance cuz of mail order - never gonna do that again! I still have problems with any generic and wish the brand name was affordable.

I have been on the drug for 2 years and during that time span, it's probably happened 10 times. The morning after I have had a drink or two, I will wake up in bed with the room spinning violently, feeling like I have been slammed onto the floor, and I have to get up and stumble dizzily to the bathroom in order to get sick. My doctor said that you can still drink while taking this medication, but that it will increase the effects of alcohol- so you feel drunker on less booze. However, the vertigo has increased ever since I increased my dosage to recover from S.A.D. Now, I've woken up with vertigo twice in the past week. I think I need to not drink any alcohol for a couple weeks to see if it gets better.

However, I am glad that I started taking it, because Bupropion has been very helpful in treating my depression and has allowed me to do better at work, as well as given me the energy to pursue the things I know I want out of life."

Within about 5 or 6 weeks these side effects subsided and I felt much better.  My doctor presribed a sleeping aid with it as well which helped with the insomnia.  I was able to wean myself off the sleeping aid after two months and have only had a few bouts of insomnia since.  The weight loss, increased sex drive and overall feeling of well being have been worth toughing my way through the side effects in the beginning.  I was on prozac for two years before this drug and I am most definitely thankful I switched to buproprion sr.

I was always either so sad that I could barely function, or I was angry and screaming at everyone! When I first started this med I had severe headaches every day, and had a lot of trouble sleeping at night (waking up about every hour).  But those side-effects went away after about 3 weeks. I'm glad I stuck it out because I'm feeling so much better now. I'm still sad and a little angry that I've lost my mother, but the mood swings have disappeared. It's also helped me lose weight & although I haven't quit smoking, I only smoke about half as much.

I had the tests and the doctor said he would like them to be twice as high as they were for ""my condition"" so he put me on wellbutrin. I really have no idea why he didnt give me thyroid meds. Ive been on this drug for 3 weeks and it worsened some conditions but made some worse. I feel like my body is ready is ready to go in the morning with a rush of energy, but i can barely stay awake after getting up. My memory loss has worsened dramatically. I can not hold a thought for more than 5 minutes.My hands and body seem to weaken randomly and begin shaking like crazy. I am going to an endocrinologist tomorrow to see what he says.

I still struggle with those feelings, but Wellbutrin XL (or the generic now) has helped immensely.  I'm on a 300mg/day dosage which I take in the morning.  It has allowed me to get past the feelings of worthlessness and near-paralyzing sadness.  

The only problems I've had with Wellbutrin is a reduction in my sex drive, an infrequent side effect of this drug. Maybe I'm just lucky.  I also highly recommend not stopping usage of this quickly.  I stopped for a couple weeks then started up again, only to have my internal chemistry sent into a tailspin.  For almost three weeks after, I had to deal with severe anxiety, sadness, depression, almost to the point where I needed to visit the local emergency room.  My system has since re-balanced, but I highly recommend not following in my footsteps.  Continue using or talk to your doctor before cessation.  "

Prior to it, I tried every SSRI and newer drugs like Cymbalta. Wellbutrin is the only drug for depression that I could live with. ALL the others cause sexual problems, weight gain, sleepiness, fatique and still don't get rid of all the depression. One doctor added Zyprexa to the SSRIs I was taking and I put on 40 pounds! Getting off SSRIs are tough too. Electric shocks felt in my head and lights. Would never ever go back to them. Wellbutrin actually caused a boost in libido, weight loss and high energy. If I had it to do over again, Wellbutrin XL would be the starting med, not the SSRI classes. Think about it this way: If you're depressed now, how much more will you be when you lose interest in sex, gain weight, fall asleep at work, home, doctor's waiting room and have no energy to do anything? Those are the downsides of the SSRI class of meds. For me, they made my life worse. I am rarely depressed now and take nothing else for it but an occasional Xanax if in a highly stressful situation at work. I lost all the weight I gained, hike 5+ miles on weekends, kayak and have a normal sex life. Please give Wellbutrin a try and if it doesn't work after a month or so, then try the others.

Didn't make much of a difference, thought it was me. I went off that for a while and thought I just had to live with depression. 

Recently it started affecting me even more severely, so I looked into other medications. Welbutrin (bupropion) sounded like it was worth a try, since it affects dopamine receptors, not serotonin. I started it when I was 24, and what a difference it has made! It's been about a year now, and I can say that I actually feel normal. There is no long this yawning black hole over every day. There are still some days when I am sad, but it's relatively easy to get over it. The only bad thing about this drug was during the first 2 weeks of taking it: I had really bad insomnia, it was horrible. I had to take sleep aids every night. But that did eventually go away, now I sleep fine. 

Some people have said this drug is awful and no one should take it because it makes them super anxious/nervous/irritable, etc. Well that means it's probably the wrong drug for you. I would say, have an open mind, work with your doctor, and try different treatments until you find the one that works for you. This definitely worked for me, it has been a God send. "

In the past, I've used others that were more effective, but had such bad side effects that I had to quit them. Overall, I think this takes the basic depression from about a constant 8 down to a constant 3 or 4.    There have been many episodes of being quite depressed while on it.  

Frankly, I'd rather take it than try other things.  I've used so many over the years, and I'm tired of experimenting.  "

426$Depression$4/28/2019 10:05:23 PM$Reviewer: Jo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Background: 
I’ve experienced depression on and off since I was 14. In university, I was a physics major, which was challenging and engaging, but could also be soul-crushingly hard. Even getting slightly behind would leave me completely overwhelmed struggling to catch up. Multiple times I fell into a hole of deep depression, binging/bulimia. 

Despite all this, I got hired to do my dream job the summer before senior year. When I got back to school however, I started slipping back into depression. Everything in my life was good, so I couldn’t understand why I was still depressed. At this point I had tried every non-medication treatment under the sun: therapy, meditation, journaling, etc. There are so many things they say you should do when you’re depressed (get out of the house, exercise, challenge negative thoughts, engage your mind in a task, etc.), but for me it was almost impossible to do these things when my brain was telling me I couldn’t even get out of bed. I decided to see a psychiatrist. 

Experience on medication: 
I I got lucky that Wellbutrin was the first thing my clinician prescribed me — bc I genuinely felt a difference within the first day. Tasks no longer seem insurmountable, and I can easily challenge my negative thoughts or lack of motivation. 

I take 150mg and have actually been able to overcome lifelong insomnia with the help of a very consistent bedtime routine (dim lights, shower, make tea, do a couple Duolingo lessons, put meds on my bedside table, and watch an ASMR video). My alcohol tolerance is somewhat lower than before, but it’s not bothersome. The most interesting side effect is that while in most situations it keeps my emotions quite even-keeled, when I am watching a show, concert, movie, or other art form, I can become moved to tears by it — in a good way! Maybe this sounds silly, but I actually feel like I get to more fully experience what it means to be human now. Anyway, I can’t recommend Wellbutrin highly enough."

Needless to say it flat lined my libedo.  Sure hope the wellbutrin helps with that.

I took it a few years ago in conjunction with therapy and it worked wonders- motivated, happy,less stressed. I also don't really remember any side effects. Since I've started taking it again (for depression/ADD/SAD)I haven't been feeling too much of a difference, in fact I have felt more easily moved to tears, moodier, still stressed, and even less social. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not currently in therapy, if it's interacting with my birth control, or if I just need to wait a few more weeks. Also side effects- first few weeks I would get very anxious and my hands would shake very badly which affected my job (dog grooming)that has since subsided and isn't as much of an issue. Loss of appetite, which isn't horrible but it gives me a weird feeling in my stomach, not nausea, almost feels like hunger but eating doesn't help. This has also gotten a bit better as time goes by.

It is unlike any of the dozens of other antidepressants I've taken over the years--it gives me energy and makes it easier to get up in the morning!  Please note that I only take the brand-name of this drug--I had severe reactions to the generic version (complete meltdown). I took the brand name for many years with no problem, but the generic felt like a completely different drug.  In reading these reviews, I wonder how many of the people with severe reactions were taking the generic version opposed to the brand name. According to my doctor, I have severe side effects to the buffering agents used in many medications. Just wanted to put that out there for consideration.

During inpatient at a psych ward, the psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin SR. I've been on it less than a month and it's definitely working! I have so much more energy and motivation. It did increase my anxiety and I had quite a few of the side effects. I stuck through them and glad I did. I feel like such a weight is off my shoulders! My whole family/friends noticed a major difference in me. To all those complaining about side effects: every medication will have them. If you are truly eager to let a medication do it's job, you need to be taking it for AT LEAST 2 weeks to see the full effect. Don't be quick to give up on this medication. Suck it up, stick through it, and it will definitely pay off in the end. I am extremely happy with this medication so far.

490$Depression$10/11/2012 3:49:12 PM$Reviewer: TLo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been on Wellbutrin for over 2 weeks now - 300mg for depression in dealing with my divorce.  At first, I did experience slight headaches and a ""spaced out"" sort of feeling but it only lasted a few days. I've I fall asleep fast but do wake up around 3:00 am or so but after like 20 minutes I'm back asleep. I think if you limit caffeine intake (soda, coffee, etc.)you should be fine. Been having some vivid dreams but they're not a big deal, more interesting than anything else. Appetite has decreased -lost 5 lbs in just over 2 weeks)which is fine by me! Dry mouth, yes, but just drink more water. It's good for you anyway. Constipation? Yes, but just eat an apple or more veggies/fiber.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and feel healthier in general. Mood has lifted,able to focus more at work, energy level has increased, going to the gym more -outlook is much brighter.  Highly recommend this drug."

I have been taking generic and then brand name Wellbutrin for about 9 months and although it has not helped much with my mood I am continuing to take it.  It has helped with energy levels although I have difficulty sleeping and need to take a sleep aid every night in order to sleep through the night.  I also have dry mouth from it which was really awful at a higher dose (450mg) and did have funny feelings in my head when trying to go to sleep at that dose.  Adjusting to the Bupropion I did experience heart racing, et cetera.  Right now I am taking 200mg.  I continue to take it because I don't want to lose the effect of not struggling to stay awake all the time.  The Bupropion/Wellbutrin also helped me to lose 40 - 50 lbs over a period of 9 months
493$Depression$8/22/2012 7:57:28 PM$Reviewer: La La, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been taking this medication for about two weeks and it works for me.  I was taking Wellbutrin XL, but my doctor changed me to SR 150mg twice a day.  My sex drive has been GREAT!! I do get jitters and rapid heart beat every now and then and some constipation, but overall I feel good. My depression is getting better, but I know what would also help is to stop worrying so much about stuff I cannot control.  I start therapy next week and I think that will really make me feel better also. Hope this helps someone.

I have had no side affects at all besides loss of appetite and weight loss (8 lbs so far!) which I view as a bonus.  It helps me sleep as I am prone to insomnia when I am depressed.  It's been almost a year and a half since I've had a full week where I wasn't up all night long at least 1 night and up to 3 nights a week until I started this med.  It has eliminated my anxious feelings.  I only wish I would have went to the Dr. and been put on this earlier.

I have no appetite what-so-ever (fine with me!), but feel anxious and jittery and have trouble falling asleep. I have much more energy, but feel nauseous and dizzy very often. I have not been on the drug long enough for the side-effects to subside, so I am toughing it out. From what I've read, the benefits most often outweigh the side-effects, and it's worth it to wait 4-6 weeks.
499$Depression$7/3/2012 11:50:00 PM$Reviewer: parsonsjo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$In a two week period I went from trying to control my depression to a worsening depression/psychiatric conditions, unusual behavior changes, thoughts and other mental/mood changes (including new/worsening anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, irritability, hostile/angry feelings, impulsive actions, severe restlessness, very rapid speech). I didn't care about anything or anyone. I was very hostile, angry, and snapped and anything. I reached a point where I wanted to put my fist thru someones face and I was waiting for someone to piss me off. This drug made my PTSD overwhelming and I was seeing things and the images of the warzone was always popping up. I was seeing the flesh rotting of peoples faces. Worms, maggots, snakes crawling out of thiers eyes, nose, ears & mouth as I was talking and looking/ talking right them. My night terror dreams left me screaming until I would wake my hearing impaired wife up. I lost over 25 lbs and nearly lost my mind with this medication. My wife, son and daughter were in constant fear of setting me off. I wouldn't recommend to medication to anyone. It was like my brain was on fire and my thoughts were racing a 1,000 mph. I so badly want to crash my truck in a brick wall at 120 mph to put a end to this madness. I have been taking meds for over 9+ years to treat my depression, socail phoia, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping. I feel that after a little two weeks of taking this pill at 150mg twice aday that my menatl state is even worse then ever before. This medication has triggered some veterns with PTSD to kill and kill themself. If you have PTSD or know someone who does please stay away form it.

Two days later I woke up with hives all over again and couldn't breathe. Went to ER. got beter. This was a severe allergic reaction to Wellbutrin. Very scary. It worked very good for my appetite.

507$Depression$1/24/2012 9:43:58 AM$Reviewer: COF momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking the generic form of this med in August 2010.  Originally, it was given to me to help with anxiety and overall being overtaxed with the cares of life.  It took about 2 weeks to really start feeling a change.  I typically have seasonal affective disorder; so, this medicine was extremely helpful during the fall and winter months.  I stopped noticing much of an impact in the spring; so, I gradually took myself off of it and did fine through the summer.  I went back on it in September 2011 when I felt the symptoms of depression and anxiety start to creep back up on me.  In the winter, I could gain 20 pounds EASILY but since I started taking this medicine, I have lost 30 pounds and actually feel motivated to take better care of myself (which is required to take the best care of my family).  Overall, this medicine has been very effective for me.  The only drawbacks I can see are that, after a while, I stopped seeing any effects of it (during the warmer months).  I also had extreme bouts of sweating and some insomnia.  I have some occasional dizziness as well.  But as infrequently as I have any of these side effects, this medicine is still very much worth my time and money.
508$Depression$1/7/2012 2:53:57 PM$Reviewer: sunshinesmiles, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$4$I personally have been taking this medication for almost 4wks. The beginning was fine, and just the waiting game for it to kick in. At about 3wks I started feeling more than just the dry mouth, the headaches were horrible a few hours into the med, been having to take laxatives for the constipation, which at 21 is a horrid reality. The kicker for me is the nausea the constant cruddy stomach feeling, I dont eat because I am not hungry, but then the pain worsens as it generally does when you dont eat. If I try eating, I feel sicker to my stomach afterward. The dr just upped my med from 100mg 2x day (am,pm) to 150mg 2x day, I am praying (and I am not religious) that this gets better. I'll update later on if symptoms clear up. best of luck everyone.

Big mistake! After about a month off it I felt the major depression coming back. The most prominent side effects I have noticed are terrible shakes and a ""spacey head"" feeling. The last time I was taking this they went away after close to 6 weeks. They problem is the shakes get so bad at times I can't even write. It's frustrating. But as treatment for depression goes, I find it to be a fairly good drug."

I was very nervous to start taking it after reading all of the horror stories about side effects. However I had no bad side effects other than some constipation and it made me tired. I was on Lexapro for a little over a year before this and while it did help, it made me very zombie like and emotionless. And after awhile it didn't seem like it was helping anymore. (weaning off Lexapro is not fun either!) I know it's too early to tell if the medicine is working or not but I notice that I am happier. Most things I used to cry about don't upset me anymore. I can actually deal with a stressful situation instead of giving in to my emotions. I am supposed to up the dose to 150 mg twice a day in a few weeks so things may change but so far so good!

I take 150 mg twice a day. I can honestly say that so far it has improved my daily attitude and certainly is helping me deal with my depression.  I also have experienced some weight loss, and some constipation.  At first this medication gave me cotton mouth as well, but I am into week 3 and that seems to have deteriorated.  
Even some of my longtime co-workers notice a difference in my attitude.  Also I think I myself am trying to change the way I think and this medication only helps me to do that.  I sleep better than  I did before taking this, and the dreams like other people have said are very vivid.  They aren't nightmares but they are easy to recall.  Hope this helps for some of you with worries about taking this.  May not be for everyone, but so far it has worked well for me."

I suffered a severe neck injury( 3 surgeries) that rendered me disabled way before my time. Became depressed after I had to resign my job and give up golf and other activities that I loved. I tried several other meds but between the constant pain of my injury and the depression I could barely get out of bed. My Dr. put me on wellbutrin sr 100 mg twice daily at first and it helped for awhile before I fell back into a rut. Then he suggested 100 mg prestiq ALONG with the wellbutrin and everything just clicked. I know that this may be an strange combo but I also know that it has worked wonders for me ! I have proof every morning as my first hour of the day is still brutal until the medication takes hold. I now have the energy and resilience to face each day in a positive manor. A little wordy here but if I can help just one person it's worth the extra typing. I now have a renewed and much needed energy level and feel light years better than I had before.

It worked excellent for me. However, last week (7 days ago exactly) I switched to Wellbutrin SR, 100mg in am and 100mg in pm, secondary to significant sexual difficulties experienced with Zoloft. I started Wellbutrin SR to also treat ADHD, hoping that it was a ""bang for my buck"" type med. As of this past week I have been experiencing side effects of agitation, shakiness, dizziness, and emotional. At the same time I have been significantly functional completing my daily tasks and then some. I have been able to go to BJ's and not feel overwhelmed and actually focus on my grocery list!!! One of the major issues I am experiencing is a very odd ""electrical shock"" type feeling upon movement. I have experienced this before if I missed several doses of the Zoloft, so I am wondering since I have recently switched, is this the side effect of not having Zoloft in my system or the Wellbutrin SR?

I noticed jitters and just a overall sicky feeling in my head. i take (100mg 2x) 1 in am than 1 in pm. i lost 3 lbs already. which i havent had constipation like most patients. i notice energy after my head feels better later in day after am pill. but i normally have to take a nap in mid afternoon to help with the jitters and sick feeling. I have slept better not sleeping all 12 hrs of day away like in last yr. I get up and start the day with energy for house chores but only have the energy till i take the am pill than I seem to loose the energy and the jitters and shakes come. i hope the best on this and pray the side effect goes away like today but i understand takes time. I do believe with losing 3lbs already and energy increase this will work out. Also I have to say Im a bit more short temper with wellbutrin right now too. Feel that should go away too. Im to stay on 2x 100mg until further doc. tappt. in next 4wks. I will update after my appt. I hope to help others believe me I have switched it up 3 time in one yr. before going on effexor. now im on another path to try and turn around bad side effects of weight gaining from effexor.

However, Wellbutrin made me constipated and dizzy, gave me extreme dry mouth and headaches, and made me feel feverish and exhausted for about two hours a day, every day. Worst of all, it made me incredibly anxious and nervous. It may have actually made me feel worse. After a month, I went back to my Dr and I've been off of it for a week and a half. Now I'm vomiting and I'm even more constipated than I was before.

I had few side effects in the beginning but they subsided. Recently I feel very very tired within about 45 minutes of taking it. I have looked for side effects of this nature but haven't found any. All in all I think it works great. All my life medications have had the opposite affect on me. For example, Nyquil wakes me rather than helping me sleep. I think for those who may have this same problem may have the same affects of tiredness like I have had with it.

I was on tricyclics for a while in my late 20s (horrible side effects), and then the SSRIs (first Lexapro, then Celexa). The Lexapro had NO effect on me. The 20-mg Celexa made me sleep 12-14 hours a day (seriously), gained 7 pound in 1 week (ug), lost my motivation, lost what was left of my sex drive, and made me feel quite drugged. I insisted that my doc let me try Welbutrin. He put me on 75 mg generic Welbutrin SR. I feel fantastic! My energy is back, I am starting to get bursts of happiness, I smile more, my sex drive is creeping back, and I lost a couple pounds without trying.
I am SO happy that this drug is around because talk therapy and exercise was not enough for me. Depression is a genetic disorder that causes chemical imbalances in the brain. So you have to keep trying different meds - in my case, it was an imbalance in norepinephrine and dopamine, which is was Welbutrin treats."

This drug has turned my life around and is working better then I ever thought it would. Before taking the drug I was always tired, lazy, and just really not myself. I know the reasons why I felt like this I had a few pretty horrible personal issues and I just kept dwelling on them. Believe it or not this drug has given me my life back. I will tell you right now your sleeping pattern will change 100%. You will not sleep as well as you normally would but you also don't feel tired because you didn't sleep that well. For example I could sleep 8 hours before the drug now I only sleep 6 but have the energy like I slept 10 and the mood that all is well. THIS IS KEY!!! I HIGHLY SUGGEST you talk to your doctor and have him prescribe you e Klonopin or Xanex. I shouldn't say that but for my situation this drug can cause anxiety because it is a stimulant and every now and then you may need a benzo to calm down. Highly reccomend the combination of Wellbutrin and a benzo if your life is in the dumps at the moment

548$Depression$10/26/2010 9:46:45 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I have taken Wellbutrin SR up until about one year ago.  I was originally taking 300 mg when I first started using it about five years ago.  I really liked the way it helped with my depression.  However, I did notice an increase in anxiety with it, and the headaches were awful.  I took it for about four years and during that time felt better but sleep problems, headaches and anxiety were issues.  I cut my dosage down to 100 mg daily last year and added Zoloft 100 mg daily.  Headaches did not improve and overall feeling of well being decreased.  I am now off Wellbutrin and just on Zoloft 100 mg daily. Since I stopped taking Wellbutrin I've gained 20 pounds (I had lost 50 pounds over the four year period I took it, which I loved!).  Anyway, I'm debating taking the Wellbutrin again because I feel less depressed on it, and have more energy but I hate the thought of going back to severe headaches and more trouble sleeping (even though I have headaches and trouble sleeping all the time due to Fibromyalgia).  I do take clorazepate to help sleep and that has worked nicely without the hangover feeling of other sleep meds.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to deal with the headaches if I start taking the Wellbutrin again???  Thanks!

I was very depressed due to my divorce and anxiety ridden along with the fact that I'm A.D.D. This medication started working the next day. I don't feel depressed anymore, I have tons of energy and have a positive outlook. I'm more productive at work and it's helped me focus (A.D.D.). I'm glad I don't have to take Vyvanse anymore. I don't like stimulants. The only thing I've experienced as far as side effects, is a sore throat. But not too bad, the benefits definitely outweigh the side effects.

565$Depression$5/29/2010 6:20:12 PM$Reviewer: quatchisaurusrex, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$4$4$"I first tried Wellbutrin about a year and a half ago for a clinical trial, and it was pretty bad: the doctors had me start at 150mg and tried to push it up to the max dose in about a month, and then threw on a mystery drug (which turned out to be Lexapro) on the side for another two months. That was rough: the first few days of just Wellbutrin, I was an insomniac. It got better with time, but when Lexapro got added to my ""treatment"", I became such a zombie that I failed my classes that term. I was headachey, couldn't move, didn't want to...it was worse than my depression.

Now my doc convinced me to retry Wellbutrin, so I've been taking 75mg for the past couple of weeks. It's not bad. The first couple of days it felt like I was on speed or something because I was really hyper and jittery, but it's calmed down. The only thing I really notice is that I don't fall asleep until about 2 in the morning, and I sleep through my alarm clock (9am). I also had headaches for a couple days as well, but I can't blame that or anything else solely on Wellbutrin, as I'm taking BC along with it, and it's allergy season and I get really headachey during that. 

I'm a bit disappointed in the reviews I've found here though: some of you aren't giving your body enough time to get used to it before you start ranting about how you're going to get off it. Obviously if it's put you in the hospital already then yeah, you should find something else, but for the rest of you complaining about not being able to sleep/think/whatever since you started three days ago...BE PATIENT!"

I experienced loss of libido with Lexapro so I talked to my Dr. about changing meds.  While I don't know how it has made a difference in my libido, I have found that I have more energy, more focused, happier.  I even laugh at myself now.  I didn't expect this medicine to work so quickly, but it is almost amazing.  The first 3 days I took it only once in the morning and then on the 4th day in the morning and evenings.  As far as side affects, the first 2 days felt some initial stomach discomfort, but this has passed.  Also when I increased my dose as instructed to twice a day, I noticed that at bedtime I was very awake, but not to the point where I couldn't fall asleep.  Also, the first two days of increased dosage I had disturbing dreams, but those two have stopped.  Also, I found it has curved my need to smoke meaning I smoke a lot less often.  Overall, I am pleased with this medicine and hopes it continues to work this well for me.

Initially my dose was titrated up to 300mg per day but I found I became very agitated and anxious at this dose and my doctor and I slowly decreased the dose to 150mg a day about 9 years ago which is the dose I have maintained. I found that I didn't have any crashes on Wellbutrin SR and I didn't feel depressed anymore. However I am a smoker and I never felt the urge to quit smoking or any reduction in my craving for cigarettes. This feeling of well-being continued until March of this year when a fill-in doctor prescribed 150mg a day of Wellbutrin XL instead of Wellbutrin SR.  Gradually over the last 3 months I have become more depressed and occasionally have suicidal thoughts. This surprised me when I started feeling this way again as there seemed to be no reason for it until I remembered that the doctor had changed my antidepressant from Wellbutrin SR to Wellbutrin XL. The drug manufacturer indicates that doses of the two drugs are equivalent and switching between them at the same dose should not result in any problems. However, in my case, I feel the dose of Wellbutrin XL would have to be increased to give me the same feeling of well-being that 150mg of Wellbutrin SR gave me. I will be switching back to Wellbutrin SR next week and expect that my feelings of depression will be history. As everyone responds to medication differently, there is no reason to believe that anyone else will experience the same effects that I did. However, it is something to consider if you are switched and find the same dose of Wellbutring XL to be not as effective as the Wellbutrin SR.
622$Depression$6/8/2009 6:45:15 PM$Reviewer: sdmlink718, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have suffered from depression and increasing anxiety for a very long time.  This is my first attempt with medication and I have had great results.  I have been on it for almost three months and I no longer cry everyday!  I am able to deal with my stress and I am able to confront issues that I am upset about instead of running away.  At first I had more panic attacks and had trouble with dizziness but that wore off after three weeks. Be careful driving for the first few weeks-I had problems with the dizziness and focusing about an hour after taking the pill. I also still have problems with my memory-forgetting important numbers and names.  I have noticed that I tend to feel anger and irritability if something is annoying me more so than without the drug.  I have lost 11 lbs so far and hope to continue with the weightloss.  I have had problems with insomnia but rememdy it with 1 Tylenol PM which helps tremendously. I quit smoking two years ago but now more than ever I can't stand the smell of cigarettes-hope I can get more accustomed to that soon.  This drug has improved my life so much-I am a completely new person and I am thankful that I decided to give it a try.
623$Depression$6/7/2009 1:13:08 AM$Reviewer: grparadox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been taking this drug for depression for 4 weeks now.  Initially, I had uncontrolled crying spells, increased energy, and loss of appetite.  Now that it has stablized, I have energy, have lost 20 bls, decreased from 2 packs to 1 pack of smokes a day, have a pretty good feeling of well being, no crying spells, my emotions are in normal range, and I am getting my libido back gradually.  I am currently taking 300 mg daily (150 mg x2).  I was taking Zoloft with Lithium before.  Now I take Lamictal for my bi-polar.  A previous review mentioned that no drug is a cure all for depression. I believe that we can manage our depression with medication and therapy.  We just have to find the right one that works for us.  Never give up hope. Never. What works for some, doesn't necessarily work for all.  That is why these forums are here, to help people.  Wellbutrin Sr, had some side effects intiially, but like the literature stated that came with my bottle, the doctor thought the effects of the drug out weighed the side effects.  I have tried several medications in the past 8 years.  At least for me, I was told to give a medication 4-6 weeks to see if it is going to work, unless you are having sever side effects.  Obvious side effects aside.  Wellbutrin is not the cure all for everyone, but it seems to be working for me pretty well.  I have my life back. I can get out of bed in the morning. I want to walk my dogs, exercise, go shopping, eat, and just plain live.  Before I did not, and attempted not to.  So best wishes to all.

625$Depression$6/2/2009 8:46:15 PM$Reviewer: keishababy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been on SSRI's for the past 5 years. I started with Zoloft after the birth of my first child, and then switched to Prozac and back to Zoloft. It worked well for me until recently. I started having anxiety attacks( which I had never had before) and I became very irritable. The doctor changed me to Wellbutrin SR, and I've been taking it for about a week. The first two days it was like I was on speed or something. I had more energy than I've had in years. I cleaned (really cleaned) my house for two days straight. Third nothing unusual, fourth day very sick (possible reaction from other medications). Today, I feel kinda foggy, jittery, and dizzy. Not sure if it is the medication or the medication with coffee. I had two cups which normally wouldn't bother me, but wondering if I shouldn't drink with this rx. So far, side effects aren't anything I can't handle. Hoping the dizziness tapers off, but hope the energy stays.
626$Depression$6/1/2009 1:01:14 AM$Reviewer: BoroGuy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$When i started taking the medicine i would have such bad days that i just wanted to be left alone. I've been taking it for about 2 months still have the insomnia(but had it before started taking it, just got worse), I still have some bad days, just no where near as bad or as many, i have noticed shortened temper where little things set me off, some lil things make me wanna cry, i am dealing with somethings a lot better, but actually started smoking more, have the jittery feeling but its manageable, have noticed i have started talking a lot more, used to be quiet(not really a good thing for me). It is a good medicine has helped a lot, just has some side effects. I am taking Budeprion SR 150mg 2x daily. Was hoping it would help me stop smoking by now, and the insomnia mixed with crazy dreams would go away but it hasn't yet. 
628$Depression$5/19/2009 11:35:55 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I was on wellbutrin for 3-4 years for depression and it worked great.  The first several weeks were hell- I was already severely depressed, and once I started the wellbutrin I couldn't eat or sleep.  So if you're about to start taking it, try to have someone in your life watching out for you, because the first few weeks can be really unpleasant.  After that it controlled my depression perfectly, and as a bonus I lost some weight.  I'm not taking it now because after several years it started to affect my cognitive abilities (couldn't think of words, etc.), and I'm on celexa instead, but wellbutrin worked so well that I might even risk the cognitive effects to go back on it.  The longest-lasting effect was not being able to stand the smell of cigarette smoke- it's been over a year since I stopped taking it, and I'm just now becoming ok with walking past people smoking on the street.

I have been taking Wellbutrin SR for 1 week now. cravings for smoking gone,I still grab for cig out of habit but get no satifaction smoking.  OMG, the depression GONE! I had the desire to do simple tasks and just counldn't before. Well, day 5 I was cleaning out cupboards and organizing trying to undo over 10 years of ""that will have to do"" cleaning. I went thru years of excuses for the way I felt.Until I was at the point of just waking up in the morning took every ounce of energy. There are the side effects,at first I felt like I was in the clouds, had the jitters, the headache and I dont sleep as well but I dont feel sleepy or tired in the day, but this is only week 1. I not sure what effects will happen over time. "

I don't feel the depression everyday as I used to and it is no where as bad as it used to be. Overall, it is great to take if you give it a chance.

635$Depression$4/1/2009 10:45:25 AM$Reviewer: stokcarr2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$If you suffer from depression AND anxiety, I would recommend taking Wellbutrin along WITH an SSRI (Prozac, Lexapro, Paxil, etc.). If you already have anxiety, Wellbutrin alone will make it worse. I took Wellbutrin for 3 years, and then started experiencing severe anxiety, heart palpitations, jitterness, etc. I went off Wellbutrin and started taking Prozac. The Prozac works, but of course then you have the weight gain and the decreased libido. I read here on WebMD that you can take Wellbutrin along with SSRI's, and it will actually increase your libido and will help control your appetite. I tried the two together, and it works! My sex drive came back within two days (yes, two days!), and my appetite has significantly decreased. I think the combination of the two (Wellbutrin and Prozac) brought me to exactly where I need to be!

For the past year I have put on ALOT of weight, which wasn't normal for me.  Since I have depression, had the weight gain, feeling fatigued and smoke, my doctor started me on 150 mg of Wellbutrin for the morning and 10 mg of Lexpro at night.  I have only been doing this for 1 week. I have noticed a decreased in appetite on some days. I haven't seen a difference or a urge to quit smoking yet, I actually may be smoking more than usual because of the following. I do have the jitters, its like I drank too much caffiene. I do see a bit of an energy increase, but I would like it to me more. My sleep is fine, but I do take Klonipin, so don't know how I would be without that. This combination has been good so far.

647$Depression$1/31/2009 9:52:36 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I have been taking generic Wellbutrin SR 300mg for just alittle over a month. I had heard only good things about it and how much everyone liked it, so I thought I'd give it a try. The first week when I was taking 150mg I had so much energy and really felt good, plus it decreased my appitite. Then I went up to 300mg and my energy level tapered off which wasn't bad, my appitite came back which wasn't good, and I was more depressed, moody, agitated..just all around a bitch. It was like I had PMS everyday and I would be mad and not really know why. So, I am now in the process of weaning myself off it taking 150mg a day instead of 300mg. I haven't really had any withdrawal problems. I guess because I haven't been on it that long. I go back to my doctor on Monday and will have her put me back on Effexor which is what I was taking before and I love it. The only reason I quit taking it was because my health insurance changed and I could no longer afford it, but I found out it comes in generic now and is alot cheaper. If anyone else has had the same problems that I have experenced on Wellbutrin please let me know, because everyone else  I know that is on it thinks it is so great and don't understand why it isn't for me.

649$Depression$1/25/2009 1:24:35 PM$Reviewer: micrograd, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I read all of the posts and found some that I could definately identify with.  I've been on Wellbutrin SR for almost 2 months.  I transitioned to this from Zoloft (taken on and off for 3-4 years).  I switched because Zoloft drastically increased my appetite and I began gaining weight.  I have had some improvements on Wellbutrin including: weight loss, increased energy, getting out of bed much easier, return of sex-drive, and more motivation.  I did have insomnia when I started the Wellbrutrin.  That has gone and I actually think I'm sleeping better than I have in years.  I have also experienced some minor upset stomach from time to time, slightly shaky hands, and weird/stressful dreams.  The only concerns I have are that I am starting to feel a little paranoid and I tear up extremely easily.  I haven't started any uncontrollable crying but I'm afraid I might.  I am having monthly check-ups with my doctor so I can voice my concerns.  I also think it is very beneficial to seek out the help of a psychologist/psychiatrist.  Overall I am pleased with the progress.  I'm very close to finishing up a PhD and this has greatly improved my productivity and motivation.  
653$Depression$1/11/2009 11:39:29 AM$Reviewer: Charity, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I am on two different depression meds. I take lexapro in the morning and wellbutrin at night time. It takes about three or four weeks to get used to the wellburtin. You will have all the side affects mentioned, but once it gets into your system it works great. All the side of effects seem to go away. I still have muscle aches every now and then. I had problems sleeping two, so my doctor put me on trazdone. It is wonderful, but you have to get a full eight hours sleep when using this drug. All the meds combined seem to be working for me. I did notice that I do have weird dreams sometimes, but overall I would change the meds. I would rather put up with my dreams then to be taking off my meds. I hope my review helps answer someone's questions.

For a while, I wasn't sure if it was helping or not, but while I've been on it, I've had fewer panic attacks and have been able to deal with stressful situations in a much more collected manner.  It has also helped with my depression symptoms (I sleep better and am less distracted).  As a full-time college student, it was important to me that I only take long-term medications with minimal warnings about missing a dose once in a while, and I've never had any problems when this happens.

Overall, I have had a positive experience with Wellbutrin and have noticed no negative side effects."

My depression has improved immensely-I have no trouble getting out of bed and being motivated for the day.  Also a bonus is the return of sexual sensitivity and libido.  I had taken Paxil at one time and it totally eliminated sexual feelings.  Have also noticed it helps considerably with weight loss.  On Paxil I gained a lot of weight.  I am on 300 mg. a day and intend to stay on it-please give it a chance if you are having side effects-they are temporary!!
674$Depression$8/16/2008 5:23:32 PM$Reviewer: applefarmer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$Nothing else I have tried has helped my depression like this - not Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, or Lexapro. And this does not have any side effects that I cannot tolerate. When you first start taking this, if it causes insomnia, shakiness, hand tremors, or nervousness - ask your Dr. to temporarily give you something to help you with these side effects so you can stick it out and stay on it for 6 weeks to see if it helps you. If my Dr. had not given me Ambien for the insomnia and Propranolol for the hand tremors, I would not have stuck with this long enough to tell that it works much better for me than anything else I have tried. Also, it is the only antidepressant that give me the side effect of decreased sexual sensation. Also, it actually greatly increases my libido! The only problem is that it made me constipated and every few yrs I need my dose increased and then the constipation comes back. So if you have this side effect, eat more fiber and drink lots of water and if that is not enough ask your doctor if you can take a stool softener the first month or so you are on Wellbutrin. Your body should adjust after you have been on this for 3-6 weeks and then you should be able to taper off the stool softeners and be fine. PLEASE insist that your doctor tell you how to counter any side effects and try this for 6 wks before you decide whether it is for you. I know 4 people who have been greatly helped by Wellbutrin when no other antidepressants worked or when the other antidepressants had bad side effects.

Originally I was perscribed a twice daily routine but once daily was actually more effective for me. As far as side effects at first it actually decreased my appetite tremendously but that wore off over time. The biggest thing to remember with this drug, or any antidepressant, it takes at least 4 weeks for the effects to really be seen. Also if the depression is being caused by a specific situation the drug is not going to fix or cure that situation. I have clinical depression and this drug has helped balance my body so that I can have a healthy or ""normal"" range of emotions. I still get mad, sad, and depressed at times because of different situations in my life but because of the med I can cope with them. Overall, the drug is extremely effective but please keep in mind no antidepressant is a ""happy"" pill that will all of the sudden make you want to go skippy through the fields. If you have a natural chemical imbalance it is extremely effective at helping create a healthy balance with minimal side effects."

Wellbutin is good for weight loss or  quitting a habit like smoking but' that's it. It's an old school pill and Effexor or Lexapro should be given a test. It has helped me to change to new life when the more modern Doctors came in and put me on the new up to date drugs And, I've been though all depressions and mood swings has to offer in my disfunctional life of stresses.

I also take seroquel (25 mg) which takes some of the edge off the wellbutrin but not enough. I would have fits of rage in which I punched the wall until the skin split on my knuckles. I became a overtalkative nuisance to other people. I began to think they were plotting against me. I suffered from constipation, muscle twitches, seizure symptoms, respiratory problems, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety (there were many occasions where I was afraid to leave the house), and teeth grinding. It got to the point where I had to skip a dose every other day for me to calm down somewhat. My Psychiatrist recently instructed me to ween off the drug and start taking Lexapro. Though its too early to tell how the Lexapro's been working, I've been feeling more like Dr. Jekyll and less like Mr. Hyde lately.

I was on Activas bupropion 150 XL for about six weeks. It stabilized me, but I was still depressed - but functioning. Side effects - waking up early, feeling like a zombie, loss of appetite - went away within that time period. 

I've now been on Par Pharmaceutical's bupropion 300 XL for about a month. Side effects are irritability and jitters, but I'm hoping those go away. I tried Activas 300 XL - oval pills - and it seemed to dump a large portion of the medication about two hours after taking it, giving me a zombie effect. It also gave me a headache. Those things may have gone away with time, but I switched back to Par.

726$Depression$2/25/2019 7:05:12 AM$Reviewer: Warox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"Firstly note this medicine not for everyone. Everyone's brain chemestry is different. It is one of the most popular and commonly used antidepressant due to it's general efficiency and fewer shitty side effects than other drugs. Personally, two weeks after starting 150mg bupropion, I'm already starting to feel somewhat better overall.

The way I've understood this drug works is by preventing the recapture of dopamine and noradrenaline. This leads to a slow but steady build up of those two chemicals in the brain. That' why the full efficiency of this drug is obtained a few weeks later after starting taking it. Dopamine is the feel good reward chemical which makes you feel slightly happier in general and makes you want to do things more since you're reward signal in the brain is ""boosted"". Not absolutely sur about the noradrenaline part but I think it's from this chemical adrenaline comes from. This could explain why this drug makes you more awake and energized than normally. Not sure but dopamine too i think helps keep awake. Anyways, even the specialists aren't exactly sure HOW antidepressants exactly works. 

 So far for me the first few days I felt a little ""something"" positively different about how I felt in general. I've been sadly having trouble to feel emotions and happyness for a very long time. Feel like a machine that mainly works eats and sleep. Now I'm starting to have more energy, want to do more things and actually enjoy myself sometimes. Better mood. I actually smile because I feel like it sometimes instead of smiling because I'M supposed to. Don't oversleep anymore. More sociable. Better attention and focus. Think better. Got some libido back. Losing fat and gaining muscle since im more active. Seems I'm actually starting to enjoy life a little. So far the pros are better than cons. Insomnia (i need seroquel to sleep well), rise in anxiety are the two downsides. A bit worst in the begining but it lessens. Got used to it. Definately worth it for me."

I had never taken anti depressants and my doctor recommended this one. It really made a huge difference in my mood and outlook, however it had one unbearable side effect for me. It made me soooooo itchy. I was losing my mind. I tried everything possible to control the itching, different soap, shower water filter, cortisone creams, numbing cream, ice..  nothing helped. I really wanted to stay on it and did my best to see if the side effect went away but it was excruciating.  As soon as I stopped it within a week it was better. But here I am almost 3 weeks after my last pill and I still get an itch attack all of a sudden Iâ??m the evening or the morning. I decided to write this down because two doctors told me this was an uncommon side effect for this medication and that maybe it was something else, but it definitely was the meds.

I have had severe depression for about 10 years. Had been on prozac and effexor before wellbutrin. They both worked, but not even close to how the wellbutrin is helping me! I'm taking 300mg XL per day.

I felt so much happier even on day 1...  I couldn't believe how happy I was & still am feeling! I didn't know it was possible for a person to even feel this happy! (Not to mention the increased sex drive)!  ??

I also have severe fibromyalgia & social anxiety. Wellbutrin has helped all of it! I knew my effexor was not working for me any longer, since I had been on it for 3 years already.

I found myself gradually staying home from functions I would normally attend, was EXTREMELY fatigued & just wanted to stay in bed all day. My family told me I was very irritable. I didn't see it. I first had my hormone levels checked to see if that was the problem, The hormones were all normal.I called my psychiatrist the next day and started on the wellbutrin.

My family and I noticed a difference immediately, I was laughing again! It has given me an enormous energy boost! I have gotten things done that I've been meaning to do for the last couple of years, but could never do because of the lack of energy & motivation. I even started a part time job! It has suppressed my appetite, which I'm excited about, since I need to lose some weight.

I have never been happier than I am now! Please realize though that all medications don't work for EVERY person... our brain chemistries are all different, but I would most definitely give it a try! I wish you all the best & hope it works as well for you as it has for me.

There were minor side effects the first couple of weeks, (headaches & insomnia) but they went away and I couldn't be more happy or thankful for how much Wellbutrin has helped me!"

The situation still stunk, but at least I was not a weeping mess.  I needed it for six months. The next event happened at age 47.  Wellbutrin helped again.  More bad news at 49 with depression and anxiety this time.  Wellbutrin is keeping me calm and less sad.  No side effects.
763$Depression$8/6/2016 1:32:17 PM$Reviewer: Lucky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was hospitalized for severe depression and anxiety almost two years ago. The doctor immediately started me on a low dose of Wellbutrin (the generic type), and upped it to 300mg before I was released. I went through four other medications for anxiety, since Wellbutrin often does not treat both depression and anxiety. Finally, I ended up with Zoloft, which also enhances the effect of Wellbutrin. Over months of treatment, the Wellbutrin was amazing! It lifted my mood, raised my energy, increased my focus, evened out my appetite, reduced my smoking, and increased my metabolism. With diet and exorcise on Wellbutrin, I was able to lose 50 lbs. Usually my metabolism is so low that I can eat olny salad with steady activity and lose nothing. So getting back down to a normal weight (122 lbs at 5'5"") was amazing. 
After 15 months of treatment, I wanted to wean off of the medications to see how I would do. I had been at the maximum does of 450mg of Wellbutrin and 200mg of Zoloft daily. After 5 months of no medication, I was spiraling down back to where I had started. It was hard to climb back out of that hole, but at least this time I knew the footing. I made an appointment with my doctor, and in the mean time, wanted to start back on the lowest dose of the pills I still had. Not expired, my prescription, all legal. The PROBLEM came when I mistook the dosage for each Wellbutrin pill, thinking they were 50mg each. Well, no, they were 150mg each, and I took three. Really, really bad idea. I felt the effects immediately, felt great, did work, a little shaky, knew I shouldn't drive so I didn't. That night, I got two hours of sleep. Took the same amount the next day, then realized my mistake. I haven't slept in three nights. I'm staying hydrated and being careful, not taking any more, but the point is: When taken correctly, it can amazing! DO NOT take more than directed!"
765$Depression$7/26/2016 11:41:58 AM$Reviewer: zarer77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been slightly depressed for about 10 years, but never thought I needed medication.  After a traumatic event 6 months ago I was sick of crying, no motivation, anxiety, etc. I finally went to my family doctor she prescribed me Zoloft, and hydroxozine for anxiety. I noticed my depression and crying for no reason had subsided, but I became depressed in a different way because it made me so tired I could physically not do anything besides work. She switched me to Celexa and Cymbalta where I had the same problem and could hardly make it through a work day I was sleeping in my car at lunch.  About to give up I went to a Psychiatrist who recommended the generic wellbutrin. I started at 150mgXL for one week noticed absolutely no side effects.  The 8th day I started 300mg and noticed the energy a few hours later. I went grocery shopping, cleaned entire house, etc WILLINGLY.  Normally it would take me a week to have enough motivation to do one of these things. I almost cried I was so happy. I actually sat down and had a conversation with my boyfriend smiling and laughing- he looked at me crazy like he did not know how to respond because I have not been that way in so long. Now, I have only been taking it such a short time, but will definitely try 4-6 weeks for full effect.  I have had mild headaches (I had some before) a little dry mouth, and increased sex drive/orgasm. So far I am just thankful that it has put hope back in my life.

I talked to my Doctor and he proscribed Wellbutrin. Overnight I felt amazing, I felt like my older self. In a year i'd lost 50 pounds, 200lbs down to 150lbs. I've had no side effects except I have dizzy spells occasionally if I stand up to fast. I'm so glad I take Wellbutrin, it changed my life. On a side note I take a bunch of anti allergen medications as well and if I forget to take my medications at night, the next day I feel absolutely awful.

It took all of my energy for the day to answer one email, and I would cry for no reason often. But after three weeks of Wellbutrin 150XL, I was whistling tunes I hadn't in years, and I was happy and energetic for the first time since I was a kid. At the same time, though, it's like my conscience switched off. I immediately started cheating on my wife of 9 years. Repeated hookups again and again with other men. I would prowl around town, horny out of my mind. It was like I was high. I would never have acted on these impulses before, not in a million years. Concerned that I was bipolar, I told my doctor and he screened me, asking if I was buying stuff. No? Then it must be because I was happier and more confident now. I should have insisted something was wrong, but the drug made me not care, plus my happiness made marriage great and she had no idea. I just wanted to keep going. That was 10 months ago. IF YOU GET IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOUR GET OFF OF IT BEFORE IT WRECKS YOUR LIFE. I hate what I've become. I don't know what's going to happen when I get off this cursed drug. I'm afraid all the time. And I'm still doing it.

Started Wellbutrin in early November and altho my mood seemed to lighten, I had major headaches, dizziness and then began periods of nausea. I only took 75 mg. and started with 1/2 dose for 2-3 weeks. Then full pill. I finally realized that the headaches and weight loss were associated with Wellbutrin.  I am trying to maintain my weight as I suffer from major COPD; I lost 3 lbs in the first month. Have less appetite.  Am tapering off with 1/2 dose but will stop this week. Total time I have taken is about 7 weeks.

I had some pretty bad mania, but after about a month it went away. Since then, life has been a lot easier; It feels like I am finally living again. I had tried prozac and zoloft before and didn't have any luck with them. Wellbutrin has helped me tremendously.

I was severely depressed, hardly left the house because of low energy, lack of focus, and stress.  I had been through a job loss and marital problems that led to severe depression.  When I started the drug it gave me more energy and I felt more ""alive"".  I had a slight headache and a some insomnia at first but that got better after a few days.  I was somewhat short tempered at times but that is most likely the release of all the pent up frustration I had been harboring while depressed.  It seemed to increase my sex drive and actually the side effects felt like Viagra in that I had a flushed face and slightly fast heartbeat along with the mild headache.  I am hoping that my better moods continue and that I can get back to enjoying my life and being more optimistic about the future."

After 3 years I started having extreme woozy/lightheaded spells that were ruining my life. Everyone kept blaming it on my anxiety. After three years of hating life I went off of wellbutrin. It took over 30 days before I even started to see relief, but by the 90 day mark I was free from those spells. I have my life back. It would not have gone away. Wellbutrin helps with the kind of depression where you have NO motivation and crave sugar. It will make you dehydrated, constipated, edgy, and a light sleeper that only needs about 6 hours per night. It isn't good for anxiety and will not help it. During the adjustment period you could lose about 10 lbs and have the most vivid nightmares ever. This drug will stop working for you. At first you can be so numb but after awhile you start to feel very depressed again. It's not until you go off of it do you realize that it was helping. It really only seems to be popular because of the lack of weight gain and no decrease in your sex drive. Those are really the only positive things but you just have to figure out if the other side effects are worth it.
783$Depression$9/8/2015 9:07:24 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$FINALLY after a ten year ongoing battle with depression, severe depression and anxiety with panic attacks, I have finally found the right drug combination.  In the past I had a history of starting an antidepressant when things got really bad for me, noticed myself improving then gradually stopped taking it...then gradually fell back into the dark hole that felt impossible to get out of.  I have been taking different doses of Prozac for about the last 6 years ( which I also love when I stay on it ! ) and Celexa before that.. ( made me wayy too sleepy, counterproductive because when i'm depressed ALL i do is sleep ). This last time around, I had finally had enough, I wanted to pull myself together and stay on the medicine once and for all ( hey your Brain is an organ, and if you need medication stay on it! feeling great means it is working :) ) I went back on my Prozac ( 40 mg in Feb. when my depression was at it's worst, and anxiety= vicious cycle) and slowly noticed it taking effect, but not as effective as it was. My Dr. added the Wellbutrin ( 100 mg at first, now 200 ) and within 1-2 weeks I felt better than I have ever, ever. My motivation is back, determination, focus, energy, self worth and purpose all have returned, and gone are the days i feel lost, exhausted, and like a total piece of shit.  Talk to your Dr.! With these meds I've had a whole life style change, I was able to lose 30 pounds and counting, my binge emotional eating has subsided, i work out, went back to school and work like 50 hours a week! I eat great, natural, and organic foods that help fuel my body and mind, and do yoga to center myself.  ALl i needed was that little push, and at almost 30 I'm finally a better version of myself. Hang in there!!! I promise there is hope!

I enjoy life again and now that I'm active my weight is within normal range, and the extra benefits are that I'm more focused and organized.

Because of my nerves and panic attacks. I had panic attacks so bad I would hyperventilate. It was horrible. I'm really pleased with welbutrin and having a dry mouth I just chew a lot of gum.

Unfortunately I have made some poor decisions over the years, and being depressed so much seems obvious to me now, was a huge part of those poor decisions(as well as evidence in journals, and doctor notes to prove depression was ""at fault"").  I guess better late than never.  Its a relief to feel better, not cry every day, to feel good, or at least normal about yourself.

The side effects are with me, but I don't care! Just try to get on it slower if possible.  Don't cut the pills in half, I made that mistake, it can cause an overdose or seizures. I was lucky and wised up on that.

The reviews on this page have helped me a lot, and I want to thank everyone for helping, and the website for making this available.

I am 52 yrs old now, maybe now I can make better decisions, act better, listen better, whine less, focus more, eat less, care more, and be more appealing to myself and others.  Its amazing how so many things can be tied to and capable of working for you, when you get the help.

I hope you get the help sooner than I did, I waited way too many years to get this help, don't wait, at least give it a try."

Around the third or fourth week of Wellbutrin my excessive sleepiness had dissapated and a I experienced much better focus and attention. I no longer needed Adderral to remain focused and alert.

Because of this accident, I suffered severe financial problems and major depression issues. I started seeing a Psychiatrist who prescribed Wellbutrin 150 Mg per day. (I was on Zoloft for 8 years prior to car accident) The first few days I was very jittery and had some bad anxiety. I felt like I was on speed. I then had massive insomnia for first 4-6 days. I also noticed headaches coming and going for first few weeks, but that has gotten a lot better.  THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS, so if there's any advice or comments I can give, it would be to stick out the side effects for first few weeks. It will be worth the wait. This drug has changed my life in such a positive way. I began to get my energy back, sex life got 10 X better and I felt the way I did in my 20's. It's only helped my relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years and my 2 children.

I tried Celexa & EFfexor & quit them immediately due to side effects. I had to switch taking Wellbutrin in the morning bc at night it kept me awake & woke me often. I'm also a smoker & it has cut that back significantly. I had no appetite issues & no change in sex drive. I believe it helps get me up each day & keeps my emotions in better check. I am going through something that causes anger & sadness often. Lots of rants & crying spells but they have subsided & when they do happen it's less intense. It did cause me to be more anxious & I deal with high anxiety already so I am taking Busprione (15 mg 3x/day) on days my anxiety is higher but don't take it every day. 
My ONLY gripe is that on the 300 mg I feel as if my throat is closed all day. It's hard to swallow & feel l have to take deep breaths often. When my anxixety is high, it's much worse, sometimes nearly intolerable. BUT bc I feel it has helped me mood wise, I keep taking it. I'm tired of being a drug guinea pig & hope that this is temporary as I work through my situation. Hoping in time I can reduce back to 150 mg bc I didn't have the throat issue when I took that amount but for now I feel I need the 300 mg. "

Never as long as I can recall into early childhood able to express any positive emotions. As my mother would say instead of a normal young child craving accolades for a job well,hug and kisses I would push her away furious at the thought. Also refusal to conform for treats at friends or relatives houses. I would rather go without cake and ice cream at a bday party than to say please and thank you. Not to be stubborn but would not conform. Most importantly and the root of my issue is still until as od these last few days have I ever, ever EVER uttered the words I Love You. A very painful inner conflict having been married for going on 21 years with 4 children with all other 5 members saying it freely to everyone including to me but have never have had it said by myself. Since my starting this drug I not only have came out from my closed off hidden from letting others know my heart but Im worse than a love sick child with my wife having her almost in tears to finally hear it and now multiple times a day to her unabated......this being said baby steps Im working on it with my children.

I've had no side effects whatsoever. I came out of my deep funk. After 4 months I went up to 300mg XL. I've lost weight, have fantastic sex, and feel better about myself.

I love love love this drug. I take 300mg once a day (I have friends who took lower doses, and it didn't work for them) and the first time I took it, I immediately felt better. I actually got a buzz from it the first time-like way too much coffee-but that disappeared the next day. I have no trouble sleeping while taking it, but it does give me constipation, to a degree-not too bad though. It also increases sexual desire, to a degree that might make it a woman's Viagra. Everyone's body chemistry is different, but I went from being a depressed, irritable witch, to being happy and mellow. I feel peppy, not terribly hungry, and happy. That's a big improvement, but I was never exceedingly depressed, except episodically, so I don't know if it's strong enough for someone with severe depression. It works for me though, and I really like taking it.

Wellbutrin isn't supposed to be effective immediately, but when I started it, I noticed a huge increase in energy and my ability to pay attention, my thoughts felt less cloudy and I felt more optimistic everyday. Those feelings faded a little after about 4 or 5 days (likely a placebo effect).
I have found that drinking alcohol while on this medication makes me turn into a totally awful person to be around. I would get mad at the slightest thing and be completely unable to get over it, no matter how hard my partner tried to help. I would basically shut down for the night if I drank, and would feel depressed for 2-3 days afterward as well.
I have been a self-harmer for about 6 or 7 years. While on this medication, I have only cut twice, but have become much more optimistic that I can stop my addiction to self-harm. I feel like life is more worth living in general and I tend to have a more positive outlook, even when there is some issue at hand. I don't feel like everything that goes wrong is my fault and I feel like I've become more productive and feel much more rewarded when I complete things. 
One other positive of this medication is that it has really decreased my appetite. I'm only slightly overweight at 5'4"" and about 145-150 lbs, but I used to eat all the time and now I don't usually feel like I'm hungry, even when I go half the day without eating. I eat more for taste and for health now than out of boredom. 
Overall I've had a pretty positive experience, and I will likely be switching to the extended release, 300 mg once a day the next time I see my doctor. "

Wellbutrin has worked well for me. However, has anyone had a very slight sore throat or a cold-like nasal feeling or a chesty cough as a suspected side effect of Wellbutrin? Am on 150 mg a day together with 100 mg of Sertraline. I have been on Wellbutrin for around five months and my symptoms have been with me for a similar period. One website indicated that 11% of side effects from Wellbutrin are sore throats. I have had other side effects e.g. constipation although this only lasted for say, 2-3 weeks. 

It would be helpful to know.

Thanks very much.

838$Depression$9/15/2013 6:46:09 PM$Reviewer: rkdb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I took Zoloft for many years and felt it was no longer working.  I have been suffering from depression for several years now while working through marital problems.  I also have Graves' Disease and had my thyroid removed, that resulted in a paralyzed vocal cord which I have just had surgery to repair. I also have been through menopause. My doctor decided to change me from Zoloft to Wellbutrin 2 weeks ago.  The first few days I felt much better - more energy but  able to sleep better than I had in years. After the first week I was to increase to twice daily. Since then I have noticed dizziness that last all the time, unable to think clearly, words not coming out right,  hot flashes, and still having depression and crying spells at night time.  Not sure what to do.  I suppose I will give it a couple more weeks and then follow up with my physician.

The problem I was having was feeling like Sylvester the cat hanging on the ceiling inside all the time. My mind would not let me relax. I was exhausted all the time. I am now after 1 month back to my old joyful self and able to sleep well and just so much more relaxed. My family can see how the anxiousness was getting to me. Now they say I am so much happier and calmer. What a surprise is I have stopped smoking! What a wonderful side effect. Even when I tried to smoke, it seems like it was a waste and not good tasting at all. This is fantastic! I have tried to quit for years. I am very happy with these results and thank God for it.

I have tried many options of depression/anxiety meds and Wellbutrin has been great for me. I have not experienced any weight gain or withdrawal symptoms on this medication.

I slowly increased my dose over 6 years until I was at the heights dose possible. I had no problems with the medication until last year. I had a seizure, but was alone and didn't know if I had dreamt it or passed out or what. 6 months later I had another, and luckily my boyfriend was with me. He said it was a full blown grand mal seizure and I was quickly brought to the ER. The MDs weren't concerned and told me to stop taking Wellbutrin, which I did. Currently, I haven't had any seizures to date. I just wanted to put a warning out there to users (especially with high dosages) not to disregard the warning about the seizures!! "

849$Depression$7/29/2013 11:56:05 AM$Reviewer: Hilde, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I took 300mg (150mg at 6am&3pm)for seven days. At first, I had typical side effects and managed well - dry mouth, metallic taste in my mouth, trouble sleeping. I did experience the benefits of the medication almost immediately after starting to include increased energy. However, on the seventh day after the second dose, I had an allergic reaction about three hours later - due to, according to the doctor, the compounding effect of the medication. I began feeling itchy and had problems with my throat. I could breath and swallow, but my throat felt constricted and like I had a lump in the back. It was very scary and caused me to panic. I called emergency and saw my doctor, who discontinued the medication immediately. My throat is fine, but I still feel a little itchy. That will pass as the medication gets out of my system.

I share this because while allergies are rare, they can happen and if they do, call your doctor immediately. I know that everyone reacts to medications differently and am hopeful that my experience is unique and that others have a positive experience.

Though I am experiencing some mild side effects (memory issues, weird taste in my mouth, some muscle pain in my neck and restlessness at night) overall I do feel it is helping. Due to menopause issues, I was dealing with severe depression and anxiety. The anxiety is completely gone, even in this short amount of time!  I still experience the depression, however it is less than it was. Also, the intense cravings for sweets is gone, though I have not lost weight as others have on Wellbutrin.  I'm assuming it (the lessening of the depression) will continue to improve as the weeks go by. I know it takes a while for the clinical dosage to really start working. Considering the good experience I'm already having, I will continue with Wellbutrin. My doctor is working closely with me to make sure all goes well. I don't always handle medications well so we will see how this goes. I have not experienced the increased sexual desire that others talk about and quite honestly, I am hoping and praying that I  never do!

I had to go back to 150 mg. because of severe dry mouth at the higher dose that didn't go away even though I gave it plenty of time (6 months). It caused painful gums(gum disease). I need the higher dose, but won't risk getting gum disease. That's too bad because it's good for energy and it doesn't effect your sex life like other antidepressants. I still take it because the psych says I need an ""add-on"" drug to make my other psych meds more effective (to ""augment"" my treatment). She actually calls my drugs of lamictal, cymbalta and wellbutrin a ""cocktail."" And I don't drink! I trust and respect my psych, but this really made me laugh.

I had nearly every side effect possible. I was always nauseous, was very shaky, had ringing in the ears, and was disgusted by food. I had to force myself to eat, would eat a few bites and be full, and was hungry again in an hour, just to repeat the cycle. I was so used to not eating that much that one day I had completely forgotten to eat. By 9pm I realized it, forced some soup down, and puked it up within 2 hours. I started with 150mg and eventually up-ed it to 300mg. I wanted so much for it to work. After 5 months of no results I decided to go off of it. I had lost the weight I wanted, but was continuing to lose weight at a dangerous rate. I don't blame the drug; everyone's body is different and will have different reactions.

I was prescribed Wellbutrin XL 150mg and then was supposed to go up to 300mg in a week. I took my first dose of the 150mg yesterday around 6pm and was feeling fine. This morning when I woke up and got out of bed I was dizzy and fell. I woke up at 715am. It is not 1040am and everything is still spinning. I have now fallen about 8 times. I am also having difficulty thinking. I have to think really hard to get my mouth to say what I want. I called my DR. and he told me this is definitely not normal and that I need to stop this medication immediately. He changed me over to Celexa so we will see how that goes.

932$Depression$9/6/2011 2:09:58 PM$Reviewer: Brainfog, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I have been taking 200mg of buproprion for 3 weeks. I recently increased the dose to 300mg a day because I felt no reaction whatsoever to the medication. Although the very first week of taking it, I had suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. But, that has gone away. Now I am having confusion/brain fog. I continue spelling that by writing taht. I can't spell very well at all anymore, and I had a grade of A+ in all my English classes. I keep seeing things running by me, that are not there. I forgot how to walk down my steps. I also take 300mg of Trazodone to sleep at night. I am suffering from depression, ADHD, and OCD. I hope it will kick in soon, as allot of people here have said it does. But for now, I'm going a bit crazy. But, I always forget I feel that way so it's not too bad. I also suffer from Grave's Disease for the past 11 years. That is what made me go to the doctor. I have no memory at all. I think it's Grave's, my doctor thinks depression. Whatever it is, I'm hoping for at least a little improvement.

946$Depression$6/22/2011 4:50:43 AM$Reviewer: B-Ok, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$4$"Started on 150mg for a week, then 300mg for most of the 19 months since then. Paxil was my 1st poison, but the mental fog was too much for me. Tried Lexapro and Celexa for relapses, but.. didn't work. They just kept me 'comfortably numb' enough to get on with my life. Wellbutrin, on the other hand, contributed to a positive change in my outlook. I'm about to finish a graduate program for a professional degree I used to think was way beyond my capabilities. In addition to the degree, I'm in a fairly stable & supportive relationship (not the abusive, drunken ones of my youth), and have picked up 5K's as a recent hobby. Lost about 30 lbs within the 1st year. 
My major downfall is remembering to take my meds everyday at the same time. When I do forget, it takes about 48 hours for the creepy crawling feelings to start clouding my mind, and those are hard for me to shake off. About 4 months ago, I was struggling with my need to take antidepressants, and convinced myself that I could do just fine without any help from therapy + meds. Needless to say, I had a major meltdown within days that took 2 1/2 months of work to finally get ahead. 
Now, 5 weeks back on generic bupropion, I'm realizing the benefits I was afforded with this treatment - alert, focused, driven, confident - I felt more like the person I want to be, plus I have a healthy sex drive. Also, I never, ever want to go through withdrawal again, so I'm declining a recent Rx for Pristiq and all SSRI/SNRIs for as long as possible. I take 2 x 150mg pills everyday before 12pm, to take advantage of the elevated mood + energy boost and ability to really sleep afterwards. I still have my low moments, but I do recover with learned techniques & support."

I was taking (at first) 1-150mg AM,  I has relayed to my doctor that I really really needed to quit smoking, so he says ""ok!"", ""lets up your dose to 1-150mg AM and then 1-150 at noon. (For a few days, he says.) 4 or 5 days later, I went to 300mg AM and 150 at noon. I carried on (with life) as if nothing was happening. Then about 2 maybe 2 1/2 months into the 450mg daily, I woke up one day and started doing my 'honey do's (like always), but this time, i noticed it was almost noon and I hadn't lit a cigarette all day! Well dam, (i'm thinking) I haven't even wanted one all day. I didn't quit all at once. I went from a pack a day to 1/2 pack. THAT DAY. stayed with 1/2 pack  for about a week. Maybe.  From there, i went from 1/2pack 10 a day to 8 and then 7. From 7 to 5, then down to 4 a day. I kinda go stuck of 3 for a few more days than i thought I would but, i climbed the hill anyways and i was now at two a day. For a few days. And then 1. a day. For a few days. Then finally, I had one last cigarette in my car and i smoked it maybe 1/2 down,...and pitched it out the window.  From day one until I lit my last one was about 4 weeks.  But it wasn't the nicotine i was having to break myself from. The Wellbutrin had completely removed all urges and cravings for nicotine. The hardest part with stopping to smoke with Wellbutrin,was the 'breaking' of my old habits. I was well on my way of ridding myself of smoking, My only obstacle was ""what to do with my hands???"" For so long, if i  got on the phone, lite it up. ON the computer, lite it up. Driving down the road in my car,...lite it up. sitting on the front deck, watch the birds fly by,...lite it up! But after I got past all that 'easy' stuff, i was and AM on my way to a much healthier body. For my Grandchildren sake. It's been 5 months this past March 5th. I'm really, really proud of myself. "

If you are depressed with overeating, irritability, and excess sleepiness, try this. If you have a tendency to addictive behaviors, try this.
If you are anxious, can't sleep, have lost weight, or have high blood pressure - do not take this med. It will make things worse.

I thought Wellbutrin was a decent compromise - I still have bad days and crying spells, but I wasn't aware of any side effects.  HOWEVER... Wellbutrin's side effects crept up on me.  I have very, very thin hair now.  And in just the past two months I have a new side effect -- the inner tops of my ears have turned a dusky green/blue shade.  Anyone else with this side effect?  My doctor doesn't know what to make of it.  I attribute it to the Wellbutrin because my daughter also takes it, at the 450 mg level, and her ears started turning before mine did.  This is the only med we have in common.

Also, I take my Wellbutrin in one dosage first thing in the morning; Iknow this is not recommended, but it works for me. I have done this for 15.5 years without problems.

If I take it after 12noon it keeps me up at night.

I also breakout in a bad case of hives (hands, groin, feet) when I take KEFLEX while on Wellbutrin. This never happened with Keflex prior to getting on Wellbutrin...go figure.... obviously don't take Keflex anymore. I never could find any info on this interaction.

Are there any studies on the ramifications of really long-term usage?"

1017$Depression$8/27/2010 9:49:10 PM$Reviewer: anxiousgirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$4$4$3$I have chronic anxiety and panic disorder, but do not normally feel depressed. For some reason docs always prescribe anti-depressents, which usually make me VERY depressed. I hate having to choose between panic attacks and morbid depression. Finally found that tiny amounts of lorazepam (.5mg) as needed help stop most panic attacks, but anxiety was still constant. Doc thought wellbutrin might help, since SSRI's etc. just kill me with depression. She thought since I seem compulsively anxious, and wellbutrin is sometimes prescribed for OCD, it was worth a try. First two weeks I felt much better, but eventually the dose at 150mg./day made me desperately depressed. But a month after I stopped, I was back to feeling out of my skin. So now the past 3 weeks I take 1/2 of a 75 mg. pill of buproprion twice per day, morning and mid-afternoon. I feel so much better! And I've already lost 3 pounds, don't feel either anxious or depressed, just basically calm. Can't tell you what a relief that is. I am thirsty and have some constipation, but those side-effects are worth it. I am very sensitive to medications, and this small dosing is working for me. For me, reducing dosage was the key.

Adding this medication has given me the first sustained relief I have had from depression.  I have been diagnosed with long-term low level depression.  I have had some sleep disturbance and some joint aches.  They have varied in intensity and if the joint aches had not improved my doctor would probably have removed me from the medication.  But I would gladly lose a little sleep in order to finally know what it feels like to not be depressed.  It is wonderful and even great to be tired because of a little loss of sleep rather than just plain tired of life and dragging through my days.  
1029$Depression$7/24/2010 3:29:41 AM$Reviewer: RBJeurope, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$Before taking this medicine my life was a mess. Although I was seeing a psychiatrist I was drinking, smoking, gambling, mildly depressed and had constant mood swings. Within a month of taking this medicine all my addictions were gone. I just don't have the strong urges anymore and can rationalize and control my decisions. I don't look at food the same either sometimes I just don't eat at all (no hunger pains). The best thing about the medicine is that I have lost 20 pounds with exercise. The worse thing is that I have developed an addiction to sweets I didn't have before. All in all I am a better person when taking the drug even though a couple of times I have experienced a day of two of sadness but nowhere near like before. It has been seven months and I am much happier about my life. Wellbutrin is not for everyone and the side effects were very prominent for the first six weeks but went away.  Thank God for this medicine.

I took one dose over the weekend (half of a 75mg tab) and have a migraine again. I'm really sensitive to med side effects, so take this with a grain of salt, but I guess it's back to square one.

About a year ago my doc added Wellbutrin to my regular Zoloft. I had been taking Zoloft for several years and I believe she started it to add to my energy, as it was low, and also to possibly help reduce my appetite. I had been trying for several years to lose weight and still had carb cravings and no weight loss. The first month I took it I lost 10 pounds, and since then have lost ten more. I did feel much more energetic (not manic, but normal)and became more active and was able to get more things done in my home and elsewhere.  Not only have I been treated for serotonin deficiency (for many years)last year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, which also causes fatigue. Wellbutrin has helped, but my dosage was just increased to the highest level, so I hope it remains effective as there is no where ""higher"" to go if my body becomes accustomed to this dosage and then the drug becomes less effective than before.

1052$Depression$5/23/2010 3:35:56 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$2$Wellbutrin has certainly elevated my mood, making me a whole lot more functional. There's a couple side effects I don't like though. Under normal day-to-day activities I don't feel any dizziness, I'm a ballet dancer, and I've noticed that chaine turns and pique turns (basically spinning really fast across the floor) are markedly a lot more difficult, and sometimes I have to sit down in class because the dizziness is overwhelming. This of course is extremely frustrating, I'm one of the strongest dancers in my group, but this is holding me back. I also have a ringing in my ears. I take 150mg twice a day, and I don't like monitering the time so closely to be sure I take them on time. But at least for now, I feel much better than I did before, so I'm not ready to give up on it yet.
1053$Depression$5/22/2010 10:28:56 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$3$Wellbutrin has been very effective for me in that it gives me a boost of energy, easier to get out of bed in the morning, and my social anxiety is a whole lot easier to deal with. I started taking it because my best friend died recently and I was having the most difficult time in the world getting the most basic things done, I never wanted to go out in public, it was extremely painful to do homework and go to class, etc. I've always been a bit prone to depression anyway, but this is the worst it's ever been. I used to take Zoloft, but I didn't like it for 2 reasons, firstly, it took away my sex drive, and secondly, it made me permanently in a good mood, I lost my natural range of emotion. Wellbutrin hasn't done that for me at all, I feel much more like myself, it's still possible to have a bad day and I'm ok with that, I think it's healthy. Of course I'm still grieving my friend very much, it happened only 3 months ago, so I still cry almost everyday, but now it's just for a few minutes and it doesn't completely engulf me. As for the sex drive, oh god, it's increased exponentially, sometimes I need to have sex several times a day or I go a little bit crazy, it's my boyfriend's dream come true. If I wasn't in a relationship it would be a very bad thing!! There's a couple unfortunate side effects: I've lost weight, for most people this is a much desired side effect, but I was already in perfect shape and didn't need to lose any weight. Also, I can't get to sleep at night, so my doctor also prescribed Ambien, which works just fine. The most annoying side effect is the constant ringing in my ears, most the time I can forget and not notice it, but when I do it kind of drives me crazy. And the final side effect is occasional constipation, which is always horrible for anyone. Before I go to bed I drink senna leaf tea, and that works very well, it's pretty powerful stuff.

HOWEVER, there are differences within the generic brand (Bupropion). I recently switched drug stores where my prescription is filled and received a different ""type"" of the same drug. Before I was taking 300XL of an oval-shaped white pill. The ones I just received are 300XL but round white pills. And I feel a distinct difference. 

In fact, I feel like I'm going through the initial first stages of taking the drug all over again (dry mouth, restlessness, jitters). I understand that different companies make the generics but I cannot find a site that states which company has better quality products.  

Overall, Wellbutrin is, IMO, one of the better anti-depressants out there. "

The birth control killed my sex drive, made me gain 30 pounds (I was tall and thin before), ruined my sleeping habits,  made me extra moody, and caused a lot of anxiety.  I felt like I couldn't think clearly any more and I couldn't reason as well - things just weren't connecting in my head.  I didn't want to go off the birth control because of awful cramps so my doctor started me on this drug.  The first few days I felt nauseous and my head felt like it was in a vice.  Within a few days I was feeling fine.  I can think clearly, my sleep has got better, I've gained a little of my sex drive back, and I lost some of the weight I had gained because of the birth control.  I am finally feeling more like myself.  I haven't really had any side affects except increased sensitivity to light.  I am very satisfied with it.

I did not realize how depressed I truly was until I felt normal again. I still have my bad days but they are normal bad days, not suicidal bad days. For the first three weeks my side effects included heart palpitations, excess energy,  a bit of anxiety, and occasional insomnia. Now I experience a little bit of dizziness and anger issues.

I have fought depression for 25 years.  It worsened with pregnancy and marriage to a very narcisstic partner.  I have taken many combinations of SSRIs most have been ineffective until I added Welbutrin.  I have found the generic versions to be much less effective and have had to switch to the Welbutrin SR and XL versions over time in order to continue with the brand name drug.  Overall, Welbutrin has kept me out of bed and functioning because it keeps the mental fog at bay and gives me much needed energy.  The Lexapro augments my symptoms be keeping the suicidal thoughts away and reduces my anxiety.  So, overall Welbutrin has helped me to keep functioning despite a very depressing marriage.  My new insurance will not allow me to continue my current dosages and I am afraid that things will slip back.  Does anyone have suggestions as to handle the insurance limitations?

I have to go off of it because I can not take the side effects. Dry mouth, tremors, anxiety attacks and the worst headache of my life that has not gone away in 5 days. I can not even open my right eye for more than a few seconds because the pain is so intense.

I was taking 150mg for the first week and then the second week I went up to 150 mg twice a day. My skin started to crawl, I turned mean as a snake and yelled at everyone. Forget sleeping. I have had none in over a week. All I do is lay in bed and pray that this intense pounding in my head will go away.

I know some people think that you need to give it more time, but before I was taking this I was just a bit down feeling. Now I am both depressed and anxious and in constant pain and I can't even leave my house.

So my experience with this drug has not been a good one at all. Now I am worrying about any repercussions I may have coming off of it. Hopefully, since I was not on it but a few weeks the withdrawal will not be too bad.

If you suffer from any type of anxiety disorder I would strongly suggest that you do NOT take this medication. "

1115$Depression$1/14/2010 9:59:35 PM$Reviewer: xbabyx, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 14. I tried various medications with little success and many negative side-effects (weight-gain, fatigue, loss of interest/listlessness, etc). For several years i tried to handle my symptoms on my own, and I tauhgt myself how to handle my anxiety attacks but the depression and general anxiety weren't improving. Shortly before I turned 18 I began cognitive behavioral therapy once a week, and a drug regimine to control my symptoms. She prescribed a few different medications along the way to try to find one that worked for me, and one of the trials was Wellbutrin. My mother had taken it with good results, so I consented. After about 3 days I was forced to stop taking the pills - my depression and anxiety had gone from distracting but not over-whelming to literally life-threatening in 72 hours. I began self-mutilating (a habit I had managed to break myself of during my pill-less years) and became incredibly paranoid, agitated, angry, depressed, and I isolated myself from everyone and everything. Again, all within 72 hours! I am not saying this medication is horrible and should never be used by anyone, I just want to share my story so everyone knows that yes it can work (like for my mother), but it might not and might actually be dangerous (like it was for me). So always be sure to discuss any concerns you have with your doctor, beginning or continuing a medication is a big decision and it could have serious effects on your health and your life both positive or negative. Be careful, and good luck!

Lowering the dosage helped. BUT... I still didn't have any motivation to actually get up and do anything. So my psychiatrist suggested this. Can I say wow?? The first day, I got the jitters, like when you've had too much coffee, that lasted a couple of hours, then I never had them again. It also has made me slightly nauseous, which increases with dosage increase. I'm currently taking half of a 75mg pill, because taking a whole one made extremely nauseous. Now, after a month on a half, the nausea is almost completely gone. It also does control my appetite. I eat way less and my usual ""grazing"" doesn't happen anymore. yay! I'm very happy on this medication. If you're  having the extreme side effects, talk to your doctor. coudl be the dosage is too high. "

1159$Depression$11/1/2009 5:50:41 PM$Reviewer: Astrid, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Though a generally upbeat person, the back to back deaths of my mother and a close colleague put me in a real angry, depressive state.  I tried psychotherapy for 3 months without much help.  Reluctently, I told my physician about my state of mind during a routine visit and she recommened Wellbutrin.  After about 2 weeks on the med the fog lifted from my head and once again I feel joy.  Though I do experience a slight dry mouth side effect, I am also experiencing a decrease in appetite which is actually a benefit as I have always had to closely watch my calories in order to maintain my slender figure.  I plan on remaining on the drug until springtime (I live in the PacNW and the nonstop winter rain is enought to make anyone depressed!) and will slowly wean myself off.

I think this medicine only works for so long before you start becoming immune to it.

I still had bouts of depression. My psychiatrist tried adjusting the Effexor dosage (up) with little effect. He next suggested that I concurrently start Wellbutrin WITH Effexor. Wow. As somebody else has said recently, I didn't remember what my old self was really like ... and I got ""me"" back. Truly, the world seemed an infinitely brighter place.  I've been on this combination since 2004. In 2008, I tried to wean off of Wellbutrin (being the easier of the two drugs to quit) but after several months I realized that I didn't like ""that"" person. Went back to the Wellbutrin and back to my happy self. I'm a huge fan."

I have been taking the drug for a week and am experiencing dizziness, nausia, and headaches as side effects. I am hoping that these are temporary. Otherwise I do feel that the drug is working its way to treating symptoms of depression. However, if side effects do not lessen within a couple of weeks I would not be able to continue treatment.
1184$Depression$9/26/2009 9:46:35 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$4$"I'm laughing at the other ""reviews"". People: take the medication exactly as prescribed. If the side effects are too strong, tell the dr., but just because you get certain side effects at certain dosages, doesn't mean it doesn't work. This has been great for me! I was taking prozac before for YEARS. I have been taking Wellbutrin now for about 1-1/2 years. Don't review it if it's been 2 days or 2 weeks!! I've never known an anti-depressant that works that soon. Obviously, the major things you should report to your dr and maybe the dose needs to be decreased. I know, been there, done that. This decreased my apetite (I gained with prozac) and improved the sex drive (great for my marriage). I felt mental clarity and I felt like ""me"" which I hadn't felt in years. One of my first reactions was, ""Man! I missed myself."" I have so much more energy (which as you know with depression is horrible). My dr initially recommended that I work my way up to 4 a day (2 am, 2pm), but that was too much and I felt some of the things others have described (suicidal thoughts-never felt that before this). I didn't like the two doses a day. I'm only taking one and it's okay. My drs told me what symptoms I may feel and were great about following up. Yes dry mouth and funny taste, but I didn't jet the ""jitteriness"" that they said I might. Do a ""google"" search for it, there's a website where people review this after more than 2 days of taking it...lol :)"

I went from not eating and losing 45lbs in 2 months to taking Pristiq which made me want to jump out of a window and was causing me to wake with extremely bad anxiety attacks(once I finally fell asleep), hyperventilate and miss work.I tried that for 2 weeks and couldn't stand it any longer. Then I was prescribed Lexapro, which after the 1st night made me feel the same way as the  Pristiq and I immediately stopped that next day. My doctor was so perplexed and gave me 150mg of Wellbutrin. I was nervous at 1st but then I made it thru 2 weeks and was feeling GREAT! My mood changed and I was actually sleeping like I haven't in YEARS!I'm now doing 300mg and can really see a difference. I think I am going to stick with this until otherwise proven different.It's all about what you can tolerate. But I've learned that if a drug like these make u feel worse... as soon as u realize it...STOP IMMEDIATELY and CALL SOMEONE WHO'S AWARE OF YOUR SITUATION!

I was stoked at first to have no side effects, but last night, I noticed what I thought was some dry mouth and when I was trying to sleep, my restless leg syndrome (which is mild) was worse, and I felt sort of like I had a mild electric current running thru my entire body. Today, the dry mouth is definitely there (bummer), and I seem to be developing a slight tremor. Also feel slightly nauseated and am having anxiety issues.  I get headaches a lot, so it's hard to tell if the headache I've got today is from the drug or just me. If this is as bad as it gets, I'll keep taking it, but the seizure thing is making me nervous, what with the feeling of an electric current running through me. I'm gonna tough it out and see if it gets better; I realize there's a period of adjustment, and I really want this drug to work, since it doesn't cause problems with weight & sex drive.  I am perimenopausal, and it might be making the hot flashes worse, though. That SUCKS.

My Dr. would like to up this dosage to 450, however I'm not comfortable with this dosage - have tried this higher does for a few days and could not handle it. With the 300 mg/ first few weeks my fingers twitched but this passed. My sex drive has improved , started going to yoga and pilates classes on a reg. bases. Stopped sneaking back to bed after dropping the kids off at school and smile more. Infact I sleep less and feel okay. Need to eat prior to taking and if I take the medication in the afternoon sleep is difficult that night. Have tried paxol - 3yrs ago for postpardom depression- symptoms - fell asleep while sitting up on the couch, that's more than just tired and lost my sex drive completely. Different people metabolize medication differently. My Dr. now wants to add Lexapro to the mix - not to sure about this which is why I'm doing my research. Also was prescribed clonazepam, however I have only taken three pills in the three months and only a half pill each time. They make me feel high; a little to good.

Once I started to feel like it wasn't working for me so my MD told me to take 200mg twice a day; but found it to cause dizziness and  a feeling like I was going to pass out, had difficulty driving.  So I cut back to 100mg bid, and those sx immediately went away.  Funny thing was, though, my MD didn't think the Wellbutrin had anything to do with it; but I had just increased the dosage about 2 weeks prior and it went away immediately when I cut back.  I made sure my MD knew this.  Then after talking to a friend, I tried 200mg at bedtime.    This works best for me. I even lost 20 lbs. I would recommend it; just make sure you are advocating for you.  If you don't agree with your dr, tell them!!

One thing that I have noticed about it is that I really need to take it at the same time everyday.  I take 450mg, two pills in the morning and one in the evening.  If I'm an hour or so late on one of my doses, I get a little cranky, but it goes away shortly after I take my dose.  I also have noticed that I don't sleep as long.  But I seem to still be well rested most of the time, even when I only get 4 hours of sleep.  It beats the drowsiness I felt with the other meds.

Currently, after re-engaging at the higher dose (150 mg SR 2x a day, previously was on 150mg SR 1x/day) I have had almost no side effects, certainly none that are substantially disturbing. And for probably the first time in 40 years I find my depressive symptoms dramatically reduced, well below what I had previously thought of as 'normal' or 'complete symptom elimination.' I now feel that I was not aware of what normal is. For me, I believe my body needed some time to acclimate to the drug. However I am so happy with current status I wished I had tried the higher dose again sooner.

I had gastric bypass surgery so it is very important the meds I take are not known for causing weight gain.

I have also found that taking Wellbutrin in conjunction with Provigil helped me more than any other combination of medications.  Unfortunately I am unable to continue with Provigil because of the cost associated with it and not having insurance to assist with the cost."

My doc and I are in search of something else.  The side effects have been minimal for me.

I started out on the XL 300mg once a day but it made my stomach upset and gave me horrible headaches. So I went to my doctor after a few months and we brought it down to 200mg. I take it in the morning and it really does feel like it gives me a burst of energy. I was pretty depressed before and I had issues controlling my anger sometimes, and that is pretty much gone away now. I really like Wellbutrin. I will say though that it makes you twitch sometimes, which I don't like, but it's not noticeable most of the time.

After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

The side effects i've had is dry mouth, sore throat, and a weird taste in the morning and late at night.  I have also had insomnia but i suffered from that long before and my doctor has prescribed me a sleeping pill that works hand in hand with wellbutrin.  I have noticed that i have been feeling a little more jittery today since i have increased it but i will moniter and see if my amount is too much.  I believe that this will go away after a while though.  lastly i just wanted to add that i ate my feeling when i was depressed and while i am not horribly overweight i am a little and that was one of my biggest reasons for being depressed.  and slowly i am noticing my appitite and cravings going down and i think i am losing a little weight.  thank god!  but i recommend doing your homework and not settling but finding the right drug for you. before i took lexapro and it killed my sex life and i took cymbalta and it made me very dizzy and nauscious.  so i have finally found something that works FOR ME.

Didn't know people could ever feel this good, or be this focused & clear-minded.  DX over the past decade with PMDD, ADHD, Depression & SADD.  Also have Hashimoto's, and arthritis causing chronic pain & disturbed sleep.  

On Wellbutrin, I didn't implode from stress over the holidays, I'm not dwelling on things or blowing them out of proportion, anxiety is down, and my self-attitude is more positive.  I feel far more connected to people & interested in things, and I'm not procrastinating so much.

The combo of careful monitoring & tweaking my thyroid hormones, a daily progestin-only mini-pill to counter-balance high estrogen levels, a using a SADD lite box a few times a week, plus Wellbutrin, seems to be the answer for me.
  
I started on Wellbutrin @75 mg daily for 4 weeks, moved to 100 mg of XL daily 2 weeks ago.  Only side effect is getting a bit overheated while sleeping.  Normally I wear sweats, a nite cap & blanket set on High, so this is a good thing.  

Tried SSRIs - Zoloft, Prozac & Lexapro, plus Atenolol for anxiety/stress symproms, & Strattera for ADHD, but cardiovascular side effects were extreme, or left me feeling ""flat"" and apathetic, and had a major allergic reaction to Strattera."

The good effect I've had so far is a clarity in dealing with depressive thoughts and the appearance of optimistic thoughts- it has given me moreso the capacity to choose among them. The side effects, though, are infuriating. I feel constantly in a haze, dizzy, and less aware. My vision is a little blurred. I have mild headaches, but not near as bad as ones I got from SSRIs (prozac, lexapro, celexa). I feel somewhat nauseous. Reading takes a little more effort and I'm having a hard time spelling, which is really strange- not being able to pull the words forward, maybe because I have blurry vision and feel hazed over. Do the side effects normally go away with time? I hope so. I want badly for this drug to work.

I really didn't want to think I had something I couldn't take care of myself.  I started taking a low dosage of Wellbutrin (actually the generic) once a day about 2 months ago and it has worked very well for me.  The first couple of weeks I felt a little dazed and loopy and I have mild headaches every now and then but those seem to be the only side effects.  I actually lost a little weight when I started but now have come to a stand still in the weight area.  My overall mood has benefited greatly and I find myself enjoying life more and I take things in stride much better. My Dr. has suggested that I only stay on it for a few more months and then go off it which I think I will try as I hate being on a medication every day.  I do think I'll wait until Spring as I live in Upstate New York and our winters always depress me!  I found this sight because I'm looking for a cold medicine with a decongestant that I can take with Wellbutrin.  I don't like having to worry about drug interactions when I just want to take a simple cold tablet.  I would recommend this medicine to anybody that is looking for some releif from depression.

It was very annoying,thought it would go away,but at 6 weeks was getting worse. Also had horrible constipation,felt bloated due to not having normal bowel movements. Tried to go ""cold turkey"" off Wellbutrin,not a good idea. The twinges/shocks got worse after 2 days,and got very aggitated/mean for no reason, so started back on Prozac 20mg(with which I was on 40mg Prozac before starting Wellbutrin). Twinges have slowed(after 1st day of restarting Prozac)- starting to feel normal again.  Also had the side effect of ""heart pounding in my head"" while on Wellbutrin.  Going to talk to doctor about this."

It was the one and only anti-depressant I was even willing to try based on the possible side-effects. Thankfully, it worked for me because I know many people have to try several different types of meds before they find the right one (or combination) that will work for them. I do recall that it took about six weeks for many of the initial side effects to go away; tingling sensation, bad taste in mouth, mild nausea, insomnia, etc. At the time, I was severely depressed/suicidal and suffered from PTSD as well. The initial bothersome side effects were minor compared to my critical emotional state, so I didn't focus on them too much. I'm glad for that now, because I could've easily decided that the drug wasn't working and found myself getting on the medication roller coaster that many people suffer through. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't taken this drug. The other thing that helped is that I didn't rely on medication alone. At my worst, I was seeing a counselor 2-3 times per week. Eventually, I was able to go on a very light dose (100mg 1xday), just as a preventative measure. That was 6 years ago. No recurrence of depression and I couldn't identify any side effects that are problematic if I tried. Severe, chronic depression runs in my familly and my first onset of this level of clinical depression was when I was just 9 years old, (I'm 45 now). One of my brothers was even younger. The only family members that are not struggling with severe depression are the ones that are on Wellbutrin. One family member changed meds (from Well to many others) because he couldn't deal with the insomnia and he spent the next 4 years spiraling down to the pits of hell. He went back on it 6 months ago and he's doing well. Yeah, I'm a big fan of Wellbutrin and a fortunate one at that. Good luck to those of you just embarking on recovery. My heart really goes out to you.

For the first two days it did help with the depression, but by day 3 I was totally wired: jittery, super anxious, unable to eat or sleep, felt like electricity was flowing to my finger tips, etc. I stopped and took an anti-anxiety med for a couple of days, just to be able to relax and sleep. Then switched to regular Wellbutrin: 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the afternoon. I think it does help with the depression but I still have ups and downs all the time. Overall feeling less gloomy and hopeless. However, it completely killed my appetite. I am never hungry. I try to eat more or less regularly, but have lost weight. The other side effect is almost constant, low grade nausea. My doc suggested increasing to 200 mg/day, but that just made the nausea worse. For now, I will stick with 150 mg/day. I also continue to take an anti-anxiety med (Clonazopan) at bedtime. I don't get more that 4 or 5 hours of sleep, but at least when I do wake up at 5 am, I feel calm and sometimes can even go back to sleep for a bit. I feel a bit tired during the day, but am not sure if it is because of lack of sleep or the Wellbutrin.

I started Wellbutrin about three years ago. I still become depressed, but nothing like I used to be. I no longer self-injure. It does not affect sexual functioning, as other meds do. But if your insurance will only pay for a generic, make sure you ask for BUPROPRION, not BUDAPRION. The latter does not work! During my time on it, I started hurting myself again. I thought I lost all the ground I thought I had gained. Fortunately, I looked on PublicPharmacy.com, and learned that many people have had the same problem with Budiprion.

None of them seemed to work. Either I would feel absolutly horrible like I did with prozac, or I would feel nothing. WellButrin has seemed to work the best so far. I have only been on it for about a month, and I am already seeing results. HOWEVER, this drug is making me lose my hair. Im a female by the way, and in most people's opinions losing your hair is worse when youre a woman. My hair started to thin at the top of my head. My whole life I have had very thick hair. My hair is completely thin now. I have a bald spot at the top of my hair. Im on the younger side for taking this drug, and i feel that by staying on this I will lose more and more. I have talked to other people who lost their hair also. So it's not just a weird side effect for me. I really do not understand why it is not listed as a side effect. I would personally most likely not prescribe this to someone for that reason.

Went off it gradually (very important) to see if I needed it.  Within 6 months all my depressive symptoms had gradually returned until they became very bad.  The last 5 of these 14 years I've used the generic which seems erratic or not quite as good.  I take much less now, 100 mg/day, NEVER within 6 hours of bedtime.   Also, if you have any manic state of mind consult your doctor and read the package  info.  Tapering off of it is important if you want to stop it and a very gradual build-up is important if you are starting it.  This helps avoid headache. 
Also, I feel that it's often hard to concentrate, comparable to a little too much caffeine and would like to know more about others' experience."

Wellbutrin makes me feel like the fog has lifted.  I start to feel so good, in fact, that I'll stop taking it, but I always crash 6-18 months later.  I hate being on any antidepressant, but this one (150mg 2x daily) has worked best for me.  Side effects (sleeplessness, dry mouth, decreased appetite, a general speedy feeling) have always been mild and and have worked themselves out in a couple of weeks.  Always drop a few pounds, too.

The only thing that I noticed is that I don't have the perception of being thirsty but I make sure I drink at least 8 cups of water daily.  I also have a broken sleep at night and feel the need to eat when I wake up during the night which is unusual since welbutrin is supposed to take away from your appetite.  However, it might be the side effects of the other meds that I'm on or I might need a lower dose of wellbutrin.  Other than that, no complaints.

I was put on Lexapro, and have been at a dosage of 20mg for the last 5 months.  I've felt pretty great on Lexapro, and took Clonozepam for about a month and a half to get over my panic disorder.  Over these past six months, I have had very little trouble with panic, nothing more than low level anxiety, which was easily knocked out with a Clonozepam.  Zero panic attacks though (after having them about 20 times a day).  About two weeks ago, I began to feel ""down"" again, as school came to a close, and life was about to change.  I consulted my doctor, and he placed me on Welbutrin.  150mg for a week, and then up to 300mg.  I started taking this 9 days ago, and have had more issues with anxiety and panic in those few days than in the last 6 months.  This medication should NOT be given to patients with panic/anxiety issues.  I'm calling my psychiatrist tomorrow and getting off of this stuff."

1403$Depression$4/23/2008 4:29:49 PM$Reviewer: sissylou71, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$"I started taking Wellbutrin about 2 months ago for depression and it has definately helped me.  I was DESPERATE to keep my marriage intact and to be a better mother. I walked around sad all the time with no desire or motivation for no reason at all. I also seemed angry all the time. 
At first, I was a little nauseus and a tiny bit dizzy, but the thing that I noticed most was that I was restless at night and my mind RACED and I could NOT shut it down! I didn't sleep much the 1st few nights so the pharamcist reduced my dosage to 150mg per day instead of 300mg (SR, not XL) and I could sleep again, felt less dizzy and less nauseus as the days went by until eventually I felt normal except for the dry mouth that I have 24/7.
 Recently I noticed after 2 months that it seemed to wane just a little and I felt some anxiety again. I asked the pharmacist about increasing my dosage. He put me on 200 mg per day about 3 days ago and WHAM! The nuaseusness hit full force today and I threw up and felt so dizzy that the room continued to spin and I could not function. I have been drinking a lot of water to flush it out of my system and I feel better now. He is now going to let me try 200mg per day in 2 doses 12 hours apart instead of just one big 200 mg dose all at one time.(I weigh less than 120 lbs so it was a bit much for me) Be patient, if you are taking it for less than a month, stay with it for a little longer, the side effects went away for me. 
My family members do not know that I am trying this. I noticed that I am much more relaxed and less obsessive about stupid little things and I think more clearly, have more energy, and am a bit more patient with my kids. It helped me to realize how today is important and to enjoy what I have now because  life is too short! I still feel anxious at times, but not like I used to be! Also, I am not so negative all the time and critical about others. 
I hope that it continues to work for me!
I wrote a lot in hopes of helping others.

Taking Wellbutrin together with Imipramine, the Wellbutrin has some kind of a reaction that does not allow the Liver to properly metabolize the Imipramine.  This happend to me.  I presented with all kinds of Neurological symptoms, but actually had VERY HIGH BLOOD LEVELS of imipramine even though my dosage had remained unchanged for over a year.  There is some actual medical research available to back this up, however, until recently this has not been a problem because these two drugs are not often prescribed together.

I had issues with Lexapro because it made me sleep almost 20 hours one night a week. So far I do notice a loss of appetite, and nice as that is, I have to make sure at the end of each day that i have had enough to eat. This may have to do with taking concerta which also lowers appetite. I really don't feel jittery or anything. It defainetly gets my oversleeping under control and is great so far. I got sick during this time so it  is possible that some symptoms i had were related or lexapro withdrawal. These were headache, loss of consciousness (but i have low blood pressure), nausea, and ears popping. I don't know much else yet but so far it is working. It also has made me not need to smoke (which is great because i really shouldn't). It could be depression but i also feel like i am either over or under emotional. Don't know but it is better than oversleeping. I would take pretty much anything over that.

1453$Depression$12/9/2007 8:20:06 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have struggled with depression my whole life and I am not 34. I have been one-and-off meds since 2000. In April 2007 I went back on the meds again. This time it was Zoloft, which made me feel terrific when it kicked in, but I gradually needed more and more until I (at 110 lbs) was at the maximum dosage of 200mg generic Zoloft (sertraline) by September 2007. So my psychiatrist added Wellbutrin, which seemed to help. Honestly, as someone who actually works as a license adolescent therapist and has a lot of experience with my own and treating depression.... the cycle never ends. You spend your whole life switching meds, gradually going off the meds, changing meds, and starting meds over. The best thing you can do is read a lot of books about depression and figure out what contributes to your depression. For me, I grew up with an alcoholic parents and basically walked on egg shells. You never knew if you'd be yanked out of bed by your hair in the middle of the night to wash dishes, you could never have a friend over and no matter what you did it was wrong. Research shows this actually interferes with your brain development and contributes to depression. Today, I have a busy career and I have to monitor how much I take on or I get angry and obsessive along with the depression. I can also say you need to marry someone who understands depression and is NOT depressed themselves. The spouse needs to be supportive and you need to have rules. One of our rules is that my husband will never walk away from me (because it sends me into a depressive rage). My husband also realizes that sometimes I say mean and nasty things to him that I would never say if I weren't having a depressive angry moment. It's hard. We have a toddler and my husband is an at home dad. We love our daughter and want her to have a parents at home, but it can't be me with my depression. My husband being at home help lessen my depression because it's less home-management for me. [email protected]

The problem I have with Wellbutrin is the feeling like throwing up, nauseau, and sometimes throwing up.  This only occurs in the evening.  It feels like morning sickness in the evening without being pregnant.  Does anyone have any suggestions of how to deal with the unpleasant side effects or how to minimze/eliminate them?

Itried to just stop and it was hard. When I slowly reduced the dose I was able to get off it okay. My sister took Paxil and stayed hooked on it. It also killed her sex drive and caused her divorce. Her husband cheated on her. I didn't have any problems like that with Wellbutrin and I lost 18 pounds! God bless the people who invented this stuff.

Before I started Bupropion, I had had five depressive episodes in four years; I have not had a depressive episode since I began taking Bupropion four years ago. I can feel happy again and I can laugh. I am able to feel sadness, but it doesn't overwhelm me. I am not drowning in self-loathing anymore. I am myself again and I have been myself for four years. As far as negative side-effects are concerned, I will have a migraine if I accidentally skipped a dose the day before. It also took a while to kick in. The first two weeks were difficult because my brain would go ""offline"" in the afternoon and I wouldn't be able to do anything until my brain ""restarted"" later in the evening. This pattern lasted for a few weeks. The first month was pretty terrible, though there were glimmers that things were changing; I would feel less awful than usual for ten minutes every few days. The second month was a little better; I was able to feel happy for an entire hour one day and could generally enjoy things more. Week nine was when I had five whole good days where I could feel happy any time I wanted all day long. Week ten was when everything took off and I started feeling like myself again. Four years later, this medication still works for me. I have been able to get back on my feet and rebuild my life after my depression because the chemicals in my brain are working for me and not against me. I feel good. I can feel good whenever I want. I'm not held captive by depression anymore. Bupropion made all of that possible."

The depression feeds into my anxiety.  I am a low starting dose.  I am concerned about my blood pressure, but it hasn't noticably risen.  Part of my issue may have been working remotely with little to no human interaction whilst my better half goes to work.  That said, I am not as anxious these days.  I even started traveling for business again and it is painless!  I feel the need to exercise somewhat regularly again!  I sweated two days in a row and actually jogged on the treadmill! I can't say that I have lost any appreciable weight, but I feel ""lighter"" in mood and actually want to do things.

1520$Depression$2/7/2018 2:00:53 AM$Reviewer: ScreenNamePerson, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I was suicidal (didn't want to wake up, began to consider suicide, every day was arduous, couldn't eat, socializing was difficult, loss of enjoyment of anything, hopeless, etc).  Went on 150 XL and had slight improvement, after 6 weeks went up to 300 XL and more improvement, and began to be able to live a normal life and be myself again.  With the increase to 300 i noticed my ears ring (but i already had tinitis so mostly it's just a worse version of something i'm used to coping with), my mouth is often dry and now and then my lips get super chapped, and the most notable thing is that i have a slight tremor, particularly in my thumbs.  I cannot easily delicately pick up things, which makes picking at food awkward.  It's about 4 months since i first started taking Wellbutrin (i'm on the generic, btw-Medicaid woo!).  The past week the skin around my thumbs has felt kind of thick when i bend them and TODAY i am noticing a stiffness in my left thumb. None of the other side effects alarmed or excessively bothered me enough to go back to being suicidal, but this stiffness is weird, it's like i don't have full range of motion or my thumb just won't go where i want it to.  Texting tonight has been very awkward, and typing is also feeling kind of weird, so this is the first time i've felt uncomfortable about a side effect.  If it worsens I would start to consider changing it up, but that of course is an upsetting thing to have to deal with and invite that kind of chaos and darkness back into my life now that i'm finally getting on track after wasting months laying in bed.  Hope you guys are doing well.

Each increase in dosage was beneficial for about a week, but then I'd hit a plateau. 450 seemed to be the right dose for about 3 weeks, but I've been on this dose for 8 weeks now and feel like the cons are starting to outweigh the pros. I'm not as focused anymore, in fact I've began to have more apathy. My depression hasn't really been helped and I have emotional panic attacks now and then, especially if I drink alcohol-which I was told was the equivalent to completely skipping a dose..makes sense. I've lost 5 lbs, and I'm not binge eating when I feel low, but now I'm obsessed with the weight loss and feel like that's equally problematic. I am less impulsive, but now I seem more obsessive than normal. I've had multiple surgeries in the past 2 years and I was developing a narcotic addiction, within 2 days of taking this medication that craving went completely away, but my ruminating thoughts are increasing again and the impulse to take a pill for no reason but to feel numb is coming back. I take this along with Lamictal, I've been on Lamictal for 3 years, but it wasn't helping with my depression that I cycle with every 6 weeks. I'm ready to get off of this medication, especially since I notice an increase of negative behavior during my menstrual cycle and I'm a week away from another one.

Tried to look up ""Actavis"" pills on ""Pill identifier"" and one of the pills-the 300 mgs., cannot be found so I am going to discontinue with the generic version of this medication and ask for the name brand, as I have heard many mixed/negative reviews for the newer generic versions of this medication. I am told at the pharmacy and by doctors that generics must be bioequivalent to the ""real"" drug and may contain ""other fillers/byproducts"", however, as I have had a generic migraine medicine prescribed that did not work at all-when the ""name brand"" works like a miracle. So I will consult with doc. for ""name brand"" or go to another medication, tired of the merry-go-round of generics.    "

I do really like wellbutrin, moreso than SSRIs or SNRIs because it doesn't have quite as bad interactions with illicit drugs (If you're gonna do it at least be kinda smart about it) but mostly because it didn't have as many side effects for me, all I noticed was increased sweating for the first month which has gone away, and my appetite is poor and I lost some weight after I started it, but thats about it.

I never had one side effect from it and could tell a difference in my mood right away. I also got back my sex drive that the Zoloft had totally taken away.

1595$Depression$1/7/2015 4:14:52 PM$Reviewer: autonomous_anonymous, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I relied on these reviews when I first started meds, so wanted to share my experience. 
I have been on Wellbutrin XL 300mg for about 2.5 years with extremely positive results. This is the first antidepressant I have ever taken, and I have been much better on it. No more falling through emotional thin ice 20+ times a day, no more crying, and hardly any negative thinking. Started on 150xl for about 1.5-2 months then up to 300XL. 
In the first months experienced almost no side effects save for a few strange new headaches a couple days, but they quickly went away. Only side effect is constipation, which can mostly be mitigated with fiber and good eating. 

I take it in the morning and it has not affected my sleep, though I find I do sleep better and am more refreshed when I occasionally take valerian or even a melatonin/benadryl. 

Last year I felt while I was doing well, but still needed a little umpf to push ahead. Tried the 450mg xl and it was fine for a few days/ a week but proved to be too strong; I felt angry, emotional rollercoaster started again, and couldn’t' focus or concentrate. Back down to 300 and all is well. Cost for brand name is outrageous. From my research decided to stay away from generics, and found a reliable pharmacy to order from for a fraction of the local pharmacy cost.
Exercise is still a must for me to feel O.K.   Not more than 2 days without of I fall back into a slump. Gym used to make me go from a -6 to maybe a 1-3.  Now I go from feeling a 3 to a 9/10 after the gym. "

It has gotten better since but still not as good as when I was on celexa. My side effects are severe dry mouth and my ears ring all of the time, drives me crazy but are obviously not the worst side effects you can have.  I was placed on this because the weight gain I had while on celexa made me feel unhappy and unhealthy. I have been on300mg for about 2 months. Not overly pleased but it has gotten better with time and I figured I would give myself about one more month before i talk to the dr about another change.

1609$Depression$9/25/2014 12:01:37 PM$Reviewer: DJKLondon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I am a 47 year old male diagnosed with ADHD combined with bouts of major depression. Over the years I have tried every tricyclic, SSRI, SNRI and atypical antidepressant on the market. While I was taking Ritalin or Dexedrine I never experienced the dpression but I decided that I wanted to go medication-free for my ADHD. I question the wisdom of that decision but anyhow my doctor suggested we try Wellbutrin and I agreed. I started by taking 150mg first thing in the morning and then 300mg every morning since then. It's been about 5 months now and I can't believe the change in how I feel! Wellbutrin lifted me out of the depression right away (ie within 2 days) and it helps with the ADHD symptoms as well. Not to the same extent as the stimulants but it's enough that I can focus now and get tasks completed. I am so thankful for whoever invented bupropion. One think I noticed is that it is closely related to amphetamine and diethylpropion, both used in the past as anti-depressants/anorectics. I believe it is this similarity that gives Wellbutrin the edge over the SSRI's (which are garbage in my opinion)currently in use and I would not hesitate to recommend Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR or XL to anyone who is suffering the debilitating symptoms of depression! Two thumbs up for Wellbutrin!

I started on 150 mg, and then a couple weeks later was upped to 300 mg. I have been on wellbutrin for about 2 months, and have not had a single depressive episode. I was really hoping this would help with my anxiety but it hasn't. Luckily it hasn't made it worse either. Very very happy on/with this drug and it also helps with my ADD! 
1615$Depression$8/22/2014 9:22:43 AM$Reviewer: katred, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$"As an antidepressant, it worked wonders within the first week, as the dose was being titrated up.  I had energy and experienced needed weight loss and was very pleased, as I did not do well on SSRI or SNRIs.  Unfortunately, I was not aware that I had a low seizure threshold and by the second week, I had a 15 minute duration grand mal seizure and resulting head trauma.  Therefore, the medication had to be discontinued.  

For individuals NOT prone to seizures, I think this drug could be very useful, but I do think extreme caution should be taken when prescribing to anyone, even is there is no known history of seizure, and it is imperative that front office staff be educated on signs of impending seizure.  

I called the doctor's office to report very uncomfortable side effects that seemed to come on rather quickly (tremor, severe ringing in the ears started overnight during second week of therapy and increased dose) and was told by the receptionist that they couldn't see me that day and ""might be able to work me in the next day"", and to not stop the medication until I spoke to the doctor.  After I hung up the phone, I immediately had my seizure.  I don't know if the agitation of their lack of care brought it on, or if it would have happened at that moment anyway, but I learned to be more insistent with medical staff members after this experience.    

So, overall, a wonderful alternative to SSRI and SNRI meds, but not enough education is provided to the staff at many medical offices and a 'warning sign checklist' needs to be in the patient file whenever this medication is prescribed."

1620$Depression$8/3/2014 6:36:12 PM$Reviewer: LarryV, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been using Wellbutrin XL 300mg for about 5 years. Prior to it, I was using SSRI type antidepressants. I would recommend anyone with mild depression, which what I have, to try this  first. All the SSRI types caused me to gain weight, feel drowsy during the day, low energy and killed my libido.  Or it did mine. Ladies, if your husband has lost interest in sex while on SSRI's, it is not you. It is the drug. And I would still have bouts with depression. The Wellbutrin XL has none of the above side effects. It's almost the reverse and worked just as good for me as all the newest SSRI meds. Getting off SSRI's can be tough. They have some known withdrawal symptoms. A quick search of those can be found online. I felt like electrical charges were going through my brain and saw flashes of lights. Once that was over and I got on the Wellbutrin, I felt so energized. My libido came back and was higher than before the SSRI's!! I lost 30 pounds too. I tell everyone to try Wellbutrin first. I don't know why doctors don't recommend this medication. My psychiatrist never mentioned Wellbutrin to me. Started me right off with the SSRI's. I did my own research to find them, as I knew I had to get off the others.

My social life perked up considerably, and graduate school is not the constant source of stress that undergrad was- and I am working full time!

What a nightmare! It gave me extreme rage-filled episodes everyday and got worse if I was late taking it by only an hour. It also did nothing to treat the depression and anxiety that I was prescribed it for, if anything it made it worse. I could not eat a portion size of anything during the time that I was taking it either: I would only eat a decent sized meal once a week.

I have been taking Prozac for 2 years and it helps but didn't quite get me to feeling good most of the time (just less bad than I was). Adding Wellbutrin (you can take both) has made all the difference. And it has really helped me focus on work. Prior to Wellbutrin I would start to work and then get quickly bored or distracted and do something else. I had a hard time just getting something started. Wellbutrin has made a very big change in this area. I still get distracted a little but not as much. I may ask to try 300mg when I go see my Dr. But I'm much better off than I was. I didn't even know that I had ADD symptoms, but now I think that's probably what I have had. I am so much happier. Only side effect I notice is that I seem to sleep harder.

It has really helped me be more positive, less anxious, and more focused at work. On rare occasion, when under unusual stress, I take 10 mg of Xanax (in addition to Welbutrin) to help combat my anxiety.  I took Prozac for two years prior to starting on Welbutrin, but it just made me feel emotionally numb and finally stopped working altogether. I have had no adverse side-effects from Welbutrin and have lost the extra weight I gained while on Prozac.  It has not increased my sex-drive (unlike some other reviewers); however, it hasn't diminished it either.  I would highly recommend this drug to anyone suffering from low-level depression; although, I know everyone reacts differently.  My 18-yr-old daughter, who has ADD (inattentive type), was recently diagnosed with depression as well.  She just started taking Wellbutrin this past week (75 mg/day initially, increasing to 150 mg/day next week).  Hopefully, it will help her as much as it has helped me.

I was almost ready to give up but then gave Wellbutrin a try.  The adjustment period was hardly noticeable.  I did have a few nights of restlessness and some night sweats in the first two weeks.  The only major side effect was a major increase in sex drive.  I already had a  high sex drive but this was ridiculous!  Just having thoughts of making love to my spouse brought me to the point of orgasm, while at work!  For a few days, I was going nuts with sexual desire.  Eventually, this side effect ended by the start of week three.  Now, after two months, I'm feeling much more calm and in control of my emotions.  Thoughts of suicide continued in the first few weeks.  Now, after a couple of months, those feelings are gone too.  I also no longer have any desire to smoke and other habitual desires are also gone.  My stuttering, and fast speech and anxiety are also more in control.  Overall, this is my miracle drug.  Can't say it will be the same for you, but for me, life is now grand and improving.

I eventually stopped taking Wellbutrin when my Celexa dose was increased to 60 mg which appeared to be the right dose/medication for me. I was recently reduced to 40 mg of Celexa due to new studies that no more than 40 mg should be taken due to risk of heart issues/death. I am now back on Wellbutrin at 300 mg/day due to the decreased dosage of Celexa. Wellbutrin has worked for me. Side effects included decreased appetite, a little weight loss initially and dry mouth. I am a smoker and I thought Wellbutrin might help with that too, however, I did not notice any decrease in cigarette cravings while on Wellbutrin. The only thing I STRONGLY caution is do not EVER take more than your prescribed amount of Wellbutrin. I overdosed by accident (took 600 mg in one day) about 2 years after I started taking it, it was the worst experience of my life. Hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia....I literally thought I was dead and everyone around me was a ghost. I ended up going to the ER because of it (I actually thought my dead body was at the hospital and I wanted to go there to wake myself up). NEVER, EVER overdose on this medication. You will be sorry! But again, taken as prescribed, I am pleased with it. 
1692$Depression$1/11/2014 10:49:51 AM$Reviewer: RxLisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been taking Wellbutrin XL 300 mg for about 5 weeks now (started on 150 mg).  This has been much more effective than any other antidepressant I've taken.  In the past 20 years I've been on Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft (with and without Abilify) and also Deplin.  The first couple of weeks, I was a bit more irritable, but was ok with it, because I cared about things again and was engaging again in life.  I was mostly irritated at how I had let everything go because I just didn't care or have the energy to do anything.  In the last couple of weeks, I have developed neck pain, headaches, and intermittently blurry vision, which all are listed possible side effects.  It's working so well for my depression at this point that I'm willing to wait a couple of months to see if the side effects go away.  I'm not sure if I've lost weight, but I'm cooking more often and eating less.  With all the other meds I've tried, it was the other way around.  All medications have side effects, these, for me are tolerable to be able to enjoy my young children and actually enjoy life again.  Before Wellbutrin, I was just kind of dragging myself through life.  I've had depression pretty much my entire adult life and tried it with and without antidepressants.  So far, With Wellbutrin XL, I feel like myself again for the first time in a very long time.

1720$Depression$11/3/2013 6:48:41 PM$Reviewer: wink, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was on Celexa 40 mg and felt great however being on this med I did gain some weight.  Co-workers suggest Wellbutrin and had weight loss effects and were very satisfied.  Thought I would try it.  I weaned off Celexa and started Wellbutrin 150 for two weeks but no satisfaction.  Increased to 300 by PCP and thought all was well.  One night about 9 I noticed I started itching at my ankle.  In an hour I had itchiness on legs and by 10 hives and welts on inner thights, backside, back of legs.  Lay awake until 3 am itching then noted hives and welts on abdomen, chest, underarms, under breasts and sides.  Became worried for spreading to my face or even tongue.  I drove to ER at hospital and treated with Benedryl and Prednisone immediately. 4 days later and I lost movement in my right thumb and hand very painful.  Went to ortho who have me injection and told me it was results from inflammationof the drug.  Today my hands are swollen and hurt badly and I am told it takes time to go thru system.  I am so dreadfully sorry that I switched medications and then again thank God for allowing me to live.  Never thought I would ever have a reaction and I guess time will heal.  I would rather be happy and healthy and perhaps a few pounds over weight than go thru what I have in the past week.

I started off with 150mg then after about a month they put me on 300mg along with zoloft because the wellbutrin alone wasn't helping (I will admit I did not have sexual dysfunction and it curved my appetite) After being on it for about two weeks I ended up having a seizure at work. Today marks a week since that happened and I had another one tonight. Please please please be careful with this drug. Look at the good and the bad reviews. I am not taking this medicine anymore because of what happened. I'm even terrified to drive in case I have another seizure.

Either they are not talking to their doctors or they need to get a different one who knows what they are doing. My NP who manages medications for a living starting me on this. I told her this morning, via email, I have had two nights with terrible sleep, waking up several times and feeling very awake! She told me if I can handle it try 2 more days otherwise stop taking it altogether. She didn't prescribe me a sleep aid. I can't believe some of the stories I hear on this about doctors. And if you are having side effects let your doctor know ASAP. Don't wait for your follow up. There is no need to suffer.

Suddenly grocery shopping or pumping gas is no big deal again. I'm able to think more clearly at work. I'm actually planning a vacation which, one month ago and for the past few years, would have seemed like climbing Mount Everest.  I'm just back to being me.  No better, no worse.

I stopped taking the other antidepressants and continued, but then couldn't afford the brand and started the generic. Awful; dry mouth, anger, sleeplessness, mood swings, and stomach aches; I feared long term effects and so I quit taking Celexa and bupropion over two weeks. It was truly horrible; crawly skin, agitation, depression, anger, disorientation and nausea. I lived in a bathtub for two days to calm my skin symptoms and calm my nerves. Six years later I still experience these same symptoms, although not as pronounced. I don't feel my brain/body is the same and I'm staying away from drugs now. Healthy diet, exercise and cognitive therapy as opposed to ""take the pill"". Being open with my friends and confessing feelings often helps. I still wake regularly agitated and upset/angry over something that is nothing later on when I'm rested and awake--so agitated I could be awake all night. I wouldn't do it again; I'd take care of health by going to a spa and getting verbal/understanding/relational therapy. Finding a decent counsellor is difficult, but persist. A mentor, a priest, a mature relative--these people can give a 'reality picture' or feedback so you can get grounded over time. It's not just understanding yourself; it's finding a real relationship that can go deeper than becoming a good social character. Someone to confide your soul with...don't stop looking but use your discrimination and don't just confide in anyone. Really know and watch the actions of this person for character and their own self-understanding. If you are really looking sincerely, someone will appear and not necessarily cost you $100. an hour. For me, it was a woman in my church. Good luck to you...

Wellbutrin has helped me drink less, stopped being depressed over who my family is not or if I'm liked by others, etc.  This year, 2013, My Insur won't cover brand name-cost$425.00 per mo!So I'm trying generic, 4 wks  now & it's HORRIBLE. after about a wk - almost daily I'm eating more, high anxiety, wierd thoughts, leg aches in calves, headaches; not every day, yet, enough I even get ringing in my ears.  The generic is only $5.00 per month.  WHAT CAN I DO TO GET MY INSURance to cover the brand name!! help!! Now I even think about drinking most every day & would like to start drinking at 11am!! I work. Why would insurance NOT cover what medically helps me?  Why are they covering what makes me sick! "
1791$Depression$4/24/2013 4:47:39 PM$Reviewer: MacAnn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"Started off on 150MG of a generic to the name brand for 2 weeks as recommended by my doctor for me to get used to it before increasing to 300MG. As soon as I started the increased dose, all the side effects came on. I went from being depressed sometimes to being constantly down. Sometimes I was unable to get out of bed and do the basic everyday things. I started having hallucinations, feeling disoriented and having blackouts. I used to be very active and worked out 5 days a week. I gained 20 lbs while I was on it. The more I excercise and watched my diet, the more weight I gained. My doctor insisted that I may have had a previous underlying condition not related to the drugs. She also said she would consult a neurologist on my behalf. While I waited for her feedback, I did some research online and saw that my symptoms may be seizures (which I never had before taking the drugs). She told me that the neurologist suggested I stopped the meds as it appears I was having seizures. Within 2 weeks after I stopped taking them, the symptoms stopped. Ironic that I may have ended up taking anti-seizure meds to fix the side effects of another drug that was supposed to help me. My doctor still insists that this is the best out there at this time. Would love to try the name brand but my insurance only covers generic at the co-pay price. If I want the original, I will have to pay almost $1000 per month which I cannot afford. "

I started taking buproprion when zoloft didn't seem to be working for me.  I have been suffering depression since my husband cheated on me.  Unlike zoloft and lexapro, I didn't gain a bunch of weight nor did I feel tired and disconnected all the time.  I actually feel like my old self, the jovial old self.  I feel as close to normal as any other anti-dep I have taken.  The side effects for me were dry mouth the first month and increased...yes increased libido.  For some reason this drug heightens my libido not in the sense that i want it more but a great sense of touch and excitability.  (Wonderful not complaining lol)  The best thing I like about this drug is that I don't feel like a zombie.  I feel in control of me still.

I started again (about 2 weeks) and I have great confidence at work now.  Only side effect for me is rapid heart rate.  My doctor will probably say I might to be on Wellbutrin XL for life.

My Dr. tried many antidepressants, Zoloft, Effexor, and some I cannot remember.  Effexor caused some improvement, but in the end I was almost hyper.  We tried Wellbutrin, I think this was in the mid-late 90's and I have never looked back.  I do not obsess on the negative, cry impulsively, or think suicidal thoughts.  I am 100% pleased, have had NO side effects.  Well, the one side effect was positive, I stopped smoking w ease, they started tasting zoo BAD!!!  I later went through the slow and sad death of my husband in 2010 and did not react overly as I most certainly would have.  I have nothing but good things to say about Wellbutrin!

My appetite decreased ,I had more energy sound good but the really bad side is. I experienced a title wave of emotions.I became so so angry and ruminated over all wrongs that had happened to me , my grief was raw, a new doctor put me on 5mg lexapro and cut the Wellbutrin in half, just started and will post my results.

I stopped taking it after I noticed that 3 days in a row I could not get out of bed. I felt like I was unable to control my movements. I could not use any of my motor skills and it felt like something heavy was holding me down. My doctor reported my symptoms to a neurologist who suggested that I may have been having seizures. Now I'm getting ready for an appointment to see the neurologist for an official diagnosis. I'm not sure if the name brand itself would have brought on the same results but I've been hearing too many negative feedback about the generic versions. Also not very pleased with my insurance for insisting that I take generic. The told me that if I want the name brand my copay would be about $300 for a 30 day supply (generic is only $15 for a 30 day supply). My doctor switched me to another newer brand which I am slowly adjusting to. So far the new meds allow me to sleep so I'm catching up on all that I missed while I was no the generic Welbutrin XL 300mg.

Some people seem to be under the impression that its a stimulant but no way (I am actually on add meds so I know the difference): just wait until you've been on it for a full month, then you'll see! You'll see that it's like any other antidepressant in that it turns you into an apathetic zombie only you'll be way less choosy and you'll eat anything in sight.  I also found that this stuff DID NOT help my ADD in ANY way, but then again I actually have add for reals and am not just self-diagnosing myself.  I believe this could help calm hyperactivity though, so maybe it's good ADHD.

I originally took 150mg once a day; moved up to twice a day but switched to 300mg slow release so I wouldn't forget to take one of the doses. I tried so many different drugs over the past 20 years that I've lost count and the side affects were often horrific. Once my psychologist recommended Wellbutrin and my psychiatrist concurred I have never switched and it is the only anti-depressant I take. I also dropped 20 lbs of the 30 the other drugs had caused me to gain. It has helped with ADD, SAD and the all encompassing symptoms of depression. There have been a few times during the years when I was unable to take it for several days in a row and you could tell but just one dose and I was back up feeling great. I'm sorry it doesn't work for everyone; it has so few uncomfortable side affects when compared to some of the newer drugs. But for those who have found relief I can tell you that after all these years I still have found relief. (My husband calls them my happy pills!)

1905$Depression$5/24/2012 2:58:57 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Tried Celexa for a while but its side effects were too severe, I quit taking it. Foggy head, slow thought process, disinterest in sexual relations, minimal positive effects. I am quitting smoking and may be Bipolar so we tried Wellbutrin XL, 150mg. Severely decreases my interest in cigarettes/nicotine. Does not affect my thought processes [after the first week or two], my intimate life, or my sleep [provided i take it in the morning]. I do seem to drop things more often, but that declines as time goes on. I feel normal. It's the perfect medication for me. I recommend discussing it with your doctor to anyone with more than one issue potentially going on, that focuses more on depression than anxiety attacks. [in my case, smoking, depression, potential bipolar, probably ADD]

I had taken prozac for a year and took my self off cold turkey. In that year I gained 15lbs and was starting to get worse.then I did my own resurch and looked up non ssri meds for depression (all ssri meds make you gain weight and want to sleep). I hated the side effects of prozac(sleeping) and the 6 weeks it took to clean out my liver and detox. I then went back to my dr. My depression was soo bad. I asked him about wellbutrin. I started at150 and now week 3 at 300. I'm more cheerfull around my children. I'm having awsome sex again!! Working out, doing my yoga that I love and enjoying everything I missed doing. The only thing that I can say I don't enjoy is the smell of my sweat. Other than that I have high hopes for this medication.

How can this drug be on the market?  I have never had to be committed to a mental health ward in my life. This drug is scary and I would not recommend it to be taken by anyone.

I could not control the shaking in my hands. Insomnia was awful, I would wake up between 1am & 3am and not be able to get back to sleep for hours! It never helped with depression or anxiety.

1915$Depression$4/21/2012 4:30:52 PM$Reviewer: Olythia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"Started these about 2 years ago after being  desperate because none of those that act on serotonin had worked for me. Best thing I ever did! I researched it on-line and found the ratio of people praising it to hating it was much more favourable than most other anti-depressants. Problem: I'm in the UK and it is only licensed for giving up smoking. So I have to order it from Europe or USA. I started by taking just a quarter of one 150mg tab and working up to the full dose by day 7. (different for everyone of course)

Doing it this way made it much easier on the side-effects which for me were itchy rash on my hand and foot and difficulty getting to sleep maybe a bit of nausea but I found if I  ate some food with them it helped -even though my research said it shouldn't affect. I have read that taking a quarter of a tablet and building up gradually to lessen side-effects doesn't work. It really does for me. Bupropion has made me feel completely ""normal"" I didn't feel like I was on medication at all, until recently. After about a year and half I found I got occasional head pains. Not a headache as such. If I lay down on my front suddenly to watch television or something like that i would get a sharp pressure-like pain. I would keep still or slowly sit up and it would pass. after a few months I gradually started to get a slight hang-over feeling for a few hours most days. without any changes to my diet etc. I don't normally get headaches. My delivery was very delayed recently and I literally ran out. I was very worried what would happen with suddenly stopping (i could not get any from the doctor of course) Nothing happened so I stayed off them for two months. I can now very slightly feel anxiety on waking up that I used to get but only slightly so I decided to start again rather than wait until it gets bad. Today is the first day and I have a bit of that slight tightness in the head feeling. Anyone else had similar?"

After a month doc increased to 300 mg and what a disaster. My heart was racing , felt jittery, and the worst was the insomnia. I slept 2 hours a night before I couldn't take it anymore. I went back to 150 mg but still can't sleep. Right now it's 3:30 am and not sleepy at all.

Increased because I wasn't feeling as good any more.  Can't say I'm feeling much better, the sleeplessness has been terrible.  I'm seriously considering going back to the lower dose.
I originally started on Wellbutrin XL after participating in a double blind drug study for depression.  Wellbutrin combined with Cymbalta was the study administrator's best guess as to what I had been taking. This is not a usual drug combination, but it has done wonders for me. I am able to hold down a full time job in an extremely detailed position.  I'm known at work for my calmness! "

I am just now seeing a difference. As each individual is different so do I believe how long or how soon it takes for antidepressant to kick in. I did experience some "" sudden anger"" moments but those too are starting to go away. I had been on Prozac for many years and it was not working anymore so doc prescribed wellbutrin. I think the transision between the two drugs is what caused some of my uneasy feelings but is better now. My advice is, give the drug time to get in your system before dismissing it. As stated everyone is different and it may just take longer for some to feel the effectiveness . It's helped me so far and anticipate it getting better everyday."

The problem I'm having now is, instead of lack of sex drive I'm like a 16 year old again (but I last just as long as well). I don't know if switching to this medication has brought life back into certain parts of my body that i had forgotten about (doubtful) or the medication is making me SUPER sensitive. Either way, I don't like it. Also, I get agitated fast and I'm slightly more emotional. Looking for alternative medication... any suggestions?? Anyone?

They gave me steroids and benadryl IV and kept me overnight for the chest pains. Got better, went home next day and woke up following morning with my face and eyes swollen shut, fingers and hands were swollen and throat was shutting off, couldn't swallow and hard to breathe, so I went back to ER to get more steroids and Benadryl, still itchy. Finally went away later that night. What an experience!!! I will never take Welllbutrin again. One good thing about Wellbutrin it did take my appetite away. I am going to miss that part of it.

It made my husband happy, but being that I couldn't get enough I went outside the marriage to be satisfied. It almost seemed to put me in a bipolar state. It never happened before and it never happened since. Keep in mind I am not blaming this all on the drug because I was feeling like i wasn't getting enough attention at home and these other men provided that for me. It just seems an odd coincidence that this all started 4 weeks after i was put on wellbutrin. No problems since i got off the medication.

I have to take this medication in the morning, otherwise it's hard to get to sleep at night. And I'm carrying around several extra pounds, but I think that all depression meds make you gain weight. 

After reading some of these reviews, it's obvious that everyone reacts differently to this medication as far as ""side effects"" are concerned. For the first week after I started taking it, side effects were a little rough...my hands shook really bad at times, I had a hard time sleeping, and I was a little nauseated. After my body adjusted to it (and it takes about a week) the symptoms subsided & everything was fine.

On the plus side ~ after I'd been taking Wellbutrin for about 6 months, I quit smoking. One of the nice little side effects of this medication. ; )

If you have depression and haven't tried Wellbutrin yet, give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.

2014$Depression$9/4/2011 7:10:37 PM$Reviewer: depressedanxious, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$5$I took Welbutrin for about 5 months for major depressive disorder, and it gave me more energy and gave me the motivation to get more things done around the house, which, in turn, made me feel better. And unlike Zoloft, it caused no sexual side effects. However, it eventually made my throat feel really wierd, to the point that all I could do was think about my throat continuiously. Needless to say, I had to stop taking it.

I went from bad to great. But lately i've notice i want to kill everyone! My partner and I never fought, never doubted each other and always loved on each other. After taking this we were fighting constantly, I seem to be constiantly angry I didn't want anything to do with him or, work or even the house. I have no amotions except anger. All I can say is I hope that if you try this then expect the worse, hope for the best!

It is the only drug that did not make me sleepy or give me a headache like the class of SSRI'S(Prozac). My Dr added Topamax for some compulvice issues.

From the beginning this medication made it impossible for me to fall asleep at night.  My Clonazepam was increased which just makes it harder to get up in the morning.

My moods were better, my sex drive increased but I have gained 3 pounds(no change in appetite) and after several doctor visits, MRI's and a final visit to a neurologist I was told to discontinue this after nearly passing out when driving.  It feels as though I am in a fog and everything around me is twirling...and this comes on suddenly.  Hoping it is not the medication as it has done wonders for me."

Overall, I noticed a huge improvement in my mood, my energy level had extremely increased, and my appetite decreased. However, anxiety hasn't completed disappeared. While I use to have an anxiety attack, and then feel better once it passed- I now am in the lingering ""is it coming? When is it going to come"" panic feeling. Also, I believe this pill is mixing with my menstrual cycle. I would experience the normal/moderate emotional stage, however since I starting taking this I've become a hysteric, crying women for 5 days a month. Also, when I take stand pain relievers, it makes me extremely dizzy and makes my brain feel hot (only way to describe it)."

I had previously tried Zoloft but had to discontinue due to the side effects.  After about three weeks, it seems the black cloud of depression has lifted.  I have the excessive sweating side effect but it's ok.  A positive side effect is that it has increased my sex drive by about 500%, so that is a plus.  I am only on the 150 Mg dose, once per day, but don't know if it needs to be increased or not.

I was prescribed this as well as other antidepresants for over a year now. I feel much better than before I started taking them. I am under a very large amount of stress most of the time and the MD and my Phych doctor recommend that I stay on 300 mg a day, once in the morning and once at night. I also take 150mg of Venlafaxine HCL er plus 1 mg of Alprozolam. And yes you do lose your sex drive. Which almost all of the antidepressants do. Overall I do benefit from the drug.

For those of you who have benefited from it, I am truly happy. Unfortunately, I did not. I have never experienced a med with so many and so intense side effects. The first couple of weeks were actually OK, but once it built up in my system I experienced severe headaches, dizziness, ear ringing, nausea, night sweats, insomnia, and nightmares. The drug also caused my system to violently reject ANY other central nervous system drug I put in my body. Couldn't have a drink, a cup of coffee, or even take an ibuprofen without feeling just awful. So I stopped. That was 2 years ago. Not the end of the story, however. Every 2 months or so I get what I call ""flashbacks"" where I have episodes of the exact same symptoms that last about 3 days. This stuff tried to take my body over and it still doesn't want to let go. I curse the day I took it."

I wish I could still take this med, now Dr and I have to start searching again. Meds work differently for everyone, it is YOUR responsibility to know the side effects and SPEAK UP, make a nuisance of yourself if necessary.

After a divorce, losing both parents (within 7 months) and the recent loss of both my dogs, Wellbutrin just doesn't seem to be effective anymore. My doc tried adding different medications along with it, but weird side effects (from the newer additions) have kept me on Wellbutrin. I'm ready for a change as I think this has lost some effectivness.
Overall, no real side effects with Wellbutrin XL except for losing a few pounds, but nothing major. Just wish it would have kept on working. Maybe my issues are just too much for it."

Trouble Sleeping- I have the best sleep since I stated taking it.  Now I do have the dry mouth, strange taste in the mouth, but that’s all taken care of with a piece of gum.So are these considered uncomfortable, I dont know. I am taking the generic version, so as for the depression, I feel mellow and calm while at work. But when I get home, I feel like I took a energy shot. I don’t feel moody any more, and I am spending more time with my kids outside, showing my husband more affection. So far this is the best thing I’ve been on.

I could not get a good breath in- it was tight and no matter how hard I tried, it would take 5 or 6 deep breaths/yawns before I got one breath, then the process would start over. I had chest pain/tightness and an incredibly fast heartbeat. I exercise regularly and am only 24, so this was unusual. I ended up in the ER because my chest hurt so bad I worried I was damaging my heart. They couldn't find anything and wouldn't believe my generic accusation, until a social worker called a psychiatrist who confirmed my symptoms as a common side effect from this generic. I took Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression 8 years ago, and I was fine. I know my body has changed, but I believe this generic may be dangerous for some. With coupons, my co-pay will be $230... so now I will be either fighting or beginning again the struggle to find an adequate medication."

My doctor thought perhaps it would help with my obsessive/compulsive behavior.  It did not do anything for that.  I guess it helped with depression somewhat.  The problem arose when I noticed any time I'd lie down, whatever thought was in my head would vaporize.  Trying to remember exactly what I'd been thinking would not get it back to save my soul.  Sometimes, I would write down my thoughts, then lie down just to see if they'd go poof (they would)---at least I could read about what was on my mind just minutes before.  However, even reading the subject would not return the thoughts themselves.  When I brought this up to my doctor, he said, ""Uh-oh.""  Apparently, I was suffering seizures on Wellbutrin, which caused my mind to reset to 0.  I was immediately taken off this drug and another was tried--and another--whichever had the best sales pitch.  I ultimately did find an extended-release antidepressant that works perfectly for my particular needs.  "

According to one article, it's the patented membrane that allows for extended release that seems to be the problem. Apparently some generics don't use the same XR method, which can lead to a huge release of the active ingredient followed by little to no release. Wellbutrin has a membrane-like wall that allows a constant release, but many generics use pills that just dissolve slowly. Other bodily functions can speed up or slow down the release (i.e., amount of food in stomach).

I've always been lucky in life and have had a great family and basically everything a child could ask for. Although, I've had some tramatic experences in my childhood my parents where in the process of getting a divorce, my father committed sucide when i was nine, and i had to move 3 years later due to expensive living in New York. After i moved  to the south it was a major culture shock and sunk into a depression. I was always a bigger taller girl which affected my self esteem, when i was 13 i weighted around 135 lbs and was 5'4. Over two years i gained 60 lbs and 3 cup sizes and am now 5'7, thankfully i still had a shaply hourglass proportion. Finally when i was around 195 lbs. i was severly depressed and though ""how did this happen"" and ""why did i let myself go"" Everyone said you look fine your a beautiful girl. Thankfully not to toot my own horne, but i am an attractive girl and look very mature for my age but that didn't matter i felt horrible. In 09 my doctor prescribed me Prozac 20 mg and i didn't like the though of being on medicine so i didn't take it reguarly  which is bad. It made my tired and it just did not work. My doctor was a prozac pusher lol. To make a long story short in October 2010 i wanted another advise and saw another doctor and he put me on WELLBUTRIN XL 150 Mg later uped me to 300mg. I though wow thats so much medicine compared to 20mg but he explained to me how it works differently and it has different mg and 150 isn't so much. 4 Months later now Feb 2011 i feel great and have lost 45 lbs in 3 months. The medicine isn't  a miracle drug or a weight loss drug. It just helps you feel like yourself, actually i felt like i wasn't on meds. It helps motivate you to help yourself and get back on track and boosts energy. It severly decressed my hunger which was a super plus and motivated me to start working out. 4 months later with watching what i eat (even over the winter holidays) an"

It does give me a little bit of energy. Everyone is different and might have different side effects. but i love the way this drug has made me feel.

I'm still lounging around, not wanting to do anything, not wanting to see anyone, crying most of the time. This drug is a waste. Yeah it helped in the first few months, but then it stopped so they bumped me up to 300mg, which helped, then stopped, and now i'm up to 450, which made me have tons of side effects, so they dropped me down to 300mg. It's such a waste of a drug to take, and a waste of my money, i wouldn't even think of recommending it to anyone.
2113$Depression$1/22/2011 12:05:52 PM$Reviewer: DonnaD, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I had depression because of several difficult events taking place in my life, in my job, illness in the family, etc., crying occasionally, feelings of hopelessness, like I didn't want to go on with the events and was angry at the world for what I was going through. That's all changed now. I am very happy with the effects. I started at 150 mg for about 2 weeks and didn't feel much... then started on 300 mg once a day and voila, I felt a strong difference in my mood, no more nagging negative thoughts, increased ability to not only handle the stress, but become a strong leader in my family and help others develop a more positive attitude and perspective. I recommend this drug, but like everyone else says, hopefully not as a permanent way to deal with life. Once some of the challenges I am going through have been resolved, I plan to slowly taper off of this drug altogether. It is the ONLY drug that I take.

Basically it causes sexual side effects and fatigue and does little else for my mental or emotional state. A fairly safe drug side effect wise I guess but I am still massively depressed. ANyone know of a drug to stop the ANTS and NOT cause weight gain? Been on this drug for about 3 years. Not really loving it. Oh, if you take it in the morning it DOES cause sleepiness and shakes for a couple hours.

It's been years since I've been on this drug and I still have muscle issues that are there permenantly. I HATE THIS DRUG! The doctors don't even know why my body reacted like that to the drug or what to do for my muscle twitching/damage.

I used this one and I was able to do the things that I needed.  I need it to focus and stay on task.  It also gives me a bit of energy.  It does come with its side effects just like the rest and you will have to determine is it worth it in the end for you.  In my case the benefits out weigh the effects.  I have dry mouth and headaches and some tension at times, but most of the time I am mellow.  This is very important to me as I hate high strung people even my self when I can't control my racing thoughts and brain fog.  It is a great drug in my opinion.

I've been very satisfied with the results. My mood has improved and I feel like I have a lot more energy. Prior to starting the medication, I was having trouble getting motivated to do just about everything, and I've found that it's been a lot easier to get myself to do things (e.g. washing the dishes) than it was before. As far as side effects, I experienced some insomnia for the first few days, but that was completely gone within a week. I didn't experience any other adverse side effects.

I tried to ween off a couple mo.s ago and my mood was fine but I was experiencing very low blood pressure, disorientatation,and dizzy spells that lasted for hours. I cannot say that this was directly related to withdrawal. My Dr. could not find any reason for these symptons. I went back on my meds after that, because of personal problems as well, and they seem to work better now, I think I was getting used to the dosage... overall it seems to work well, I do still get irritable which could be beause I don't take my 1st dose right away when I wake up, and I forget or have to skip my second dose because it is too late in the day to take it..

2160$Depression$10/21/2010 8:29:38 PM$Reviewer: medwisegirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Wellbutrin has been great for me. All I wanted to do before taking this was sleep, and when I was up I was grouchy and irritated. I actually like getting up in the morning and enjoy my day. Everyone around me is much happier as well. I tried Cymbalta first and it didn't fit my specific needs, and in fact worsened my depression. There are different medicines for different types of depression. Wellbutrin works on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is for motivation and acivating the reward center in the brain. I wouldn't discourage or encourage the use of this drug. It's your doctors job, depending on your depression symptoms, to match you with the best medicine for you. You need not listen to people that say not to try it, everyone is different. This medicine may or may not work for you. Treating depression is not an exact science, due to our lack of knowledge about the brain. Finding the right depression medicine will take trial and error, which can be very frustrating. Stick with it and you will find a medicine that works for you.

General Dysthymia & Sleeping Problems

Pros:
The increased energy levels and motivation have really helped.  The initial euphoric/hyper feelings dissipate quickly but are still enjoyable for the first few days.  Bad thoughts and anxiety tend to pass much more quickly.  Bad moods and sadness are not nearly as ""low"" as they were before.  It makes it much more easy to combat problems instead of dwelling on them.  Improved sleep seems to be a result of the other effects.

Cons:
Constipation is sometimes a problem, but this can be dealt with through proper diet.
I also get more thirsty throughout the day.

Neutral:
Really reduces hunger pangs and overall appetite.  This has been very helpful for losing the weight put on while depressed.  It may not be good for those who are already lean."

I kept thinking of ways to kill myself, my son, and my unborn child. It was crazy, I couldn't go anywhere or function at all. So my doctor put me on this and after a few months added Celexa and it worked miracles. I was able to go back to college to finish my degree and both of my sons have a mother who is totally functional. The only side effect I noticed was appetite suppressant and since I am very overweight I think it's a great one to have! I no longer binge everynight!

It works great. The pharmacist has several manufacturers he can go to for the one that works better for the patient so I would try different generics until I found a suitable one. I also take 225 mg. of Effexor XR along with the Wellbutrin and Buspirone (generic Buspar). I recently switched my Effexor to generic and it is working great. I guess because I have been on them so long, I do not have any adverse effects.My doctor is switching my Buspar to Xanax because the Buspar has affected my vision and I am experiencing involuntary muscle contractions and jerking movements. I tried Cymbalta once before and I felt suicidal so back to the Wellbutrin for me.

2241$Depression$6/15/2010 11:54:53 AM$Reviewer: abirata, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Wellbutrin had side effects at the beginning - the worst of which were insomnia and constipation. The insomnia abated after about 3 weeks of treatment and I take a fiber supplement to deal with the constipation. It also abates with time but never completely goes away. Another side effect at firt was a general ""hyper"" feeling but that also wore off after a few weeks. Unlike the SSRIs, Wellbutrin does not make me feel ""drugged” - I feel emotions, good and bad - but the difference I notice while taking the drug is that I tend not to brood or obsess over negative events or ideas, it is easier to let them pass. I think it has also made me more able to open up to talking about my situation because I don’t think I have to reign in my “bad” emotions so tightly as I don’t fear them getting out of control. It is easier to work through them, and talk about them. Wellbutrin by itself is a great help, but by far the most effective treatment for me has been talk therapy. Depression runs in the family. I did not start seeking treatment until age 27 when it became overwhelming  and was affecting my work and relationships. The first course of treatment my physician prescribed were SSRIs (Paxil, Prozac and Zoloft), but I could not tolerate the side effects nausea and drowsiness, but the worst, that although my depression was dampened, so were all my emotions. These side effects never abated. I became even more distant from people I loved and could not function effectively at work because it was difficult to concentrate. I had great doubts about all of the anti-depressants after those experiences, and am skeptical of drug claims and the pharmaceutical industry in general but have to admit that Wellbutrin has been very effective. I know that SSRIs are very effective for many  people - I just wanted to share that portion of my experience because I believed that because they did not work for me, nothing would. I am glad to be proven wrong."

I really like the fact that I don't feel like I need to sleep all the time which I did when I was on Celexa. I also like the way it helps boost my mood and has definitely helped with my sex drive that had been non-existent with Celexa. However, I am waiting for some of the side effects to wear off. My doctor said to give it a few more weeks before I decide if I like it or not. From day two I have been dizzy. It is better now than it was, but still feeling it. I also have been very nauseas and I have had a mild headache, kinda feels like a sinus headache. I also have had hot flashes and night sweats and my ADHD is actually worse. I find that odd since this drug can also be taken for ADHD. 
If the side effects fade I am all for this medicine, but if they don't there is no way I can keep taking it. I have also had some trouble sleeping, but as long as I take at least half of my dose of Neuratin and Buspar a few hours before bed I am fine. If I forget to take it early I can't take it at all because I need 12 hours before getting up to get those two out of my system or I can't find it hard to wake up on time. I'm gonna give it one more week and if the side effects don't fade it is back to the doc for our next trial and error run."

At 30 years of age, I never in my wildest dreams thought I would need such a medication.  But after starting a family, work and daily activities, I found myself overwhelmed and it was difficult to deal with people and situations. It was enough for me to consult with a doctor and see what was out there to help. My symptoms in plain english included, not wanting to be around friends or functions that normally I would attend, loss of interest at work, easily distracted by anything, sleepless nights, picking at my husband over every little thing (which was causing problems.  But since I've been taking this medicine my relationships with people overall have improved dramatically, I have more energy and I am less of an emotional eater.  I could go on and on.  I love this medication and I'm a happier person!

It started with severe headaches, fuzzy thoughts and just the general feeling of being uncomfortable. Last Thursday I started taking it twice a day and have been in bed for the last three days with such severe muscle aches and off and on temperature with ringing in one ear.  I even had to pull over when driving home from work on Friday because I kept feeling ""blackness"".  I am also a runner and since starting this medication, my legs have felt heavy and sore to the bone, not even able to finish a short training session.  I have not taken any more of the medication since this happened and am going to the doctor this morning!  I am sure that she will say it is a virus, but I know that is definitely was the Wellbutrin because the side effects were immediate. Has anyone else had these side effects?"

After the 2nd week, I started having trouble sleeping. By the end of last week I started having a strange feeling like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. I went to my doctor, who informed me that I was experiencing heart palpitations. The last day I took the medication (3 days ago) I experienced a panic attack while at work, and have since experienced 2 more panic attacks, each with worsening symptoms. Today is the 2nd day without medication and I am still having the palpitations... Although Wellbutrin helped with my mood, I would taking being depressed any day over the side-effects I have experienced.

I'm not sure about this drug yet. I was taking 150 mg SR twice a day for 2 months and really felt not difference.  Previously I was taking prozac for about 4 months which helped my mood but left me feeling so tired and lethargic; therefore I switched.  Now I'm taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg (for one week)  and still have only felt little relief.  The worst side effect for me is abdominal pain.  Day 2 of taking the new dose I started feeling bad stomach pain.  Still has not got better but I'm trying to wait it out to see if it will help my mood.
2277$Depression$4/23/2010 8:09:54 PM$Reviewer: ThereIsASolution, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was on SRI's for 13 years, and was exhausted all the time, barely functioning, even though the dark depression was gone. I slowly switched from Effexor to Wellbutrin, I take 400mg in the morning now, then added Xanax .25 at night for anxiety. The effect was startling - in a few days, I hate much more energy and motivation. I used to have to take naps at work at lunchtime because I felt like I was going to almost faint - at least 2-3 times a week. I have done that for 10 minutes once in 2 years. I was able to do 5 years of taxes that I was too tired to tackle before, and I can function much better in general now. Made a huge difference in my life, night and day. Wellbutrin affects dopamine levels much more than most of the SSRI's, I believe that's the reason. I am a recovering alcoholic (26 years sober), and drinking affects dopamine too, so I can see why Wellbutrin works for me.

Started at 150 for about 3 weeks and then went to 300 for over a week now. I do not suffer from anxiety and i am not sure how this would ever be a medication for the treatment of anxiety ? It would seem to me that this medication could very well increase anxiety for those who have anxiety related issues. 
What it has done for me : Got me out of bed instead of sleeping all day for no real reason i could think of . It jump-started me so to speak. I have way more get up and go along with reduced anger,i got away from this senseless sadness,constant rehashing issues i have no control over and this is what i should be.
Hope this continues for me. I get my 6 ,7 or 8 hours of sleep and i am ready to go.I really have nothing negative to say at this point for me."

Go to PCP & Psychiatrist and was told that it was extremely rare (I'm often the exception to the rule) I stopped them for a few days to see if the ringing would subside. BAD MOVE!!  My mood immediately went south and the crying came back.  I started back after 5 days and in 24hrs I was back to ""normal"".  I  have taken countless anti depression meds over the years.

I've been on Zoloft and didn't really get much out of it. Recently came off Prozac because my side effects were really rare and severe. Wellbutrin gives me energy during the day and helps me wake up with a more positive feeling. Issues that used to send me into a bad funk aren't so bad anymore. I find that I rebound from problems quicker and am able to move on. The only side effects I'm experiencing is a little dry mouth and occasional constipation, but it's all be manageable.

The first time I was extremely depressed and was crying all the time, hated my life, hated my job, etc. etc. I feel that the Wellbutrin it helped each time and I did not need to stay on it permanently. My personal experience with this drug was positive. I did experience constipation however, and this is easily prevented by adding TWO apples to your daily food intake and drinking at least 1 ounce of water, for every 2 pounds of body weight. I will actually be looking to go back on this anti-depressant again soon as I am in the middle of divorce and things are starting to overwhelm me. But I do not feel like I ""need"" it. It is great if you have adult ADHD, or just trouble concentrating/getting things done. I am a superstar at work when I am taking this stuff.  "

I am no longer taking it because I don't feel like I need it now. I went from 300mg. and gradually reduced dosage. A few side effects of anxiety and feeling ""strange"" but were not bad and didn't last long. I believe Psycotropic drugs are like women. Some can help some people and some can't. They are also like men. They are faithful to some and not so faithful to others. Depends on the make-up and physiology of the person.  All in all, not bad and helped me out of depression when I needed it the most. "

The side effects are annoying (get less sleep now, increased libido, possible increase in anxiety) and really became noticeable at 300mg. It hasn't hosed me over like just about every other anti-depressant I have taken (and I've tried a couple dozen at this point) so it's the one I have to settle for. I'm taking the SR version in case my IBS acts up. To the person that asked about taking all of the SR's at once, they release the medicine over a 12 hour period, so I have to wonder about that. I spread mine out (loosely every eight hours). On the other hand, having a higher dose during the day may be a good thing. Sounds like you should ask your doctor about this.

I started out taking 150mg, then after 5 years, switched to 300mg.  I have never had a problem on this medication.  No side effects, no sexual dysfunction.  The reason why I like this drug so much is because it's one that you can just stop taking and there aren't any withdrawal symptoms.  Although, after 10 years of taking it, I think it's stopped working.  Now I have to figure out what to do.

I took the brand name, and switched to generic when the price skyrocketed. SIX days later I had to return to the brand name. The FDA site tells you the whole story. The thing is that anyone who is prescribed the generic brand for the first time won't know it's not working, and the prescribing physician presumably doesn't otherwise s/he would not have presctibed it.

My first episode of depression was treated with Wellbutrin and the medication was very effective.  Went off when planning to become pregnant. Recently returned to using Wellbutrin, orginally at 150mg which wasn't as effective as the 300mg dose. Side effects have included: nausea, weight loss, poor appetite, occasional headaches. Although I initially lost weight due to the depression I now have to really force myself to eat and find myself going hours without food only to feel terrible due to low blood sugar levels. Also noticed some increase in anxiety symptoms. I am considering going back to the 150mg dosage.  I discovered that adding SAMe supplements have helped as well.

My ""mild"" depression includes a general feeling of lethargy, difficulty motivating myself to do simple things, feeling overwhelmed with the thought of completing simple tasks.  I was functioning in life but at a  lower level.  Anyway onto the med review:  MD prescribed 100 mg 1x a day and then told to work up to 200 mg 1x a day after a week.  First week at 100 mg....tons of headaches, crazy dehydration, wierd flighty feeling, nauseus, lack of appetite.  I convinced myself to stick with it at uped my dose.  Experienced 4 days of the worst headaches of my life.  I had to quit completely b/c I couldn't function.  Waited a week and began 100 mg once a day again and this time no headaches,  I am sticking with my low dose since it seems to give me the extra lift I need.  I don't feel medicated or foggy.  The biggest thing to disappear was the feeling of being overwhelmed.  I feel like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.  As for side effects now...I have a tendency to get dehydrated more quickly when on the meds so I have to really drink alot of water.  If I don't hydrate the headaches follow.  Initially my appetite completely disappeared.  Now it's less but not significantly.  This med does seem to reduce cravings in general.  I am not a drinker but had a couple drinks (despite my better judgement) on NY's Eve.  The next day or 2 I felt like the meds weren't working.....felt lethargic, just down.  Definately not worth the drinks of Champagne so I'll abstain 100% for now.  I am at a much lower dosage then is prescribed for most people but it works for me.   Main con i that I do notice that I can become agitated quicker.  I am usually the most laid back person, almost too laid back.  So for me it's not a big deal but I wouldn't recommend this med to anyone who has a tendency to anger easily or experiences anxiety."

I took the 2 a day version for 5 months before not being able to stand the headaches anymore.  I also felt very jittery the first week or so.  I recently switched to the extended release medication and my headaches are gone!  My doctor said that maybe the large dose twice a day was like a fire that then burned out over & over.  I would definitely recommend the extended version of this drug.  In the past I had taken zoloft and I did feel great.  A little too great.  I gained 30 lbs over 6 months and had NO libido.  And I couldn't sleep at night to boot!  I did love how I felt, but I had to sleep and I didn't want to take a medication to sleep every night on top of the zoloft.  I like the welbutrin better for me because it only lessened my symptoms enough to be able to wrap my head around the issues in my life that were completely overwhelming me.  It didn't mask the problems as I felt the zoloft did.  Only helped me feel like I could compartmentalize them and start to deal with them.  Definitely make your doctor give you the extended release!

My overall experience has been good, especially in the beginning. However, after insurance forced me to start using the generic, I have found it to be less effective than the original formula. I'm thinking about going back to brand name even though I have to pay for it. I hope it's the generic formula and not due to tolerance build up that is causing the waning effects.

I feel more focused and in control...finally getting myself back and able to smile.  I have completely stopped smoking cold turkey, which was not initially intended, but a definite benefit. I have not had any side effects, except some weight loss due to appetite control, which is also a welcome benefit. I went up to 300mg after 4 weeks, but found it to make me very irritable, so I came back down to 150mg. After visiting my doctor, we decided to add 10mg of the generic Prozac to my med regimen, since I felt that I was very ""indifferent"" and not really finding the ""joy"" in things.

I remembered how much better it was than the others. When I felt that things were getting bad again I asked my Dr if he could try me back on that. I immediately had more energy, better attentin span, weight loss and better sex. I am only taking half the dose prescribed, 150mg in the morning. I am now at a plateau, so I may begin taking my second dose of 150 mg early afternoon. The only side effects are slight hand tremors, some irritability and my heart races especially if I have a few drinks. Not enough side effects to give it up. Really, if the other drugs you are taking make you feel lifeless, ask your Dr to try this. When I went off this the first time I had way less withdrawl sickness than the others.

I have been medicatited most of the last 10 years. I was perscribed Welbutrin, and Celexa to take place of prozac, which hasn't really been effective for 2 years.I also started taking Clonopin 6 months ago, .5mg 1 or 2 a day. The Clp I like it seems to really help calm me. I take it around 1 pm before my kids come home from school! My primary care dr. retired so my new dr wasn't comfortable refilling the clonopin because it can be addictive! Who cares if I'm taking it everyday anyway? So I go see a real phsyc. dr. f9or help. The first 2 days I was very tense and jumpy had hot flashes. After that the migrain hit. I have suffered from headaches in the past so didn't relate it to the meds for a couple days. But after 4 days of severe pain in the top of my head, I spoke to my Dr. who said a small percent of people will experience migrain from the Wb. The next morning I had an ice pack on my neck at six am. I took only the Celexa that day and realized around 11am my headache was almost gone! I still had tension and restlessness dry mouth. Today I didn't take anything until about 11 am I took 1/2 clonopin to take the edge off. I am actually feeling good today. I slept better last night. That helped alot! I see him in one week, during that time I will try go solo as much as possible. (I have my clonopin if I get too out of hand!) Then I will ask my dr to try effexor xl. I was on this for 5 years before I got pregnant with my youngest. I did very well after the 1st couple weeks of side effects. Hope this helps someone. I know I go to the reviews to see how pills effect different people. It helps. We all have a different chemistry and a single goal in common...TO FEEL GOOD!

Before taking Wellbutrin, I wasn't a depressed person, but it caused me to become suicidal and ended up overdosing and was hospitalized due to severe seizures.  I was diagnosed in my early 20s with clinical depression, and was put on Wellbutrin XL again to treat it.  It made a major difference in the first 2 months while on it, but after that it became useless and I became more suicidal than ever.  My appetite was very off while on this medication - I could go for two days without feeling hungry and would literally have to force myself to eat.  My anxiety worsened on the medication as well.  I just switched to Zoloft today. Hopefully that will help!

It has made a major positive difference in my life in the way I handle things; I am able to think much more clearly and rationally.  For the first few years I combined the medication with therapy.  I was taking 225 mg when I started and have had to increase it once to 300 mg/ day.  I currently take the Wellbutrin 300 XL.  Word of caution on the generic version of Wellbutrin 300 XL - I tried it when it was approved and found after a few months that I was becoming depressed again.  The generic did not work for me; the tablet may have the same amount of medication but the packing (what makes up the rest of the pill)is completely different than the brand name.  For me it seemed like instead of medication being steadily administered to my system throughout the day it hit all at once, thus the return of the depression.  I was hoping to be able to save some money with the generic but it is worth it to me to take the brand name.

The first time I tried it, I noticed the hair loss after 2 weeks.  I stopped taking it for about 6 months.  Then, I gave it another try, thinking maybe it wasn't the Wellbutrin.  As soon as I started taking it again, my hair started coming out by the handfuls, right about 1.5 weeks into taking it.  My Doctors have never heard of this side effect, but I know for a fact it's caused by this drug.

On the occasion that I did have sex it was embarrassing because my orgasms were so fierce and I would end up drenching my partner. It got to be too much for me to control myself and I had to stop taking it after I developed bad headaches and nosebleeds.

I tried nearly every antidepressant on the market in the 80s. Tri-cyclics, MAOIs, SSRIs, etc. The only drug that initially helped me was Trazodone. When the effects of that started to wane I went to a doctor that prescribed Wellbutrin for me. I immediately received outstanding help from this drug. For the first time since I was a child I felt like a ""normal"" person. It helped with every facet of The Monster, Depression. I have been taking this drug for twenty years and I will never give it up. It and the doctor who prescribed it gave me my life back. It also helps somewhat with Fibromyalgia and CFIDS. It once   helped to keep me awake. I no longer get that benefit from the drug and am taking Provigil to try to remain alert.

I've been taking Wellbutrin XL for over 4 years. I also was taking Cymbalta (didn't notice any help from that drug), but stopped due to the perceived ineffectiveness over 6 months ago with no negative effects. WB however seemed to help level out my depression. Instead of the very deep lows they became less severe over time until my mood was manageable. When I began taking WB I immediately noticed a decrease in appetite and lost several pounds right away. In time my appetite came back and have gained the weight back. It also helped with my cravings for habits I had stopped years ago, e.g., smoking, drinking, drugs, etc. If I wanted to stop smoking, drinking or drugs I would HIGHLY recommend WB as an adjunct therapy. I see why ZYBAN is prescribed for smoking cessation! I have tried weening back to 150mg from the 300mg dose I take daily before bed, but noticed mood changes within a week so I went back to 300mg, not wanting to fix it if it wasn't broken. It seems as though I may have to take something for the rest of my life as I have been a lifetime depression sufferer. The only side effect I suffer from is that I think it contributes to sexual dysfunction, but depression itself could be the main culprit. There is no free lunch with any medication. Your mileage may vary ;-).

2482$Depression$7/24/2009 3:46:23 AM$Reviewer: Kathy O, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have suffered from depression most of my life.  In my early 20’s I started see a psychiatrist.  I received talk therapy as well as antidepressants’ throughout my life.  I have been off & on Prozac for the past 20 years.  For nearly two years, I have had trouble with sleeping too much (anywhere from 12 to 20 hours a night).  When I saw my regular doctor, she suggested increasing my Prozac to 40mg & said I should expect to stay on it for the rest of my life (I am 63).  With no improvement she added Effexor (75mg).  It didn’t seem to improve the sleeping or depression.  Besides the excessive sleeping, I also felt like crying all the time; found no joy in life; had no energy; & no motivation to do anything (other than what was absolutely necessary ).  I went to a psychiatrist  and he decreased the Effexor  (37.5mg).  With still no improvement, he stopped the Effexor and started me on Wellbutrin (300mg).  Within about three weeks I felt like a “normal” person.  I would wake before the alarm would ring, had more energy and felt not so hopeless. I hadn’t felt like this in a long time.  The change lasted about two months.   After he wrote the next prescription for Budeprion XL (300mg), which he said was cheaper.  I started to feel like I was going back to my old pattern of sleeping too much (not as bad as before but still too much) and not as much energy as with Wellbutrin..  I am sad to say I did not experience any weight loss with either the Wellbutrin or the generic.  While taking the generic, I had some adverse effects which include: dry mouth; tremors of the hands; increase in resting heart rate (85+ per minute); trouble keeping my balance and some hair loss.  When I see the psychiatrist in a month, I plan on having write a prescription for Wellbutrin, not the generic.  It is worth the extra money.

It has really helped me out in so many ways.  I have Muscular Dystrophty (FSH type).  Have been markidly depressed for about 6 years.  Nothing has worked, until I actually asked.. to try Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin has changed my life.  It has definatly increased quality of life, over quanity of life.  Makes dealing with my everyday disease more at ease, with my physical weakness, and mental tiredness.  And what I like about it is, is that it doesn't make you feel ""high"" or ""euphoria"", well, to me anyways, but you just... feel good.  And that is quality of life to me."

It was the first drug I tried and it was a wonder drug for me.I have been on it for 15 years or so. At times, I did struggle and still struggle with suicidal thoughts but that has gotten better as I have gotten older. I did have one period of time where it seemed that the Wellbutrin was loosing its effectiveness. I was weaned off of it and I tried several other antidepressants but none worked as well. I ended up going back on the Wellbutrin and for a short time, was given another medication with it. I am now taking only Wellbutrin and it is once again working well for me most of the time.

Within a day I had nausea, felt like throwing up, headaches, insomnia, and confusion.  Five days after starting, I woke up 5:30 am with such a severe headache I could hardly move, which was followed by severe nausea- my husband got a waste basket for me just in case because I could not move.  I had really bad chest pains added to this, and I counted the minutes till my doctors office opened at 8:00 am.  I had read that some people had more severe side effects with the generic version.  The active ingredient is the same amount in both, but the other components are different, causing some people to react differently.  I wanted to be prescribed Wellbutrin, not the generic, and within a day, most of the symptoms had gone.  What a relief.  It has been mostly a good change- I feel more calm, less anxious, and able to concentrate more, I feel almost ""normal"", but I still have some agitation and sometimes cry at small things, but do not feel depressed, if that makes any sense.  It usually only lasts a few minutes.  I think it would be beneficial to add another medication to this to maximize my results."

I was on it a little over 2 yrs ago to take the edge off. Love it. Lost about 10 lbs and felt great. Did make my thoughts less clear, and got off of it when I had to make some life-changing decisions. Got back on it now, and it is hard to adjust to in the beginning. Mood swings for sure. And I agained 4 lbs in a week! The opposite of what I wanted to happen. Hopefully it will change and go the other way. No sexual side effects except that it is better!  I do have a range of emotions every day though from being confident and secure to being totally insecure and emotional. This too, I hope will pass soon.

I feel lucky to have gotten it right on the first try. Before I began taking Wellbutrin XL I was very depressed, specifically I felt like everybody hated me and conspired against me. After taking it I feel normal again. I know it works becuase if I miss a few pills the same feelings come back until I start taking the pills regularly again. They seem to have a few day delay. Also, my pharmacy gave me the generic version one time so I thought what the heck and decided it wasn't a big deal, but I was wrong. It made my feel like I wasn't taking anything at all and the old feelings were back. After that I made sure my pharmacy always gave me the name brand. This drug really works for me.

There is a difference in absorption rates among the generics and I felt like I was getting it all at once-  Zoned out, headache, down right rotton and tired.  I read an article about some having the same problem so tomorrow I'm back to wellbutrin.  Also it's common to need another medication with this to combat what I call compulsive hyper nastiness.  Everyone is different to what brand/dosage/combination works for them and requires alot of patience.  If you don't feel your dr is listening to you when you're not feeling well, move on to another dr. Just like meds, some drs are better than others.  :)

Regardless, at the times I would go off of Wellbutrin, I would get into addictive habits like excess drinking and other unsavory vices.

I was prescribed 150mg, but after 5 days I had to get off.  I started to get increasingly shaky and I got a bad sore throat and dry mouth.  I didn't sleep for like 2 days, and I started to act kind of weird - like I blew everything out of proportion.  I also started to get nauseous and have headaches.  Anyway, the evening of the 5th day of being on Wellbutrin, I ended up having my first ever panic attack...the night before a final.  It was horrible - it was one of the worst nights of my life.  Thankfully I was able to get a hold of my psychiatrist who was able to get my final rescheduled - I know for a fact I would not have been in any shape to take it the next day.   

Anyway, I'm disappointed Wellbutrin didn't work for me.  I realize that it helps a lot of people, but if you start to get these types of anxiety/mood symptoms, go off before it gets any worse - because it will, and it's not fun.  "

I felt so much better on it but as of now, I am 40 lbs heavier. I have maintained the same weight for like past couple years prior to taking Zoloft and now I cannot stop gaining. It averages about 10 lbs a year and changes in diet and increases in exercise did nothing for me. I got frustrated and depressed about myself so I called my PCP and told him I wanted to try wellbutrin xl, because I heard its does the same thing and often causes people to lose weight rather than gain. I have been taking the generic Buproprion SR now for a little over a month and I am completely miserable. Apparently, people who have anxiety are not supposed to take this drug because it only treats depression and a side effect of it is an increase in anxiety. I have been experiencing loss of appetite but that come with nausea and queasiness-- I feel like I am pregnant (and I am not!). My head feels like its out of whack and I cant really describe the way that it messes with my vision and hearing without sounding like a whack job. My doctor should have known that this drug, with is an SNRI will not help me the way an SSRI does because of my anxiety. This past weekend I graduated college-- an important part of my life-- and I felt incredibly hostile and would go from screaming at my friends and family to bawling my eyes out in 2.5 secs. Thanks, doc. I am glad that I have google and WebMD to tell me what I should/should not take, because he apparently cannot.

The only good thing so far is that I am not smoking as much, only about 2 or 3 cigarettes a day from smoking about a pack a day. Guess I will be going back to the doctor very soon for something else. I wish there was an easier way of finding a medication that worked. I feel like a lab rat going through all these different medicines!

Hopefully my PCP can figure out something else.  These reviews really help.  Thanks everyone!
2556$Depression$5/2/2009 7:06:38 AM$Reviewer: concerned patient from Birmingham, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$3$4$I have been on Wellbutrin XL for almost 5 years and in the last 3 years I have had to switch to the Bupropion XL. The wellbutrin itself worked great, I had loads of energy and did not experience any of the side effects. However, since I've switched to the buprpion,(due to insurance prefering everyone use Generic),I have tried 3 other antidepressants to try to help with the side effects. My mood has changed dramatically for the worse, no energy, headaches or migraines at least 3 times a week, have not even wanted to quit smoking, and now I am at the point of just staying alone, not want to join in family functions or talk to my closest friends. I highly recommend that anyone taking Bupropion XL talk to their physician about writing a letter of referal for the name brand Wellbutrin XL to the insurance company because the Generic is not the same and does not have the equality as the Wellbutrin.

2560$Depression$4/25/2009 12:09:49 PM$Reviewer: Bamagirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been on Wellbutrin for about 10 months.  In December I began taking the 300mg XL version.  It helped me tremendously.  I had so much energy and motivation to do things.  It was a generic.  In March I had to switch my pharmacy so they gave me a different generic.  It was made by Watson.  I started getting really tired all the time.  I was constantly angry with people for no good reason and also seemed to be obbsessive compulsive.  There were also many physical side effects also.  I finally realized it was the medicine and stopped it immediately.  I began feeling so much better within 24 hours.  I can't believe the difference in these generics.  Please pay close attention to how you begin feeling when you take these.  I seriously think I would have become suicidal if I had not quit and I have never felt that way before.  If it's not working for you go to your doctor and try something else because these medicines can really change your entire personality.

2564$Depression$4/21/2009 11:20:32 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$3$Wellbutrin alone didn't do anything for me, but together with Lexapro, I felt like a new and happy person. The only side effect that I didn't like was the low sex drive (since I am married, my husband wasn't happy about that!) But he admitted I seemed genuinely upbeat and energetic. I even decorated the house for Christmas which was incredible for me since my depression worsens around the holidays. Having tried many different meds, I think this combo works the best.
2566$Depression$4/21/2009 10:41:13 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$4$I have tried several different meds for anxiety/depression/OCD, each one giving me the exact side effects it has listed.  Maybe I'm just sensitive I guess.  With this one the worst was probably the constipation and blurred vision with bouts of dizzy spells where I felt off balance all of a sudden.  It seemed to work well with keeping my anxiety attacks under control and supressing some OCD tendencies but again I can't handle the side effects.  I am hoping something will work as well without the extras I don't need.  We'll see I guess...

However, I experienced a paradoxical reaction to the medicine about 48 hours after first use.  Interestingly, the first time I used it, I felt better.  Not the next... I felt like I wanted to die.  I have had depression most of my life, and this beat everything I have ever felt (this was a -1 dose- effect, btw).  I quit taking it immediately and tossed it in the trash.  I had an appointment with my psychiatrist the next day, and told him all about it.  Normally, a doctor would say not to miss a dose (which I did by not taking it the next morning) without asking, but mine said he was glad I got off it.  Desipramine works better for me.

Not suggesting that this is a poor drug; I'm sure it's great for many people.  However, believe it when they say it can have side effects or make you feel worse..."

This is not about Wellbutrin, but the generic, Budeprion SR 150 mg x2. Irritability, jitters, at first, with 2nd dose at noon--super-witch, anger replaying itself.  I checked reviews of generic first, before reading here.  Many of the same comments were made.  At first, it seemed to work w/Lexapro.  Then after weening from Lexapro I  felt so brain racing and fatigue from the event.  Thought it was the Lexapro withdrawal.  Paid attention to my reactions after a.m. dose only and then with noon dose.  There appears to be a cumulative negative effect, producing more irrational impatience.  I'm scared; will discuss w/psych after having read generic reviews and Wellbutrin reviews.  I  do not normally have bad reactions to any kinds of medication.  NB: the generic medication seemed to work w/ Lexapro for a year. I've been on the genric Budeprion SR for two months. I'll ask to switch to the Wellbutrin and write back.  I've been retired about a year--I should be relaxed.

In that time I went from being my easy going sweet self to a witch on wheels. It was bad enough for my whole family to sit me down. I was later diagonsed with bi-polar due to extremely stressful conditions. I'm not sure if this medication exaserbated that problem since at the time it had gone undiagnosed. I would recommend before starting anything for depression you make sure that's all you're dealing with.

2580$Depression$4/7/2009 11:02:49 AM$Reviewer: lazybonz,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on wellbutrin for 15 years-I came off of it for a short time but the anxiety caused me to return to it again. Like most depression sufferers I have tried many drugs over the years but this one has the least side effects and works great. I occasionally get dry mouth so you do need to stay hydrated.  I was a smoker and a drinker and have kicked both habits as the drug really does reduce cravings for any pleasure. Unfortunately that does include sex as well-it does decrease your libido but that can be overcome if you work at it! It does not decrease the pleasure level but the desire to get started just isn't there. I did have a period of time where I was not eating as it does also take away your cravings for food. My hubby loves to eat so he makes me eat too,so I have not had anorexia since I met him but I did with my first husband. So I would say that an understanding mate goes a long way toward helping to make this drug a success. I take 150 sr upon waking and before bed. My insurer is also pushing the generic but that did not work for me. I understand there are some generics that are better than others and if the cost is a factor you could try those first. I am convinced that wellbutin treats alcoholism because it runs in my family and I was a problem drinker until I took wellbutrin. I can have a drink now and not want another-but that may just be me. It is sure worth a try if you drink too much-I don't know why it is not more widely used for treating alcoholism because it works. You do have to take wellbutrin for 60 to 90 days to get the full effect of the drug.During that time you do have dry mouth but that subsides after a while and was not a significant problem for me. I am 62 years old so I don't know how much longer I will take it but the doctors seem to think that it is a lifelong drug. It has made a drastic change in my life and I recomend it highly!!

I have tried it all.  Paxil made me sleepy and sweat but relieved anxiety, Prozac gave me tons of energy but made me 'crazy' and moody, Cymbalata made my anxiety go thru the roof, Celexa didn't do anything. I was on Zoloft for years, it was great for the anxiety but not the depression.  I slept a lot and just had no ambition to do anything more than I had to. I am now on the generic of this - 150 the first week and I am in day 2 of 300mg.  I LOVE IT SO FAR!!  My energy is through the roof, my fog of depression has lifted and I feel great.  My only side affect so far is that I seem to have an aching back, that could be due to the anxiety level needing to balance out.  However, I will take a slightly aching back over no energy and sleeping all of the time!
One thing I have learned is that everyone reacts differently to each med. so you just have to find the one that works for you."

I can cope .  I tried stopping several times, became immediately in major depression.  I started with low dose,gradually over the years increased to 300mg.  I have tried every version and every generic and brand name, each one is a little different because of absorption rate is differs from brand to brand.  All are effective, but I do notice differences if affect and side-effects.  Some are absorbed more slowly so work best when take b4 bedtime to not interfere with sleep, but others donot.  Also different people will experience different absorption rates between brands and dosages.  So you all hang in their, talk to your Dr.
2588$Depression$3/29/2009 7:48:49 PM$Reviewer: joyousq, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$Was prescribed the generic Bupropion HCL for mild depression and anxiety.  The first few days on 150 mg were a little scary.  I had a headache the entire time.  This only lasted about 3 days.  On the fifth day started 300 mg.  Loved the energy boost and eveniness of my mood. I also immediately quit smoking...have tried quitting many times before with no success. I started getting bad cramps and realized I was horribly constipated.  Tried upping my fiber and fluid intakes but nothing helped.  I had to stop taking it because of this...BUMMER.  I really liked this med and wish I could continue but I can't take laxative everyday to conteract the constipation!!!!!!!  Some decrease in sexual desire did occur.  My doc prescribed me Effexor XR and I filled the ordered but I do not think I will try this one because of the horrible things I have been reading about it.  I will be asking her about Cymbalta because the reviews seem much more positive.  I wish the makers of Wellbutrin/Bupripion could fix the constipation issue because it worked great for me!

My insurance plan is now forcing me to use bupropion and/or budeprion. Both make want to jump from a bridge. I use generics for other issues with no complaints.

I wasn't given the XL to start off with and for some reason...just couldn't remember to take 1 pill 3 times a day.  I am a SUPER busy mom and full time college student (aren't we all super busy though?).  Anywho, After 2 weeks I went to the doc to let him know about my difficulty and THEN he gave me the XL...it is SO much easier taking 1 pill in the morning and being done with it.  So far, things seem to be improving.  I am on the 300.  It has ALSO cut back my craving to smoke (AWESOME..since taxes went through the roof..again).  My depression seems to be getting a little better but I haven't experienced any weight loss that I was REALLY looking forward to.  LOL!  
I am giving the XL a month to ""kick in"" and hopefully by then my depression will have subsided or at least decreased more.  Oh...ALSO...I AM tired ALL THE TIME!  But if the medication helps me smile again and feel ""normal"" then perhaps less sleep and an occasional redbull will make it all worth while  :o)
Good luck to everyone who is taking this...I not only hope it works for me...but for all of you as well!!!

I just stopped taking it within the last month or so. I now feel much better. I believe that Welbutrin may have contributed to my anxiety and moods. I felt very anxious and was extemely moody. I feel so much better now being off of it for a month. The positive of this med is, no sexual side effects and weight loss.

My hair began falling out about six months ago and I think it started when I switched to generic budeprion xl and increased my dosage.  Luckily I have thick hair, but I have lost about 50% of my hair and my doctor insists it is not a side effect of the medication.  Does anyone know when or if my hair will stop falling out? I am starting to freak out, the Wellbutrin has been great for treating my Depression, but losing my hair at age 31 is stressing me out.

I stopped taking it recently and feel so much better! I was so sleepy before and wasn't able to concentrate, which was my big concern. I'm still on Lexapro and feel that medication, along with focusing less on me and more on the Lord, are all I need to start living again.

2640$Depression$2/24/2009 8:24:38 PM$Reviewer: ABMN, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$In Dec 2007 I was prescribed Wellbutrin 150mg, after the initial few weeks it just didn't seem to be working. My doctor bumped me up the the XL. It started working almost immediately. It felt as if the veil and earmuffs had been removed and colors and sounds became real again. I was extremely happy with the 50 lbs I lost. Sex drive came back with a vengeance. No listed side effects. It is now Feb 2009 and it doesn't seem to be working anymore; back to being irritable, short tempered and just sad. Going to Dr in 2 days to see if something else will work. One side effect that I can't find anyone else having is it messed with my period, even on birth control. My period would come whenever it wanted regardless of what week of pills I was on. Once I switched to taking the BCP at night and Wellbutrin XL in the a.m. it seemed to get MUCH better. Now that the wellbutrin isn't working as great, my cycle is completely whacked. Usually one week w/o it, then get it for a few days, then another week w/o, etc. Doctors say it has nothing to do with each other but I have been on the same BCP for almost 6 years and it didn't happen until I started taking the Wellbutrin XL.

I combine Wellbutrin XL 150mg with Adderall XR 15mg during the week, and take just the Wellbutrin on weekends (when I don't work).  I have had few negative side effects-- the two noticeable are the dry mouth (the dryness affects intercourse as well) and hair loss, which I experienced when I was on the 300 mg dose.  I backed down to the 150mg and the hair loss has stopped.  I am grateful I was prescribed this drug first-- it really does work quite well.

2652$Depression$2/12/2009 8:51:04 PM$Reviewer: smytti36, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$3$"     -Generic Brand vs. Name Brand Wellbutrin XL-
I've been on Wellbutrin for (about) a year and MUST comment on the effects of the generic brand, Bupropion (Sp?). 
   Because I don't have insurance, I spent a while on the generic version and failed to progress out of my depressive state. For a few weeks I felt like I was mildly feeling a change, but eventually it felt like I had plateaued, and shortly after, I returned to spiraling downward. 
   There were other medications added and subtracted to Wellbutrin in order to determine the right combination of drugs to aid my depression/anxiety/ADD. I AM POSITIVE that my only improvement was the result of other medications (Lamictal- mood stabilizer). 
   It has been documented that the generic version of this drug does NOT produce the same progressive results as the name brand. I can confidently say, that my experience w/ Bupropion was not a good one, in fact, I'd say it was horrible, and at times, worse than my initial state.
   I have been back to taking the name brand Wellbutrin XL for about 3-4 months. I have continued to feel a drastic improvement in my mental state, and finally recognize the person that I knew I always was. It has enabled me to live my life again.   
   Although I have felt such a great improvement, the cost is $167 (that's with insurance), which is the CO-PAY! Without the insurance, the cost is $230-$270, and very few insurance companies offer reasonable coverage for Wellbutrin XL, since the generic version was approved."

It definetly helped me overcome my depression for a while. However the drug did give me seizures. I'd take 5 or 6 Wellbutrins a day (as opposed to one)to get high and lose wieght. This gave me grand mal seizures. I stopped the drug and resumed my pill regimen months later, vowing to take only one pill a day. I did, but still had seizures. The seizures weren't a result of overdosing on the wellbutrin. They happened because I was taking them while abusing street drugs (Ecstasy and Cocaine). Please, tell you doctor if you have a drug problem or are prone to overdosing on OTC/prescription pills for fun. I crashed my car into a tree during one of the seizures I had. (PS Do not take if you have an eating disorder. Weight loss is common in users)
2656$Depression$2/10/2009 6:16:50 PM$Reviewer: me27513, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$Why do docs use only one drug at a time? After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, I don't build up a tolerance (even after 10 years), and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

It took about 3 months for it to fully work. For 8 months I felt absolutely wonderful. I had energy & drive to exercise, I smiled & laughed again. Did not help my anxiety but I still take Lorazepam for that. In the last 3 weeks (about a year since I started it) I've become very depressed, irritated at stupid things, angry. This morning my doctor said sometimes it just doesn't work anymore. She prescribed Cymbalta so I'm going to wean off of Wellbutrin while weaning onto Cymbalta over the next 6 weeks.  I do know people who got WORSE using Wellbutrin, I know some who love it after years of use. I was right in the middle. I loved it but it just stopped working. 

Also I lost the 25 lbs that I had gained on Lexapro once the Wellbutrin worked. "

It really helps visualize what is wrong and what needs to be worked on. If you start missing doses, you will fall pretty hard so be careful about that. That is the set back about some drugs, though take them as prescribed. If not regularly, tell doctor and why that is. For me, it has better results with Abilify.

Wellbutrin has been a life saver for me. It works very well for me combined with Effexor XR.  Took a long time to find a combination that worked. I have more control over my emotions, irritability,anger and suicidal thoughts. I feel so ""normal"" sometimes I forget my meds. Isn't long before (24-48 hours) before I notice a difference and get back in control. 
Unfortunately, my medical insurance changed this year and instead of a $35.00 co-pay, it is now $215.00 co-pay for the Wellbutrin. I am guessing it is to force folks to get the generic. I refuse, I know I will not do as well on the generic.I am scared,I do not want to go through the misery of finding a substitute. What if I can't find something that works as well for me?

All previous medications were either ineffective, or caused intolerable side effects. Wellbutrin, for me, is a miracle drug, allowing me to function like a normal person. At one time I was unable to afford it, and had to wean myself off of it. By three months without it, I was in a full blown depressed state, wanting to sleep all the time, crying, and thinking irrationally. Now back on Wellbutrin XL I can once again enjoy my life, and I feel human again.

It also curbs my appetite. At first it made it difficult to get to sleep, but .50 mg of Trazadone is enough to help me get to sleep, and makes it easy to get 7-8 hours of sleep.

One of my doctors think it may aggravate my irritability.  Exactly what I don't need.  This is a med to skip. Its worthless to quit smoking, and useless for depression, in my experience. No side effects besides possibly contributing to my irritability, but no proof that the wellbutrin has anything to do with it.  I wouldn't bother trying this drug.

I use this medication in combination with Zoloft. For many years, I had been taking a very small dosage with an ""ok"" effect. I switched psychiatrists and we increased the dosage. Since then, I have had very wonderful success with using Wellbutrin. I would definitely recommend this medication, but you have to be the one to decide if it is working for you or not. Be proactive in your treatment! After all, it is your life!!"

I could no longer afford the medications when i left the military so i decided to stop them cold turkey and did not have any side effects like i did when trying to be weaned off just the zoloft. I think this is a great medication and can help when taken with other medications when you dont want to up the doses anymore, this can give you a different mix to help. It's worth a shot
2711$Depression$12/23/2008 5:18:12 PM$Reviewer: BobbyPeru, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$Prior to this medication (I take the generic, Bupropion XL), I had tried a couple of different medications. None of them worked well.  Then, my doctor prescribed this. After about three weeks, I noticed that I would wake up without the customary depression that had been afflicting me for over a year and a half. Mind you, the depression has not gone away, but it has lessened greatly. The medication also sped up my metabolism and I lost weight. Nice. I also have more energy and my mind is not as lethargic as before. I take the medication with Lamictyl for anxiety and mood swings. Bupropion's side effects are occasional hyperactivity,  occasional stomachaches and frequent visits to the number for number 2, which may be caused by my sped up metabolism. Furthermore, my libido has increased and my performance in that department has improved. I am fortunate to be taking these medication and hope the benefits to not subside with time. Again, I emphasize that the depression has not ceased completely, but it has lessened in frequency and intensity.

Torture is the best way to discribe it. I tried Effexor, Lexapro & Prozac. I experienced absolutly no relief from any of these.  Then I tried Wellbutrin.  I thank God for the relief I felt within the first week.  I am taking 150 mg once a day & feel that this is a little on the low side as far as dosage.  I have no side effects.  I would recomend this medication but not in generic form.  The generic affected me in a bad way with many side effects.  If your depression is brought on by Chantix try Wellbutrin.

I also took lunesta to handle a sleep disorder (waking up like clockwork 3 hours into my sleep). I needed something to schock my out of my usual habits of depressiveness, and it did shock me, but made me different, but not much better. Made me much more volatile, although happier in general. When I would have a low, although less often, they would feel like life or death lows. And my tension increased. But it did change things, atleast, just not for much better. But different, but still bad, is better than same and still bad.

It was easy to use. Only thing is trying to take it regularly and trying not to get drunk while taking it.

I'm pretty neutral about satisfaction. I believe it may work for some, but it increased my volatility, although it did do *something*, atleast.

I have a tendency to be anxious and I don't really think it does too much to help with that.  The only side effect is that I feel a bit jittery but feel more alert.  Also, it has definitely cut my appetite which has helped get rid of a little extra weight that I put on over the past year (which I think was due to Zoloft and depression).

Actually it made the anxiety problem twice as bad. Overall it was ok for the depression but I could not maintain an erection for nothing while I was taking this product. Which is due to the anxiety issue caused by this product. One minute I was semi hard and as soon as I would think about my problem, it would just shibble up. Or even if I heard a sound like the wind blow, the party was over. I have stopped taking this product for only a week now and Ole Willie is standing proud again.
The only problem is now I can see a slight depression behavior problem returning and I do not know what to do. I do not want to have issues but if I can't enjoy having a sex life, it's depressing too!"

I started at 75mg 2x/day, and am currently at 100mg 2x/day.  My depression symptoms have subsided and I am more comfortable around people with less irritability.  However, I continue to have anxiety and constant worry (Generalized Anxiety Disorder).  It appears that Wellbutrin does not list this as one of the treatable conditions.  I am considering switching to Prozac instead.  One major plus about Wellbutrin is that it has had no sexual side effects on me, unlike other antidepressants I've tried before such as Paxil and Lexapro.  Also, I haven't had any weight gain from taking Wellbutrin; however, my appetite has increased (I get hungry quicker).  If depression is the only condition to be treated, then I would recommend Wellbutrin.

I've been taking generic Wellbutrin 75mg for less than a week now, and so far it seems to be helping. I'm sometimes groggy in the morning, but it goes away and I feel awake and clear-headed all day. One unusual thing: by evening I sometimes feel anxious, and two nights ago I had a full-blown panic attack and could not stop crying and feeling scared. I had a very stressful day at work though so maybe I can attribute the panic to that. I also notice changes in my appetite, like I will be hungry but not want food, or feel full after three bites of something. My energy level seems better, and I don't feel a lack of sexual desire like I did before the drug. The flat, gray feeling seems to be lessening. Overall, I do feel better, like a fog has been lifted off of me.In two weeks I'll switch to the brand-name version at 150mg, so hopefully things keep improving. Hope this helps!

Honestly, it was like putting on a pair of glasses for the first time after not realizing you'd been looking a blurry world.  It did make it easier to get up in the morning, it didn't affect my weight, it didn't affect my sex drive or the quality of sex, AND it really improved my daily depression.

I am still irritable, and that's something I wish would get better, but I'm glad not to be so miserable and ""blah"" everyday... I figure, at least I'm not an emotional wreck and I can at least tolerate some of the things that were making me feel terrible before.  Also, I have definitely experienced decrease in appetite... I don't eat much during the day, but sometimes at night I'll wake up and find myself going to the fridge to make myself a sandwich because I'm so hungry from not eating all day!  Also, I find it more difficult to fall asleep, and normally I go to bed pretty early and have no issues, so it's weird for me.  Other than the appetite and insomnia this med seems ok.

Ever since taking this drug...300 mg/day, I feel much better but I get irritated easily now, but at least I am not crying everyday.Also I am not as spaced out before taking these pills. Just do not take it after 2-3:00 pm because you will be up all night, unless you have a test to study for its great...(I am also a student).Being depressed made me see things in a different light... which makes me feel better about me getting better.

IF this is the case why would anyone want to put this drug in their body which might effect their brain function as well as Kidneys and Liver..

Curious what the top 20 Drugs the FDA recalled and never listed in the newspapers.

All drugs if labeled may cause dizzyness, don't operate heavy machinery etc should not even take the drug.. Try holistic methods such as Tai Chi , Meditation, Omega-3 capsules vegetarian ones..

I have been on Elavil for many years and it has helped. After the death of a person very important in my life, I became very depressed even on the Elavil. My Dr. put me on Wellbutrin along with the Elavil.  I can not believe the change in my life.  My personality has changed and I am able to deal with every day things so much better than any time in my life. I have, or had, a very nasty temper and I am very sick over the times I lost my temper and caused much hurt to others. I did things, in this uncontrolable temper, that I will never forgive my self for. I have been able to deal with getting mad and upset like a real person. I was so afraid that when I did have a situation I would lose it again. That has not happened at ALL on this.  It is hard to understand unless you have this kind of personialty. I can never thank enough who ever developed this medication.  I do not have the right words to express this. Thank you

However, I feel like a zombie. My mind is mostly blank. I either feel bad or nothing. I am irritable, my family tells me I am constantly crabby.

So far it has helped me a lot. I have been Effexor XR for 10 months and even with dosage increases my depression kept coming back. Rather than increase the Effexor my doctor decided to add the Wellbutrin. I also saw a Clinical nurse on the recomendation of my therapist. She said she wasn't that familiar with this combination but if it was working she said not to change. She said she would have probably increased the Effexor to a higher level. She said most doctors get nervous with that and usually add another medication. Right now I am feeling better and will only call my therapist or clinical nurse if the depression comes back.

Folks argumentative in the family but better than withdrawn and depressive. Just watch the personality changes and weigh if you can tolerate those effects as above.

It effects dopamine and nuropenephrin (sp?), but doesn't really effect serotonin.  I tried taking Wellbutrin XL by itself and Lexapro by itself...with the former, i had similar anxiety issues that others have mentioned, and I didn't feel that Lexapro did too much for me...plus it made it really hard to orgasm.  i've been on 300 xl and 10 mg for about 2 years now, and it's been a great combo for me.

I just went off Effexor.  The Dr. put me on Wellbutin XL 150 MG.  So far, I do not think it is working.  Usually when I change meds, it is an easy transition.  I have been taking it for only a week, but I am more angry.  I have been lashing out at my 8 and 4 year old.  Extreme anger.  I also have had diarrea. I also will think that I see things out of the corner of my eyes that aren't there.  I now can cry at the drop of a hat.  I do take a generic form of Wellbutrin.  I have been sleeping great!  Other pills that I have taken usually keep you awake a night.  Who knows maybe I have not taken it long enough.  I called my Dr today and he wants me to wait another week.  He feels it is not in my system yet.  So far, nothing has changed except for the anger.   We will wait and see!

Wellbutrin, I thought was a lifesaver until I begin to slow down and do ""normal"" things in my life. While being an athlete, I did not have the time to sit down and notice the impact of this medication; however, once becoming a mother, I noticed the zombie in me. I literally felt like a zombie once re-prescribed this medication (I did not take the medication while pregnant). Times where it was perfectly normal for me to cry (like a funeral) I would not cry at all. I was desensitized to the world around me to include my newborn. I immediately took myself off the medication without the guidance of the doctor (bad idea - but at the time it worked for me). I did not have any withdrawal issues, which is a good thing! Nevertheless, I begin to try other medications in hopes of addressing my depression. But, I did not want to go through life feeling numb. In the end, I have turned to herbal treatment which is working wonders for me. I will NOT go back to this medication. I promised myself and those who love me. "

I actaully could get out of bed & felt normal for once, got my energy back & alot more patience with my kids (both hyper),I also lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks (that was great cause I'm 40 pounds overweight from the depression) The only problems is that the side effects started when my MD double the dose week 2. Three days after starting to take 300mg, I broke out in hives just on my face. I couldn't leave the house until they went away! I also feel a little absent minded, spelling words wrong and forgeting what I was doing. I didn't have these problems with the 150mg. Off meds for awhile until rash clears up and then going back to 150 and see what happens.

It has made it easier for me to get out of bed and has stopped me from crying for no reason.  There seem to be two types of generic pills; I found one didn't help me at all, but the other one (purple colored) was as effective as the brand name version.  I experience shaking hands and constipation from the medication.  It doesn't cause the low sex drive and weight gain that I've experienced with other medications.  
2857$Depression$7/30/2008 4:38:57 PM$Reviewer: $5$5$5$Wellbutrin was like a miracle drug for me.  I never took anything that actually made a difference.  I took 450mg/day.

However I had side effects that were somewhat annoying and made me stop the drug. Most noteable to me was a slight tremor in my hands, making handwriting look worse.

I switched to the generic, but i have lost my sex drive and vomit randomly and sweat alot(not often, but it is annoying when you are out and start sweating and get sick). seems like name-brand wellbutrin is the way to go. I lost more than 20 pounds taking this. Chronic depression runs in the family so my mom switched antidepressants to this drug and she likes it too. try it it might be worth it for you
2864$Depression$7/13/2008 2:24:38 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$1$I rated the effectiveness of this drug 5 stars because in conjunction with 30mg of Lexapro, it helped relieve the depression. I think it is important to note however that this drug caused me to noticeably shake my hands all day. I am a phlebotomist and this had a negative affect on my job. Also, while it takes away the depression, it causes your mind to not really care about anything. Sure, your not depressed, but you become emotionless. Maybe my side effects were due to the combination but I just want to stress the fact that you need to be very careful before just taking what is prescribed to you by the physician. I believe I had TOO much drug therapy.
2865$Depression$7/12/2008 11:02:42 AM$Reviewer: Dee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$2$My depression was triggered by my brothers suicide & moms cancer diagnosis(both within 2007.) I have been trying to find somthing to just get me through this time so I can be sane for my family- not to pretend it is not there. I am on my second month on Welbutrin. It took at least a month to kick in. I was irritated easily for the first few weeks, but that went away a few weeks ago. I have lost just a few pounds and I do not feel like a flat line like I did on Lexapro. My sex drive is also still intact, thank God! The only downfall is that every night I get nausea, wich is why for me, it is not easy to use. My doc says to wait it out a few more weeks and make sure to take it every MORNING (I work nights so I took it later) I tried to have two drinks one night, and almost vomitted. I also got airsick for the first time. But I laugh again, and I am ready to be there for my mom now, who will be undergoing a stem-cell transplant soon. The stress is not gone- but I can at least handle it better now.My husband and mom both need me too much for me to wallow in misery all the time. If only I could get rid of the damn nausea! Oh yea, my husband said he noticed my memory has been better. I used to think depression was somthing you could talk yourself out of. Somtimes you have nothing left to give, and that is when it is time to see a doc or counseling to search what is right for you. I hope this helped someone because alot of the others helped me. Good luck!

I take it for depression/anxiety and it made me feel flat, better then being on nothing but nothing I wanted to stay on.  I stuck it out for a year and just went off it a month ago.  I tried Prozac which worked great with the exception of sexual side affects.  Wellbutrin made me sweat a lot, had trouble sleeping, still had these weird mood swings and lack of energy.  So I am trying Cymbalta.  I guess I will have to wait and see.  I wouldn't take Wellbutrin again, it really wasn't worth it.  Wish the Prozac didn't cause the sexual side affects because that worked great for me.

I realized I needed to be treated for depression when I was in my early 30's. I finally went to a doctor and asked for help. After trying some different medications and dosages we finally decided on Wellbutrin XL 450mg with Effexor XR 225mg. I've been on this for about 2 years. IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID! My anxiety and anger was gone after a few weeks. I stopped fighting with my husband and co-workers everyday. I was able to take difficult situations in stride. The worst side effect was dry mouth. I will say that after reading some of these reviews I'm terrified to ever go off of the Effexor XR.

Taking 150-dosage, there was no effect either way--which means it sucked BIG TIME.  I want to be ""comfortably numb,"" but lousy Wellbutrin XL does nothing to assuage my abject disgust with my children (& at times with my wife, who hardly ever interacts with the buggers).

The only thing about Zoloft was, not only did it take away the anxiety...it took away all my emotions!! I was numb. Was not sad, was not happy, just didn't feel anything. A friend of mine's infant died recently, and I was sad for her in my head. I wanted to cry, but couldn't.  It also takes away the libido. Yeah...that sucks. So my doc switched me to Wellbutrin 100mg, and at first, just like a post I read earlier. I felt drugged, tired and wierd. I kept taking it though. It's been about a month, and I love it. It's false happiness in a pill, but I guess that is better than none at all right? I love it !!! I am not as anti-social as I had become.

Could the anxiety come from Wellbutrin or taking less Effexor? Have been on Effexor for only 5 weeks, tolerated it well. Before then I was on Lexapro.

Doesnt seem to be working. Havent had any side effects other than if I drink coffee I get terrible nerves and jitters. I still feel pretty unmotivated, tired (even when having enough sleep) and sad most of the time. Doing things takes a huge amount of effort, and if I didnt ""have to"" I just wouldnt. I also have terrible PMS and this definately has not helped that AT ALL. I have terrible mood swings and I become completely irrational and angry at everything for several days per month. I just want to feel like myself again and I think this might not be the right drug for me, although it may work for others. "

2928$Depression$3/31/2008 7:48:49 PM$Reviewer:  (Patient) $4$1$4$The first time I took this drug I took it for almost a year and had no problems with it, other than some diahrrea. I recently resumed taking it again after being off of it for almost 6 months due to problems with my insurance. For the past two days I have suffered with horrible anxiety attacks, I had to go to the emergency room yesterday. I have never had anxiety attacks or anxiety problems before. I think I would rather be depressed than experience anything like that ever again. I felt like I was on acid or losing my mind or something. In addition to the new anxiety, it has also caused me to be continuously either constipated or have diahrrea, nothing in between. It also gave me insomnia, which by itself is  manageable but coupled with anxiety it can drive a person insane. I will not take this drug again, even if it means crying out my depressions and talking myself out of suicide. Be careful and be prepared.

I started falling into depression after my first pregnancy, everyone told me it would go away but it didn't.  Than after losing my second pregnancy at 20 weeks (twins), I couldn't handle it.  After being depressed and not recognizing myself for about a year and a half I decided to do something about it.  My doctor put me on 300 mg of the XL.  And I had some of the side effects like not sleeping, dry mouth, lower libedo.  But the whole libedo and sleeping thing now have subsided and with the whole dry mouth I just drink a lot of water.  Which isn't a bad thing.  I love this drug, I have more energy during the day, I am back to my old happy self.  And my husband is happy because I am back to the person he married and not some Psyco women that he never knows what mood she is going to be in or what will set her off next.

Before I was on Paxil it worked really good but a year later I realized I had gained over 20 pounds, I had tried going to the gym busting my but eating right and could not lose the weight. So I went to the dr. and she suggested this. She said it's supposed to help with my anxity,deppression and promote weightloss. Right now my moods are all over the place, but I expected that just hope it goes away. I'll write back in a couple weeks O I have notice already the appetite change, not so much in chage of smoking yet.

For my moderate depression it worked very well but after long term use I just felt ""numb"". It killed my libido and it left me with a feeling of ambivalence. One of the worst side effects for me was headache (other than no sex drive) and dizzyness ranked high as well. All of those things listed above in addition to concerns over interactions with another ""more important"" medication I take helped me make the decision to stop."

My doctor switched me to wellbutrin sr (which didnt work as well for me) but the time i was on wellbutrin xl, it changed my life! Grades improved, I was getting honors (something I had never gotten before) and I was very very driven and motivated to do things. It helped my concentration so much and my desire to accomplish things in my life. I will give this warning: once being on it for long periods of time I felt great and felt like I didnt need meds anymore. I would stop taking it and within a month later would have horrible episodes from being off of it. This happened to me about three times. Once your on it, it is hard to get off but it definately improved my life. I am now on an SSRI and have found that I have no emotion at all and its hard to feel anything. While on wellbutrin, I still could feel emotions,etc. It didnt take every feeling away from me totally. This is a good drug to take, especially for a teenager, that is when I started it. I attribute all my accomplishments to this drug, I realy would not be where i am today without it and I am looking in to going back on it in combination with my SSRI

I've been on it since it was created. If you want further info you can email me b/c it won't all fit here: [email protected] This drug works for depression & smoking cessation-no doubt. However, don't expect to be able to stop taking it, in my case, perhaps ever. 5 x's I've stopped. The 1st 3 were due to no insurance & by the 3rd I was 'rationing' pills and splitting them in half. The 4th was an attempt to ween myself and the 5th was w/a Dr.'s assistance that Rx'd another drug to ease me off. I CANNOT BE WITHOUT THIS DRUG. It's a horrendous 'rubber band effect' I call the ""crash n burn"". It took awhile for me realize that It may be a month or so after it's out of your system to happen, but it will happen, and it will be harsh. I have taken this drug w/little conjunction of other drugs and know that it works to promote an overall sense of well being. BUT there are side effects [for me-everyone is different and thus cannot be expected to have the exact same experience]. For me I do have dry mouth, periodic insomnia, lower sex drive and constipation (the latter 2 were present before, just intensified by the drug). I feel like a Rx junkie, getting low on this drug causes me to panic. I have hoarded it for ins. changes. You win GSK- you now own me. I hope you're happy and proud of yourself. Despite choosing to be happy and not wanting to rely on a chemical to make that be, I no longer can. Perhaps I'm being too harsh on GSK and I truly have a chemical imbalance that will always need to be corrected??? Could be. I just think the warning should be known of how powerful Wellbutrin really is. Is it a miracle drug or the socially acceptable form of crack or smack? I have developed a love/hate relationship with it at this point in my life. I love to take it and fell good and I hate to take it and feel weak for needing it. Straight up depression just blows. Too indescribable to an outsider about how it actually feels. "

2940$Depression$3/5/2008 12:47:36 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$4$Before this medication I was absolutley a mess. I was crying almost everyday, on my days off from work I would lay on the couch and would not get up all day. I had stopped going out with friends, gained over 30 lbs, and overall just didn't care about anything. I decided it was time to take action and as much as I thought, oh this is a phase and I will snap out of it, I realized I couldn't do it on my own anymore. I started out at 150 mg and yes, there were side effects. I couldn't sleep at night, I lost my appettite (which I didn't mind), I was alot more anxious and kind of trembly, and I was sweating alot more and really thirsty. At first I was like, I can't do this, I work 12 hours a day I need sleep and food and, etc. These side effects lasted for about 2 months. For the sleeping issues I started taking this medication right when I woke up in the morning, about 5:30 am. I noticed that this helped me have more energy through the day and wore off toward the evenings but, still I was only sleeping like 4 hours a night. I started taking Xanax and Ambien, not together and not every night, but this helped alot. I have been on this medication for almost a year now, my doctor upped my dose to 300mg, I am soooo much more motivated, happy, and I have found me again.I have lost over 20 lbs and like I said this medicine gives me energy and the motivation to workout now and care about what I look like. The nervous, anxious, trembling feeling has gone away. I still sweat a little moe than usual and am thirsty but, it is not a major thing to me, I have adjusted. I would really recommend this mediaction to anyone who was having the symptoms of depression like I was. And, those symptoms weren't at certain times in the season or just every once in a while, yes they were worse during winter then summer. I was on a roller coaster of emotions up and down and I needed major help. Give this med. a try, ride out the side effects if you can, it is worth it in the end!!!!

I have none of that with Wellbutrin.

I had been severely depressed for over a year, and bad circumstances beyond my control that happened in 2007 made it even worse.  I have to say that after the first month on Wellbutrin (and therapy), however, I am feeling great.  It is also a great energy booster and I feel like I'm accomplishing much more than I had for so long.
BUT...I have a terrible time trying to sleep.  Even with taking a sleeping pill, I average 4-5 hours of sleep a night.  While I don't want to stop taking Wellbutrin, the insomnia is a real problem, and as of yet my doctor and I haven't found a way to overcome it. "

It takes the rough edge off and I am much nicer to be around.  I do have to watch my weight though, seems to have put some pounds on.  That's minor to losing friends, a marriage and even the dog feared me.  Wellbutrin has saved my marriage for sure.

It worked and I don't smoke anymore. Then I realized I like the new me and realized I had undiagnosed depresion. After 2 years of taking it I went to a new OB-GYN for my yearly and she inadvertantly changed me to Wellbutrin XL (it stays in your system twice as long as the SR). I didn't think anything of it as I am a RN and work in a pharmacy where the standard is the XL dose. After 3 1/2 to 4 months I started having blurry vision(I had LASIK 2 1/2 years ago), nausea, diarrhea, dizzyness, then anxiety, jittery, then shaky and rapid heart rate with missed beats. So bad that one day I clocked out and went to the ER. My heart was racing at 120-135 beats per minute. They sent me home on a Holter monitor to record my heart and it came back with frequent sinus tachycardia with occasional premature atrial and ventrical beats. Not realizing the drug switch, I was positive that my thyroid was out of wack. Had all the tests even changed doctors since I didn't think the first doc was doing enough. Finally I asked an eye doctor if Wellbutrin could be causing my vision problems and he told me to get it changed. I start a new medication in the morning, so we will see if it works for me.

Starting on day one, I starting having hallucinations at night and they got worse the next couple nights. I stopped taking it after that. The one thing I had was my sleep and that was important to me. this drug interupted that. Maybe if i could have stuck it out, they would have stopped but I couldn't take it anymore. I was seeing things melt down my wall and seeing people in my room. My husband literally had to lay on top of me and hold me to get me to sleep.

I couldn't sleep at all. I have a 2 mo. old baby who wakes up about every 2 hrs. or so , so by the time I would fall asleep, the baby would be waking up again. Also, I had no memory at all. I felt like I was in a constant fog, like I was too doped up to even think straight. I've heard that maybe I should have kept taking it longer, but there was no way I could do that. I couldn't even function and I have children to take care of. My husband was the first to notice I wasen't being myself. I became even more depressed on this drug due to lack of sleep and feeling so strange.

It has changed my life.  Thank you Glaxo Smith Kline for creating such a wonderful drug.  I struggled with anxiety and feeling agitated about small, insignificant things all my life and now that is all gone.  One thing I will say is that I found a tremendous difference between the generic drug and the named brand drug.  I had severe mood swings while taking the generic.  You pay more for the named brand but maybe there is a reason for that. I love you Wellbutrin!!!

So my obgyn doc rx'd Wellbutrin XL, said it was an excellent drug.  When this drug was in my system after about 5 wks, my depression sunk to the lowest EVER; mood swings were almost out of control, very unlike my character, to where eventually I felt suicidal and completely hopeless like life was just not worth living.  I called the dr ofc told them this drug was evil!  That I flushed it down the toilet.  It scared the you know what out of me... I am currently on Zoloft 50mg now, and that is working great for me.

However, Wellbutrin has the least side effects, and I don't feel like I'm taking an antidepressant.  I simply feel the absence of the extremely depressed feelings.  Yes... the things that bothered me before are still present in my mind, but I am able to live with them and put them into a more healthy perspective.  Plus, I can enjoy life regardless of its ups and downs.  Now, to me ... THAT'S living!

After spending a year getting off of it, and another year trying to stay off of Anti-depressants altogether (cognitive therapy as alternative) I threw in the towel and sought 'something new' from healthcare provider.  Aside from forgetting to take it some days, I seem to tolerate it well.  I've not exactly been happy-go-lucky, but considering the despair I'd experienced during the preceding year, I feel it's been effective overall.  I'm not where I want to be yet, but I can conceive of 'getting there' - which is major progress in my book.

It does curb depression and make life more manageable.  I tried to get off of it twice, thinking I did not have depression anymore, but I do, and always will.  I am a generally happy person, and work on a lot of projects.  I can see the glass half full or half empty.  WellbutrinXL oral helps me see the glass half full.
I have tried several other anti-depressants, including one that is supposed to help for chronic pain.  That one had too many sexual side effects.  The other one had a weight gain factor.  One of them made me MORE depressed.  One made me tired.  WellbutrinXL oral allowed me to have energy, lose a small amount of weight, I had no sexual side effects, and was able to wake up in the morning.  It gave me more energy than the rest of them.  I am very happy with it, and would recommend it to a friend.  I even heard it helps people quit smoking."

I don't want those kinds of feelings to distract me from my life's work or from the people, places, activities, and things I believe are important toward my individual and societal integrity at my age (over 50).  So, my doctor put me on Lexapro with the generic Wellbutrin and the mania has stopped and the anxiety has diminished as well.  And I haven't had a cigarette in over three months!  Life is liveable again, and life is worth living again.  Balance and stability are real again.  I am real again.

But, on that note, I do seem a bit more motivated. I’ve been on other meds for awhile and have been ‘numb’ since, so I’m not sure how this affected it, other than not making it any better.
11$Major Depressive Disorder$10/12/2018 4:46:43 PM$Reviewer: Wednesday, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was initially prescribed 21 tablets of Bupropion XL 150 mg to take every morning for 3 weeks for depression and nicotine addiction. During the first week I felt much more energetic and somewhat euphoric at times. I also noticed my nicotine cravings begin to dissipate and I began having vivid dreams every time I went to sleep. In week two I had no nicotine cravings at all, but I started having frequent panic attacks and crying spells. By week 3 I was actively suicidal, and my prescriber discontinued my course of treament with this medication. It has only been one day since I stopped taking Bupropion and I feel like my normal depressed self again which I welcome back with open arms as opposed to the extremely emotional and impulsive version. I feel less focused and a little bereaved, but not unbearably so. On a positive note, the thought of smoking a cigarette or vaping nicotine is revolting to me. I hope it stays that way.

About a week ago I accidentally stopped taking it. Yesterday I took it and was drugged and sleeping for six hours. I could barely get up. Has anyone had this happen.? It is not listed as a side affect.
16$Major Depressive Disorder$11/27/2017 11:25:45 PM$Reviewer: DesignerType, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"Bupropion has literally saved my life.  I didn't want to live before I started taking it.  I have been taking it for 17  years now.  The few side effects it has go away after about six weeks of taking it.  At first I was a bit shaky, had mild headaches, slight insomnia.  These side effects went away, but even if they didn't go away they were more tolerable than depression.  The brand name (Wellbutrin) works better than the generic (Bupropion) but unless you have $16,000 - $18,000 per year to spend you better use generic. (I'm not exaggerating this price)  Another tip:   I have found with the generic it's best to use the 100 mg three times per day vs. the 300 mg XL one time per day.  The generic XL (extended release) does not work for me.  It took me literally years to figure this out so...you're welcome.  :)   "
25$Major Depressive Disorder$9/17/2016 2:17:51 AM$Reviewer: CloudsInMyCoffee, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I am a seven  year user of Bupropion. Over the years I have changed dosages from 300 to 350, from 450 to 400, back down to 300, recently back to 450. There is a persistent sadness tightly woven through the fabric of my emotions and feelings. I function fairly well most of the time. Sometimes I feel stuck. I don't want to do anything except space out. I get stuck in my own head like I'm withdrawn into my own bubble. None the less. the Bupropion has enabled me to get up off my ass and most forward with life. Whenever I feel super stuck, I check in with my therapist and doctor. Sometimes we tweak the dosage. I also think some generic brands are poor quality. If you can get Wellbutrin, do it. The generic stuff can be wonky sometimes and I'm not trying to play Russian Roulette with my life. Coupled with therapy and a sharp progressive doctor, I can manage.

I've been diagnosed with depression bordering on major depression. I've gone thru 4 knee surgeries and now I've had a pacemaker installed. All this happened within the last 18 months. I went from a wheelchair to walking with my cane during that time. I feel my body is breaking down. My exercise routine has been hindered. I can't do the things I could've done before. I have to accept that I'm getting old! All of these factors contributed to taking Bupropion. I have to tell my mental health provider on the next session; that I've increased my dosage. This stems from the latest problems that have transpired. I increased the dosage from 300mg to 400mg. I feel so much better. I see her every 120 days. She knows everything about me. Initially asking many questions ranging from my social life to my sex life. That's to determine what dosage I needed. The only problem; I can't get an erection. Bupropion has the least sexual side effect on that problem. I'll have to live with it. But it really upsets me. I feel that my male ego has been devastated. But life goes on. We review how things are going. She keeps my medical file up to date. We come to an agreement what dosage I need after discussing what's been going on in my life. She's really a great nurse practitioner. Someone to talk and listen to. I enjoy going to see her. I look forward to all of my future sessions with her.

62$Major Depressive Disorder$9/7/2014 8:37:07 AM$Reviewer: Siegfried, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I am very satisfied with Bupropion HCL. I was on it 3 years ago. But stopped. Now, my nurse practitioner asked many questions stemming from my sexual activity, diet, contact with friends and family, church and other things. She compiled a history about me. She's a fantastic person. She decided my starting dosage would be two 100mg tablets; one when I wake up and the other at noon. We will discuss the dosage after two months. At that time she might increase my dosage. For me it is an appetite suppressant. I have some sexual side effects; I take Trazedone to maintain my erection. And it helps me go to sleep. You really need to work together to overcome depression. Overall Bupropion HCL works for me.

We literally LIVED at the hospital for 6 months.  I couldn't see straight, through the anxiety and depression.  I thought I would never laugh, smile, sing, dance, or live again.  On Wellbutrin, which I'm taking in 3 sustained release tablets a day (300 mg), I can laugh, smile, sing, dance and live again.  I also take Sertraline (another antidepressant), but it wasn't enough.  Wellbutrin was added after months of Sertraline didn't help completely and made me VERY sleepy.  Wellbutrin helped a little with energy and significantly with mood.  I suppose if I got enough sleep, Wellbutrin could really help with my energy levels, but I'm happy enough being able to get up in the morning and stay awake at work (most days).  Seriously, on Wellbutrin I can laugh again.

75$Major Depressive Disorder$5/27/2014 11:48:36 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$3$5$I experienced too many side effects with SSRI's so switched to Bupropion. It ended up being the only antidepressant I could take.  It helped with my energy level although I never really felt the same after the major depressive episode which put me on antidepressants in the first place.  It was very easy to come off of, no side effects but I felt a bit of a decrease in energy with an increased feeling of apathy, lack of interest, little enthusiasm.  After a couple of months, I started to gain weight for no apparent reason. I wasn't eating more; after another month or so the weight started increasing at a faster rate. Because of some other symptoms, I believe I need glandular support, mainly thyroid, so am taking supplements and natural remedies. I have begun to lose a little weight and the muscle heaviness I was feeling is subsiding. Of course I'm still seeing my counselor; working on relationships, self-esteem and lots of other stuff. If you're gaining weight after Bupropion and wonder if that is the reason, it very well could be. What's working for me is Iodine,Selenium,L-Tyrosine. I've always been a regular exerciser (running) but that wasn't keeping my weight under control like it always has, and it was becoming more difficult because of the sluggishness I was feeling, then the extra weight to carry around.

An unexpected side effect of this medicine also includes losing the desire to smoke. The only downside to this medication in my opinion, is that it took eight weeks to really absorb into my blood before it effectively helped with my anxiety and depression.

Once my pdoc paired it with an SSRI (Effexor XR), I have noticed a distinctive change in this medication's effects on me. It does cause a general increase in a person's Adrenaline levels, which explains the increased sweating and dry mouth. Most, if not all, side effects are temporary.  But beware going off this drug cold-turkey--it WILL cause electric shock-like sensations in your brain!

Tried Prozac (which made me a wee bit manic), Celexa (which made me sluggish and disconnected) and finally, Wellbutrin SR which has been a godsend.  I really feel like myself and am delighted that all negative thoughts, suicidal and otherwise (i.e., self-doubts) are essentially gone.  I continue to work with an excellent therapist and, after the better part of two years, I am thinking that I may be well enough to begin weaning off the every other week sessions. Pretty good for a man whose paternal grandfather AND paternal uncle both committed suicide.  I am dedicated to my conviction that the depressive streak stops with me.

Zoloft helped my depression but I had terrible nightmares that worsened and turned into night terrors/paralysis couldn't take it anymore. I've been on Wellbutrin XR 150mg for 4 days and already seeing an elevated mood, energy increase, overall feeling like my non depressed active self again and it feels amazing! The downside is that every day so far, 2 hours after taking it, I puke a few times and am nauseous almost all morning. I'm not a breakfast person so the first 2 days I took it on empty stomach, thought that might cause sickness but yesterday and today I ate toast with my dose - didn't make a difference. Today I also noticed a metallic taste in my mouth not sure if that's a side effect though. I'm 5 feet and weigh 117 lbs so I'm not sure if the dose is too much taking all at once, my Dr said it should be a good starting dose so idk. I'll give it a few more days before requesting dose change, definitely not giving up on it bc it's working! 
728$Major Depressive Disorder$2/6/2019 4:59:28 PM$Reviewer: Mike, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I had struggled with depression on my own before finally giving in and seeing a therapist. I resisted therapy and drugs for years- men are supposed to take care of their own problems....aren't they? Well a series of very trying and anxiety ridden events pushed me over the edge and on my way to getting help- I'm glad I reached out. After going over the options my doctor prescribed Wellbutrin extended release in a 150mg once daily dose (in the morning- don't take it in the evening or you will struggle to fall sleep). I have to say that this drug has really helped me. The very low, sad moods are gone, the fits of anger have subsided, I have more patience at work and with family, I haven't had a drink in months and I no longer think about suicide. I have a much easier time controlling my appetite, which with giving up alcohol, has resulted in a loss of about 20 lbs. My wife has remarked many times that I am 'nicer' now that I am on medication. I have to take her word for it. Seems I was stuck in a dark pit of my own making and couldn't figure a way to get out. I was going through the motions and was thoroughly miserable while doing it, and making everyone around me uneasy. This drug isn't a cure all for bad attitudes and badly lived lives but it can help, possibly, if a person is motivated to change. It will wind you up a bit- I do take a mild sedative at night to sleep. I have also found Wellbutrin to reduce libido but only slightly - this seems to run counter to many others experience. I have addressed that little problem by taking very small doses (7mg- 1/4 of a 25mg pill) of Viagra when the time is right. Otherwise there seem to be few negative side effects, at least for me. I don't like to take drugs but I recognize that Wellbutrin is very useful. Its off patent and I ask for the generic (Bupropion- inexpensive). At some point I hope to taper down and get off it but I could stay on it for a long time if I needed to and could live my life fully.

Unfortunately, the opposite happened. I took it for two months and found myself crying at everything, becoming very aggressive and short with the people around me which is very bad in a service career, and becoming more suicidal than I was before I took this medication. It worked amazingly for my friend but I did not metabolize it well at all. I switched to celexa and it worked a million times better.

I took it for a month and had no positive effects, still tired, no energy, couldn't concentrate and it gave me terrible direaha. It also took away what little sex drive I had which Dr. said it wouldn't.  I went back to Dr. and he switched me to Wellbutrin xl titriting up to 300 mg after 150 for first week.

I was going to power through until on the fourth day my eyesight became blurred. Letters appeared to have dropshadows. After contacting my doctor he took me off the meds and said to see an ophthalmologist as the drug could cause glaucoma. I went to the eye clinic and was tested and told I did not have glaucoma. But the doctor said my pupil was a little dialated and that could cause a focus problem. GlaxoSmithKline in their pdf file says this is called ""mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma."" So, if you vision is blurred after taking this, beware. I was hoping it would work for me."

I briefly went up to 300mg and found it to give me the feeling of TOO MUCH COFFEE. Helpful with S.A.D., focus and a very tenacious depression. Honestly, I am so grateful for this drug. I recently ran out of my script and immediately noticed a significant dip in my mood. A bit concerned about going off or having it lose it's efficacy, but for now it's incredibly helpful.

I have since my last baker act which was about a year ago. This antidepressant is the only one that doesn't make me gain weight, so it's the only one I will take. It causes dry mouth for me though and decreases my sex-drive. But, it makes me drink more water and I probably shouldn't be having too much sex anyway I guess. It's the best rx med I've found though since it doesn't pack on lbs. getting fat just makes me feel worse.

The only down side, my Lumosity game scores dropped significantly--I was at 99.8%--it was already lower than what I got before the most recent depressive episode which was in the high 99.9% with several metrics topped out at 100%. After I take the medication, I can barely make 98%. While playing the game, I can feel I am much slower, less sharp, less attentive, but more flexible. "

I should have known better. Years ago my ex husband had a seizure on it. I thought we were different enough that maybe it could help me. Wrong! It made me so I'll in so many ways I am lucky to be alive . I had so many of the side effects I can't list them all. At 52 I had never been to an emergency room until this horrific drug. Some of the side effects I had include waking up drenched in sweat (worse than any hot flash), with a splitting headache, I stood up and was hit with severe nausea and dizziness, made it to the bathroom only to collapse over the toilet where I sobbed uncontrollably for half an hour. This was the final incident that brought me to the ER, where all they cared about was whether or not I was suicidal. Do yourself a favor and Do Not take this drug under any circumstances. 
795$Major Depressive Disorder$1/24/2015 12:21:13 PM$Reviewer: WonderAll, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$My first and worst severe depressive episode had me to believe that I would continue down into the hole I had built for myself. I couldn't see the bright side of a single word, my memory to include short, long, and working were gone, my concentration was shot, and I slept less than 3 hours a night for weeks on end and thus began to experience panic attacks. The first morning after taking Wellbutrin I woke up without shaking uncontrollably. The deep pit of despair was gone. I could still feel its presence because I had so often visited it, but my thoughts would not drag me down with them. The cold words began to bounce off of me. Wellbutrin felt like a shield. I was told it would take weeks for me to feel the effects, not one night, but perhaps I was so far gone that even the tiniest bit of change in my brain chemistry was enough to give me such a sense of improvement. The thoughts were still there, the negativity, Wellbutrin didn't get rid of the way I spoke to myself, but it allowed me to see doubts as lies, it gave me a way to fight back. It gave me a way to see all the put-downs were misconstrued. It took me about a week to understand that there were side-effects to using anti-depressants. I only took it for a month, but I am still feeling the effects. At first I had severe memory loss that had nothing to do with major depressive disorder and a strange emptiness and odd pressure behind my right eye. I also had periods where I would wander, go to the store, grab a coffee, talk to someone, and not remember, as if I had lost an hour of the day. Because I didn't take it for more than 5 weeks, I can't say for sure if the side-affects would have disappeared, but for that time there was also a strange psychedelic feeling, a sense that I had actually been drugged. I've never done anything recreationally before, but it was that feeling you get before being completely knocked out by morphine before a procedure, without the loss of pain associated with it.

Although it gave me a little energy shortly after taking it, it didn’t really do all that much.  Also, in higher doses (450mg), it could make me emotionless and my hands extremely shaky, to the point that I could barely eat.  It helped me feel a little better for a while, but it didn’t really do much.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

The wellbutrin, along with Pristiq, Valium, and Neurotin I am FINALLY myself!! I honestly thought my life was going to be miserable and I was a lost cause because I tried EVERY medication known to man and nothing worked. But the wellbutrin gave me the extra ""umph"" I needed. For the first week I could feel the medicine ""kicking in"". But now I dont, and my days are okay. And remember...what works for one person, may not work for another.

Wellbutrin on the other hand seems to make me procrastinate less. It ""turns the volume down"" on the depressing & suicidal thoughts, gives me energy to do things. It does decrease my appetite, which is good because most of us overeat anyway. I'd say over all this medicine has literally been a life saver."

It took a few weeks but turned the dopamine taps back on near full stream again. Side effects I noticed during this time were weightloss, vivid dreams, poor short-term memory, anxiety(never anxious before), sudden and vivid recollection of very old memories, intensified fight or flight response and longer to get back down to the baseline as well as oddly stronger smelling urine. I found greatly restricting caffeine mitigated some of the jitteriness. Even with some of these odd side effects, I found it to be completely worth it for me to find enjoyment in my life again. It is also much much easier to cycle off than SSRI's and can be used for cycles when needed. I found it took about 5 weeks for me to feel full effects.

After meeting with neuroscience clinic I am now officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the dr. advised that I not continue on Wellbutrin as they do not endorse the 450mg max dose.

I think its anxiety because taking a xanax will alleviate that feeling but really i would rather stay on the immediate release and take it 3x a day rather than this huge 450 mg all at once. Not sure yet if it is working because had a major relapse of major depression. i am praying it works because it's getting old. those of you with recurring depression know the ""crash"" feeling, then the attempt to get back ""up"" and normalize yourself again is so wearing.

The first day I took 150 mg Bupropion (Wellbutrin) I felt less anxious. The night of the second day, I woke up remembering dreams, which I had not done in months, but used to be my usual. According to my psychiatrist it is supposed to increase REM, but many people haven't reported a difference. I happen to experience it. As the first week went on I felt more and more like myself, but with a still slightly drugged feeling. I dropped down to 75mg and my life has been so much easier. I'm not constantly on the edge of feeling like I'm not going to be okay, my suicidal ideation is gone, I can smile and enjoy time with my friends without faking it! It is like I am me again after years of intense MDD and ups and downs (mostly downs) on so many other meds. 
Unfortunately, while all other side effects have ceased, I am continuing to experience a huge amount of hair loss (alopecia) which is a very rare side effect. There is no other drug like this (that works on dopamine and norepinephrine) and therefore no alternatives to try. For now, I'm feeling like I have my life back and I'm not willing to give that up, even if my hair is thinning. "

This medication saved my life and helped me get graduate college. I started feeling better within a week without even trying on 150mg but increased the dose with my doctor to 300mg, which worked the best for me personally. For example, it allowed I was able to stop thinking negatively, could concentrate again, stopped crying all the time, and stabilized my mood at a functional baseline so I could get what I needed out of therapy. All my friends and family told me I was acting more like myself and had my zest for life back. I'm so grateful- before taking it, I did not have enough energy to walk a mile. I had lethargic depression and after taking this medication, I stopped sleeping 14hrs/day, was able to run 3miles like I used to, stopped binge eating, and lost 10lbs after about 5 months on the medication. Once I started getting better (I do not take this medication anymore as my depression resolved after a 9-month combination of Wellbutrin and psychotherapy), I started feeling restless and got agitated, which are side effects and decided with my doctor that I was stable and had enough support in place to stop taking Wellbutrin. I slowly decreased my dose over a month when I did not have a lot of stressful events in my life and consider myself a success story as I rarely have symptoms anymore of MDD. This medication was wonderful and I'm so thankful that it was available when I needed it during the darkest point of my life.

We tried it again last year, same thing, It eas like taking sugar pills.  I was on the brand as my Dr had had poor results with the generic.  I would give anything to have this drug work again and wonder if there are other reported issues with other patients.  So now my rating is no stars as it doesn't work at all, no matter how we changed the dosage.
1621$Major Depressive Disorder$8/2/2014 4:03:57 PM$Reviewer: EricRichardson, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$4$I have been taking meds for depression for over 30 years and except for the MAOIs I have tried them all. I have been on Celexa/citalopram as it seems to work best for me overall. Chronic fatigue is one of my worst symptoms, so as we have many times, my doc and I are supplementing the Celexa with Wellbutrin/bupropion in hopes that the norepi bump would increase my energy. In the past the only difference I noticed was an increase in anxiety, and a practical inability to have an orgasm (anorgasmia.) This time the only difference I notice is anorgasmia. I wanted to post this because I know that Wellbutrin is considered (and shown) to be one of the anti-depressants with the fewest sexual side effects. Experientially, Wellbutrin seems to be essentially worthless as an antidepressant, and exacerbates anxiety. I am thankful I do not smoke, but Wellbutrin is also marketed as Zyban and prescribed for smoking cessation. I do not know what the numbers show for its effectiveness in stopping smoking, but in my humble opinion as anything other than perhaps smoking cessation the med is worthless.

That would swing over days at a time. Wellbutrin nailed it however the constipation was so bad I had the dr switch it for me that lasted just over a month. + side was I was able to quit smoking very easily and feel better in that sense too. Moving on to Effexor this week will see how that works out.

I can go to my g.p. without crying for the first time in years. I still feel blue if my kids upset me but I don't fall apart.  I'm not taking the 300 mg as it made my mouth so dry I had to chew gum all the time and didn't seem to make a difference in how I felt. I did have an incidence of jumping out of my car (not smart) and telling the guy behind me that I couldn't take a right on red because of the sign, a little impulsive I'd say and stupid.

The reaction is often misdiagnosed as a virus, as was in my daughter's case.  After two clinic visits and two trips to the ER, she finally was diagnosed correctly, but had to be hospitalized for a week.   She gained 30 lbs. of fluid in just a few days and was covered with a beet-red rash.  Her major organs were also affected.  She had to be treated with steroids, which is another side-effect story.  Be your own advocate-  if you develop a rash while taking any prescription drug, take it seriously!   Your life depends on it.  DRESS Syndrome is a living nightmare and too many doctors do not have the expertise to recognize it.

However, he did not ween me off of the Celexa.  The Wellbutrin took at least three weeks before I saw a mood improvement.  I definitely was super low during that period.  He had prescribed me a low dose of Xanax during the transition.  My biggest side effects have been nausea, constipation, heavily sweating, insomnia if I take it late in the day.  I aim to take it at least 12 hours before I want to go to sleep.  I am on week four and still experiencing side effects, but I definitely have an improved mood so far.

After three weeks of this, during a family camping trip, I finally started having an allergic reaction where my skin turned a ghostly white, my veins glowed through a bright blue-green, my lips swelled up and split with puss, I had the fever, and had red blotches all over. Not knowing why I kept taking the pill another couple days before going to the hospital. I had a bad experience with this med but I have heard good things from people that weren't allergic to it.

On the second or third day, I noticed a few red dots around my mouth with a white head. After my shower I gently scrapped of the white head (it was very small). By the 6th day I was still very sick to my stomach, had a severe headache and the tiny whiteheads (rash?) had turned huge and they covered my entire mouth area, upper lip and my nose, my cheeks and also my back and breasts. When I took a shower I used mild soap and gently washed these areas, no matter how gentle I was they would all start to bleed and it would not stop. I had to hold a tissue on my entire face for up to 15 minutes with pressure. The rest of the skin on my face was ""dead"" that is the only way I can explain it. I could rub my fingers across my forehead or my upper cheeks and the entire first layer would rub off into large clumps of skin. I stopped taking Wellbutrin after a week and a half. the nausea is gone, the headaches are less frequent and not as intense however my face has over 30 red pimples, scabs, an area of a rash including my back and breasts. I will never put another Wellbutrin in my body again. "

First thing I noticed on the second day of taking it was that I was unusually short of breath, and my heart started being quickly randomly throughout the day. On the fifth day I woke up with a sore left arm, and the pain spread to the left side of my chest. Developed chest pressure and that continued on for the full 8 days that I took the medication and ended when I went off the medicine. My anxiety also seemed to have increased; I could never calm down and my body always felt heavy. However, the only somewhat positive thing I can mention is that I felt that this medicine kind of woke me up a bit; before I was pretty numb, but I started feeling again. The side effects were enough to make me go off of it within 8 days. I hope to try the name brand Wellbutrin to see if there is an improvement.

I have no nasty side effects at all, if anything I have more energy and even started to exercise again after one year of inactivity. Got a couple of bad headaches the first week or so but it dissapeared quickly. In my case it took it 3-4 weeks to work.

1968$Major Depressive Disorder$1/2/2012 1:30:14 AM$Reviewer: hopeful65, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has been a life saving treatment for me.  I have been on multiple drugs for my depression over the last several years and in and out of the hospital several times also.  I was put on the Welbutrin after my last hospitalization for attempting to take my own life earlier this year(2011).  I am currently on the maximum dose and I also take Lamictal(100mg)and Remeron(30 mg) to help with sleep.  I was like a zombie with the 5 meds I was on before my suicide attempt now I feel so much better.  For the first time in 6 yrs I have my energy back, I'm not falling asleep during the day,I am hopeful instead of hopeless and I am back working after an extended medicalleave.  I do see a therapist in addition to the medication currently and attribute the success of my recovery to the combination of the new medicine, therapy and the intensive care I received in my week and a half stay at a psychiatric hospital 6 months ago but I believe the medication change to Welbutrin has made a huge difference.  I hope my experience is helpful to someone out there who is suffering from this medical illness that can be difficult to treat.

1976$Major Depressive Disorder$12/1/2011 3:25:53 PM$Reviewer:  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$On the third week of this medication I started to feel irritable & frustrated leading to full out anger; very scary for a person who has been passive their whole like. My pain level went from 7/10 to 12/10 which made me more irritable & into the circle we go.  By the end of 3rd week I slept 20 minutes @ time.  My thought process is clearer then on Zoloft but can't interact around people so I am on to the next one.

1995$Major Depressive Disorder$10/10/2011 4:31:30 PM$Reviewer: Lex, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$It helped my depression somewhat.  I was nagged by an underlying feeling of anxiety and nauseous stomach.  It definitely improved my sex life.  I had been on Cymbalta and it worked well except in the bedroom.  I give Wellbutrin an OK.  I really need something more effective for depression.  I may take the leap to a new drug called Viibryd which is hyped as offering good depression relief without the sex problems.  I first got on Wellbutrin to knock out the Cymbalta sex effects.  It didn't work.  I may find myself on it to aid the Viibryd if it turns out to be problematic.  Anyway, good luck with Wellbutrin.  If it works for you..that's great.

I have been taking WB for 20+years.  I was taking 450mg a day.  It seems like it's not working as effectively as it did in the early days.  Now my DR has upped my dosage to 600 MG a day. That doesn't seem to be working either.  I'm trying to find a new DR but hate the prospects of being hospitalized for the 5th time."

First time I took this about 5 years ago I was literally having sexual urges constantly so my doctor took me off it after a month of ""bliss but agony"". Well, speaking to my psychiatrist who specializes in meds and heads the state board where I live, Wellbutrin was actually considered being used as a drug for lacking sexual desire when they did their initial studies. This was due to the results of the initial tests showing increased sexual desire of women and actual orgasm without stimulation. It was being studied at this time to see positive effects for depression. It helped me the first time I took it although I felt like a nympho. Back on it again 3 years ago to help libido but doing nothing but causing constipation...no sexual desire at all. Actually wish I was experiencing my initial use ""urges"" that caused me to stop it, was having ""almost orgasms"" at work and couldn't concentrate."

I told my Doc. and she prescribed this because she had prescribed Wellbutrin ER, 200MG taken 2x per day. With the new prescription she also prescribed Doc-Q-Lace. I started the new therapy on a Thursday - Today is Tuesday - no bowel movement yet. Along with the new drug therapy I have included all old stand bys for constipation - prune juice -  prunes - large quantities of fruit and vegatables - copious amounts of water and have stayed mobile to help move things along - no dice.
Trying to find someone else that had this same side effect. My doctor seems to think I am one of 1000 that has had this happen."
