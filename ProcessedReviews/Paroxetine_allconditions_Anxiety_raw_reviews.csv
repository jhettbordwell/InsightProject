8$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/26/2017 4:18:39 AM$Reviewer: NuturingNature, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$I noticed a positive effect the first week I started the treatment (at age 30). The relief was almost overwhelming. I hadn't felt like that since I was a kid. With continued treatment, I lost some of my inhibitions, but I was extremely inhibited, so that's mostly good. One of the first things I noticed was that I wasn't so worried about deadlines anymore, which is kind of not a good thing, but I'm still employed. It became MUCH easier to make decisions, too, without so much cross-talk in my head. I did get tired taking it, so switched to taking it at night. Also, due to lower inhibitions, got addicted to nicotine gum because it energized me. That is something I NEVER would have done before paxil. I'm on a steady dose 14mg nictotine patch now, and it actually works pretty well for me in combination with paxil. Kind of a bummer to be so dependent on two drugs. But I'm actually still living and enjoying it! So, I can't complain. I've been on it 14 years now, never had to increase the dose. A milder form of my old problems can still recur under stress, but it's always temporary. I'm worried about long term effects. If I drink more than 2 drinks, and then take a paxil (I take it at night), I feel like I might die if I fall asleep, and I feel odd the next morning in a way that's different than a normal hangover. I guess that's a good way to keep my consumption in check! Though if I must drink more (social occasion), I'll skip the paxil for a night, and that helps. It's all worth it though for me. I'm still shy, but at least I don't clam up and freeze in groups of people anymore. I can actually talk to more than one person at a time even. And I don't jelly over in a grief I can't define properly. And a lot of other things. All in all, I give this drug a thumbs up. I am a bit peeved that it's advertised as being non-addictive, though.

I was on 40mg daily went to 20 for a few days and then just quit. Been off a week. Other than pretty good headache and dizziness not real bad. I would only recommend this for a short term treament as withdrawls look terrible so buyer beware!!

17$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/22/2015 8:53:18 PM$Reviewer: Ashley, 19-24 Female  (Patient) $4$4$4$"I take 20 mg of Paroxetine which is the generic for Paxil.  I've been on it a little over 6 months.  Works great for me. However I use it only for Anxiety and I think of it as a 'certain limit' of anxiety and my anxiety has been so bad the past month that it breached this wall or limit.  so I may need something additional to this.

42$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/29/2013 10:30:00 AM$Reviewer: mmcd74, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$4$I went on this med a couple of years ago due to overall anxiety levels increasing.  The dosage was 20mG.  It was the second drug tried, the first being Zoloft which I had a severe negative reaction to.  This drug worked well and after an incident that really impacted my anxiety my dose was increased to 40 mG for a period of time.  Eventually I was able to go back to 20mG for a long time.  I am now in a period where I am trying to go off of this drug.  At first, I dropped from 20 mG to 10 mG.  This may have been too big of a jump.  I experienced extreme dizziness that lasted for about 10 days.  My next decrease I went from 10 mG to 5 mG.  I still had a lot of dizziness and it still lasted about 10 days.  I am currently at 5 mG and getting ready to do my next decrease.  I am unsure if I will try to go to every other day of 5 mG or just try to stop cold turkey.  If you are decreasing dosage I would recommend finding a stretch of time where you don't have much going on due to these side effects.  From what I have looked up, mine are actually milder than many other people have reported.  I decided to go off of this drug because I was experiencing extreme fatigue and have gained a lot of weight and wanted to see if it was impacting these.  Since decreasing dosage I have noticed much more energy.  I would still recommend it because it helped me through a period of extreme anxiety, but it does look like it may have been contributing to my extreme fatigue.  While I am excited to go completely off of this drug I would use it again if my anxiety ever returned to such high levels.  
47$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/2/2013 10:40:43 PM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$Thirty mg's of this medication caused me two trips to the hospital with severe side effects which included psychotic symptoms. I would not recommend this medication to anyone. If you are a person who is aware that you are unable to tolerate anti-depressants, don't consider taking this medication. Read all the warning labels and use extreme caution if you decide to even try it!

60$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/28/2012 10:33:24 AM$Reviewer: barbie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Paxil has been a godsend for me. After taking it, I immediately stopped worrying about EVERYTHING! Makes me feel normal and not afraid to approach new situations. Was a bit hard to get used to it.  Maybe took about 2 weeks before not having diarrhea and initial dizziness. If a dose is missed, I know, as I feel dizzy. Other than that, I feel so normal and confident.  Not sure I ever want to wean off this medication.  Im sure it works differently for every person. Guess I was lucky my first time around, because it has worked so well for me and have never had to experiment with other brands.

108$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$12/31/2010 10:11:34 PM$Reviewer: Heather, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I've been on Paroxetine for 12 months.  It has worked well for me at 30mg for most of the time.  Positive effects: I got my life back within a few days.  Within two months I was 'me' again.  Side effects: loss in sex drive, inability to be satiated at mealtime (weight gain), over-heating (especially after exercise), occasional stuttering or loss-of-words, problems urinating (when tired), & twitchy muscles (when tired).  Believe it or not, all of this has been a piece of cake compared to the nightmarish anxiety I was living with 24/7 for years.

I'm now on 40mg.  The last two months (out of 12 on the drug) I have been having weird dizzy spells, like I'm being shocked.  I switched to decaf coffee, I talked to the doc, I've experimented with nutrition (high, moderate, vs. low carb intake, etc).  Nothing is working.  These dizzy spells drive me nuts, much more than the other symptoms.  I'm going to ask the doc to begin taking me off the drug, though she wants to keep me on for another 6 months.  The dizziness, although not painful or nauseating, is simply jarring.  Also, my driving-anxiety has resurfaced (only when others are driving), but no other anxiety symptoms (like cyclic thinking or social phobia, etc) have resurged.  It's been a nice year."

Started to lose its effectiveness so my Psych is weaning me off. The only side effects were no libido and trouble sleeping. Three days ago started going from 20mg to 10mg.

193$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/24/2009 11:25:16 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"I started this medicine to help control anxiety and help with depression.  Was taking prozac which worked well for depression but not so much anxiety.  
   First 2 days were rough.  Headache and slept all day first day. Then tired and yawning nonstop second day. Still get the yawns once in a while. Have fantastically bizarre dreams now and then.  Has helped me get to sleep right away at night. Use to have trouble putting myself to bed.  I did have trouble getting up in the morning but that has passed.
   Also have experienced longer intercourse time to ejaculation with better orgasms.  Went from 1 to 2 minutes to 10 to 15.  Have a decreased libido but I can focus on other things rather than sex.  (My wife likes both these side effects.)
    It has helped with my anxiety greatly almost to a fault.  I've found myself saying some things that are inappropriate for the social settings I'm in.  Overall it has been a blessing though.  I no longer obsess over things that might happen and am able to talk in front of large groups without panic attacks.  I joked with a friend that it was like being the character in the movie Office Space who gets hypnotized into not having a care in the world...I'll be taking down the walls to my cubicle and cleaning fish on my office desk next.
     I do find that I still have a certain level of depression.  I don't think I'll give up on the drug though.  I have yet to start exercising and doing the other things I need to do to help deal with that.  
     So all I can say is that it seems to be working for me.  I hope you find what works for you and don't give up til you do!

I was to the point that I wanted to sleep all the time and could no matter what time of day it was.  I would take 4 hour naps on the weekends.  You become semi emotionally numb and the sex drive disappears.  I am in the process of stepping down off this medicine to cymbalta.  I have my sex drive back and do not sleep well anymore.
