I got the feeling of drinking too much coffee right away. The coffee feeling went on and off, I also yawned too much after two weeks(40-50 times per day for 3-4 days). All of these went away after a month. I felt so good after, it seems I am a new person, not as tired as before not easy to get depressed or mad as before.
This medicine works perfectly for me."

8$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/14/2017 3:23:35 AM$Reviewer: Fenale43, 35-44 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$2$3$It does nothing for me, except maybe not cry so much. Instead now I still feel depressed, but I'm more numb in how I react and my empathy seems to have almost gone. I had tons of empathy before, probably too much. I know being like this is not normal. I know empathy, I just FEEL it less now.

My doctor decided to first max out my zoloft dosage to see if that would help. It somewhat did, but not to out satisfaction and it made me very sedated. We then decided to switch me to prozac as it is the most stimulating and i was looking for something to give me energy. Over several weeks, i weened myself off of the 200mg a day zoloft (down 50mg a week) and up to 60mg proac (20 mg per week until 60mg). The transition period was tough. I was unable to distinguish if the side effects were from discontinuing the zoloft or beginning the proac. By the time I stopped taking the zoloft, I was on 60mg prozac/day. I was irritable, anxious, and unable to have a full night's sleep. I would wake up every 1-2 hours. I also have ativan to take when needed and it surely helped with the sleeping and daily panic attacks. after several weeks, I thought that the prozac was beginning to work. However, I was wrong. I had severe side effects that would not go away. Mainly, joint pain, irritability, lack of motivation and concentration. I also noticed bruises on the inside of my thighs that came out of nowhere. I went back to my doctor and we lowered my dose to 40mg/day. a week later, after having the same side effects on top of fever, night sweats, and just did not feel right. I called my doc and she recommended i go to the ER to rule out neuroleptic malignant sydrome (later found out that is caused by antipsychotics, NOT antidepressants). we decided to end the prozac as it was clearly not working right with my body. I am beginning 10mg of lexapro tomorrow and am trying to be optimistic. I had great success with zoloft until it pooped out and am really hoping that the lexapro will work just as good as the zoloft. I know everyone's mind and body reacts differently, but for me the prozac was a failure. Just work closely wit your doctor, you know your body. Peace to all :)

I have been taking Fluoxetine for several years now, and for my depression, it has worked the best out of all of them. However, in the past 2 weeks I have weaned myself off the drug due to the side effects I have lived with for years. I am tired all the time, I get bad headaches, and have gained 30 pounds! I had vivid dreams which were sometimes disturbing, and had trouble falling asleep at night. It also decreased my libido immensely! BUT, if you are severely depressed I would highly recommend Fluoxetine over any of the others! But then again, everyone is different....

27$Condition: Depression$2/19/2015 8:45:41 AM$Reviewer: kc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking Fluoxetine for nearly 20 years. Increased my dosage one time about 5 years ago. It helps me keep my patience and keeps my anxiety in check.  It levels out my mood swings. I've tried to go off of it a few times.  It is clear within a few weeks that my patience and nerves are not good when I'm not taking it regularly.  The only side effect I've noticed is bad breath.  Occasionally it seems I have a hard time focusing, but I can't say that's the medicine for sure.  Others have mentioned low energy and sex drive but I've not had those issues at all.   Overall, it has been a real lifesaver for me.  I'll take the bad breath any day over the depression and anxiety.

It does have side effects that are pretty bad, but it was a trade I had to make. Sex life went to zero, loss of energy and low white blood cell count. the white blood cell count showed up as being in the very bottom of the normal range, I found later on the internet that it was a side effect. I had to inform my doctor as he did not know it.
30$Condition: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder$12/11/2014 6:03:41 AM$Reviewer: Eleanor, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was prescribed this medication not long after being discharged for a charity providing cognitive-behavioural therapy. I was having difficulty with the therapy by myself after a bad month.
For the first week, side-effects included restlessness but also feeling tired and lethargic on 5ml. After the first week however I no longer hand any side-effects, and began to slowly find commitment to the therapy techniques easier.
I currently take 7.5mls and am very happy with myself. I do not feel as tired and disinterested in life. Obsessive thoughts are a rarity, and OCD no longer controls my day.
I am very happy with my medication, and I wish others who wish to try it the best."

Cons: Tired. I found that taking a low dose (10mg) daily works best, and bump it up to 20mg the week before my menstrual cycle. Although it makes me tired, I feel the benefit out weighs the side effect."

Then I noticed I had no emotion at all, no happiness, sadness, anything, I kept my cool even when some guy was trying to fight me, I barley even reacted.
I was on the lowest dose possible.
Then I also noticed my interest in girls faded drastically, I began to wonder how I even found them attractive, arousal was very hard to achieve as well, same with keeping an erection.
So today, I decided to not take it.
And you know what? I felt that attraction to girls come back, I even felt happier, easier to talk to my friends, just generally better, as if I never had depression or anxiety, although I can still feel some of my social anxiety.
I hear it's not a good idea to stop taking anti-depressants immediately, instead slowly take less and less...But I'm already taking the lowest dose!

It has taken the ""edge off"" when needed; my attitude is better, family life is going better. No adverse sexual side effects. Seems to have enhanced my desire to embrace the electronic age of convenience and communication capabilities. Even learning how to better communicate with teenage grandchildren.

My psychiatrist began with 5 milligrams and gradually tapered the dose up to 40, then 60. 

I experienced severe fatigue, nightmares and excessive yawning after adjusting to the 60 milligrams. 

The dosage was dropped back to 40 milligrams. Th side-effects I experience now (mild, occasional heartburn, light fatigue) are easily outweighed by the relief of my OCD & PTSD symptoms. 

In my experience, Fluoxetine will not take away every symptom you have; It isn't a magic pill. However, what it *will* do is lessen the severity of the symptoms and aid you in dealing with them."

i havent experienced any negative side effects (tiredness, etc). the only thing is that it almost completely wipes out my appetite so i have to force myself to eat properly. but if that's the worst side effect, then i'll take it! 
for me, the pros DEF outweigh the decreased appetite. 
this medicine has changed my life. i'm able to function and deal with daily life stresses without feeling like i'm going to lose my ish!

My psychiatrist recommended I switch to Prozac 20 mg then take two every day after two weeks, and I have been very pleased. I don't feel exhausted all day, and I don't have that gnawing hunger in my stomach anymore. I woke up the other morning genuinely excited, and that hasn't happened in three years.

131$Condition: Depression$7/7/2011 11:26:22 AM$Reviewer: lontheotherside, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$5$I've been taking fluoxetine 20mg daily for the past 6 months.. I thought all was fine..no side effect, or so I thought, but within the past week I've started having headaches, waking up 2-3 during the night, muscle aches, and cycling mood swings..  Many of these symptoms I have before the med, minus the headaches....which leaves me unable to function. I've taken Lexapro, Paxil, Effexor, Zoloft, to name a few where the side effects showed up sooner, rather than later... Has anyone else had this experience?  I called my doctor, waiting for him to respond.... Thanks for the feedback!!. 
132$Condition: Depression$7/7/2011 10:56:16 AM$Reviewer: Amylein17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This is a follow up review for Celexa from July 2010, but I am currently on fluoxetine and review it further down. I took generic Celexa for 9-10 months. I gained about 10 pounds and was sleeping excessively. I would sleep 8 hours each night and still felt like I needed a nap every day. I went off this medicine to try ibuprpion to help me quit smoking. That was a failure-felt like a witch and it wasn't very effective at helping me stop smoking. After I went off ibupropion, I tried not taking any medicine, but rather supplements. I took 5HTP (for depression) and valerian root for anxiety for about a month. It helped a little, but not like AD medication. So I told my doctor I wanted something that made me feel like Celexa (happy, no worries, emotionally awesome), but that wouldn't make me hungry and sleepy all the time. She prescribed generic prozac which I've been taking for a little over a month. I really like it so far-normal appetitie, sleeping ok, and feel good emotionally. I have noticed a bit of vaginal tenderness/inflammation, but I presume that is happening due to decreased frequency of sex. Other reviewers of generic prozac have said they've noticed it as well. As with Celexa, my libido has decreased, but that has actually helped since my partner has a weaker than libido than I did before depression hit. Overall, I'm very satisfied with generic prozac. Will follow up in the future if anything changes.

I seem to be slightly happier but Dr. said it could take up to 5 weeks to feel the full effects. I don't like the fact that I can't sleep through the night at all. I usually wake up 3 or 4 times each night & that makes for a long day at work. I've also noticed some light-headed feelings at times and even a bit dizzy a couple of times. I'm willing to stick with it in order to get back to enjoying life again. Dr. said I'm in the early stages of depression. I just felt 'blah' most of the time even when things were going well. I just need some good sleep! God is good & I'll keep praying and living right & if it's in His will for me to get better then I will. One more thing I've noticed is when I actually do sleep I have very vivid dreams of things & people that I've long forgotten about. Early childhood things, school friends, family that's passed on...that's a bit odd for me.

I started on 20mg and eventually cut back to 10mg. I have taken Sarafem for almost 10 years. (I went off it only when I was expecting my third son.) Negative side effects were some weight gain and decreased libido, which is why I cut back to 10 mg and noticed some improvement. I do find it's harder to lose weight than before, so I exercise more and eat healthy most of the time.  I openly speak with others about my success with fluoxetine, as I think that meds to treat mental health sometimes get a bad rap. It ""smooths out my rough edges""... I am still me but more level-headed, calm, focused and happy.  Even after having a hysterectomy, (I still have my ovaries) I find it is a very effective medication for me. "

As long as I take fluoxetine as prescribed (20mg 2x a day), I'm fine and the depressing thoughts aren't with me.  The only consistent side effect is ringing in my ears.  Annoying, but not as devasting as depression.  I highly recommend this med.

I don't think the medicine has taken effect yet, but I'm trying to be patient because it can take up to 5 weeks to start working.  I'm hoping this happens sooner than later because, as most of you have probably experienced, I'm struggling just to get out of bed right now.  I just wanted to let my fellow headache-sufferers know that mine went away (thank God!) after about 3 weeks.  Hang in there!

Finally found one that works well. I've been prescribed 10mg of Fluoxetine daily (generic form of Prozac)for 6 months. However it has an overwelming side effect of involuntary jaw tightening & clenching. This side effect is not listed on the label and my doctor hasn't heard of this problem. My GYN suggested non generic stating it may contain purer ingredients, but $390 for 30 days w/insurance is not in the budget. I can only take 1 pill a week to minimize the side effect now, so it's not debilitating. Unfortunately I'm not getting the full benefit. I'd like to know if anyone out there has had a similar side effect and if they found a solution? Hate to stop fluoxetine since it works so well on depression."

My doctor have me fluoxetine and I have been taking it everyday, soon I was feeling better and able to function in everyday life. now I feel so much better.

It's actually something that been around with me since 6th grade or possibly even before. Anyways, this drug has opened a new world for me. When it was first prescribed to me, I was nervous that it'd have severe side effects, but I was also excited to have something that could help fight my anxiety. I had the usual side effects at first:nausea,drowziness, and a little bit of dizzyness. But anyways, I've been on it for 2 months now, going on 3 months, and it has worked wonders for me. I still get nervous in social situations, and the thought of public embarassment, but now I'm less afraid to talk to people and attempt to get involved with something. I'm able to be able to largely drown out my anxious thoughts with music or other ways of getting it off my mind. I still have my anxious thoughts though, because fighting social anxiety takes a long time. I still get upset easily though, and mad sometimes but even some of that is starting to improve a little. I also see a therapist and a school adjustment counselor in addition to taking madication, and they're very kind, which helps me even more. Fluoxetine is an amazing drug, and it has helped me function better in social situations.

Today I'm back re-reading comments to see if others have some of the annoying symptoms I currently deal with.  Joint pain, morning headaches, a 25 pound weight gain and vaginal inflammation. I'm only on 10 mg, and don't feel that depressed, but having none of my clothes fit and just going from size 12 to 16, makes me fearful of where I'm going to go from here.  I'd rather be thin and depressed and look good in my clothes than be heavy and self conscious.  I'm going off the meds for now to lose the weight. I don't remember what other anti depressant made me gain weight, but I was in this same boat 2 years ago, and the weight came off quickly once I stopped the med.  Perhaps I'll just exercise a lot and hope the endorphins will kick in and soothe the depression.  I'll probably be writing again in 3 months saying I'm going back on the med, but for now I just want to lose this weight!

I started feeling less effective about a year ago, so I tried 40 mg/day for about a month - it made me feel like I had no emotions - scary.  I went back to the 20 mg/day.  Recently, my pms symptoms started to get worse, so after reading that Sarafem is supposed to be better for pms, I tried switching to fluoxetine 20 mg/day.  I had high hopes after the first month - weird dreams - I actually woke up giggling two nights in a row - but my pms symptoms were significantly less noticeable.  Still had the underlying depression (seems I can't get away from it).  So my doc switched me to 40 mg/day of fluoxetine.  The first two weeks on the higher dosage were okay, but then came the pms - the higher dosage actually exacerbated the symptoms and made them worse than when I was on the citalopram.  I was agitated, jumpy, nervous, crabby, easily angered, couldn't think straight - scary.  So I'm going back to the 20 mg/day of citalopram - it seems to work best to ""take the edge off"" and keep me from being so depressed."

I am a very skeptical person when it comes to any time of medication- I NEVER take anything unless I absolutely have to. With that said, I am extremely worried about sidefects of this medicine. I don't want to feel worse. I would like to know what is the time most of you take this medicine, in the morning or at night?

208$Condition: Depression$1/10/2010 10:46:15 PM$Reviewer: relaxmax, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$4$To begin with, it seems that I have been going through phases of depression for over 10 years since my mother became ill and I was her caregiver. Nonetheless, I never realized how strong the depression had a hold of my life and I simply excused the symptoms, believing that it would pass. Overtime, I noticed that I was unable to regain management over basic living functions, such as; paying bills, sleeping, exercising, regular house cleaning, etc. Now, I have recently shared more with my physician and he's determined that the sum of my problems originates from long-term depression combined with anxiety. It may seem premature; however, he prescribed me Fluoxetine and in only 3-days, I see a difference in my behavior. I'm beginning to care about and focus more on personal important matters. The only side-effect, thus far, are vivid dreams, nothing serious.  I recommend this medication as a starter treatment if medically possible. 
209$Condition: Depression$1/10/2010 3:24:45 PM$Reviewer: Jan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have tried several antidepressants, but this is the first to work well with little side effects.  Only on 10 mg for a couple months now, but feel so much better.  Used to be sad all the time and socially isolated myself.  Now I want to see people and go out more.  My problems began after a car accident (got rear ended) 6 years ago, when I began having back pain that still has not resolved, even after seeing some of the best physical therapists available and faithfully doing the exercises again and again.  I finally accepted that I would probably never be better and always be sad and in pain.  Even though the pain is not better, I am happy at least for a bit every day.  Doing exercise seems like a good idea again, even though it won't make me better, it will keep me from getting worse.  Side effects are: sleeping more, weight gain, vivid dreams, but other than that not bad.  I am so glad my pain Doctor recommended this drug.

I've been on it three years and it has been the best decision I ever made. For over a decade prior, there was thundering black cloud of negative energy in my head constantly interfering with my enjoyment of life.  The fluoxetine removed the black cloud and I don't worry about silly things anymore.  Side effects have been essentially non-existent, and it is very inexpensive. A brief experiment to reduce my dosage resulted in depressive symptoms returning, so I am happy to just stay on it for life.

Since starting this drug 5 months ago I have been able to sleep full nights (it still causes me to pass out), and for about 2 weeks I had the worst case of cotton mouth but it went away. other than those minor side-effects, the drug has helped me gain control of my self again and my wife says it's helped with my road rage (who doesnt hate 8am traffic?) and just being more approachable. Taking drugs such as this however is a personal choice, and should be seen what are the benefits toward you and your goals for yourself. And don't skip dosages, you will have nasty withdrawls. I have not missed one. So long story short (too late) I'm highly satisfied with the drug.

I've been able to easily quit smoking (14 year habit) and have improved a stomach condition. I read recently that Serotonin also lives in your intestines, so I assume that Fluoxetine is helping relieve the pain and rapid, loose stools associated with my stomach issues.

One big Plus is that It helped me quit smoking!! I used to smoke half a pack a day now none! and i feel great! i would recommend this to anyone that smokes! you can quit with this!  when i first started taking prozac it was making me a little tired but now after 2 months it doesnt bother me.  So if you want to try this, please do, and give it time to work before you give up on it, it will be worth the wait trust me.

I would fear a panick attack and that would set off a panick attack. By this time I thought that if this couldn't be remedied I thought about suicide. It was many months of horror and grimness and I was far from my normal self. Doc tried me on Buspar (Busparone). Only helped about 30%. Then tried me on 10mg of Fluoxetine and it was working very well even within a few days. I've been on it 8 months and it's been an ABSOLUTE MIRACLE! Also with the panick I was having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems. I saw a specialist for that. Lo and behold, between my two docs, I learned that I was low on seratonin, which is not only in the brain but also (normally) in abundance in the intestines. So both ""illnesses"" were indicating low seratonin. Both illnesses went away with Fluoxetine. I've also had a lifelong struggle with excessive daytime sleepiness, or being in a non-motivated, non-functional state akin to alpha meditation level; this is a part of my A.D.D. I still had an issue with this after being on fluoxetine, so I went back on Concerta (long-acting Ritalin) 18mg (lowest dose) taken in the morning, and I have REALLY returned to my real self: go getter, doer, creative again, motivated, upbeat, etc. Because the Concerta keeps me at a normal, alert level during the day, I now sleep like a baby at night. The Concerta has not had any negative effect towards anxiety either, so I've been on top of the world, and I don't fear the future any more.
In fact, in the last few months, I've been the mediator in a very difficult family situation, and have been so mellow and yet so effective at it (unlike my past anxietal response to my family's issues), way better than even before my PTSD. I thank God for these medications every day!
And so does my husband, kids and grandkids!"

Since the drug started taking effect my energy level has increased 10 fold, I'm a much happier person, and it has given me the upper hand in my emotions... I control them, They do not control me. I feel better than I have in years. My only complaint which is relatively minor is that I've noticed ""jittery'ness"" I feel like I need to constantly be moving, sometimes its hard to concentrate, and falling asleep can be rough. But the smile on my fiances face when he realizes that I'm happy, and that the good days are far greater than the bad make any negative points seem pretty small!"

A few of them actually made me very uptight and nervous. Welbutrin worked well with the exception that it caused insomnia (I was getting 2-4 hours sleep a night). 20 mg daily of fluoxetine has not only taken the edge off, it keeps me on an even keel. I'm less likely to bite someones head off or have a temper tantrum.

I am currently not taking it, but I am reconsidering changing my current medication back to Prozac due to cost and effectiveness.  Also the tolerability/effectiveness ratio was pretty good.  I miss the sense of confidence and 'well being' it gave me.  It's not perfect however, some of the down sides include: knocking out your libido, causing some jitterness, and mild apathy; but was very helpful for Depression, OCD and blocking panic attacks.  In fact Prozac didn't cause much weigh gain (compared to the other anti-depressants out there) and is FDA approved for many ailments not necessary related to depression. I have been on the standard strength for 7 years and it slowly loses its effectiveness over the years, but I slight raise in dose might help.  I went off to try Cymbalta and Lexapro and probably will return to the Prozac

320$Condition: Depression$5/20/2008 7:22:37 PM$Reviewer: anonymous, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking 20mg of Fluoxetine about a month and a half ago to try to get a hold of my depression. I have had depression on and off for probably 6-8 years or so (I am now 24). I've tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and another anti-depression medicine, but Fluoxetine seems to be helping me the best. Some of the other medications actually made things worse for me. I have been dealing with a lot of stressful things in my life over the past few years (and even more here recently), but this has definitely helped me tremendously. The only negative side effect I have experienced thus far with Fluoxetine is losing some sexual desire. This was/is a problem for me because my wife and I are currently trying to conceive. I have never had a problem in this department and actually I would say I had more desire when it comes to sex than most others. Just here recently I think I am starting to get back to normal a little bit in that department. I feel like my sexual desire may be coming back to me like it was before getting on this medication. Overall, I really like Fluoxetine and I think it's worth a shot if you are experiencing depression.

So before I decided to pursue my graduate degree, I knew that I would have to do something.  I talked to the doctor and she put me on a 10mg dose (which didn't do much, but allowed me to see if I could tolerate the medication and ease into taking an antidepressant).  After a couple weeks we stepped it up to the 20mg dose, and I wish that I had started this medication years ago!  The dose is low enough that I've recognized no side effects other than some trouble falling asleep during the first few weeks that I took the medication.  I sleep fine now, and all the problems with anxiety and depression are so much better.  I have to take it with food, though, or I get a bit of reflux.

It has honestly changed my life.  I wish I would have started taking it a lot sooner.  I have suffered from, what my doctors called,PMDD.  I was depressed, anxious and easily frustrated at some points of the month which seemed to center around my menstrual period.  I would cry for no reason, get upset or mad for no reason, I was super sensative, got frustrated VERY easily and was extremely anxious at times.  It interfered with all of my relationships - my family (especially my parents), my boyfriend, my friends (especially my rooommate and best friend).  I was reluctant to start taking this medication, as I was afraid to feel like a different person or TOO happy or disconnected with reality.  After reading reviews, I decided to start it... it was worth a shot.  I'm going on my 8th month and I feel like myself with a happy outlook on life, a more balanced mood and more control over my emotions.  My frustration level has gone WAY down, which was one of my biggest problems.  My relationships have become better and easier... and everyone notices a huge difference in my mood and personality.  The ONLY negative I have found is that I have gained about 10 pounds since starting it and my doctor says that is is related to the medication.  Totally worth it though!

I only took 10 mg for 14 days.  Yes, it does take the edge off, however I had a very difficult time sleeping.  I would lie awake for two hours some nights which is never usually an issue for me.  Another issue was that I could not achieve orgasm.  I had an option to cut the 10mg in half but I decided against it.  I will try a more natural route or even consider getting back on birth control.

I have to say I'm thrilled with the results so far. I am more stable in mood, my breasts weren't tender with my period, I have less symptoms of PMDD (my hubby noticed a difference!) and I just feel more like myself. I take it at night b/c it tends to make me a little tired if I take it in the morning. I have also lost weight which has been an issue with my past history of anorexia. I am never hungry. The fog I felt the first week went away and I feel like doing normal things (playing with the kids, laundry, grocery shopping) again. My aches and pains I used to feel are also gone. I almost worry this is to good to be true. I feel wonderful. I take 10 mg each day. Start with small dose and work up from that dose if you need to increase. High dose gave me anxiety. I hope this drug helps you as it has helped me, you aren't alone in the way you feel! Keep trying!

She told me about Sarafem.  I told her I didn't want to really take anti-depressants.  She told me about taking it for 14 days, before my cycle.  I've been taking it for over a year now and it has been a blessing.  I haven't experienced any negative side effects, except a lack of sex drive.  That could be due to communication problems in my marriage, but I noticed the lack of intrest in sex increased when I began Sarafem.  I read the reviews for Paxil CR and Zoloft, hoping to find another treatment for PMDD without the lack of interest in sex drive, but Sarafem has the most positive reviews.  I take 10mg of Fluoxetine HCL for 14 days each month and I'm very pleased with how I feel each month.  It has made me feel less anxious and generally content.  "
