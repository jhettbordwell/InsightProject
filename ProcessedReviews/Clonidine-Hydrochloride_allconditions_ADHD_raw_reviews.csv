56$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/14/2012 11:51:23 PM$Reviewer: vshayes, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $3$3$5$My son is 12 years old.  He is Autistic, ODD, ADHD and Bi-polar.  This medication was suppose to treat the impulsive rage that he has. It helped at first, but after the second week, it stopped working.  My doctor just decided to change drugs due to how intense my son's 'freak out' moments were getting.  The drug did work very well at first.  It was the first time in a long time that we went a FULL 2 days with NO drama!!! That was a welcomed blessing from above!

It did work on her hyperness..but mellowed her too much...also this medicine was very expensive when you are taking 2mg am and pm as prescribed. DD had upper respiratory infections, sore throats and legtharic proper dose.  
58$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$5/15/2012 4:12:52 PM$Reviewer: GMan, 45-54 Male  (Caregiver) $5$5$5$"My son is now 8.  Was diagnosed with ADHD 12 months ago and has taken Capvay from the start.  It has worked very well.  Takes 2 in the morning and 2 at dinner.  If we forget, usually at night, you can really tell the difference.  The first thing the next morning you now RIGHT AWAY if he missed. Wow!  We switched health plans and now they are charging us $350 avg for month for 120 pills.  I just looked at the reviews on Intuniv, NO WAY I will switch him to that, I'll pay the money and look for better insurance.  I highly recommend CapVay.  The only thing is that it can make him sleepy from time to time, but he used to wear out from the HD and crash all the time, so not really much difference there anyway."
59$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$3/30/2012 10:16:11 PM$Reviewer: garob, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$2$5$When my son started taking kapvay, it was great.  He had already been taking clonodine, so this was a nice long acting version that allowed me to give him much less Focalin (his other med).  However, after about two months, he developed a severe facial tick, pulling one side of his mouth back, had trouble focusing his eyes, and was pulling his eye back and blinking as well.  Fortunately, after taking him off of it, he is 98% better.  We were sorry we couldn't use it anymore, but be on the lookout for these symptoms.

For a while though I've noticed that depending on the day when it kicks in I will start sobbing uncontrollably. It doesn't happen every time and it generally stops on a dime. It's frustrating and upsetting and I'm not sure why this happens. 
I know folx on the spectrum can have more intense side effects/reactions to CNS medications and I'm wondering if that's related? I noticed a couple people have similar experiences with their kids. I'd love to know if anyone's had any luck managing that side effect or figuring out why it happens. 
It's especially frustrating because it works so well otherwise."

I would take .1mg in the evening before bed. I was constantly a zombie. I would sleep all night but not be able to stay awake during the day. I then was told to split the pill in half so was taking only .05mg before bed. Still was a complete zombie all day. 
I know people that have taken this with success for high blood pressure and childhood ADHD with success, but I was far from that."

He was first diagnosed with adhd and odd.  He was then misdiagnosed as bipolar because of his temper tantrums.  I have not seen any change in his taking clonidine twice a day for a month now, but the Zoloft,  Concerta and melatonin (for drowsiness at night) have been a huge help.  I just wish we started medicating before he turned 8 - it has been such a big improvement in his ability to socialize and obey.  He really needs medication for his brain to link discipline with his actions.

It worked wonders the first 2 weeks, she was clamer, she could sit still and pay attention. BUT it made her extermely tired to the point where she could barely speak without slurring. After the first 2 weeks the effects started to wear off and her Dr. reccomended we up the dosage to .25 3x daily so we did. She began having night terrors and sleepwaking and also started bruising easily from normal play. Her dosage is lowered back to .25 mg 2x daily now and she's sleeping regularly again but her behavior is not nearly as good as when it was 3x daily. Time will tell if this is really helping her.

It used to take a long time to get to sleep.  However, our bigger concern was him staying asleep through the night. He was waking up 4 or 5 times a night, scared, with bad dreams.  He has rarely  ever slept all night long. He has been on .1 mg, once at night.  We give it to him about an hour and a half before bed, and by bedtime, he is ready, and asleep in minutes. He still wakes up once or twice during the night, and he doesnt always know why he wakes up.  He has wet the bed on several occasions, and woke up soaked.  I do not want to give him a higher dosage, because I am not fully comfortable with this option.  He also just started Concerta 2 days ago, and has been on Zoloft for a few months.  We also have been working with Iron Suppliments, because his Ferotin levels were very low.  But, nothing is keeping him asleep through the night. I know this works getting him asleep,just not sure if we are heading in the right direction.  We have not seen any side effects.

We started using it to treat his adhd. As he got older he needed something stronger in the day time. We still use it at night to help him sleep. He is usually asleep in 30 - 60 minutes after taking it. It does not effect him during the day. I would be up all night waiting for him to go to sleep without it. We have had some weight issues but that is from the other adhd medications. He is on focalin xr in the day time now and is starting to put on some weight.

He has major problems at school and at home with being really hyper. He gets a ""bad"" note sent home from school everyday. He can't concentrate, can't be still at all, just extremely hyper. It would take him at least an hour to fall asleep at night. With his 1st dose last night he was asleep in 20 minutes. He woke up this morning a little tired but in a good mood. I have been so scared to medicate him but don't want him to struggle all his life if there are other options. If we all say prayers for each others children it can't hurt.

I tried scaling back the dose, but the tics came back.  It's tough to see him so pale and thin, but I want him to succeed in school, have friends and not always be in the Principal's office.  We tried everything else before resorting to meds.  I guess the benefits outweight the costs.  It's a tough choice, though.

My grandson who just turned 3 was diagnosed with many disabilities,one being a major behavioral issue. Because my sons ex does everything without consulting him (even though he has joint custody) she took my grandson to her physician and he prescribed this medication for him. Everything I have read says not to give to children under the age of 12. That concerns me. Also, my son refuses to give him this medication when he has him. I am worried after what I have been learning that his abrupt interruption of the medication will have an adverse reaction. I am very concerned for my grandson.

My son, 5 years old, was diagnosed as having ADHD. My ex-wife and I are divorced and live four hours away so it's hard to be involved on a daily basis. 

My son saw a psychiatrist who prescribed the Clonidine on an ""as needed"" basis at bedtime. I thought that's how my ex-wife was giving it to him but I later found out that she was giving it to him every day.

Anyhow, his new psychaitrist said that it's dangerous to miss a dose and that he needs this medication EVERY day. 

From what I've read, it seems like withdrawl from Clonidine is ONLY dangerous if you give it to someone (in this case my child) for a long period of time (more than 30 days). 

I guess what I'm asking/saying here is that if my son was presribed Clonidine on an ""as needed"" basis, there is no concern for withdrawl, correct?"
378$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$6/11/2009 2:59:48 PM$Reviewer: DeBar, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $4$4$5$"DMcCurdy1966 your comment was several months ago and I don't know if you check back at all but this might help someone else.
I am Bi-Polar 1 and I can tell you one thing from many doctors and YEARS of personal experience Bi-polar is not just random mood swings.  It is also random other conditions I have periods of ocd, add, adhd,and many many other things.  This is one of the many problems with bi-polar it really isn't always one disease it is often many at the same time or even may show almost nothing for periods of time (that's my experience as well as a lot of others that I have spoken to.) If your child or you are bi-polar, depending on how your cycles are you may end up changing meds on a regular basis as your body chemistry changes. I have had some great and horrible pill mixes(up to 10 at a time) but for the last few years I have settled on a mix that sort of works most of the time with adderal, ambien, and sometimes others on an ""as needed"" basis.  My point is work slowly with the pills, don't assume that because a pill does one thing good/bad today it will be the same effect later, either alone or in combination of other drugs.  
 I was actually prescribed this a few months ago for VERY high blood pressure and they took me off my adderal for obvious reasons.  Unfortunately I just didn't ""feel like"" going to the doctor to get more pills and up until this week I have been off them.  I am having the same symptoms as I did the last time  for roughly the first week. Severe headaches, insane cotton mouth and having trouble keeping my eyes open. the last one most likely has to do with the fact that I also ran out of my other pills a few days ago and I am getting used to them again.  I took .2 morning and night before but now am trying .1 twice a day.  At the time it didn't occur to me until I stopped taking it that it did help some with my current addhd because she adderal worked so well that I felt like this wasn't doing it, plus I assumed it the lower bp.

I am also a professional social worker.  This medication has worked wonders for my son.  He takes Adderall XR in the morning and Clonidine at night.  I take exception with grandparents who believe treating ADHD with medication is ""drugging kids.""  Would you not provide seizure medication to a child with epilepsy? People should not state ""do not give to kids.""  This is a decision that needs to be made between the parent and the treating physican.  That this medication may not work for some children does not naturally lead to the conclusion that it will not work for others or that medication for the treatment of ADHD should not be an option. "

My wife and I have taken him to 6 different doctors and phsyciatrists, with all of them saying he needs this drug or that drug.  My son is very aggressive at school and does not like to admit to doing wrong, especially when someone else does something.  Meaning he always has an excuse.  
He is currently on Concerta 72 mg. and clonidine 1/2 tablet for one more day and then goes to 1 full tablet.  I am hoping that this will help him get to sleep.  We have not had any of the nightmares as of yet, but I will repost if this occures when we increase his medicine.  "

Clonidine was just prescribed for my 2 1/2 year old son due to his extreme hyperactivity.  They stated they aren't sure whether he shows signs of ADHD or BI Polar.  
After reading all the posts regarding young children and the side effects.
I am choosing NOT to give this medication to my son and will deal with his hyperactivity until he is at the age to be properly checked for ADHD.
I didn't have my child till I was 39 and he was a premie at birth, after years of fertility drugs when I was younger and a new marriage, this is my miracle baby. 
I am not willing to take any un-necessary chances with his life.
THANKS FOR ALL THE WONDERFUL INPUT!
It helped my spouse and I make an informed choice regarding giving this to our son.

This diagnoses came after many doctor appointments and a few hospitalizations on Pediactric Phsyc wards. We tried homeopathic treatments and medical treatments.Things were not getting better. Our lives were a nightmare,my biggest fears that my son would end up taking his own life.
About a year ago, his new doctor perscribed Clonidine and Adderall (Adderall he had taken before with other meds).
The change in my son has been incredible. We have not had any major problems in the nine to ten months.
I believe the Clonidine has saved my sons life and mental health.
He has never complained about any side affects and like wise I have not seen anything that would worry me.

I was concerned that he may have some signs of ADD...not hyper, doc. prescribed .1 mgs to calm him. I am against drugging my child especially at a vulnerable and developing age! I feel parents need a second even third opinion before giving this to small children! My son has been taking this in quarter doses for two days now and he is very pale,lethargic,depressed,and low appetite. I check on him all night worried that this drug is too much for such a little body! I am making calls today and researching a ""non-medicated"" alterative! I hope you do the same if your a concerned parent as well! Follow your gut, if it doesn't feel right you need to find the answer until it does. I hope this helps!"

How did a doctor determine that your THREE YEAR OLD, had extreme ADHD? After going through four doctors I found one that sent my son for real testing for ADHD, the first three said ""Oh he's hyper, we'll put him on this"".We were told that children should be around 5 or 6 before being diagnosed. My son has TS, ADHD,OCD. He is on concerta in the morning and clonodine at night. It hasn't changed how funny and articulate he is but helps slow down the hyperactivity that even HE would say made him mad because he couldn't do things HE wanted to do. Children should only be on ADHD meds when appropriatley tested.Alot of doctors assume the parents are good to their children and that the child isn't being abused ect.. at home causing the ADHD like symptoms.Parents whose children actually have ADHD and chose to medicate should NEVER be viewed as lazy. We are far from it. We work our asses off,(sorry:), to make sure that the child is happy and occupied in a productive way. I have two other children and we have to make sure that each child gets equal treatment while trying to control the sugar,caffeine, and stimuls intake my son with ADHD ect.. gets. Most teachers I have encountered,even though my son's in a special ed inclusion class, think because my son can suppress alot of his Tourettes symptoms that they will be the one that will ""fix"" him. The life a family with a special needs child is one that wants to thrive with the disorders instead of surving in spite of them. Many children are misdiagnosed with ADHD but that only makes the stigma harder for the children, whom actually have it, to overcome. Take diagnosing serious, and make sure your doctor takes the appropriate steps to diagnose. Don't try to diagnose your child for this as a toddler, their attention and hyperactivity levels are usually high and differ from child to child. I didn't medicate my son until he was almost done with kindergarten,6 yrs old).Sorry for the novel:)"

The stimulant he takes to decrease impulsitivity keeps him awake at night.

At the end of first grade my son still couldn't pay enough attention to learn to read or write. After starting this medication, he's been able to get sleep (yay for me finally too) and can sit still in class and in just the last month has made huge progress learning to read. I hate drugging kids, but sometimes there are reasons beyond our control that the kids need it - this being one of them. He has responded well, with no known side effects. To me, this allows him to be who he really is and who he really wants to be.

he is very pail, with hardly any color
