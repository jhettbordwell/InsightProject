I have been on cymbalta for nearly 4 years now and it has made my life so much easier. My kids don't have to wonder why mom is sad or panicking anynore.

Felt nauseated with a fowl taste in my mouth. Could not sleep and had a headache. Upon reading more about the drug taking ibuprofen with it is not advisable. Also if you suffer from migraines it states that sumatriptan should not be taken with it either. I wish I would have read the reviews before taking this drug. After reading more about it I would I feel that my doctor should have not prescribed this to me. I only took one pill.
24$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/29/2018 2:32:31 PM$Reviewer: Cecilia S, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I am 5 weeks into taking this medication and noticed a significant difference within the first 2 days. I slipped and fell 9 months ago and  been dealing with a herniated disc, multiple annular tears, and a pats defect fracture everyday since. IÃ¢Â?Â?ve never been depressed in my life until about 6 months ago when I realized how long the recovery would be and how much ithe one fall turned my entire life upside down. I was crying daily (sometimes multiple times) and started havingsevere and uncontrollable anxiety everyday. I was also in chronic pain all through my spine and right side of my body. This medication Is literally saving me right now. My mood has improved and I have only had a few breakdowns (crying episodes), which have all been triggered by me seeing my now ex partner (he ended things with me a few months ago after many years). So - this medicine is great! Only side effects seem to be loss of appetite and also more prone to bruising (I have always been - but now is worse). No loss of sexual drive, no drowsiness, and no loss of focus or energy. My mind feels more clear than it has in a long time.

Works great.  Takes about 3 weeks before the benefits are fully realized but you can feel the difference within the first day.  Slight nausea and sweating sometimes, and it reduces the satisfaction/intensity of orgasms but has not reduced my libido since once you are generally feeling better, your libido should increase anyway.

She prescribed Duloxetine which I have taken for at least 8 years.  It has been the most effective medication to date. With the help of a clinical psychologist there are only 2 months per year that I consider low periods.  I will revisit my therapist before those months. I have been in and out of psychological therapy and psychiatric care for 20 years.  I would like to tell others to not give up or be satisfied with minimal quality of life. I worked with 3 other psychologists before I worked with my current one.  Only one of those psychologists was not a good match. The other two had to give up practicing for health reasons.  We moved to another city, but I am close enough to see the therapist I have worked with for about 10 years. I only see her when I need a fine tuning. I am currently looking for a new psychiatrist in the city where we live because my previous doctor retired.

53$Anxiousness associated with Depression$11/28/2015 10:58:43 PM$Reviewer: katep99, 13-18 Female  (Patient) $2$1$5$I switched from a different medication to duloxetine about six months ago. I had a terrible transition process and ended up in the emergency room due to the severe side effects. I have gone from 30 mg to 60 mg and tried light therapy, but I have never found real effectiveness from duloxetine. The negative effects outweigh any benefit.

Pdoc prescribed this for depression symptoms and pain relief. Been on it for 5 years. Once I ran out for one day and experienced the ""brain buzz"". I wanted to get off of it but Pdoc said no. When I finally do get off of this med, I know it will be a very slow process.  I wish she would have told me how intense the withdrawal symptoms can be- I would have asked for a different med. Now I feel helpless to this med. "

I also have chronic pain.  My pain doctor suggested doubling the dose for pain treatment, but I refused.  I currently take 60 mg. and he said the starting does for pain is 120mg.  I experience night sweats, ""foggy head"", low energy from the drug.  I once tried to decrease from 60mg to 40mg.  It was the worse 2 weeks of my life.  DO NOT START TAKING THIS DRUG. If you do, chances are you will never get off from it. I recently talked with a nurse who had to temporarily commit her husband when he tried to decrease his dose.    Surely everyone does not have the same experience, but a quick web search will show you that many people do.  "
144$Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/22/2019 3:44:09 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I've been on Cymbalta (generic) for approx a year now, yes I need to go back to my physician.  Initially it worked, but I believe it is because I didn't have the inordinate amount of stress I currently have.  I have had anxiety attacks, horrible panic attacks and a general overall depression.  60mg per day does diddly squat.  I attempted to wean myself off, big no no.  I had suicidal thoughts, horrific dreams and wanted to punch a kitten.  So back on them I went.  My physician put me on them because they worked well for her.  I think physicians really need to tailor psychotropic meds according to the person.  Don't immediately prescribe the new and latest or what they or their family are taking.  So, now that I lost my job and have no insurance I need to wait to see a doctor to get off these horrible meds.  Did I mention the dry mouth is horrendous?  I'm sure this works for some but is not for all.
149$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/11/2019 8:16:57 PM$Reviewer: Scotlandfog , 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$IÃ¢Â?Â?ve been prescribed Cymbalta since 2002 for Fibromyalgia but I found that it also helps greatly with my depression. That is until the generic brand came out and my insurance forced me to switch to it. I didnÃ¢Â?Â?t know what was wrong with me at first, I was irritable and then down right angry! After two weeks on it, I was constantly thinking of ways to kill my spouse! Then all of a sudden on day as I was semi rational I tried to figure out what changed. My spouse hadnÃ¢Â?Â?t! Then I realized it was the generic I was taking! I immediately called my doctor and told him how I was feeling and he of course said stop the generic and heÃ¢Â?Â?d prescribe the name brand Cymbalta again and write a letter to my insurance as why I needed to be on the name brand! After two weeks of taking Cymbalta again I felt like myself again! I take 60mg one time daily now. I used to be on 60mg twice a day but it destroyed my libido! So it was lowered. My Fibromyalgia makes me hurt of course but the Cymbalta helps a great deal. And although I have some down days theyÃ¢Â?Â?re more situational than chronic depression. I donÃ¢Â?Â?t ever plan on stopping Cymbalta because it has helped me so greatly! As long as itÃ¢Â?Â?s the name brand.

Diagnosed with Type 2 Bipolar/GAD 20 years ago more more recently, Fibromyalgia and panic disorder. Cymbalta, for me, is the type of medicine that you don't notice actually working until you have to stop taking it.  There have been a few hiccups with refills that has left me to going without for a week or two (I know you shouldn't quit cold turkey - I would try to space out what little I had left to avoid issues.) It didn't even click in my head why the muscle/joint pain returned, why I was back to crying, why I panicked every time I walked in a crowded store until I received my refill and was able to ease back on and everything was back to being at least manageable.  I totally understand that this medication doesn't work for everyone and people experience different reactions but for me, the benefits completely outweigh the temporary (but mild) side effects. I had to give this plenty of time to work but it really does make life a bit easier.
162$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/7/2019 3:47:57 PM$Reviewer: Linda, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I was prescribed this after an attempt on my life. I've been taking 90 dose daily. It gives me horrible sweats, vivid dreams, constant yawning & lock jaw, it wears off in the evening and makes me extremely irritable and aggressive and finally it also did not prevent my manic/anxiety episodes from happening. Although I wasn't as depressed on it, it didn't help with my anxiety or manic behavior. 
166$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/14/2018 2:50:47 PM$Reviewer: DaisyD, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Taken for dysthymia, a mild form of chronic depression.

Will talk to my PCP about another antidepressant at my next appt Jan 2.

Incredible improvement in anxiety and depression, very seldom have either now.  30 was good but 60 is better.  Take 30 at 8 am and noon to avoid sleeping issues.  Side effects at first (dry mouth, insomnia, decreased libido) but all decreased or went away entirely after a few weeks.  Advise to eat healthy diet and limit caffeine and alcohol, your side effects will be minimum.  Sorry that this drug doesn't help everyone, for me it's been dramatic change for the better.

Ruined my life and my studies. Have passed out countless times, one of the last lost me my education because I didn't know why I had a syncople episode. So thanks so much after all the money I spent thinking it was helping me, but honestly saw no changes. Should have stopped taking it, but NO! You can't just stop taking it! I have every adverse reactions to this med listed. Am I the stupid one or are the creators of this ""great medication"" or just a bunch of assholes that got it on the market and used people. You can go to hell. You knew the major symptoms and yet I suffered way too long on it. Hope your mansions are beautiful, we can barely pay our mortgage. Thanks for absolutely nothing. "

I feel better than I have ever felt. Taking it with Wellbutrin and trazadone. I hope I never get some of the bad side effects, but if I do I will still be thankful for the life it has given me now. So sorry to hear that it doesn't work for everyone.

It wasnâ??t making any difference and then I experienced the formerly unknown horror of brain zaps. At times I felt like I was floating just off the mattress! Iâ??ve always been physically healthy so this was far worse and scarier than any mental â??challengeâ? I was having. Then I tried to quit. Nightmare thatâ??s a blur now of several days, little sleep, and feelings I can only describe as messed up. Thankfully, I found someoneâ??s review online that described how to ween off of it successfully. Each dose, you remove 3 more beads than previously removed from the capsule. It worked and Iâ??ll never view Rx drugs the same. Unless youâ??re facing the alternative of a life of hell without any other hope, stay away from Cymbalta, is my strong advice. If you take it, understand that it will own you and new problems you never imagined when become your norm. Can you tell I feel lucky to have found a way off? By the way, turned out I had developed Complex PTSD from my experiences and was ultimately helped only by EMDR after 7 years of seeking help from expensive psychiatrists and psychologists with no noticeable change. Highly recommend it though totally surprised it actually worked. I have a functional life now, off of Social Security Disability finally, and working full time for a year now with bonuses from my performance after being unable to hold a job for the first time in my life over 9 years.prior to now. Really want to be able to help others who are where I was.

He died alone at home at age 23, after the specialist ignorantly increased his dosage.  Since he was heat sensitive after suffering heat stroke 18month earlier, as divulges to the ""doctor"", he should NEVER have been using CYMBALTA/DULOXETINE.  "
211$Anxiousness associated with Depression$11/3/2017 1:59:18 PM$Reviewer: Cymbalta issue, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I began Cymbalta and approx. 4 weeks in I began having diarrhea.  I thought it was a virus and waited 10 days and then went to my doctor.  I discussed with her the only change that I had was the Cymbalta.  She didn't think that it was the cause and so I remained on the drug.  2 weeks later I still had the diarrhea so I was referred to a gastroenterologist.  They did a colonoscopy and said it initially looked healthy.  A week or so later they called me and told me that I had Lymphocytic Colitis.  One of the first things she said to me was that she noticed I was on Cymbalta.  I told her say nothing more because I was already in the middle of weaning myself off because I felt like it had to be the issue.  She said yes they have found that it can cause this. So you think ok problem solved, but Lymphocytic Colitis cannot be cured.  I am now under control but only because I take Budesonide 3mg daily.  It was a miserable existence without it, and don't say why don't you try gluten free, or no dairy... I have tried it all.  My 2nd opinion Gastroenterologist said, our patients with this have also tried everything, just take the pill. Why in an otherwise healthy person, exercise regularly eat healthy would it do this... I don't know but I am obviously not the only one!

It did help somewhat with my depression, but not as well 4 anxiety. Was also told it helps with fybromyalgia, but not much for me. Still had to b on Valium and an antihistamine for my anxiety. I began having terrible side affects of sweating uncontrollably, flashes of light and trails of lights, elevated heartbeat, turning bright red, nightmares and complete exhaustion. In bed for days at a time. I thought I was feeling well enough  to come off the medicine, with my doctor's ok,that was in April 2016. Thought i was going crazy when I started skipping days to cut back on it. Finally figured out I had to open the capsules and count the small little pellets until I was down to only about 10 pellets, then stopped completely end of May 2017. In this last month if no Cymbalta I still have the withdrawal symptoms 4-5 days a week. PLEASE be careful coming off if this medication as it causes many to have worse suicidal tendencies. Suicide has happened many times from this medication. Not all doctors know about these problems, BE CAREFUL!!!

If I tried to stay awake I would twitch drop things like a cup of coffee or cigarette would go flying.  I was completely dysfunctional the doctor drops my morphine level and increases Cymbalta it does nothing for my pain but once I stopped I got normal REM sleep again and feel much better.

This medication had me literally climbing the walls! Its primary effect is to increase Norepenephrine (Noradrenaline) and Serotonin by inhibiting reuptake.

Easily the most horrendous and frightening experience ever and FAR worse than no treatment at all.  This is the stuff of nightmares and I would not wish it on my worst enemy.  If you use it, use the LOWEST possible dose, for the least length of time, and be prepared for debilitating detox-ing that makes opiate detox seem like a pleasure.  This should be the last ditch choice after all else has failed and even then you may be better off not taking it at all.

I was on this medication for two months and loved how it was helping me but I had to stop taking it because it made me toss and turn all night long. Even though I couldn't sleep at night I had no problem accidently falling asleep on the couch everyday. 
284$Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/23/2016 8:33:20 PM$Reviewer: MissV, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Had highest hopes that I would be one of the lucky ones for whom this drug worked. Within the 1st 24 hours I had a HORRIBLE headache, my stomach hurt, and I couldn't eat. By the 3rd dose I was also having hideous night sweats and was dizzy to nearly passing out. Was so sleepy and felt so crappy each of the 3 days that I took a dose I had to stay in bed or the day. My dose was only 20mg! Tonight is day 4, but I've decided to stop. I pray I don't suffer withdrawal. 3 days shouldn't be enough to cause withdrawal on stopping, but then, 20mg shouldn't have turned my world upside down either. A year ago I went thru w/d from Pristiq when my ins wouldn't pay for my prescribed dosage. It took me almost 9 months and was the worst hell I've ever been through. I swore I'd never put myself thru that again, yet here I am desperate for a magic pill to make my life livable to the point where my last 3 days have been spent asleep and miserable from trying this drug. I should also mention I took generic, as that's what the Blue Cross bosses think is best and won't pay for name brand.

323$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/3/2015 9:08:12 PM$Reviewer: Sheldonoff, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I am not a doctor.  I am a sick old man. I have been taking Cymbalta 30 mg for several years as a component of my daily medication cocktail. It is virtually impossible to determine or rate the effectiveness of a drug like this when you are taking eight to ten (or more) other medications which deal with contiguous medical conditions.  The side effects of every drug cross the side effects of another drug being prescribed to a patient by a different doctor for a different medical condition.  Sounds confusing and it is.  However, with respect to Cymbalta, I will say this.  When I first began taking the drug, I noticed a definite improvement in my pertinent symptoms.  I have been taking it for several years now at a low dosage and I have continued to notice its effectiveness with no negative side effects.  In short, it has continued to work for me, and in this sense I endorse it.  However, I consider myself lucky because medications such as Cymbalta are prescribed by many doctors who are not sufficiently checking the side effects of parenthetic drugs which his or her patients take. This is particularly the case when some of those medications in a patient's chart have been prescribed by other doctors for other medical conditions.  I suspect that even routine  pharmacology  can be a very dangerous crap game when it is played by too many doctors who have forgotten some of the basic clinical skills they learned in med school.    
335$Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/4/2015 5:58:13 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$1$4$I was prescribed Cymbalta about 2.5years due to some depression and anxiety associated with some major life changes. I started taking it and over time I became very numb to everything. Feelings, emotions, physical feelings and moods. I was not affected by anything and didn't experience happiness, sadness or any sort of emotion despite events that would occur that should cause these emotions, naturally, in any human. I decided this wasn't how I wanted to live, so I tried to come off the Cymbalta on my own. It was the worst experience I have ever had. The withdrawal symptoms are that of a street drug addict and can cause suicidal thoughts, brain zaps, body aches, sweating and severe vomiting. Finally, I was able to locate a doctor that specialized in medicine management. I had to get on Prozac to offset the severe withdrawal symptoms of the Cymbalta and had to ween off of it by reducing the mg. The damage this drug has caused to my health, my mental stability and the after effects of being off it have been life altering. I would never suggest this drug to anyone and would highly warn that should you, or someone you know, start on this medication, that you are under careful and cautious doctor care. This medication ruined my life and after being off of it for about 4 months now, I am still dealing with the consequences.

I had serious, awful anxiety that felt completely out of my control. I did therapy for 6 months with no change before being sent to a psychiatrist. The first few days were hard as I felt irritable for seemingly no reason. About the first week in I felt like ""not myself"" although I couldn't explain past that. I just felt... weird. 2 weeks in I realized I didn't feel like myself because I wasn't anxious and my mind was finally free to think about other things. It's been a year later and my anxiety is still very low. Rarely, I have times where I feel anxious still but it's nothing like it was before: hours and hours each day thinking anxious thoughts that I couldn't stop, countless times crying over nothing, asking my family for reassurance daily, etc. No more. I feel like a completely different person now. "

The two week 'wait it out, your anxiety will get better after it gets worse' period never goes away. Stay far away from this drug if you have GAD.

491$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/27/2014 1:04:21 AM$Reviewer: lassale, 55-64 Male  (Patient) $5$5$5$60 year old male. Since childhood have always had anxiety problems. Because of this, I have felt chest pressure most days of my life which is very annoying. Although my life is truly blessed and wonderful the anxiety has steadily gotten worse and depression has joined it. Have tried just about every antidepressant and anxiety med. Cymbalta at 90 mg (even the generic) works very well for me. It does have in my case strong sexual side effects including lack of interest and performance, but other than that, I think it is a wonderful drug. I tried going off Cymbalta twice. I could not succeed. So my feeling is I will probably be on it forever unless something better comes along. It fully eliminates the anxiety and reverses the depression. The chest pressure goes away after about 2 weeks on Cymbalta but it does take a good 8 weeks to experience its full effect. I feel the generic is a bit weaker than brand, but at the 90 mg, it is fine. Good luck!

I started it because of anxiety I was feeling due to a number of life changes happening all at once. The only long term side effects I experienced after my body became used to it were increased sweating and feeling hot. If I missed a dose, I would feel ""electric zaps"" in my arms and hands that would subside when I took the next dose. However, after 5 years I started gradually tapering my dose because I wanted to be off of it and had HORRIBLE withdrawal effects with each small decrease - dizziness, nausea, shakiness, restless legs, pounding headache upon standing, depression, crying spells, irritablilty and agitation, and panic attacks. It has taken me over a year and I am still not completely off. When I originally tried to stop taking it after I stabalized on 20 mg, which is the smallest dose available, the effects were so bad after 48 hours that I could not even stand up and walk, let alone drive my car to work. I have had to resort to opening the 20 mg capsules (with my doctor's approval) and removing more and more beads inside. Looking back, I would have rather suffered through the anxiety I was feeling 5 years ago than started this drug. It would have been worth it to me only if I wanted to be on it forever. "

A way to handle the cost is to utilize the Cymblata web site for % off. Also I had taken the 60MG and that was way to much and noticed a big difference in the way I felt.

785$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/8/2013 10:15:01 PM$Reviewer: Jon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$4$I have a history of depression, for which my psychiatrist has prescribed taking an antidepressant on a more or less permanent basis.  But my real reason for wanting to take Cymbalta is to prevent anxiety.  I think it's the best one I've taken.  I don't get any generalized/concurrent nervousness/anxiety with it, and I don't get any moments of panic either.  I just feel comfortable most of the time.  The downside I have with the drug concerns my sleeping.  If I slept well the night before, I get severe insomnia the next night and just want to stay up and enjoy activities all night.  So I am taking Trazodone for sleep at night, which helps.  But the Cymbalta also causes sleepiness during the day regardless of whether I did or didn't sleep well the night before and regardless of whether I took the Trazodone (it's definitely the Cymbalta causing it.)  So for that, I drink a lot of caffeinated drinks like tea during the day.  Thankfully, the caffeine doesn't negate the antianxiety effects of the Cymbalta for me.  I admit I don't have my sleep perfectly worked out, but with Cymbalta I don't feel worried or apprehensive about anything.

It doesn't help any of the pain I experience. I had a severe panic attack and was suffering from derealization and, so, I was prescribed this. It took a year, or more, for the after effects of the panic attack to wear away and that happened, I think, on its own, not because of the drugs I was prescribed. The most annoying and disturbing side effects from Cymbalta are horrifying dreams. Every night I dread going to bed because my dreams are so stressful. It's like having a Tom Cruise mega-action flick going off in my head every night. I think the psychoactive drugs I'm taking, which includes Trazodone, have wrecked my sleep patterns. I've just been diagnosed with sleep apnea.

Prior to being put on a 30mg dose for 30 days, I could not sleep, eat, or go about my daily tasks without excessive panic attacks, heart burn, and fear.  Within the first few days of taking the 30mg dose, I felt more capable of life again, though still had moments of complete fear.  My doctor increased my dose to 60mg, which I have been taking since June.  Though I still have moments of anxiousness, I am able to think rationally and quickly dismiss the thought.
Some side effects are that are annoying (but tollerable) I have experienced are as follows:
Abnormal dreams--This was one of the first side effects I experienced.  I still get them when I am running low on sleep, but I accept them--it is better than sleepless nights!
Excessive Sweating--This happens at night, never during the day.  I will take up with completely soaked pajamas, but not feel warm.  It gets annoying, but again, I manage.
Weight gain--This is in conjunction with a birth control I am taking, but I have gained approximately 5lbs. above my normal weight since starting Cymbalta.  It's not a huge difference, but I prefer the relief over the weight issue, for sure!

Cymbalta is incredibly expensive, even with insurance.  For this reason, I'm counting down the days until I can wean off of it.  This impacted my satisfaction score--holy moly!"

Supposedly, it would do so much for me: relieve my anxieties, ease my osteoarthritis pain, blah, blah, blah..... I think the panic attack wore away by itself and the crap has never done anything at all for my physical pain. I have really, really ugly dreams that should be nightmares because there's a lot of anxiety and horror in them, but the tension is never resolved. I'm hooked on the goddam, lousy shit and no one will help me help me get off it. I was also declared ""depressed"" and ""bipolar"" at the time I was given Cymbalta and also prescribed Lithium and Trazadone. I kicked the Lithium, but I'm having trouble getting off Trazadone. I'm SO angry!!! I wasn't depressed when I went in for treatment and I'm NOT bipolar. I was sitting on the edge of mu chair, trembling, when I was first examined and put on these drugs, insisting that I just terrified and still they did this to me. Once when I, unfortunately, went without Cymbalta for three I became suicidal even tho' I knew it was just the drug talking.  "

While it did alleviate my symptoms of anxiety, the side effects were difficult at first. It took 6 weeks to get past the side effects. My insurance does not cover the medication, which I was already taking for a month when I learned that. The cost is prohibitive; at $200 a month. I started having other side effects while taking the medication; including fatigue. I decided for me it was time to stop; however, with just one missed pill; the horrendous symptoms of withdrawl began. I am nauseated; having episodes of diareah; and the worst part is this constant feeling of being in a fog, my brain quite literally feels like a flashing neon sign. I am having difficulty functioning, especially if the room is busy. I am sensitive to noise; and changes in position. I have young children; and life is difficult right now. I wish I had known that withdrawl was a real problem on this drug. I would never have started this medication. "

restless leg syndrom, no sleep. The only thing that helped was bendryl. It helped with the legs and the sleep.
it took 6 weeks . I went through a period of terribly sore feet for no reason.
I now am taking rytlin and I am amazed. Problems fixed in two hours. I am so happy. It took 56 years to get the right doctor to figure me out.

Cymbalta has been helpful.  Unfortunately, I have gained 17lbs in two months.  That is a huge weight gain for me.  My cholesterol has also increased.  I am genetically predisposed to have low cholesterol and to be thin.  The weight gain and increase in cholesterol are very worrisome.  I am a pelvic mesh victim so turning off the sex drive is a blessing, for now.  I only take 20 mlg /day (a pediatric dose).  I hope I will only need the drug for 6 months.  I hope the weight gain will go away when I quit taking it.  I also hope the cholesterol will go back down when I quit taking it.  It is really sad when you need the drug to ease your anxiety because you need to have a god-awful surgery, yet it harms you in other ways. I couldn't face the surgery without Cymbalta and the surgery is ulitmately supposed to make things better.   To sum it up, the Cymbalta has really helped me cope.  For that I am thankful.

After a couple of days, I started shaking and my anxiety and panic attacks started getting worse.  She then put me on Prozac and that worked for about 10 days and then I had a really bad reaction.  I couldn't sleep; would pace the floor all night and day; started hallucinating and felt like I was going crazy; the end was the day I felt suicidal; I stopped and went back to my doctor.  She then tried Cymbalta (30 mg) and within a week I almost felt like my old self! We then increased dosage to 60 mg. and I am still on it.  It has made all the difference! I can now function again and haven't had a panic attack in almost three months.  Episodes of anxiety have also decreased greatly and everyone who knows me says I am my old self again.  I was in danger of losing my job, my sanity, and my life until I started taking Cymbalta.  It does take several weeks for it to really work well, but I have nothing but good things to say about it. It's not for everyone, but for me it is working great and I am very satisfied with it.

Before I began taking it (approximately 4 years ago), I had a doctor who had me on 3 benzodiazapines for anxiety all at once...I decided enough was enough! I wasn't living my life, I was void of emotion. I decided to detox from the benzos. I went to a different doctor and was started on Cymbalta for my anxiety and depression. It was rough at first. I was nauseated and felt sick, but I I started taking it in the morning with protein, and the nausea and headaches stopped. The Cymbalta has decreased my panic /anxiety attacks far more than Xanax or Ativan ever did.  For the first time in a long time, I realized, that it's actually good to feel bad sometimes, because you're actually ""feeling.""  
My husband and I are thinking about starting a family, and I'm a little nervous to stay on Cymbalta during pregnancy, but we'll see if the benefit outweighs the risk.

Today, I feel dizzy and disoriented. I've been throwing up all day. I've never been suicidal or had suicidal thoughts, but last night I kept thinking about what it would be like to shoot myself. I wasn't wanting to do it, but was just thinking about it. I'm calling the doc today. I don't want Xanax for my anxiety - it's too addicting. I just want to feel normal again.

As for OCD- there was a slight diminishment in OCD symptoms but basically cymbalta just made me feel numb, dazed and like sleeping all the time.  It's recommended for depression but I don't know how effective it is for that because I actually felt a numb, dazed, depression on it.  I felt so tired I could barely do the daily essentials.  AND...THERE REALLY SHOULD BE A WARNING ABOUT WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS....EVEN AFTER TAPERING OFF SLOWLY I'M HAVING A HORRIBLE TIME....haven't slept in weeks and when I do fall asleep for a few hours in the early morning end up having horrible nightmares and start screaming, my husband has to wake me up just to get me out of the nightmare, experiencing terrible irritability almost bordering on rage and I'm not a hostile person by nature so it's very frightening - it feels like you're going crazy...horrible restless leg feeling, feel like crying all the time, feel like I can't breath, terrible headaches, dizziness and lightheaded, twitching eyes, feel exhausted and restless at the same time.  IT SHOULD BE IMPERATIVE FOR THE COMPANIES THAT PUT OUT THESE DRUGS TO INCLUDE A WARNING AND ALSO SUGGESTIONS SUCH AS SUPPLEMENTS AND MAYBE A MILD SEDATIVE TO HELP WITH WITHDRAWAL.  I will call Eli Lilly to report my experience.  I had been on effexor and clonazapam before that for 2 years, had some withdrawal but nothing this severe - the clonazapam may have actually helped with effexor withdrawal but my practitioners did not want to give me clonazapam this time because they claim it's addictive....didn't have severe withdrawal from clonazapam, looks like cymbalta appears to be more the addictive withdrawal experience.  There must be a better answer to depression/anxiety disorders.  From much of my research I'm discovering that the thyroid, adrenals and our whole endocrine system can have a major effect on the functioning of the brain.  Pray that MD's recognize this!

It also took care of the pain I feel with some nerve damage I have. You really cannot drink alcohol with this. I had a couple of drinks one night, and became extremely sick.

Finding a hobby (yard work or something physical- releases something, sleeping more, and watching my diet helped alot more.  I felt weak taking a pill to solve my problems. While taking it, I had a constant low grade headache, It did nothing for depression, made me aggressive and easily agitated.  Other benefits included easier breathing, less joint and back pain, easily controlled with aspirin.  I did start to sweat more than usual, urination was less too. I have an active job so weight gain was not an issue.  My doctor provided me with samples, I guess the prescription is expensive, so I am looking into the B vitamins and niacin to relieve some of the depression, for anxiety a little caffiene pill or coffee at the start of the day helps, for sleep depending on how much is needed, Melatonin helps- be careful or you'll end up with a caffiene withdrawl and melatonin can give you a zombie feel too, like cymbalta. As for the action in the bedroom, it's better for the female, stay erect, with delayed climax for men, all the time in the world for women.  I tried Lexapro and Paxil- could not multitask, made me feel worse, I love to multitask, driving became a joke If you can't multitask you cannot drive- try it. I've been off if two weeks, I feel like the film of a hard boiled egg is peeling away exposing reality-  Headaches remain with slight vertigo. I look forward to changing my sleep patterns to get enough REM sleep so I can dream again, for now the new dreams are extreme, but interesting, if you can't dream, what fun is sleeping? Try reading ""Healing yourself Naturally"" by Michael Savage- using everyday foods that we no longer cook or eat (more healthy) most of our poor diets and low phisical activity are the main reasons we have this epidemic of depression and anxiety. Shift work and light sensory deficits are another.  I think i just  cured myself.  Good luck, prayer helps too."

Can funtion well, no energy or feeling full of excitement(happy).  Can function ok in the bedroom,erect-but no climax,  better for women on the other end- longer together time. Body pains seem less, urinate less it seems. I quit using it cold turkey- one week no problems, more dreams at bedtime, weird, kind of scary.  feel dizzy at times, like when you blow up balloons. Sleeping seems better,now that I'm off it I work nights and took the pill daily at 6 am.  Tried lexapro, and paxil, could not drive.  On cymbalta, I could not multitask, I hoping that comes back.

I was prescribed Cynbalta approx 7/8 wks ago. It initially left me in a more calm state but I suddenly began to take most of the side effects of this drug i.e., nausea, trembling, panic attacks etc. I would urge anyone who is prescribed this drug to carefully look at the side effects because if you are prone to any of them, then you are more than likely to develop some or most of them. My doctor actually advised me not to read the side effects which in retrospect was the wrong advice. I would advise anyone to read the side effects of any prescription drug. I am weaning myself off Cymbalta at the moment but still suffering from its effects - however, I am pleased with my decision to come off it. I shall deal with my depression in my own way now, probably through herbal remedies. I read one review which said ""this is the drug from hell"". I don't believe I would be so graphic but the person making the comment had been on this for several months and I truly wish her well in her recovery. One piece of advise I would offer to anyone is that if you have a decent and understanding partner then you can talk things through with their help. That's what I'm grateful for and I  will not go back on anti depressants. It's too easy for doctors to dole out this medication to an unsuspecting and trustworthy public domain. I hope my review has been a help to you."

Been on 30mg for about 6 weeks and decided to stop.  The vivid dreams are intollerable.  Feel like I live all night instead of rest.  After reading reviews online about getting off these meds after a long period of time, I decided not to have to go through that as it seems these meds make you more dependent on them.  It does help my depression, but my short term memory went good bye!!  I have recently lost 125 lbs and gained weight already as well as my sugar cravings are at a peak and I am diabetic so that is a no no for me.  I will have to self battle the depression with attitude versus these drugs out there for it.  Maybe even get on valume if need be for aniexty when needed.  I can see this medication helping for severe depression, but I cannot see the benefits for menapause induced depression.  I am only 41 and had to have an emergency hysterctomy 2 years ago.  I have balanced my depletion of hormones with quarterly bloodwork and vitamins with no artifical hormones as the history in my family with breast lumps.  Cymbalta is a good med, just not for me.  Before you start any type of the med, I would be leary of its' dependency on it as you cannot stop cold turkey.  I have after 6 weeks and I am sure I will feel it in the next few days.

Took about a week to feel the affects of the meds. After that, my mood has been great, no more bouts of severe anxiety, and it actually improved my overall mood in life(maybe I had a little depression too). The side effects are mild, initially(first three days) the side effects were horrible..drowiness, nausea, dissiness, but after that only minor ones...I seem to have either really weird dreams or really vivid ones(no sleepwalking though). No dimished sex drive, actually it has helped my sex drive, it some how allows me to last longer in bed. Now, I have gained about 20lbs on the medication, but with my anxiety I lost alot of weight, so the weight gain was an addded benefit to me, I actually look healthy. Other than that, no other problems to speak of except when I forget to take it, the symptoms tend to come back like when I first started taking it. Hope this review helps....

After 6 years of being on 20mg of Lexapro, the drug started to wear off. I was starting to feel on edge, angry, panicky, and downright tired. I was sweating all of the time, nauseated, and it felt like I was having irregular heart beats. I've also had 13 surgeries on my right leg and the pain had started to make me feel like I was insane. So, the doc switched me to Cymbalta. I'm on week 2, day 2 at 60mg and feel slightly better. It addressed some of the pain in my leg, so far. My anxiety is starting to calm down a little bit, so I'm hoping within a few more weeks I will start to feel like me, again. I was nauseated for the 1st 2 days, however it wasn't too bad. I find taking it with a little food or milk helps. Like any drug, it may take a few weeks to fully kick in, so none of the other side effects have consumed me. I still feel a bit shaky and anxious, however I'm only on day 2, week 2 with an increased dose. I am praying this works.. I've been on Prozac, Lexapro, and a form of fluxotene (spelling?) and eventually, those wore off. Hoping Cymbalta will do the trick... So far, it's not that bad...

Cymbalta was prescribed to relieve anxiety. What I found was an immediate relief from irritability that I hadn't been aware I was experiencing. Relief from the irritability is what I like most about Cymbalta. I find that the discontinuation symptoms are comparable to Effexor XR except it takes much less time to experience them. From experience I have learned that it is important to be compliant about taking the medication as prescribed. Missing 1 day can bring on the brain ""zaps"" and a general unwell feeling. I also experience unsettling dreams if I miss doses. I take 60 mg a day. That seems to be a good therapeutic dose for me. The downfall is the ravenous appetite that others have experienced as well as feelings of weakness Eating does not relieve the hunger or the weakness, but seems like the only logical thing to do to relieve the symptoms. As a result I have gained 5 pounds in a short time and if I continue on this track I will continue to gain weight. This is my biggest concern since I am normally fit, thin and strong and currently feel exactly the opposite of that. It's a trade off feeling mentally good, but physically not so much. Not sure what to do about it. All SSRIs and SNRIs cause those symptoms for me."

I find it takes the edget off anxiety/depression, but doesn't eliminate it.  I often need to take a Klonopin to 'settle down' my physical symptioms.  I'm also feeling lately like I'm not really experiencing much emotion, sort of a semi-catatonia, with more sadness than I'm used to.  I'd like to try to get off the drug, but if I fall back into a disabling spate of anxiety it could mean 1-3 months of not working.

I had been suffering from PTSD for almost 14 years and never knew what I was going through until I decided to do some research for myself which eventually led me to see a psychiatrist.  They say that it takes about 4 weeks for the medicine to get into your system before it starts to work, but I felt results within the first few days - certainly by the first week - of taking Cymbalta.  I felt normal again.  Maybe it worked so fast for me because I wasn't suffering from depression as a lot of other users were.  I started on 30mg and moved up to 60mg within a week.  The only side effects I had from the 60mg was extreme sleepiness (a lot of yawning) and I was unable to obtain an orgasm.  I went back down to 30mg, still some sleepiness although not as much, and I am able to achieve an orgasm.  Unfortunately the sensitivity I used to get from my nipples is no longer there.  They aren't numb or anything, I just don't get aroused anymore when they are touched (sorry if that's TMI, but I just want to let people know what may or may not happen to them while taking Cymbalta).  I'm going down to 20mg in a few days and I pray that the sensual feeling I used to get from my nipples being touched will return.  Oh yeah, I even skip a day sometimes and no terrible side effects.

I went off it about 8 months ago and now am back on due to current situation. I simply function better with meds. I want to tell everyone that Cymbalta is no worse going through withdrawl than other meds. It's scary if you don't understand it but it's a normal withdrawl process and something that lasts a few weeks. Symptoms are the same as when you start the med. It's just your body adjusting. If you're new to antidepressants, the whole thing can be a scary experience but a lot has to do with your perception and expectations. If you're apprehensive and looking for symptoms, you'll feel all of them. None of the withdrawl effects are that horrible compared to any other antideppressant. Paxil I heard is the worst. For me, the benefits far outweighed the negative side affects.

I almost always have trouble sleeping and wake up to a jolt-like feeling during the night and in the morning.It freaks me out and it really seems to hit more often when I am sleeping and/or relaxed. I have VERY strange and vivid dreams and frequent nightmares. I used to love to walk and excercise but not very often since starting this med.

He was initially put on it for depression, anxiety and chronic back pain. It made him lathargic, and the pain increased and spread toother parts of his body. Now that we are trying to wan him off, the withdrawals are horrible! The suffering this man has had to endure is inhumane at the least. I don't believe the doctors were properly educated on this terrible drug so in turn patients aren't able to make a clear educated decision as to take this medication to begin with. I have placed a complaint with th FDA as well as with Eli Lilly. I have also placed a complaint with his doctor. I am so angry and to know that the weaning process will takes months is just unacceptable to me. Get online and type in Cymbalta withdrawal and Cymbalta side efffects and see the other hundreds of people who are suffering with little to no help from the medical field. Also, you will see the desperate attempts of some who are trying to get off this drug. There WILL be a death as a result of some of these tactics and I forsee a class action law suit in he future for Eli Lilly and any of the medical professionals who refuse to hear the cries of so many desperate people.

2667$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/25/2009 11:37:57 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$4$"I have tried several antidepressants over the years (Paxil CR, Lexapro, Wellbutrin) for my depression and anxiety, but I have not been satisfied with any of them for various reasons.  I thought I had found a great one when I started taking Cymbalta back in February.  Sure, the adjustment period wasn't great (but I did lose some weight from the loss of appetite!), but my mood seemed better and all that.  I increased from 30 mg up to 60 about 3 mos later.  Then starting in about June, I noticed my terrible insomnia and lack of energy.  I have gained weight, causing me great distress, because I have no energy to work out and no food is completely satisfying so I eat more.  It finally occurred to me last week that it could be the Cymbalta so I stopped taking it cold turkey.  Immediately, my sleep improved, I have happier dreams, and I feel more energetic during the day.  My only problem now is suffering through this wretched withdrawal.  I feel hungry, but I can't keep any food down, and the vertigo and ""brain zaps"" are awful.  I have never had withdrawal from any Rx like this.  I hate feeling sick, but I know I need to get through it to be happy again.  I am in a stable emotional situation now, so I feel like I can live without any medication once I get my energy back.  I only wish I had made the connection earlier."

I am increasingly dissatisfied by this side effect and have now started exploring/researching other options.
I took Lexapro in the past with minimal success in alleviation of anxiety/depression but no weight gain.  I tried Welbutrin but it made me feel really angry/aggressive.

I asked my Dr. if there were any major side effects and was told there should not be much.  I had no trouble getting on it, I had been on lexapro for a year prior so this may have helped.  It seemed to be doing the trick with might night attacks.  I was so glad to be sleeping through the night I didn't care that I would fall asleep as soon as I sat down at night & did not want to get up in the morning.  Then before I knew it I had gained 40lbs and had starting sweating all the time.  I asked the Dr. but this was not a side effect.  So now I'm trying to get off of it.  The side effects I'm having now are aweful. I'm feel dizzy, nausa, brain zaps, crying, mood swings.  I'm on 60mg and tried to take every other day, but the withdrawals started anyway.  So I've gone cold turkcy.  Not sure this is the way to go.  I will do a lot more reseach before I start taking another drug.  Even if the Doctor says it doesn't have bad side effects.

I also constantly felt bloated, sweat frequently, and had an increased heart rate very easily.  It made me feel as if I was extremely out of shape.

The downside is from the moment I started taking it my appetite went to zero, all food cravings disapped, sex drive decreased; and received orgasm disfuction in return. Motivation to do anything physical nearly disappeared. Before Cymbalta I was a regular gym rat going to the gym a minimum of four times a week. With a decrease in appetite and eating very little, I am still trying to figure out why I gained 10 pounds. 

My Dr wanted me to go from 60 mg to 90 mg because its effectiveness was wearing off. Two days after going to 90 mg I started having horrible stomach pain. Awoke every morning with nausea, could only eat very little throughout the day. I have taken myself from 90 mg to 60 mg to 30 mg to 30 mg every other day. I have now completely stopped. My head is swimming and my stomach is still having some problems; but getting better. I can eat some what regularly.

It helped with my back and my anxiety; but the side effects were NOT worth it. I would warn anyone that is going to take Cymbalta to do your research and read up on the side effects. If you have them, stop taking it and talk to your doctor. I pointed the side effects out to my Dr; but he wanted me to stay on it for my back. I am now on LorTab 7.5 twice a day. I have been on narcotics before for my back and that was much easier to withdrawal from than Cymbalta."

I didn't think I could feel like my old self again anytime soon. Dealing with chronic pain has been overshadowing my life for over a year now and dealing with the constant anxiety was overwhelming. I have been able to start rebuilding the relationships I tore apart, and building my future with my brand new husband. I have to say, had it not been for Cymbalta, I think we would have been divorced 2 & 1/2 months into our marriage. It feels wonderful to laugh again and not force it through my teeth, and the joy of striking up a conversation! I have to admit, the first 2-3 weeks of starting were pretty rough. I lost about 10 lbs due to loss of appetite and nausea. And just having an awkward sensation all over, almost paranoid I would say was bothersome. I didn't want to do anything, I sat on the sofa day and night like a mute, only drinking water and eating an occasional cracker or two. I am still dealing with the constipation but have started taking fiber supplements, the dry mouth is another thing. My doctor suggested I chew sugarless gum but I'm not much into that so I am constantly running in and out of the bathroom. But I smile on the way in and the way out!

I went from Lexapro (where I gained 20 pounds in 6 months) to Cymbalta (up to 60mg. in 2 weeks) where I gained another 30 lbs in 6 months.  Yep, 50 lbe in one year.  I am so upset about it  and have been off for about 4 months.  I finally went to a psychiatrist that specializes in medications. He said I didn't need any of those meds and that they WOULD cause weight in almost everyone.  Yuk.  So he put me on Lamictal.  Said there's no weight gain.  When I took Cymbalta I felt pretty darned good, though, except worrying about my weight all the time.  It made me happy- but I have to admit I was pretty non-emotional.  Now that I've changed meds it is the first time I have cried in over a year!  It actually felt good in a way to have emotions... but I am also more quickly to react angrily.  I am not at a good level yet on the new med.  The cymbalta was really difficult to get off of, too.  Brain zaps were horrible and the headaches were too.  I wish I hadn't gone on it at all.  The positives were far outweighed (LOL) by the negatives for me.

Cymbalta has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I am able to go about every day life peacefully. While I still have days when I get upset, it is in no way the same as before. 
The only negative thing that I can report is after 4 years of being on it, I have noticed that I have become forgetful and experience episodes of confusion."

I gain 25lbs from the pill, which was not good, b/c i was getting married and already ordered my dress, but more serious than that, one of the side of effects, is that you can get small or mild tremors.  I was in my mom's kitchen and i could feel like mild vibrations, it was the scariest thing in the world. If anyone decides to take this medicine, please discuss the side effects with your doctor.

Prior to Cymbalta I found myself filled with anxiety and worry about everything.  I felt like everything was out of control and I couldn't control myself in any aspect (eating, sleeping, worrying, spending).

I now, not only feel great but I feel I have control again.  I've slowly loosing weight by diet and exercise which before I couldn't make myself do.  

While I experienced mild side effect at the start those are now gone. 

I guess when I read the review like most things you see a split of about 50/50 on positive/negative.  

The main thing I did see consistently was the severe withdraws but after a discussion with my doctor she indicated that when I'm ready to stop we should slowly wean off to minimize withdrawals.

However, feeling this good - I never want to stop.  "

I experienced popping sensations in my brain, uncontrollable shakes, sweats, horrible dreams, and much more. My life came to a stop. It was unbearable. I could NOT take care of my children, could not responsibly drive a car, imposable to make clear decisions, thoughts of suicide which I have never experienced. In my consumer opinion there is NO WAY any good could come from this drug. The only thing I found this drug will do while taking it is detach you from all emotions and you become numb to everything around you. ""Zombie like"" if you will. The withdraw last well after the meds stop! I would not recommend to anyone. This is happening to may people everyday. Someone PLEASE take notice before it hurts more people. A counselor that I went to see due to the fact that I was feeling so confused and crazy advised me to go to a drug rehabilitation center for a few days to make sure I did not need any medical or mental help. Cymbalta has caused more issues in my life than I ever dreamed of having. "

Although I experienced weight gain. My Dr has since lowered my dosage to 30 mg daily and I am having trouble sleeping, my anxiety is higher, and my Dr and I are discussing a possiblilty of changing my medication altogether.
I would also like to add that there was a period of time that I was without medication for about 12 days and it was horrible!! I experienced terrible withdrawl symptoms.  Insomnia, high anxiety, nausea, dizziness, extreme emotional distress and mood swings.  I do not ever recommend stopping medication without consulting your doctor and 'weaning' off of it. my situation was a bit different, I receive my meds through a mental health agency and they had a mix up in my orders. I couldn't afford to buy my own and they wouldn't call in to a local pharmacy. I was literally stuck.  My personal opionion? I don't especially recommend Cymbalta. That doesn't mean it's not right for you. That's for you and your Dr to decide."

Today was the first day I felt somewhat normal.  The first day I took it, I couldn't get off the couch.  Stomach was very upset and I felt like a balloon was blown up in my head. (I have had that every day so far) Severe insomnia with this drug, however I still feel energized the next day.  I do take naps during the day to compensate for the lack of sleep.  I began taking the drug at night/before bed, as my dr. recommended, but I would wake up and toss and turn all night.  Started to take it in the early afternoon.  We will see how that goes.  I only had one anxiety attack-Easter sunday at my boyfriend's family's house...so uncomfortable!!  Thank God for Xanex! I am apprehensive after reading all of the bad reviews Cymbalta received...but will continue until I ultimately make up my mind on my own.  I know it takes a week or two to adjust...good luck fellow review readers!

My doctor initially prescribed Zoloft, which I rook for 2.5 months last summer.  It did not help, and I had terrible side effects (including tremor and panic attacks).  Recently, she prescribed Cymbalta, which has been extremely effective for both the anxiety and depression.  I took 30 mg for two weeks, and experienced mild side effects for the first five days.  These included tremor, fatigue, and decreased appetite.  However, these soon went away and I felt the best I had in years!  Last week I began taking 60 mg a day (in the morning) and the side-effects returned to some extent.  However, I still feel good, and I highly recommend this drug.  I would suggest limiting caffeine intake though, especially if it is prescribed for anxiety.

I started to feel better overall and was getting out of the house which is a big deal for me.  I was very active and outgoing, I worked full time and attended college when I was raped and this caused me to have the symptoms mentioned above.  After about 6 months on this medication I noticed that I felt no emotions what so ever.  I became irritable, felt like my head was in a fog and did not care about anything at all, I stopped taking care of myself and just slept all day and most of the night.  Then I started to think about wanting to die.  One night I became very suicidal.  Luckily I was talking to my mom and she recognized something was really wrong and kept her eye on me.  We decided that I should stop the medication and I weaned myself off.  That was very hard.  I suffered horrible side effects from discontinuing this medication, after a month of weaning off I still suffered side affects.  I have been off this medication since December 08 and my mom said it is like she has her daughter back and my fiance also said I am not so numb to life.  I did not enjoy this medication and I think people should consider other alternatives if they are possible.  This is a very strong medication with major side effects.  I have been taking Celexa and Trazodone(at bedtime to help me sleep) and I have been doing much better.  I was on Celexa in the past and I did really well on it.  I also take xanax for panic attacks, but I have found that I have not needed this medication as much.  Side effects going off this medication were very hard to endure.

I previously was on Effexor but went off of the Effexor when trying to get pregnant. I also tried Zoloft for a short time as well. I believe the Effexor worked the best for my condition, keeping my level of anxiety at bay, but was very difficult to ween off of. Zoloft didn't seem to relieve as much of the anxiety issues, but I would recommend it for slight levels of depression or anxiety. I have a supplement prescription for Klonapin taken as needed. When I was on the Effexor, I needed the Klonapin the least. Cymbalta works well, but I'm worried about the fact that it's a newer drug and not sure of the long-term effects of it. I'm also concerned that I will never be able to be completely off of one of these medications due to the severe withdrawl effects. I do know that being on Cymbalta helps me to feel ""normal"" again. I can function well without having the stress of the anxiety issues always troubling me. It has changed my life in the fact that I can be more social and enjoy even going to meetings at work without worrying about anxiety. This medication should be reviewed carefully with a doctor before starting treatment."

I asked if there were any ""withdrawals"" I should be aware of since I already knew about the dizzyness after missing ONE dose. He assured me there was not.
I am on day 5 of no Cymbalta (but I am taking my prozac) and I feel like I have been on a 4 day drunk and still VERY tipsy. Do some quick online searches for Cymbalta withdrawal and you'll find MANY who have the same difficult time getting off this stuff. I did not find it to be any more effective than prozac and rated it a 2 for ease of use since you have to be so very careful not to miss an HOUR much less a dosage! I hate this stuff and am desperate to be out of this withdrawal stage. Be careful with this one, especially if you feel you are one who can take this for a year.. get better and get off them."

Within 2 weeks the anxiety came back. Over the last year I have tried 3 Rx's including Cymbalta. I did not like the side effects which included tiredness, feeling ""numb in the head"" and sexual side effects. I stopped just the other day and I'm back taking Remeron. Now I feel jittery. I'm not sure if it's a withdrawal symptom of stopping the Cymbalta."

I started out on 30mg and was upgraded to 60mg about 6 months ago. The only real problem I've had is if I missed a dose. I would have short episodes of dizziness and what someone else called the ""zap"" feeling in my head. So you should always make sure you don't miss a dose. I set a daily alarm on my cell phone to remind me to take it every day at the same time.When you start Cymbalta it takes about 2 weeks before you feel it working."

I have stuggled with each off and on for years. I used to take Lexapro. This time waas the worst the depression has ever been. I stopped enjoying anything and I didn't care. It was a stuggle to get myself out of bed and I would cry randomly throughout the day. The first week ,on 30mg daily,i had bad upset stomach and didnt want to move or get out of bed I felt the same just ""sicker"".However, the 2nd and 3rd weeks got better. The side effects lessoned and I started to feel like me again. After,a month my Dr. moved me to 60mg daily.I take it at night to  avoid the tiredness durning the day. Sideeffects now are night sweats, lack of sexual interest, and I do feel like i'm in ""lymbo"" I don't have any real strong emotions happy,sad, angry,excited etc... I always feel the same even in situations whenI should have an emotional reaction. I will speak to my dr.about this but anything beats the depression and anxity attacks..which has all stopped."

I was a prisoner of my mind for about 30 years. I have also taken Prozac everyday for mild depression for about 20 years. When starting to fall asleep I do experience involuntary body jerks sometimes and, I do get an electric shock feeling in my tongue followed by a metalic taste occasionally. The tongue zaps will wake me up from a deep sleep. I never had the body jerks or electric tongue zaps prior to taking the Cymbalta. BUT I can now leave my neighborhood!!! Thank goodness these side effects for me are not severe enough for me to stop taking the drug. I am no longer a prisoner of my own mind. I did have to work on my anticipatory anxiety but now it is mild since I have had so many positive experiences. The cymbalta so far has not allowed my anxiety to escalate to a full blown anxiety attack. I do take Ativan occasionally to help me get over major anticipatory anxiety. But now I rarely need to take the Ativan anymore.  The impossible for me is now possible thank GOD!!!! I also changed to a psychiatrist who is a pharmacologist. He's the one that put me on the Cymbalta. Don't give up there's a correct drug and dosage for you out there.

I am staying on 30 for now.  Helps with joint pain( arthritis)a lot but if I had neuropothy I would be taking Lyrica, that is the drug for MS and neuro pain.  I like most can't sleep but I couldn't sleep before the drug.  Take Zanax and Atarax (antihistimine) at night.  Works better then All 7 RX sleep drugs and is much cheeper.  Big problem with cymbalta is I gained 50lbs.

Can't live with them and can't live with out them!

Was prescribed cymbalta.  Was effective for a short period, gradually it began to effect my interpersonal relationships with office staff-improper remarks and loss of inhabitions-in both comments and deeds.  After one episode contacted the physicain and was prescribed 40 mg Lexapro.  First week was difficult-have now been taking lexapro over 2 years.  It is as effective as celexa, however sex drive and desire has been a side effect.  Hope to wean off of Lexapro in near future-currently I am not willing to try something else.

I have tried several different anti-depressant medications and I have found that Cymbalta is working so far. I have had no side effects from any of the medications I have taken in the past and I have had no side effects from Cymbalta either. I recommend it to others but I suggest they start with 30 mg and work up from there so their body gets use to the drug gradually.
3743$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/16/2008 10:31:27 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I am a 35 year old woman who has suffered with Panic Disorder for nearly 18 years.  I have taken Cymbalta, Effexor XR, Paxil, and Prozac.  I was put on Cymbalta because the Effexor XR had become ineffective at controlling the panic.  After being on Cymbalta for about a month, I began getting worse and worse.  I would sit on the couch and not move, or care about anything.  I decided I had to get off the medication (for fear I was going to hurt myself) and was advised to wean off slowly.  Over a four week period I gradually weaned myself off the medication.  This was the worst four weeks of my (and my families life).  The withdrawl from this medication is not easy.  I could hear myself blinking. I could hear the blood running through my veins.  I was so nauseous that I could barely eat, shower, or take care of my daughter.  I couldn't work, or drive.  After completely weaning myself off, it took another four weeks before I started to feel like a normal person again.  I've read numerous accounts of withdrawls exactly like mine.  BEWARE of this drug.

Huge mistake! The Zoloft really kept his anxiety at bay, Cymbalta made it worse.  He also got very depressed, something he never had a problem with before. He even had a few episodes so bad I would not leave him alone. After 1 month on Cymbalta he quit and went back on the Zoloft. So far there has been no bad effects of quitting the drug as some had reported. And after 1 week back on the Zoloft he is slowly getting back to his old self again! Other more weird side effects he had was constipation, insomnia, and loss of appetite. And the weidest of all was the fact that he was getting more and more depressed, but he could not sit still. He was out until 1:00 am while having to work the next day. I would really think about this drug before taking it, there are other better alternatives.

I talked to my doctor about it and he gave me a weeks trial of cymbalta, and said when I was done taking it to fill my prescription. When I started taking it, it made me feel physically horrible. I would get abdominal pain and dry heave. Every time I took it, 10 minutes later I spent 20 minutes in the restroom feeling sick to my stomach. It didn't really help at all. I would be left feeling empty and numb both physically and emotionally. Yes I wasn't really depressed, and my anxiety wasn't really as bad anymore, but I still didn't feel normal. I never filled my prescription either. Now I try to deal with my symptoms in the most natural way possible. I try to relax, meditate, think to myself, ""it could always be worse."""

Cymbalta was the first medication that, after about 16-20 days of treatment completely and consistently eased these symptoms. For the past 17 months, I have not experienced anything but what I would term ""normal"" anxiety and depression or sadness. If I miss two or more doses, however, I begin to experience uncontrollable irritation and anger. Also, the two major physical side effects seem to be bouts of severe but superficial itching over most of my body or sometimes isolated to a single spot and also erectile dysfunction, neither of which is serious enough that I would consider giving up the benefits of the medication."

Under the advice of my psychiatrist, after 5 days on it, I discontinued the mediacation.

As I sit here writing this I am trying to discontinue the use of cymbalta. I was put on cymbalta for more than 1 reason. Anxiety, Depression, and Pain. I have this awful feeling in my head and waves of ""yukky"" for lack of a better term that run through my body. It seemed to help after 7 weeks or so, but now that it has been 7 months I feel like I am without much feeling anymore.  With the exception of anger or edginess.  That I certainly feel! Constant short bouts of dizziness, mostly when getting up.  I am not looking forward to the next few weeks of trying to get off this medication. I pray that it is not as bad as Effexor.  All I do know is that my daughter deserves better and I am once again on the search for something else.  MAJOR ODD SIDE EFFECT....After taking years for my breast milk to dry up after the birth of my daughter, it has returned DUE TO CYMBALTA.  This side effect is rare but nonetheless it IS a side effect.  My doctor found this out for me when I informed her of this on my last visit.  I just feel like there are far more bad than good effects to come out of this medication. Thanks for reading. "

Even had a series if 12 ECTs TX in 2006....after 1 1/2 weeks I could tell a positive difference in my anxiety, using less Ativan. Now after 4 weeks, daily overall depression and anxiety are almost non-exsisitant. I do take Adderall xr 20 mg 5 times per week, which helps to kick up my energy level like it was prior to taking Cymbalta. The only 2 side effects for me are constipation(normal with these drugs) and lower energy(not normal for me) ...However, NOT enough to stop the Cymbalta....Thank You.......Janet

3896$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$8/11/2008 8:36:57 AM$Reviewer: NJ guy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$Been taking Cymbalta for a few months now. For the first week - I was started on a 30mg dose to acclamate my body. Lot's of nausea & sleepiness. Then I ramped up to the 60mg dose where I turned into a Zombie & did not interact with my kids or wife. After a month or 2 of taking a 1 hour nap after work & typically missing dinner, I asked my Dr. to drop it down to 30mg. Now I experience the sleepiness again. I did find that Cymbalta helped me straighten out, but my depressive thoughts did not go away - they were only suppressed. I was & continue to be very negative about work, as I am a small business owner who has suffered the most trying time in my career of over 20 years (financially). I believe for me Cymbalta was the right thing to do as I think it has had me focus on what is making me feel this way. I hate what I do. My insecurity has taken a huge toll on my physical & mental being. I am going to ask my Dr. to ween myself off of Cymbalta only for the reason I don't know how much more this can help me. I hope all of you find the correct doseage / treatment & can get back to being yourselves. Give it time & understand there are things you simply can't change in the world.

I had nerve damage which resulted from the surgerys, as well as depression and anxiety many years before I had been diagnosed with cancer. I was prescribed Cymbalta for both anxiety and nerve pain and have been taking Cymbalta 60 mg for over 5 yrs now, it has worked very well but with a few unwanted side effects. The main side effect is nausea, it also effects the sex drive which isn't always a good thing if you know what I mean. The last side effect is forgetting or simply just not taking it for whatever reason, my advise don't put yourself in that situation, it will make you feel awful. I felt numb and in slow motion ( example: my eyes would move to look at an object to the right of me, my eye balls moved but my sight was delayed on zeroing in on the object), it takes up to 3 days to feel normal again. For the most part the benefits of the drug out way the side effects and it does help with nerve pain. I would recommend this drug to all with nerve pain and anybody who suffers with depression and anxiety. Good luck...

I had been on both for generalized anxiety/depression (not together, but separately). The drug itself worked fine for me, not great, not terrible. Compared to Paxil, the Cymbalta didn't have near the brain zaps you suffer when you forget to take a dose -- I could forget a dose of Cymbalta for a day or two and be fine. Now, this sound contradictory, but my big hang-up comes after deciding that I wanted to see if I could go pill free. In short, Cymbalta has/was been VERY hard to ween off of. I stupidly tried ""cold turkey"" and that was a HUGE mistake -- I do not recommend it to anyone. I was pretty much bed ridden for 3 days -- sleeping, dizzy and nauseous... it hurt to even open my eyes. I then listened to reason and had my family doctor work me through a weening phase over a month which was more bearable, though the brain zaps was pretty continual, but not NEARLY as bad (you'd have to have experienced them to know what I'm talking about -- if you have -- you know exactly what I mean -- it's hard to explain the feeling). The last week I was trying to pull apart the 20mg caplets and guesstimate what half the granules was, but figured I was making a bigger mess than just stopping altogether. It's now been 4 days (as of 7-8-08). The brain zaps are still there, but very tolerable. Fortunately, I think I'm through it. I did this a year ago when on Paxil (weening off) and it was not NEAR this bad."

The paxil never worked very well for me- it was better than nothing but the reason I stuck with it was I had a psychiatrist who didn't trust newer meds and paxil was the oldest SSRI with implications for Anxiety. I switched to cymbalta when I changed doctors. 

First few weeks were a little rough, I was nauseus, constipated, and dizzy.  But after the first 3 weeks most of that went away.  I still have a little trouble with constipation, but it's worth it!  I am CALM most of the time now.  I can see things clearly!  I also give credit to a new Cognitive Behavioral Therapist, but I know the meds help.  And I have really nice, intricate dreams!

For all the people who are having a rough time with side effects early on (the first few days) try to wait it out! It might be worth it for you. "

No more pounding chest pains, panic attacks and I am a lot more calm but do not feel drugged or like a zombie in any way. Actually have more energy and can get more done in a day. Just wanted everyone to know it CAN work. I just hope I can stay on it long term. It also seems to have hepled with my migaines that I have been getting since the age of 15. They have gotten better as well. Didn't know that could ever happen! Good luck to you all.

  Was very difficult to stop taking it was one of those things that I had to try again and again and then finally made my mind up in order to feel better I had no choice but to stop.

  All sex drive was lost and in order to feel better I had no choice but to stop taking this medication although my doctor told me to keep taking this and over time I would feel better.

  I followed the doctor's instruction but I always felt the same, TIRED.

  So now I'm going without and waiting for my energy to return."

Brain zaps, fuzzieness etc lasted about 4 weeks.  Afterwards the hormonal swing of midmonth/perimenpause was HORRIBLE.  Don't know if it's related to withdrawal or not but am taking Wellbutrin now.  Weight gain was a big issue, night time bingeing was unstoppable.  WEIRD dreams and night sweats also became common after about 5 months of usage, that's why I stopped.  Great for leg cramps that I often had at night but not worth all the other side-effects.

So he put me on Cymbalta 30mg first week and then I am to adjust to 60mg starting week 2 and maintain there. I am only on day 4 of the 30mg and I feel much better- I also have been making sure I am taking a multivitamin regular with an added extra Iron pill ( as I have battled Anemia off and on since childhood)- so far the only ""side effect"" I've noticed is I'm not really hungry or interested in food anymore(which is also truely a god send- hince the term ""STRESS EATER"")so I've read all 641 responses so far and thought I'd add mine- I'll come back in a month and re-post and see if anythings changed- but so far so good!!!"

Before using this, I couldn't drive on a major road, do more than work at a minimum wage job, even though I had a college degree.  I couldn't handle the stress. 
After a month, I was able to drive to my first interview(in a long time), got the job, and I'm now working in my profession (and enjoying it!).And I have to drive down a six lane highway to get there.
I've had none of the side effects the others have had, except for losing weight (I like that one!)  I'm only on a 30mg dose, which may be why.  Whatever this drug does to the brain, is exactly what I need. This is the best I have ever felt in my whole life. 
I've tried Paxil and Celexa and never got these results. I did have bad side effects with both drugs.
All I can say is what works for some may not work for others.  This sure worked for me."

I knew I had panic attacks but they were small but seemed to be getting worse. About a week ago I ended up calling 911 bc i thought i was dieing. I have never ever felt like that before and growing up in such a horrible conditions I learned to be tough and could always handlt the small panic episodes or depression. They gave me ativan at the hospital and then I went to see a regualr metal health doctor. Im not on .5mg of xanax 3 times a day (or as needed), seems like i only end up taking 2 whole pills bc i break them in half. Im also on cymbalta 30mg for the first week then I will be on 60mg. The biggest side affect is how tired Iam. Ive stopped drinking any caffeine bc of fear it will make me jittery on the meds and worsen the panic. I cant even stay awake at work or driving. I feel really out of it but i understand this happens when you start new meds. When i was younger i was put on zoloft just for depression and stopped taking it after 3 days bc it made me so sick. The docs say I have a chemical embalance. Im only 24. Will I be like this forever? If love to find some message boards or support groups for this kinda thing. I need to start therapy but its wayyyyy to expensive even with my insurance! Please email me with any info or to exchange stories. [email protected] ;)

Anxiety. Went on for four hours.  Was able to finally fall asleep for 4 hours, woke in a haze, extremity pains were gone.  Had lower back ache, and aching in buttocks, and thighs off and on throughout the day.  Head remained achy and fuzzy throughout the day.  Spent the day in bed dealing with how horrible I felt.  Took until this morning (36 hrs) to feel like the effects of the medicine were out of my body.  The nausea was the easiest side effect to deal with, the body pain was horrendous.

The only complaint I have are the ""brain zaps"" that I get if I am late taking my next dose.  Its like someone whacks you on the head and you want to wince. Its really annoying! It definately is a reminder to me that I need to take the next pill, so I never miss a day...It takes about 2 hours after taking the next pill for the ""zaps"" to go away. I have also recently noticed that Im having trouble focusing my eyes when reading something closer to my face. Im not sure I can blame it on the Cymbalta because I have been taking it for about 3 yrs., although about 6 months ago I increased my dosage from 60mg.a day in the am, to adding 30mg at night to try to keep the ""Zaps"" away. Im backing off my dosage now to 30mg in the am and 30mg in the pm to still keep a more constant blood level in my system to keep the ""zaps"" away, and see if the lower dose makes a difference in the eyesight focusing issue. I have not experienced any neg. effects in reducing my dosage. (Only if I dont take any at all.) "

After taking Wellbrutrin for over 3 yrs, I started taking Cymbalta. This high feeling, and sleeping a lot is a puzzle to me. I took Zoloft for about 3 yrs and felt those same things, well all but the sleeping a lot. I couldn't sleep, so the doc put me on something called Trazadone, which at last count I've been on for over 6 yrs. Now it seems like when I take the cymbalta at night i also have to take the trazadone. Am I taking too much? I also take the wellbrutrin in the morning! I have also felt run down, like I'm not getting enough sleep, My hubby said that if he let me I could sleep 24 hours get up for an hour and go back to sleep for 24 more! Doc said that this is normal. At the moment I can say that I haven't had many bouts with ansity(sp). But truefully I really would like to get back to my old way of life... it seems like I have to schedule my life around this medication, and my sleeping accordingly.

4304$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/27/2008 10:05:53 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$5$"I posted on Christmas Eve morning. I was on 60 mg for only two days, could not take the ""acid"" trip high. The whole month of January I was not on anything, as I figured my insurance would not cover 2 scripts in one 30 day span. (foolish thinking). Anyway, I started the lowest dosage 3 days ago, (20mg) and I guess I really have to give it time. Thank you to all you out there who take time to write reviews, one in particular which says that the side effects DO go away was very encouraging to me. They haven't been as bad as the 60's I was on, but I still feel a slight ""buzz"". I had a really hard time falling asleep last night, which stinks, because I work VERY early in the morning. I can tolerate the buzz for now, and I am really hopeful it will go away soon. I have no appetite, but force myself to eat, and then it's fine, once I get that first bite in my mouth. I really don't need to loose any weight, even 10 pounds would make me too thin.My husband says in 3 days I am calmer, not picking at everyone about making too much noise,(what do I expect from 2 boys,aged 16 & 12 and a husband?) and doing chores, so I guess the men in my house are happier so far!!"

My doctor recommended I try Cymbalta for anxiety/mild depression so I did. WOW! I was wondering if my doc didn't accidently give a low dosage of acid or ectasy. Just an hour after taking Cymbalta on my first day, I felt very anxious, nervous my heart was jumpy. I tried relaxing in bed anything that was calming. Nothing worked I actually got worse. I felt soooo high i couldn't believe it. I had no energy i couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't sleep though either. I layed in bed til dawn tossing and turning. If i did drift off to sleep it was brief. I would start to fall asleep and I would see scary, evil looking faces that i couldn't really make out. It was so scary that I would wake up and feel even more anxiety. I have had the shakes for hours now, no appetite and a very bad headache. It's been over 12 hours and I still feel horrible. I know that Cymbalta is definatley not FOR ME.. Good luck to all who dare try it.

But it's a small price to pay to be able to get your life back in order.  I went off of it over a year ago and haven't had to go back.

My insurance would not cover two dosages a day, but they would cover one dosage a day, so I got the 60mg. I took one when I first came home with my script, about 5:30pm Sat night, and only slept 4 hours that night. I was feeling like I was having a bad acid trip, but I took my second one Sunday morning anyway. Yuck. While I could feel that I was better in my head, not so worried over stupid stuff, etc,etc, I was very jumpy inside, and was seeing trails from moving objects.I barely ate the whole day,smoked a million cigarettes and spent it worring about coming down off this unpleasant high. Suprisingly, I slept a full 8 hours last night, thankfully, and feel better today, as i will not take it today. I am a caffeine junkie, and while I tried to stay away from it yesterday, I had a cup of coffee already this morning, and I don't think that was a good idea. If a lower dosage does not work for me, I will go back to zoloft, as I had no problems taking that.

Headaches,chills,hot flashes, nerve twiching, bruising, brain feeling zapped, weight gain,immense need to eat red meat (I know gross), irritability, crying spells, so many more.  I went back to the Dr. who said the drug couldn't possible be responsible for all of the symptoms and since it had worked so well in the beginning I just needed my dose upped, which he did and the side effects stayed the same.  Coming off the drug was total hell, add to the above symtoms vertigo.  I was in a fog for a while.  I am currently trying natural supplements, exersice, accupuncture, music therapy and I am actually starting to feel good. I have my good days and bad days but I am finally starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. What actually funny is I started taking this drug for slight depression and anxiety at the urging of my psychologist.  Needless to say, I should have worked out those issues without the help of antidepressants, I will never, ever, ever, take something like these drugs as lightly as I did.  Good luck!

It has had very few side effects (basically none besides dry mouth).

4735$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/3/2007 2:39:37 PM$Reviewer: Sue, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$Taken once daily, the medicine was easy to use, however, I lost about 10 lbs.  I didn't eat.  I just slept, usually about 18 hrs per day.  I even found the medication to be behavior altering.  I was very apathetic, but at times, aggressive towards other people.

4760$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/25/2007 8:05:44 AM$Reviewer:  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$Cymbalta's effectiveness was gradual. So much so that I didn't realize how good it was working, but those around me notice a great deal. I'm sleeping normally now and haven't had much noticeable anxiety.
4768$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/23/2007 11:29:22 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I recommend this drug for anyone else who has been unsuccessful with other SSRIs (Zoloft, Paxil).  I experienced a bit of nausea the first two days, but have felt no remaining side effects since.  Also, unlike the SSRIs, I have experienced no weight gain - thank goodness!

I recommend Cymbalta but it is best to take it daily without missing even a day.  Try to take it at the same time everyday.

I also have mitral valve prolapse syndrome and I believe it has help alleviate some of those symptoms.
