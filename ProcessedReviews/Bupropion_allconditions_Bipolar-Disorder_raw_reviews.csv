14$Bipolar Depression$5/23/2018 8:43:59 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I am bipolar Type 2. I have been on bupropion for at least 15 years. It has been a Godsend for me. Without it, I lack motivation. It has allowed me to live a very successful and fulfilling life. (It also helps keeps your weight down). The downside is that you feel pretty awful if you miss a dose, but I make sure that seldom happens. Not for everyone, I know.You need to eat while taking it. Can cause involuntary jerks and tardic dyskinesia (muscles work slower than your brain) if you donÃ¢Â?Â?t.  I also take gabapentin, which helps eliminate seizures, so I suppose they balance each other out. Also can affect your balance if you arenÃ¢Â?Â?t hydrated. But all this is worth it to me. You learn how to deal with it. Hope this helps!

I am married  25 years my husband is not supportive, however, I have an excellent  psychologist.  I was relieved when I received a diagnostic of Bipolar Disorder, now I know what is ""wrong"". I am takin 75mg 3 pills daily, I  see some improvement. I am reaching out  attempting to socialize. I recently obtained a part time   teaching position. I am looking forward to resuming  activities I had stopped, art projects, I don't think about death and dying as much as I once did. I have lost weight. I don't drink because when I do I feel awful. I cannot tolerate loud noises, I attend church, and I am moving forward with my life and living.  Trying hard to remain in the present."

I tried exercise and diet changes, but that didn't work. The first day I took Bupropion, I noticed an increase in energy, but after two weeks, my energy level has dropped due to insomnia. I can't seem to sleep at night, but I slept all afternoon. I have slight headaches, thoughts of suicide, loss of appetite and interest in sex. When people talk to me, I feel alert in my mind, but my outward voice is depressed and unable to get the words out. I'm glad some other people mentioned the ringing in the ears. It's only happened one night, but it sounded like my neighbors had a radio on.

Im gonna stop for 2 days see if the stomach problems stop.  first of all i asked to be changed from zoloft.  as a man of 45 I had zero labido, and no erections whatsover.  buprorion helped with that a little but its either stomach pains and nausea or limp as a wet noodle.  has anybody tried anything else.  also as soon as the pill stops working i guess around 6 or 7 pm.

I started drinking and had all the symptoms of bipolar. With this medication I sleep at night, have become a much better person and parent. I have no side effects. I stopped smoking- not because of this medication - I used patches but this finally made me care enough to want to stop and I care enough to want to be better which is the greatest benefit of all. I've tried to stop it a couple of times and it was always a disaster. Finally recognizing that I need this and taking it everyday has helped tremendously. I've  been on for about ten years now except for those times when I thought I was well enough and tried to say I was okay and stopped for short periods. No more stopping. Different pills work for different people. This one works for me. People like me now!

Originally on celexa 40mg and lamictal 200mg.  Had trouble with concentration and short test proved attention-deficit problem.  Weaned off celexa and went on Wellbutrin 2 months ago.  I originally felt increase surge of energy, cleaning house, etc but also felt angry and hostile and not sure why, could not pinpoint my aggression.  Went back to doctor and he added 20mg of celexa back to the Wellbutrin.  Everything was great after that.  My mood and emotional well being was great.  Yes in the beginning of taking med, had nausea, stomach pain, alot of constipation mainly and that ""electrical current"" feeling everytime I turned my head. After celexa added to Wellbutrin I was ok within 24 hrs.  Side effects do get better. Feel like this is a good drug if you have depression, bipolar and attention problems.  Each person is different.  Doc will review all your meds and history and determine what is right for you.  If some medicine doesn't work after a few months then say so and request an adjustment.  I am doing fine now.  Good luck."

697$Bipolar Depression$2/12/2008 10:17:04 AM$Reviewer: D String, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$5$"I settled on Wellbutrin after trying several other antidepressants, because it left me with a normal level of energy as opposed to the other meds, which made me feel like I was made of lead. I have been with it for about ten years, with Eskalith (now Lithium carb) and the combination stabilized my moods, with two exceptions. I got a heightened sex drive. If I was a male I couldn't have left the house! I brought that down somewhat with meditation, because as a single woman I didn't need it. The other side effect was an increased sensitivity to beauty, particularly music. Most of my adult life I had enjoyed classical music and opera, and played and sung myself. On Wellbutrin most ""good"" music, whether an aria or a touching country music song, opened a floodgate of tears in me and I had to simply stop listening to it. Today I can listen to topicly less personal genres, such as adult Christian music, but the high-powered stuff the young people are doing I sense as being too beautiful to bear. Also, when singing or playing an instrument for myself or friends, I have to choose my pieces carefully so that I don't break down when performing them or when hearing my friends perform them. As you can imagine, John Denver is no longer in my repetoire. Music has always been a part of my life, and I'm taking it back! Mostof my friends are into listening to or making music, and I want more! I'm preparing to step away from Wellbutrin and try one of the antidepressants that worked safely before and left me with more aesthetic self-control. "

727$Bipolar Depression$2/25/2019 7:01:27 AM$Reviewer: Warox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"Firstly note this medicine not for everyone. Everyone's brain chemestry is different. It is one of the most popular and commonly used antidepressant due to it's general efficiency and fewer shitty side effects than other drugs. Personally, two weeks after starting 150mg bupropion, I'm already starting to feel somewhat better overall.

The way I've understood this drug works is by preventing the recapture of dopamine and noradrenaline. This leads to a slow but steady build up of those two chemicals in the brain. That' why the full efficiency of this drug is obtained a few weeks later after starting taking it. Dopamine is the feel good reward chemical which makes you feel slightly happier in general and makes you want to do things more since you're reward signal in the brain is ""boosted"". Not absolutely sur about the noradrenaline part but I think it's from this chemical adrenaline comes from. This could explain why this drug makes you more awake and energized than normally. Not sure but dopamine too i think helps keep awake. Anyways, even the specialists aren't exactly sure HOW antidepressants exactly works. 

 So far for me the first few days I felt a little ""something"" positively different about how I felt in general. I've been sadly having trouble to feel emotions and happyness for a very long time. Feel like a machine that mainly works eats and sleep. Now I'm starting to have more energy, want to do more things and actually enjoy myself sometimes. Better mood. I actually smile because I feel like it sometimes instead of smiling because I'M supposed to. Don't oversleep anymore. More sociable. Better attention and focus. Think better. Got some libido back. Losing fat and gaining muscle since im more active. Seems I'm actually starting to enjoy life a little. So far the pros are better than cons. Insomnia (i need seroquel to sleep well), rise in anxiety are the two downsides. A bit worst in the begining but it lessens. Got used to it. Definately worth it for me."

I also sweat excessively and became much more irritable, impatient, and more emotional. It did not ease my depression at all.

It doesn't make me as anxious as some of these drugs do. Also doesn't make me zombie-like. I take 150mgs twice a day with 1-3 mg Ativan as needed.Side effects for me include feeling hot, occasional bursts of anger(rare) and having to be extremely carfeul with alcohol and caffine. I have developed a low tolerance for both while taking this medication. Some benefits are clearer skin and no medication related weight gain.

I am on Lamictal (mood stabilizer), 350mg a day and can drink on that, but moderately (3-4 drinks fri and sat night).

Effective much of the time but not lately. Due to inadequate efficacy, it's time for me to tail off this medication in favor of Nortriptyline. Side effects (mostly beneficial) included sustained weight loss, constipation, increased energy. Would recommend this medication as best antidepressant overall. After 10+ years it is not surprising that the medication is no longer adequate for my needs.

They tend to 'destabilize' bipolar management and throw us into mania. I have tried many of the typical SSRI's in the past with little success and did try Wellbutrin SR at 150mg with mania after the first dose. Hit the wall again and new doc suggested Wellbutrin, not the long acting kind, at a small dose, 75mg, in the am and so far i'm impressed. I did experience a little sleepiness (yeah, backwards i know, but bipolar brains don't get the same side effects often)...but I also don't feel 'numb', like other treatments...i am flushing some, but will ask the doc about that at next visit and not worth stopping...very hopeful, which is nice...if u'r bipolar and in depression ask u'r doc about buproprion not the xl or sr in the am....good luck to all!

This was exactly what my brain needed for years. Zoloft and Paxil didnt help, and had bad side effects. I belive it depends on the person (Welbutrin wont be for everyone). I considerd anti-depressants to be a joke and ineffective.This time it was completely different. And the only side effect whatsoever is that I have less appetite. If you had  bad results with other meds before, I would strongly suggest to give it another try, but with a different medication this time.

The only thing that I noticed is that I don't have the perception of being thirsty but I make sure I drink at least 8 cups of water daily.  I also have a broken sleep at night and feel the need to eat when I wake up during the night which is unusual since welbutrin is supposed to take away from your appetite.  However, it might be the side effects of the other meds that I'm on or I might need a lower dose of wellbutrin.  Other than that, no complaints.

I started at a lower dose and the NPR finally upped it to 450 mg per day (300 in morning and 150 after 12 noon)After I got to 450 I was happy, smiling and ready to do things I had not thought about in quite some time. Then they increased my mood stabilizer (latuda). It did it's job too good and stopped the wellbutrin from increasing my happiness. So, the NPR reduced the Latuda again with the idea that we could increase if necessary but not as much. I am big, 300 pounds, and it is hard to get enough meds in my, large system to do the trick. By going to 450 it made the medicine available and has actually begun to work.Finally a Doc that thinks beyond the label or computer program.

It has worked well for me,but now I have more side effects than I did 2 years ago. Tremors in the morning, headaches always, forgetfulness and focusing has gotten worse, increased appetite, nausea increased. Pretty much every side affect has increased, but it still helps me with mood swings, anger issues, cry very little and have hardly any anxiety. I can still function on this medication better than any other meds in the past. For me it's worth the side effects, for now. know this, I also take other medications along with wellbutrin.

It was excellent. I became pregnant and had to get off of it, and I've been forgetful and more 'down' than when I was on it, but less nervous. Turns out, it really helped me be happy and concentrate, and I had much higher energy levels while on it. I miss it really, but I am toughing out a more natural approach to living life now.

I was taking this medication a long with others to help with my Bipolar. Everything was going great, but I didn't know I was very sensitive to medications. I started having petite mal seizures, many times a day and all through the night. I'm even on Topmax which is an antidepressant/anti seizure medication, and I was still having seizures. My doctor took me off the wellbutrin and my seizures have stopped,  but my mood is going down hill. It's a great medication other than the side affects.

He has had various medication mixes but Wellbutrin has usuallby been on of the components. His sleep is dreadful about 3 hours max, nightmares, involuntary jumpy they call pseudo-parkinsons from years of bipolar meds. Requip has been a big help. He functions somewhat better without always thinking somebody is after him or behind him. Very very hard to find pyschiatrists who deal with geriatric patients.

I gained several pounds, but it helped me with my depressive episodes.  Not vanished, but I could handle them better and function and have some fun.  About early 2012, my Doctor had me try Wellbutrin.  I felt like I was sliding into depression again.  Called and told him I needed another prescription, and used the Effexor I had left.  I wish Wellbutrin had worked better for me. I think it works for anxiety better. Hope this helps.  Medication is not perfect, but better than feeling blue every day.  Take care.

The main side effects I had were sleepiness, maintain weight, and a lil agitation (just in the beginning). After eight months of being on this, I haven't noticed a change in my depression...it's more like I don't feel anything, good or bad. I just feel blah. I have to say in comparison to Zoloft it's better to be on this. I had gained about 100 lbs. on Zoloft and felt in a daze all the time. My doctor has decided to take me off Wellbutrin to get me back 'up' instead of blah. I'm now trying Prozac and Lamictal...we'll see how that goes.

I experienced some traumatic life events recently and planned suicide. Sought help and wound up hospitalized. I was put on Resperidone which i later found was an anti-psychotic med. I was extremely depressed but clearly not pyschotic. Post hospital psych doctor prescribed Wellbutrin 150mg 2x daily with Lamictal which is an anti-seizure med. Initially felt more cheerful and hopeful. After not sleeping more than 3-4 hours per night for 9 consecutive nights I missed two days of work from pure exhaustion yet still can't sleep. Also feel like someone is squeezing my heart and I am having night sweats. I will not take this drug ever again. Stopped today. Can't wait to get this out of my body. Don't know what my options are at this point. I don't see my dr for 4 weeks."

1970$Bipolar Depression$12/17/2011 12:31:57 AM$Reviewer: gyptian, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$4$5$I take wellbutrin twice a day 150mg. And I find it to be a lot better than zoloft. And it doesn't take away my sex drive the zoloft did. It doesn't make me drowsy either. Nor does it keep me awake at night staring at the ceiling the other antidepressants have done in the past. I take it along with seroquel 75mg at bedtime and I'm able to fall asleep without any problems. The biggest complaint I have regarding seroquel is tha it makes me crave sweets and other foods, so you really have to excercise discipline as far a healthy diet is concerned (but its not easy) because seroquel raises glucose levels and can cause diabetes, so you really have to try and limit you carbohydrates as well. Other than that, I'm satified for now.

The only side effect I did experience was being very irritable. That side effect did seem to fade out after my first week. you do have to be careful taking this alone without a downer if you have bipolar, because it can make you very manic... manic feels good, but usually the results hurt you in the end...

I had horrible side effects including worsening depression, extreme sadness, constant crying, etc...it was a very bad time. as soon as i made the switch, it was like night and day. if bupropion doesn't work for you, don't write off wellbutrin. discuss taking the brand-name only with your doctor and see if it helps. Wellbutrin is very expensive though so i order a three month supply from CanadaDrugs and it saves me about $1500. "

I noticed that if I forget to take it after a three days I AM A MOODY B*** and snap at the least little things, but once I start takin it again I feel great.  Beside the sexual thing I love it and if I get moody people will ask me ""Did you take your happy pill today"" which will remind me.  I am only 30 and did not think I would ever need something this strong because I was on lexapro for YEARS and then even after they increased the dose to the Lexapro it stopped working.  This works GREAT, just wish I knew how to get my sex drive back."
2307$Bipolar Depression$3/1/2010 8:55:28 PM$Reviewer: Christine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$The Brand Wellbutrin XL 300 mg works very well for me, with Lamictal 200 mg and ongoing psychotherapy. It stabilizes my mood swings effectively. However, my insurance company decided to switch me to generic form of Wellbutrin. I assumed it was working for me until I hit bottom and was so out of control I didn't know what to do. I wasn't in therapy at the time. My GP was continuing the prescriptions and follow up with me after I moved away from my therapist. My GP recognized that I was in trouble during a routine exam and sent me immediately to a therapist she highly recommended. This therapist works closely with a psychiatrist that I am now seeing.  She recognized that the problem was the generic form of Wellbutrin (I wasn't taking Lamictal at that time).  I read several reviews by patients experiencing the same problem, with the same symptoms, which I found on the internet. I owe my life to these doctors for recognizing the problem and switching me back to Brand Wellbutrin XL.  My insurance company still won't cover the Brand but insists on the generic even though my doctors have explained the problem and insisted that I take the Brand name drug. I have to pay full price for Wellbutrin or suffer the dire consequences.  I have now ordered the drug from a reputable pharmacy in Canada at a lower price.

I have tried numerous drugs to treat my depression, none of them has worked as well as Wellbutrin. The only side effects I have experienced is that rarely I have mild sleep problems. This drug has been perscribed for me on two seperate occasions, as my depression can be significant at times and other drugs are tried. I have a problem with severe anxiety with panic attacts. When these symptoms come up I do take additional medication, however Wellbutrin will often times help ease these symptions. If I were a doctor I would highly recommend this drug.

Felt hopeless, like I would never really be ok. I have been taking wellbutrin xl 300 mg for three weeks and love it.  I have not been depressed, it has given me lots of energy, controls my appetite and I quit smoking!!  I had tried many antidepressants in the past and they all made me more depressed and very tired, I was constantly sleeping and had no personality, like I was living in a fog.  Wellbutrin gives me an overall feeling of well being.  I have not had any side effects.  I highly recommend trying wellbutrin to see if it works for you.  I am so glad that I did!!!

2399$Bipolar Depression$10/26/2009 12:53:30 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$"Wellbutrin helped me get my life back. I have BP and had an episode of severe depression that lasted several months last year. Before that, my episodes were manic except for a depressive episode when I was sixteen. The mania is not as severe or as lengthy as it was in my late teens and early/middle twenties so Lamictal alone has been enough to keep me stable at this point. After 10 weeks on Wellbutrin I finally started to crawl out of the dark pit. My current regimine is 300 Lamical at night and 300 Wellbutrin XL in the morning. The Wellbutrin causes ringing in the ears. I don't notice it too much until I sit down at the end of the day to relax (I have two small children). I enjoy reading, but am distracted too much by the ringing to concentrate. I am tolerating it because Wellbutrin has worked so well for my depression. Also, I had been on a generic and my Pharmacy switched to another generic brand and it really messed me up. I was very anxious (I don't suffer normally), confused, dizzy and had a strong metallic taste. My doc said that she's had other similar complaints and recommended switching to the name brand. I did and since then have been back to as close to normal as I'll ever get LOL:) Also, to all those suffering from sleep problems and irritability, do you drink caffeine? I'm very sensitive to it and have been off of it for six years. On occassion I will ""splurge"" and have a sweet tea or Dr. Pepper at a resturant, but then I'm very jittery, irritable, hyper and VERY chatty. When I finally go to bed (2-3 am) I wake up often which impacts my mood and concentration the next day...vicious cycle, so I stay away from it."

It is an extended release version of the drug which should help eliminate the need to take it more than once a day.  Anyway, my best advice to anyone with depression and/or bi-polar disorder is to try any meds that are offered or are available.  It took a while to find the medications that worked for me.  Don't be worried about taking more than one drug either, if you need to.  I have been taking Wellbutrin XL for 3 1/2 YEARS.  I am taking 450 mg and have been for most of that time period.  I have had excellent results on this med, and have had no side effects at all, ever, nor have I had any significant weight gain.  This medicine has worked wonderful for ME.  I have bi-polar disorder; therefore I also take Lamictal 400 mg, and Seroquel 100 mg.  This is the ""cocktail"" of meds that have worked for me.  Medicine affects everyone differently.  Don't think that just because one person had serious side effects that you will also.  This medicine may be just what you need.  Sometimes you have to trust the doctor more than the reviewers.  The doctors know what the side effects may be.  They are in no way trying to hurt you!  They are trying to help you the only way they know how!  Good luck and God bless you!  There is hope, just don't give up!"

That Doctor did me and probably many people a disservice by not expaining time frames with all these   different drugs, Like Prozac The doctor said
in a few weeks He could tell .  I felt it within 48 hours. That was the first drug I was on so I never really trusted them after that and no drug ever came close to helping me but it stoped working.  and I was put on
I couldnt even tell you how many drugs and combos. since then.  BUT I did learn that 
it is true that when they (who ever they are)say it may take six weeks , trust it , don't give up. Its a good drug and I dont

2555$Bipolar Depression$5/2/2009 9:39:22 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on Wellbutrin xl 450mg/day for a little over two years now and for me it is what works. My mood doesn't flip at the slightest negative event and one annoying thing no longer ruins an entire day for me. I can think clearly and positively without losing my ability to be upset when there is a reason to be. (nothing like showing up to a funeral grinning and cracking jokes because you can't feel sad.) I don't have issues with getting up in the morning (well not ones that I didn't have long before the bipolar set in. I am not a morning person.) and I don't have the issues of manic episodes where I can't sleep until I have to be medicated into unconsciousness. I no longer constantly sit at my desk with the lights off holding a box cutter and staring at it for hours or go off on screaming rants about things that are trivial. I feel in control of myself and my actions as opposed to the constant feeling of being out of control; an observer in my own self destruction. This is what it does for me. Considering that we are all complex creatures of finely balanced chemicals it may not for you but that doesn't mean there isn't something that can help you regain control of your life. Take time with your physician to figure out what is right for you. And be picky it's your life if something isn't working go back to your doctor and try something else don't torture yourself and end up even worse.

Wellbutrin with marginal dose of Depakote keeps me out of any significant depression, while allowing me the very slight hypomania that enhances creativity, productivity, and sociability (like a safe ""6"" or ""6.5"" on a 0-10 scale, zero being suicide).

So combining it with a med that will calm you, eg.Effexor, it should even everything out, or atleast for me it did. "

I took it for a week and felt like crap the whole week with horrible side effects: severe sweating, not being able to sleep, nausea, weird dreams and I was seeing things. I would wake up the next morning feeling, as my friend who as also been on it with the same side effects ""cracked out"".  This is the most horrible drug in the world. If you like feeling like you have the flu and are hungover at the same time, you might find this helpful."

I was getting aggravated easily and constantly bitchy. I had to stop. At that point my doc tried me on Cymbalta.

3073$Bipolar Depression$11/15/2007 3:40:08 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$4$4$Wellbutrin was very effective the first few months that i was taking it. I was generally in good moods and my moodswings were less intense. After about five months it stopped working, so my doctor put me on 300mg. There is a noticable difference in moods depending on whether you take it in the morning or at night. Taking it in the morning was difficult to remember, so i resumed taking it at night with my Seroquel. It is a stimulant and could be good for use in the morning if you are a morning person-- no one likes being awake but grumpy in the morning. Overall, i like this drug. It has been the most effective anti-depressant I have taken in a span on 6 years.
3075$Bipolar Depression$11/15/2007 3:37:13 PM$Reviewer: Bend, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$This drug made me not sleep for 3 weeks after getting it for severe depression. I lost 60lbs in 2 months - a pound a day. I shook all the time, felt sick to my stomach with a rotten feeling at the bottom. This is a horrible drug that gave me two months of absolute hell. It also made me quit smoking, temporarily, because I felt so sick that a cigarette would make it worse. Don't take wellbutrin.

In fact, this medication has an unpleasant odor and taste when taking.  I have to take an acid reflux med to keep from throwing up, and it doesn't always work.  The meds work, but hurt my tummy.  I am diabetic II under control.  I dread the a.m. and evening meal, as I have to eat and then take the meds ---except for the welbutrin in the evening.  I've been diagnosed since August, 2007, so I'm still working on everything.  I do not like throwing up anywhere, and especially at school.  I teach school.  To help, I take Lithium Carbonate 300 mg. twice daily.  I also take Glucophage 1000 mg. twice daily.  I take Calcium Citrate + D twice daily.  In addition, 20 mg. of Crestor at night.  (My cholestrol is at 200.)  I take AcipHex, 20 mg., of the morning.  I take 15 mg. of Dalmane to sleep.  However, I do not take the Dalmane or Crestor with the night pills.

As far as I can tell, the Welbutrin is working -- when I can keep it down.  I do think it is a combination of pills.  The Lithium is new since August ---- I had been on Depacote since 1999.  If you have any suggestions on which pills to take, and then the others to help the nausea, please feel free to advise.  Thank you for listening to me!"

I can never get out of bed in the morning.  It has made me way more irritiable than before almost causing me to lose close relationships and my job.  Ive been experiencing dizzness for the last four days oh and not to mention its made me gain weight.  The only good thing thats happened is allowed me to quit smoking after 11 years of smoking.  Now they are wanting to put me on seroquil and those side effects and reviews I have read are scaring me badly if Welbutrin is this bad for me whats seroquil gunna do?

3162$Bipolar Depression$9/23/2007 10:01:14 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  (Patient) $1$1$5$I have been on many bipolar medications over the years and have had much luck with most but the effects of each medication only lasts a year or 2. I took Wellbutrin and it made me VIOLENT! I had the most disturbing thoughts and dreams. It was soooo frightening. I have never been violent nor have I had violent thoughts or dreams until I took wellbutrin. No other medication ever made me feel this way, just Wellbutrin and I have taken many in my years. PLEASE be careful when taking this medication as with any other but I would rather be without anything in my system than to feel I want to harm others like I did with this medication. Needless to say, I IMMEDIATELY stopped this drug and never touched it again.
