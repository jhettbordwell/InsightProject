The worst side effect was the rapid weight gain. I was used to some weight gain from other meds I had used, but on divalproex I gained 40 lbs. in 2 months, then herniated a disc while exercising to take off the weight. Spent two years with back doctors, meanwhile my weight ballooned. I went from 200 (already overweight) to 275. At 275 I developed hight blood pressure, heart disease, rashes, lung problems, and my back pain was excruciating and constant. I stopped taking Divalproex, started a number of heart meds, and my cardiologist supervised a diet, and now I am down to 170. I will always have a bad back now, but it is better than it was. I still have the heart issues, but blood pressure is under control with medication. I am struggling to control my Bi-Polar II without medication, but this was definitely a case of the cure being worse than the disease. I wish I had never been on Divalproex. It nearly killed me, didn't help all that much anyway, and I will suffer the residual health problems the rest of my life.

8$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/25/2016 8:27:16 PM$Reviewer: Anish1979 , 35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$4$I was misdiagnosed for over 15 years with docs always saying it was just depression. I have bipolar with depression, anxiety, ADHD, agoraphobia, and on top of all that Fibromyalgia. When I was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder my doc tried many different meds, but I had severe reactions to all of them. The first med that worked was Lithium. I got my labs done and never had too much in my blood, but ended up losing over half my hair and gaining over 100 pounds! I weaned myself off of the Lithium and doc put me on Depakote/Divalprox ER. I lost 140 pounds in 6 months and got all my hair back. I take Cymbals, Valium, Ritalin, and Gabapentin as well. I felt like a new person, mild depression, mood swings much better, and rage/psycho feeling episodes were better. I have had to teach myself to avoid confrontations and other situations though. Grogginess in morning has always been there, could be meds for Fibromyalgia. Overall this mixture of meds has been a lifesaver! I am so glad to not feel like a lab rat anymore!

31$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/8/2014 12:16:19 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Divalproex is the third bipolar med I've tried, and it's the first that doesn't feel like a complete waste of money. I do get some slight tremors after my morning dose, but that's the only side effect I've experienced (my liver function's actually improved since I switched from lithium). There's a definite difference in my mood, too -- I'm far less irritable and edgy on divalproex than I felt on lithium or Lamictal, and it works fast enough to help prevent my bad moods from escalating.

43$Condition: Bipolar Depression$7/2/2013 11:25:45 AM$Reviewer: Tibby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$1$3$I have not had good experiences from the beginning. I'm not one to complain, so at first I just ignored the side effects because I wanted my moods to be stable, after multiple drug trials and being hospitalized from the bad reactions to other drug trials. I first started with 250mgs in the mornings, it caused me to become very shaky, nauseous and loss of appetite. The headaches were nothing; anyone should expect headaches when you’re trying to stable neurons in the brain. My Psychiatrist told me to start taking it at night time, that went well, so he increased the dose to 500mgs. Then I started experiencing some grogginess in the morning. I was extremely upset because I'm a morning person, I literally LIVE for mornings. Anyways, because I'm also ADD, the doctor prescribed me Vyvance for the morning and my mornings are back! (Vyvance is a whole other story - but I only take it when I absolutely need it because I find my body gets immune to it if I take it every day - I skip weekends - I'm a college student) So now after 6 months of taking it, my I find it help me tolerate a lot more and balance my moods. The only problem is now I’m starting to have side effects, such as abdominal pain, back pain, tiredness, nausea and vomiting. I know it’s because of my medication because I missed a dose the other night and my symptoms weren’t as bad the next day. I’m actually at work in the middle of nowhere, so I’m jumping on the plane tomorrow to see the Doctor. I found this medication worked, but too bad for the side effect.

After years of ""mood swings"" I sought help. Was in therapy for a year and then found a psychiatrist that prescribed 500mg of depakote er.  My mood is stabilized and I find my life being fuller and more productive. I do miss the creative bursts of the manic phase, but sure don't miss the random sex, excessive illicit druge use e.g. cocaine, and drinking myself to sleep. I hope this helps any of you going through what I've gone through. Been on it for almost a year and no side effects."

The last time I had it I was on the drug for about 10 weeks. I had other drugs too as preventive medicines. The combination helped me to get out of the headaches. Even otherwise I would have been out of it. That is the typical time period for my cluster. One side effect ( may be ) is dry skin like psoraisis - it was bad. Now it is getting better. Another effect was trembling of my hands when I tried to pick something like a glass of water. It has gotten better since I am off the drug. Drowsiness was there but it made it difficult to go to sleep.

After trying multiple meds that caused me to gain weight, back-and-forth prevention of migraines, and changes in my blood pressure that is already low, I landed on this one.  I am to take one to two 500mg at bedtime since it may cause drowsiness.  That is a happy change since so many of the other meds caused insomnia.  I still have a lot of weight from trying to find the right med, but am glad that this is working for its primary goal--headache free.  I am thrilled that it works, but am looking to get off meds so that my body can readjust.  Not sure how much this med affects periods, but I have missed two in a year now and I used to be VERY regular!  I will be going in for a check-up again to make sure that it isn't affecting anything else.

My main problem is that I am a vet and suffer from PTSD and I can't get my mind to shut off. This med has slowed down my thought patterns. I can still function, but I don't have massive confusion. I do suffer from short term memory delay which in my case is worth the trade of having ""peace"" in my head. I also suffer from fibromyalgia. I have not seen much improvement in that area. Over all I am pleased. I do suffer some vision problems but as time goes on they seem to be less. I take it at night so I do sleep. Again, the biggest thing this drug has done for me is slow my racing thoughts down. I feel less impulsive, less edgy and less nervous.

I had really bad migraines with aura (including tingling in left arm, left leg tightness, periods of lethargy/inability, mood swings, bright colors, sensitivity to light, ""sinus"" pain, followed by a moderate headache...total disruption of my life, I had even just moved and started a new job (luckily not much was expected of me at work when I started).

Tried Topamax for a month, did not relieve aura symptoms and cause terrible insomnia and was giving me terrible side effects.

Switched away from stubborn doc, went to specialist, had MRI, EEG, and other test to make sure of the diagnosis, and was prescribed this (500mg/day), worked within a few days. I was back to my normal self.

No aura symptoms, and greatly controlled headache pain (only occasional ""sinus pain"" caused by migraine remained). I was prescribed amitryptiline 25 mg/day for this pain and IBS burning, I only take it occasionally not regularly. 

The low dose of amitryptiline seemed to augment the positive effects of the Depakote (at first would have some very minor prickling or stinging paid from the combo, but it went away in a month and wasn't a problem).

I get a rash 8 hours after I put on sunscreen, but I think this happened once before when I wasn't even taking Depakote (I wasn't taking anything as a recall). 

No noticeable side effects from Depakote at first. 

I gained 20 lbs over a year, but it might've been from my thyroid being underactive (this was found later on, and is not necessarily related to the depakote according to my doctor). Also might've been because my appetite returned because I was feeling healthy again.

The insomnia I experienced from Topamax disappeared after switching to this. However, I have not tried the new generic, and my insurance is forcing to do the generic the next time I refill."

Then I started having side effects from the maxalt since I was taking it so often. I have used maxalt for over 20 years for occasional migraine prevention. Taking it every day concerned me. My neuro PA tried several treatments for me, and the last time I saw him prescribed depakote.  I took one (250 mg) pill at bedtime since it can cause drowsiness. He advised I work up to one pill in the morning and one at night once my body adjusted to it. THE NEXT MORNING after my first pill, I woke up headache-free.  I have only had to take maxalt twice in the last month; probably because I drank alcohol a few times which can sometimes lead to a headache. They were not morning headaches. I am thrilled with this drug! No more 3-4am headaches waking me up requiring me to medicate. I never upped my dose to the am pill one since it seems to be working with just one at night. I'm going to go back to review my progress with my PA. I am not crazy about the side effects I have read about, but so far I haven't noticed anything but some back pain. I'm curious how long I will be on this drug.  For me, at this time, it has been very effective in giving me my head back pain-free.  I'm a fan.

Almost lost my job because the side effects were effecting my work. I quit taking Depakote on my own, by tapering off of it for about 5 days. Do NOT stop taking this drug cold turkey! The withdrawal side effects are very bad. Worst drug I have ever taken in my life and I have taken many drugs in the years I have dealt with bipolar disorder.

I have suffered from Migraine for 20 years until I started a 250mg twice daily dose of Depakote.  Despite getting them twice monthly, I have not had a Migraine headache since.

I have also had no unsatisfactory side-effects from this medication.  The two ""side-effects"" I *have* experienced have been a dramatic reduction in the amount of anxiety I experience and a strange effect that has made consuming alcohol unenjoyable.  My alcohol consumption prior to Depakote was very occasional but alcohol generally made me feel more relaxed or had a positive effect on my mood.  While taking Depakote, if I drink enough to feel the effects of alcohol (about a half of a glass of wine), it is accompanied by minor depression.  I no longer consume any alcohol as a result and since I wasn't much of a drinker to begin with, this has been totally acceptable.

I used to get Migraine episodes twice monthy, peeking in September and April at sometimes weekly. Episodes would last for about 3-days of intense pain, with aura and nausea followed by one day of listlessness (though no emotional depression).  I have not had one single episode since starting this medication and have been taking it for two years without incident.  This medication -- costing under $5/month -- has *completely* changed my life, reducing my anxiety not just by the medications direct effects but the indirect effect of not having to worry if I'll have a sudden, unexpected, horrible pain in my skull.  I couldn't be more grateful."

Nothing has worked for me.  On occasion Fioricet helped.  Other preventatives did nothing.  Everyday I had some kind of headache.  Neurologist put me on dosage to go up to 1000 mg a day. I started slowly because I am hyper-sensitive to medication. On positive side, headaches have stopped.  Little one here and there.  I am in a much better place mentally, positive attitude, motivated to go to the gym, have no appetite (have to lose 50 pounds) so okay. Negative side, by the time I got to 750 mg, I was having severe anxiety/panic attacks, crying for no reason, calling my ex-fiance to have him come back to me after not thinking of him for five months, restless, leg shaking, lot of energy, signed up for a 5K (don't run), and knees are killing me.

He is my brother that takes this medication. He is 15 and it has worked exceptionally well for him. He didn't have another seizure until he missed doses of the medication. The only downside to this med is the insomnia. He has a bad case of that and it gives him troubles with school. Also, like most seizure medications it caused his hair to fall out.

I would recommend this medicine to anyone having seizures in spite of the side effects because it causes seizures to completely stop. Christopher didn't have a seizure for a year and 7 months because of Depakote. He will highly  likely not have another one since we are going to have close watch on him making sure he takes the medication morning and night.

Depakote causes people to be seizure free. As long as they take the medication of course. Some people have to take this for a lifetime but they are willing to do that to be seizure free. Many patients taking this medication have decided that the side effects are worth it if that means they have no more seizures. I hope this review will help someone and ease a few minds.

If your child or a loved one has just started having seizures and you're scared and need someone to talk to please message me anytime. jesscrudup @ yahoo.com"

The combination has worked wonders for me. I also did cognitive behavior therapy for the first two years when I was diagnosed to help as well.  I sleep great, laugh, enjoy life, and the anxiety is completely gone.  The Zoloft/ depakote turns off the rapid thoughts like a light switch!  I had hypo mania with more depressive episodes.  The psychiatrist said the anxiety is caused from the rapid cycling.  It feels great to be anxiety free, not worry and be able to handle life as a confident person.  I do occasionally take Xanax when in extremely stressful situations- once every 3-4 months. I exercise daily and eat fairly healthy.  The only IDE effect was gaining about 30 pounds over the last 10 years.  However, I would rather be 30 pounds heavier and not feel depressed, suicidal, anxious, and paralyzed.

I tried so many ssris, and antidepressants but nothing worked. I was nervous about trying this medication because of the severe side effects that could happen but inane so excited that I tried it. For the first time in 4 years I feel normal, my relationships with my husband and mom are great. I'm enjoying life and I'm getting complimented on how well I am doing. It also helps me sleep at night and prevents me from having so many migraines. It took me about 2 weeks to adjust but after that I have been great. The only side effects: drowsy, and some blurred vision when I get to tired. Also, I don't feel like a zombie like the antidepressants made me feel. Overall I'm very happy. My only concern is that you can't take it when your pregnant, and I want to have a baby in the next few years.

There were long perions here I would have 1 or 2 a year. Took a bad fall(face plant) and severely injured my spine. It was 7 months before being prescribed Depakote 500mg, (after trying many other options) a week into the medication I suddenly realized my near daily ritual of lying in bed with pillow over my head was no longer necessary. I realize 2 weeks into this medication is too early to know for sure of its effectiveness, but for me a week without a migraine puts this drug in my miracle catagory. I have some stomach irritation, which I hope will soon go away. No medication is right for everyone so if this doesn't work for you keep trying. Good luck !

Before this I had taken other preventive and even medication for after the headaches appear with little luck of them working. I am taking 4 250mg tablets a day and it works wonders with my migraines. The only problem I have with it is that my hair is falling out in clumps. I read the warnings but didn't listen to them much. My hair is my baby and was very long and was as thick as a half dollar but after 3 months on this medication my hair started falling out. Now 6 months later it is as thick as a quarter. If you just want to get rid of your headaches, this is a good choice for you. You can always change it if your hair starts falling out. Im going to stay on it because of how well it works.

Spending too much money, freaking out, not paying attention although on adhd meds for that which she lowered - said it can cause mania. I have lowered my caffeine intake and I still need kava plus theonine to calm me down or 3-4 cups a day of chammomile tea. I really hope this thing works.

I was given two doses of Depakote intravenously against my will. (stupidly I signed some release that took my rights away)I guess my not falling after the first, prompted that particular doctor (Dr. Matias) to give me another dose against my will. 18-24hrs later I had a reaction to whatever they gave me in the ER of QMC. It amounted to what I can only describe as a ""Joker"" face, yes from Batman with Michael Keaton. I know it was Depakote, but they tried to lie and say the first dose was something different. So I had a huge smile on my face, that wouldn't go away. This troubled the nurses and doctors who were providing my care, and they rushed to get something to counteract what the ER of QMC had given me. They weren't even sure what the ER gave me, but they knew something was wrong. I didn't feel like anything was wrong, my face was just cramped up in a smile. I could breathe and talk and walk. I just couldn't relax my face. To be honest I don't even know what was going on, I am not a doctor. I believe what ever they gave me worked, because my smile relaxed and I was able to get some rest. But if you asked me to tell you what they gave me, I couldn't for sure this or that. I felt like I was mistreated by the Queens Medical Center's ER, I feel like I was lied to, poked and prodded. The most important thing is I was saying the whole time ""I don't want anything, don't give me drugs, I DON'T WANT IT!"" Somehow they still had the power to do it, Lucky I am still here Matias, O dr matias. Pfft! "

As soon as I was switched to Divalproex which is generic for depakote, I did a complete 180. from what I was on before. I was able to speak, Get out of bed. which prior to resprital & my 4 day manic phase, I had never been so depressed in my life when they put me on resprital. Within the first 3 days I was on divalproex, I started talking again, feeling more energy to get out of the bed & within a couple of weeks I felt more like my self again not completly but more wich gave me hope. I with by the grace of God & complete dedication to my my meds & mental health. I am doing really wellon this medicine considering the disease which I've struggled with now for 9 years, 2 manic episodes that both came with psycosis for more than a year for each one. I have been manic free. I don't like jumping meds so I haven't got to experience alot of them to find out if there is something better than depakote. I am too worried that one will put me in the state that resprital did, but the ones I know that come with bad side effcts are Resprital & Ambilify! So I hope this helps someone. I have Bipolar Mixed! Also great for headaches I rarely get one, & I only take one at night.:)

Severe tremors, memory loss, extreme sleepiness, I gained 10lbs in ten days, became extremely irritable, and literally thought I was going to die if I took another pill. I had severe thoughts of hopelessness and disturbing thoughts and dreams as well.  I have been off of Depakote today for 7 days and am still feeling the side-effects. I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone.

After some issues with my menstrual cycle, my medication was briefly switched to phenobarbital (briefly due to the fact that I had severe mood swings and nausea) before switching back to Depakote. After starting college, I began to wake up dizzy, my neurologist believed I was having seizures in my sleep and the dosage of my medicine was increased to 500 mg 2x day. For several years, the dosage remained the same.  Over the last three years, though, I have begun to experience tonic-clonic seizures so the dosage is now 750 mg 2x a day. I feel tired and generally lethargic most of the time. Rarely do I ever feel energized. Over the last 14 years, I have noticed a decrease in my memory, but I don't know if it's side effects of the medication, epilepsy or both. My neurologist has me take folic acid supplement in case I become pregnant and Vitamin D with Calcium supplements to prevent bone thinning. As long as I take my medication REGULARLY (I set an alarm on my cell phone so I always remember to take it exactly 12 hours apart), my seizures appear to be well-controlled although I have had two in the last six months. Those episodes coupled with the general side effects have led me to contemplate switching medications yet I'm afraid that's a ""grass is greener on the other side"" approach and will do more harm than good.

I was prescribed this medication and experienced some very nasty side effects like difficulty breathing and irregular heart palpitations. My doctor told me that the medication was safe and tested however upon further researching the drug I found out that it is actually new and the way in which it actually effects the brain is unknown. I highly suggest reading the printout before taking this drug and strongly recommend getting off of this drug as soon as you can if you can; BUT please don't suddenly stop taking this medication it could lead to fatal long lasting seizures."

At first I took Depakote in the morning, which resulted in me not being able to function during the day.I discussed this with my psychiatrist who advised me to take my medication before going to bed.This has worked well, I sleep better and funtion ok during the day - sometimes feeling a little tired.I take Depakote, Fluoxetine and sometimes Propanolol for anxiety.Depakote suits me and my mind is very much calmer with no racing thoughts and I am more able to keep things in perspective.I am now able to get myself to the gym - which helps greatly with my moods.I would recommend Depakote, but,I do appreciate that what I have read in other reviews that it is definitely not for every one.I began to begin feeling the benefits of Depakote a month after starting it.I no longer get crazy mood swings, so for me this drug works well - although I am concerned about its toxicity levels etc.Now that I am feeling more balanced I combine my drugs with eating healthily and getting lots of excercise.This is a massive improvement as I used to suffer from low self esteem and lack of confidence. I hope that if you try Depakote that it works as well for you as  it has for me. I now have far more good days than bad.

However, if anything happened in my schedule to throw me off just a little bit, I would have 2-3 seizures a day for about a week. I took this drug from age 8-15 and still have epilepsy to this day but now I don't use medication because of what Depakote did to me. I don't remember my childhood and it wasn't that long ago. I do remember the faces of family members, or what food I have eaten today. I gained 100 pounds while on this drug and within three months of getting off of it, I lost 80 pounds. I have had vicious mood swings since day one and still have them today. A very large part of me feels that Depakote has actually been a worse part of my life than the epilepsy that doesn't want to go away. Yes it stopped the seizures most of the time, but when it didn't, they were many times worse. If there are any other medications out there that you are able to take and results would be gained, I STRONGLY recommend that you do so. Depakote took away my childhood and forced me to grow up at the ripe old age of 8.

I was ready for weight gain, but the opposite has happened.  I no longer find myself craving fatty, starchy, fried foods.  
The other side effect that I was shocked to have is a marked increase in my libido.  I feel like a 20 year old.
I do not like feeling so drowsy.  It has slowed down my overall system so much.  I can't get up and going until about 2pm or later.  For years I was up and out of bed by 7am or earlier.  I am considering reintroducing caffeine to my diet.  With years of anxiety, I stopped using caffeine.  Now with this medication, I'm thinking that maybe a little will help me to get going earlier in the day.  
Also it has my slowed my GI system.  I'm not constipated, I just am not as ""regular"" as I was prior to the drug.  I'm taking fiber supplement and eating tons of veggies/fruit to combat this side effect.
It's helped with my terrible anger problems.  I'm not nearly as obnoxious on the road as I used to be.  
It amazes me at how different every one's response to Depakote is.  It just goes to show that we're all unique.

Within 3 doses her seizures stopped all together. 2 seizure free years later and she is currently getting weaned off. So happy that this drug worked for her. The only side effect she had was hair loss so we are hoping that won't be an issue any longer. The only downside to this drug is that we had to serve it with applesauce 2x a day.

That was 17yrs ago. A good doctor finally took me off it. I started taking it for petit mal seizures and it helped some then around 20 I developed grand mal seizures and continued to have them every 6-8 months till I stopped Depakote. During my teen years and in to my late 20's I was very depressed and tried to committ suicide 8 times. I never thought Depakote could have been the cause of all that, but since being off it for a year now it's like someone turned the depression switch off and all those horrible moods have all but left. I never had anyone question the medication while I was in and out of hospitals and therapists offices and I never thought about it till I went off depakote and my mood drastically improved. Becareful for that if you are taking this med and after stopping depakote 30lbs melted off without a change in diet or exercise. I am on Keppra now and haven't noticed any real problems.

Doctors should not just prescribe this med to teens without monitoring side effects. Could never wake up in the morning. Felt like I was walking through fog.  Side effects robbed me of two years of my life - I can barely remember them because of this drug.  It's several years later - I have had great success off medication and have been able to manage depression with diet, exercise, and lots of work. It isn't easy but consider if the drug is adding more symptoms than its relieving if it isn't working. Ask to stop.

He was sent home and retested two days later and his range was 6248 - under 100 being normal.  We saw a pediatric specialist today and his liver is swollen two times the normal size and he had additional blood tests and if the levels have not gone down he will be admitted inpatient today.

Took 1,000 mg/day. No observable side-effects except about 10 lb. weight gain. However, about a year ago, I read an article in the popular press about Depakote causing bone thinning. Neither my PCP or neurologist had mentioned this (perhaps because I am a male.) Searching the Internet, I found a number of studies in journals such as Neurology, dating from about 2001, establishing a like between Depakote and osteoporosis.

I asked for a bone scan and, sure enough, had osteoporosis, even though I had none of the risk factors. I had no family history, have run for 30 years (weight-bearing exercise strengthens bones), and took calcium supplements.

I have gotten off Depakote.

Anyone taking Depakote for extended periods of time, in my opinion, should have regular bone scan, one at least every three years. At least one study showed that bone thinning began in as little as one year of use.

I am very surprised that information,like the product labeling,  about the side-effects of Depakote rarely mention bone-thinning (WebMD being an exception)."

393$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/21/2010 3:54:54 AM$Reviewer: SFWII, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$After several attempts at finding the right med. for BPII depression, my psych. started me on an aggresive course of Depakote, while watching lvls. and careful controlling of med. prescribing times, with ample warnings to me and careful consideration unto my situation.  Being that I have BPII, my depressive side can get severely out of control also and I have tried so many of the newer, or better, anti-depressants on this,sometimes, ridiculous market of psychiatric medications.  These meds. would only bump me up into a manic-type state and always leave me worse in the long run.  Depakote seemed to be the ONLY  answer we could agree on and I have remained on it for possibly 20 years now.  Only on an extreme occasion, would another anti-deppresive be ordered, only to fail, in the short course of sometimes, days. So, basically, we,ve remained with Depakote thoughout the long-haul of BPII depression.  Sorry to be so run-on, but it's been over two decades working with this medication unto ongoing treatment.   Depakote can help to control symptoms, offer stabillaty where allowed and offer quite few side-effects, in the more, short-term usage.  That is as far as I am concerned.  I would have to say GOOD CHOICE, sometimes the older ones may be the better ones, all things considered.  One more thought, if I may, be SURE to work closely with your' Dr. concerning long-term usuage, such as with my case, as this is imperative for psycho/somatic health.  Teamwork is so important concerning your overall health, choose your' Dr. wisely, He/She will be working best with you when all bases are covered unto prescribing Depakote and any testing of it that should be involved.

I was nervous about taking depakote since I heard it makes you tired, and with taking my other meds, I can't afford to be any more tired!  But my doc insisted I try it, since Prozak just made me suicidal and even crazier.  The one side effect I seem to notice is that, instead of making me tired, it does the opposite - seems to cancel out the sleeping effect of the ativan!!  It's been a rough couple of days, with having to work a full time job and take care of my family on almost no sleep.  Id like to know if anyone else is having the same problem???  I even have tried having a cocktail or 2 in the evening w/ my meds to help me fall asleep, but to no avail....  HELP!!!  The med works w/ my severe mood swings, but I need to sleep too!

I immediately noticed side effects: his hands became very shaky (to the point where he quite drawing and coloring), he complained of dizziness and had frequent nightmares.  After a few months of use, my son would know when it was time to take it because the shaking/dizziness would worsen if we were late or missed a dose.  However, it works very well for him. Aside from having to have his blood tested for liver enzymes every 6 months, he has had only two seizures since he began taking it. We have learned to deal with the side effects. He no longer uses coloring books but rather draws freehand so he doesn't have to worry about going outside the lines, and we got a dreamcatcher for his nightmares, and he doesn't complain of bad dreams near as much. Overall, it has been well worth it.

The first Psychiatrist I saw prescribed this to me.  I have had my name CLEARED by other Psychiatrist, confirming that I do not even have Bipolar Disorder.
As for this medication, this is absolutely garbage.  It causes intense weight gain, hair loss, and dulling of emotions.  When you take this, you can't remember things as well either, and all creativity is lost.  What's worse is, that when taken, it only works temporarily, and then you have to keep increasing the dosage because your body gets used to it.  Don't take this medication."

My body got use to the dose and the doctor increased the dose. I immediatly noticed joint and muscle pain, and a pain running from my abdomin through my right testicle to about a 6"" down my leg. I backed off the drug and it no longer had the same effect. On the good side I had no emotions, no fear, no remourse, no cares when people die, it made me laugh at pain, when people got injured, when people fall down stairs,ect. I eventually dropped off and went on lithium. ""DO NOT TAKE LITHIUM"" look at the side effects. Now I have problems with my thyroid from Lithium. I'm dropping lithium and going back on depakote in the hopes my thyroid will function properly concidering I just started Lithium!"

It didn't solve any problems but in my case it caused muscular degeneration. When I complained about how weak I felt, the Doctors attributed it to symptoms of the Bipolar and didn't take me seriously. It progressed into bed wetting problems, as I no longer had enough muscle control to control my bladder. When I was 18 the damage was so bad I suffered from asthma. I finally had enough, and took myself off medications all together in October of 2002. I hoarded the medications, waiting for a doctor note to show improvement was noted. Once I had it, I told him I wasn't taking medications and successfully forced him to concede that in my case they were causing most of my problems. It has been over 7 years since I have been on drugs. I still have symptoms of Bipolar, but I control it with Meditation. Not Medication. But the muscular degeneration was so bad that I still suffer some of the damage. I only last year recovered controller of my bladder, and this year I am getting back muscle tone around my body. As far as I am concerned, if I continued taking this drug I would be dead now. Instead, I am a home owner with a perfect credit score and I lead a productive and full filling life. I just learned to create goals for myself as a way of dealing with the depression, and use common sense for dealing with the anxiety. No one should take this drug if you feel yourself getting weak.

So my doctor changed medication to Lamictal, I lost twenty pounds in 1 month! But, it did not control my seizures at all. At that time I was having 2 grand mal seizures a month. I went back to Depakote and of course gained the 20 pounds back plus 10 more! I have been on Depakote now since then. It absolutely controls my grand mal seizures, but it does not control twitching/tremors. But, like everyone else I absolutely HATE the side effects of this medicine. I am incredibly tired, moody, zombie-like, and I've experienced the weight gain. If I miss one dose I get the WORST migraine ever!!! Also, it is expensive with or without insurance. W/o insurance it cost me around $289 with my insurance it cost me $100. Because they offer a generic they jacked up the price for the ""non-preffered brand name"". What they need to understand is the generic doesn't work for everyone. It didnt work for me. I had even more tremors and had the feeling of an aura all the time, I couldn't function."

I have experienced some weight gain, minor hair loss, and am more emotional (tears of joy sort of thing that some men may have a problem accepting).  But overall I feel better and am happy.  I avoid alcohol because more than one drink can make me feel depressed.  I take two 250mg tabs at bedtime and one 250mg tab in the morning.  I didn't have any problem when I was switched to the generic.

I've real a lot and everyone's body/brain chemistry is soo different.
But for me Depakote is one of (I believe 1--13) drugs I've taken for my bipolar disorder that has helped.  But it deft. does make you gain weight but not as much as I thought. All the meds over the past 4 yrs have so I'm battling it on my own.
Also -I read it's good for ppl who get headaches? Well ever since begining my frequent headaches have become daily. I'm currently recieveing accupunture for relief. And I've had hair loss which I believe is a result of this drug. But overall I believe it's helped. But I also give myself credit because I go to therapy on a regular basis andreally try to control my moods the best I can. So it's hard to tell what's making the difference. I kinda don't believe in any of the psych meds...that's a whole nother story"

I was devastated when the psych diagnosed me. The doctor prescribed Depakote and I don't recall looking into the drug prior to ingesting it. I remember experiencing very VIVID dreams. They were quite scary and seemed very real to me. When I brought this to the physician's attention, he informed me, the drug had to be in my system for more than 2 weeks in order to experience the effectiveness. The physician never went over any of the side effects and basically told me I was crazy and I wasn't experiencing what I was experiencing. I was also having hallucinations. I was sleeping during the day and could not sleep at night. I was freaking out and felt like I wanted to die. My best friend was mortified. That was not the person she knew. I wasn't the person that anyone knew. I have since stopped taking the drug. Reading all of these reviews just reminds me of why I'd never begin taking it ever again. Please check with your physician in reference to the various side effects prior to taking this drug. I think there should be a CLASS ACTION suit against the drug Depakote!!

The Keppra made me sleep all day for days. I've been off it for several months and have finally stop getting so sleepy.  The doctor said it is out of my system, but I still get sleeply a little. I have my liver and other tests done twice a year, and so far I've been blessed with no problems.  I have broken out with white spots that I was afraid was an allergy to Depakote or was vitiligo.

He also has sleep apnea that brought on seizures after several seizure free years (atleast grand mal seizures) After being put in a coma to stop seizures he was put on depakote, this drug has dimenished his capacity for a normal life.  It stopped the seizures however, he has no guality of life at all, he shuffles, falls, get's confused and sleeps all the time.  He went from playing ball each and every day to having the inablity to throw a ball at all.  He shakes uncontrollabley and is cold all the time.  He has to have his blood level checked as well because of the medication.  We have seen his Nuerologist and GP, and know one seems to want to change anything.  He also has bathroom accidents. He is required to take 3000 mg of the medication daily.  This man went from active gardner, took care of lawns and played with his grandchildren continuously to a person that sleeps all day, can't walk unassisted and gets confussed very easily.  We will continue to look for different avenues and may have to result in taking him out of our city to another city for help.  It breaks our families heart to watch such a strong man become such a sad weak man that can barely hold a spoon. Really check out your doctor and drug prescriptions.

She lives in a retirement community with a level 2 condition of care (not assisted or Altzheimers). She is outgoing , walks slowly with a three wheeler and has a smile most of the time.  
Mos was given Depakote while at a local hospital for treatment of a ""near collapse condition"" with low blood pressure,gastointestinal infection   and heart irregularities.
 She was treated successfully over about 10 days and released back to her senior living residence. 
At the dinner table she quickly became agitated, yelling out her name continually. She was also counting repeatedly and with determination. She was usually calm and peaceful before all of this reaction. 
It turns out that the hospital had been giving her Depakote successfully. The residence nurse and manager did not track with that and the  Depakote  was mistakenly not continued. We, the family, discovered the error by a tip and notified the management who quickly restored the Depakote. Mom's condition improved like a miracle.  She is still on a mild dose and is loving and cheerful again. 
Be cautious of long term dosages.

I haven't started it yet, but have to let people know about my migraines. They started when I was 4 (now I am 40) I suffered severely until about 10 years ago. I was then prescribed ELAVIL! It changed my life. Hardly ever get the migraines. Started on low dose, slowly increased to 50 mgs.Went up tp 100 mgs, but then had side effects, which I NEVER have at 50mgs. At 50 mgs, no side effects and almost no migraines. If you get migraines, TRY ELAVIL!!It was seriously life changing.

My father has been taking Depakote for 7 years, and I believe that it has given him Parkenson's Disease. The side effects listed on the warning label are identical to those of Parkenson's. When he began taking Depakote, he immediately had severely debilitating side effects. He had no energy, severe muscle weakness, dizzyness, and has not been able to do much except for sleep and sit in a chair all day. His muscles have almost completely atrophied and he is in a rehabilitation center trying to get enough strength in his muscles to be able to walk again. Right now, as a result of this medication, he is at the end stages of Parkenson's, which eventually results in death. Luckily, I figured out that he doesn't actually need to be taking any anti-convulsants at all, because he has been seizure free for 5 years now. I believe that his seizures were caused by a heart condition that he was diagnosed with 5 years ago called Atrial Fibrillation. We are now tapering him off of Depakote,(even though his doctor would not agree to it)and after only 3 weeks of a decrease in medication(from 1000mg/day to 750mg/day)in combination with physical therapy, my father's Parkenson's symptoms are actually reversing! Six weeks ago, we thought were going to loose him. His energy, strength and balance are now returning to him, and he is making remarkable strides on his road to recovery. My only advice to those with epilepsy is to find the cause, and treat from there. Seizures are a major warning sign that something is wrong. Medications  may control the episodes in the meantime, but in the long term you end up toxifying the body. Those toxins then buildup in your nervous system, and cause it to deteriorate. Meanwhile, your ""alarm system"" isn't going off anymore, and now you are headed for even more serious danger. You will have better luck curing the seizures if you find the cause and treat from there. Those w/nervous system problems should detox."

They put him on Depakote in dec of 08.  They had him on too much of the medicine and it was making him toxic and cause status eplieptus (sp).  I would like to first say to the lady who lost her son I am so sorry for your loss.  I'd also like to know if they checked his liver on a regular basis. They check my sons every two to four weeks due to the magnitude of side effects he has on this medication.  Thank you for your post it is very helpful in making sure they continue to do this.
602$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$3/7/2009 12:27:31 PM$Reviewer: vjn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I have been diagnosed as a manic/depressive for years, been through therapy, etc, and for the past 5 years just took 5 mg valium 4x day.  My doctor gave me this pill without checking any blood work, was not informed of side effects.  Took 1 250 mg pill yesterday and woke up this morning at 7 am, hands/face swollen, tremors, stomach cramps, exhausted, confused, blurry vision, heart racing....if this is for the manic phase, all it did was make it worse, and I had suicidal thoughts....I wouldn't take this pill (and it was to be increased to 3 per day)again.  I do not beleieve Dr's even listen to patients anymore, they seem to think a pill can cure anything.  I have other complications and need surgury, but they put all that off.  I'll just wait until I'm able to go take a walk again and dig in the dirt and plant a garden during a manic episode, but this was HORRIBLE.... life is too short, and I feel this would make my life even shorter.  Cannot even concentrate.

The medicine caused bad facial break-outs for about 4 years, but those stopped after I used proactiv, and then they generally stopped without it. I also gained weight for a couple of years-I'm thin anyway so it wasn't a terrible problem-but I am back to my normal weight now. My seizures were caused by a head injury in 2001, and I was having significant numbers of grand mal seizures after the injury. Depakote usually controls my seizures, but I still generally have 1 or 2 per year. I have had 6 seizures in the last year, and I am probably going to take my full 1000mg per day, but there are some mental and physical side effects-it is hard to decide if I should take my full dosage and I am having money problems so it is hard to see my doctor to discuss this with him (I am currently on the patient assistance program.) I can say that I was taking effexor that controlled my panic disorder, and the increased seizures started after I began taking that medication. I am currently not taking it because while it did stop my panic attacks, there were the increased seizures, and sexual side effects that the effexor had on me.

I take 500mg. just before bedtime. I am supposed to take 1000mg.,however I am trying to take least as possible to prolong the introduction of known side effects (weight gain, hair loss,liver&pancreas damage etc.)Migraines are minimal and the convulsive seizure activity that would accompany the migraines afterward during sleep have stopped completely. My brain doesn't seem to race all the time. I am a business owner and this has helped to settle my brain from so much unnecessary worry and also allows for some great restful sleep. I would recommend if you take at 8pm., try to get 7 hours sleep. You will feel like a champ when you get out of the shower the next morning.

She suffered her first migrane only 2 months before. Tried some of the other meds (triptane) but b/c of slow heart rate (since birth) couldn's use the propanolol type meds. After 6 days in hospital (dr. did a lp w/o success & b/c of pain to back/head she had to go to er). Her new dr. has her on the Depakote. She is having the nausea and is really sleepy but so far this is the only side effect. She is on 500mg,am&pm; her dr. also has her on Amitriptyline 10mg in p.m. Anyone out there using this combination? if so, how is it working and any side effects? This has been such a tramatic experience for us! All your comments are greatly appreciated. Until her first migrane episode in early Dec, she was completley healthy. She has not been able to go to school; the migranes have completely changed her life and our entire family.

I always knew with the psychiatric drugs, there is a decrease in libido, but my libido became pretty much non-existent and never really came back the entire time I was on the medication.  It felt like I just sort of existed and not much else.  I was extremely passive and gained a substantial amount of weight. In addition to all this, I seemed to have a creative block and a lack of interest in anything.  It felt like I was in a consistent lull.  I tried adjusting my dose with the help of y psychiatrist, but I had the same effects. I even tried adjusting when I took my medication and how I took it.  I tried taking it with food and without food.   With water and then tried taking it with a full glass of milk. Nothing changed and so I eventually, against medical advice, went off of the medication  (all of them).

I think it's due to increase in appetite. Was overweight... not bad but did bother me.. hair loss... not that bad but i did notice it. ended up with cysts in ovaries last year.. treated the cysts with birth control and it went away, but i'm assuming it came back since my heavy non-stopping period came back when i stopped birth control... 
i recently (2 weeks) switched to Keppra and although am still feeling the side effects, i have lost 22 lbs and am still loosing weight BY THE DAY!! Have lost some appetite, which is fine with me-- it's not that i'm not eating at all, i just eat less or enough for my body... my period stopped about 2/3 days ago...although i'm not sure if it's because of the Keppra or because I stopped taking Depakote or because the cysts are gone... will have to see if i start having regular periods next month.
all and all, i hated this drug...  it did keep me from having regular seizures-- i did have like 1 seizure in maybe 6-8 months, but the side effects really sucked..."

I am 100% permanently and fully disabled for migraine headaches, for the rest of my life, and have been, for many, many years now... and Depakote has been one of the few meds that my doc. has kept me on, because of the neurotransmitter effect that ties in with the migraines... read up here on WebMD on Depakote, and it will tell you all about the neurotransmitters and how they affect migraine headaches... and Depakote happens to be one of the drugs that deals with those neurotransmitters, putting them in the proper balance, and therefore, relieving the migraine(s) before they even occur for the patient. (us!)  So anyway, that's how I understand it on my end, after just reading up on it... feel free to read up on it yourself in these pages... my biological mother died of an anneurysm when I was only 4 yrs. old and she was 27 so it runs in my family... she too, had terrible, daily migraine headaches, as I have had for many, many years. Depakote has been working for me, for the entire time I've taken it, and I don't see anything wrong with it.  That's my opinion and my experience with this particular medication. I hope this can be of help to some other people out there.

All of the side effects from previous drugs made it harder to deal with than bi-polar itself.  Her doctor then had her start depakote last fall and she did well for a month and half so he doubled it..not sure why. Then she started having the shakes real bad and would be dizzy and stmbled into to things. We were so worried she would break a hip. The doctor pulled her off of it for a couple weeks then started her back to original dose and she's do better. She still tends to feel a little loopy from the meds...but we all agree (her included) that is better than the ups and downs of bi-polar. Treating any depression is so tricky as everyone's body chemistry is different. It takes patience and love and a very good support system for folks suffering.  God bless anyone who has a loved one or is dealing with this themselves.

I went through several psychiatrists before I found this one who has been wonderful in listening to me and altering my treatment plan to deal with unwanted side effects of other medications.  The main thing that I have not liked about Depakote is the weight gain.  I feel like I'm starving (literally) all the time and have increased appetite because of it.  Overall, though, I would recommend it.  I do believe that if you still have symptoms if on Depakote, ask your doctor because I have NO symptoms at all when coupled with the other mood stabilizer I am on.

Depakote combined with adequate nutrition and exercise is the ultimate treatment for my bipolar dis order.People need to realize that medication alone will not provide them the best results. The worst thing about the depakote for me, is occasionally I have very blury vision. People are complaining about the weight gain due to depakote this has not been true for me.Without the sucess of depakote I could not be persuing a nursing career.

I have had no side effects from this medication, except for the time I attempted to follow a low carbohydrate diet, during which time my liver started to shut down. DON'T attempt the low carbohydrate diet to try to lose weight if you are taking Depakote.

I've been on it for one full week and have felt very little physical side effects and my mood has leveled out to normalcy. I am worried about the long term effects but so far so good. The only side effects I have experienced is loss of appetite (very subtle) and a shorter but more efficient sleep pattern. I will only sleep 4-5 hours at a time but feel well rested. That could be due to the combination with the Wellbutrin. Overall, it's been a lifesaver

After 1 1/2 years I moved out of state, was rediagnosed Bipolar, and with reservation was switched to Depakote with an antidepressant (Olanzapine).

I've experienced good results after 2 years of treatment with Depakote. The side effects are somewhat troubling (i.e. listlessness and weight gain), however the alternative, a recurrance of an extreme manic episode, vastly 'outweights' (pun intended) these effects. My biggest concern with the medication is that I do feel a significant suppression of my creative side.

I was misdiagnosed and mistreated for depression most of my adult life. After 5 days of taking DepakoteER I have noticed a big change. I am a rapid cycling bipolar (minutes not days and hours) I have noticed increased appetite, sex drive and enjoy time with my family that I have not had in 36 years of my life. I am calm, collected and NOT exhausted from my mania. Also, my depression now just a slight sadness that quickly disperses without much effort. I can now laugh and mean it, it isn't just the ""appropriate response"". This includes the smiling and the crying. I am no longer in the ""fog"" of BP but a REAL person with REAL reactions. I would take the side effects and risks to remain this way. I am a person for the first time in my life.
When I began the medication, the first three days were a little rough with the changes my body made (urinating every hour, thirst and frequent bowel movements) but as the drug levels out, my body responds more normally now. I hope this post helps some of you. This drug has helped with my mania AND depression. "
