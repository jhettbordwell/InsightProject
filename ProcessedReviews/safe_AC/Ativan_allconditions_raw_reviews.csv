Use it for calming brain down so I can sleep, or when Iâ??m nervous about something. Donâ??t use very often because very hard to get from Dr. so I have to limit my usage. But if it was up to me and easier to get Iâ??d take 1 pill every day. Sure takes the edge off .

Do not stay on this drug for more than a month!!  I was unfortunate that I had a really stupid, ignorant family doctor (Dr. THOMAS LUNDSTEN, ST.

I took .5 mg for 3 months for insomnia and two weeks later after stopping it, I am still having trouble standing in the shower and walking.  Insomnia is back big-time and the headaches are beyond brutal. I have already had unnecessary medical tests because of the side effects it caused while still taking it.  I am sorry I just didn't put 2 and 2 together earlier on. Still so afraid because I know I'm no where out of the woods yet from what I've read and from what I am experiencing.  I know I should taper; but I am petrified to have any more of this poison in me.  FDA says it can be harder to kick than heroin-why is it still so available?  Do something besides printing leaflets FDA!!!

It was taken in combination with Welbutrin for depression. Do not take these two together..the ativan made him have body tremors, nervousness, and horrible suicidal thoughts.

It has worked better than any of the 9 or 12 they've me in over many, many years. I've been on threes time for 15  years, with no problems stopping when I need to for surgery etc. Lately there's a new black box warning out about this and oxys, but I've been taking them together for years now with no problem... sooooooooo, now my doctor says she can't give them to me anymore so I'm off them for two weeks, and in that time I've slept 2 nights through.

I found it was great for my chronic sleeping problem also. Great sleep for 5 or 6 hours with no hang over, like most sleeping pills. Also I recently quit drinking after 40 years.

16$Condition: Anxious$1/31/2017 9:43:13 AM$Reviewer: Polinda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$An excellent medication, out of all meds I tried none were as effective for managing my PTSD symptoms. Completely prevented flashbacks and nightmares and anxiety at night and allowed me to fall asleep very calmly. However I can't give it a 10 because I gained tolerance to the doses incredibly quickly, meaning I had to keep raising the dose to get the same effect, which is dangerous because it is a drug you can become physically addicted to. I would highly recommend this med to those seeking a short term fix while they are becoming stable on another long term med, but would not recommend it as a long term fix due to tolerance and addiction possibilities. I bought Ativan here https://drugstoresale24hss.com/ativan. Maybe my review helpes somebody! 
17$Condition: Anxious$1/24/2017 9:34:51 PM$Reviewer: NunYa, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$Worked great at first.  Then my behavior got erratic (like flooring my car to 70 mph in 25 mph zones for no reason).  Started getting irritable and shaky between doses.  Realized I had gotten hooked off 1 mg, 3 times a day for a month and half.  Tried to get off it and doctors were next to useless.  Went to ER with full-blown convulsions/muscle spasms and doctor told me it was the worst case of withdrawal he had seen in 14 years, and that I would die of a heart attack, relapse and start taking it again, or become an alcoholic.  6 years later I'm still alive, drink once or twice a week, and haven't taken any benzos since the day after my ER visit.  Be safe about it, but don't listen to doctors who tell you that you have to keep taking it forever, find one who will help taper you off.  Be strong, you CAN do it, and you'll be better off for it.     
18$Condition: Muscle Spasm$1/17/2017 11:15:08 PM$Reviewer: Charlize, 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I was given this medicine when I was at the hospital and I was really nervous and was having kind of an anxiety attack so the doctor gave me it to calm me down. AT the time i was also at the hospital because I was having a weird right facial spasm that gave me headaches daily. The doctor gave me 2 mg when I was getting something done ,then they noticed my twitching stopped. At the time they couldn't figure out the cure for my facial spams so when they noticed that it had temporarily stopped my twitching, they were immediately intrigued and told us to take it for a bit until they find an actual cure. Later on, i have been taking 2 mg of attivan and it had made me really sleepy and it made it hard to stay away in school. Months later, they reduced the dosage to 1 mg, and it made me less sleepy but still same side effects. even though i refused to admit it, it made me forgetful, although it made me really relaxed, etc., and it did change my mood a lot based from what my family said. I would think i get headaches if i wasn't on it, I was taking it daily btw. Now coming off of it , it did have bad withdrawal symptoms my mood was completely messed up, it made me sad at times, however i was never mad, just crying but that was because i had a lot going on however i know the medicine did not totally help me either. I wouldn't say the medicine is bad because I'm pretty sure if u have anxiety and etc. this medicine would help a lot HOWEVER TAKE IN GOOD CONSIDERATION THAT THIS IS ADDICTING , AND U MIGHT BE ADDICTED AND NOT EVEN BE AWARE.

Does not help with anxiety.  Withdrawal is extremely painful and unbearable.  Can't see how anyone could possibly be satisfied with this poison to the body.  It only hooks you and then you cannot get off it without excruciating pain all day and night long. Doctor will not tell you how addicting it is.  You don't take it because you want it; only to not die because of possible seizures in withdrawal.  EXTREME PAIN, NO SLEEP BECAUSE OF PAIN, NO QUALITY OF LIFE.

It worked great -- but after about 9 years, it seemed to ""turn"" on me. I began waking up with killer headaches and experienced fogginess and abdominal symptoms. The symptoms became incapacitating, and now am attempting to slowing taper off of Ativan -- which I KNOW is the culprit, whether doctors believe it is or not. The withdrawal process is very difficult with the physical symptoms and the psychological fear, especially without much support."

30$Condition: Anxious$11/15/2015 7:03:12 PM$Reviewer: JoeC, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years$5$3$5$This drug works like a miracle to calm my anxiety when needed. Within an hour I can go from a state of near paranoia to total relaxation and ease with the world around me, a temporary transformation to an extrovert even. But it is highly addictive and use must be strictly regulated. It's so easy to want to use it again and again: I try not to use it more than once a week. The problem is that if I slip and start using for a couple days in a row I become dependent and need more to make it work. By the time I've realized I'm hooked and stop the side affects kick in: even worse anxiety than before, trouble sleeping, no energy, no motivation. Overall an excellent medication but must be used with discipline.

I recently switched to the sublingual tablets because I found waiting a half hour for it to kick in was often really unpleasant. The downside of that is now I have tiny tiny tiny 1mg tablets, I'd usually break my 1mg tablets in half, but it's hard to do with these ones even with my tiny elf hands, and they're really easy to lose. I'm not sure if they last quite as long as the non-sublingual tablets, but they kick in much faster, usually only a few minutes.   I find the side effects vary from day to day,  occasional dizziness or unsteadiness, occasional mild hallucinations if I take more than 1mg at once, sometimes a really high sex drive, sometimes a really sad weird nostalgic feeling. It seems to increase the effects of alcohol, which sounds desirable but is almost always accompanied by extreme drowsiness. Also I think it might be making my hair fall out, but theres a lot of factors that could be contributing to that.

39$Condition: Anxious$6/23/2015 1:25:06 AM$Reviewer: ojitos, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I was diagnosed with high anxiety. I would wake up in the morning ready to conquer the world ten times over. I would so fast that my family would tell me to calm down. Sometimes I couldn't keep up with myself. I was prescribed 0.5 mg Ativan 2x per day As Needed. This medication is not meant to be taken every single day. Even at the speed I was going, I did not need this medicine every day. If you find you need to take this medication every day, then you should ask for another medication. I was told by my doctor that Wellbutrin helps with anxiety but also with appetite control. The only issue was I would have had to wait 4-6 weeks for it to kick in. We should always police ourselves and watch what we are putting in our mouths and how often, especially medication. Several doctors did not feel comfortable prescribing this drug and I didn't understand why when it was on the formulary at my doctor's office. This is truly the only medication that I found that doesn't cause libido issues and that I can take when needed, not every single day. Most medications made me feel out of my element and thus not myself. The Ativan takes the edge off but helps slow me down so I am not going 100 mph. If you feel like you are starting to become addicted or are addicted, seek help. Don't put yourself in that situation. Be true to yourself. Always!
40$Condition: Anxious$6/21/2015 6:14:16 PM$Reviewer: Steph, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$1$5$Ativan worked very well for me in regards to my sleep anxiety. I would take it occasionally when i had troubles sleeping and would get all worried about it. On average, I was probably taking about 2-3 mg a week. Unfortunately, after about 8 months I started developing horrible headaches, insomnia, memory loss and fatigue. I felt shitty all day long and my symptoms would only clear up if I stopped taking Ativan for about a week. If I took even 1 mg again, the symptoms would all come back. DO NOT TAKE Ativan if you are young (I'm 22) ! Psychological help (counselors, therapists etc.) are much more helpful in the long run and they don't mess up your body the way that so many prescription drugs can! If you are thinking of taking Ativan, I would highly recommend you not doing so if you are young and psychotherapy is an option.

The world became cruel and dangerous.  My wife went back to work. and I became the protector. Inseparable, feeling like I wasn't doing enough to keep him safe insomnia from panic attacks lasting days becoming more and more severe. I was a danger to my son and myself.  Ativan, what can I say, I was in such bad shape I could not go outside and freaked when my wife would take him places, I would force myself to go along. I could not stay home not knowing what was happening. The effect of the medication was almost immediate.  Having a physically calming affect. I could once again begin to think clearly giving up the feeling of possible attack around every corner. As my son became aware of his surroundings. being able to pay attention to him, he brought back just how wonderful life can be. Ativan is the first prescribed medicine other than antibiotics. I had ever had.  I can't imagine what could have happened the downward spiral I was in. My prescription was written ""as needed"" I had refused to take anything on a regular basis.  With time the attacks became less severe and less frequent. Manifesting themselves in irritatingly mundane situations. Few and far between my attacks are, my son now 16, and medicated for bi-polar disorder, I am doing well. passion without fear."

Although it does have potential for abuse like others, unlike Xanax, Ativan is a fast acting yet smooth panic reliever that works smoothly on the way and down. I highly recommend you take Ativan before ever trying its rival, Xanax.

It was so intense and it continued for several days. It was so intense my wife took me to the ER. She thought I might be having a heart attack. Could catch my breath, could barely walk, had to be rolled into the ER by a couple of paramedics. They kept me overnight. Set up a heart cath, and put me on Lipitor and Ativan. Went back to work the next day after my release. The attacks never went away. One day at work I had a major anxiety ... major. I turned to my boss and said I can't do this anymore and resigned on the spot. I worked for USPS. Pay around $60 thousand plus. I have a wife and a 10 year old. boy. My postmaster put me down as retiring and I thank her for that. I'm still waiting for HR to complete my retirement package. I applied for Social Security and got it ... I'm 63. The attacks are still there. I also suffer from MDD, ADHD, and deal with insomnia frequently. I walked away from a really good job. I have never been that irresponsible in my life. I've jepardized my families well-being. I very seldom go out ... Only when I  absolutly have to. My depression has gotten worse. Ativan helps a little, but that's all. I still cannot believe I walked away from a great job. Unbelievable ... really."

I usually have refills on this script, but when I'm out of refills, my doctor takes forever to contact the pharmacy. I did not sleep more than a couple miserable hours every other night for 6 days. Other than that, I highly recommend this medication over xanax and valium. It lasts for 8 hours, as opposed to the 3 hours of valium, and xanax just seems to get you high and is highly addictive. Long term use of Ativan does cause memory loss and is physically addictive. Restless body syndrome is another withdrawal symptom.  I think I will be on this medication the rest of my life, along with Oxycodone, Gabapentin, Meloxicam and Roboxin. The best advice is don't even start taking any benzodiazepine at all. There's gotta be a better way to deal with anxiety.

Only getting worse, I was recently diagnosed with lupus and fibromyalgia.  Anyway, about 6 months ago something happened and my pain in my back was so intense I had to go to the ER.  The first time they gave me valium and hydrocodone.  Did nothing for me, but keep me awake for about 36 hours (I don't do well with hydrocodone).  The next day, I had to go back to the ER! My pain was so bad it was in my chest, It really felt like my heart or something.  They setup an IV and gave me ativan - I have tried in the past EVERY muscle relaxer on the market, name it, its in my medicine cabinet, still full because they don't work on me.  THIS WORKED. I stopped and looked at the nurse and said ""What was that? I need to know what this is. I'm not hurting right now"" Ativan does for me what Soma, Flexiril, Valium, Zanaflex, robaxin, any of it - Ativan does what they can't do for me.  
Ativan isn't for everyone, but when you've tried everything and nothing has worked, this is worth a shot.  I take 1MG every night before I go to bed, and my pain is controlled. Does your body become dependent on it?  So I read.  It is worth it to me, to control my pain and become dependent on this drug with such minimal side effects.  What quality of life do I have with the pain I had before ativan? Ativan is my miracle drug."

I became seriously depressed, and, though I always had problems with anxiety, they only got worse, especially my insomnia.  I absolutely could not sleep, or, if I did, I would wake up in a panic.  My anxiety increased so much I couldn't drive in tunnels, go into a carwash, even fly on an airplane.  Sometimes the attacks would happen when I was sitting at a red light in a major intersection and it took every ounce of strength not to get out of my car and run across the traffic.  It was terrible. It got so bad one time I went to the ER, and, after an allergic reaction to an anti-nausea medicine they gave me, they then gave me Ativan in IV form.  I felt like a calm just washed over me and fell a sleep. I asked my Dr. if he could prescribe it for  me afterwards.  That was 7 years ago and I still take it every night. I rarely take it during the day, as my anxiety attacks seem to have lessened, but do take anywhere from .5 to 1 mg each night before bed. I know I am addicted but don't really care.  I am at least able to function okay now and lead a somewhat normal life.  I think it is a godsend. I will also add that I tried everything else the experts say, I am an avid exerciser, don't drink much caffeine, and drink very little alcohol.  I also meditate regularly and make sure I read before bed to calm me. I still will wake up panicky though if I don't take it so always end up relying on my Ativan.  I think like any drug, you need to be wise about it and weigh the consequences of taking it against the consequences of not taking it.

I try to keep a little on hand at all times. I was given some during my chemotherapy treatments.  That was the only time I experienced a side effect but I did not realize it immediately. That is, although I acted perfectly normal, when I woke up the next day, I could not remember anything that occurred after the treatment started!  I found out about it in a funny way. Before a treatment, I went in to a store with the friend who brought me. We agreed to return after the treatment.  Apparently we did and I considered making a significant purchase.  My friend convinced me to think it over until the next day.  She then called to see if I decided to buy the ring.  I had no recollection of the second visit nor my possible purchase.  I did several tests after that with the same results - no recollection of anything I did or said for the rest of the day after a chemo treatment.  A nurse advised that it was the ativan.

Many severe side effects unrecognized by 8 doctors in 3 hospitals. All docs seem to think safe as candy. No matter what the dose you will go through withdrawal if you stop cold turkey. You just don't know yet that you are addicted.
It is prescribed to women twice as often as men. Largest group on Ativan is women over 60. Why? 1/3 of nursing home residents in the US receive a benzodiazepine. 5x increase in memory & concentration. 4x risk of daytime fatigue. 2x risk of falls and fractures of hip and wrist. 2x risk of car accident when driving. Problems with urine. Long term use slowly dulls your brain and erases your personality and sense of self. Lungs ached & felt like I had the flu for 2 years. Onco did not know the side effects of a drug she loves to prescribe without any idea of the consequences. How can this be when the information is all over the internet about the dangers of rapid withdrawal. www.benzobuddies.org may be able to help you see what you are doing to yourself with the help of your prescribing doctor. He is not helping you. Ativan is supposed to be used for only 2-4 weeks not forever. It accumulates in the brain. The older you are the more slowly your brain can process the drug. 6-18 months withdrawal physically. The longer you take it the longer it takes to get off the drug. Up to a year or more for your brain to recover if it ever does. I thought addiction meant I would want more and more. I took the med as directed so thought there was no problem. WRONG! You don't have any idea you are addicted until you try to stop. I didn't abuse this drug. This drug abused my entire brain and body. It will do the same to you. If you don't believe me watch the lorazepam withdrawal videos on youtube. More people who are suffering due to doctors' prescriptions taken faithfully. 1/3 of nursing home patients get a benzo. They give it for the dementia it causes in the first place. Why Why Why"

I have severe anxiety disorder which interferes with my work and school. After 2.5 years of not drinking I went back to it as a quick fix for the anxiety. Years earlier they knew I had anxiety but tried to put me on anti-depressants.  A therapist during a hospital stay for alcoholism evaluated me along with my PCP and they said I'm not depressed, just anxious and think Ativan which I was receiving for withdraw would be best for me. I went from 1 mg 3x a day to 1 in the A.M, 1 in the P.M and 2 b4 bed. As of today I'm at 2 in the A.M, 1 in the P.M and 2 b4 bed.  So far it's been working very well, I'm less agitated.  In the hospital they paired it with Valium and may do so again or with Klonopin was talked about.  Ativan helps me sleep, calm down, I have a highly stressful job in finance. I wake up after the 2 feeling tired, a little, but it wears off pretty soon after awaking.  Good medicine!

I read about all the terrible things that happened to people while on Ativan, and to be honest I haven't had any of the problems people say it caused. Back in Aug I was diagnosed GAD and my doctor prescribed to me Ativan .5mg to help cope with my anxiety. I started out at 2mg per day for the first week, but then felt good enough to drop that to 1.5mg and then to just 1mg by week three. By week 4 I was down to .5mg only at night, which is where I'm at right now. I'll be dropping it down to .3 by the end of next week. Ativan has been the ONLY anxiety drug I've taken lately that hasn't tried to kill me. Celexa even at a small dosage gave me the early symptoms of serotonin syndrome. Buspar made me incredibly ill, but my .5 Ativan helps me sleep in a pinch. I'm not keen on staying on this benzo, however if I need to, I think I'll move to Klonopin. In the end my experience has been more than pleasant, and as I'm gradually tapering off the drug, I haven't had really any nasty side effects. As my doctor told me, most of the horror stories are caused by people who didn't follow instructions. Didn't take the drug as prescribed, and or expected the drug to resolve the anxiety issues. As my doc says, the drug helps you do 25% of the work, but it's up to you to resolve the rest of the 75%. This drug isn't for everybody, especially those with drug addiction issues, but if you take it just as the doctor instructs and go in with the mindset to taper yourself off, then I highly recommend it (at least for a short period of time (no more than three months)

It defiantly helps calm me down at a higher dose (4-6mg) and helps me sleep at a lower dose (1-2mg). The only trouble I have is finding a doctor that will continue to prescribe it to me. I've heard it can be very addictive but I stopped taking it for a few months and felt no withdrawal, just anxious and tired (obviously). Overall I love Ativan. I've been taking it for about one year now and will continue to take it to help with my anxiety.

It was stopped, no side effects at all, I now have extreme anxiety / panic attacks possibly late on-set due to cancer and chemo, it is not working at all....I will eventually be put on another anti anxiety drug.

When she has overwhelming anxiety she takes one pill.  If she feels ok she will skip a day.  It takes 20-25 minutes to take effect and this low dosage returns her to normal.  It is very consistent as to when it kicks in.  This gives her a minimum of 4 hours of relief.  The effect appears to go away after 4 hours but because she broken the cycle of her anxiety she may be better the rest of the day.  The reason for the low dosage, taking only when she needs it and only once a day is a fear of addiction.

Your tolerance builds significantly faster than opiates if you up your dosage or take more than recomended.

While in CCU, the nurses gave him 1 mg every 3-4 hrs in his IV so he would sleep, otherwise he would lie awake all night and bug them. As soon as it was pushed in his IV, he fell right asleep in about 5-10 minutes.  Now, at home, while recovering, we give it to him on some nights when he has insomnia, in the 1 mg pill format. The pill takes about 1-2 hours to make him feel anything at all - definitely not as effective as the IV formulation was. It doesn't make him feel sleepy, but it relaxes him enough that he will dose off. It does not keep him asleep, though - he wakes up every 2 hours or so throughout the night. We usually have to give him 2 doses about 5 hours apart. The second dose seems to have a much better effect on enabling him to sleep.  However, his cardiologist now wants him off the Ativan due to the addictive side effects, and has put him on Ambien to sleep instead.  The Ambien doesn't seem to do much of anything for him. I would say the Ativan is a good drug if you are keyed up, restless feeling or have anxiety, simply to calm you. I doesn't seem to make my dad fuzzy headed or unable to function after he wakes up, so that is good.  He is 63, 5'11 and 330 pounds, so perhaps the 1mg pill is too weak for a man of his size. We will try some other natural remedies to help him sleep so he doesn't need to Ativan as much.

They tried me on other medications but they always made me feel loopey.  My life was destroyed by my mental illness but when they put me on ativan the tension, heaviness in my heart, the shaking and feeling like my life was over all went away.  I was back to being myself again and have ever since.  Sure I have some bad days but don't we all.  Just to live normal again and not have the fear in your heart or in your head is worth it to me.  You need to take your meds as prescribed and don't increase the meds or drink alcohol with them.  I have been blessed they finally did find something to help me live a more normal life.  All meds work differently on people so just work with your doctor and what works for you to be a normal person again is what it's all about.

So far, the generic lorazepam has worked well with no noticeable side effects. Almost immediate relief from an impending panic attack is achieved.

It's great for a quick panic attack of if you need to be in a crowd of people. It doesn't get you 'high' unless you abuse if profusely. Just beware if you do choose to overdo this drug. It is capable of competely stopping your heard rate because your body becomes so relaxed. Only take as prescribed. Even as prscribed you will get the same effect, just at a slower pace. 

I have been on Ativan for about 4 months now an it helps quite a lot when i need to meet new people. I almost fear ""Fearless"". I will just walk up to someone and introduce myself  and strike up a conversation. 

In a work environment you become more productive. You no longer feel like you are 'dragging ass' the entire day just waiting for it to be over. 

Only think i worry about is dependance. Get yourself  good support system. Family is the best since they know you more. I also have my Doctor and therapist to keep an eye on me. I suggest many of you can do the same if possible.

I take Buspar regularly, and then Ativan, as needed, and it helps for those breakthrough anxiety moments.  It is addicting though and you will build up a tolerance.  I find that 0.5mg does not work as well as it used to.  I normally take about once a day in the evening as it seems my anxiety is worse then, and it helps me sleep also.

Sometimes it feels like the drug takes up to an hour to take affect, but once it does I feel great. When I am really anxious, I feel the effects more quickly, within 15 minutes. I only take them when I feel anxious, and it usually helps my anxiety go away long enough for me to deal with my problems, so I never feel myself ""coming down"" from it.

I started taking 0.5 mg 3Xs a day after being kidnapped, beaten and threatened to be shot. I was diagnosed with PTSD.  This medication helped me get my life back together.  I too did not feel that I was addicted, until my new doctor advised me to stop taking it. He felt that at age 64 the medication would continue to cause problems with my balance and would end up causing additional problems. It would be easier to get off of it now than later.  Even though he has been taking me off slowly, I have had really bad side effects.  Believe me, this is an addictive drug!  While it helped me deal with my problems initially, it also caused me problems.  I do have issues with my balance and took a nasty fall (for no apparent reason)a few years ago.

I was struggeling with Chronically severe anxiety (Always thinking I was about to die do to my heart, and other many many Illogical fears) And tried an assortment of medications that did almost nothing.

2MG of this pill (2MG for my weight - 185) worked amazing.

It does Indeed calm you down, but not that ""I'm high"" feeling or ""I'm so tired I just want to sleep"" feeling.

This medicine made me feel ""normal"" for once. Though getting this medicine may be extremely hard to do, you might be extremely happy that you tried.

If you're taking any of the Benzo's (Klonpopin, Xanax, Buspar ect) then this medication should never cause you to withdrawl.

However, It can become ""mentally abused"" by which It's you new ""Emergency medicine"" and if you run out, why you may not be withdrawing being out can easily send you into a massive chain of panic attacks.

Please ween yourself off of this medicine as It produced visions, night tremors ect for myself.

Please do not abuse It either as It directly effects the brain, be careful.


The normal dose Is 1MG 2x a day.

Some people MIGHT take 1MG 3x a day.

Some people MIGHT take 2MG 1x a day, or, 2x a day If they can handle It (Tollerance)



Taking this medicine for myself Has prooven to remove 100% of my anxiety and fear for about 1 hour, or so. Extremely effectly In my opinion and is very affordable."

When I had that panic attack I remembered feeling the exact same TERROR, when I was a young child, maybe 5 or 6. I've been coping w/it my whole life; not a good test taker, always shy and to myself, then later in life did the drinking and other stuff to get me numb... it just wasn't working. My doc prescribed Ativan (.5mg up to 4x a day) right away, along with Zoloft. It's been one year, and although I do have mini attacks now and again, I am in control - I take .5mg and within minutes I am better. I have never actually taken the full 2mg a day. This drug has saved my life... my relationships, my job... and I now enjoy life like I know I should.

Then one day going to work I couldnt breath felt like I was suffucating. 

My doctor gave me a prescriptian of Ativan. Told me to try it at home to see how I react to it prior to taking it at work with an attack and to only take it with an attack. Tried it for 3 days. Every time with in 45 minutes of taking it I was passed out, unable to function there is no possible way I could take this at work. My doctor switched my med to Xanax, so far it is helping with out knocking me out.

Excellent for panic but highly addicting. listen to others w/ experience w/ this drug...yes it works, but too well. i also suffer from OCD, and because of it's high addictive profile it's the wrong thing 4some1 like me to be on. The craving you get are horrible. If you can, please don't start using. Ask your Psych about  Buspar, natural remedies (Homeopathy) to releive anxiety. Take 5htp, or melatonin at night. See if calcium ingestion at night helps you sleep. There's a reason Dr's out there don't like to prescribe this, but other's unfortunately are too quick w/the pen. Remember you have choices. Don't despair and god bless. don't add addiction to your list of problems.

When you finally realize how it has caused memory loss of precious moments of life and worse symptoms than before taking the drug you'll find out how addictive it is. It makes a person a slave to the medication. A fear comes over one...""what if my doctor stopped prescribing this?"". You can't help but feel that the pharmaceutical company making this is nothing more than a dealer and you are ""hooked"" on a ""drug"".  After over 20 years on this I am here to say it is possible to quit taking it. It must be done slowly and decreased without cheating. You can be a ""human"" with feelings again. No need to be a ""zombie"" just functioning on ""auto"". In a literal physical way ""feeling"" has returned. Being alive again with all the pains of reality is so much better. If you are out there trying to quit ativan, stick to it. You will succeed. I am proof you can. "

Before that I used Librium for panic disorder but eventually stopped using it with the instant result of insomnia.  After a few years of insomnia I tried many medications to help and finally came across Ativan which instantly helped.  I have used Ativan ever since and occasionally use during the day when feeling extreme anxious.  I feel I will have to use this for the rest of my life.  I am now 69 years old.  Started using Librium at 21.

352$Condition: Tension Headache$5/22/2010 3:13:16 PM$Reviewer: Stepher, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I have to say that I have had bad headaches since i was 16yo and i am now 30.  After getting a MRI and years of trying to find a causes i found that if i took something that relaxed me and layed on a heating pad for about 30min i would feel better. Tylenol made then worse and ibuprophen made me sick...Long story short. My Dr has started me on Ativan 1 mgt 2x daily morning and afternoon (i am also now on amitryptiline 50mg at night) and i have noticed a MAJOR difference! I am nowhere near as anxious and once i started this med, after a few weeks i felt normal for the first time in YEARS. My mom has anxiety issues also, just hers come in panic attacks and mine is constant which causes major headaches.  I have a very stressful job as a dispatcher and 2 yound boys at home so i know stress and i have found that Ativan has given me my life back.  I do believe that eventually i will have to go up to something a little stronger but i am just relieved to have finally gotten some answers and relief from headaches that i had usually 5-6 times a week, sometimes lasting for days at a time. Now they are about 2x a weeks if that...Life is better now than it has been in a long time :)

This is a med you have to use daily not as a prn. Xanax is better for prn use since it hits harder than Ativan. Ativan does work with my extreme anxiety, but not so much with my panic attacks. Xanax works better for that. I haven't experience any complications and i've been on it (1mg ativan) for 3 months now :]

She is 93 and never had to take drugs except atenolol.  She broke her ankle and needed to be confined to bed so nursing home doctor prescribed ativan as well as pain medication to keep her in bed.  Could not stay awake and started talking gibberish and was totally out of it.  We were sure she had had a stroke.  Was sent to ER where they did CAT scan and blook work.  ER physician said it was absolutely not a drug to be given to older people as it affected their balance and their brains.  Hard lesson to learn but hope this keeps others from making same mistake.  Could have killed her, but she is again bright and cheery and in bed, thanks to family 24-hour surveillance.

(I was hitting myself and jerking so much it was horrible)

I was giving Ativan IM injection around 10:00 at night in the ER, which made me very drowsy, and made my vision blurr. I recall talking about how I saw 4 doctors, though I knew it was only a split in my vision.

I can't remember anything after lying down on the gurney, or the following day, other than what I've pieced together.

My parents were given a 'scrip for tablets, which they had filled immediately.

Well, we went home that night, and the following day, according to my parents, I became very agitated, to the point of physically ripping the clothing off of my body... (I'm glad I don't remember that) and clawed at myself, at which point my doctor told us to go to the ER and request admission to the pychiatric unit.

I didn't know what to think--I was terrified and watned to stop having these crazy movements and feel alittle calmer, and stop breaking things.

At the ER, I was physically restrained and given yet another dose of Ativan, at which point, I became delusional, and believed the ER staff were cannibals whom planned to eat me.

It took two days and several consultations with neurologists and psychologists to sort out the facts: I was a teenage girl with a movement disorder who had a severe psychotic reaction to Ativan....

pretty much, adn I went home, horrified at what had happened.  Taht's not all that transpired in the ER, but that's not the point.  

My point is this: it can do things to you.

Ativan made me psychotic.  It is very rare, but it has happened, and doctors may not always recognize this."

I rely on a mail-order service for my prescriptions & my Ativan refill was ""lost in the mail"" for a week.  During the dreadful cold turkey stage I gradually got numb & trembling extremities and trembling lower jaw.  I was convinced I had Lou Gehrigs Disease; I was convinced that if I got in my car to go to the ER I would get in an accident & die also.  Finally called a friend to take me to ER where they gave me a shot of Ativan & a temporary supply to last until my refill arrived.  It doesn't help my anxiety at all but I can't stop taking it due to the horrible withdrawl side effects.  "

387$Condition: Anxious$3/30/2010 4:12:04 AM$Reviewer:  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more$5$5$5$"I have been on Lorezapam (generic for Ativan) for about 12 years now. I have stopped taking it for periods of time (up to 3 months or more), but only wound up having acute panic attacks again and often hospitalized since some of my symtoms were considered life threatning. It is the only medication that has been able to prevent me from having acute anxiety attacks and some other health problems especially hypertension(the silent killer). The reason I would stop taking it was because of all the ""BS"" I heard about how harmful it could be and was very addictive and you would have to take more and more of it, not so with me!  I take 1 mg twice daily and it does the trick, I am able to function totally normal while taking this medication with NO SIDE EFFECTS!
I have been told by Doctor's that the 1 mg dose I take twice a day is considered a small dose and is not harmful to me and actually benefical for me to take because of the other health problems I have. Sometimes I will only take 1 MG daily and have NEVER taken more than 3 MG in one day.
From my personal experience with this medication, I would rank it right at the top if you need treatment for acute anxiety.
As for the treatment of anxiety before I started taking Lorezapam, THEY ALL FAILED!
Yes, I understand this is not the case for others, if you have suceeded my some other method, GREAT! But if you are going to need medication, myself I don't know of anything better. Doctor's have tried me on everthing else from just plain Aspirin and a night of good sex to Thorazine.

I have to laugh at all the medical experts who warn against long term use of ativan (and similar medications) suggesting patients will require larger and larger doses for effect when the exact opposite has been the case for me - the only side effect I experience is the relief of anxiety. I am now in excellent health, do not suffer from panic attacks nor any anxiety beyond the usual day to day stress, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this medication to anyone given my experience. I would rate it a class A medication in all respects!

Very scary!  I've never taken it since.  I lost an entire day and don't remember anything which is terrifying.  Obviously not the right medication for me.  I have since switched to a combination of Zoloft/Klonopin and my anxiety is almost non-existent.

It started with the left side of my chest becoming numb, then gradually got worse. Not knowing what to do I called my brother and he didn't answer. At this time I was still able to control my body and breathing. Trying to sit down and calm myself is the only thing I could think of. Then the pain kicked in. It literally felt like someone was holding a blow torch to my heart. I started the hyperventilate and my muscles tensed. I was scared, I thought that if I closed my eyes I was going to die. My sister in law took me to the hospital where upon arrival they took my vitals. Heart rate, 196, blood pressure, 140/90, neither one was good. They gave me a shot of liquid Ativan which calmed me down and took the pain away. When I went home I tried to sit down on the couch. As I stared in the distance the house came alive. Chairs were moving, chandelier talking, baby stroller walking. None of them were scary, but it was very weird. After doing some research I found out that haluccinations aren't on the side effect lest for Ativan. Can someone please help me to understand why my halluccinations occured?

I take .5mg 4x a day and dont always do this.  Its good to have the flexibility to take when needed and take one or two depending on severity.  I find less instances of anxiety and sleep is much better.  I did have my first real panic attack recently and chewing up 2 .5mg tablets calmed my heart rate down enough to get through the attack without making that expensive trip to the ER.  If you are only having mild to moderate anxiety this is a good one to try.  Like it a lot better than the SSRIs such as lexapro.

This drug is a nightmare yet a wonder drug at the same time.  I started taking it because I have multiple sclerosis and had muscle spasms.  That was 6 years ago.  I NEVER had anxiety before then.  It worked for the muscle spasms when nothing else would.  I tried neurontin (hallucinated), as well as all the muscle relaxants which just didn't touch it.  I knew this was a scary drug because my mother was a counselor and the doctor switched her from ativan (lorazepam) to ambien.  She began going through severe withdrawals.  She hallucinated, shook and had seizures.  They thought she was psychotic (she was and I tried to tell them why but they wouldn't listen), they put her on the psychiatric ward and gave her haldol.  Then she began to twitch and couldn't walk, half her face hung down (tardive dyskinesia).  They were ready to put her in a mental institution.  I begged them to listen to me, and even tried to sneak in ativan but I got caught.  She almost died before they gave her ativan.  Then she was back to normal.  It was truly a nightmare.  She had to move her practice to a different town.  She was so humiliated.  So, when I started taking it 6 years ago for my back, I was really careful.  Since then, and now I only take .5 to 1 mg at bedtime.  I went on a trip and forgot it.  I thought I would be fine.  By day 2 it was me this time.  I couldn't think, I was having horrible anxiety, and was scared out of my mind.  I drank a beer (I heard that helps a little), and it did some, but not enough. Finally I got the ativan and I got better.  Turns out, it doesn't matter how little you take, it's how long you take it.  Yes, it works wonders, but make sure you never run out, and if you start to have anxiety before your next dose, remember, it CAUSES anxiety too.  Just be very careful.  Dont take too much and let yourself run out.  Itcanbefatal

I was then diagnosed with Bipolar disorder as a young adult and it has really helped with that too. I usually take one at bedtime and then up to 2 others anytime throughout the day. Ativan has been a Godsend. But... if you are on a high dose it is imperative that you back down slowly- it can be very scary if you don't reduce usage one step at a time.

Currently, I am trying to wean myself off of the low dose I was taking, but still having some nagging withdrawal symptoms.  Dizziness, some shaking, etc. but will be worth it in the long run.

I took Xanax few times when I felt I was gonna have a panic attack, Since than it has been 5 months and I never had a panic attack. The pulkse on my neck has been dissapeared.

Finally, when the SRIs came out, I started Prozac, and found it help my overall mood, but, it had no effect on the sometimes debilitating worried feelings I've felt since child hood. After my divorce,I had a total mental collapse, with all of the terrifying and overwhelming physical and irrational mind trauma that accompanies a classic ""panic attack"". My Psych/Doc said at first to rest a few days and the total withdrawal from daily hassles and stresses, might make this terrifying event subside, or stop altogether. It did not!!!  I was soon diagnosed with Gen. Anxiety Disorder(at age 27, now 38), and have been on ativan and prozac since. I'm no fool, and i know I am 100% dependent on this med. But The worst thing about this med is that it works. And it works so well on my condition that I am prepared to take it until either a magic psychiatrist casts a spell or waves a wand that stops these feelings, or it's time for my ""dirt nap"". I am 6'1"" and 245 and have slowly built a tolerance. I now take prozac 40mg in the AM, and 1mg ativan twice daily, and 1 take a 2mg ativan in the AM.

Use to treat anxiety and heart arrythmia associated with anxiety. Ativan works great to reduce anxiety in about 30 - 60 minutes. I do go months without taking a pill but they're there if I need them. Lately I've been having dizzy spells and reduced vision so I have been taking the ativan to help, but I'm concerned if the symptoms are anxiety related or withdrawl related. I was a fairly heavy drinker for the last year or so. Now I'm in a ""catch 22"" situation. Alcohol withdrawl? Ativan withdrawl? Or anxiety symptoms. Wow, that went off track. All in all I feel the drug is great for anxiety but WILL cause issues when mixed with alcohol. Hey I thought of a side effect that I haven't read yet. Six hours after taking a 1 mg pill, I get cranky and irritable for a few hours. As with all meds, use wisely."

I was on 4+mgs a day for 4 years and I have recently stopped taking it.  When you stop taking this drug ( and one day you will have to) the anxiety is HORRIBLE, your whole body hurts, you cant sleep, eat, function.  It will be WAY worse than any panic attack you have ever had.  I PROMISE you that you need to find other ways to control anxiety.  Benzos will ruin you.  Dr's cant treat a panic disorder when you are blocking the problem with this terrible drug.  If you decide to get off ativan there is a manuel called "" Ashtons manuel.  PLEASE follow this, it will help with WD symptoms.  Getting off this drug is the best thing I ever did, taking it was the worst.  It is NOT helping you.  OH did i mention seizures can be part of WD.  If you dont believe any of this I dare you to stop taking the drug and see how you feel.  I will tell you.....stomach pains ( nauseous) legs will cramp, PANIC ATTACKS, and utter misery.  Get out now while you still can.  Dont be scared.  Try googling a benzo support forum....you wont be alone and trust me it helps.  Detox centers are not prepared for Benzo withdrawl.  Good luck, and if you stay on this drug then your just damning yourself for the inevitable.  Your dose will get to high or your DR will stop writing the Rx.  "

Anyone that is using it now -beware.  I was an ativan user for 4yrs. It was a nightmare. Of course it worked in the beginning, but after awhile it stopped working.  I started with xanax then went to klonipin then ativan. What a mistake. For extreme anxiety it started to work. The md had to continue to increase the dose so I would still get the relief -- or high!  He wanted to increase it to 8mgs but I said no and decided to get off the drug.  It was slowly killing me. Er visits started to increase. I started having a lot of stomach pains, chest pains, and leg pains. Most important was that I felt like a zombie all the time. I wasn't leaving the house and  sunshine bothered my eyes. I just couldn't function outside of the home. I finally had the courage to take control of my own life and decided to admit myself to a hospital detox unit. You cannot do this yourself. I tried. I've been off ativan for 2 1/2 years and I'm doing much better. My NEW md has me on lamical. I'm taking vacations, moved into a new house, gardening, put in a pool. I'm not totally free of the withdrawal yet but I'm still hanging in there and enjoying life. Exercise does help and I've joined two classes. Hint- walking outside helps a lot, drink plenty of water(helps with anxiety) breathing & relaxation music is a must. Remember- ativan is very addicting. My diagnosis was that it was slowing killing me. I DO STRUGGLE EVERYDAY BUT NOW I'M IN CONTROL NOT THE ATIVAN--IT DID IT'S DAMAGE ON ME. Ativan puts a block in your brain so you don't feel the anxiety which makes you feel like you are in a waking coma. If I can help at least one person by my experience then it was worth it. Please don't use ativan -it slowly kills.

I started out with 2mg 3x a day, and am now down to 1mg 2 or 3x a day,  if I'm just chillin at home, just 1mg is effective of keeping ""el diablo"" (panic attacks) away.

It also works well for mild to moderate insomnia. I've found that 1/2 of a 0.5 mg dosage is usually effective for me.  Occassionally I will take  a full 0.5 mg dosage.  I keep the dosage and frequency as low as possible to avoid physical dependence, which is a high risk with this medication (more so than many other drugs in the benzodiazepine family).

538$Condition: Anxious$8/1/2009 1:19:28 AM$Reviewer:  (Patient) $5$3$5$"I used this as an ""abort"" pill at first when I felt a panic attack coming on, at .5 mg as needed. However I became tolerant of that dose and was then prescribed 1 mg twice a day. Incredibly addicting, so much so that I felt the need to take 2 or 3 mg just to fall asleep at night. When I wouldn't take one I would have a panic attack.

ALSO: put me to sleep.

Eventually I made sure that I did not have any more remaining refills and basically holed myself up for a week or so, with no possible triggers for a panic attack, and cut it off cold turkey.

Again, can't stress how addictive this pill is."

I did not find any help from SSRI's that much and still had panic attacks.
Xanax and Ativana re the best for emergency.
But both of them are highly addicted. 
I found Ativan to be less addictive than Xanax.
Now, I take Ativan twice a week, 0.5 mg and I am simply fine. If I do not take it than I get panic attacks.
If I get a real bad panic attack, than I take xanax because it wokrs faster. Those are great but should not be used everyday. If you can control your self, I think that those are the best.

I was scared I would be shaking so bad that I wouldn't be able to put my husband's ring on his finger! I took 1.5 mg of Ativan and everything went perfect. Normally I am unable to speak, choke up, feel like running out of the room, or like I'm going to pee my pants! I was so worried about not being able to say my vows, but this drug worked amazingly well! I have tried Xanax, clonipin, paxil, and welbutrin but they didn't help.

The drug is highly addictive and is, along with all benzodiazapines, very difficult to quit. 

Do yourself a favor if you are considering taking this stuff and do a Google search on Ativan withdrawal. Read the results carefully. 
This stuff only works for a while and then you need to updose to avoid interdose withdrawal.

My chemo was 5 years ago and the painful neurapathy has never went away.  It keeps me awake at night and I can barely stand the pain during the day hours.  I have been taking lorazapam now for 5 years just to sleep and get any relief I can from the constant burning and tingling in my feet and legs.  I am also trying lyrica with the lorazapam and I get some added pain relief but have fears of becoming addicted to these drugs.  Insurance Co's give me a hard time about pre-existing conditions but I figure they can't possibly understand the constant pain I am in.  It's terrible!!!!!! I survived cancer but I am left with pain and uncaring people at the insurance co.  I hope I will be able to keep taking these medications as my husband has lost his job and has been unable to find a new one now for more than a year.  Keep me in your prayers.

As 90% of people in my condition are on disabillity and cannot work, i functioned fine. The most difficult part was getting it from the pharmacy or to get my insurance to pay for it. They always flagged me and tried to make me feel like a druggie or a drug dealer.

I had an anxiety attack so bad a week ago that i went to the e.r and was prescribed a low dose ativan until  could see my regular doctor.  The medicine helped me so much that i cant begin to describe it.  I wasnt able to get in to see my regular pain doctor for the next week or so, and when i did he did not want to prescribe it to me, even after i described how it had opened my eyes and made me realize that i wanted to to stop taking my regular pain meds (methadone, norco)just so that i could have something to make me enjoy life again.  My doctor of course says that he ""hates that medicine"" and it took everything to convince him to at least give me something else for anxity.  So instead he prescribed me very small doses of klonopins.  At first it sounded to me as if they would be similar but to my dissapointment they are not.  Ativans changed the way i was thinking and made me feel very positive about life.  I am now in the process of trying to get my doctor changed so that i may have the option of changing the med.  My advise to anyone out there is to be on top of your case, and dont just let your doctor take advantage of the fact that you dont know as nuch about med. as they do.  Nobody can tell you how much pain you are in. GOOD LUCK"

I had never had an anxiety problem, or sleeplessness issue prior to taking this. It worked for both problems by the second night, and the next 7 months. I was concerned by the second month about becoming dependent on it, but my doctor was not. In hindsight, I would have thrown out what was left, gone to a counselor, and asked for Lunesta. As it was, I could not conduct a normal day without that pill, and spent several unbelievably hellish months attempting to ovecome the physical and emotional dependency. I had no experience with any drugs other than pain medications post surgery, so this warning is given to other drug ""virgins,"" in the hope that they will realize several very important things: counselors are expensive and your health and well-being ARE worth spending this money and time on, and, occasionally, a drug is necessary When it is, get the hell off of it as soon as possible. Do not just assume your doctor will call you up and tell you that he's been thinking, and it's time to take you off! In addition, do an Internet search on what other users of Ativan are saying.

651$Condition: Other$2/28/2009 7:06:42 AM$Reviewer: atreides1024, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I was first diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, and one day the nurse in the hospital administered Ativan to me because of how strung out I was.  Within an hour or so, my stomach was 75% or greater better.  I have recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and my rheumatologist and I both agree that the IBS was probably just the beginning of it, especially after I noticed that the Ativan also worked great on the muscle tightness and soreness, not to mention the fact that going through all ths would make anyone crazy.  Even though they say it's addictive, I haven't had issues with that.  Sometimes I go for a week without the need to take it, so I don't call that addicted.  I personally think they're just being too paranoid about it, but it does depend on the person taking it.  I would highly recommend Ativan to anyone going through either IBS or fibromyalgia symptoms as it has really helped me a lot.

I have tried every other med for anti anxiety effect (anti-depressant or SSRI or SNRI or Prozac) and NOTHING has had ANY effect in relieving the anxiety.  Those meds have actually increased the anxiety and added depression.  I have nothing but good things to say for Ativan/Lorazapam if used as directed for decreasing anxiety.

It was wonderful and I became addicted quickly. I would tAke my pill and knew that in 20 minutes I would just drift off and sleep thru the night.  My docs allowed me to be on it for about 6 mos. (got me thru chemo and radiation) and then they cut me off. Withdrawl was a bit rough-- I tapered down slowly--2-3 days of headache, muscle aches, upset stomach.  It is good for short term use, but be careful. It is really habit-forming.

Every OBGYN wants to put you on an antidepressant which have terrible side effects, so I just stick with this from my primary doctor so I can just take it when I need it.  The doctor prescribed 1. mg but I break them down to .5 and even .25 depending on how I am feeling.  I am prescribed 90 pills at 1.0 mg. and it lasts me a year or so.  I was nervous at first of getting addicted to it, so it makes me more aware of taking it.  I try not to unless I really have to, although, I think sometimes I should just take .25 around ovulation time to help me get through the depression days before my period.  I think it has been a lifesaver for me with my anxiety and it helps me to sleep well.  I usually just take it at night, but I should probably take .25 during the day when I am ovulating.  Working out also helps a great deal with anxiety and depression.  I have started taking a B-complex vitamin, and that seems to be helping as well.

I want to comment on the post concerning alcohol withdrawel and the proper amount to take.  In looking up the drug in a drug book, the possible amounts that can be prescribed are usually somewhere between 4 mil. and 40 mil. per day.  I take only 1 mil. per day for insomnia but a doctor SHOULD know how much to prescribe and if they don't then I suggest another doctor.

I like Ativan because I'm able to get over the anxiety and still finction. True, it does make be a bit sleepy, but one regular cup of coffee takes the sleep away and I'm good to go and ready to function throughout my day. I was on Paxil and all I got from that was a stomach ulcer and other bad side effects. I was taking Ativan PRN and so far my doctor has decided to put me on it regulary. I'm thankful, because it's helped. I've taken prozac with no results as well. Ativan has worked wonders without bad side effects so far.

The effectiveness is more than nothing at all, more than Benadryl, but less effective than the other commonly prescribed sedative or benzodiazepines. I think that rather than calm or sooth the anxiety away, it makes me too stupid to notice some of the things I'd normally notice and possibly feel anxious about. I do like that it lasts longer than others of it's kind, but since it mostly makes me plain old stupid, that can end up a real inconvenience and even an embarrassment. I sometimes get leg cramps or headaches. Also, it seems to give me a cough? I know that may seem way weird, but it does this thing where I get gaggy, and cough a lot. This strange mouth-throat tickle, itch, or just annoyance is hard to describe.
It will have to do until more Doctors feel comfortable prescribing the other benzo type anti anxiety again."

I have since quit taking it, however my doctor is going to start me back on it to help with my IBS.

It is excellent at relieving anxiety and giving a general calming effect. When I felt like I was becoming tolerant to it, that it was losing its effect, I would just cut back on the dose for a while, and then everything would be OK. I did have a very strange reaction one time when I had a glass of wine while on Ativan, all out of proportion to what you would expect, so it's best to be careful about drinking while taking this medicine, I suppose. It is also helpful for insomnia.

Am also about to turn 50! Xanax is way too strong for me and gives me a hangover effect-not good when you are a caregiver! Ativan has been a godsend for me. I have been taking .25mg-.50mg at bedtime for a year. I don't find it to be addictive at all. it sometimes takes a lot to convince a doctor that you are NOT depressed! I had a BAD experience with Prozac years ago. Some doctors immediateley diagnose depression based on what you tell them.It can sometimes be dangerous to allow your family doctor prescribe phychiatric meds! My psychiatrist gives seminars to groups of GP's outlining the hazards of doing just that. I believe Ativan is safe, well tested, and effective based on my experience. I hate it when doctors just write a script for the newest thing on the market, when there are older, tried-and-true drugs that are cheaper.

She saw things and people that were not there and didn't know where she was.  We didn't know they were giving her activan (or what it was).  Both times I demanded to know what was given to her, saying that this was not my mom! As soon as i pulled her from the hospital so she wasn't given it, her mind completely cleared.  Second time, I was across country so wasn't there.  Based on these behaviors, dr diagnosed her with a  type of alzheimers!  I flew in and quizzed the nurse and learned the nurses had been giving her activan to 'calm' her. (really gave it to her so they didn't have to deal with her b/c it made her completely out of it and they could put her in a diaper in a corner and restrain her (she is wheel chair bound).) We took her home and stopped the activan and she quickly returned to normal (no confusion/no delusions)! Please be careful with this drug!! The dr was ready to put my mom in long term care permanently. omg! she is home and doing fine

I have never been on drugs on a regular basis, except for birth control pills. My anxiety attacks were horrible when I went off the drug, nearly unbearable. I woke up in the middle of the night panicked. My husband has reduced his dose for fear that he will become addicted and he has experienced some withdrawl as well.

I started taking it for insomnia and found that it greatly lessened my anxiety attacks. Before taking Lorazapam (Ativan), I would sit at work and spend hours plotting my own death. Now, as long as I take .5mg regularly, I can work without the distraction of suicidal thoughts or anxiety attacks. I take two-three mg at bedtime. I've never slept better and do not have trouble geting up in the morning. I am sure that I am dependent on this drug by now but I would rather take Lorazapam for the rest of my life than deal with the alternatives.

I have tried other treatments, only to fail, since, so I have stuck with this med now 13 yrs, and take 2mg, 5x daily preventively. I have maybe one full blown attack annually now :-)

This medication has helped me live a normal life & allows me to go out in public with out thoughts of having an attack. I have attempted to get off this medication 3 different times but each time my panic attacks would return within 2 days. I started taking 4 pills during the day but I have been able to reduce the amount to 2 pills a day unless I have to go some where in a crowd or previous panic attack situation.  Then, I take a pill before going which prevents an attack. It took 6 long months to diagnois my panic attacks but 2 weeks after starting
ativan I was able to return to stores that I had experienced attacks in before.  I was almost totally house bound because of the dread of having an attack in public.  I realize I will be on this medication for life but the ability to function as normal as possible is definitely worth it.

I was on Ativan 4mg daily for 1 year after a neck injury. It worked SUPER!! Was just put back on after four years, 1mg daily. After being on it for 3 days, I suffered an adverse reaction to the medication and now have for the last week lost my short term memory. After 7 days off the med,I am now able to remember a couple hours out of my day. This is very scary and I suggest before anyone goes on it for long term you read the fine print that Wyeth has. It is common for this reaction in 10% of the prescribed people and in doses of 4mg or more daily. I was not on 4mg, so beware. It also takes 7-20 days for memory to return to normal. I am not saying this drug does not work, because it works well. Just please read the fine print!

I asked him to leave me on it but he said he couldn't it was additive an to wait 2 wks. The reason I wanted to stay on it was I could sleep better at night and anxiety was not there.  I went back told him I was off the lexapro it wasn't working anymore and the ativan did a lot better He asked if I had trouble stopping the lexaprox any side affects I was a little jumpy I was on it for 3 yrs so he went for 2months than 10days off. When I went back this time I told him I had no problem with just quitting Ativan no side effects nothing. He gave me a scrip for 90 days. I wean myself off at times just don't sleep good when I do. This works for me sleep good at night my depression is better and it is CHEAP not like the fancy lexapro.Doc let me have the 90days with refills if I promise him I would stop for a week or so than start again if I had problems stopping call him I am going to continue to take it if I get addicted so be it. I am still better off than I was. I am 71yrs so I have been here a while. Alcohol and gambling are gone that saves me a bundle. I think ativan if there is such a thing is the all in one drug. I quess I will contiue to go off and then back on. Still don't know why you can't just keep on it.

I started taking it when my mother passed away.  It has relieved my panic and anxiety attacks.  I started out with 1mg twice a day and are now on 0.5mg one a day at bedtime.  It has been helpful, I get very severe panic attacks that usually end up in the ER.  But Ativan has helped me a lot.  I am concerned about becoming addicted so my doctor suggested, weening myself off of it, by taking it every other night for a week, then every two nights for a week and so forth.  He has also suggested I see a Phsycologist, which I do on a regular basis, excercise, and relaxing techniques, such as meditation, massage, accupuncture and Yoga.  I am going to try the accupuncture first, then the excercise and then the Yoga.  I will report later.  It was great reading all the reviews, I hope that my review will help someone deal with their anxiety and try the things my doctor has suggested.

It is one of the most painful things my body had ever had to go through, and I have had 5 children. The antivan is much more helpful than not. If I didn't have it I do not know where I would be. My anxiety/panic attacks are too numerous to count. My legs are so achey and can barely walk. There is NO relief for that, is there? My heart races like it is going 400mpminute. I can not sleep more than 2-3 at a stretch. so I am 
overwhelmingly beside myself. If anyone has any answers to this I would so apprecriacite it. My doctor is tapering me off rather quickly, but not cold turkey, thank God. This all started when I went in for a routine outpatient surgery last Jan. 2007.
Three days later I awoke to my entire left side going numb ( a painful numb). Long story short and a gazillion tests later, it was discovered my discs at C7/T1 were completely damaged somehow, during the surgery. Now I have massive panic attacks and anxiety that is unbearable at time.

902$Condition: Anxious$2/28/2008 1:44:46 AM$Reviewer: mel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$" Fantastic drug when used in moderation! Not to be used if genetically inclined to be addicted to anything esp. drugs! Started Ativan when I had a ""screamer"" of a boss. Thought I was just a ""Drama Queen"" while venting my opinions. I thought I was verbalizing for everyone who wouldn't. I swore profusely & rationalized it by calling myself jokingly ""Tammy Tourette"" (as in the syndrome.) However, all my co-workers were indeed stressed but did not ""dramatize"" it as I did.  I went to the Doctor. He diagnosed me with borderline high anxiety and prescribed Ativan. It saved me profusely. Took 1mg at that job(waitress at very busy place.) Was fantastic! Realized I am only one person that can only do what I can do. I want to make everyone happy--Really!
Have now used Ativan off & on for 4 years. No side effects (can take at 2a.m. for insomnia & go to Jazzercise @8:30am) & feel wonderful & go to work standing for 8-hours, lifting, walking, people pleasing, all day. Only side effect for me is that it takes away my stressfully induced ""humor"" which everyone knows me for. But it such a relief to take a break! For them & me!
It's so funny that I'm so paranoid about becoming addicted to a high-anxiety drug that works so well for me. Use it when you need it only. Like taking the sleeper airfare to your destination. Or going to Europe when the jet-lag will kill you the first 3-days. Or going on a job interview. This drug works for that!!"

Only drawbacks is that It erases my memory on the days that I take it....Seriously - cant remeber anything that happened or went on while I was on it, even on very  very low doses.
Second problem is that is wrecks your sex drive, and makes it impossible to climax while you are on it, for up to 2 days after."
917$Condition: Anxious$2/10/2008 8:15:32 PM$Reviewer: bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Ativan is probably the best (perhaps second best behind Xanax) short-acting benzo on the market.  It works wonders for anxiety and other conditions.  Its efficacy is often times demonstrated by the fact that it makes you fall asleep, which is sometimes desired (as opposed to remaining awake and suffering ).  Be careful not to drive after taking this medicine, however, because it has a similar effect on the brain as alcohol (I am not sure of the Chemistry behind that statement, but that is what I have been told by psychiatrists and pharmacists.)  Great short-acting benzo, but highly addictive, so be very careful.  Do not abuse it, and be cautious when coming off of it - make sure you do not precipitously stop taking it b/c there could be serious withdrawal symptoms.  Just be careful with it and it will work wonders (in the short term).  Try Klonopin for a longer acting benzo...

Worked well for preventing nausea and vomiting during treatments but now it has been 7 months I've been on it and am trying to stop taking it. It isn't helping my anxiety anymore so I'm taking 1/2 of a 1mg. tablet once or twice a day. I am having a very hard time with my nerves. Also, I take ambien cr at night along with the Ativan and it had helped with Restless Leg Syndrome. I don't know if this medicine can cause a feeling of pressure at the base of your throat or not but I've already had my esophagus stretched once and it didn't help. If anyone else has had that choking or lump in the throat feeling please post that.

Along with my other medications, Ativan taken on an as needed basis and always at night for sleep it really helps me to calm down and releave tension. As anyone with GAD you feel as if you are ""A CAT ON A HOT TIM ROOF"" (edgy). Resulting in many headaches and mood swings that can sometimes make the attacks worse. So taking Ativan is great and the side effects are mild. It can be an addicting drug but so can chocolate!"

But like they say this is for sure a SHORT TERM drug.  My tolerence kept building and I was taking more and more every couple of days or else it just wouldn't work.  I took Ativan for four months and one day decided to stop because Ativan had been causing headaches.  Don't get me wrong, the headaches were worth the relief from panic attacks, but I figured I was going to try to beat my anxiety without drugs.  I stopped taking Ativan and had no side effects and no withdrawl symptoms.  Also, my panic attacks went away.   All in all, this is a good drug, just don't become dependent on it!!!

Unfortunately, I would find later that I would have yet another episode (often worse) exactly 24 hours later. To me, this was a sign of withdrawal, as the subsequent attacks were otherwise unprovoked. I've heard of how addictive this drug is, and using it caused me to spiral into a pattern that I would not have gone into had I simply taken a hot bath. So nowadays, if I do have a moment, I take a low dose of Diazepam (Valium) instead.

Withdrawl symptoms can be evident and unpleasent if I've used my prescription too quickly in a given month.  I take 60 .5mg tablets every thirty days.
     This medicine has wonderful potential to help anxious people  feel comfortable; however, it must be used with descretion.  I have discussed increasing my dose or number of tablets with my doctor, but am concerned with withdrawl symptoms.  Three tablets a day may be better than two, but eventially I'm afraid I would require four and on.  Each patient and physician should determine the dose and frequency based on the individual's condtion, body and response to therapy."

Lorazepam is a godsend in that on days I'm feeling anxious, I take it, and I feel like myself again.  Other days, if I feel good, I don't take it.  The only downside is that about 5 hours after I take it I get pretty drowsy, but it's worth the relief and the ability to be free from anxiety.  My only concern is that I've heard it can be addictive, so I'm always overly fearful of taking it more than a couple of days in a row.

Since ativan is the primary drug used to treat major seizures, I asked my neurologist if I could take it to prevent aura's and ""breakthough seizures"" from progessing to grand mals. It works.. but only the brand name ativan is prescribed since it dissolves most quickly sublingually.  Generic lorazapam takes too long, and recirculates too much leaving a bad ""hangover"" effect then next day. PLEASE educate docs about this use!  Too many epilepsy patients are left seizuring ending up in ER's or with ""nuked neurons"" when parents and patients can intervene on the spot"

Most recently, I have been able to face bloodwork without being medicated and I feel that it is because I have been able to become ""desensitised"".  I still take the med for IV's.  Having tried several kinds of therapy in my life and even begged to be held down for my marriage blood work to be drawn, I agreed to try anxiety medications.  This is, by far, the best for me.  I take it an hour before the sched ""needle time"" and usually hit the height of the medication's effects at approx. an hour and a half after taking the pills.  
I credit Lorazepam with helping me experience enough blood draws comfortably that I no longer need it for that and hope to reach that point with IV's, too. "

The humor wore off quickly as this rage became down right dangerous and completely uncontrollable. I at the urging of the bone marrow transplant team's Psychiatrist, I started taking 5 mg of lorazepam the morning of my chemo, and in the evening after it, and then twice a day for 48 hrs  I cannot express the relief that I and my family feel now.

The doctors tell you that, they do not, however, tell you what can happen if you take for a long period of time. I have been taking Lorazepam for 6 years, 1 mg/twice a day. Prior to that I was on Xanax for 10 years.I have now become tolerant and am having withdrawal symptoms. I have done quite a bit of research on this and withdrawal can last years or even decades. This drug needs to be tapered off VERY slowly for a minimum of about 10 months. Some people have terrible withdrawal symptoms for years after stopping this medication. It messes with the Gaba receptors in your brain as well as your central nervous system. Read the Ashton Manual. Doctors keep prescribing these types of drugs because they are getting kickbacks from 'Big Pharma' to do so. Do your research and get off this horrible drug if you have been on for a long time.

My psychiatrist has had me taking these pills as needed for over a year now.  They come in handy whenever I’m feeling stressed, am about to go in a stressful situation, or feel anxious while trying to switch over depression medications.  It can make me feel calm, though not necessarily happy.  I find that it has less effect if I start taking it too often for too long, but overall it has been a helpful medicine.  I recommend taking it as needed whenever you feel yourself start getting anxious.  Don’t wait until you’re entirely bogged down in anxiety!

My doctor started me on this in addition to an anti-depressant, because my anxiety stops me from taking that last step to swim, go out to lunch, have a relaxed, honest conversation with people who are close to me, picking up the phone...you get what I mean, I hope. It is a very low dose- 1mg. up to four times a day. It does seem to quiet the anxiety and if I push myself I can do the things (above) that I would really like to do. However, even this low dose adds to my constant fatigue, which might just be a psychosomatic (?) symptom in the first place, I don't know. What I am trying to say is that this helps me sometimes to get out of myself and do things that make me nervous because I know if I would just do them, I will probably have a lot of fun from the experience.

I have had stressful sleep for years and have a really hard time staying asleep due to anxiety.  I'd rather have 5 hours a night of good sleep vs. 8 hours of stressful sleep.  It's like not sleeping at all.  The doctor said I need to take 1mg at night before bedtime to sleep well.  She said that taking it just once a day will not cause physical addiction because the half life is 12 hours.  So she said it's important to break that 12 hour cycle up to prevent physical addiction.  She said if I take it for a long time, less than 12 hours apart, apparently that's when you can get physically addicted.  The doctor said I may end up psyhologically addicted, but that's easy to kick shortly after I stop taking it.  1mg an hour before I want to go to sleep works absolutely great.  I haven't slept so good since I was a kid.  The doctor said that the only real side effects from this drug are addiction, and it's very important to get good sleep or I'll end up with other problems, like high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney problems, increased stress, etc.  So I feel any possible side effects of long term use of this drug is probably worth it.  I feel great, am probably healthier overall from it, and can get more out of life now that I don't have to walk around like a sleepless zombie all day.

I can't concentrate, I'm very forgetfull, I don't know what I'm doing. Has anyone else felt this way?

Stress makes my spasms worse.  Too much stress also my make anxiety/mania levels begin to crawl upwards.  My Doctor gives a certain amount of 1mg. lorazepam pills per day.  I am instructed to take these pills PRN(as I need it.)  I take ativan when stress builds and my anxiety/mania starts to effect me or when my palsy spasms get painful.  The lorazepam calms all these things.  Me getting to take the ativan whenever I get symptoms instead at a set time (say at night)works out really well and I get the full benefit of the drug when I really need it.

It does relieve anxiety and helps me sleep at which I have trouble with both.  However, if you don't spaace out your dosages (example, 1mg every two to three days)and take it every night for more than four weeks, when you try not taking it for a night, you will have troulbe falling asleep, at least I do.  It is now 3:10am and have to be to work by 8:00am and am up looking at these reviews to see if my symtoms are common.  From what I have read so far, it seems that most people when they try to stop taking Lorazepam, have a hard time going to sleep.  Scary, for me, when I can't sleep, the anxiety attacks occur.  I have tried many sleep aids but none tried so far work as well as this med but, it comes with a price.

My primary DR prescribed .5 mg per day as needed.  I admit I take Ativan (Lorezepam) to sleep or to relax when I take long road trips and not necessarily for Anxiety.  But...here is the bad part...a few months ago, I noticed hair in the drain.  Hair in the sink.  The pillow.  Everywhere.  I did not have thick hair anyway, but now, my ponytail is so thin and limp, the hair loss is really bad.   At first I was told Ativan was not the cause.  Now, I see, it certainly can be.  So, I am taking a tiny .025 dose a day to get off of it.  I guess I will have to find another way to sleep and relax because losing hair makes me far less calm than anything else!  BEWARE if you want your HAIR!

Worked great-no side effects. With sleep I am perfect during the day. But my Dr. will only prescribe it along with an antidepressant, so now on zoloft too-side effects-weight gain/sexual-Ugh...not happy about that. Benzos like ativan are addicting though and she wants me to eventually ween off the ativan and stay on the zoloft only. I tried this last year and couldnt just get off the ativan, so I weened off both slowly after a year with no problems...had 8 months med free...5 good months then 3 struggling...and now the need to start all over. Now have to try to come off it again and stay on the zoloft. I take one .5 at 5pm and two .5 at 9pm. Slept thru the night for the first time in a very long time. Tonight I will stop the 5 pm one as I want to keep the dose as low as possible. On zololt 25mg now...going up to 50 next week per Drs orders, but I'd like to stay at 25 and just might.

It has worked well and kept me functioning all these years. I was put on this at Ochners Clinic in New Orleans. My present Dr. says I am doing better than any of his other fibro patients and does not want me to change to anything else. I also take 50mg of Loudiomil at bedtime to help me sleep. These have been a lifesaver for me. I know i am addicted to this medicine but the fibro pain is unbearable without it. I take very little pain medication. I am 65 years old now and play 18 holes of golf several times a week. I saw recently they were experimenting with ativan for fibro treatment. I can tell you factually that it works and I owe my life to the Drs. at Ochners who were years ahead of other Centers in the treatment of Fibromialgia.

Of all the drugs I've tried, it has been the most helpful with the least side effects. I try not to take it every night and go off it for months at a time. It was most effective when I first started taking it; I quickly developed a tolerance and needed a higher dose which I didn't want to take so I just continued to take .5 or less. I generally take .25. It does help me fall asleep and wake up less often and sleep more soundly.  It only makes me a little groggy and the withdrawal symptoms when I stop taking it have been minimal--headache and slightly shaky feeling. I don't like being dependent on any drug but it's better than not sleeping! There are times when it's been a great relaxant and stress reliever.

1425$Condition: Chronic Trouble Sleeping$11/17/2009 5:09:22 PM$Reviewer: Caution, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$I took this drug (1 mg) once a day in the evenings following a long period of hospitalization after a leg amputation.  It helped me sleep and reduced mild anxiety.  My prescription was for 45 tablets, and I didn't attempt to renew the prescription.  So I stopped cold, and now after reading the data sheet on the drug, realized that was a mistake.  I went through about a 3-day withdrawal, during which I felt somewhat like a clockspring that had been wound too tight.  Great difficulty sleeping and a constant feeling that something ominous was about to happen.  Be careful taking this drug.  I've recently learned it was one of the drugs contributing to Michael Jackson's death.

Thankfully, I have proceeded through detox and all withdrawal symptoms. Lorazepam has been very beneficial in my treatment by curbing my desires to drink and has given me most gratifying sleep that i have so sought for many years. Lorazepam has put balance in my life, and has removed the fear of my unknown future, replaced by reassured hope.

I was prescribed 1 mg. every 8 hours or as needed 5 days ago. They also gave me a dose of it in the hospital via IV. I have taken it the past 4 days in a row with no side effects except I feel calmer, happier and a little sleepy but still totally functional. I started taking it in the evening so if I had any side effects maybe I could sleep through them. I am taking it earlier each day so I can benifit from the calming effects more. I am still only taking 1 pill a day. I am worried about possible side effects that could happen and addiction. But I don't want to stop taking it because it is really helping. (BTW I was in the hospital for a kidney infection not anxiety, the dr. felt I was having anxiety) Most of the reviews so far have been very positive, can anyone give me some advice on what side effects are most common, how soon side effects happen,(I've been taking it 5 days now) and how addicting it actually is? I don't really take much medicines, just tylenol and I take some herbal remidies like ST. Johns wort and Evening Primrose Oil.

1443$Condition: Anxious$9/18/2009 2:13:41 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I first was diagnosed with Autism, Bipolar, Depression and then anxiety. This medication has helped me sleep at night along with two hydrocodone for chest wall pain. I only take the two at night thoguh because both make you feel sleepy. The Bipolar has been ruled out and so has the depression. There is still Autism at times but this medication is wonderful for anxiety and panic attacks that come at any level (whether strong or moderate). I am both a Certified Nursing Assistant and Emergency Medical Technician and find the Ativan especially helpful on very stressfull days and alot of those days just happen to fall on the day i am having chest wall pain. So If you have chest pain with your anxious feelings try adding a little bit of hydrocodone with your dr's persmission. When you get anxious your muscles tighten up as well, even your throat and airway. Hope this helps for some of you because it sure helped me.

I used to wake up in the middle of the night and once my brain started thinking I could not go back to sleep. I find this drug works with you. If you are going to sleep it slows your mind down so you can sleep. If you take it during the day for anxiety it slows your anxious thinking down but does not make you (me) lethargic. I take 2mg a night and very rarely during the day. I guess it's a good thing that I am scared to not take as directed. One side note. I went away for the night and did not have any and my sleep was very restleness and I woke up a lot. I hope this only means that the drug is working as it is supposed to and if you don't have it you are back to where you started. Addiction is scary to me. Can you be addicted even if you take as directed and never up the dose?

Yes, the pill is addictive because when I weaned myself off of them, I started having anxiety attacks, and my asthma symptoms came back.  I tried to not touch the bottle of pills, but finally resorted to it because I would have fainted or lost it if I didn't have them.

I only take as needed and now I pretty much carry the bottle in my purse as a saftey blanket, but rarely have to actually take a pill. However, if you are taking this for anxiety it should not be the only thing you are taking for your condition. You need to be on a everyday medication as well, this will decrease your need to take the pill and decrease your chances of dependancey. My Dr. will not perscribe this medication alone, I have to take my Effexor to get this script. But when you have a bad bout with anxiety, this is a great pill to have handy!! Usually brings me down in about 5 minutes. Also useful for help sleeping,I normally take Ambien everynight but if it gets to late or I don't feel like taking the Ambien, 1 or 2 of these and I am fast asleep....usually for the entire night!

I have an optic nerve condition that causes my vision to go crazy.  Everything will go purple, or everything I see is wavy.  I even have bouts of complete blindness.  It's been hard to not panic and this drug has helped with calming me down and slowing my heart rate.  I would panic and pass out and that rarely happens anymore.  It is very addictive and I sometimes find myself running out before I'm able to get it refilled.  If used properly, very effective.  Be careful to not get the mentality that if one works so well, two would be even better.  But the good definitely outweighs the bad.

I started getting anxiety bec I could not sleep and decided to take a Sonata sleeping pill (trying not to take sleeping pills..)

Now I am thinking after 4 months, my body is intolerant to my cutting down on the dose. I think its time to get off. I hear its very hard to quit. Try not to up the dose, once your body tells you it needs to up the dose, its time to get off, unless you do not care about its addicting qualities.

For those who understand how debilitating anxiety and insomnia are, you will find the calming effects of this drug a welcome relief. Works miracles on relieving anxiety and helping to fall asleep.

It seems particularly valuable in situations where my anxiousness is so great that I am unable to concentrate at work. It calms me considerably thus allowing me to be more productive.

However there is a trade off. My mental acuity is not as sharp and it gives me the feeling of being slightly intoxicated. Not surprisingly it lowers my energy level and makes me feel slightly sleepy. Yet still a good trade off versus a panic freeze that makes me completely dysfunctional. Also I've discover that it is best to use the smallest dose possible that will still allow me to derive the benefit without experiencing the hazy side effects. I often break the one milligram pill in half or even quarters. 

I try never to use it more than 2 days in a row for fear of addiction.

I also use it at night for insomnia that results from racing mind syndrome. Used in conjunction with ambien, I never fails to get me to sleep and usually sleep 8 hours or more. (Wouldn't suggest this for those who have any side effects with ambien). I do have a slight hang over effect from the lorazepam which makes it hard to hit the ground running in the morning, but not as bad as the hangover you get from a night of drinking. 

Overall, I've had a good experience... and it certainly has saved many a day I would have otherwise just been pacing the floor... wringing my hands over an anxiety attack. "

1617$Condition: Anxious$2/13/2008 11:29:30 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was prescribed this drug by my physician after reporting I had shortage of breath and chest pains, numbness in my arms and dizziness. After talking about the situations when these symptoms took place and some additional testing he determined I was having panic attacks. I was told to take 1/2 of pill when I felt an attack coming on. It worked and has consistently for more than 2-years. I don't take it daily, only when I feel an attack or when I know I'm going to be in a situation that might bring one on. Also, I was diagnosed with IBS, usually also brought on by stressful situations (public speaking, meetings, etc) and this is resolved by taking the medication as well. I have, however, increased the dosage to one entire pill. If I don't use it for more than a couple weeks and then take it, side effects such as slight lightheaded-ness or dizziness, but not enough to make me not want to take it by any means. My physician put me on a very low dosage of Prozac to take on a daily basis to replace the Lorazepam because he was afraid I might develop a dependency, but I still occasionally would need the Lorazepam for panic attacks. I have quit taking the Prozac and only rely on the Lorazepam for attacks or prevention because I was never taking it regularly enough to develop dependency. I appreciate the calmness, decrease of worry and sense of ease resulting from the drug and the lack of any negative side effects.

I was so badly in pain, that I was hyperventilating and my hands were numbing up and tingling. The ER dr had the nurse give 2 doses of Ativan in my IV, and after about 5 mins or so, I begain to calm down. (IT DOES NOT TAKE PAIN AWAY, BUT JUST CALMS YOU SO THEY CAN SEE HOW MUCH PAIN RELIEF MEDS TO GIVE YOU).  My breathing slowed, and my hands resumed normal feelings. I was then given a dose of Dilaudid for pain.  The fact that they had to do 2 doses is because I was severly freaking out over the pain.  Maybe others require less Ativan, nonetheless, effective enough.   Made me want to go to sleep and had blurred vision as well.

My husband began telling me about his hallucinations, and I realized that whenever he would be injected with the drug in his IV he would begin to hallucinate, become confused and agitated, and forget where he was and why he was in the hospital. After 3 more days he refused the drug. The hallucinations, confusion and agitation went away. This is a serious drug and the side effects should be carefully monitored. Caregivers be aware of the side effects and monitor your loved ones carefully while on this drug. A patient exhibiting hallucinations, severe agitation, confusion and forgetfulness should IMMEDIATELY stop this medicine!

He suffers from vascular (tia's) disease and it took him 4 days before he was responsive again.

She has been in a very deep sleep for about 4 hours, and counting.  I believe that it was moreso the doctors fault than the medicine itself, but I really thing this drug should be avoided.  I don't know whats how she is going to be when, if she wakes up.  But the side effects of speech impairment, confusion, anxiety, death, ect. are truely heartbreaking thoughts. This drug should actually be banned.

Then, they used it a SECOND time with the same results.  Either this was never mentioned or WHATEVER, they used it a third time and this third time may very well have caused his deathe.  He could not breathe perhaps because he became so agitated and he had to be resassatated.
