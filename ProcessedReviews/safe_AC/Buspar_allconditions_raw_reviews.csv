I had tried several medications prior to this one, but none of them had been effective for me. I had to take this one 3 times a day, but it helped me manage my anxiety and didn't have any unpleasant side effects. I felt better than I had in a long time and was eventually able to stop taking it all together. Over-all, I give this treatment a high rating.
