0$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$9/1/2019 6:23:08 AM$Reviewer: Mike , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$2$"I’m 39 years old and have been taking this medicine (3mg) for almost a week. I have ADD which was pretty noticeable by me and my family. I went to the doctor and tried 2 different medicines but the side effects was high blood pressure and constipation so they didn’t workout. The first few day on this medicine I was so tired. When I got up in the morning I could barely stand up and walk without stumbling but it has gotten better. I noticed now when I get up I’m dizzy and it feels like it feels when you stand up to fast and the blood rush to your head. Also I noticed that my legs get numb and my arm get numb and fingers tingling. I’m assuming its affecting my blood circulation. 
My final take on what I like about this medicine:
It works for me as far as treating my symptoms and I can notice a huge difference in being able to focus and. Also my blood pressure was slightly elevated before this medicine but is now in normal range.

What I don’t like:
The side effects is bothering me with the dizziness, tingling, and numbness in my limbs. If this doesn’t get better soon I might have to stop taking."

It did not help with her ADHD at all and she started falling asleep in the afternoons at school. She wouldn't want to do her classwork and lost any interest in school.

I was sleepy all the time and mentally exhausted.  I didn't want to go back on a stimulant because they make me very moody and irritable.  I have been on this for about 2 months. Started with 1 mg, good for the week and surprised I wasn't more sleepy after reading all the reviews. Noticed a slight difference in tiredness and mental focus. Increased to 2 mg and doing great. Not tired, not exhausted, sleeping well. I do get tired and mental drained in the afternoons and I'm discussing 3 mg worth my dr. Waiting 1 more week before we do that. Overall I'm completely happy with this and so glad I didn't go back to a stimulant.  I am also on stetrilene.

He started taking about 5mg of Vyvanse but the side effects have been terrible.  He would hardly eat anything, sleep deprived, angry, argumentative, and just plain hard to deal with after the medicine wore off for about a solid 2-3 hours.  We are now in the fourth grade and tried to up his dosage to 20 mg but could not get past 15mg.  The side effects became worse.  He even started a sniffing tic that was so annoying.  He was getting into trouble for silly little things like playing in the bathroom at school, talking out of turn etc.  Thankfully he did not get into fights or such.  He is a sweet, loving child.  He does pout if he does not get his way though.  With all that said, we went back to the doctor and he put him on 5mg of adderall.  Same side effects.  We took him off and the with drawl was horrendous!!!! So we started with Guanfacine- Tenex on November 2nd and he is so much better as far as calm, kind, not argumentative, not mean, not smart acting.  He will not reach full effects until at least 8-9 weeks.  Being tired should subside!  My only hope now is that he has more drive and willingness to do homework and things that are required of him after he gets through the tired stage.  So much better than the stimulants.
9$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/8/2016 1:09:33 AM$Reviewer: anonimous, 13-18 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $2$3$2$As the primary caregiver of my grandson who was diagnosed with having ADHD five years ago at the age of eight. Taking the long acting guafacine HCL WAS helpful with him getting a reasonable amount of sleep with out getting up perioticly through out the night. It was unfortunately causing him to be tired and sleepy through out the day and hard to maintain in class at school not feeling like doing much of anything. It didn't seem to help his ADHD, Other than slowing him down. He became over time aggressive with his behavior as if he was regressing reverting back to the behaviors he was depicting in the beginning before he was diagnosed and put on medication. When he decided to not take it anymore, after about two weeks of not taking the guanfacine he complained of feeling sick with nausea. The nausea appeared to have only lasted for one day. His Dr. was informed of his discontinuance. Since then he appear to not be as tired and is some what more willing to doing his homework and is not showing the aggression but showing more calmness.

My doctor advised me to take this medication at bedtime, because it is a extended release medication. I have noticed I wake up in the middle of the night sweating. Also, I get tired by the middle of the day for a couple of hours then have a burst of energy. The medicine does make me more calm, manages my anxiety and reduces my restlessness, however, the drowsiness is very annoying.

I have been taking it for 3 weeks, the first 3 days in the morning...then I stopped because I was SO tired. Then I started taking again at night 3 weeks ago, and I get tired a few times throughout day at work and then really tired at night. I just want to come home and sleep....only to wake up between 12:30-2am. For my myself, the benefits of this drug helping me focus don't outweigh the side effects. I feel like it's more of an anti hyper drug by making you VERY tired. I plan on not taking it anymore....I've created habits at work to help me focus like daily checklists and writing everything down.

Worked with an outpatient crisis center for children as she was becoming violent.  After 5 weeks they prescribed this medication and this time I opted to use.  She also was told 1/2 pill in morning and 1/2 at night.  Very lethargic and complained constantly of that.  After 2 weeks started to see dramatic reduction in behaviors.  After 4 months of being on it, the Grand Mall tantrums are GONE!!  She still is hot headed but has a window to think and her reaction is so much better.  Grades improved and I highly recommend.  

Con - there is NOT enough studies on the affects this has on children.  They really don't even know how it works, let alone the long term affects.  I will keep her on it for 1 year and take her off slowly and see if it was a behavior.   "

My 17 yo patient w/ ADHD also had depressive and anger problems.  We had struggled with multiple different medications for ADD and as well as antidepressants and some antipsycyhotics. I decided to try him on Intuniv.  1mg made him so sleepy that I told the family to stop it.  The mother, however, chose to cut the dose in half (1/2 mg).  The results have been astounding.  Not only has the ADHD been dramatically improved, but the depression and anger have disappeared.  He even gets along with his 16yo sister.

It is in combination with Concerta.  This was used to replace Strattera, as the side affects from that went from none to us ready to commit him!  He takes 1mg in morning with Concerta and 1/2 about 3pm.  As tachycardia was becoming an issue, it no longer is plus it works so much better!  He does have other issues (connectivity with front and back of brain, takes resperidol for that), trying to find something to work was not easy.  He is in 6th grade, maintains a 2.9 or higher gpa, and has finally made a few friends!  He still has some difficulty with peers and attention, but nothing like it was!  This is one of the best meds they have tried with him.  He continues this dose with his others.  Still a handful first thing in morning before meds and close to bedtime, but at least it isn't all day!  Very happy with this one!

At first he was sleepy a lot. Then as time passed by we could tell the difference when he missed a dose. It helps, but I am still concerned about my child interaction with other children. He is a lovable sweet person, but sometimes other children sees him as being over bearing and irritating. My child does not like being alone. He is a sociable person. I don't know if I need to look for other medicines that can assist with this behavior. Adults love him, because he is so loving in caring, but other children as well as his siblings don't share the sentiment. Has anyone experienced this with their kids? What options were you given or did you take to help your child? Thanks in advance!

She has been taking it for 3 months.  She started off with 1 pill a day and after a month put on 2 pills a day.  Just this month put on 3 pills a day.  (which is what the doctor initially discussed)  I feel that this medication is working but I am closely watching the side effects.  She has gained 10 lbs in 2 months but that could also be the age she is.  She is also more moody and seems to be more sensitive too.  Again this could be her age as the hormones are playing a part in this.  Another side effect I have noticed is that she is restless more at night and tends to sleep walk once or twice during the night.  Overall I am happy with this drug and it seems to be working to help her stop the urge to pull.  I must also say that we have tried all kinds of techniques with nothing working but this medication.

We switched after being unhappy with the side effects of focalin & methyl phenidate, which both helped her focus in school but took away her wonderful personality.  She is now able to focus, is less hyper, and has finally got her appetite back after 2 years of being on the other stimulants.  We are happy to see that she is gaining weight.  She is also a happier child on this medication.  The only issues we've had was that if we gave too much, her system had trouble metabolizing and it would ""build up"" and she'd have insomnia at night.  We currently give her 1/2 a pill (0.5 mg) which seems to be right for her.  I would definitely recommend this medication for others who have concerns about their child's personality being ""flat"" on the stimulant meds.  It certainly is worth a try.  Be aware that in the start-up phase, your child will be sleepy, but this goes away after they get used to it (within a few days of each dose increase).  Good luck!"

My son, who is ten now, has been on guanfacine for quite some time (2 yrs) after running the gamit of medicines...  Stimulants would work adequately, but suppress his personality, and he had zero friends... none whatsoever... it was heartbreaking to watch...  A low dose strattera and the guanfacine has worked miracles... The long half life of the tenex makes this ideal, and no medicine during school!   The tiredness will decrease with continued use, and the full effects are realized several weeks after use.

He is almost 6 now. The doctors couldn't give him a stimulant because he also has a mild form of Tourette's and a stimulant would bring out his ticks. So now after a year of use, I have noticed a HUGE change in my son. He is more calm and reasonable regarding situations which he use to not have any patience for. And it's not to a point where he is like a zombie which was my biggest fear when staring him on medication. If I give him his medicine 2 or 3 hours late, I notice a huge difference. His hyperactivity and ticks flare up and he has trouble focusing. As a parent formerly against medicating children for ADD & ADHD, I am glad I did this because my son is so smart and has been doing excellent at school now that he can focus better.

72$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/26/2017 12:14:35 AM$Reviewer:  Female  (Caregiver) $1$1$1$I just wanted to say this as a warning to parents out there. This drug has not been tested and approved by the FDA for treatment of ADHD. It actually has only been approved to treat high blood pressure. Similarly, it has not been found to be helpful in treating ADHD in children under 12 or even safe. The use of this drug is not recommended for children under age 12. I understand that it is often prescribed, but you should be aware that many doctors do not know that this drug has not been tested on children and is not approved to be given to them. Studies have been done on children over age 13 and have shown a marginal impact on ADHD behaviors. High Blood Pressure medicines have been found to impact mood and even cause depression. If your child has calmed down it is likely due to a lowering of their blood pressure, not addressing of their ADHD.

Can sit with a task for more than two minutes. He's still has his sense of humor and still protests like a normal 4 year old. The deliberate defiance and rage is gone. Also, he can walk! Who knew? He had two speeds. Standing still and running. Best decision I made for us. After three years of this nightmare. I finally feel like we've got our life back.

Has to be contained by physically holding him while he screams non-stop, hits you in face, kicks, very agressive.  Hold by force till he can calm down.  We continue to tell phychiatrist he's no better is getting worse.  He now is afraid someone will break in house.  He has no appetite, can't sleep, afraid he is going to hurt someone. I am  under treatment.  Stitches in one leg & surgery on other.  One area he is hitting or kicking the other leg which has open wound he sneaks up on my and throws heavy objects at wound. He is showing serious signs of confusion but now talks a lot of violence.  Only one doctor is area will treat a child this young.  Am desparate to find a second opinion someplace even another state.  He only will drink milk or juice.  We have very hard time getting him to eat.  Struggling to keep him from losing weight.  I would NEVER put a child on this drug ever again. He's in pre-kindergarten and am holding breathe he is not going to be thrown out.  He is very intelligent, articulate but the articulate is regressing and he's now speaking in ""foreign"" tongue.  You look into his little eyes and he appears so lost.  Be careful on use, at first we thought he was going to do well.  We had a week where he was out of meds and we couldn't get through to the pychiatrist.  His personally changed and he was pleasant...back on meds he's totally out of control. He loves to build (blocks) is very smart but if they fall or break apart he becomes wild.  He attacks you, knocks over furniture, throws everything insight.  Suggestions anybody?

I was taking 3 benzos ( valium, Klonopin and lorazepam) plus ambien for sleep. I still did not sleep at all plus i was addicted to the medications. When i decided to go off of all narcotics my doctor was reluctant to dc the meds due to my severe PTSD, i sought help froma different doctor. This new doctor prescribed me tenex and told me he used it off label as a blocker of adrenaline to help with the PTSD, i wasnt quite sure how a blood pressure med would help with PTSD but it makes perfect sense, with PTSD we have a fight or flight reaction to situations, horrible nightmare and lack of sleep, the fight or flight syndrome causes an adrenaline rush so the medication blocks that arenaline. I have never slept better than I do now, this drug is a wonder. I have not had 1 side effect, I no longer have to rely on narcotics, i was deemed disabled due to the PTSD and now I am working, enjoying life and functioning. I also have to see a psychologist in conjuction with the medication but it is so wonderful to sleep again.

He also claimed that his ""hands were out of control"". The doctor and I were in complete agreement, and we pulled him off of it. It was only a 1 mg dose once a day around lunchtime, but once we pulled him off of it the aggression abruptly disappeared as quickly as it had come. We won't be using it again anytime soon... And I hope the FDA periodically reads these reviews, so hopefully they know that this is a possibility with this medicine, at least in young children.."

He was on it for three days and I was already seeing positive effects.  I was happy.  However, on the 4th day, he told me he had a pain in his chest and that he'd had it since the day before.  We needed to discontinue this medication and try somethign else.  I was sorry about that, since I thought it was working so well and I liked that it was not a stimulant.

111$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$8/12/2010 11:27:12 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$My 18 yr old daughter, our youngest, has been taking this drug along with Concerta for over 10 years. It has helped her tremendously! It made a difference immediately. She was able to focus better and helped her stop throwing temper tantrums every time she didn't get her own way. She started out taking 1/4 of 1mg tablet and is now taking 1 1mg tablet at bedtime. I am a mother of 3 children; 2 w/ADHD and 1 w/ADD and all took ritalin to begin with and are now on Concerta. Their doctor monitored their weight, height and blood pressure to make sure they were where they should be for their age. We make sure our children eat before taking the medication so there is a minimal loss of appetite. We have also taught them that medication isn't the answer for everything and not to go through life thinking a pill is going to solve their problems! Parents, be cautious and research everything. Talk to your doctor before you give your children anything! When my children started a new medication or dosage change-I did it on the weekend so I could monitor if there were any side effects! And never ever, give your child more than what the physician has prescribed! If your child seems spaced out-call your doctor immediately! The dosage may need to be adjusted or changed or stopped altogether! People think kids who take medication act like they are drugged or spaced out. People don't know my children take medication unless I tell them and most of the time, they don't believe me! Medication doesn't work for everyone, but it has worked for mine.
