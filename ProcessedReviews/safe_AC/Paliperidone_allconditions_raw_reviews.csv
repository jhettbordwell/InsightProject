I have actually had a suppressed appetite and lost 10.4 lbs. Medication does not work typically on me like others. I have so much less anxiety and my mood and voices are now under control. My suicidal ideation is pretty much gone. I started at 3 mg, but it wasn't effective until I got up to 9 mg. I have Schizoaffective disorder. This is the only medication that I feel is helping me cope. It was also a last resort because I've been on all of the old ""typical"" antipsychotics and the new ""atypicals."""

12$Condition: Other$8/16/2008 1:50:46 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$This medicine has worked very well for my mood regulation (bipolar type II and / or borderline personality dirorder & Schizoaffective (Schizioid / thinking along /w mood problems).  Mental illness, in some instances, is extremely hard to diagnose, and you may never know exactly what the diagnosis is.  It is best to try medicines in combinations untill you find what works.  I am using 6 mg of Invega, 1500 mg of Depakote ER, & 60 mg of Cymbalta.  I feel better than ever before.  Good luck..  Also, this is the best atypical antipsychotic, in my opinion, because of its efficacy (how well it works) & side effect profile (none that I've noticed besides low blood pressure which is actually a good thing in most instances)  They use special technology to allow the drug to be metabolized over a 24 hour period which is best for symptom control.  This is the most technologically advanced medicine right now.

He is almost unable to eat unassisted at times.  This was piled onto my bipolar spouse's regimen while also on lithium,  Depakote and diabetes meds.

Started getting the shot in March I think and in a month or 2 the sycosis subsided. Been on it now for almost a year and haven't heard any voices that aren't really there or seen anything that isn't really there. This was probally my 5th time having sycosis. This time I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I haven't really noticed any side effects. Except for I had lost some wieght then gained 20 lbs back and I am making alot of the hormone that you have when you are pregnant but am not pregnant. That causes me to produce milk. When I first started getting the shot I was scared. Getting the shot in the arm hurts for a few days afterward. The hip doesn't really hurt at all.

33$Condition: Schizophrenia$4/1/2014 10:20:28 AM$Reviewer: Micky Lagoski, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I was diagnosed with ""schizophrenia"" at the age of 35, so quite late. Invega (6mg) makes the voices in my head completely disappear or preventing them. Besides, bizarre delusions, like equipment that can read your mind, are eliminated. Taking Invega gives you a calm mind, thoughts don't ramble. Furthermore angry feelings  are decreased. Because of the gradually and continuous release of the medicine (new release system), one doesn't feel a drug boost - drugged. Now the side-effects : I need more sleep, sleep longer. I feel tired, less fit. Taking Invega for the first time might give you nightmares. And you might drool when you get higher doses. Sometimes a light headache can occur more frequently. When you stop with Invega (or Risperdal) I experienced a little bit of strange movements with tongue/mouth/jaws. This stopped after a few months. And I think I got heartburn (reflux problems) from it. Invega is very effective diminishing the positive symptoms. But I'm not sure about it, when it comes to negative symptoms. Invega makes me lazy, and less motivated - indifferent. I'm not sure about the following fact, but I think it's true : Risperdal gave me a bit of depersonalized feeling (increased it) - like there was a (virtual glass) barrier between me and the outside world (""cloud"" in my head). Invega, resembles Risperdal, but didn't gave me that depersonalization / derealization feeling at all!! I don't feel completely OK yet, but for now Invega provides me with the means to manage my life quite well, without help from other people. 3 mg Invega as maintenance dose is still quite effective. I still long for a complete recovery, although extremely rare when one has schizophrenia. "

She put me on welbutrin, but I was still terribly sick. I was really ready to give up, and go to a hospital.

I quit smoking several months ago, and have had two months of acute bursitis in both hips, so no exercise. So I have gained about 5 lbs, and think it's the combo of those three things.

They are extreme fatigue, feeling anxious,very worried,depressed, numbness in hands and feet, sore muscles, blurry vision and frequent urination. I am not sure why this has occured. I am going through a really hard time also. My father is not feeling good at times and I get so upset cause he is very important to me. Also my hus band says he will be leaving me to go home to his country which will leave me in charge of finances and a new place to live. They say stress can cause depression. I am seeking the help of my psychologist and my aunts,Dad,cousins,Uncle and my sister.  I think also my sleep schedule is off. I don't go to bed until real late and sleep in alot. The weight gain from the invega worries me the most its about 40 pounds. My doctor told me Invega is not a weight gaining drug and that is not true bcause I WAS VERY THIN IN THE BEGINNING. My husband puts me down cause of my weight and that makes me depressed. I really was doing better when I was fourty pounds less. I had more energy then. But that was also before I got the news of my Dads serious condition and my husband saying hes leaving in the future. Im going to review the effectiveness of Invega and side effects with my Pschiatrist as soon as possible. I have appointment on June  6.

It controls my deep, dark depressions, paranoia, and delusions. I was initially taking Risperdal, which caused me to develop tremors.  Invega provides me with the same results as Risperdal without the side effect of tremors. I was initially taking 6 mg a day but started to suffer from mood swings and paranoia. I am currently on 9 mg and am doing fantastic. I am very pleased with the effects of this medication and would recommend it to anyone suffering from bipolar disorder. I initially gained 20 lb while taking it but I am now carefully watching what I eat and exercising and the weight is slowly coming off.

I am 49 and have had bad bi-polar since I was 7.  I have literally tried all the drugs out there.  This is the only one, besides Depakote (1750mg daily,) and Klonopin (6mg, daily) to slow my manic episodes down.  I don't like the weight gain, as I have gained 25 lbs. even with heavy exercise.. When I have low points I add in 100 mg of Pristiq and I am fine for about 6 months.  It's a balancing act that I fall off way too often.

Was switched to 9mg and the thoughts and my attitude have drastically been affected positively. I also take zyprexa (low dose), I have not seen any weight gain from Invega. Invega makes me very drowsy initially after taking the pill so I take it at nighttime. Underlying drowsiness throughout the day. I am able to go to college and do all my work well. Do not feel like a zombie like on other anti-psychotics. Has been a good experience for me. Earned a 3.7 GPA last semester in upper-division classes.

I've gone through about 7 doctors and even more medications.  The dosage that has finally been successful the past 2 years has been lithium, lamictal, and invega.  I used to take geodon, but my personal feelings of distress (more physical than anything else) made me beg for something else.  And then, whala!  A new drug called invega.  I soon was able to study for school better, my relationship with my then girlfriend now wife went to new heights; I even have been able to sustain a job for the past two years, all while buying my first home at 25 and a new car.  I truly attribute invega for giving me the stability to be myself again.

I'm not paranoid and my thoughts are not racing at all. I was on abilify, and I went out of the range of abilify and fell into a manic phase for several months. To say the least it was horrible. My current doctor put me on invega and I like the fact that I seem to be more sound and not manic or paranoid. However, now I am very sluggish and lazy. I feel depressed and I have gained a lot of weight.  My body just seems to me weighed down all the time. I also easily get indigestion now. I am also lacking focus and have a terrible time doing basic tasks like getting dressed of doing the laundry. I take it in the morning along with an anti-anxiety medication. I'm going to talk to my doctor about all of the side effects that I am experiencing to see if there is another medicine out there for me. It would be great if I could find a drug that gave me the balance and clarity of invega and the pep that I got from abilify. I had no weight gain when I was on abilify.

I tried everything-Geodon-Seroquel-Resperdal-Melleril and others.  Nothing worked.  Finally I changed docs and he put me on Invega-3mg-didn't work then 6mg-better but still not the best then 9mg-great.  No more voices and I don't have any side effects.  Only problem is over the 3 years of trying different meds I developed constant anxiety. My doc put me on Xanax ER.  Which may not be the best for someone who used to use drugs but, I haven't used since age 20 and I'm 47 now.  No side effects with Xanax ER either. And I still have slight anxiety but, I live with it.  As for the weight gain  on Invega I don't have it but, I have a very physical job so that may have something to do with it.  I also tried Depakote and gained 25# in 2 months.  The most important thing is no voices and I can live a ""normal"" life.  After 3 years of trying Thank God for Invega."

Than, because our society tends to think in terms of ""more is better,"" my therapist increased from 3 mg to the next level of 6 mg and, subsequently, I crashed and burned almost as immediately into the negatives as I had during initially taking the meds. After about 2-3 weeks of decreasing mood, depressions that I had not felt in a long time, I got word to him about the change and he told me to go back to the 3 mg. I did, but the negatives remained so I did the drastic and stopped altogether. However, I have been off them just 2 days, again with no change, but just retook my dose this second after reading all the rad success stories on here. I know meds act differently for each person, but I also know I am obnoxiously impatient and it is soooo difficult to wait out the meds before feeling better."

I just hope I can get my life back afterwards. Depression has been a big issue and I feel dead. I don't see how anyone else can tolerate being on this medication. In the beginning it was not bad, but the side effects just kept on getting worse and worse. Today I'm a shell of my former self. Id rather have hallucinations and delusions than live like a zombie. If I was forced to take this medication then I'd rather be dead. I will quit cold turkey next month and I expect a wild ride. Maybe some day ill experience happiness again. Until then, I'm absolutely devastated and miserable.

There is pain at the injection site a few days after the injection but after that pain subsides and get back to feeling normal within about five days Still fighting every day with delusions and regular schizophrenic things that tend to happen with schizophrenia but I am starting to realize that not all of them are actually real Iâ€™m starting to finally feel like the cloud is been lifted and I can finally differentiate between what is real and what is imagined.

Nothing to say anymore, dumber, fatter, weaker, loss of emotion. Heart pain, hurts to stand on feet, back pain, constant runny nose, sneeze all the time..memory is so shot. Sometimes I lose balance, had some painful acne. Hospitalized because I went blind with white light whenever I stood. Almost got lost in the parking lot because I couldn't see anything. Also sometimes have trouble putting words together, and I have brain farts where I forget the numbers or facts even though it was a couple seconds ago. Can't learn new materials no matter how many times I go over it. All I want to do is sleep, work is such a chore and I do barley any hours. Now I forget my dreams minutes after having them. Floods your brain receptors and stops them from firing, so brain dead is a literal statement. Also I developed such anxiety, I always think the worst is going to happen. Never had it before the injection. Can't swim anymore my arm doesn't contract and retract on the left side. As well I got OCD like it's so annoying, I always count like 2,4,6,8,10...all day. The only time I don't is when I sleep and I can't help it. Parents and psychiatrist forced me to take this since day one I never wanted to take it. Violated for life! It has a long half life but that's just blood not fat any your brain is %60 fat so I feel the dumbness lasts forever.

I don't take this medication but,my teen daughter does.  She just started taking it two days ago and I am slowly seeing results she still paces a bit but, very sleepy at times and seemed very sad/pouty for about 5 minutes and came back to being ok after I reassured her and hugged her.  They are taking her off some of her oral medications as she slowly adjusts to the injections.  The only thing is that she seems to have an extra healthy appetite but, if the voices go away or diminish substantially then it will be worth it.  I just have to keep her active in the meantime.  I don't let her mope around I will invent any reason I can think of to get her out of the house.  My only current concern is that she seems more like swollen than anything not fat but swollen.  I hope they come up with an inverna injection that does not cause any weight gain because that would make a young teen or any person truly happier and more active.  Before all this meds my daughter was 105lbs and now she is about 140lbs. she is 5ft 4in tall.  My daughter just turned 18.  
Question 4 should have the option to differentiate between the patient and caregiver personal stats information.  I hope the government gives more money for more research on mental illness.  It seems that mental illness is the stepchild illness when it comes to overall funding.  This and denial on the part of some families due to fear of stigmatizing their loved one has created an epidemic and its time we let go of that nonsense and talk openly about mental illness.  There is nothing to be ashamed of if you or someone in your family has mental illness of any kind. "

My adult son was like a caged animal on this stuff.  He would scream, hit his head with his fist, and kick holes in the wall.  His hallucinations were so creepy that he frightened me.  Every time I'd tell the doctor how awful it was, she'd say he needs to take the next dose, then the next.  He took it 6 months.  It was the most horrible six months of our lives, not to mention all the damage done to my home.  In case you might wonder, he was not using illegal drugs and not drinking alcohol.  We recently had testing through an orthomolecular Dr and learned that my son is under methylated (high histamine) and zinc deficient.  Don't know if that had anything to do with his problem on this med.  None of the meds have worked for him, but Invega Sustenna was absolutely the worst.

It has been a really rough ride. He has tried a lot of drugs and even this one once before. As the dosage was lowered he got worse and the voices never left anyway,so we tried other drugs. Recently we came back to this one after I read a review on this site that one reviewer's voices didn't leave until after 5 months of use. I was hopeful to try it again. And sure enough between 5-6 months the voices stopped all of a sudden! He still talks to himself a lot, but says he is just used to doing so. He watches tv and plays video games, and goes out in public more. He also takes Cogentin, which helps with eye muscle spasms which started on some of the other drugs, so he just stayed on it. Overall, I am pleased with this drug. He is taking the 234 injection every 3 weeks.

With all medications used to treat mental issues one must take into consideration substances such as caffeine and time of usage, alcohol usage, age, how active(exercise,even if only walking of course in moderation), combinations of other medications, illicit drug usage, etc. and there are many other basic factors for which to identify and bring into the equation. Help yourself by using moderation in all situations basically. Common sense is not to be discounted as worthlessness! 
This medication has caused me some side effects such as diarrhea when raised to the 234mg dosage but for only about 3 weeks and then gone. It can cause as well as any other basic anti-psychotic weight gain(solution, exercise a little - go for a walk -a- bout regularly, but not to the exreme; walking is therapeutic anyway). Think about this: I can gain weight whether or not I have a mental issue; is that not true?
Having been given these shots for almost a year now, I believe this is one of the best medications on the market for my particular mental issues: bipolar I disorder, anxiety, borderline personality disorder of which there really is no medicine. 
For sure I started having anxiety issues as early as the 3rd grade and then at 14 full blown bipolar I disorder and was not diagnosed until 18; I am now 55. Medicines for abnormal mental issues have advanced beyond belief since I was first given such. 
Too often there are 2 evils: the problem for which medications are being given and the cure. A good internal medicine specialist in the field of psychiatry can be priceless and it goes w/o saying that communication to others w/similar infirmities might shed some light.
As is always said, ""Different strokes for different folks"" is very applicable. There is always hope; do not despair. Hang in there and have a good! "

They didnt work because I always forgot to take them and so I constantly was in and out of Psychotic episodes. Felt a difference after the first injection. The voices began to quiet. Was very sleepy in the beginning. And moody, but not raging. Mellowed out over a few months. The facial twitches and personality glitches started to fade away. I was able to interact with my family again and now have a great relationship with them that I cherish. I love my kids and am learning to function as a mother and a provider for the first time on my own in a safe an loving way. This drug truely has saved my life and the well being of my children and their upbringing. Unfortunately it has come with a price. I have gained 76 pounds in 7 months. My thyroid is effected. I have abnormal heart electrical signals. High blood sugar. I stop breathing in my sleep. I have constant swelling on the arms legs and feet. I look like Im 8 months pregnant. I sweat and am constantly hot and dehydrated. I get hives and skin rashes all the time. My face is swollen and puffy. My vision is blurry and I cant hardly taste my food. Seems the side effects are piling up faster and faster lately and Im totally bummed out about it. Im suffering through them because I have tried literally dozens of other medications that havent worked at all and this is the best I have found. For those that havent tried it, you should. Its great. Its peace of mind for those who havent had it. And a chance at normalcy. For now, the side effects wont stop me from continuing to take it. Im seeing a specialist to help. Ill keep you updated on if there is resulution. Its the best I have found in 20 years.

233$Condition: Schizophrenia$6/3/2012 12:54:35 AM$Reviewer: Taylor, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This medicine has worked great for me.  Before getting on this drug, I was very psychotic and nothing was helping.  Then when I started this I could tell a little difference, but after being on it for 5 months I'm experiencing hardly any symptoms and I'm feeling normal.  This has been a great drug for me.  When I first started using it I was very sleepy, but now I only get sleepy the day I get my shot, after that I'm good.

After trying other drugs I found the pills are fantastic in making one feel alert during the day. These are slow release tabs so you may have to take a sleeping pill to get to sleep. Now I've been taking the injections for two years. The first six months it takes a little more effort to stay awake during the day though with me this day sleepy feeling decreased. However I can still take day nap though the main reason for that is simply being bored in that I'd rather take a nap than stay awake. Night sleep is normal and you probably won't need a sleeping pill. On doses the first day seems the same as the last and there are no extreme highs or lows. I take the 117 dose. When considering the alternatives there is no other drug I'd rather be taking. Lucky for me with my insurance I can get three doses for $125."

I've found I can think very clearly on this drug. I recommend taking no sleeping pills on this and maybe only one cup of coffee in the morning. Don't smoke or drink alc unless maybe a little drink once in awhile to help you sleep. Don't eat things that can make you nervous like excessive sugar. I take the 117 dose and consistantly feel good as long as I sleep at least six hours a night.

I was hallucination free for over 4 months which a small win for me.  I've been hearing voices since age 17 and I am now 25.   The voices are mildly coming back for several weeks now.  I am now able to study at the community college now and can concentrate better.  I have been on pretty much any mental health medicine you can think of since age 14.  The only medicines that have worked besides Invega are Risperdal Consta injection, Geodon, and Depakote, but I have to say the Invega injection is the best medicine I've been on by far.  As far as side effects I get hot and flush sometimes but it goes away maybe a half hour later.  This medicine ha changed my life for the better, I almost feel as good as I did when I was a child.

My son has been on this shot for about 9 months now and it has helped his symptoms considerably; he is more communicative and is resting better on this medication than any other he has tried recently. He is also on lithium as well. He still talks to himself some and paces around the house at times but considering how poorly he was doing on some of the other meds itâ€™s a major improvement. He is able to set down and enjoy watching a little TV or play video games now where he wasnâ€™t before this medicine. Be careful with any of these meds and good luck.

I am the mother of a 20 year old son on Invega Sustenna IM for 6 months.  He has not had any weight gain but he is more sleepy.  The drug has dramaticly lowered the voices but has not eliminated them all together.  The mood swings are reduced significantly but don't forget he is still a young adult.  
I as the care taker love the once a month injection.  I am no longer concerned with him being compliant with his medication.  
As a care taker I highly recommend this medication.  It is expensive but Medicaid does pay for it.  
Good Luck!!"

She started having extreme side effects, muscle tremors, involuntary muscle movement, drooling, difficulty swallowing, weight loss, not being able to open a water bottle or any kind of bottle. I thought she had early signs of dementia no it was invega trenza. So upset it worked for her and the injections we're so convenient if you know anyone schizophrenic it's so hard to get them to take their medicine. I took her off the injection myself. It's not worth it she wasn't even driving anymore she forgot how and didn't have the motor skills to drive a stick or the muscle strength. The Dr now says it could take 4 months for side effects to get out of her system or they can just be permanent now. What kind of life is this for her and I the one that takes care of her. She's on a medicine that is for side effects from Parkinson's disease and that's helping her. Hopefully it's not permanent. There has to be some other way. She's worse off now than when she was having schizo symptoms. Now do we have to deal with all that and hallucinations, paranoia etc. I hope not.
