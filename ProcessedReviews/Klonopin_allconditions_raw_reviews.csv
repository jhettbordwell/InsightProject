0$Condition: Panic Disorder$5/27/2019 2:47:41 PM$Reviewer: KJC77, 35-44 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$4$This med helps but I don't like the long term effect on the brain especially short term memory loss. I'm taking a med for ADHD which helps my mind stay sharp and a low dose of Zyprexa Zydis to control irritability and panic attacks while getting off this medication. It does the job to stop panic attacks but not everyone responds to this med in the same way. Over several years I went from taking 6mg of klonopin to 1.5mg of klonopin. It is a very difficult med to get off of but I only recommend you take it if you are in constant state of panic and terror. My life went from having panic attacks which led to depression and eventually led to bipolar disorder. I'm tapering off the medication slowly but I don't know if I like the way I'm feeling. While tapering off of it, I've noticed that I am more antisocial(nonviolent) but I think this is temporary till Klonopin leaves my system. Be careful and choose your medications wisely. I hope you find peace in your life.

4$Condition: Panic Disorder$12/17/2018 9:19:08 AM$Reviewer: Howdy Doody, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication saved my life. I suffer from crippling arthritis and failed spinal fusion. I was taking diazepam on and on for 20 years with opioid therapy. I was stable on them. Suddenly my pain doctor did not look at my medical history and see that I could not take SRI SSRI having tried them all. The fentanyl insert states benzodiazepine therapy is reserved for people that cannot take SRI drugs. A more knowledgeable pain doctor recognized this an put me on clonazepam. I had been off the valium for 5 months and nearly died. The CDC opioid prescribing guidelines are actually Guidelies.

I spent every waking hour with racing thoughts. One dose and they are gone! I use them with fentanyl patches because I cannot take any SRI, SSRI because they cause serotonin syndrome and clonus.

It will cure anxiety and panic attacks but it will destroy your life because the addiction to this drug happens before you know it.  When you don't have it, you are in hell.  Read what Stevie Nicks said about this drug.  You have been warned.  She said it destroyed eight years of her life and it did the same for me. I had to hold to rehab and my withdrawal symptoms we're worse than herion addicts.  As soon as I got out of rehab,, I went psychiatrist shopping to get a prescription back bcz I was a zombie without it.  I lied and never told the psychiatrist that I was in rehab for this drug.  It will help you at first but then destroy you in the end.  Run away from Benzos.

This has been the most effective drug for me, no side effects like drowsiness. I have cut down to about 0.25 mg fairly easily , so don't get scared by those who write crazy stories about withdrawal symptoms! Just go slowly. 
8$Condition: Panic Disorder$5/22/2018 2:49:08 PM$Reviewer: nancyj, 65-74 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I took this medication for aout 10 yrs (.5 mg tid). Then my psychiatrist changed to Valium because he was concerned about Alzheimers. After several months, I started having panic attacks again, and Valium was no help. He put me back on Klonopin (same dose as before) with no mention of Alzheimers, Klonopin has made it possible for me to keep on living and to WANT to live. I can't be worrying about withdrawals or Alzheimers -- I'm happy to be alive. Main side effect: hair loss.

Why is it legal to prescribe?  It is cited to be potentially fatal and there seems to be no benefit to it for anything, a drug that's listed as harmful.
10$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/15/2018 11:56:14 PM$Reviewer: Articfox, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I first was prescribed this when I was 20. I had ocd issues however could not handle any ssri's so doctor prescribed this. It worked wonderful. Took 2mg 2x a day along with perphenazine 2mg 2x a day. Had no side effects except for sex drive declining. Even drank beer with no issues.  After 25 years of this the pills just stopped working and I fell in withdrawal. Now I try to take them but I get the reverse effects and all the side effects My world is crashing and been homebound ever since Jan. All my original disorders are back as well. Hopefully  diazepam can take it's place. Better than hoping too grab a lucky pill out of the bottle which doesn't work. I had no clue this was an additive drug but need something after 2 months being off it. Wondering if I should take anything at all at this point however, the panic I am experiencing is really bad to the point becoming dizzy every day I wish it worked again. Be careful with this drug but it really is spectacular when it does work

12$Condition: Other$10/31/2017 10:58:48 PM$Reviewer: tinguy67, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I suffered from mild tinnitus for a couple of months after a loud explosion at work. It was slowly lessening, but my family doctor prescribed klonopin to help in the meantime.  At first it was great, the tinnitus went away completely.  However, after a couple of months on the medication, I started noticing memory loss and confused thinking.  My doctor told me to taper for 2 weeks and get off the klonopin, because apparently this is a common side effect.  5 days after cutting 1/4th of my dose, I began experiencing painful muscle spasms in my limbs, and 2 days later I felt like someone poured boiling water over my skin.  I went to the ER and found out that nuropathy (feeling like your skin has suffered a severe chemical burn) is common when coming off of klonopin and other benzos, and the ER told me it and the muscle spasms would go away in a couple of days, once the klonopin was out of my system.  It didn't.  Not only did the burning sensation get more severe and widespread over the next several weeks, but my tinnitus came back 100x worse than it was before I started therapy.  A month later I went back to the doctor when the issues didn't subside, but the doctor insisted that since the klonopin was out of my system, it couldn't be causing these issues.  It took 3 full months for the nuropathy and muscle spasms to finally subside, but my tinnitus is still much worse than it was before i started therapy.  Before klonopin, it was a mild hum.  Since stopping klonopin, it sounds like an airhorn is going off in my ear.  After doing some research, I found that many people have their original condition get much worse after benzo therapy.

At first it seemed like a lifesaver, but after a few months, it didn't seem to be helping, so the doctor doubled my dose. 
A few weeks later, my panic attacks went from a few times a month to almost daily, and were much more severe than the ones I started taking klonopin for in the first place.  The doctor told me to cut back down to my original dose, and my body went crazy - muscle spasms, intense panic attacks, loud ringing in my ears, and nauseated all the time.  I would give anything to go back to my ""old"" panic attacks, which for years only hit once or twice a month for a few minutes at a time.  These klonopin panic attacks are lasting for hours at a time, and I am basically housebound between the panic and the physical pain.  I am now slowly tapering off this medication, dropping .1mg at a time every month.  I have read that it is actually quite common for klonopin to increase anxiety and panic attacks.  Why didn't the doctor tell me this could happen?"

19$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/18/2017 4:50:47 PM$Reviewer: Special Someone, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I've been on this for about a year. Very low dosage and take only when need. Works much better when I'm having an anxiety attack take 1/2 of a 1mg and I calm down within minutes. Only when I take regular is when things seem sad, I feel sorry for everybody, I'm more scared than normal. All I do now is take half and pray it works wonders. Now I'm barely taken the half because God has made me feel more better. But if I do have a bad attack I know I could take 1/2. Try to only take when you are having a major attack and half gives you more control. You take something long enough your body depends on it. But if you only treat a medical issue for that moment your not co dependent. Good luck to all us special people. We truly are one of a kind. Even if we are sensitive. Just take control don't let it control us. We know we need our meds but just take half for each attack.

I have noticed after a day of being a little up, the Klonopin drops the intensity and brain energy nicely to allow for rest and relaxing. I do notice that if I don't take it, because I may not feel like I need it one night, that it is harder to get to sleep. I also have experienced some short term memory loss when taking 1.5 mg (3 x .5 mg) the next day. It has also helped me with anxiety when depressed. Great drug!

My first shrink in 86 put me on Haldol. Oh my God, that was horrible. I was on different medications until 1994 when I got on klonopin. That pill is a miracle drug. I don't have to take it everyday anymore but I always carry it with me in my purse just in case. I do take other meds for depression and they also help but nothing like klonopin. Because I hear it can contribute to Alzheimer's I try not to take it daily. That's all I need ontop of my other mental problems. I would advise anyone to take klonopin for major panic attacks but try not to take a lot of it for long periods. Maybe in conjunction with something else u can take less.

I had to stop taking it 6 days ago, since my doctor refuses to prescribe it any longer.  My primary care doctor, in Brooklyn, NY, gave it to me with no problem. However, since I moved to Jersey, it is a nightmare trying to find a good doctor.  It is my Jersey doctor who would not prescribe it any longer, and the withdrawal is killing me.  I literally feel as though I am losing my mind. Even as I type this, it is as if I am in a dream (or a nightmare), I am dripping with sweat (very unusual for me), my stomach is killing me, I have a huge headache, and am exhausted.  My anxiety level is through the roof as well. Exactly, how long can I look forward to this party? If I can tough it out until I feel normal (although I was on this cause my anxiety was out of control), I cannot decide whether or not I will commit homicide or suicide.

I am much better and I did not have to go on a higher dose. I take 0.5mg. twice  a day. It is the withdrawals that cause the horror stories you hear about. Not the drug itself for me.

At first I took it every day at 1mg doses for the first 6 months. Now only take it when I need it at 0.5mg's. It works great for general anxiety. If you have something such as a major fear of public speaking its not going to kill that anxiety 100 % by itself. Consider taking it with Propranolol. That combination is a miracle worker. But as far as just general anxiety goes Klonopin by itself is great. I've never really had any major withdraw side effects with it but then I'm at a small dose anyways. When I'm taking it I feel really at ease with my thoughts and others around. If you take this please don't be a jerk while taking it. Enjoy the fact your finally not anxious for once and at peace. Some people use it as an excuse to act stupid or annoying. Sure your going to feel nice while your taking it but don't be 'that guy' and give people a bad reputation that need to take it to function normally. You are still in control and your not drunk so be responsible.

I find that if you are ready to go to sleep it is very effective, but if you are awake in the middle of the day, it won't put you to sleep. Nice calming effect without that ""zombie"" feeling.

I've been prescribed it for over 5 years now. It works wonderfully. It really is a miracle for those who suffer from panic and anxiety. It takes about an hour to kick in, but it lasts for at least 5 hours. It kicks in much faster if you put it under your tongue and let it dissolve. Some side effects include drowsiness, lack of a ""filter"" when talking, very slight clumsiness/lack of balance, and very slight memory loss. It works great right before bed if you can't sleep, too. A little goes a long way. Half of a milligram doesn't sound like much, but it is. Klonopin is very potent. Word of caution: DO NOT take this every day. You will get tolerant to it, and you will need more of the drug to feel any relief. DO NOT drink when taking this. You will do things you regret, black out, and not remember anything that happened. I highly suggest, with every fiber of my being, to take Klonopin only as needed, and only when absolutely necessary. The last thing you want is to take 1mg of Klonopin and not feel any relief. And that is exactly what will happen when you take Klonopin every day or otherwise abuse it."

41$Condition: Panic Disorder$7/8/2015 8:52:20 AM$Reviewer: devo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I've taken this medication at several different times in my life due to moderate panic/anxiety. Was prescribed this after taking Ativan which was too strong for me. I would go entire days feeling like i was sleep-walking on Ativan. I started taking .5 mg twice daily and found myself agitated so I started splitting the pills and .25 mg twice daily and I no longer had agitation. After a few weeks I noticed that I stopped worrying so much about things that stress me out. Also had no noticeable side effects. This is definitely a mild benzo and, at least in my experience, doesn't cause the drowsy/drugged feeling that other benzos do. It almost helps without really noticing it's helping if that makes sense. Each time I've taken this I've weened myself off of it when I felt I no longer needed it. Never really had any withdrawal. Lately due to increase work and stress at my job I have considered asking my doctor if I could go back on it.

I have ADHD, ocd, and anxiety. I have taken .5 once a day at bedtime for a little over a year. I have forgotten a few doses but no horror story withdrawals I have read. 
Negative side effects will occur if you don't see your doctor regularly, don't follow the doctor's instructions , have a history of addiction, and / or are mixing he drug with  alcohol  and/ or other drugs unbeknownst to your doctor. This is a controlled substance .  I am also in therapy and we have a plan of treatment. My doctor is very conservative with meds. If you're going to a doctor who prescribes ANYTHING ""like candy"" as described here by many reviewers , then you are putting your life in the hands of a dangerous person, in my opinion . If you're having issues that a psychiatrist deems  serious enough to require psychotropic meds, then you need to be on a track toward healing, not just taking a drug randomly when you feel like it . That's why regular appointments are important. If you aren't seeing a real psychiatrist in addition to the right therapist with a holistic approach when on these serious medications, you're making a big mistake . Medications are only a band aid -a temporary solution to alleviate symptoms until the root of the problem is discovered and resolved."

Please understand that now. Chemically speaking it's just barely a benzo. When I was first prescribed this it was a direct switch from Xanax. Well...that didn't go over too well! Went into extreme Xanax withdrawals, I was sweating so hard (and shaking) that it frightened me - Klonopin was a poor direct replacement for Xanax. I came to learn that Klonopin simply doesn't share all the characteristics of other benzodiazepines. People need to know this upfront, lest they find it out the hard way. The only plus, perhaps, is that Klonopin doesn't have a strongly sedating component. So it might be useful for those wanting to maintain 100% alertness during the day. That's about it. Common side effects characteristic of Klonopin: very glassy eyes and a distinct change in behavior. Me, I became too 'outspoken' while on it. And not in a good way.

The worst is yet to come. 
I too, was amazed at how awesome I was and felt when I started taking it.  There's no question Klonopin works very well. It just works too well...until the dosage isn't enough. It's not that it stops working on your brain, it just becomes confusing to the patient because old symptoms start to re-appear. It's still breaking through the blood brain barrier and shutting down/taking over your Gaba receptors though. The problem is, the brain has now begun to rely on the drug instead of its own calming mechanism, so it needs more. Most Drs just up the dose, which only makes the brain more dependent, shutting down more receptors. 
Klonopin was never intended as a drug to be taken long term, for very good reason. 
I ended up in the emergency room 4 different times b/c I was in tolerance withdrawal. I didn't know I was, until the 4th ER visit to a different hospital. The dr was smart enough to know, to tell me and to contact my dr. That was over a year ago and I've been tapering since then. It's been a roller coaster but nothing compared to now, as I'm at .25mg pills that I'm slowly cutting down each week. 
There's no way to explain the withdrawals. Ive always kept my body as healthy and strong as possible, but this little pill is a ticket to hell. Ive suffered so many grand mal seizures but I'd rather deal with the seizures, than go thru this hell again. 
I have zero respect for anyone associated with delving this poison out.  Honestly, you are all satan's little helpers.

59$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/16/2014 11:44:59 AM$Reviewer: Smash, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$4$I am writing this post to warn all who are interested in taking any benzodiazepan - they can be extremely helpful but are incredibly physically addictive and often times your GP or prescribing physician does not inform you of that.  I was taking Klonopin once a day at 1 MG for about 4 months and then I leaned how addictive it was and stopped cold turkey.  My mistake - I narrowly avoided having a seizure and didn't sleep for almost a week or eat or anything due to the withdrawal.  I went back to taking them and had a psychiatist wean me off of them, and I still experienced withdrawal symptons though not as bad.  So, please be careful, only take it when you need it, and consult with a physician when you choose to stop taking it.  I am currently taking it again - though only as needed, and no more than 3 times a week - because life stressors have been more than I can handle lately.  So, just please be careful with this drug, it can be so helpful but in the long run the cure may be worse than the cause.

It absolutely worked miracles for controlling the panic disorder ( for some reason I prefer to call them anxiety attacks, sounds less severe). Initially I had been put on Celexa & Valium. At some point Zoloft replaced the Celexa, & Klonopin replaced the Valium. Good moves on both fronts. Then, Abilify was added. HUGE MISTAKE FOR ME. While initially I thought I felt better, it was almost like the 'manic' phase of bi-polar. I had a period of time where I made some bizarre life choices, became extremely selfish, but at the same time felt invincible. After one of those poor life choices backfired spectacularly, I made the connection to the Abilify. Switched psychiatrists, she took me off, & things have been much better since.

The second time, one of the doctors recommended I see a psychiatrist. Although I didn't think it was all in my head, I took his advice and made an appointment. I remember being in the waiting room, pacing, wishing I would just fall to the floor unconscious.

The psychiatrist diagnosed me with panic disorder and started Klonopin .5 twice a day. She said it was the drug with the highest hit rate.

My god...I couldn't believe it. After suffering for such a long time, I was finally free of the panic!

I was slightly drowsy for two days, and then no side effects whatsoever except the relief from the horror. The medication allowed me to get back to my life, and glad to do so.

I have been on Klonopin almost 25 years now. I take 3 or 4 mg per day. As the years have passed, and I have moved and gotten new doctors, often they have tried many different drugs, but not only have these never worked, but have made matters worse in a couple of cases.

FMS is complicated by patients not getting to a deep, restorative sleep stage. In my case, my mind just won't switch off at bedtime.

It was like the absolute worst acid trip I've ever been on and no Doctor, therapist or psychiatrist will help you. They will leave you to go through this hellacious withdrawal at home, totally alone. Klonopin withdrawal forced me to have to make the decision of either continue living in a world filled with nothing more than excruciating pain, terror, anxiety and fear or DIE, and I prayed so hard for death. It is criminal that this drug is even legal. And it's worse that not one single professional will tell you a damn thing. The National guidelines for prescribing this Benzo is 2-4 weeks.

In my opinion I would rate Klonopin at the top of all benzodiazepines (and i've tried almost all of them) as it has a relatively long half-life (lasts longer than most benzos). I have been taking .25mg (1/2 of a .5mg tablet) daily for nearly a decade now, and I have had no urge or need to increase my dosage (although it does take discipline to take the absolutely smallest effective amount without wanting to experiment with more).  This dosage, combined with regular cardio excercise, has eliminated what was once extreme debilitating panic/anxiety.  If you're going to start this medication, take small amounts (experiment with the smallest dosage possible that still remedies your anxiety, etc).  Don't ever get into the habit of taking more, and stay indifferent to people, doctors, the media, etc, who criticize the use of this medication. Become comfortable with the likelihood that you may need to take this medication permanently. In other words, if you maintain a small daily dose regimin, there's no need to put yourself through the pain of ceasing the use of this wonderful medication. I am certain it is much more harmful to stop taking this medication than it would be to continue to use it responsibly for a life-time.

If I get angry, then take the Klonopin, 15 minutes later I turn into the nicest person...it is a miracle drug but don't abuse it because you will experience withdrawal symptoms that are awful to deal with but otherwise it is very effective. I have no side effects from it either so that's also a good reason why it's a good drug for me.

Took it as prescribed and felt for once in my life balanced and even tempered...helped with so many of my other conditions as well, gi problems, etc.  Only went off once suddenly because I had a back injury and didn't want to take pain meds with klonipin...never do that again!!! Much healthier for me to NOT take pain meds but stay on klonipin...during most of the year I have lessened the dosage to 1 1/2 tabs per day ....taken 1/2 3pm, and 1 at bedtime.  I cannot take other meds like elavil or nortriptolene ...those make me jump out of my skin and turn me severely depressed.  Have never felt like jumping off a high deck but elavil and nortriptolene did!!! It's all blood chemistry and you must work closely with your health care provider at all times.  Klonipin works wonders for me.  Also be careful though with mixing it with any other drugs...look at the ingredients and any contraindications,

I took it for 3 weeks at 1mg per day and I felt like I lost 3 weeks of my life... as in I remembered it happening, but didn't feel like I was even there. I quit my job, I got pulled over for driving erratically and I cried every night. I felt like there was no way out, and my husband asked me to stop the medication and call my doctor immediately. I hadn't talked to most of my friends, but the one I did told me something hadn't been right but she didn't know what. I've never lost hope like that before. I talked to the magistrate about the ticket I received,  got a note fromy doctor... but it turns out the magistrate didn't even need it. He said he was very familiar with the drug and implied that he wished it weren't even on the market. The only other stories I have heard directly from people are similar if not so severe. The drug even earned a comment on 'Silver Linings Playbook.' I am terrified of this drug, and what it could do to other people out there. Maybe it works for some, but as with any mood drug please me extra careful. I am now on Depakote for mood instead and my anxiety has subsided. Also consider a good therapist before messing around with this stuff.

Feel a light buzz at 1mg shortly after taking it but nothing else.  At 2mg my anxiety begins to get reduced and mood is slightly boosted and every milligram above that reduces my anxiety accordingly but doesn't make me any more euphoric than the 2mg dose.  Mood and anxiety are affected 30 minutes after dosing. Drowsiness kicks in a few hours after dosing.  Memory and cognitive impairment can begin on as low as a 3mg dosage for me since I have little benzodiazepine tolerance built up.  Doses above 3mg, watch out.  Blackoutland and confusion while blacking out (I recorded myself).  Too bad, because my anxiety was actually manageable for those 12 or 24 hours after dosing.  I settle for 2mg doses.  This way I avoid most of the drowsiness and avoid cognitive and memory impairment while getting to feel a slight mood boost and some anxiety relief.

I wish I had never taken it.  I wish the dr. that prescribed it had told me it was addictive.  After taking klonopin for a year I realized I had to get off the stuff...  6 months of hell followed.  I had seizures, half of my face was paralyzed, I had severe migraines and HORRID    panic attacks.  I couldn't sleep.  It was awful.  Now after 2 years after recovering I am somewhat back to my old self.  I still have insomnia and occasional panic attacks that I did not have before.

They are extremely effective in controlling anxiety and panic disorders. They are also extremely addictive. Doctor's like Klonopin because it has a long half-life. Apparently, some people do have a body chemistry that keeps them from getting addicted, or it could be how they take the medication. I have been on Benzo's 19 years. I have CFS. I tried an adrenal supplement for it and it caused the panic disorder. So at age 34 I was put on Benzo's. I'm almost 54 now. The addiction started around the one-year mark. It nearly killed me. Now I wear 2 watches so I can take my morning and evening dose to the second. My body is synchronized to a 3rd watch that I don't set the alarm on so I won't run down the battery. That is the one I take my pills by. Also, because each pill is a different weight I bought a precision scale and I file each pill down to the same weight. But each batch of the drug has a different amount of medicine in it so some months I'd start feeling sick and I had to increase my dose ever so slightly using the scale. AND, pharmacies like to change the brand you're on so that has been a battle. I had a close friend who committed suicide because of her Klonopin addiction. She was an OB/GYN nurse, with CFS. That was about 15 years ago. Now, I'm taking care of my elderly mother who lives with me and still managing my addiction (with the help of a wonderful and very understanding psychiatrist). Oh, my dose is 1mg twice a day. I hope this will help someone. Good luck and be careful.

I have anxiety/panic attacks. My nurse practitioner prescribed this drug (1 mg)for me but after a few weeks I still was having anxiety attacks. According to her she said they should have gone away by now but they didn't. I could tell she didn't want to keep prescribing it to me because she said it could be addicting. So I went to see a psychiatrist who had no problem with me taking this drug. It made me feel NORMAL!!! I don't get high from this medication at all, it just makes me feel normal. I have always been high strung all my life and to me it's been a miracle drug. He prescribes me 1 mg. 2x daily. All I ever take is 1 mg and if I can get away with biting the pill in half and get relief then that is all I will take. I do or did have concerns about addiction and my psychiatrist told me it wasn't an addicting drug as long as I don't abuse it, which I don't. He also asked if I drink alcohol and I may have a few drinks a few times a year or even go years without drinking(just not my thing). He then asked when I do drink do I get drunk easily which I don't. He said for me not to worry about it then and he didn't see me getting addicted. I don't have any side effects that I know of but I have noticed when having sex I have a hard time reaching orgasm. Does anyone else have this problem?? Otherwise to me it's a wonder drug that makes me feel normal and I love that!

212$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/24/2012 9:22:33 PM$Reviewer: jonathan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$highly effective. ONLY for occasional or short term use!  All benzos are highly addictive and effects will wear off requiring higher and higher dosages to maintain desired effects.  Anziety snd/or panic attacks will disapper immediately if you have never used benzos before.  Alcoholics or recovering acohol/drug addicts should only used under physician monitored dosage.  Exceedeing prescribed dosage will result in extreme sleepiness and further the development of addicton.  Withdrawal symptoms mild compared to aocohol or opiates, but if you stop abruptly you will feel highly agitated and will not be able to sleep for several days.  Very useful when needed but long term everyday use may cause more problems than origianl issue drug prescribed for.  Mixing with alcohol or other tranquilizers will cause euphoria followed by deep sleep and can be lethal.

219$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/29/2012 2:14:53 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been suffering from anxiety and panic disorder for a few months now. Primary care doctor tried a few different anti-depressants (Luvox, Wellbutrin, Zoloft...all generic forms) and I've had really bad side effects with them. He then suggested i see a psychopharmacologist(sp?), basically a psychiatrist who specializes in medications. After my first meeting with him he suggested Klonopin for my anxiety. Im to take that for a week, then when i go back, he wants to put me on a different anti-depressant to work hand in hand together.

After about 4 days of taking 0.5mg x2 a day, i have to say i can say that i feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I wouldn't say that i am a 100% cured, but i feel as if i am on the right track. Only side effect so far has been a feeling of tiredness, but I dont mind so much because i never slept well to begin with.

Overall, I'm happy with the medication, and i have a more positive outlook for the future."

222$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/12/2012 11:24:56 AM$Reviewer: Lina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$I was prescribed Klonopin after being on Xanax for 4 years (had been on it on and off for a total of 10 yrs) because it stopped working: no psychosomatic-- Xanax stopped working. Also, I was having horrible diarrhea;panic;depression especially the last 6th months. So I told my doc I had enough. When I stopped I did go through withdrawals (it was terrible!!) like for days but the doc gave me Klonopin to counter/replace the Xanax.  It's a odd feeling after being on something for so long and then not having the horrible Xanax side effects. I guess you can say it's surreal. But I think it's working. I am agoraphobic as well so we'll see how that works for me going to places. Oh and I really don't see how Klonopin makes you go to sleep...At all. I'm on Seroquel XR at bedtime and still can't go to sleep ( that med has not changed)?? I don't know maybe it's calming your attacks down to help you sleep? ;) Me, I can't sleep more than 2 hrs and that sucks:( Maybe my tolerance level's too high? Wish I could update progress but I guess you can't here. Good Luck

Sometimes the anxiety gets so bad that I would shake and cry uncontrollably. At the height of my anxiety, I would pace around the house and start cleaning or doing things to keep myself busy.

The first night I took 2.5mg plus 3mg melatonin, and somehow while asleep, I stood and fell hitting my head on the doorway.  I have lowered the klonopin to 2 taking 9mg of melatonin, and had horrible nights sleep with dreams, hallucinations, flailing, kicking, ect.  Went back to the 3 mg.  Last night I had dreams, talking, and hallucinations.  It is a terrible disorder.  I don't look forward to sleep, and am so tired most every day.  Wish I could find help.  I go to a noted sleep center....the Falk Clinic in Pittsburgh.  I also see a psychiatrist.  No one seems to know what to do about this.  It seems as though taking more Wellbutrin causes my mind to be overactive, so I am only taking 100mg. right now.  Not too depressed thankfully.  Anyone know about this and could advise help?

It has been hell for me, going back and forth w/my doses, attempting to decrease and then having to go back up again due to withdrawal side effects. And I always took the med as prescribed, no substance abuse! its just the way the med is. It is addicting physiologically. Be careful! And be aware that this medication and others like it (benzodiazepines) are best for short term use.

I couldn't have written this,felt disoriented- couldn't focus on any thought long enough to have a good conversation.

Came down with severe tinnitus, ring in the ears.  Could not sleep, maybe two a night and I was taking Ambien CR at the time. My Doctor recommended 0.5mg. and it work wonders. 8 to 10 hrs. sleep. Then I started waking up around 3:00 or 3:30am after being on this amount for 1yr. Tried a couple of times to get off this medication but couldn't do it. So I up it to 1mg. works great. Since I now have control over my tinnitus I want off this. I have tried 5 times to get off this and had real bad results. I have talked with my Doctors about getting off this and he said you need to slowly get off it. I have tried that with a chart that I would write down the amount each night, shaving a little each week then its gets to a point where I'm still on it maybe at .05 to .25 and get hardy any sleep at all for days and walk around like a zombie and just have to go back on it.

My doctor started me on a very small dose of Klonopin, and immediately it changed everything. I feel normal. I can sleep. No more panic attacks. I can think about my upcoming cancer operation without the fear I used to have. I can think and act rationally now without it having affected me or my personality at all. I don't feel tired or ""druggy"", I just feel more in control of my emotions and thoughts now. Some people have side affects, but I haven't experienced any at all. If you are having panic attacks, don't be afraid to let your doctor prescribe it for you.  For me, it's been a wonderful drug that has allowed me to face life with more confidence and less upset."

They do increase with stress and Klonopin causes sexual problems including ED.  However other ED medications, both RX and especially certain herbal found on 'Better Sex Mall' conteract the sexual side affects.  I change dosage between 1 to 2 mg per day and occasionally discontinue for short times without any withdrawal or rebound.  For me all of the side effects expounded have not been a problem.  I have had Tourette syndrome since age 9 or 10 and I'm now 71.  This has been a miracle drug for me and should be given a good try under a physician's care before dismissing it because of all the warnings and expressed side effects.  I am not addicted to it even after 25 years of use.

Within a month, it stopped working.  I built a tolerance to the drug.  What I DID not know was that the drug is HIGHLY physically addictive.  I spoke to a Neurologist who told me that is as addictive as heroin or alcohol.  She told me that it is VERY dangerous to withdraw from Klonopin suddenly. She gave me a slow taper schedule, but it was VERY difficult.  I experienced tremors, nausea, and sweats during the withdrawal period.  After the last does, it took 35 hours to completely leave my system...and the anxiety came back with a vengeance.  This drug should only be used for a very short time.  In my opinion, Klonopin should have a black box warning on the label.

I swore I would never be like that. I thought she should just get over it and I was a little embarrassed by her ""illness."" But one day I was driving with my two children in the car, and out of the blue I had this sense of impending doom, my heart was slamming in my chest, and I was terrified that I would die behind the wheel and my children would die in a subsequent car crash.  I went to see a doctor who, luckily, had some training in the signs of hormonal imbalance and a LOT more compassion than I showed my mom.  I was diagnosed as being peri-menopausal. Klonopin was the first stop-gap for me - it saved me from becoming a prisoner in my home, as my mom had been.  It also helped me help HER discover that this was a medical disorder, not a mental one.(I still feel guilty for how I treated her.)  That helped HER find help as well. I was off Klonipin for years, and started taking it again after breast cancer. Unfortunately I am now on a drug that robs me of estrogen for life)and low estrogen was my problem in the beginning. Having to deal with hot flashes and panic again, my doc put me on up to .5 mg per day (half pill as needed). I don't take it every day - the problem seems to follow a monthly calendar. But when I do take it, I'm able to get on with life: no drowsiness, no drugged-up feeling. The doc did try anti-depressants which actually increased my symptoms - which, he said, didn't surprise him. This medication is my rescue, not my daily regime. I resisted taking it even as often as I currently do, but he said I am not refilling my script half as often as I am allowed, so he said I need to think of this in terms of being a rescue companion to the drug that keeps me from having breast cancer again.

I am hoping that I can be clean off this drug in 4-5 months. For folks who need it fine, but if you can relax another way please stay awy from this very addictive drug. It is far too easy to get and darn tough to stop. I am also going to try GABA (gamma amino benzoic acid) and 5-HTP at night to help. Any Benzo is very addictive and potentially dangerous, seizures and feeling horrific, plus you might end up in an E.R. Use extreme caution. Frankly I do not know why people like Xanax so much, it does little for me except keep me addicted. I'll keep you posted as to how the Klonopin wafers work. I will win this battle, period!

326$Condition: Other$1/3/2011 4:54:55 PM$Reviewer: Copperredgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I started taking Klonopin for anxiety. I had previously been taking Ambien to help me sleep, but as time went by I found myself taking a half an ambien through out the day to ease my anxiety. It seemed the more ambien I took, the more I needed. This had to stop for many reasons and I tried several other sleeping aids in it's place. Nothing worked like ambien and that's when I realized that maybe I don't have a sleeping disorder but suffer from chronic anxiety. Not panic attacks, just anxiety. Anxiety was keeping me awake, not letting me relax and it was general anxiety not related to phobias or circumstance. Anxiety was always just there, mentally paralyzing sometimes (I'd set on the couch for hours worrying and feeling I couldn't move from the spot I sat in)  I made bad decisions, and I was in general angry most of the time. The side effects I experienced from taking Klonopin were sometimes humorous. My friends while speaking to me on the phone told me I sounded drunk. My speech was slower. (I got hassled my entire life for talking to fast) They said I wasn't slurring, just talking slower. A couple of other friends claimed my personality was different and they missed the frazzled, high energy, always spoke my mind if appropriate or not. Changes I have experienced with Klonopin I am thrilled about are: I have more patients in general, I feel relaxed, I have control in focusing on what I need to get done from bill paying to washing the dishes. With Adderal alone I focused on anything in front of me, avoided anything I disliked doing and was often late for work etc.. Taking Klonopin with Aderall has changed my day to day life in the way I want it.... I'm positive and I'm confident there is a solution for most problems. I've never felt that way before. I used to feel trapped when problems came up. Side effects I do not like is my equal Librium is off. Walking in a straight line is dificult sometimes and I am bumbing into people and things from lack of awareness.

She is a physiciatric NP. She put me on Klonopin .5mg am/bedtime and she is weaing me off Paxil to the Zoloft. Let's just say I went from histeria on Tuesday morning to calmness upon waking this morning. I am sleeping well also. I expect to be on Klonopin until I am well on Zoloft and then taper off. If you take yourself off of Klonopin by yourself cold turkey of course your going to feeling it. Make sure you are with a physciatrist who knows meds and there side effects and how they will react with you personally. Good luck with everyone else out there, I know it stinks being on medicine but, at least we have these options.

Once around 10 a.m. before morning classes and once at night around 8 p.m. to relax for the day. I function fine and do not feel like a zombie as others explained. I am able to run 9 miles a week and do 13 hour days of school combined with HW. You want to know how it feels to feel like a zombie than try an antipsychotic med. They will put you on your ... I am able to concentrate in college MBA feel normal and actually am the social me I remember as a kid. I love this med and think it is a miracle. One day I will go off, but for now with all the stress and anxiety from college again it def. helps. I also, take 20 mg. of Prozac and believe this to be the perfect coctail. And, believe me, I have tried every med and type from antidepressants to antipsychotics. This works best for me in my experience with meds for 10 years. Hope this helped.

I was on the .5mg klono for about a month when my Dr. realized I still didn't leave my house for fear of crowds and people he upped my dosage to 1mg 1 1/2 3x's a day. Which was ALOT! I felt like a zombie. So I take 1 1/2 once a day only when I have to venture outside. If I'm going to work I'm ok it's just the rest of the outside world that scares me lol. But I can say when I do have to go out this med works well. I remain calm and don't rush to get out of the store to get back to my car aka safe zone. People being behind me in lines makes me want to harm people sad but true. The symbyax works good for that. ( the violent streaks I have on others ) So and all I recommend this med to anyone who has anxiety. If you don't feel like it's working on the first dose talk to your doctor.

I was put on it after having been given a steroid drug post partum to treat a rash. The steroid combined with my post partum state sent my adrenaline out of control and cause anxiety and insomnia. I am seeing one of the top psychiatrists in my city on the subject of anxiety/post partum. This drug has worked well and worked immediately. I mainly wanted to post this because it seems that there is some confusion on here about how to wean. My instructions were to wean myself (as long as I am not having any problems with sleep or anxiety) by a quarter of a tablet (.5mg tablet) not more frequently than every 3 weeks. That is a very SLOW taper. If anyone is on this, make sure you listen to your medical provider on the taper and I doubt you will experience these withdrawal symptoms that some have written. I was taking 3 tablets (1.5 mg) 4 months ago and am now down to 2.25 tablets. That is only dosing myself down by 3 quarters of a tablet in 4 months. This is how to be safe about it. Just be patient and try not to freak out that you are taking this medication. It is just for a season of life and it will end. Be patient.

What a difference (for me) I was taking 6 mg. of Xanax, I needed an increase frequently. The Klonopin works all day, I take 1 mg in the morning and one at bedtime. It does leave me a little tired in the morning, But I feel like I have my life back. All drugs of this nature are addictive. I just don't have that paniky feeling if I am running low or leave the house without it. For me..... It's been a miracle! But, we all react differently to any drugs....

I was literally on the edge of suicide because of the constant and uncontrollable pain this put me through.  I was taking Valium before I got pregnant but after my son was born, it wasn't working the way it did before.  After many ER visits, the doctor on staff that night recognized my problem and prescribed me Klonopin along with Amitriptilene- to take a night - and since then I have had no migraines and feel like a NORMAL person again.  I feel so overwhelmingly grateful for this drug.  When I first started taking it it made me a little tired during the day but it's been several months now and I feel great.  I only take .5mg twice daily and it doesn't work acutely like Xanex, but I no longer need the acute drugs like I used to.  The best part about Klonopin is that it isn't addictive like Xanex and I only have to take it twice a day to feel calm and about to focus on my son and our needs instead of having panic attacks all day long.

I have tried about everything out there and I promise Klonopin is the best thing to keep your anxiety at bay.  My dosage is 1mg 3 times a day.  You have to take them, even if you don't feel nervous to make sure they stay in your system.  I had to learn that from experience.  These don't work as fast as xanax to ""calm"" you, but they last longer and if you take them correctly you will feel like a ""normal"" person again.  I don't feel tired or groggy at all.  As a matter of fact, I can't tell I'm on any medication  I just don't feel nervous anymore-and isn't that the goal!!

I started getting them at 23 yrs old. Beforehand, I didn't even know there was such a thing! I thought I was having a heart attack (other panic-disorder sufferers know what I mean!) So, for YEARS, I would have an attack w/out any outside trigger or reason. I stopped drinking coffee, alcohol, and even thought that I was causing them from eating high-fat foods!! I had no clue. I tried all the Vitamins, minerals, herbs (esp. Kava, and Valerian) commonly recommended for anxiety; minimal to no relief! Tried dieting, exercise, meditating, even candles and soothing Music! NOTHING, nada and zip! Then, at 28, I finally had medical benefits, and saw a psychiatrist. Long story short: I was prescribed Clonazepam .5mg twice daily for my dreadful high anxiety. (I was also prescribed Adderall for ADHD and Remeron for Insomnia). Within 1 hr, I felt so much CALMER, RELAXED, MELLOW, and slept like a baby the FIRST DAY! Virtually no side effects either; just a little drowsy and sleepy the first 3 or 4 days. ZERO PANIC ATTACKS! I researched Clonazepam thoroughly and am well aware of all the bad rap it has got: Abuse, withdrawal syndrome, dependence, etc. Everyone's inner-chemistry is like a box of chocolates: You never know.. blah blah! Trial and error; works for some, paradoxical anxiety for only 1% of patients, the 'o-my-god-I-have-to-take pills' 'phoebes that try to stop taking the very solution that works....Duh! Yet, I know it doesn't work for everyone (they can have my Valerian--it's gathering dust!) Bottom line: Communicate w your Doctor!! And, If Clonazepam works, it works! Period! I've been taking it for well over a year, and I have FINALLY completed TWO COLLEGE SEMESTERS! 4.0 GPA! How's that for a 'side effect' of an anxiety-treatment plan? I rest my case. Clonazepam (and Remeron) has really helped me live a more productive life free of debilitating panic, insomnia, and anxiety! I even stopped drinking! Just beautiful.
394$Condition: Other$6/26/2010 8:08:08 PM$Reviewer: malcharpac, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Ive been having anxiety issues for a couple of years since ive had my son and he started getting into things.  I tried zoloft before this drug and my husband and I both noticed the difference.  Im on 0.5mg twice a day if needed.  So far ive only had to take it once every other day.  My body is very sensitive to medicine so the doc started me on a low dose.  I dont know if its adictive but the way i see it is if it helps me deal with everyday things and my 3 and 2 year old grow up knowing that mommie loves them and is okay, then its worth it.  Both of my kids are a handfull and i didnt have anxiety this bad until after i had my son.  Id rather be on medicine to deal with my energetic kids than put them on it.  And the good thing is that now my world isn't upside down.  Sometimes we have no choice but to take medicine.  As much as I hate taking medicine I LOVE MY KIDS MORE.

This is coming from personal experience.  I have wanted to die when I tried tapering off.  Another thing to be AWARE of is that the SSRI and SNRI pharmacutical companies may claim they are not habit forming - WRONG - just as hard to quit. Of course everybody will respond differently, but my honest opinion is if you need help only use meds minimaly and look for other methods, such as therapy, excercise, yoga, etc.  I am not a doctor nor claim to be a medical expert.  I just have personal experiencs and have done exstensive research regarding these meds.  If they change brain chemistry - most likely there will be fairly severe side effects when deciding to quit.  I hope that helps.

But I also notice that whenever I take it, my mood improves considerably with just one dose, my anxiety decreases, and I'm actually able to relax for once and not feel like the world is suffocating me and everyone hates me. I battle depression, along with anxiety/panic attacks, and fibromyalgia/rheumatoid arthritis. It's a lot for a 25 year old to deal with sometimes along with the pressures of the outside world. I just wish I still had insurance so I could get a prescription for it and really try it out. It may be just what I need to turn my life around. I'm always in pain, I feel hopeless, I'm scared of interacting with people (even on the phone), I feel like nothing is ever going to work out and and everyone is talking about me behind my back and hates me. I feel like I'll never find a job, or I won't be able to do anything right and get fired. I'm a failure. I'm worried I'll never be good enough to date, marry, or be a mother. I stress out how I'm to going be able to pay back student loans. I feel like my family thinks I'm a loser. I worry about death all the time, my death and losing all the people I care about in my life one by one and not being able to cope with the crushing sadness. I'm afraid to drive because I can't trust the other drivers on the road and I'm afraid they'll hurt me. I'm scared of getting too close to anyone because I feel like if they go away or hurt me, I'm not going to trust anymore. I eat for comfort when I'm nervous, scared, or upset. I chew the insides of my mouth and I pick at my head until it's raw. I let things build up inside me so much that when I reach the breaking point I explode into a fit of rage/depression because I'm not allowed to say what I really feel. I want to do so much with my life but I'm scared and I don't know how to start I don't feel like I'm good enough. Will it work?

I went through phases were I was so anxious I couldn't stop pacing or driving around aimlessly, focus on any work and sometimes I felt like I had a heart attack.  I even went to the E.R. on more than one occasion. (They told me it was, indeed, just anxiety and there was nothing wrong with my heart).  
Just 1 mg of this drug has done wonders for me.  It's also a definite plus that it lasts for 6-8 hours, because than I can rest assured that it will help keep anxiety at bay for  a long time.  I've had Ativan perscriptions in the past and, although it's effective, it doesn't last very long.  If you need a medication for long term use, according to my Dr., Klonopin is less addicting because it lasts for longer so you don't ever feel as if you need to take another one after only 3 hours (hence you do not get a high tolerence, etc).
I have never experienced any depression with this drug, which is significant considering I have certainly suffered from depression in the past.  
Hopefully this helps.  Although you never want to be totally reliant on this drug, when taken occasionally for panic/ anxiety it has helped me maintain an active, healthy and normal lifestyle.  "

Stopped Xanax and then had to restart but at a higher dose to be effective.  Have been on the same dose of Klonopin (0.5 mg twice daily) for many years now.  Keeps panic disorder under control and tolerable as far as physical symptoms, constant doomsday thinking, etc. Klonopin is NOT helpful for specific phobias in my personal experience.

I have tried tapering off several times over the years but always go back to med because my body is highly habituated now.  In my opinion, would have to go to drug rehab to get off of it if I had to.

But I look at it similarly to a diabetic who needs insulin to maintain a normal life. If it helps me to live normally, why fight it?  I am just wondering what the long term use side effects will be.

This would NOT be a drug of choice for anyone with an addictive personality."

I was on Ativan for seven years. The doc sd only take when needed. Well, one night I felt a big panic coming on slowly which meant it may last longer than usual. That was at 6 p.m., I took one as directed, even broke it in half. Forty-five minutes later, my panic was slowly increasing, and I was trying to control it. I looked at the directions on the bottle. My prescription was only for 0.5mg and my Ativan prescription was for 2 mg. Well, since it was now an hour later and my chest was constricting. So, I take another one and wait and hour, then another and wait an hour. Finally, after my fourth one, equaling 2mgs, it still wasn't working. I guess it is long acting because it takes so long to actually start working compared to Ativan. Eight and a half hours later, it started to work, at 230am. My doctor said take only if need be but this medication doesn't work that way for me. I cannot wait 8.5 hours for a Panic Pill to work! That isn't a help, Ativan works faster, now that I only take when I need because I don't want to be carrying around my liver or kidneys in a cooler when and if I reach 80 yrs. old. I have a doctor appointment soon and boy are we going to go rounds about this! I have a life to live in the meantime between panic attacks, so I am getting my Ativan back.

508$Condition: Other$11/21/2009 4:48:32 PM$Reviewer: Bcareful, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$5$"Personally, I've never been ""prescribed"" this drug.  My ex-GF was on Crackopin, along with a variety of other drugs such as lithium, Zyprexa, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Lexapro and a variety of other drugs to treat symptoms of bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety/panic attacks.  

At first, she wasn't on these meds (she was on them previously, but went off for a while).  She went back on, and completely changed over to a different and doped up person.  I realized after a while that she has problems that I couldn't understand, and that perhaps she needed these meds to cope (I'm not a psychiatrist, so I don't know).

Anyway, she was put on certain drugs, she was taken off those drugs if they didn't work, and then she was put on a different combination of drugs to see how that worked.  It appeared that her doctor was playing guinea pig with her, putting her on so many different drugs she was always totally doped up. 

Now, don't take this review as an expert opinion.  Just take it as an opinion of someone who has witnessed second hand the effects of these kind of drugs.  At one point, I took 10 mg of Klonopin and man, I can say it is overwhelming.  I would never do it again.  My GF convinced my friend to try to take a 10mg, and he was all whacked out for 24 hours.  He woke up the next day and was still all messed up.

In conclusion, be very careful when going on these drugs.  They develop dependency and I would want someone else to get into this mess unless it is an absolute necessity.  Question your doctor thoroughly if considering getting on any of these types of drugs."

I took Clonasopham (Klonopin) to deal with pain in my lower legs that keep me awake at night.  It worked wonders and kept my restlessness down.  I still worry about the long term effects, so that is why I discussed decreasing to the point of stopping for a while.  
512$Condition: Other$11/15/2009 1:16:54 AM$Reviewer: KAT2344124, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$3$I started this medication in 2004 after a car accident. I developed muscle twitches at bedtime, which interfered with my sleep. This medication was not prescribed correctly. As I found out this September 2009 from an addiction specialist, medications in this class are meant for short-term use only. Looking back, I can see that many of my physical problems and memory issues over the last few years were a result of Klonopin, but the problems didn't really start until last year when I developed tolerance withdrawal. Now I am off of it completely. Please google this drug before you agree to take it beyond two weeks. It has stolen 5 years from me. There are reasons why so many people seem so dramatic online. Think about why they're saying it.

In my opinion, it is given out to easily, prescribed at high doses for too long at a time, and is highly addictive if used for most two weeks. I've been going through withdrawal for weeks and it is only the beginning of what I will endure. Just watch the videos on Youtube or Google Klonopin Withdrawal and you will be horrified. I have suffered just about all of the things that they say ""may"" happen, including losing complete feeling in my lower body for 6 hours and flailing all over the place. They thought I was seizing and having a stroke. People, DO NOT GO ON THIS MED OR ANY BENZODIAZAPINE! I have never used drugs in my life; not even weed. And I am addicted to what I consider the worst family of drugs there is. You can't go to detox as you can't stop cold turkey. It is a process that can take years. My life has been so effected by this. I've lost communication with my children and have developed agoraphobia from this. I don't have a life. I am alone. It sucks. Oh, I have beautiful to my waist hair and it is falling out. So tell me, WHY are doctors allowed to hand this stuff out like candy? I didn't know it was even addictive as both of my doctors told me that stopping it was ""no big deal"", AND I BELIEVED THEM. I realized I was no longer anxious and decided to stop....that is when the hell began and I almost died. Thank you for reading. "

So if you start this medication, make sure you have a back up plan, because if you don't, you can find yourself in a world of hurt. And worse yet, you start becoming unstable again and if like me, other drugs are unable to be taken, well, what can you do.  It's not like good people want to take potentially addictive drugs, the other drugs worked, not without the ""life endangering"" side effects though. It would be great to take them, but I can't. Till then, I'm struggling to find a doctor to get my medication, (Klonopin), which has been working well for years.  If you're not a drug addict, this drug is a life saver."

Originaly the neurologist decided since they weren't as serious as they could be just to have me monitor them and if the seizures continue to go back and see him about anti-seizure meds which he didn't want me on due to side effects. About a year later I noticed I had severe panic attacks that led me to convulse so I went to E.R. which they thought the episodes were caused from anxiety so they prescribed me xanax. Been there, done that, and all that is is an addictive habit and a way to put you to sleep. It was my family doctor who suggested Clonzepam/Klonipin 1 mg. per day. And it worked great! However, as any meds go you get immune to them and now I take 2 mgs. 3 times daily which I also came immune to so I figured I would  take them as needed so I didn't have to rely on them at all times and they work better when I start to feel as if I'm going into panic mode. Needless to say, they are great but could always go up on mgs. for us who cant feel them anymore.

I used to take 2 mgs every morning and every nite.  Now I only take 0.5 mgs as needed.   There are certain circumstances that increase my anxiety, and I have to take my med, other than that I can go without it.  I believe that if you need to take a med to have a normal life, go for it.  If people want to describe it as an addiction, then, so what, as long as it improves my quality of life, I wouldn't care that much.

THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH PANIC ATTACKS IS TO DEAL WITH THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A PANIC ATTACK. ALLOT OF PEOPLE WILL WORK THEMSELVES INTO A PANIC ATTACK BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT A PANIC ATTAK. THE MORE YOU THINK ABOUT THEM THE MORE PANIC ATTACKS YOU WILL ACTUALLY HAVE.

After trying without success to get sleep with Neurontin and other meds, klonopin was the best for me.  Getting to sleep with RSL and neuropathy is a miserable experience and I almost went crazy not getting sleep.  Now I take 1mg. at bedtime and fall asleep and sleep most of the night.  Occasionally, if my symtoms are bad because of bad sugar control, I may have to take a prescribed Talwin to be able to sleep without kicking my legs.  I am very careful not to do this often so my AC1 level is okay when checked every three months.  But, as every diabetic knows, there are times of illness, tension or unwise food decisions that can cause neuropathy to be worse.  But the Restless Leg Syndrone is very bad on occasions and only the klonopin works for me.  I have sleep apnea and am very careful to follow my doctor's orders and use my CPAP as directed.  To sum up, yes, klonopin works for me and if it helps keep me from having panic attacks, great.  I am not anxious about using it as long as I have to right blood tests to keep check on my liver, etc.  Sleep deprivation can be miserable and dangerous.  I am so glad I have a doctor that helped me find something that allows me to sleep.  My mother has used it for many years and it has been very beneficial for her.  I ""am"" my mother's daughter!"

It really helps me focus.  Also significantly reduces my frequent onslaught of overwhelming brain activity that keeps me distracted and unable to focus.  I recently started back on Klonopin after being off for several years.  The only downside is the addictive aspect of this drug.  It is extremely important that you wean yourself off very slowly.  The manufacturer recommends reducing your dose .125 every 3 days.  I would follow that advice if at all possible.  When I was on it before, I just stopped taking it, and was almost hospitilized...having some of the worst out-of-body feelings and physical ailments I've ever felt.  Be careful when stopping use!!!

Without it, I'm sure that I would have committed suicide.  After the Zoloft ""kicked in,"" I had no need for the Klonopin anymore, and had no withdrawl problems or side affects at all.

It is so addictive it is the only drug besides alcohol that can actually kill you if you stop taking it without a doctor supervising.
This can mean that some people who have never abused drugs can end up in a detox center if they have been on a high dose for a lot of years. I do not understand why the drug companies have not found something as effective without the deadly side effects.  It's pretty sad that heroin, cocaine, meth, all illegal drugs do not have the risk of killing you while detoxing but something legal and prescribed does. I do believe there are many people who really need these types of medications but I also believe they are overperscribed as an easy fix to panic attacks. They should be a last resort only and doctors should tell the patients how highly addictive and deadly they can be.  I have honestly seen it ruin lives, and I will honestly admit for all my anger against benzo-diazapans I am still afraid of being off it.I would recommend people to try DBT therapy, it has helped me and I plan on continuing it to help me cope, your phychotherapist/counsler should be able to do this for you. In DBT, patients are not told that their feelings are wrong, but rather that they need to find a more positive way to manage them,They learn mindfulness,stepping back and being conscious of the moment without judging it as good or bad, and other emotion regulating skills, so that their feelings have less influence on their behavior.
They also learn distress tolerance,coping with situations as they are -- and methods of self-soothing and distraction. It has worked wonders for me!"

For the first month being off klonopin, I was fine...then, w/out any warning my anxiety came back even worse than before. It was so bad, I couldn't sleep, couldn't breath, and was feeling extremely moody and even suicidal. Since I've been back on the meds, things are better but now I only take maybe 2 per day and try not to take any before bed since when I do, I feel totally useless the next day. I don't want to wake up and worse...get out of bed. If I take them during the day, my mood stabilizes somewhat and I can make myself get things done that I need to.

The medication has worked fairly well for both conditions, and the only side effect is mild sedation when I take it midday.  My nightly higher dose (2mg) helps me sleep (and keep in one place during dreams!!), so I don't have any criticism of it for that usage."

I went to go see a doctor (an MD by the way) he told me there was nothing wrong w/ my heart, and of course because my age he told me that those feelings I get didn't have to do with the heart. He assumed that I have a Panic disorder/ Generalized Anxiety. So he referred me to a Pshychiatrist, she diagnosed me and so ironic it was what the doctor assumed. My Pshychiatrist started me on Anti-depressants, and all the above. I went through a whole lot of medications till my Pshyc said ""I'm going to try you on a class of medications called Benzodiazepines"" he explained everything about benzos. So he started me on Klonopin .5 it work ""arlight"" for me. Still couldn't sleep and I was still getting panic attacks here and there. So he increased the Milligrams, from .5 to 1MG. Now I started sleeping like a normal person that has no sleeping disorders, and my panic attacks were supressed. I mean I still got them but they weren't as severe and sometimes I would feel like i'd get one but for what ever the medicine chemistry reason it blocked the panic/ anxiety attack. I say Klonopin is the right medication for Panic/ Sleeping and Generalized anxieties. But like they say ""Different strokes for different folks"" wouldn't hurt to give a low dose of Klonopin a try, if it does its job then perfect, you got yourself a good treatmeant for your Panic/ sleeping disorders... Klonopin is GREAT! By the way (BTW) Iam still on 1mg and it's still working fine for me, though I haven't tried to ween myself off of them, anyone has any suggestions on getting off Clonazepams?
I am very Satisfied."

Xanax would stop the attack almost immediately. But a new Dr. (I moved) put me on this hot mess and I was on it for approx. 12 years. Had PA on it anyway and barely took care of my anxiety. Gradual withdrawing after 6 wks. left me still needing .5 mg a day (was taking 1 mg 3x day. 
Also, it slowed my motivation to do much of anything greatly. Xanax is fast acting and fast leaving while Klonopin is slow acting and slow to leave body. Pretty much back just on Xanax now...not enough $$$ to get me dependent on klonopin again. Besides, I'm allergic to aspirin, Nsaids, etc. so if a Xanax doesn't stop an attack, I know I'd better get to a hospital quick. Klonopin didn't give me that option."

Anyways I can live without fearing another attack and this is the best drug for panic disorders, I have never abused this drug, I take it as prescribed, I would have probably died if he did not put me back on it. I live my life just fine, and as for the methadone I will be off this drug soon. I would rather take my klonopin then the methadone, People have overdosed cause of the mixing, and I dont want to take that chance so the methadone will go first.

Over time, it seems that I actually have needed less and less of it - I don't even take it every night now and I don't feel any withdrawl type symptoms if I don't take it for a few days, but I wouldn't want to be completely without it. It works wonders when anxiety symptoms pop up unexpectedly and thankfully my anxiety tends to come at night anyway - so it has been a good drug for me. No other side effects except sleepiness.

Of course I am on other meds, Cymbalta, Vicodin(Norco), Lyrica & now Klonopin. With this combination of meds, I finally have found a level of relief that has allowed me to function normally. 
Although at first the Klonopin for the first few days did cause morning fog, but didn't last long. I stayed groggy about 30 mins after waking, but I just took it slow. 
Another thing I do is NEVER take this during the daytime, unless I have no plans on going out. 
This will make you drowsy & a little clumsy until after you get used to it.
I have been prescribed 3 times daily, but I feel even at the lowest dose of .5 mg that is too much. So I stick with taking it at bedtime.

Nobody would look at me and think I'm doped up.  So yes it works but its hard to manage the dosage because doctors hesitate to increase the dose of benzos, despite the fact that they really do create tolerance, and they are so helpful to people who don't abuse them, so I don't see why a dosage increase wouldn't be agreed upon.

I initially was started on 0.5mg 2x a day every day for a year and then started taking Lexapro with it.  I continued to take the Clonazepam for another year with the lexapro then decided to wean myself of the clonazepam and just take in on an as needed basis.  It works wonderful for a ""PRN"" (as needed) drug.  I probably take it once or twice every two months and during those times I will take it for 3 or 4 days and then stop and go about my routine till I feel the need for it again.  My anxiety has been greatly under control, it's just every once in a while it creeps up on you and you feel like you can't function.  It's these instances when clonazepam works wonders.  I hope this helps all those with anxiety issues.  I would not recommend this drug on a ""full-time"" basis.  I think it is a great drug to be used in conjunction with another SSRI or SNRI until one that is found that works.  Once the SSRI or SNRI is found to work, the person should wean themselves off this med and then just use it as an as needed medication."

I have always dealt with chronic panic attacks (15 years or so). I have been prescribed every antidepressant imaginable and nothing worked because I am not depressed. I have extremely high anxiety and panic disorder. Klonopin has helped me so much. I used to not even be able to function at work or even in public due to panic attacks and I am fine now. I have had only a couple of mild attacks in 2 yrs. I recently went to my doc for a follow up and I told her I wanted to decrease my dosage to .25 from .50 and I tried .25 for 2 weeks and couldn't handle the decrease so I went back to .50. I am a troubled sleeper due to high anxiety and I went 2 weeks on little to no sleep. Klonpin is great for insomnia. Doc says if I am ok at .50 I should stay there. I don't want to become physically dependant on this drug to function, but it has helped so much with panic and anxiety. I have no side effects and have never had to increase my dose in 2 yrs. I have always taken .50 1X per day. I'm going to try to decrease to .25mg again and see if I can get past the effects. Overall, I highly recommend this drug over vallium and xanex. I can function fine after taking it and feel great after a full night's sleep.

After the doctor gave me Klonopin, I felt normal again the next day.  I was sooo happy!  I've been on it for 3 years now and it still works like it did before.

I have been on this medication for a little over 3 months currently I am taking .5mg. I have had to see a cardiologist several times, not sure if this is doing something bad to my heart. I still have panic attacks even on the medication. I have read all the side effects and I wish I would of did this before trying this medication. My doctor wants me to use paxil I am worried about that medication also. I am reading so many positive feedbacks about Klonopin and wish that was me. When I drive I feel weird also like I am drifting off to another place. I am to the point I fear driving. I also fear being alone thats how bad my panic attacks are. But while I am taking my Klonopin I am very mean and evil. To the point that I dislike everyone around me. I thought for sure that this medication would help me. But I think the medication is doing more harm then good for me. I am praying that my Doctor can help me taper off this medication so that the side effects are not as bad as I have read about. I am scared out of my mind that the side effects are going to be bad.

Both work very well for panic attacks. But, Klonopin 1mg is my favorite because it does not make you as drowsy (like valium) and last for a long time (unlike xanax). I can function normally during the day if I need to take one or even two if needed. Has kind of mild mint taste to it if you bite one in half. Even, helps with depression. I found it better than antidepressants, but it is hard to convince a doctor that. Very habit forming though! No cold turkey if you need to stop!

Helpful for a while, but, in time, found anxiety was increasing.  (Have read up on this medication and found this is common.)  The difficult part was STOPPING the medication.  In a word - HORRIFIC!!! I tapered off with my doctor's schedule, very carefully. I NEVER abused the medication, took .5 mg 3xday as prescribed - but when I stopped it, I went through the most horrific withdrawal ever.  21 days of constant, debilitating anxiety - and I had NEVER had a panic attack before!  In my opinion, you can become addicted to this drug WITHOUT abusing it --the physical and emotional withdrawal was evidence of it.  I see this drug as POISON now - I would NEVER take it again.

I inherited this disorder and know that it will always be in my life, it's something I just have to deal with. I have had panic attacks for 27 yrs, but have only been on Klonopin for 13 yrs. I did have a side affect of not being able to release urine, and was almost catherized, but that went away. I don't think I could handle everyday life without this drug.

It was selected by my (former) psychiatrist because it was thought to be the least addictive. It was somewhat effective, and I did like the fact that it has a long half-life, staying in the system for a long time. However, I did not feel the same relief from anxiety and tension I felt with some other medicines in this same class. Perhaps I wasn't taking enough -- I was only able to inch up to 2.75 mg./day, as if I were taking morphine or something...

That is what they get paid the big bucks for.  If you feel as though your doctor is not treating you in the manner that you feel is appropriate for your situation, then find a second opinion.  I have been battling this for over 10 years now and I have just recently found the right doctor that actually listens to what I tell him is wrong and how my medications make me feel and he takes the time to explain to me what I should be feeling and tells me to let him know if they dont go away.  The right doctor makes all the difference.

If I missed a dose by 1/2 hour, I felt it.  I stopped taking it all together, but within 6 months the panic attacks were back full force.  Dr RX .05 mg which I actually break into 1/4's as needed.  It really does help.  Only problem is, alot of change lately and 1/4 wasn't doing it, so I started taking 1/2 at a time when needed.  Now I try to go a day without any and I just can't, but 1/2 a day isn't too bad.  I'd like to think that once I get through my current stressors I'll be able to get back to 1/4 as needed.

I'm now up to two 2mg. pills b.i.d.  The only negative aspect to the drug is the slurred speech that MAY occur.  For myself, it produces a speedy affect because I can accomplish so much with the panic disorder interference.  This is, in my book, the best benzodiazepine.

This was extremely disturbing for me as I'd never had problems with sleep before.  Dr. prescribed 1mg 1 hr prior to bedtime; said it would help stop my mind from racing.  He was right!  I no longer need to take any sleep medication and I generally sleep the entire night through.  The only side effect that may or may not be related is that I sometimes have strange, disturbing dreams; however, they are not significant enough to warrant my tapering off of this medication.

But Klonopin caused, in me at least, after about 6 or 7 yrs on it from 1mg to .5mg to .25mg (finally off it now), a range of other ""paradoxical adverse reactions"".  Sex drive = increased to the point of sexually compulsive behavior.  Anger / irritability / rage level(s) = WAY up above where it should be...we're talking seriously potentially violent here, on at least a few occasions.  Depression; basically the Klonopin caused, in me, after being on it for so long,  just the typical symptoms of mild (or ""moderate"") depression to set in.  Physically, there was constipation, acne flares, and hair thinning/ loss after the prolonged usage.  This IS an effective drug for treating anxiety and panic,  yes, but,  for me at least,  after finally getting off of Klonopin it has proven much wiser for me to not use any ""benzodiazapenes"" on a daily basis & simply take a .25mg (or actually I usually crack those in half, so .125mg) of Xanax ""PRN""(as needed; that is, DURING, or to prevent, an actual severe panic attack).

However, my Dr. had me stop taking this drug ""cold turkey"" after a month and a half of use because of suspicion of an alergic reaction.  

The withdrawals have been horrible!!  They include psychosis, paranoia, rage, thought disorder, tremors, pain and some of the worst panic attacks that I have had.  So far I have been off of work on sick leave for a week and I have found a new Dr.

I strongly recommend against stopping this drug ""cold turkey"".  Since I have had some spare time I have learned that I haven't experienced the worst withdrawal effect of the drug which is seizures.  I feel like I am over the worst part of the witdrawals and I look forward to returning to work.

I started at .25 three times a day, then after a year, went down to .25 twice a day, and now I take .25 once a day.  Thank god for this drug!  I started having anxiety attacks two years ago, and have only had one in two years (and it was a situation that would cause anyone to feel anxious, so I wasn't too worried - did some Yoga and felt much better).  It worked from the first day I took it.  It works quickly, and for a longer period of time than Xanax and Ativan.  I'm taking Effexor XR as well for anxiety, and it's been a winning combination.  I'm weaning off the klonopin because it makes me sleepy, and the Effexor is working well, but I am really glad this drug was available when I started treatment.  I was really depressed when the attacks started, thinking I'd always be limited because of the fear of having an attack and this worked so well, within a week, I was back to my old self.  I will still take it on an as-needed basis for the occasional bout of anxiety.

The long term affect of the daily dose kept me at an even keel unlike Xanax.  Weaned myself off, with Dr.s knowledge.  Decreased a 1/2 dose every two weeks until I stopped.  Side Effects:  I was sometimes clumsy, fell a couple of times...shattered my kneecap, tripped up stairs and down.  Then I read it adds to Osteo. Am now exercising, eating healthy.  Doing my best to control any panic attacks that I feel may be coming on.  Of course, therapy during that time helped me...deep breathing, subtracting 3 from 100, walking, drinking water (this is during a panic attack.  I have only had the beginning of a couple panic attacks since.  Have been off for two years, now.  But you should have a therapist you can trust, who deals with panic disorder.  Meds can help, but I found that learning to live with a disorder you can try to control through therapy has saved my life.  I'm not saying I will never use Klonopin again, because if I need to I will go back on it.  I loved the calm feeling it gave me.

I have an extremely stressful job, along with being a full-time student so things can get pretty hectic.  All I need to do is take a dose of Klonopin and it calms me down without feeling ""high"" or ""out of it"", and allows me to focus on what I really need to do.  Also, it solved my sleep problems when taken at night.  On the down side, it (along with Celexa) has made me gain almost 50 lbs--time to hit the gym.

930$Condition: Other$12/11/2007 8:54:29 PM$Reviewer: [email protected], 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"I have been using Klonopin for over 3 years and I read on WebMd that it should not be used for over 3 months. I have slight jerks when I don't use and or when I was put on it. I just want to know which is true.  My condition started with head injuries; starting in 1965...since then I have had 5 injuries to my head...nothing to put me in the hospital butenough (Ithought) to cause me to lose my balance. I've gone to several Neourogists, had MRI and MRA but each Doctorwinds up doing the same thing...walk..scratch..do you feel that and continue taking Klonopin..I'm 77 in good shape excpt for my knees and my balance.  Is there a clinic or a GOOD DOCTOR here in Calif who I can go to that will help I now walk with a walker because of falling down,,,but around the house (unless I'm in a hurry) I use a cane.
Thanking you in advance.

I am on a 0.5 mg dose as needed for panic and anxiety attacks. It made me drowsy when I first started taking it but now that I have gotten used to it I can handle it. That is the only side effect I have experienced. I like it because if doesn't make me feel drugged like xanax or valium did.

I have not been on any medication in more a year and am glad to say I have not have any unpleasant side effects. Klonopin did work wonders for anxiety, BUT and this is a huge BUT. Was extremely addicted to this after being on it for a year. Was ""fired"" by my therapist and I went online to learn how to ween myself off of it. I recommend it for anxiety because it works but it's very addictive and made me very tired to the point I would just dose off to sleep. Felt like a junkie. NEVER stop this medication abrubtly.  And if I missed a dose would get the shakes. I emphasize that it does work extremely well but you will become ADDICTED to this medication so be mindful of this. I weened myself off of it SLOWLY and didn't experience any withdrawal symptoms.  I have changed my diet and only eat ORGANIC and whenever I get a little stressed I go the health food store.  They sell homepathic medicine that works just as well for my anxiety and sleepiness without the negative side effects. The organic diet help cut out the intense food cravings I was having. BUT never ever stop taking your medication unless you consult with your physican first.  I don't knock tradional medicine because it helped get me through my rough time when I got divorced and lost my home and everything else I valued and felt like I wanted to end it. I still have ""talk"" therapy and I would still use traditional medication if I need to but I felt I was on klonopin too long and shouldn't have been on it that long. And if it ever gets to point again I would defintely use if it I had to again.  God bless everyone one of you.  Having a mental illness is not easy but just know that it will get better and eventually the sun will come out again. If one medication doesn't help don't give keep trying until you find something that works for you.  Not all medications work the same for everyone but eventually you find something that works for you.  "

Anyways clonazepam is great, it last 12 hours in your system instead of 6 hours like alprazolam (xanax) and the clonazepam is the best benzo/tranquilizer out of all the benzos. Anyways if you have bad seizures, really bad sleep paralysis like I have or have crippling anxiety i recommend you talk to your doctor about this medication.

Ok so when I take my Klonopin it allows this water to break out of the dam wall and release about half of it. Klonopin is a great med to take but it's better to possibly not take it daily as you will build a tolerance  to it and even have bad, odd side effects. As you take it daily the med will continue to build up in your system, build and build until the concentrations are way too high. So I've discovered it's better to take 2 or 3 days off from time to time in order to get the drug out of your system a bit and then let your system reboot, and then when you take your next done it will feel much better and help your restless anxiety much better than consistently taking every day. Nice to get that reboot from time to time, trust me. When using it responsibly at your lowest effective dose, whatever that may be, depending on you, it should really help zap your restless, anxious racing mind and intense anxiety! Like I stated above,  it'll let that dam break its wall a little bit and release and relieve the pressure in the mind and even body and the worst of the dreadful anxiety. Be aware this is a very addictive drug, therefore you must really have a need for it like intense, uncontrollable anxiety, racing, agitated mind etc. If so, it'll help you but make sure to let your system clean out and reboot from time to time for a couple of days and it'll work the best like that. For me this is the best way, for you it may or may not but if you're dealing with a long period of intense, non stop anxiounsness and restlessness caused by mental issues etc, I'd give this a good try! I personally like the generic Mylan brand, other's have better luck with a different clonazepam such as Teva etc. My 2 cents. Talk to your doctor 1st of course as I certainly am no medical professional.

It will make you feel very groggy in the mornings as it has a fairly long half life. When I was taking 3 mg a day I found it had an affect on achieving orgasm during sex. Overall it is a proven medication and I would recommend it especially for those who have anxiety issues or restlessness. I have never found it difficult to stop taking but you have to wean yourself off it very carefully. Do not try to get off any amount of it cold turkey.

Then I have to be slowly tapered off of the Librium. When I was introduced to clonazepam, I was never told just how addictive it is.

It still helps my RLS about 90% of the time. I'm on 3 a day of the 1 mg and I really think I need mine increased but I don't know if my dr will increase the dosage to the 2 mg. I think the 2 mg in the morning and 2 mg at night would do the trick. That's one pill less a day but it's also 1 mg more a day if it's changed to the 2 mg. I've had RLS since Id was 17 and I've been on carbidopa levodopa for it at first and after about three weeks on that my legs got so bad at night. That medicine made it worse so that's when I changed dr's and was put on the 1 mg 3 times a day. It also works great for my panic or anxiety attacks. I think I having a heart attack when I have those episodes. But if I take a clonazepam it will knock out my chest pains and jaw pain and arm pain in about 20 minutes. It's scary because I'm at the age that I could be having a heart attack and think it's just anxiety.

1043$Condition: Panic Disorder$2/18/2016 2:56:30 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$In 2010 I was prescribed Clonazepam at 1 mg three times a day for severe anxiety/panic attacks. My wife was terminal with cancer since 2005 and was given 3 to 6 months to live after the initial surgery. She had 3 more surgeries and 5 rounds of chemo treatments and after each event I was told 3 to six months. She lived until 2011. I was already being treated for clinical depression (since 1995) and was in terrible shape. My doctor prescribed the Clonazepam and referred me to other options to deal with the anxiety. It really helped when the 'other' non-medical options failed to keep my mind in check. This med actually kept me from killing myself. Unfortunately my condition did not improve with the death of my wife and under close supervision of my doctor I remained on the Clonazepam until January of 2016 when the VA, whom I have been under their care since 2013 when I moved back to my home town, mandated that anyone using Clonazepam and any opiate had to choose to either stay with the Clonazepam or the opiate (I have been on morphine for degenerative discs). You could not use both because of the possibility of developing breathing problems. I had been taking both since 2010 and have not had any problems. The VA prescribed Hydroxyzine Pamoate at 25 mg twice a day. It has not helped my panic issues at all. It just makes me very sleepy and is giving me sinus headaches behind my eyes. I've been on this shit for two weeks and cannot function at all. I'm to damn drowsy and so damn agitated that I haven't left my apartment in a week. I looked up that med on WebMD and found out that the main function of it was for sinus issues, not panic attacks. Note: I can't take antihistamines because of 'another' medical problem I have. I am at my wits end and need to get this resolved before I end up taking that dirt nap.

I started with one mg. pills, one in the morning, one at night, along with an anti-depressant at night.  It did help me calm down, but did little to help me sleep.  My Dr. then upped it to 3 times daily, then 4 times daily.  That's where I am now.  One time while on this med, I found myself between Drs. and had no refill.  I went 2 weeks without it, I had major hallucinations, sweating, headache, body aches, etc. and ended up in the hospital for 3 days.  I was off them for awhile.  But, my panic attacks came back with a vengence, so I was back on them again.  I imagine that I will be taking them the rest of my life.

It is an extremely effective medication for panic disorder, general anxiety, and OCD for me.  I am 52 years old and after making planes turn around in the sky and 4 hours in security (pre 9-11) as I was certain my plane would crash, I was prescribed it starting at one mg a day.  After having a panic attack in traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge and getting out of my car to practice my breathing techniques at the rail of the Bridge, with people screaming ""don't jump,"" it was increased to the level I now take. (Fortunately it was late 1990's and a adorable Dr. In a Porche recognize what was happening and calmed the situation). So no arrest...  Lastly, I want everyone to know, one must tritrat off only with your physicians care and very slowly.  The withdraw symptoms are horrific when I tried once.  Eyes bouncing around shakes sweats etc.  this is drug dependence not addiction.  I also do not believe it to be an acute medication but not sure.  Xanax etc. Give me a hang over feeling the next day or. Headaches mid day.  Drinking and taking this mediation will make a person forget - memory loss.  Just make sure you follow Dr. 's advice to the letter.  Oh yes, and during the withdrawal if too fast, one can actually have seizures- even if you were not prescribed it for any seizure disorder like Epilepsy.  Thank you for reading this."

With the help of Clonazepam, I was able to attain a therapeutic level of Zoloft and maintain it.  Once my anxiety and depression were completely under control, I started weaning off the Clonazepam, .25 mg at a time, until I was taking .25 mg a night for sleep.

While you are on it, it works great at first. What they don't tell you is that this drug causes major withdrawal for a large number of patients when you decide to go off of it. You have to taper off it like you are on heroine. It took me about 2 years of excruciating withdrawal effects to get off the dosage I was on. It even says on the box that the drug is not recommended for long term use, however doctors tend to ignore this. There are other treatments for most of the conditions that this treats so my advice is to try anything before this.

1105$Condition: Other$5/8/2014 12:17:14 AM$Reviewer: Wade, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$"Initially this drug seemed safe and useful. I started this drug for anxiety and stress. Unfortunately, I had been extremely misled of its danger. The prescribing doctor eliminated it too quickly and then cowardly denied its correlation to seizures of my jaw radically chomping during the night, severe insomnia, panic attacks, thought process disturbances, and much more miserable consequences. When searching for what was wrong with me so desperately, I went to over twenty doctors that denied such possibility could happen until one that diagnosed me with Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS). Now, not one doctor can or has denied its correlation to my very ailing condition. I've never felt as though I was going to die so many times in my life, and I almost have many times. Had I known about its brain damaging factors, I would never had touched it. Stay away from this drug. Too many doctors are not managing it well and setting people up for misery on top of misery down the road. This will be the cause of your panics, and much worse. My condition is possibly lifelong. It also made it to where I cannot feel pleasure whatsoever and more severe consequences. Thanks docs. 

Do your own research and do not trust the loosely prescribing doctors that try to convince you that it is safe for long-term use when it is not. 

One well written NYU report link is http://epilepsy.med.nyu.edu/treatment/medications /clonazepam

The Ashton Manual is also a great reference book that most of the world uses except the US.

Do your research before you use this drug! I was stuck on this drug for years. Don't let it happen to you!

Avoid this drug if you can!"

After an exhaustive and frustrating search for answers to, ""what exactly do I have and why am I not getting any better?"" After being misdiagnosed and having so called ""Pain Management Specialists"" send me to Psychiatrist's who misdiagnosed me and started and kept me on medications that have terrible side affects such as constant dry mouth, skin rashes, swelling of the tongue (so bad I could not speak)and the list goes on. This PAIN was NOT IN MY HEAD as I was told point blank. RSD/CRPS causes your sympathetic nerves & central nervous system to report REAL NERVE DAMAGE & it reacts to this by causing a ""Hyper-Nerve Stimulation"" which the BRAIN CANNOT HANDLE! Victims of this incurable disease/disorder or syndrome know how this manifests itself physically and this ""Hyper-Nerve Stimulation"" also causes our BRAIN to over-react to common stress ""Hyper-Sensitively""! Forget it if you experience major stress like the loss of a child or parent spouse. That's  when we experience ""flare-ups""! If you are unlucky enough to have foreign surgical objects such as metal screws,plates, etc. inside of you then watch out when the barometer drops and the weather changes because the PAIN,BURNING,NUMBNESS,JOINT & EXTREMITY SWELLING,HEADACHES,MIGRAINES,INABILITY TO THINK AND REMEMBER,TREMOR, MUSCLE SPASMS, SWEATING and INFLAMMATION,(PROBLEMS URINATING in my case) are part of the ""Internal Storm"" reacting to the ""External Storm or weather front getting ready to come through.

I have an Rx to take a 1mg tablet twice a day, but usually half a tablet in the morning will work, unless I anticipate having a horribly stressful day. 

In order to not develop a tolerance or dependence on this medicine, I take ""days off"" from it, maybe two days a week, when I know I have little to do or few obligations that I know I can get through on my own.

Both my parents suffered from mood swings which i did not understand at the time. Eventually at about the age of 20, my mood swings started to developed, but ony lasted for a couple of days. I visited my doctors about my systoms, but was never taken seriously. Most shrugged their shoulders and moved on. After my divorce and consequent remarriage, my wife began to become concerrd about my mood swings and suggested that I see a therapist. I did this but it did not help. 
Now at age 45, symptoms became more frequent and I recognize that I was becoming more like my father concerning his rapid mood swings.
Fortunately, I met a doctor who took interest in my concerns and actually spent over an hour with me listening itently to what I had to. After running serveral test an reviewing my medical records, he suggested that I try the drug clonazepam @ 2mg 1x.  I don't know if this was co-incindental, but the first night a took clonazaepam, i had the best night sleep that i have had in 35 years. No leg pains, no rumination and felt like a rejuvenating person again. I have been on this medication for about 4 years at the same dosage, but the effectiveness seem to be lessening.

In fact, valium, the kidney stone pain medication and anything that kills the pain and helps the condition has been taken away caused by teen and young adults misuing it and I despise them for that. Now that the clonazepam has been weakened, the spactic colon is coming back.  They also tried a drug called Serax at first but the Valium was much better for calming my colon.
Surgeon told me I would have the diahrrea al the rest of my life.  It has been 52 years that I have been medicated for this condition."

I was quite impressed with how much this helped to relax my muscles, however I found that I need to take this at night no later than 7 to 8 hours before I need to be up the following morning. It is really helping better than the muscle relaxer. I am a person who has been on pain meds for over 15 years due to a car accidenct where I was rear ended and have so many things wrong with my back that it is hard to find ways of dealing with the multiple types of pain due to multiple diagnoses. I advise everyone I speak with to not give up and keep fighting for your rights especially when you are dealing with doctors who seem to think they have the manual to your body and know your body better than you do. Keep fighting for what is right for you no matter what anyone else might think. I have been fighting for my own rights for many years and have finally found a team of doctors who seem to listen to what I have to say and seem to understand my frustration of many years of dealing with doctors who don't seem to want to understand and/or deal with my issues. I have even had to deal with doctors and SSI tell me that I am too young to be having all of these issues. Whose right is it to say that anyone is too young to have any type of medical issue regardless of the issue or what caused it or your age. KEEP FIGHTING FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU PERSONALLY!!!!!!

I have shortness of breath, major anxiety, insomnia, metallic taste in my mouth, and awful headaches. All in all, this drug is not worth it.

And do not stay on this stuff for more than 2 months or less.  You will be fighting off really bad withdrawal symptoms rather than getting relief.  I am sorry I ever took my Doctor's advice  and started taking this drug.  Clonazapam is one of the strongest benzodiazapine along with Xanax (per the ASHTON MANUAL) and for long time users it can take a year to taper off (per the ASHTON MANUAL).  Please take as little as you can."

Whereas it once had a calming effect it now has a ""stimulant"" reaction.  Dr. wants me to stop it now.  Tapering off has been a nightmare. The whole withdrawal things are felt in 12 to 24 hours for me and just get worse. I wish I never heard of this stuff.
Reports on getting off this stuff gradually report that it can take up to a year, with some withdrawal effects remaining with you the whole time. It is clear I have a high tolerance now to Clonazapam and all I am taking it for is to stop the withdrawal symptoms.  So ... 5 years later, my Doc. decides he wants me off it. Five years!
I think I will not make it. Depression/Anxiety has been to long and I hurt physically and mentally. I will try to see if I can take this horrible stuff for the rest of my life.
I may have to cause going off it, I've been told it can cause life threatening events such as seizures that don't stop without major medical intervention ... like getting all kinds of drugs IV to stop the seizures before you die or worse, suffer brain damage.
If you are on this drug, get off it within a month or two ... or you will become addicted. Then you are lost, as I suspect I will be if I can't take small doses for life. "

Although it worked well at first, I needed higher and higher doses over time to achieve the same level of efficacy. This worried me and I decided to stop taking it. Even with a doctor's supervision and a very gradual dose reduction, I still experienced horrible withdrawal symptoms. I would strongly advise against EVER taking this drug, even for a short time. The road to dependence (both physical and mental) is a quick and slippery slope. An outstanding web site to look at is www.benzo.org.uk. You will find out about clonazepam's adverse effects, what withdrawal symptoms can occur, and learn about a time-tested method to get off of it. It's best however, to never take it in the first place.

Better for treating insomnia than for in-day anxiety relief.  I prefer Valium during the day; it provides just as good anxiety relief but makes me less drowsy.  10mg Valium is equal to approx 1mg of clonazepam.  I find Valium and Klonipin to not be addictive but found Xanax to be very addictive.  All of thes bentos will build up in your system and can turn you into a zombie quickly, so stick to the prescribed dosage.  I think that is 4mg/day for Klonipin and 40mg/day for Valium.  Summary: if you find it doesn't relieve your anxiety, or is too sedating, ask your doc if you can try Valium.  There's a reason Klonipin is not indicated for anxiety!

During that 6 months, I told my Doc 3 different times that I was feeling more anxious and each time he upped my dosage.  So, I finally gave up and stopped taking it. On April 19, '02 I had a seizure due to the quick withdrawal of chlonazepam.  That was my fault.  I'm thankful I wasn't driving at the time!  

Then, September of last year another one of my docs gave me chlonazepam again and within TWO weeks I had to be hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and I made slices down the whole length of my left arm with an open safety pin because I wanted to die but didn't want to kill myself.  I had also been on Ablilify for a year which made me feel restless, nervous, and anxious.  

In the hospital my new doc took me off chlonazepam and Abilify and put me on seroquel and prozac.  I was hospitalized for 3 nights. BOTH times I took chlonazepam I felt extremely suicidal!! I've been on my new meds for a year and feel better than I've felt in my whole life!  My body does NOT react well to chlonazepam!!  I will NEVER take it again! 

I AM pleasantly surprised that so many people gave GOOD reviews for it.  Glad it can help people even though it made my life a living nightmare."

I was prescribed this medication by a sleep disorder clinic after a 24 hour sleep test.  I had not slept much in several years and naturally was depressed from sleep deprivation. The doc put me on clonazepam, which is a depressant - right - I'm aready depressed and he gives me a depressant.  I started crying at the drop of a hat every day; that is until I figured out when this crying started.  It started with this medication.  I was only on it 3 weeks and called he to say that I'm going off this shxt! Talk to your doc

I started on this med 10 yrs ago after MANY others failed. It works Effectively for me as long as I take it each morning. I was on 6-8mgs per day YES a lot. Now I only take 2-4mg at most. The only issue I had with this was weaning down to a lower dosage, I had SEVERE mood swings, depression, paranoia and of course Panic Attacks. After consulting with my Psych. aka Dr. she made the process much better. SLOWLY weaning me down without any withdrawal but some anxiety. 
 The only thing that it doesn't help me with is restlessness so I continue to have trouble falling asleep for 2hrs usually 4-5x's a week. Not everyone has the same reaction to medications. This one is though by far the most Effective for Panic Disorder after I've been on more than I can count in the Benzo Family and many others. However, it is the most difficult to discontinue and the withdrawal can be extremely intense. Please anyone using this seek a professionals help and guidance to safely come of this Drug.

I've tried, hypnosis, books, head doctors, herbs, etc, don't waste your time or money on these things for many years, like I did. This is a REAL ILLNESS contrary to what people tell you. The doctors will give you some paxel or celexa and send you home to get rid of you. Unless you have this illness, nobody undestands.
I'm not a pill popper and don't even take asperin unless absolutly necessary. After over forty years I had my doctor prescribe me Clonazepam and it has changed my world. I feel like I did back when I was fifteen before I was druged back in 1969.
I use this stuff in moderation, and if by some chance I get addicted to it, so be it.
This has completely changed my life. I feel like a normal person again. I will literally kiss  Gods feet for finally waking up to this medication.
If you have any of these phobia issue, I bet it will work for you too.

Zanaflex 4mg q1 prn (for spasms)
Cerefolin NAC (L-Methylfolate) 7.5mg/day This new generation of vitamin requires a script although not a drug. It's a manipulated form of folic acid 8 times what you get from the GNC version but ALL of it crosses the blood brain barrier whereas OTC versions don't cross at all! That's why ur pee stinks (sorry). It's expensive & insurance won't pay but anyone on SSRI/SNRI's should be on this. It triggers the brains ability to start producing Dopamine, Seratonin and Norepinephrine! If there's nothing to ""reuptake"" then there's no point in using a re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI like Zoloft/Paxil etc...) Everyone should take this nutritional supplement if they take anti-depressants like Effexor, Paxil, Zoloft, Remeron, Cymbalta, Prozac, etc... The company making this curiously makes an almost identical substitute called ""Deplin"" which one thinks competes with the other, but they're both made by Pamlabs. Go to pamlab.com & can get your discount card cuz it's very pricey. It's a miracle vitamin for me. I had a brain injury because of a fall and lost short term memory retention. Dr's said it would take years for it to return. I started taking Cerefolin NAC w/ my Zoloft/Wellbutrin cocktail and it worked immediately. Both Deplin and Cerefolin work the same cuz the main ingredient is L-Methylfolate. Deplin is marketed as something that helps your anti-depressants while Cerefolin is marketed as early stage memory loss or Alzheimer's but it also contains B-12 and another Vitamin which actually makes the Cerefolin NAC a much more effective choice than Deplin for those taking anti-depressants while in either case, I don't see any value in Deplin cuz u'll need Vitamin B supplements as well.

Then I had something bad happen to me and I went into manic mode (up 24 hours just doing a lot of thing, always remaining busy to not think about the accident).  I got on 1mg of clonazepam because I didn't want to up my anxiety meds.  I only take one @ night if I need it.  It helps me out, calms my brain from thinking and I get a goods night rest and I'm not all manic doing 1,000 things @ once.  I couldn't imagine taking 3 of these a day, nor would I ever want to.  I think I'd be in zombie land, and I need to be productive during the day.  Eases body aches as well.  I do have trouble waking up on these and a little groggy feeling.

With originally Effexor and then I was weened off of that. For about 1.5 years (starting 2 years ago) I only used 0.5MG's maybe a half dozen times total. At that point they were no good and it was me dealing with my panic and anxiety attacks. Obout 6 months ago I went back on them because of losing myjob and issues with getting unemployment payments. Was put on Cymbalta for nervous ticks and this has been only used maybe another half dozen times. when i need it it works great. I never got addicted or needed to watch out that I was going to be dependent on it. I can see a life with very few panic attacks on the horizon soon. I can also say that Xanax only worked for a while for me and then didn't. 
It is also extremely important for people to make sure that they dont up the doses without help from a doctor first. Also if someone is a drinker this med or any anti anxiety med will have less if any effects. 
I feel that this med has helped me so much with another med to control the main anxiety issue plus a little Cognitive behavioral therapy has helped me. I have also by attacking my attacks not relying on this med to cure me. Its all up to me.

But this med is great.

I had been begging my psychiatrist to prescribe a benzodiazepine throughout my treatment. Finally, he did. I have been taking Clonazepam for some three months now, and I can only say that this drug has saved my life. My debilitating anxiety is gone; I no longer have panic attacks; I have returned to college, and I am generally more happy than I have been for years. The only side-effect I have experienced is a slight drowsiness beginning about an hour before I go to bed.
For anyone who has severe, chronic, debilitating anxiety, and is willing to take this drug AS PRESCRIBED, I can only offer my own experience as a full-hearted endorsement for the responsible use of benzodiazepines (such as Clonazepam). I have experienced no cognitive impairments, as my performance at school can attest to."

I have to up my dose as you can build up a tolerance after a while, other than that I love it. On a side-note, it can kill your sex drive.  Also to the guest that asked if you can inject, no you can't. But you can get a dissolve under the tongue pill that is faster acting for panic attacks.

I have fibromyalgia, a rare disorder called Dercum's Disease and severe restless leg syndrome.  I was feeling very restless and jumpy during the day due to insomnia from constant pain and RLS.  I have been taking a low dose of Clonazepam .5 x3 at bedtime for 2 months.  My anxiety has decreased, my pain level seems more bearable and to my surprise my Restless Legs has improved.  I never thought I'd find something to help that.  Over the past 30 years I have tried just about every drug under the sun to relieve RLS and this is the first thing that has made any difference.  I did have some of the side effects the first month but now don't notice any side effects.

The sicknesses that you are experiencing when you do not take your clonazepam is withdrawal. Please discuss this with your physician as soon as possible, as withdrawal from any kind of benzodiazepine can be very dangerous. Your doctor may want to slowly taper you off of this drug before trying another that might work better for you!

I also have general anxiety, OCD. panic disorder, ographobia, and PTSD. I have benefited greatly with sleep. take the two before bed and am able to get several hours of sleep at a time.

My life seems on a wierd even keel, with a flatter affect, less likely to do outdoor stuff and feel more housebound, with some anger issues. I feel it does work for the panic and for the anxiety and sleep. I like, others am scared for when I no longer have insurance and ability to pay. Does seem to help with perception of pain working in conjunction with Lortab 7.5, Baclofin, Tramadol, and Ibuphrophen 600. Am happy mostly but dislike the drugged feeling in the daytime. Has totally changed my sleep pattens. Used to be up early and sleep fairly early. Now sleep until 10-11 am and to sleep around 2-3 am.

Because it makes me sleepy, I can't drive after I've taken it. It helps enormously with general anxiety and chronic unrelenting pain. Taking 1/2 tablet isn't effective, so I take one whole tablet when the anxiety hits. Are there other side effects when using this medication?

1492$Condition: Panic Disorder$6/5/2010 5:55:07 PM$Reviewer: Ethomas99, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $2$1$1$I was prescribed this drug for panic attacks, and it slowly helped to put me into one of the worst addictions I have experienced to benzodiazopine drugs. Like xanax, it made me apathetic, forget to eat, zoned out, kind of a zombie effect. When .5 milligrams stopped working, I started to take 2 at a time. Then 3, then 4, and so on. Within about 3 months I finished a bottle in a day, just to function. I needed it to sleep, to avoid withdrawal which included panic attacks worse than I started with, to be around people, to socialize, to go a day without freaking out. I chewed them to kick in faster, and since they taste okay I had no problem chewing 5 or 6 at a time. This drug brought me to my knees faster than anything and along with xanax, was the reason I decided to get sober. I don't think my history of addiction contributed to the addiction I experienced with this drug, because it is known for making all types of people dependent on it. I would avoid this entire class of drugs for anxiety and stick to neurontin, depending on severity. Or take it only for emergencies or before bed. No good.

Before I started taking it, I never knew what it was like to not have anxiety. It was so bad every day. With this medication I have been able to live a much more normal life and not having the anxiety is great! I am not a fan of taking any long term medication, but with my anxiety being SO bad, this has been a great thing for me. Finally a semi-normal life! It works great for me. The only side effects I have are some clumsiness and about 30 minutes after taking it I get a little sleepy but after that it is pretty much a normal life! I am so greatful.

For the first couple months I did not have panic attacks but it clouded my mind severely. I had trouble driving straight and I fell down a flight of stairs (literally bouncing off every step with my rear). It would've been funny if the situation weren't so tragic @ the time). After just 2 months of taking it I felt no relief and no side effects. It was like taking a placebo pill-it did nothing. I never became addicted. It was no problem for me to get off of. My dr was weening me off but I would skip several days and would be fine. My body is resistant to benzos but have seen A LOT of people having a hard time getting off.

The reason i say this is it is very habit forming. When you have taking it for a long time you have trouble getting off of it. My dr. wonts to take me off of it. I have tryed once and i through i was going crazy. I was having withdrawls so bad that i had to call her and go in. She was scared that i might hurt my self. But i knew it was the medican that was making me feel that way so i would tell myself it was just the medican. My dr. didn't know how to get me off so i wrote the company that makes it was told they didn't know how the help me. I am back on it now. I don't like being on something i can't get off of and the company can't help . They can sell . I got on the web site and try to find someone who might could. I got a lot of answered about it was hard to come off of it but if you could go throw the withdrawls it would take a while. I may try again but not sure i can go throw the withdrawls.  They said that if you was able to get off you may not be able to stay off of it. This is just what i thank. But if you need it take it for a short time or ask for something else. If you are trying to come off it good luck. Try not to get in any hurry just take it one day at a time.

1644$Condition: Other$10/27/2009 5:19:43 AM$Reviewer: chawles, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$"It was hard getting my doctor to prescribe a benzo, as I don't have panic disorder but rather an often debilitating social anxiety. Im taking .5mg 2x a day, a very low dose that belies how effective it's been for me.

In social situations I no longer feel like I'm always doing or saying embarrassing or stupid things; my speech and behaviors are no longer inhibited by a perceived omnipresent public scrutiny. When I drink now, it's not a desperate move to ""prep"" myself for a meeting or party. Instead it's for my own enjoyment. 

In class I engage the professors regularly (often zealously with my opinions) and have become good friends with some of them. I do find it difficult at first to stay awake when it kicks in during a class, but I had that problem before the clonazepam. Perhaps the only negative aspect is the memory loss, an effect I perceive probably more than most people, being a student. The gaps in information, when they exist, are generally negligible anyway.

I've been on 200mg Zoloft for years now (for the aforementioned anxieties and OCD), and yet I always felt that my symptoms weren't completely resolved. Though I am aware of the fleeting nature of benzodiazepines' anxiolytic effects, I have come to terms with the possibility of being on such a drug for a long time. Unless it leads to abuse, the benefits far outweigh the costs of klonipin. I am a better person now, because I don't have to live in fear."

Originally was perscribed 1mg 3x a day.  I only took 1 a day at first and seemed to get a little better after 4-5 days.  Then it was the weekend and I slept through most of that holiday weekend. I thought I should take 2 since I was perscribed 3 a day and after 2 days of that I was groggy all day at work and even fell asleep at work briefly.  After about 9-10 days of taking, I became a disoriented, walking zombie.  
After leaving a work party (w/literally 2 sips of wine) at approx. 7:30, I fell asleep on the train ride home (which happened often while taking the medicine but never before in many years of riding the train).  The conductor woke me up and I knew I was a little tired but never thought I was too bad to drive.  I was leaving a (thankfully) nearly empty train station parking lot and blacked out or fell asleep and crashed my car into a cement light fixture.  It knocked me awake and I thought someone hit me and looked around and there was no one in sight.  That was a Thursday, that weekend I tried 3 (as perscribed) and slept most of the weekend and was groggy for a couple days after discontinuing med altogether.  I stopped the med and called the dr but she was on vacation.  A couple weeks later she had me try much lower dose (.125 mg 2 - 3 x day) but it still made me tired but not as bad and didn't seem to notice any real positives."

It all started about a year ago.  I was out of work for 2 months on medical leave.  I take the drug with 100mg of Zoloft daily and I am a new person.  I was never socially active but now I can't get enough.  I am a totally different person and I no longer have anxiety or panic attacks.  I only take .25mg in the morning and afternoon but it does it's job.  The only side effect is once in awhile I get dizzy when I turn my head but I can live with that.  I recommend this drug to anyon but only in small doses.  When I was at the height of my depression and close to being hospitalized, I was on 2mg and it really effected my motor skills.  I was also on Lerezapam for anxiety and sleep.  You take one pill and 20 minutes you are sleeping very soundly.  Nothing could wake you.  Very good drug while you are getting out of depression and anxiety.

It has the ability to completely destroy anxiety and panic, and may seem like the perfect drug at first.  However, you will develop a tolerance and continue to raise your dose until you reach a point where the drug no longer works for you.  It will cause you problems the longer you take it and the higher your dose gets.  This drug is highly physically addictive and can cause severe and painstaking withdrawal if discontinued, even gradually.  Please be careful and do your research before taking this drug.

The draw back is that not taking the med. for a week or more will cuase withdrawl symptoms. In answering the question this drug is a Class C drug in may states becuase of effects on the brain and illegal use for illecet drugs.

1710$Condition: Panic Disorder$7/17/2009 3:54:32 PM$Reviewer: feeling desperate, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$4$"Clonazepam worked very well the first week. I could sleep for 6 hrs and not wake up in a state of panic with a racing heartbeat.  My anxiety symptoms were calmer too.  But after a week I started feeling general anxiety about situations where I normally have just a little uneasiness.   As the 2nd week went on.. my anxiety grew stronger and stronger.. but when I hit a state of panic attack the drug kicks in and I feel calmer and don't feel the emotional effects of the panic attack.  I do have the racing heartbeat though.. so I take a beta blocker (propanolol) to help slow it down a bit. I was still able to sleep. Until two nights ago when my anxiety about being able to get to my doctors appointment on time woke me up too early.   then I spoke with the doctor about my symptoms and he said I was having daily anxiety withdrawal as the drug started to wear off the next morning.  He switched me to tazepam but the pharmacy wants 430 dollars for 60 pills... who can afford that? The doctor also put me on Citalopram 10 mg yesterday for 6 days and then go to 20 mgs after that.  I took my first pill last night and woke up early so I have insomnia and feel very tired and am subject to anxiety still.  I would like to get off clonazepam soon so I can get some sleep and not feel so exhausted and vulnerable.  
For short term use.. 2 to 3 weeks, this drug is okay. For long term use.. I suggest you use something else."

I have found it very satisfying so far. I have been on other benzo's in the past, such as Zanax and that just made me loopy and tired. Clonopine works immediately but just takes that edge off when I feel the anxiety rising up within me. Plus they taste kind of minty so I just let them disolve under my tongue so that it gets through your system faster. The only thing that makes me nervous is that it can be very habit forming and I have problems with addiction.

1780$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/22/2009 7:13:16 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$4$I started experiencing panic attacks for the first time in my life about a month and a half ago.  I didn't sleep for about 1 week.  My doc put me on serequel 100mg. each night and clenazepam .5 3x daily.  The panic attacks are gone, though I do feel the initial symptoms arize every now and than I can calm myself so it doesn't escalate.  The serequel helped me get my sleep back on track too.  I have recently lessened my clenazepam dosage to 2 pills per day, I did have irritabiliby side affects from this change.  My doc wants me to lessen to 1 pill soon.  I may have same side affects as before, but just hope and pray that the panic attacks do not return.  I think I have learned some things that I can do to calm myself, but I'm not sure if what I have learned has helped or if it's just the meds.  I guess I'll find out as we take more of the meds back down.

It has helped in conjunction with light anxiety.  My only complaint is it's habit forming.  When I try to come off the med, it is very difficult.  I am now again trying to come off by gradually reducing my dosage from 3 per day to 2 per day to 1 per day over a three week period.  It takes approx. seven days for this drug to clear my system.  Though I have had success with the drug, overall I find it has affected my personality in the form of lethargy, lack of mental sharpness, and just an overall drugged out feeling.  If I can get off, I never want to take it again.
1782$Condition: Panic Disorder$3/19/2009 10:57:56 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$It is hard to explain. One day at work I FELT LIKE I WAS HAVING A STOKE. I was 35 years old.I HAD CHILLS,RIGHT SIDE WAS NUMB. I ASKED MY BOSS TO CALL AN AMBULANCE SHE WOULD NOT SO I DROVE MYSELF TO HOSPITAL. As I was walking to my CAR MY FEET FELT RUBBERY BUT I MADE IT TO MY CAR. AT HOSPITAL THEY DID AN MRI THE NEXT DAY ALL WAS FINE.As time went on I would have this feeling in the lower chest where the rib cage comes together. I JUST COULD NOT FUNCTION. I would have to go and lay down and a few hours later I would be ok. I took many trips to er with same results. They could find nothing wrong.I had all the tests MRI,CAT SCAN, BLOOD WORK, CERTAIN URINE TESTS,EKG,EEG,STREss TEST ALL WAS GOOD. SO i TRIED ANOTHER DOCTOR SAME RESULTS. Finally a doctor sent me to a psychiatrist. He put me on .5 mg klonopin one at bedtime. That was it I was cured. But I worry about dependency. So I stopped taking it after a month and the feeling in chest came back, my legs would feel weird and I just felt like I was going to pass out. I am happy go lucky I do not understand. But another psychiatrist said it is how my body handles stress even though you do not realize you are stressed. so he put me on clonazepam .5 mg one a day but i only take as needed. I have been taking for 10 years but the key is take as needed. I take half .5 mg pill as needed. I use about 60 pills a year taking a half pill when needed.That would be .25 mg. Which would be 120 doses a year.The doctor says take one pill a day but I will not afraid of dependency so i take as needed maybe 3x  aweek  it varies. I have not had a trip to ER since. I still feel stressed at times but the pill seems to do the trick. If i took one .25 every day maybe I would be fine all the time but I believe I would have to up the doseage as time went by and eventually it would no longer work. The doctor said he cannot see how .25 when needed works but if it does ok. Believe me it works.

Of course because I don't have great insurance, they won't give me the brand name ""Klonopin"". I did try one and it worked wonders for my severe worry and agitation.

My Dr told me to self-medicate, as I never require more than 3 a day.  I've cut myself to 2 daily (am and pm).  Originally I was given Xanax, and I was taking 5-6 a day, and felt doped all the time.  This has been a great mood leveller.  I still get stressed, but the physical anxiety and panic symptoms are drastically reduced, if not gone.  I am growing concerned about dependency.  Make sure if you're on this, you're getting bi-annual blood work done.

It even discusses it in the side effects and has happened to a dear friend of mine through the last few years!!  Pharmacists said it did NOT cause hair loss....but...here, in WEBMD, the side effect IS ""EXCESSIVE HAIR LOSS"".....or GROWTH!!!!!  BE AWARE OF SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS.....VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!"

My doctor suggested Clonazepam might help with both instead of prescribing two separate drugs. For several months, I slept though the whole night without waking. Now I general wake up due to noises, bathroom breaks, but I have no problem getting back to sleep immediately. No more restless leg problems either except for a couple times when I didn't take a pill. Also, if something important is  happening tomorrow and I might have problems getting back to sleep, I just take two tablets. I have no problems getting up in the morning. I read about some possible problems being on this drug so long but so far, so good. It's like a wonder drug for me.

BEWARE of the addictiveness of this drug, as I was told it isn't addictive, but it very much is.  It worked for many years, but about 3 yrs. ago the panic attacks intensified, and I also developed severe clinical depression, which I am now on disability for.  I have had a hard time finding a Dr. that will admit that the long term use could be CAUSING the depression, which is something I've never had problems with, and then helping me find something else that will work.  If you start this drug, don't ever try to go off of it cold turkey!!!  I'm doing it very slowly, without the help of a Dr..  Can't see any sense in taking something that's not working.  Like I said, it worked for many years.  Also, make sure you find a Dr. who does liver function tests, etc. regularly. In 20+ years, my Dr. has never checked mine once, and from what I'm learning, that is very important.  I recently had blood work done, and am praying for good results.

I was prescribed Vicoden ES , Ibuprofen 800 mg Nexium and some muscle relaxant like Zanaflex. Because of the severe pain and muscle spasms I had very hard time falling a sleep or staying a sleep, The treating doctor prescribed different Sleeping pills including Halciaon , ambien and some other sleeping pills but none worked for me. So I was prescribed 1 MG of Clonazepam for sleep. The clonazepam alone did not help me but taking it together with Halcion made me sleep. It was around 2001 or 2002 from that time to now I had about eight spine surgeries and disk removed and bones fused. Nothing took care of the pain. So I was referred to a pain management Doctor there I was put on Oxycotin, Oxycodone and Morphine this was around 2006. Then I had another lower back sugary and I felt a little better and decided to drop off some of my medication with in a week I was able to quit every thing but Not Clonazepam It was and is almost impossible to quit this drug. I gave it up for about one week and I could not stand up, was always shaking could not hold a cup or anything and could not walk straight I went to my pain mgmt. He told me I don’t have to quit clonazepam because it was a very small dose 
So regardless of need or not I could not quit Clonazepam. Now all the side effects in the book are working on me but I can’t quit. I strongly oppose giving this type of medication to a patient with sleep disorder. Yes my life is like hell can’t do with it or without just read the severe side effects and imagine being living with them by the way all my back pain came back 2 months after the last surgery.To all my co-patients don't take this unless you have the problems it is primarily made for.

This is when I started Clonazepam(Klonopin) and was started at 1mg 4/day.  My body built up a tolerance and I got to the point where I was taking up to 20mg/day just to stay leveled.  I tried going off of it and went through hell and now I just take whatever whenever just to avoid the withdrawal hell.  This med no longer helps and my dr. feels bad cuz I'm only 24 yrs old and he rerets putting me on any form of benzo at my age.  I wish I would've done more research, but its too late now.  I don't recommend this or any benzo to anyone, but as for me I am surprised benzos are even legal drugs through prescription.  That whole category, if you do the research, is one of the worst groups of meds above narcotics and sedatives.  I'm at the point now where I don't know if my miserable depression, anxiety, and fatigue as well as health issues are because of the Clonazepam or what, but I know once I became dependent on it I was done.  I feel awful and embarrased and I feel like an addict despite never misusing or even trying street drugs because when I try to go without it ITS PURE HELL so I give in and take at least 1-2mg/day to keep it in my system.

I wish I had never taken these pills, because if you run out before your script by mail has arrived you start withdrawls immediately so far last years Thanksgiving consisted of me not allowing my husband to leave the room I had no idea what was the matter with me but it was a true hell and now it is happening again because of this stupid mail order prescription service you are forced to use with the current insurance we have and if you don't press that refill button in time you are hurting like I am today and will be for the next 4 days unless my doctor ok's a new script for a few pills to get me thru these days waiting for my script in the mail. 
God bless the postal service. But I have to cancel going to work tomorrow which when you can only work part time is pretty valuable to work the days you can.Anyway if you read this all I can say is be prepared never ever take this pill or you are in for pure hell days now I know what a junkie must feel like and God is it hell. Take good ol valium it has been around forever and I never ever heard or read anything like what this pill does to you hell it got our parents through their lives and are fine now.

1963$Condition: Panic Disorder$6/3/2008 7:57:19 PM$Reviewer: eravenheart, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$2$"I started on Lorazepam but an ER doc decided that it was not working enough because it didn't last long enough.  I ended up on 2mg of Clonazepam a day.  I took that for about 2 weeks after almost 3 months on Lorazepam.  A new pcp decided to cut my dosage down to .25mg a day all at once.  The withdrawal started immediately.  It has not been too bad yet but I'm only in my 5th day.  On the second day I just stopped taking it altogether since it was doing nothing for me anyway (the withdrawal symptoms create their own anxiety).  However, while on this drug, I did not have a single panic attack.  I did experience moderate to severe dizziness at times (especially on standing rapidly or moving my head too quickly) and a severe loss of appetite.  I thought that bad at first but discovered that eating very small portions more often allowed me to gain my appetite back.  Since I was overweight to begin with, this turned out to be good as I have lost nearly 20 pounds.  I have read from others that they take doses only when they feel a full panic attack coming on rather than routinely to combat constant anxiety.  I will be attempting that if I actually have a full blown panic attack.  I'm close a lot of the time right now but know that much of it is withdrawal.  I would recommend that, if you have been prescribed this medication for routine, daily dosage that you talk with your doctor about changing to an ""as needed"" drug to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms.  Also, avoid alcohol when you've taken this.  It really knocks me for a loop.  All in all, it is a decent drug but the addiction factor really needs to be considered before taking.  Good luck to you and all of us dealing with this medication."

We hired a handyman to fix a leak in the master bedroom before we moved in. We came to check on his progress and found he had completely gutted the entire house! The lathe and plaster walls, the antique tile floors and counters,  sinks, toilets...everything. The whole house was in a pile in the backyard, taller than the house. I had to go to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack. They gave me 0.5mg. of clonazepam to take as needed. One pill at night made me terribly angry in the morning. Violently angry. The next day I took a quarter of a pill, same result. Tried again the third day, whole pill, when I woke in the morning I couldn't focus my eyes very well. My eyesight went from 20/20 to 20/200! They had me stop the drug immediately of course, and are scheduling tests to see what went wrong. There may be no connection, but just in case, ask your doctor!

IS habit forming - previously on Valium many yrs ago (benzo also) - MUST reduce gradually as I went off cold & results are shakiness and nervousness.  Did not make me sleepy as I take other Rx for migraine/muscle spasm that are sedating and my body has gotten used to fighting off the sleepiness.

The Klonopin itself is a life saver because it calms me down enough that I can get a decent night's sleep.  The only thing unfortunate about it is that I am sometimes drowsy if I don't get at least 8 hours of sleep (as with any sleeping pill).  I don't take it if I've been drinking or have taken Benadryl for my allergies so I have never had withdrawal sympotoms or adverse side effects.

Given the the dosage prescribed (.5mg), I didn't think it was going to work, given that I was taking 40 mg of Prozac.  Upon taking the first pill I noticed a different within an hour; I slept liek a baby for the first time in years.  When I work up, I felt such a sense of calm that it pleased me--yet frighted me-at the same time.  I went to work for the FIRST TIME with a PLEASANT DISOPSITON; I didn't need to get two martinis at lunchtime in order to get through the rest of the day.  I wasn't SNAPPING OFF at my family that evening. Granted, by the FOURTH TABLET I began feeling quite lightheaded, walking somewhat wobbly.  I ate a good breakfast and some fruit and relaxed.  Of all the meds I have taken over the past eleven years, I have found this one to be working (so far so good). As for the possibility of becoming addicted to the meds, I been through enough enough addictions to such meds that I force my self to rise above it--because I want to get better.  I don't feel I'm in the place to recommend this to anyone; what can be one person's Nirvana can be another person's Purgatory. If you have a good doctor (Primary, Psycologist, other) whom you feel you can trust and will prescribe a med that will work for you (and only YOU), go for it.  But always remember and don't ever forget--the meds are'nt going to solve whatever problems triggering your symptoms--YOU ARE.

I am so sorry I ever took that first pill...I began having problems from the start but didn't think it was the drug and the doctor didn't seem to know what I was experiencing was coming from the drug either.  I would get extremely lightheaded, so much so I could barely function; all I wanted to do was lay around because I had no energy or interest in doing anything, even the most simple things became difficult to do. It also numbs you emotionally and my mind and memory have been dulled.  Take anything but this drug.  No one explained to me that this drug is a class that is not like antidepressants, but it's a hynotic drug.  It should be used ONLY for very severe cases of panic or seizures...not for anxiety like I have and even then for only short periods of time...two-4 weeks. Please don't let anyone talk you into taking this drug.  You willl find it's a living hell if you ever want to come off of it.  From the things I have read, everyone who has tried to come off of it has had horrible experiences with withdrawal due to your whole nervous system being dependent upon it.  Your body is no longer able to function normally.  Your brain no longer manufactures its own hormones because this drug has taken over.  It will take a long time for your brain to begin to make it's own again.  Other organs are affected, also.  I would like to convince the whole world of the dangers of this drug and tell them that any doctor who puts you on it, find another doctor.

The doctor advised me to take the drug only when necessary so as avoid becoming dependant.I followed his advice carefully and I am very very thankful that I have been saved from the misery of panic attack!

Have taken it over about 3 years.  3mg was too much.  Also noticed the effects hunge greatly on if you have a full stomach or empty.  Empty stomach, say in the morning, 1mg will do fine for panic, whereas on a full stomach or close to, 2mg's is needed.  Works great though and in only about 25-35 min.

If your doctor prescribes this medication for Restless Leg Syndrome, don't use it. You can purchase Vitamin B Complex and it will resolve the symptoms naturally. I was on clonazepam for 10 years before I discovered Vitamin B Complex, and I am so addicted to it, that it takes a very long time to wean yourself off. You must do it crumb by crumb, and week by week. Otherwise you will experience horrific side effects of withdrawal from the medication. I've also tried Requip for RLS, but had extremely vivid dreams and quit immediately.
Try Vitamin B Complex first, and see if it doesn't work for you for RLS.  The clonazepam is extremely addictive and almost impossible to get off of, certainly impossible to quit cold-turkey. "
2020$Condition: Other$2/10/2008 8:05:30 PM$Reviewer: bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$Klonopin is the best all-around benzo on the market; however, it is highly addictive.  It works great for many symptoms, especially panic/anxiety; however, your body slowly develops a tolerance for the drug, meaning that you will ultimately have to take more and more for it to demonstrate efficacy, which could push the dosage into dangerous areas.  I believe that around 1.5mg - 2mg has addictive potential, so just be careful.  Also, if you have reached the aforementioned threshold of addictiveness, be VERY careful when trying to get off of Klonopin.  The withdrawal symptoms can be very serious - even deadly (seizures, &c.) - so do not precipitously stop taking the drug.  It is, however, the best long-acting benzo on the market.

We lost our home and a lot of family to death and murder at this time and I was in dire need of help. 

I was given Lorazepam for a few months, but it was more situational.. Seriosuly, I was so stressed it was at a point of rage in traffic, etc. By the time I needed the lorazepam to work it was too late so my Dr. then prescribed my clonazepam. The quality of life I gained from this medicine is just tremendous. I was previously prescribed Lexapro, which I also believe is a life saver for me. But the Clonazepam is what really turned life around. Together I am a strong healthy woman able to cope with everything.

My only complaint is after 3 yrs of using this medicine I recently was forced to abruptly stop the medicine due to my dr not refilling it (okaying it) after 5 days without it I had tremors so bad, I was unable to control my muscles, I was rigid and had a lot of stress on my heart and had a hard time breathing. I was moving towards convulsions right before I was able to receive my medicine. I have no history of seisure disorders.. 

I HIGHLY recommend you do NOT run out of this medicine, or abruptly stop taking it without the help of your doctor. Certainly don't let yourself run out and it take so long to get a response/refill for your medicine like my experience. Not to frighten anyone. Do listen to your Dr, do not stop it abruptly. 

Even after all of that, I maintain this medication is a life saver for me.     "

I thought it was the two pots of coffee I was drinking each day, no breakfast and no lunch for years. I primarily used for what I considered heart palpitations and to much coffee, helped a lot during stressful moments, meetings, public speaking, calming the nerves during stressful situations was the main effect. Not sure, after taking for three years, went from one, then two and then to three tablets a day 0.5mg, two first off in the morning prior to work, one on the way home, prior to meeting the family and kids.

What many doctors won't tell you is that it is excruciating to get off of.
I was weaned off the medicine this past fall and it was the worst experience of my life.  After being on the med for 10 years, my body loved it and screamed for it when it was no longer available.
I withstood feelings of suicide, a constant ""out-of-body"" sensation, lethargy, dehydration and rapid weight loss.  The withdrawal was so severe, I ended up in the hospital because of the dehydration and lack of appetite.
I'm now 45 days off the medicine and finally feeling strong for the first time in a long time.  I finally feel like I've kicked the drug and I wouldn't go back on it for any amount of money.  
This was the most difficult experience in my 51 years of life."

2083$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/8/2007 8:05:15 PM$Reviewer: ercamppeterson, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This works very well for immediate action.  Depending on how bad the panic attack I will take a whole pill, otherwise I will break it in half.  Have not found it habit forming.  I only take it when I need it.  It has been a life saver in some pretty sticky situations.
2084$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/3/2007 11:54:47 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$WORKS WELL....
2085$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/2/2007 1:50:06 PM$Reviewer: $4$2$4$I can't take this unless I'm going to sleep as it knocks me out even at a 1mg dosage. Seems a bit addictive, or at least habit forming. And, it has caused some facial hair growth.

I have even tried higher doses by my doctor, still nothing...  I cannot seem to find anything to help.  I have also found that this medication makes me mean.  I have Anxiety and Panic Attacks, along with Post Traumatic Stress.

I have one small complaint though...when I miss a dose, I have severe dizziness and find it very hard to get through the day...it makes me feel physically ill if I don't take this medicine.  I wish I knew this side effect before I started taking it...hopefully this post helps someone else ask the right questions before taking this medicine.
2092$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/23/2007 11:54:46 AM$Reviewer: Frank, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$This medication works weel for me.I take it as needed. On average 5 days per week. I am always careful to not rely too much on the drug.It is good to have something that relieves tne anxiety and following panic attacks when needed. It improves the quality of my life.Be careful where it is kept. Many know that this medication is abused by some and has street value. I wish it came in a time realease.
2093$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/23/2007 1:14:13 AM$Reviewer: Amber, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$It makes hard days approachable and panic attacks mostly subside.  Take with caution, I find it's easy to rely on.  Always get a second or third opinion if you disagree with the doseage.

2097$Condition: Other$9/18/2007 2:28:05 PM$Reviewer: collettejeanne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$I have been under a tremedous amount of stress, so my doctor gave it to me for my anxiety. My anxiety has caused my blood pressure to skyrocket. I have always had normal blood pressure. I take the medication, and it calms me down so I can handle the every day things that are making my life so hard to deal with. I do not like to take any medications as a rule, but I feel for right now, this is what I need. Either that or end up hospitalized for having something serious happen due to the blood pressure. Hopefully things will soon get back on track(I am in the mortgage business,hense the stress) 
2098$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/18/2007 2:10:37 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$This medication was given to me by my PCP, most likely based on poor judgement. It instantly threw me into a heavy depression, and worsened my condition. I was unnable to move, or get out of bed, or go to work or eat for five days. I felt hopeless, listless, and chronicly sleepy/drowsy. I even took a Provigil one of those days in an attempt to stay awake and fell asleep anyways. I quickly decided to discontinue the use of this medication. It was prescribed to me for anxiety and I highly recommend that if your PCP prescribes this to you for that reason, take it as needed as opposed to the dosing I was instructed to follow which was two 0.5 mg pills daily, in addition to 20 mg Lexapro which I am considering coming off of as well. --Not to mention, none of this helped to ease my anxiety.
