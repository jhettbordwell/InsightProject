49$Anxious$1/7/2013 11:52:44 PM$Reviewer: Pandabear, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$I have been taking this medication for about 3 weeks now, and I have been satisfied with the results.  It has cured all my problems, but I have experienced some side effects.  The first night I threw up the color of the medication.  This only happened the first night, then it got much better.  There has been off and on constipation with this medication, but it is tolerable.  This medication is the second I have been on for my disorder, and I like it much better than the first.  I am not getting any emotional side effects, but they are more physical.

81$Anxious$1/4/2011 6:30:45 PM$Reviewer: Cathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug has been a lifesaver for me.  I've been diagnosed with anxiety/depression and Imipramine has made all the difference in the world.  I no longer have sleep problems, my mood is 100% improved, I'm happy all the time and I take pleasure in life.  Thank God!
