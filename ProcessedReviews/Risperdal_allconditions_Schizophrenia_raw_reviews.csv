4$Schizophrenia$10/20/2007 6:14:15 PM$Reviewer: Hey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$2$I have 4 times the highest normal range  level of  prolactin in my blood. I have significant decrease in libido and my semen seems to not be forming I'm not sure how that effects the sperm to have something to swim in when being released. I have a climax which is significantly diminished in the pleasure aspect of the ejaculation and coitis is decreased. I have decreased motivation two to three days after my shot. The intensity of my climax does vary. I seem to have no increase in blood sugar readings. I have orthostatic hypotension 3 to 4 days after the injection of the risperdone consta.I am prescribed 50mgs once every two weeks. I have been administered this dose for one year. I started this regimen in 2004 discontinued in 2005,started again in October 2006. I find when not eating adequatley and especially missing sleep I still have symptoms with the risperidone consta. I consume moderate amounts of coffee when not eating but if I eat I don't get symptoms. I hope to use diet to control symtoms and nutritional supplements as a buffer to diet. Vitamin C helps quite a bit. I find those professionals involved in my recovery are unwilling to use the diet and the nutritional supplement approach. I hope to  be free of the traditional medication because of the side effects and adverse reactions. It is frustrating that the traditional Doctors do not recommend alternative thearpy instead of traditional medicine. Look into alternative medicine there are many other approaches besides traditional medicine. I have faith in naturopathic Doctors. Not every naturopathic Doctor is as good as some, so don't be discouraged if at first you don't have success. It matters how smart and informed the Doctor is that you are seeking.

I can usually lose weight with a regular workout routine and just about any food. However, about 3-4 after taking this medicine if I eat some food from Denny's my metabolism is screwed. Maybe I should follow a low carb diet on this medication (50 g). 
13$Schizophrenia$12/3/2016 1:08:16 AM$Reviewer: kitzen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $2$1$2$My loved one has been taking this for about three months and it made him gain a bit of weight and it made him feel like he wants to be the opposite gender now. This helped with his psychosis but this has damaged him more than did him any good. He stopped taking it but the after effects break my heart.

37$Schizophrenia$8/9/2013 11:59:20 AM$Reviewer: Squeakbox, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I am very happy with this. Before I started this, my other medication was Zyprexa, then Seroquel. I have a mild dose, it lowers my anxiety, stress, stops any hallucinations (which I forget about), and helps me feel good throughout the day. Zyprexa nearly killed me with a rare side-effect, and Seroquel ruined my health drastically causing my gall-bladder to be affected (removed). I don't recommend this for everyone, but for schizophrenia, it's a breakthrough.

67$Schizophrenia$5/16/2012 12:20:33 AM$Reviewer: alwaysamama, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $3$2$5$"My son was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and is taking 4mg (2mg in morn & 2mg at bed) He was suffering from some hallucenations, paranoia, and racing thoughts.  He also takes 2mg of atovin and 20mg propropanol to help with the side effects.  Since being on this med he is moving slowly, experiencing muscle stiffness, feeling ""flat"" (emotionless), and having nervousness/restlessness, and mood swings.  This whole experience has been difficult but with the hope that the meds would help and now seeing him so lifeless, it is not only hard but also sad to see and I am sure experience.  We are in discussion with Dr to reduce by 1/2mg or maybe even 1mg but am a little worried symptoms may resume.  Just really hoping to see my son look forward to waking up in the morning.  If anyone can offer info on their dosage, when taken, and side effect meds that have helped them, please email me at [email protected]  Thank you! "

I am on .5mg of risperidone.  Because of the change of lifestyle, there has been slight weight gain, so I'm not sure if that's attributed to risperidone.  I too have been tired, but not excessively.

Before he was on Risperdal shot,he took the pills, but he stopped in 2009, because he thought he could use another form of treatment. He was okay until Dec. of 2009. Then he went crazy with fear. He thought our city was being poisoned by the water. While at our house he was asking if we had any guns.  He was so depressed, we were fearful of what he might do. He went back to his house to get some clothes. While there, he took all of his pills trying to commit suicide. When I went to check on him. I found him with pills scattered all over the floor and said he took most of them. I called 911. He spent 3 weeks in a hospital in Spokane, WA. They realized the shot was the best course to treatment. He has been on the shot since then and doing quite well.

Im in my 30s now and my other doctor said I had minor gynecomastia and recommended a ultrasound and mammogram but because the gynecomastia wasn't cancerous insurance wouldn't cover the breast glandular tissue removal. The Canadian Government should pay for it or recommend that I stop taking all antipsychotics which I have been taking for almost 2 decades

Risperdal didn't stop them at once, but after some years, they dissapeared completly. The medication made me less intelligent, sleepy to an extrem, slow, happy (but my life was empty), fearless and i gained 15 kg and got pimples. i have slept 20 hours a day for the first month, 10 in the end. my body was numb, climbing stairs felt like climbing a mountain. having a body that needs exercise every day, i felt shit with the sudden change. before, i was one of the very good looking people, but now i got rejection after rejection, because i couldn't get the good looking boys anymore. that did not help me to feel better. before, i was a highly intelligent person, now i was slow. my power was taken. people liked me like they like cows. beeing a very ambitious person, everything was taken from me and something broke in me forever. who knew me before, thought i would make it and have a career. now, i was in a chemical straighjacket. i believe, that i could have got over the halucinations without risperdal. it is about staying in your body and dominating your space.

331$Schizophrenia$2/6/2013 8:00:12 AM$Reviewer: StigmaOfParanoia, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"[Background]

At first when I took this medication I was hospitalized for drug induced psychosis. I was extremely deluded, spoke in word salads, extremely paranoid.  My brain twisted words spoken by people into words of extremely negative and harsh words constantly criticizing me and that made me depressed, angry and violent.  I wouldn't hear voices without people talking; like if I went to a quiet place I wouldn't hear any voices.

[Effects]

When I first started this medicine I was like a zombie-still am-and it affected my cognitive ability to the point that I had to relearn certain things.  During the first week of taking the medicine I would have frequent panic attacks in which my breathing would be strange and I had difficulty swallowing my saliva.  I had never had panic attacks before taking this medication. Risperdal seemed to shift my anxiety and fear from social phobia into panic attacks.

[Conclusion]

Apart from the side-effects of being: a zombie, impaired cognitive ability, weight gain, bigger chest fat around nipples(wtf), sensitivity to temperature, inhibited my speech to the point people think I'm autistic maybe due the drug's blocking of the serotonin receptor; I would say this drug has helped me blend back into society and has given me an opportunity to go to school and pursue a career at the same time.

tips

Exercise of 30 min per day helps, living with a caring family helps, socializing with friends that don't drink, do drugs or do criminal or dangerous activities helps too. Going back to school or getting a job helps as well. Good luck."

However, after a period of 4~5 months she'd start to complain of the side effects such as weight gain, short term memory loss, high blood sugar...etc and will begin to refuse the drug.  In the past my father and I have complied with her and let her skip the doses, and shortly after she'd relapse.  She's in one of those phase now, refusing the drug again complaining that she can't even remember when my sister got married (just recently).  We had to talk to her for an hr last night to get her take it.  We know this drug carry harmful side effects, but the consequence of not taking is too grave.

Risperdal was given to me at the onset of my illness, which was drug induced.  Although many people find Risperdal to be an efficacious drug, I found it very difficult to tolerate.  Perhaps it was because I was new to the whole schizophrenia thing, but I have had much better luck on Zyprexa (which is the best anti-psychotic on the market; it just has terrible side effects) and Abilify.  Risperdal made me emotionally numb; it detached me from myself and my experiences.  Additionally, it (like most of the anti-psychotics to some degree) caused me to gain some weight.  Overall, I would consider talking to your physician (and doing your own research) before starting Risperdal.  I think that you may find more pleasant alternatives, such as Abilify.  However, tolerance of anti-psychotic drugs is a very subjective experience, so Risperdal may be right for you.  But it was certainly not right for me.

I have looked up on the internet some side effects because I haven't been feeling well lately and noticed that I am experiencing quite a few of the side effects of risperdal. I am especially disgusted with my weight gain since I was always a size 10. I am 58 years old. I work full time but I am most of the time very tired. Three years ago I had my thyroid out and gained even more weight. I thought maybe I wasn't getting the right dosage of synthroid but my doctor did extensive blood work and could not find anything medically wrong with me. I am pretty sure that I am suffering from the side effects of the risperdal. I believe I had a brief psychotic disorder which brought on hallucinations when my husband ran off with my girlfried 15 years ago. My world had crashed and I was faced with keeping my house and had trouble keeping a job. So I was constantly faced with the possibility of losing my house under constant stress. My life is much better now. I am engaged and my 2 brothers live with me to help me financially with the house. I am wondering if I need this risperdal now. The side effects seem worse to me now.
