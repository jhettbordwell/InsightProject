43$Bipolar Depression$3/15/2014 10:45:48 PM$Reviewer: lana, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$i am 43 and have taken Prozac off and on since age 19. the last time I stopped taking it for who knows what reason, it was then I realized how badly I need it and will never stop taking it again! stops my angry outbursts at the kids and my sometimes desperate feelings of sorrow. this plus allegra for allergies is the only medicine I take.  do not smoke.  do not use alcohol.  highly recommend.  this medication does not make you gain weight and I never have had trouble sleeping on it.  only trouble I've had is thinking at times that I'm feeling so good I don't need it ha. has greatly diminished all my pms symptoms also.

77$Bipolar Depression$12/6/2012 7:24:44 AM$Reviewer: $3$2$4$i am not too happy about taking this medication cause it takes away your sex drive and my body builds a tolerance for it and it quits working and even my depression and mood swings get worse.

252$Bipolar Depression$6/4/2009 8:56:44 AM$Reviewer: topher, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$Was diagnosed with general axiety and depression disorder in 1999.  Was on Paxil, but felt like a Zombie.  Zoloft worked for a while then just stopped working in 2005.  Psych said this is common... don't know why.  Been on Fluoxetine/Prozac since 2005 and it's doing the trick.  And I'm on a super low dosage.  5 mg per day (1/2 of a 10mg tab).  W/o that 5mg, I'm so anxious my heart will be well over 90bpm and I can't concentrate on anything but that then start sweating uncontrollably.
260$Bipolar Depression$4/25/2009 7:23:38 PM$Reviewer: leopardspring04 (yahoo), 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$2$I was prescribed Fluoxetine HCL 20 mg (2 per day) about a year and a half ago. This was suggested because nothing else was working. The only change I noticed with this drug was gaining about FIFTY pounds. I am also taking other meds for anxiety, PTSD, agoraphobia, insomnia, and ADD. Everything else is under control with the exception of the Bipolar Depression. I do not recommend this or Zoloft, as they are both known to cause weight gain.

404$Bipolar Depression$1/25/2010 9:46:44 AM$Reviewer: ItryTOnotGIVEup, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$4$I'm 13 and I have been taking sarafem for a long period of time now. I have a very bad stage of depression and it hasnt worked the best for me. Some people don't take me seriously when I say that this drug hasn't worked. My doctor said that she would put me on a stronger dosage but never did. If you have extreme depression, ask your doctor for a strong dose. Mild depression will not work with the first dose that they give to you.
