21$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$8/28/2013 1:22:45 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was on the medication for about 2 weeks when I started experiencing really bad side effects.  I became extremely dizzy and couldn't stop sweating.  My heart raced and I would fall asleep sometime for an entire day. It felt like I was coming down with the flu. I went to the doctor and had a number of test done and they finally determined it was the side effect of the medicine.  I had to stop taking it and am really questioning continuing any medication.  This has been very scary for me.

Did not take med for few days and became depressed in matter or days.  Began taking again, and now out of depressive state once again.  Only problem, taking without prescription, get from friend that does not take correct dose and gives it to me.  How do I tell my dr. I'm taking it without prescription and let him know how well it works if I'm not supposed to be taking in the first place?  Other med taking is Wellbuterine.

The psych decided to give me Geodon to boost Pristiq to help my depression as I am not getting complete relief with Pristiq.
I took Geodon for a total of 4 days.  I was off from work all week because of Geodon.  The first 2 days I took 20mg and felt as if my equilibrium was off & I was off-balance.  Also, for someone who goes to bed by 9:00pm every night, I was up until 1:00am all 4 nights, and even with 6 hrs of sleep, I felt fine the next day.  Everything about what I did and felt was out of character for me.  By the time I hit day 4, I was in the emergency room.  My blood pressure increased to 188/110, I had chest pain, and experienced a day-long panic attack.  It's been 2 weeks since I stopped taking Geodon and I still am experiencing chest pain.  My psych had me stop Geodon and now wants me to take Abilify.  He says that after Geodon, the chest pain I feel is a symptom of a manic episode.  Funny... I NEVER experienced a manic episode in my entire LIFE and it wasn't until I took Geodon that I did. 
I need to go see a regular MD to make sure there isn't any permanent cardiovascular damage, as I still feel awful.  This drug is dangerous in my opinion.  If your doctor prescribes this for you, be sure you are monitored VERY carefully.  This is not a drug you mess with at all."

As a result of it I am suffering from Tardive Dyskinesia which I have now had for two years with no cure. If there is another medication that will help you, I would try it and don't stay on Geodon for too long.
82$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/9/2009 11:22:03 PM$Reviewer: Alexandra, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$Suffering from depression (which started from postpartum) for over 17 years, with many, many meds that did not work, one summer about 5 years ago, my therapist (not psychiatrist) suggested adding Geodon to my antidepressant. The therapist was thinking I had shades of being bipolar and this drug was starting to be used as a mood stabilizer. I thought it was a miracle. I felt like my real self again, happy, laughing and was even able to take my young daughter on a week-end trip. (The only time I've been well enough to take her anywhere.) I had no side effects, it was easy to take, but it stopped working after 3 months. I was crushed and back in the abyss again. In the last two years I have finally been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. While it didn't work very long for me, I had one happy summer and I believe it could be very effective for others.

She was hoping it would help my flatness. I felt somewhat better, but my speech became very strange/difficult to understand. My face made movements I didn't try to make, around my mouth. When I went off almost exactly a year ago with my psychiatrists' agreement I lost an entire week. I know only what others have told me - seems I split my time in sleep or the restroom (different issue, I think, realized later what that issue was, and that it was probably confusing me a lot). Not sure if I ate much of anything, but apparently I managed to call in for anything I was supposed to do that week, and that my coworkers thought there was something odd about what I said when I called in on my work shift - I didn't find out what. The first day I could remember I was very confused, and my mother happened to call. I asked why it was so dark out in the afternoon, having trouble realizing it was ~8pm when I thought it was ~3pm. My dad came and picked me up to stay with my parents a few days until I wasn't all confused. They said I could hardly get my mouth to cooperate to eat anything. I was still having a lot of difficulty trying to speak, but that wore away some - I'm better, more understandable than then, but still have difficulty speaking and being understood. I have very poor prospects of finding a job like this.

Satisfaction? You decide. Weight gain for sure, now at 190lbs being a female,  increased dry mouth with starchy (carb) food cravings, absolutely what sex drive I had left has deminished; if I don't catch the sedation effect within 15 mins after taking I am up all night.

223$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$5/11/2013 9:23:46 AM$Reviewer: ellensmithee$1$1$1$After staying with the same American, medication-fixated doctor for over a decade, I changed to a European, diet-focused doctor who, upon learning what Rxs my first doctor had me on, immediately took me off them. I had not been on Geodon long, and he said that’s a lucky thing. He said if I’d have stayed on Geodon a decade, I would “be a slobbering zombie”. If that shocks you, it did me, as well. Do NOT take this poison. Eat organic because pesticides and GMO foods are making you sick. This is your wake-up call.
227$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/16/2013 1:48:47 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$While inpatient at a psych hospital for severe depression/suicidal ideation, a doctor added a low dose of Geodon (taken in the evening) to the anti-depressants I was already on (Effexor and Wellbutrin). The first couple of nights, I was extremely tired the next morning and unable to get out of  bed the until close to lunch time. By the third day, sleeping was no longer an issue, and I felt a bit jittery. The fourth day, I felt like my heart was beating fast, and after lunch, I had a full blown panic attack - racing heart, uncontrolled sobbing, hyperventilating, sweating, muscles clenched - I have never in my life experienced a panic attack, so I can only conclude the Geodon caused it. I quit taking it, and in a couple of days, was feeling calm again. I know everyone reacts to medication differently, and it seems to help some people, but I always thought most side effects were mild - nausea, insomnia, constipation, etc. - I didn't know it could make me feel like I was going to die! It was not an experience I would wish on anyone. This is a very powerful drug and should be taken with extreme caution.
238$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$1/7/2013 9:56:45 AM$Reviewer: Cholula8, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$This pill is THE DEVIL and unless you have or have had extreme bouts with psychosis and/or Schizophrenia and are institutionalised, I would strongly urge you NEVER to put this pill in your mouth.  After being on 20mg this pill for four days to help with depression and anxiety (I have never been diagnosed with Bipolar, but we were trying to discover if thats what I had), this pill induced psychosis, put me in the hospital, and gave me the movement disorders; dyskinesia, akathisia, and Dystonia. I have had to quit work, postpone school, been on disability, and have had to work with a neurologist for the past eight months to undue the damge this pill has done to me--some of which may be permanent. I know everyone experineces medicine differntly, but this pill has not been around long enough and does not have the research to back up it's claims.  If you have had problems tolerating other medications, PLEASE DO NOT take this pill. I may be in the minority when it comes to getting tons of side effects off of every pill, and I may be that one in a million for whom this pill did not work. If you could see what I have had to endure this past year, however, I think you would agree that this pill is best left for only the most severe cases. Taking this pill has been the only regret I have in life and I want to make sure no one needlessly takes this pill ever again. I wish you happy mental health and good luck if you take this pill, you're going to need it.

The TD affected my social life by making me very self-conscious.I am a retired 64 year old woman whose friends know nothing about my disease and I want it to stay that way. This drug only did bad things for me. I wish I has never taken it. I am taking BCAA because it is said that it helps decrease TD. That is working for me.

I had many problems with extra movements, mouth sores from the dryness, and some swallowing difficulties. My problem is now post-Geodon: I can not sleep longer than 1-3 hours at a time. I do not sleep during the day! I am wondering if this is due my course with Geodon.

I was taken off Geodon 2 years ago. When I was taking Geodon I would sleep for 10 hours, and was very sleepy soon after taking the medication, and had to be able to go to bed.
After being taken off Geodon, I immediately could not stay asleep. I would wake all night long. Now, 2 years later, I am still having these problems.  I wake every 1-3 hours all night long. I can not get back to sleep most of the time and get up frequently for an hour or so. My psychiatrist is still treating me for depression with Lexapro, but I would do anything to be able to sleep all night.  I am 61 years old.

This, combined with a doctor who refused to believe the drug was causing it, provided me with a very unpleasant period.

I believe the muscle problems are more common than the company claims... but can't back that up with real statistics.

Shortly after that there was a tragic death in the family but this drug kept me feeling happy and positive. After a while the effects started to diminish so the doctor would keep raising the dosage.

This brings up the only problem I have with this drug; if you miss a dose you’re going to notice. If I forget to take it I will not be able to fall asleep at all, and if I still haven’t taken it after 12 hours of when I usually do I will get really sick.

486$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$12/12/2009 10:37:46 PM$Reviewer: Catherine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$I was put on this while in the hospital and by the second day of being on it I could barely urinate. The nurses had to start doing bladder scans before and after I went to the bathroom, well at least tried anyways. I was a few cc's of fluid short of having to be catheterized thankfully. By the third day the doctor thankfully took me off of it. Yeah it was only three days, but these three days seemed like forever with the pain of the pressure I was having from not being able to urinate.
514$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$9/30/2009 6:17:16 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$3$2$"My 18 year old daughter was prescribed Geodon 20mg twice a day to go along with her Lexapro 20mg. After a month of not feeling better, her psych increased the dose to 40mg twice a day. After a few weeks, she is sleeping all day if she takes the morning dose and can' sleep at night if she forgets to take the evening dose. If she doesn't take it all day, she experiences ""withdrawal"" like symptoms. Headache, anxiety thru the roof, etc. Gradually, she has become nauseated, experiences dizziness, feels like her muscles are 'clenchy' and twitch, has restless leg syndrome, gets red splotches on her face and feels as though she cannot relax. Because it was gradual for her, we didn't realize that the symptoms could be from the Geodon. But the more I read, the more I think that they are from the drug. She has a med/eval with her psych tomorrow and I hope to get her off of this. Even though she feels like it's the best MENTALLY so far that we've tried with her Lexapro, the side effects are incompacitating her and she cannot function on a daily basis. This simply is unacceptable and I will try to find her something else."
522$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$8/26/2009 2:22:52 PM$Reviewer: Suzanne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $1$1$3$My 20 year old son was taking this medication for 2 weeks to help him with his mood swings and depression. After 2 weeks of taking Geodon he started hearing voices telling him to kill family members, and was seeing bloody images on the walls. He came to me to let me know something was very wrong as he was hearing the voices. He had been becoming very upset and hostile after the first week, and not able to sleep. He ended up hurting his brother and having a panic attack. The doctors at the ER said to not let him take it anymore. His med doctor called the next day and asked us to increase it double which I refused. I would NOT reccamend Geodone to anyone unless they are under complete supervision and care of a professional for that first 1 month time frame. This is a very scary drug.

First couple of days didn't feel any benefit, but on the third I had nearly complete relief. (Major depressive disorder/anxiety) 

I can't remember feeling this 'normal' since I was in college back when the earth was still flat.

I'm praying that it continues to help, and that it helps you all too."

He is also on Celexa and this was added to his treatment program. They started him out on the 20 mg/day program. He was doing OK at that level. Almost immediately after they increased him to 40 mg/day he arrived in hell! He was constantly nauseous and vomiting. He constantly complained about feeling dizzy and ""just not himself"". He met w/ his psych today and told her he's not messing around with any more meds other than his Celexa. His sugar levels are all screwed up and he is nervous and shaky and can't even relax to sleep at night. I can't wait until this is out of his system. I'd rather deal with him being on-edge than have him throwing up all day!"

Well, it helped me sleep. A lot. If I didn't get at least nine hours of sleep a night, I was drowsy (almost unsafe-to-drive drowsy) for the whole next day. If I missed a dose, I couldn't sleep at all until I took it again. I had to stop taking it when my insurance ran out and I couldn't sleep for several days. Definitely not worth the price to me.

From the very first day I took it I felt dopey and giggly and strange- it scared me because I felt sort of ""out of it"" but the worst part was my legs at night- felt like restless leg syndrome that I've seen on tv!!  I've never had this before and it was horrible! I was kicking in my bed all night.  Also, I was becoming increasingly nervous because I couldn't stand the TOO HAPPY and dopey feeling.  I have 3 kids to manage and I have to be able to function.  I stopped taking this drug after only three days but I still felt the strange effects in my system for two more days.  I wish I could just find a regular anti-depressant that works.  No more anti-psychotics for me! "

My mood is very up, I have TONS of energy, I pay NO attention to negative thoughts.  All of this is great but, as a nurse, I am a bit worried about TD and wondering if any of this jittery/hyperness is TD, early.

I have been told to increase to 40 mg in 2 weeks and I can't even imagine how I would feel if I did that.  Any thoughts anyone?
