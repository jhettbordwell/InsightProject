I am taking this specifically for sleeping hey what's happened trouble getting to sleep at night until I started on this drug. I found that I was also depressed from the loss of my husband therefore this was the reason I was having problems sleeping

36$Depression$6/19/2016 2:17:02 AM$Reviewer: pistvet, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$My VA therapist gave me this. Started at 7.5, then 15mg. Then my next visit I was shocked to hear that I was to start taking 30mg. I TOLD her that that was too much, that the 15mg dose was affecting me strongly already, why 30mg? Started having muscle pain around my ribs so bad I couldn't sleep. Got so logy I walked in front of traffic. Put on 20lbs(2 weeks after quitting, down 10, so far very easy to do). This lasted about a month(you can't get a VA therapist appt. less than 6 weeks away). I stayed up long enough one night that the drug's effects lessened to the degree that I realized what was happening and reduced the dosage myself to 15mg. Wouldn't have been so bad if I would've been taken off the Trazodone first, but I wasn't. The 2 drugs together overloaded my liver apparently, thus magnifying the effects. 
37$Depression$6/9/2016 2:30:11 PM$Reviewer: Lisa, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$2$I started taking this at 7.5mg for a month and then was upped to 15mg for the second month. It took me 2 weeks for my body to adjust to this. The first 2 weeks I slept a lot and found it hard to function. I had a slightly increased appetite and have gained 15-20 pounds since I first started on this. I used to have serious bouts of insomnia but not since I started taking this. At first all I did was sleep and then I felt more regulated and I slept more normal but not great. I did feel tired a lot during the day through the whole 2 months I was on this but I am not going to be taking it anymore because of weight gain. I also felt dizzy in the first 2 weeks and for the whole 2 months at bedtime one of my legs would feel tingly and would involuntarily move like restless leg syndrome. I would have stopped taking this immediately but my doctor made me continue with it and now 20 pounds later I will try something else.

Dosage doubled at that time and sleep returned with dreams.  10 weeks on still sleeping, dreaming longer and sleeping 7-9hrs nightly.  Eating improved (ocular melanoma/1 year out)and weight gain is OK. Feeling SOOOO much better since deep sleep returned. Works with sertraline daytimes.  Overall pain greatly reduced.

49$Depression$9/16/2015 11:49:45 PM$Reviewer: jswell, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Aside from weight gain, I have been on Mirtazapine 30 mg for years, along with other meds. I eat like a bird, and I cannot lose weight.  No panic attacks. I also take Klonopin at night, so I sleep very well. I would not take this if I were working. I think the combination of my meds contribute to my weight gain. I get protein, but don't eat more than 1 full meal a day.

52$Depression$7/17/2015 11:45:28 PM$Reviewer: pdiddle78, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$This medication combined with Cymbalta finally pulled me out of a terrible depression I had been suffering for almost 6 months.  The worst side effect was Weight Gain.  I literally gained 40lbs and NOTHING I did (diet, exercise) would drop the weight.  Fortunately, I've been able to come off of it and should enjoy shedding the weight over time.
53$Depression$6/17/2015 1:48:38 PM$Reviewer: Lawro, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$Originally started taking 15mg before ned for insomnia but was then made homeless which caused me to go into deep depression with bad anxiety so upped to 30mg then 45mg. This med helped keep me together. Highly effective at treating depression with big improvements within 3 days. Moderately effective at keeping anxiety at bay. After 6 months it still improves my sleep onset, duration and quality. No side effects noticed apart from extreme drowsiness first few days.

However, the weight gain and increased appetite was awful.  I know it depends on what you eat but I found I was craving sugar and junk food.  Prior to taking Mirtazpine I had no cravings.  I'm off of now.  Will the weight come off easily?
58$Depression$12/17/2014 8:41:11 PM$Reviewer: JB, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$5$"I started on Mirtazapine oral, over a year ago. At first I found it to be too sedating and almost stopped taking it. I am now on 30mg but very depressed and short tempered. I have never had problems with panic attacks, now they happen without warning. If anyone has had the same experience please let me know. I am considering to stop taking this useless medication because Its done nothing for me. My Dr. added Prestiq which I stopped as i was turning inot a hermit not bathing or shaving or even clean the house. The withdrawel symptoms were like small shock waves in my brain for at least a month. Now, was put on Abilify and cannot wait to stop taking it. I feel useless I have no energy and fell depressed. I want to mention one more thing about Mirtazaphine oral, yes, it can lead to weight gain. I have gained 40 lbs since I've been on this drug.

60$Depression$10/29/2014 8:24:11 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$2$First night I took it I fell asleep fast. When I woke up the next day, 12 hours later, I was in a very irritated mood. That continued all day along with extreme appetite increase. Almost completed first week. Vivid dreams, some good, most bad, I remember the dreams long after waking up, which is something I haven't done in my life prior to this. No change in depression symtoms. I have gained 10lbs, almost can't get a full feeling after eating. I'm afraid to go to sleep because of vividness and content of dreams. My mood is so irritated and short with people I don't like being around anyone including friends. This is the first time I have taken anything for depression. I have one more week til I see my doctor. I will be hoping to switch to another drug.

65$Depression$6/30/2014 4:48:56 AM$Reviewer: Olayoil, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$"Oh my! I have to be honest and say I only took this drug for a few days.  I stopped right away after I found myself not being able to sleep very well, waking from sleep or a nap with my heart pounding against my chest; being extremely short of breath. It gave me panic attacks, which only exacerbated my shortness of breath and heartbeat. I had read a great deal of the reviews on here, and thought Yay, I'm going to finally get some sleep.  Not so at all. I was terribly disappointed, and being short of breath with my heart pounding prevented me from going anywhere.  It was a chore to walk in my apartment without getting winded.  Forget going out to the store or pharmacy. 

While I don't think I am in the majority, this situation happens to me quite a bit. If a drug makes others sleep, it keeps me awake. I plan on asking my psychiatrist to put me back on Nortriptyline during the day, and Trazadone at night.  I'm disappointed, but cannot wait 1 - 4 weeks for this drug to take effect."

It was very good at treating my depression.  I didn't have any of the weight gain some people complain about, but it did make me crazy tired when I was working my way up to my therapeutic dose.  
Coming off of it has been a challenge.  Nausea, and some recurrence of my panic disorder.  My doctor had me do it really slowly; over several months- I can't imagine how crazy hard it would have been if I had done it faster.  "

Frequent urination causes sleep interruption at least 5-6x nitely, then it takes awhile before I can fall back to sleep. Diarrhea is frequent in the morning. Since taking these, I get out of breath just walking 4-5 steps; my bones have been aching, ESP during  the nite, and to the point of restless tossing and turning. I feel extremely weak, thinking I'm going to lose coordination. Climbing upstairs has become a burden.  Since on these meds (one month), I have no energy doing the simplest of tasks. Prior to this, I had lots of energy, almost to the point of being unstoppable.

106$Depression$4/28/2013 3:46:12 PM$Reviewer: Matt, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$5$I've been taking the 30mg tablets for maybe 8 months now and they do what they're supposed to. I found it took a week or two to start getting used to them. They help with sleep maybe too much. They force me to sleep about 8 hours even through a couple alarm clocks going off by my head for a couple hours. I've stopped taking them before because of this and was fine for a couple days but found the littlest thing would set me off so I started taking a half a night for a couple nights and back to the full 30mg. I've been off them again now for about a week and the first couple days weren't bad but I'm finding now that the daily thoughts of suicide are coming back so I think tonight I'll start taking them again. I strongly recommend not trying to take yourself off of these pills without your docs approval. He said it usually takes 9 months to cure depression but I think it may take a bit longer so be patient. Try getting to bed at least 8 hours before you're supposed to be up. They take maybe about a half hour to an hour to start working but make sure you don't have to do anything after you've taken them because they knock me right out cold. I've found that they do increase your appetite and you may gain a few pounds but chances are you'll lose it pretty fast after your treatment. Just being off of them for a week I've found that I'm not as hungry and probably have lost 2 or 3 pounds but losing the few pounds isn't worth taking the chance of worsening your depression. Hope this helps but please for the sake of yourself and the people in your life, don't stop taking them until your doctor thinks you're ready to.

When I started taking Mirtazapine  I did not  feel any  change  even though I still  occassionally smoke pot and drink alcohol.

My first pill of 7 mg put me in zombie-like state for about 48hrs. Never take the full dose the first time, I'd suggest nibbling a corner and on a weekend when you can recover if its too strong. I couldn't drive or do even light work. 7 months later I'm now up to 30mg at bedtime and haven't slept like this in years! I take it at 8pm to fall asleep by 10 at the latest. Deep, undistrubed sleep and no grogginess next day. Sadly though, I'm begining to taper as I've gained about 40 pounds even though I've always been thin my entire life. I dream of food on this drug & keep eating even when I'm full! It did nothing for my depression so when addition of Wellbutrin did nothing I've finally found relief with 175mg of Effexor XR. I'm hoping now that the Effexor will cure my depression and the sleep issues I struggled with for so many years. Good luck to everyone out there. This is a trial and error process.

139$Depression$2/5/2012 7:55:48 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$1$I was prescribed this medication to help my insomnia caused by severe depression. After being released from the hospital I weighed 123 pounds which was low for me. I was unable to sleep and many sleeping medicines were ineffective. They would put me to sleep, but I couldn't stay asleep. My doctor  switched me to mirtazapine, thinking that it would help. While it has made me sleep the side effects have been miserable. The medicine puts you into such a deep sleep that your dreams are insanely vivid. I can't wake myself up from them, and I wake up most days so upset from the dreams. One day in particular I had my pillow in a headlock and was repeatedly punching it, all while in a deep sleep. It is a frustrating medication to be on. Not to mention I am a very healthy person, I eat mainly fruits, veggies and lean proteins. I also work out 3-5 times a week. I am now up to 135 pounds which is high for me. It is also very frustrating as I put a lot of effort into eating right and exercising. It is also not helpful for my depression. The continual weight gain is very aggravating and certainly does not help with self-esteem and depression issues. I requested at my last appointment being switched to something else, but my doctor told me that it can't make you gain weight, only increase your appetite. I think however, that the next time I go I will be insistent that we switch.

Sleep good, but the dreams are so disturbing that you think of them for days after having them and you also feel trapped while dreaming unable to wake up. Could tolerate the foggy head, but the bizarre dreams were too disturbing, they were awful and stayed with you after you were awake, just thinking how crazy the dream was. Went to Prozac, worked for me like a charm. No side effects at all and it seems to work very well for my  anxiety. Stay away from the other stuff, it's evil.

Side effects of severe headache and intense hunger disappeared on Day 7. However, at my first refill the pharmacy used a different manufacturer, TEVA. 11 days later I have stopped taking this drug altogether. My symptoms were consistent with my normal reactions to wheat and dairy. Called TEVA and they say it does not contain gluten, but it does contain lactose, which is derived from milk. HOWEVER, they do not use a gluten-free facility so cross-contamination could very easily occur. I do NOT have Celiacs disease, but I am gluten intolerant although I can consume gluten on occasion in small quantities. I had a severe gluten type reaction which included bloating (I went from slim and trim to looking 7 months pregnant in 5 days, with no weight gain; flu-like symptoms, chills and shivering (temps outside were 100 degrees, 80 inside), always felt like I had overeaten even when I had eaten nothing; sinuses stuffed up like I had a head cold, dry scratchy throat; general feeling of malaise. 56 hours after my last dose I am finally starting to feel ""normal"" again.

I'm not sure if my reaction was manufacturer-based, or if it was a build-up in my system of mirtazapine. I was taking 15mg once a day."

Pysch doctor downed my dose of Venlafaxine to 150mg and  put me on 15mg of Mirtazapine. This was to lessen weight gain and improve sex drive. Didnt do either for me and had to quit taking the drug because it was causing a sleep problem for me. My wife said that it was causing me to quit breathing like a sleep apenea problem and I would wake up feeling extremely tired. Also caused me to snore loudly, more than normal.

Since taking Mirtazapine for 2 weeks now, while I have gained back about 5 lbs., but am no longer angry, depressed, or have suicidal thoughts.

Medicine caused extreme vivid dreams and nightmares. I would wake up sleep walking and swatting at things in the air or talking in my sleep loud enough to wake myself up. Also extremely hyper sensitive to sounds, light and felt like I had sensory overload all the time. immediatly got off after I found myself sleep walking to the other side of my house only to wake up because I bumped into a chair. This medicine made me fell like a different person in a negative sense. Hard to wake up, did not get any rest when sleeping and started hallucinating.

I was up-ed from 30mg to 45 mg and Im starting to get major mood swings, and crying spells, so I am slowly tapering off to 15mg (Ive never been on anything less then 30mg), to see if I get the same therapy effect without these side effects (weight gain, spacey, mood swings, etc..) I am not Bi-Polar, I am OCPD/GAD/OCD/Panic Disorder. As Im tapering off I seem to be getting better, even my anxiety has gone down. Im off Lamictal (horrible side effects and withdrawals.) So hopefully the 15 mg is the right thing for me. The doc says I have to be on a depression pill (I dont know why.) And of all the other pills Ive tried, Ive liked this one the best, so hopefully it will all work out.

Currently I take welbutrin 450/day for depression, concerta 36/day for adhd, luvox 150/day for ocd and trazidone 150/day for anxiety and sleep. Remiron was to replace the luvox and trazidone hoping to re-instate sex drive. Now using Remiron 15/day for 2 weeks. I usualy don't remember dreams. Some med adjustments caused interesting vivid dreams but these are nasty and i wake very uncomfortable. On the positive side, I felt too buzzed at first so the other meds slowly became reduced. Now taking welbutrin 150/day, concerta 18/day. I feel great!!! (Jury is still out on sex issues but i see improvment)  Maybe after 20 years i have the correct med. I'm hoping (with doc) to eliminate all but the remiron. Only God knows for shure so I'll keep the faith!!!  Good luck all and Don't Give Up!!

When I first started on them I was sick, stomach upset, and yelling angry but stuck with it and that has gone away (I was also on Clonazpine which may have caused some of that). The only side effects I have now are weight gain (which Im learning to control), no energy (but seemes to be getting better), and get irritated easily. Im also on Lorazepam to help sleep, for RLS, and also panic attacks. Im also bi-polar so Im starting to take Lacimtal. I hope this works, because Im sick of trying diff meds. My husband says hes glad to have me back, Im smiling and laughing more now then I have in a long time, and there are times when Im almost 100% again. However, I seem to be loosing the connection lately. Im going to stick with it though, because this is the best thats worked so far. It doesnt help that my job is by far the most stressed work environment Ive ever had to be in.

When they proposed this drug, I told my docs I feel like a guinea pig and was up for being a lab rat for another test to fail.  They told me this was the last choice anyway so I had nothing to lose.  Turns out I would have had everything to lose because Remeron has been a wonder drug for me.  8 years later, I'm still smiling and upbeat.  Loving every bit of this!  It even helped me quit smoking too!  And here's a little secret most docs don't know much about...often ADD can be masked within depression because they are so well coupled together.  Taking a med like Add-eral along with this this med has been the perfect combo for me! SO AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I WANT to get up in the mornings because there's stuff I WANT to do.  And the Adderal gives me the focus and energy to get it done.  It also helped me bring my weight down to the perfect size.

Cons: Lethargic throughout day, hard to get up in the AM, dry mouth, massively increased appetite, decrease in energy level. Probly too early to see how this affects my depression but right now I'm not happy feeling like a zombie all day and being hungry all the time. Will see the Dr. in a week.

I take it along with another antidepressant. I have constant anxiety from morning to night.  The first night i took it slept 16 hours.I felt very spacey and lethargic. I felt almost more deprssed but now am starting to feel great! My appetite has not changed, but when i do eat, i feel as though i can't stop-it's like having the munchies. I've gained a lot of weight. It has worked incredibly for my anxiety. I am much calmer and laid back.

I was flitting between extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts before, so great improvement. Side effects for me: No weight gain as yet but I'm being very cautious. No real change in appetite but I do crave sugar more than usual. The main problem is my skin and eyes - extremely dry and also I have more spots/pimples than usual. I can only put this down to the medication as normally my skin is quite good. But....i would rather be happy and a bit spotty than depressed..................!!!

I must say it doesn't affect my sex drive. I'm now on 60 MG. I've managed not to gain any weight so far because I'm on a constant vigil despite the mad increase in appetite. I stay hungry. I don't know how much longer I can go on without weight gain. I feel that inevitably I will succumb to a significant increase in weight. It's like having the munchies when I was self medicating. Itâ€™s a bummer because it works well for me for depression and against anxiety. I got off my previous depression medication because of the lack of sex drive. Now thereâ€™s no affect on sex drive but who wants the extra 25 to 30 lbs. Itâ€™s like someone mentioned in a previous review a trial and error (hit and miss) type proposition.

It was to treat depression associated w/ addiction. It causes me to sleep well about 30 mins after taking, w/ extremely lucid dreams. I have experienced constant thirst no matter how much I drink. Sometimes my heart feels like it will jump from my chest, not beating fast, just very hard. It has also caused my sex drive to drop significantly. If I miss my dose, it makes me feel like I am going crazy (for real), and I start to get very bad headaches until I take my dose. I am trying to taper off by lowering my dose to 15ms about 3 weeks ago. Will drop to 7.5mg this weekend.

Treating GAD and Depression, It does allow me to pretty much sleep thru the night. I do have vivid dreams. Have found that a glass of wine or two at night increase the dreams and morning grogginess. So I wouldn't recommend that.  I've been on it for 2 months, thinking about going without and see what happens.  I am taking it in conjunction with Effexor XL.  Note: My Dr. said increasing my dosage will not increase in grogginess.  So if your taking it as a sleep aid, try the lowest dose (1/2 of a 15mg). I know that sounds weird but I have found that sometimes increasing your dosage, like say Effexor, sometimes decreases your side effects. Hummm go figure.  Good Luck to All.

I have been on this medication for two days. The first day I took the prescribed dose of 15 mg and I slept 12 hours, but it was a fitful sleep. I awoke six or seven times and had crazy dreams. When I awoke I felt drugged...I mean really drowsy. That drowsiness made me feel MORE depressed. Last night I cut the pill in half and I still tossed and turned in my sleep. I also noticed yesterday that my legs felt like moving. I've been reading the reviews and I found one that described symptoms of RLS. That's what I have been feeling. I've been on Wellbutrin for three years and I used to take it with Prozac. I just hated the sexual side effects. But I have never experienced anything like this drug and I don't like it. My practitioner and therapist says to give at least a week to 10 days. I don't think I can. I don't feel right.

It worked good - too good.  I had trouble waking up in the morning and often slept through my alarm.  I started taking it earlier in the evening (around 7:00pm).  This worked great. Slept soundly.  Then I noticed I was gaining weight quickly. I gained 25 pounds in 3 months.  My appetite increased - I especially craved sweets.  I told my doctor that the weight gain made me even more depressed and I felt terrible.  My clothes wer too tight, nothing fit me anymore. I stopped taking it and right away, I could not sleep.  I was lucky if I got 3 hours of sleep a night.  I started to lose weight though - lost about 4 pounds but then had trouble sleeping.  My doctor put me on 7.5 milligrams per night.  I gained the 4 pounds back immediately.  I stopped taking it.  My doctor put me on Seroquel.  I'm going to try it but if it makes me eat more or gain weight, I will stop taking it.

I take it for PTSD, Anxiety and Depression.  It has really seemed to help a great deal.  I have experienced a strange side effect though. I've developed either PAD or RLS.  My doctor and I are working to find out if it's specifically the medication or whether it's merely exacerbating an already existent condition.  Also tried to take it in the morning to balance out the drowsiness and it has helped a great deal.  I take my dose have a cup or two of coffee and I'm good to go.  Have a strange feeling of tension on occasion as well, much like if my whole body were tense in anticipation of a blow or some sort of action or reaction.

Taken in addendum to Citalopram Hydorbromide(Celexa).  Total effects have not been noted thus far.  Taken for three months now.  Increased appetite, loss of any sexual ambition, outstanding sedation leading to some rather sound sleeping.  Also Prescribed Ropinirole for RLS and Tremor that was caused by either the Celexa or the Mirtrazapine.  Weight gain of about 5 pounds.  Curbing the hunger issues was much easier with fruit/vegetable juice combination and hydrating well.  I believe that this has done well to assist where Effexor could not.

I slept great, but soon to realize it was too good to be true. I had crazy dreams. I never seemed to be able to get out of the bed the next day and thats not an option when you have a one year old. And i would be extreemly moody in the morning if i didnt get like 12 hours of sleep. I've been on the medication for over 8 months and gained about 60 pounds and i am a very good dieter whos never ever been so heavy. exercising had become increasingly difficult being so drouzy and and lacking my natural energy. I deffinatley feel that there are health problems due to the weight gain and i am very unhappy with the overall drug. I stuck it out and gave it a try but i started to taper myself off of it and in 2 weeks i lost 10 pounds i have my energy back and i can enjoy getting up in the morning with my son. I smile alot more now that i am not so drouzy and so does my son and husband. I will just find another medication if i need to.

He said he remembered part of it the next morning and the thought that he would hurt me if he could have gooten his hands on me.  Thank goodness for his weakened condition and the fact that we sleep in seperate beds.  This was to repace Prozac and help increase his appetite.  WE will be calling the DR. in the morning and will not take this again no matter how much weight he needs to gain.  It is not worth the risk.

But since the side affects, also directly affect me, I feel qualified to critique the med.  When the dr. put him on this drug, he completely lost interest in me.  Sexually and otherwise, and reduced our relationship to nothing more than a friendship.  How do I know it's the meds?  Because before Remeron, we had what others would call a ""normal"" sex life.  He's been on this med since late 2005.  Since that time, we've had sexual relations 3 times.  Yes, his depression and anxiety got better, but look at the cost.  Because of this, I see divorce in our future.  I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone, unless they're single and practicing abstinence."

335$Depression$7/7/2008 1:54:42 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have an undiagnosed stomach problem that left me unable to eat for months. Due to that, I became depressed and suicidal. The doctor suggested remeron at 45mg. It knocked me out ten minutes after I took it, but the next day, I was able to eat and I haven't had that stomach issue much since then. The only fly in the ointment is that the pill makes me ravenous now. I've gained like 50lbs since December (I was put on it in March of '07) and the doctor wants me to stop taking it. The bad thing there is that when I stop taking it, my mood goes downhill and my stomach starts acting up again. So it's either be fat and sane or skinny and suicidal. I think I'll keep my sanity. Thanks.

The downside: weight gain. I do not eat more than before I started, and yet I gained weight all year. I'd recommend frequent exercise or reducing your regular calorie intake if you want to avoid gaining weight, even then not sure it's possible. "

I was hungry literally all the time! I am a skinny to muscular guy who tried this drug for about 6 months and I gained over 30 pounds! The only thing that worked is it helped me sleep due to the weight gain. I normally don't eat very much or have an appetite, but I would go out for breakfast and eat a full pancake breakfast followed by more sweet items and I would still be hungry. I felt like a pregnant woman with cravings for constant food. Stay away from this drug! There are too many better alternatives out there.

422$Depression$1/19/2014 8:49:37 AM$Reviewer: Jayne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$Everyone's body chemistry is different. For me, this drug was a nightmare. I had researched medications to combat anxiety-based insomnia and thought this was going to be the solution -- one pill to counter depression/anxiety and insomnia. This wasn't the case for me. When I took the lowest dosage (15mg) I experienced heart flutters and severe dizziness (think being on top of a roller coaster or how you feel with a panic/anxiety attack), at odd intervals -- every 30 minutes or so, it would last a minute, then stop, then repeat in another 30 or so minutes. It also knocked me out. Remeron is incredibly effective for sleep, in fact I was still stoned the next day nearly 16 hours later. And that was at the lowest dosage. I honestly don't know how people function on this drug, I couldn't. Bad experience for me. But again, everyone's body chemistry is different, so what didn't work for me, may work for you. After my experiences with this drug, I got off of it immediately and went to my doctor who prescribed another drug (pristiq for anxiety/depression and oxazepam for insomnia -- both working exceptionally well for me).

It turned me into a zombie by interfering w/my gross motor skills, I tripped on carpets, steps, etc. I also gained weight and had no affect. For me it was poison, and after 3 months I insisted on going back to Zoloft, the only one that has worked for me, although I can't sleep well
when I am taking it. To counteract this I was given Ambien Controlled Release and a low dosage of Klonopin/Clonazepan to take before going to sleep. This combination has worked for me, but it took several years to find the right meds and dosage. I am now my ""normal"" self.

Mirtazapine is a differant type, and it has worked great for me.  I was having insomnia and very little appetite, and was getting extremely thin.  My sleep has returned to a normal 8 hrs. and my appetite is normal.  I was having panic attacks, which stopped the first night I started taking this medication.  I was also having much anxiety,  which I took Xanax for.  The dr. Prescribed Clonazepam as a supplement to replace the xanax.  I stopped needing the Xanax immediately, and take .5mg of Clonazepam as needed to supplement the Mirtazapine.  I am very happy I kept trying until I found something that was right for my body chemistry, as the SSRI's were not.  The clonazepam can be taken long term if needed without getting dependent on it.  Hope this helps someone out there.  Don't give up!

This time I have severe insomnia vs the first where I slept all the time. Due to my success with Effexor the first time, I felt it necessary to stay with the same class of drugs. Due to the insomnia, I switched to remeron. This medicine has been extremely beneficial in eliminating the insomnia and preventing the lack of concentration. My mood is better. Overall, I am reporting improvement from this medicine. I agree that it increases your appetite but all medicines increasing levels of serotonin do. If you stick to a strict diet regimen, the weight gain will not be as pronouned.

So I would say if you don't wanna gain weight or if extra weight gain will make other health problems worst for you, Then I would stay away from this Drug!!!!!!!

The anxiety seems to cause the depression in my case. I have been on the meds for about a year now, I gained weight (which i needed) and I've been pretty happy. I have been able to travel overseas and I took a very large course load in college this past Spring! I haven't worked since I've been on this particular pill, but I am working with my therapist to get to where i feel confident again. I highly recommend this to people who are underweight, it increases your appetite to a normal appetite level, so you are actually able to put on (and keep on) weight if needed!!

Thankfully the drowsiness tends to disappear after a while.

I am now at 45 mg, and it only seems to give a good antidepressant response when combined with prozac (fluoxetine). Neither agent alone works very well, but together they form a potent antidepressant that works for me.

Now, 5 months later, I'm still trying to lose the excess weight. I took it knowing of this possible side effect, but I thought that I might be able to control the weight gain, but I was not prepared for the incredibly voracious appetite that the drug created. I thought about food constantly, and I could not feel when I was full until my stomach actually hurt from overeating. I probably would have gained 100 lbs. had I continued taking the drug. I would never take this medication again unless I planned to commit suicide and no other antidepressants existed.

After having 5 grandparents die in 4 years, this was finally diagnosed.  Started with 15 mg and moved to 7.5 mg after a 1 1/2 years due to ""hangover"" symptom.  Have been on it for about 5 years now and just now reading reviews.  Weight gain has been the problem for me, after blowing my knee out from cycling.  But, now it is just the motivation factor that I need to work on in the future.  You have to be conscious of the foods you are buying and what you are eating.  I know this from experience and know what needs to be done to render it.  The sleep that I have gotten has been GREAT! After not sleeping for more than 3-4 hours a night for 4 years, I average about 8 hours a night, setting two alarms to get up by in morning.  Also, 5-hour energy shots have been a life-saver without adding calories. Now that I know others are having problems with the weight gain, I can focus more on my eating habits..."

I had taken Zoloft for quite a few years and it helped with depression but did nothing for the anxiety.  I had to white knuckle the anxiety and use xanax for panic attacks.  Last year, Zoloft quit helping with my depression and I was suffering.  I tried a few alternate anti-depressants with no success.  However, ffter taking Remeron for 2 days, I was back to my old self and able to sleep.  The most amazing aspect is that I have had no anxiety or panic attacks at all.  I've had anxiety for so long that I had forgotten how peaceful I could feel.  I love Remeron but it does make me sleepy during the day.  My MD, is going to up my dose to 45mg from 30 mg. to see if that will help with the sleepiness.  I haven't had any weight gain or food cravings.

I've been taking this med for a little over 5 months, everything seemed to be going well until recently. My dosage started at 15mg and then increased to 30mg after a couple of months. Since the increased dosage to 30mg, I have been having some balance problems, and now blood tests have shown that my blood counts are low and I have a iron deficiency. Dr. lowered med from 30mg to 15mg and told to eat more foods that have iron. This med keeps your mouth extremely dry and you need to carry water with you where ever you go. I have noticed that my feet and hands have swelled and I've gained 25lbs. Dr. said she would probably have to change my meds. I am also taking 2 - 20mg generic form of Paxil per day also. Prior to the mirtazapine, I was taking Paxil CR 75mg per day. I really hoped that this med would be beneficial to me, which it has been. But now it seems like it has made different medical issues arise.

I have strugled with ptsd, anxiety and bipolor. I have tried prozac, zoloft, welbutrin, lexipro, and they all made me either sick or spaced out. When i got put on remeron i had just lost my father and hadn't slept in 6 months, i couldnt eat , didn't talk to anyone. I was close to a mental break down. I weighed 99 pounds. Since tak50 ing the medice I have gained 50 lbs (which is great) I can sleep, wake up refreshed, don't feel like I have a hang over like I did with all the other meds.

Have never fell asleep as fast and slept so sound in YEARS. Depression or Negative thoughts have lessened to the point to where I dont dwell on the negative and notice increased POSITIVE thoughts and energy. Increased appetite is a factor, but exercise will power for the first month or so and your weight gain will be minimal, if any. I actually am at a lower wieght because I feel better and am more active now. Can't speak for all... but its been a life saver ""litterally"" for me."

So now I've started 15 mg. of Mirtzapine.  The first night I took a whole pill and slept all night and all the next day--it was awful.  But my doc had warned me and said to take half, if that happened.  The half pill works, but after about a week (today) I'm going to try taking a whole one again.  I'm an artist and a writer and haven't done any creative work in a year...the only thing Welbutrin didn't cure...but this week I've been painting AND writing, so I'm excited about this combo.  I just hope it doesn't wear off.  No bad dreams.

It really helped me a lot. The best part is it makes you happy and sleepy, so u just take it when you are ready for bed in the next half hour or so.It also has antihistamine properties, so I no longer take allergy pills. Very little in the way of side effects.  A little bit of nightmares in the beginning or  when adjusting to a higher dose. Before Remeron I tried different SSRI's and SNRI'S but they killed my sex drive and made me super constipated. I started at 15 mg slowly went up to 30mg after a while. Truly a wonder drug for me. Don't give up on antidepressants until you've tried Remeron!

I must admit it worked well at the beginning and I gained a well needed 20 pounds which I have lost along with my appetite after it ""pooped-out"" two and half years ago. My psychiatrist wants to add another anti-depressant but I refuse and he will not hear of it. Tried Cipralex 10 mg and it made me feel awful: burning sensation in digestive tract,sore belly,nausea,no appetite. I stopped after one pill. I feel  angry,frustrated,inadequate,I hate myself and I hate to get up in the morning to face another day of misery. My anxiety level is at a record high and I feel that my life is not worth living. When you feel better,are you not supposed to stop taking those mind -altering drugs? I am beginning to think that psychiatrists are only drug pushers. I want out and be my old happy self again before I got depressed!!!I cannot make important decisions and I am totally overwhelmed by any little problem. More drugs will not benefit,of that I am convinced! Psychiatry is not a science. On top of that,I have developed a stage 3 chronic kidney disease and have to check my creatinine level every 3 months and I blame Remeron for that! Thanks Remeron but no more!!!!!!"

He is in the treatment facility right now and this is the med they are giving him.  I can NOT believe the difference in his personality, interaction, and conversation skills.  He actually has EMOTION on his face now (before his face was just blank), he is interacting WELL w/ everyone in the facility (before he would have just stayed in his room), and he is actually having LONG CONVERSATIONS (before he would sit in a corner and rebuke anyone who attempted to engage him in coversation).  They have him on a low dose, but it seems to be working.  The doctor is talking about increasing his dosage just to see how he does, but I'm going to tell him to tell the doc that he is HAPPY with the current dose.  He is not having ANY side effects at all.  We were on our way to divorce before he sought this help.....this medication may just give me the man I always thought I'd married.

Within half an hour of taking it I would develop an insatiable appetite. After pigging out like crazy I would fall asleep and have the most lucid, vivid dreams. I would still feel like I was in them hours after waking up. I also remember being very agitated and paranoid. I spent most of my days in bed and I felt so much better once I was off this garbage.

I switched from trazodone to Remeron permanently in 2006 since Remeron also could control my sleep issues (I had excessive REM) and gastroesphageal reflux as well.  I'm really surprised at the high rate of people getting vivid dreams from this drugs.

However, getting the ""munchies"" seems to make sense to me... as it improved my GERD, it sent my appetite through the roof (causing weight gain) until I identified the fact that the weight gain was coming from the med and that I could reverse it w/(a very high degree of!) willpower."

668$Depression$9/8/2009 1:07:56 PM$Reviewer: Pixie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"Remeron was probably the worst drug I took during my three year depression. I was hung over all day, and sometimes almost fell asleep during my long expressway commute. At work I was flat, no anxiety, but no affect, almost like a zombie. When I told my psychiatrist he increased the dosage, telling me the side effects of flatness and weight-gain would go away. Although this sounded counter-intuitive, I was so desperate that I agreed. After 8 weeks on it, I began to notice another problem: it interfered with my gross motor skills. I kept stumbling and falling down. That was the end of Remeron for me. I asked my doctor to put me back on Zoloft, which had made me feel like myself, but had the side effect of insomnia. He put me on Ambien Controlled Release and Klonopin (Clonazepan) for sleep. This has worked very well and I am still taking them, including 50 mg. of Zoloft. I did stop taking Zoloft for a while, but my anxiety and depression came back slightly---though never as dreadful as when I felt suicidal---and I am coping w/my life. I am an older student getting a second post-grad degree, and I was able to do all the paper-work to get into a top-notch school.
This is in high contrast to lying in bed unable to sleep or take care of anything in my daily life. Oh, I did have to resign from my teaching job after coping w/depression for a year on numerous drugs, which didn't work. "

While I was very sleepy from this drug, I could not sleep because of my back ache which would eventually go away and I would fall asleep.  The first three days I was sleepy all the time and hungry most of the time for the first three weeks.  I did not experience nightmares, but dreams that weren't nice, sometimes waking up feeling depressed, but after getting up it would go away.  Lots of thoughts would race across my mind causing me to feel all sorts of ways after a week and a half, but after the third week, I was mostly normal.  I'm my second month and I think this drug is helping me work things out in my head, realizing that everyone is not going to like me or agree with me. Even those I love might not like me, that's life, that's the way it is and I can accept this where as before I just wanted to kill myself.

It's older, but it worked better for me than the newer SSRI's everyone raved about. They were terrible for me. The only odd thing about Remeron was that it made me very sleepy in lower doses, but not in larger doses. Took it in conjunction with Wellbutrin, which was okay too, but probably should have just stuck with the Remeron. Can't even remember why I went off it. Doctor's recommendation... 
The worst part of beginning or ending anything was weaning myself off the previous one, waiting a week or so, then titrating up on the new one until at a therapeutic dose...and suffering in the meantime. Docs are only available by voicemail. Sucks."

It made me a total zombie. I could barely complete sentences the first 2 weeks. It made me very tired and I could NOT STOP eating! Higher doses supposedly give you less side effects, so I went up to 30mg. One night I forgot to take my meds so I took them at 5 am. When I got up at 8am, I fainted in my bathroom. It was really scary!!!! Also, I have gained 10-15 pounds over the last few months. However, after the first few weeks the sleepiness and fogginess subsided.

Yes, I feel better, but I also take Celexa. Also my anxiety has lessened, so there's less to be depressed about. I am going off of Remeron nowâ€”mostly because I can't stand the weight gain.

The combination of Remeron and Lyrica proved to be dangerous for me - I passed out and fell into a chair, while trying to get back to bed after going to the bathroom one night about 2 weeks into taking both medication. I lay where I fell for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Turned out I had broke all the little bones in the upper part of my cheek on the left side. So my Dr changed my medication for depression to Elavil. I will be talking to my Dr to change me back to the Remeron, as I can not take Lyrica of Cymbalta for my Firbo. - I am one of the 15% who gets increased paing on these meds. I much prefer the Remeron, as it also helps several other symptems of Fibro. ie; IBS,anxiety, Also Elavil caused me to crave sweets and carbhydrates and I have gained 15# and my LDL Cholestrol and Triglycerides have risen a lot. I never had these problems on Remeron. and see from reading other articles on this site, Remeron helps with these conditions also. I also slept MUCH better on Remeron!

I take it in addition to Vistaril, and though the effects are very sedating, I think it's a plus in cases of severe depression. I could only see this being used for less severe/mild depression in very low doses, since it knocks down your energy level. Even after eight hours of sleep, I would still be drowsy throughout the day. I have been on Remeron for over a year, and since then (and with the Vistaril) my condition has improved. After time, the drowsiness begins to wear off and it was about that time that I was prescribed the Vistaril in addition. Has not affected my appetite or weight, and was also used in addtion to therapy (psychiatrist). 
Again, I've been on many different types of antidepressants and have only seen positive results with this drug, though it varies with different people. I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety disorder. Started treatment at fourteen years old, went on Remeron at sixteen and am currently 17 and have begun tapering off medications. Not 100% better, but have reached position where I am able to move on."
754$Depression$7/28/2008 3:59:14 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$I am taking this medication for depression, to help me sleep, and to get my appitite back.  It makes me restless when I first go to sleep but when I get to sleep I am out.  I think it is a really good drug.  I have been on it for about a week now.  I can already tell a difference in my appitite, which is good I guess cause my family gets onto me about how skinny I am all the time.  But overall I think it is currently doing its job.
755$Depression$7/16/2008 10:29:21 AM$Reviewer:  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$3$It finally allowed me to get some sleep - fifteen minutes after I took it, I would be dead out for at least twelve hours.  If I woke up any earlier, I'd still be dizzy and disoriented.  Its effects on the depression symptoms were hardly noticeable, if at all.  Besides knocking me out cold for half the day, the only other thing it did was give me an insatiable sweet tooth (and a constant craving for oreos of all things).

I cant tell if the drug is working or not, but trying to stay awake to do my normal routine is difficult.  all i want to do is sleep, and I could easily do so.

My doctor increased the dosage because she said that it is more sedating at lower dosages.  It helped a lot with my depression at first, but I am finding it less effective now that I have been on it for about 1 1/2 years.  I also have had a lot of weight gain and am having a hard time getting it off.

I still feel depressed but mine may be partly due to circumstances.  I sleep like a baby however I dream and have night sweats.  I also wake up groggy and feel that way most of the day.  Also, I have an insatiable appetite and I'm gaining weight.  So, I guess there is no perfect solution to depression and still deal with it daily and need more encouragement.

766$Depression$4/5/2008 10:52:21 PM$Reviewer: Saved by Remeron, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$To all of you who are thinking of stopping the medication because of weight gain, feeling like a zombie, those terrible nightmares, lack of sex drive, etc... I too have had all of these side effects. Before starting treatment on Remeron coupled with Lexapro (after trying every other drug on the market and suffering for 5+ years) I truly was ready to die. I had no will to live, I was angry at everything! I truly/sadly was Suicidal and Homocidal.  I would fall asleep within 5-15 minutes of taking it (the reason you take it before bed) no matter what I was doing, EATING, talking, painting my nails. I would also get this feeling of bugs crawling up and down my legs, which was discerning and extremely uncomfortable. And, I too had that INSAITIABLE APPETITE, 30lbs in the first 5months of treatment. That passed. ALL the side effects passed. My appetite is healthier now, but I'm not eating 5 candybars at once now, followed by a couple more! No terrible nightmares, no creepy crawly feelings, no more zombie girl, and I haven't gained any additional weight since the initial 30lbs. I have returned to earth! I have earned my bachelors degree in nursing and have been practicing for 1+ year. I've become married, bought a house, and am excited to live again! The last 4 years have been the best I'd had in a long time. The benefits have far outweighed the temporary side effects. Isn't your happiness worth it?!

HUGE HELP!  only prob is my new INSATIABLE appetite.  at first i thought it was just that my moods were improving (when you don't feel like living, eating just isn't that interesting) but it got worse (CONSTANT thoughts of foods in the fridge, cravings for anything and everything-luckily i also crave raw veggies) & my clothes felt tighter...i believe i have gained 15+ lbs in these last 3.5 weeks...ugh!  i hope the appetite settles down soon, as i don't want to have to stop this med and spiral back down mentally...but i also can't continue putting on weight...how to balance mental health with physical health (weight,etc.)??? overall, though, i am very thankful for this med.

I currently take 30mg with 150mg of Zoloft, and I feel great.  As for side effects, even when I'm full.  Some people complain about being tired the next day, but it's nothing compared to the exhaustion from not sleeping at all.  Overall, this medication is extremely effective.

It does help me with my sleeplessness and I do get into a deep hard sleep, which is good, but the next day I am so tired and spaced out.  I haven't noticed an improvement in my overall mood yet, maybe it is too soon.  I haven't had any crying spells for a couple of days but I feel like I could at any time.  I don't have any energy or desire to do anything.  My fuse is short and I get upset or angry easily.  I don't have any increased hunger yet so I guess that is good.  I hope all of these symptoms get better or I will have to stop this med. and try something else.

I always felt like I had an insatiable appetite and snacks were good enough to minimize it. However, the drowsiness began to greatly affect me during the morning even when I took it early at night.

I was very discouraged, I was afraid nothing would ever work. My psychiatrist prescribed me Mirtazapine and I was skeptical to try something new. I began to notice a difference in the first few weeks. My appetite was much greater than it had been, which was okay because I was underweight. The sedation did not occur which was surprising, but I guess everyone is different. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something to help them out, if you're willing to gain a few pounds!
28$Major Depressive Disorder$10/21/2016 4:45:49 AM$Reviewer: Tristan1996, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Been on the tablets for 2 months now at 15mg doses. I feel a lot better in myself. No more insomnia, depression or anxiety. My appetite has improved (people have been known to gain weight on this medication so make sure you keep tabs on your weight and diet!). Considering that in June I was hospitalized twice after suicide attempts and now I feel like I could rule the world is definitely saying something. I would still be in that rut if it wasn't for this medication. I would definitely recommend this to everybody. It also starts working a lot quicker than other medications. Sertraline (Zoloft) for example took 6 weeks to start working on me and included vile side effects. Mirtazapine just makes me feel quite drowsy (which is a benefit as my sleep has improved as a result of that particular side effect). You can slo get some crazy dreams on this medication. I have had so many adventures you would not believe it! So overall I can say that Mirtazapine has worked the best out of all the medication I have been on in the past and started working very quickly. I felt back to my old self in about 2-3 weeks of taking this drug. Thumbs up from me!

I finally went to a psychiatric center a few weeks ago and was immediately put on Mirtazapine- 30mg each night. So far, all this medication has done is make me constipated, teary/easily irritated, and able sleep like a rock. The doctor said this dosage would help my energy levels-- so ****ing much for that! I could easily sleep 12 hours straight on this. I also have had several of these episodes of deep anger/frustration/non-stop crying that last for hours. Not a good sign. I also have an obvious weight issue and need to lose quite a bit, and I do not want to continue taking Mirtazapine if it's just going to sabotage my efforts. Now I'm wondering WTF the doctor was thinking. Luckily my next appointment is in a couple days- you bet I'm going to complain.

Decided to take a whole pill after 4 days all of the above still a Zombie. I am done with this popping pill thing! We depressed people need to consider the SOURCE of our Depression and be honest with ourselves because popping pills ain't gone do it! I have a very high addictive personality and pills is not the way for me to go. I am LUCKY; not homeless, grown woman, educated, no kids, very discriminated against and TRAUMATIZED IN LIFE BY: WAR, MILITARY, UPBRINGING, AND CAPITALISM, add infinitum STUDENT LOANS AND RACISM! Sorry Doctors 50 years of ABUSE AND TRAUMA the only cure all is STAY TRUE TO MYSELF AND MY OWN TIME CLOCK! I DON'T WANT ANOTHER ADDICTION!  I do agree some people probably do need this pill or another pill but these things called ""antidepressants"" and ""anti anxiety"" pills are addictive. Good luck to anyone taking them! Please, do yourself a favor and have an exit strategy to stop taking these pills."

First was the effect on sleep which was awesome and for me always half of the battle. If I get decent sleep, everything else is easier to handle. And after a couple of months my anxiety has completely disappeared and my outlook has become actually optimistic which blows my mind as I did not realize one can feel this way.

111$Major Depressive Disorder$3/6/2013 1:16:07 PM$Reviewer: Spud, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$"This has been a really great drug for me.  I've taken a number of different meds for severe depression and anxiety.  After I got cancer in 2008 things got much worse.  I went about 20 years sleeping 3-4 hours a night with fainting spells from anxiety attacks.  The cancer just made that worse.  I was a mess.  I started with 15mg, and slowly worked up to 45mg which is what I needed.  The first two weeks I couldn't sleep enough.  I had a hard time staying awake.  After that I leveled out.  I've been taking it for about 2 1/2 years.

My life has changed.  Stable relationships, now marriage and a son, a few promotions at work, the fog has lifted.  The sadness has lifted.  Now I might have a bad day from time to time, but who doesn't?  I used to have bad months and months at a time.

Weight gain is a well know side effect of this medication.  I've gained 20 pounds, but leveled off at 20.  I try to watch what I eat.  My stomach doesn't rumble or anything like that, but I just crave sugar all the time.  If you can keep yourself in check you will be fine.

Taking this medication at night time is a must.  It knocks me out.  My dreams are AMAZING!  Like Hollywood blockbuster dreams.  It's probably the coolest side effect I've had in a medication (outside of tripping my balls off when they had me on Ambien 10 years ago).

For me, this is a wonder drug.  It's lifted my sadness off of me, and when I do get down, I bounce back MUCH faster that ever in my life.  If you get the dosage right you will be good to go."

371$Major Depressive Disorder$7/1/2016 8:59:04 PM$Reviewer: LS, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Have taken this drug on and off for four years so I have experience with 7.5mg dose, 15mg dose, and withdrawal. On 7.5 I was super sleepy in the morning, almost made it impossible for me to make it to work for my 6 AM shift. Also daydreamed about cookies, candy, root beer, etc. On 15, that sleepiness is totally gone. I still love my cookies (initially started Remeron to help combat an eating disorder and the anxiety that went with it) but I am not daydreaming about them as much. I wake up with tons of energy ready to tackle the day. The withdrawal from either dose is nothing. It's harder to fall asleep but would I still sleep 5  hours a night, so it's not like sleep is impossible while withdrawing. (I'm no longer suffering from depression related insomnia like I was, probably due to the other two AD's as well.) It's been so long since my last MDD episode and I take two other AD's so I can't really say how much it has helped my depression or anxiety. All I know is that I get a solid, restful, rejuvenating, 8 hours of sleep each night, and I don't feel the need to starve myself because food just sounds so good! I would recommend this drug to anyone suffering from either insomnia or an eating disorder. 
373$Major Depressive Disorder$6/6/2016 3:51:38 PM$Reviewer: Ellzeena, 65-74 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$1$5$I began this medication just after losing my daughter, my only child, to mental illness.  I split a 15MG pill in half at bedtime.  Without this drug, I would most likely have not been able to sleep at all and so it saved me from a long stay in a psychiatric hospital.  BUT.... least important, I gained five pounds in less than a year; most important, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OFF THIS DRUG.  Now, I was taking 7.5MG each night and when I stopped taking it I spent three weeks in EMOTIONAL HELL.  Internet gave me info that said there are actual clinics intended ONLY for withdrawal from this drug.  My advice: AVOID IT but, if you are taking it, be very, very careful when withdrawing from it, do it only with psychiatric support.

375$Major Depressive Disorder$5/4/2016 2:29:58 PM$Reviewer: Ned, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$The only two side effects I've had are sleepiness and increased appetite, but I only noticed these side effects in the first month or two of taking Mirtazapine. The benefits of Mirtazapine have DEFINITELY outweighed those two side effects. My depression has been under control since Oct 2011. I take Mirtazapine in combination with Cymbalta and Klonopin for depression and anxiety/panic disorder. One thing to consider is, just like with any depression/anxiety medication, you will need to taper off whenever you and your doctor feel that it's time to stop taking the drug. I've noticed that if I miss a night (always taken just before you want to go to sleep) then I will get slight withdrawal symptoms, but those go away the next night when I take my normal dosage again.

I have suffered from Major Depressive Disorder since I was deployed to the middle east in the Army. I also have General Anxiety Disorder with powerful panic attacks. I have tried to kill myself several times and almost succeeded. But God made it clear to me that it is not my time to go yet. I take 300mg of Venlafaxine Extended 24 hour Release along with Buspar to enhance its effects. I also take 15 mg of Mirtazapine along with it. The combination is infamously called ""The California Rocket Fuel"" and for me personally it truly lives up to its name. On all those 3 drugs alone my depression is only moderately treated BUT the combination of the 3 makes me feel AMAZING!!! I am incredibly HAPPY and I never have anxiety or panic attacks. ALL Antidepressants are different for each person and their unique brain chemistry. It took me years of suffering and trying ALOT of different antidepressants and tolerating their side effects before I finally found what works for me. DONT GIVE UP!!! Their is something out there that WILL work for you!!! Remember taking your own life is NEVER the answer!!! It may seem overwhelming at times but remember you will not always feel that way!!! Its temporary!!! You CAN get better!!! God Bless you all :)"

After two weeks, I was surprised to be able to go to bed, and wake up totally refreshed, and willing to get out of bed. Then I read up on the anitdepressant qualities, and was amazed. We upped my dose to 30mg/day, and the depression literally melted away after two weeks from the start. I'm flabbergasted!!!!

I've been suffering with major depression, severe panic attacks and agoraphobia for 30 years. Have tried many other antidepressants with no results. It took about a month of horrible side effects but my dr. pleaded with me to give it a try. I am so happy she did! Literally overnight my panic disappeared, I woke up happier than I've ever been in my whole life, I leave the house daily with a smile. This drug is truly a miracle! The only side effect I have now is insatiable appetite but I was grossly underweight so I'm not worried. Also this medicine does not effect sex life like all the other ones do. I can't say enough about remeron, especially for people with severe panic and depression.

It worked initially, but then after a month the side effects were awful. I was a zombie and felt completely bizarre and out of reality. I kept telling my psychiatrist that I felt very weird and uncomfortable and she just blew it off. It puts you to sleep very fast, but chemically it is similar to dipenhydramine, and it lasts a LONG time. This medication was an absolute nightmare for me. I finally found out from my PSY-D that MANY patients have lots of problems with Remeron and do not tolerate it well. It took over a month after discontinuing this drug to feel normal again.

Also have severe ibs & take lotomil 2,4x daily. Mirtazapine makes me sleep 10 to 12hrs nightly. Weight loss 20lbs,too skinny before starting it, no appetite. Still have chronic diarrhea. Have flat affect,no motivation,crying jags,feelings of hopelessness,worthlessness,suicidal ideation. Have real bad muscle and joint pain since I started taking mirtazapine. Why do I keep taking the medicine? I have taken many other medicines with intolerable side effects. I've been taking this combination for 6 months praying that things will get better. Now my psychiatrist wants to add cogentin. I don't know what to do,but I'm getting to the end of my rope. hope this helps someone. Thanks

456$Major Depressive Disorder$1/16/2013 8:30:50 AM$Reviewer: AAC41, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have now been taking Remeron for almost 2 months and after having tried multiple others, this seems to do the trick. I can't say when I have had more calmness and peace in my day. I do take 1/2 of 15mg in the morning and 1/2 in evening so combat the side effect of sleepiness. I have to say that I am a new person; amazing how severe depression can totally change the real you. In the past I have tried other meds for depression and to be quite honest, there would be days I would forget to take my meds  but with Remeron having made so much difference to me, I have a daily reminder to take it because I feel so alive. I do agree this drug (like most serotonin lifting antidepressants)does increase appetite which I hope will even out after awhile. I do contribute appetite and cravings for sweets to be a side effect, as well as the fact that I have stopped drinking alcohol completely. I think my body is craving the sugar I was getting through alcohol. But feeling better mentally, I have an exercise plan in place and will try to keep the weight gain at bay. I thank God for all he is doing for me, including put the doctor in my path who knew what I needed. Remeron has been a blessing.
459$Major Depressive Disorder$12/11/2012 2:07:33 PM$Reviewer: Taffy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$First episode of depression 1985, didn't know what it was, symptons were couldn't sleep, anxiety, weight loss etc. Afraid of everything. Prescribed Anafranil (clomipramine), hits both nor adrenaline and serotonin. wonderful response but awful sid effects worst being excessive face sweating, literally rivers running down my face. Had to discontinue. Suffered remitant bouts of depression but battled thorugh with support of family. Went back on Anafranil in 2000 due to severe attack. Lifted depression but had to stop due to side effects, I'm a Head Teacher of a school. This year my wife had an affair and this resulted in a severe depression. Had to leave home after 24 years of marriage, 3 kids. Thought the world was going to end. Went to docs, prescribed fluoxetine. On it for 4 months, did a little but not enough. Did my own research and persuaded dr to prescribe mirtazapine as it hits two transmitters same as Anafranil but with less side effects. On 15mg for one week and 30mg for the last two weeks. The effect has been amazing. For me its been a wonder drug. I hope it continues to work as for the first time for years I feel like me. The wife's affair is still going on although she denies it, I've confronted him and he has admitted it.  Life is not good but thanks to mirtazapine I think I can cope with almost anything. Back in work full time and looking to buy a house. One piece of advice, NEVER GIVE UP! I 've suffered for 30 years and hope this post helps someone. Nos Da everyone, thats Welsh for good night, and good luck from someone who knows.

The others (zoloft, celexa, paxil) make me feel psycho, horrible nausea, trouble sleeping,weight loss, no sex drive (on remeron I had the opposite effect of sex drive)....I wish I didn't have the menstration issue on the remeron cause I have it really helped me once getting passed the first week. Oh and for anyone starting remeron, start SLOW don't take the whole dose for the first 6 days go up slowly and it isn't as bad! I started off on 7 mg for 2 days then went up to 10 mg for 2 days then to 15mg so on. Hope this helps!

526$Major Depressive Disorder$6/10/2011 8:23:18 AM$Reviewer: Ruralmo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$A few weeks ago, my husband had a liver transplant, and we rushed to the hospita which is 60 miles from our house, and I forgot some of my meds, remeron being one of them. At the time I really needed them, I had no access to them. I called my dr. and he was on vacation and the dr filling in would not give me an emergency prescription. I nearly lost it...mentally! My husband was released in six days and is doing great. Better than expected, but that night, I took my remeron, and regained my sanity overnight. I slept like a baby.
527$Major Depressive Disorder$5/16/2011 8:23:07 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I had trouble initially. I had trouble focusing and thinking clearly, extremely tired, irritability, crazy dreams. i almost quit taking it because it made me fill awful at first. After 3 to 4 weeks the effects diminished and I feel good. I take this med with seroquel. Also have had leg tremors, My doc added benztropine i take it occasionally at night. I took it more often in the beginning.

546$Major Depressive Disorder$2/1/2011 12:27:07 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$5$"I've been taking this med for about a year at 15mgs up to 67.5mgs. It worked ok for depression and sleep for the first few months, now I've ""plateaued"". Worst side affect is ravenous appetite. I hear it is really hard to get off this drug. If you have just started treatment with remeron, I suggest you talk to your doctor about trying something else as soon as possible. I don't feel the side affects are worth the risk. Good luck! "

555$Major Depressive Disorder$12/8/2010 9:53:19 PM$Reviewer: littlefish, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I have been taking Remeron (the generic version Mirtazapine) for over a year now. 
Pros:  The drug works. It really does. I tried Lexapro and Pristiq with no success. Third try was Remeron and it worked!  I sleep all the way through the night. No waking up every few hours because it knocks you out.  I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to conquer my day without being depressed.
Cons:  I gained 10-15 pounds in the first few months.  Not to defend this side effect, but if you know in advance that you will gain weight, then start eating healthier and exercising. In my case, since I was no longer depressed, I had the motivation to exercise and lose it.  Between month 3 and now, I've since lost all that weight.  Another con was feeling drowsy for the first week.  You should start to feel very normal after the first few days.  Just plan to start taking on a Thursday or Friday so you that you spend your weekend being lazy. "

567$Major Depressive Disorder$10/1/2010 1:45:38 AM$Reviewer: AgoraNoMore, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"This medication was by far the ONE for me.  I'd been through nearly every anti-depressant you can name, and though a not so pleasant experience at Kaiser P - even some anti-psychotics as my Psych told me ""it's not that your psychotic, you just have some delusional thoughts..."".  I used to have terrible anxiety and depression - my ""delusional thoughts"" were my thinking that everybody in public was staring at me and knew that I was ""crazy"".  I became agoraphobic - and nothing Kaiser tried was working for me.  When I had lost everything (job, home, etc.) - I went to a low/no income health care center, where I finally got a GREAT team of doctors.  My psych put me on Remeron, first at 15mg/day and then up to 30 - that's when my I finally started gaining control back over my life.  Remeron is by far the best solution (IMHO) for Major Depressive Disorder with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It abolished the depression, decreased my anxiety to the point that my anxiety medication was finally strong enough to do its job.  I went from not being able to leave my home to getting a good job, having a much more enjoyable marriage, and loving/living my life!  If you've been through a similar experience or have the same diagnosis and can't tolerate the side effects of SSRI's - I would highly recommend giving this medication a chance.  It's so amazing what the right medicine can do for a patient who has been through all the wrong ones.  There should be more press coverage and certainly more patients on this safe and effective medication.  SSRI's - killed my sex drive.  Wellbutrin - gave me a grand mal seizure. Remeron - saved my life, and my marriage."
