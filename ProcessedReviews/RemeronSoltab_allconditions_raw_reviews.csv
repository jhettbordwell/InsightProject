Summary View1

 

CONTRAINDICATIONS
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
The concomitant use of Remeron Tablets and a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. Remeron should not be used within 14 days of initiating or discontinuing therapy with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) 
WARNINGS
Serotonin Syndrome
On rare occasions serotonin syndrome has occurred in association with treatment of Remeron tablets, particularly when given in combination with other serotonergic drugs. As serotonin syndrome may result in potentially life-threatening conditions, treatment with Remeron should be discontinued if patients develop a combination of symptoms possibly including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma, and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, Remeron should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan and oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in patients receiving other serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, lithium, tramadol, St. John’s wort, and most tricyclic antidepressants) 
PRECAUTIONS
Discontinuation Symptoms
There have been reports of adverse reactions upon the discontinuation of Remeron (mirtazapine) Tablets (particularly when abrupt), including but not limited to the following: dizziness, abnormal dreams, sensory disturbances (including paresthesia and electric shock sensations), agitation, anxiety, fatigue, confusion, headache, tremor, nausea, vomiting, and sweating, or other symptoms which may be of clinic"

Also this drug should never be described for pwople who have diabetes as it caused me,(and my daughter who was also prescribed) to crave nothing but sweets.  We both gained over 40 pounds. Nothing else food-wise was satisfactory we truly craved sweets.  I will never take this medicine again not Remeron.

11$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$3/9/2019 12:19:49 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been using this medication in combination with prazosin to treat PTSD and related symptoms. I'm also recovering from long term drug and alcohol abuse. At first my primary care physician had me on Prozac which I only took for a few days because it seemed to have a paradoxical effect making my symptoms worse. So I returned to illegal drug use for over a year before returning to my PCP. This time around I was diagnosed with PTSD as opposed to the major depressive disorder I was currently diagnosed with. With this in mind my doctor prescribed mirtazapine in conjunction with the high blood pressure medication prazosin which has been shown to reduce nightmares in PTSD patients. I had terrible nightmares and was averaging about 2-3 hours of sleep a night if I was lucky. Once one the medication combination I was able to sleep for a solid 8 hours. I take it at about 9pm. It doesn't knock me out immediately. I can stay up an watch a movie if I like but if I get the slightest bit comfortable then I'm out. The first week I still woke up groggy and the nightmares started to change to just vivid dreams. I still have some but it is much less frequent and I have more control to simply open my eyes if it gets too rough. They seem to be waning off. I'm less irritable now and my blood pressure is finally getting under control since my stress is lower which was the main cause of my blood pressure issues according to my doctor.

I was very discouraged, I was afraid nothing would ever work. My psychiatrist prescribed me Mirtazapine and I was skeptical to try something new. I began to notice a difference in the first few weeks. My appetite was much greater than it had been, which was okay because I was underweight. The sedation did not occur which was surprising, but I guess everyone is different. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something to help them out, if you're willing to gain a few pounds!

28$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$10/21/2016 4:45:49 AM$Reviewer: Tristan1996, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Been on the tablets for 2 months now at 15mg doses. I feel a lot better in myself. No more insomnia, depression or anxiety. My appetite has improved (people have been known to gain weight on this medication so make sure you keep tabs on your weight and diet!). Considering that in June I was hospitalized twice after suicide attempts and now I feel like I could rule the world is definitely saying something. I would still be in that rut if it wasn't for this medication. I would definitely recommend this to everybody. It also starts working a lot quicker than other medications. Sertraline (Zoloft) for example took 6 weeks to start working on me and included vile side effects. Mirtazapine just makes me feel quite drowsy (which is a benefit as my sleep has improved as a result of that particular side effect). You can slo get some crazy dreams on this medication. I have had so many adventures you would not believe it! So overall I can say that Mirtazapine has worked the best out of all the medication I have been on in the past and started working very quickly. I felt back to my old self in about 2-3 weeks of taking this drug. Thumbs up from me!

31$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$8/11/2016 5:00:22 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been taking this medication for 5 weeks now due to post traumatic stress which I avoided seeing a Dr about for a year - I have severe anxiety and panic attacks - the Dr prescribed me 15mg a night. The first two weeks I was asleep within half an hour of taking it and then I struggled to sleep on the third week, but now I have a normal sleeping pattern. I usually have vivid dreams but they have become more bizarre and so vivid that I genuinely feel they were real events. I still suffer with dry mouth and I noticed that I became very agitated. Unfortunately the agitation and irritable side effects are yet to wear off but in this last week they have slightly lessened. When you take this you will have to expect that some symptoms will get worse before getting better so you may have to trudge through it like I have. It isn't a drug that will feel like it causes miracles straight away but I'm 5 weeks in and starting to be able to go out my house a bit more. I still feel a sense of panic but I am starting to control it again which is what I wanted. I may have my dose increased again in a few weeks so I'm sure there will be more side effects to come.

36$Condition: Depression$6/19/2016 2:17:02 AM$Reviewer: pistvet, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$My VA therapist gave me this. Started at 7.5, then 15mg. Then my next visit I was shocked to hear that I was to start taking 30mg. I TOLD her that that was too much, that the 15mg dose was affecting me strongly already, why 30mg? Started having muscle pain around my ribs so bad I couldn't sleep. Got so logy I walked in front of traffic. Put on 20lbs(2 weeks after quitting, down 10, so far very easy to do). This lasted about a month(you can't get a VA therapist appt. less than 6 weeks away). I stayed up long enough one night that the drug's effects lessened to the degree that I realized what was happening and reduced the dosage myself to 15mg. Wouldn't have been so bad if I would've been taken off the Trazodone first, but I wasn't. The 2 drugs together overloaded my liver apparently, thus magnifying the effects.

It took me 2 weeks for my body to adjust to this. The first 2 weeks I slept a lot and found it hard to function. I had a slightly increased appetite and have gained 15-20 pounds since I first started on this. I used to have serious bouts of insomnia but not since I started taking this. At first all I did was sleep and then I felt more regulated and I slept more normal but not great. I did feel tired a lot during the day through the whole 2 months I was on this but I am not going to be taking it anymore because of weight gain. I also felt dizzy in the first 2 weeks and for the whole 2 months at bedtime one of my legs would feel tingly and would involuntarily move like restless leg syndrome. I would have stopped taking this immediately but my doctor made me continue with it and now 20 pounds later I will try something else.

I finally went to a psychiatric center a few weeks ago and was immediately put on Mirtazapine- 30mg each night. So far, all this medication has done is make me constipated, teary/easily irritated, and able sleep like a rock. The doctor said this dosage would help my energy levels-- so ****ing much for that! I could easily sleep 12 hours straight on this. I also have had several of these episodes of deep anger/frustration/non-stop crying that last for hours. Not a good sign. I also have an obvious weight issue and need to lose quite a bit, and I do not want to continue taking Mirtazapine if it's just going to sabotage my efforts. Now I'm wondering WTF the doctor was thinking. Luckily my next appointment is in a couple days- you bet I'm going to complain.

At first I found it to be too sedating and almost stopped taking it. I am now on 30mg but very depressed and short tempered. I have never had problems with panic attacks, now they happen without warning. If anyone has had the same experience please let me know. I am considering to stop taking this useless medication because Its done nothing for me. My Dr. added Prestiq which I stopped as i was turning inot a hermit not bathing or shaving or even clean the house. The withdrawel symptoms were like small shock waves in my brain for at least a month. Now, was put on Abilify and cannot wait to stop taking it. I feel useless I have no energy and fell depressed. I want to mention one more thing about Mirtazaphine oral, yes, it can lead to weight gain. I have gained 40 lbs since I've been on this drug.

I have gained 10lbs, almost can't get a full feeling after eating. I'm afraid to go to sleep because of vividness and content of dreams. My mood is so irritated and short with people I don't like being around anyone including friends. This is the first time I have taken anything for depression.

I have to be honest and say I only took this drug for a few days.  I stopped right away after I found myself not being able to sleep very well, waking from sleep or a nap with my heart pounding against my chest; being extremely short of breath. It gave me panic attacks, which only exacerbated my shortness of breath and heartbeat. I had read a great deal of the reviews on here, and thought Yay, I'm going to finally get some sleep.  Not so at all. I was terribly disappointed, and being short of breath with my heart pounding prevented me from going anywhere.  It was a chore to walk in my apartment without getting winded.  Forget going out to the store or pharmacy. 

While I don't think I am in the majority, this situation happens to me quite a bit. If a drug makes others sleep, it keeps me awake. I plan on asking my psychiatrist to put me back on Nortriptyline during the day, and Trazadone at night.  I'm disappointed, but cannot wait 1 - 4 weeks for this drug to take effect."

First was the effect on sleep which was awesome and for me always half of the battle. If I get decent sleep, everything else is easier to handle. And after a couple of months my anxiety has completely disappeared and my outlook has become actually optimistic which blows my mind as I did not realize one can feel this way.

It acts upon your h(histamine) receptors and glucose assimilation, thus the side effects such as drowsiness, weight gain, and anti-nausea properties.

This is the second time in my life that I have used it and, frankly, it is the only med that has ever worked for me.  If you are clinically depressed or experience severe anxiety issues that have led you to the point that you cannot function in life (re: insomnia, anorexia, panic, emerging agoraphobia, etc.) then this drug may very well help you.  Both times I have been severely underweight and Remeron has helped me to maintain a normal weight and rid me of constant nausea and anxiety and a specific phobia. When taken along with extra magnesium, the only side effects I've experienced are swelling of the feet and food cravings.  All of the other meds I've taken have either not worked or made me feel even more nuts than I felt originally. "
106$Condition: Depression$4/28/2013 3:46:12 PM$Reviewer: Matt, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$5$I've been taking the 30mg tablets for maybe 8 months now and they do what they're supposed to. I found it took a week or two to start getting used to them. They help with sleep maybe too much. They force me to sleep about 8 hours even through a couple alarm clocks going off by my head for a couple hours. I've stopped taking them before because of this and was fine for a couple days but found the littlest thing would set me off so I started taking a half a night for a couple nights and back to the full 30mg. I've been off them again now for about a week and the first couple days weren't bad but I'm finding now that the daily thoughts of suicide are coming back so I think tonight I'll start taking them again. I strongly recommend not trying to take yourself off of these pills without your docs approval. He said it usually takes 9 months to cure depression but I think it may take a bit longer so be patient. Try getting to bed at least 8 hours before you're supposed to be up. They take maybe about a half hour to an hour to start working but make sure you don't have to do anything after you've taken them because they knock me right out cold. I've found that they do increase your appetite and you may gain a few pounds but chances are you'll lose it pretty fast after your treatment. Just being off of them for a week I've found that I'm not as hungry and probably have lost 2 or 3 pounds but losing the few pounds isn't worth taking the chance of worsening your depression. Hope this helps but please for the sake of yourself and the people in your life, don't stop taking them until your doctor thinks you're ready to.

I've taken a number of different meds for severe depression and anxiety.  After I got cancer in 2008 things got much worse.  I went about 20 years sleeping 3-4 hours a night with fainting spells from anxiety attacks.  The cancer just made that worse.  I was a mess.  I started with 15mg, and slowly worked up to 45mg which is what I needed.  The first two weeks I couldn't sleep enough.  I had a hard time staying awake.  After that I leveled out.  I've been taking it for about 2 1/2 years.

My life has changed.  Stable relationships, now marriage and a son, a few promotions at work, the fog has lifted.  The sadness has lifted.  Now I might have a bad day from time to time, but who doesn't?  I used to have bad months and months at a time.

Weight gain is a well know side effect of this medication.  I've gained 20 pounds, but leveled off at 20.  I try to watch what I eat.  My stomach doesn't rumble or anything like that, but I just crave sugar all the time.  If you can keep yourself in check you will be fine.

Taking this medication at night time is a must.  It knocks me out.  My dreams are AMAZING!  Like Hollywood blockbuster dreams.  It's probably the coolest side effect I've had in a medication (outside of tripping my balls off when they had me on Ambien 10 years ago).

For me, this is a wonder drug.  It's lifted my sadness off of me, and when I do get down, I bounce back MUCH faster that ever in my life.  If you get the dosage right you will be good to go."

When I started taking Mirtazapine  I did not  feel any  change  even though I still  occassionally smoke pot and drink alcohol. I have  been reading your comments but I have felt none of the  symptoms which you describe.  I still get anxious, shitty moods and I still find it difficult to sleep. Sometimes in the beginning, it made me tired but now it doesn’t. I don’t know if it is working or not. I still get anxious and feel down. Most of the time I don’t feel like doing anything except laying around watching T.V.
 Just the nerves from writing this makes me shaky.  I am 51 years old.

My first pill of 7 mg put me in zombie-like state for about 48hrs. Never take the full dose the first time, I'd suggest nibbling a corner and on a weekend when you can recover if its too strong. I couldn't drive or do even light work. 7 months later I'm now up to 30mg at bedtime and haven't slept like this in years! I take it at 8pm to fall asleep by 10 at the latest. Deep, undistrubed sleep and no grogginess next day. Sadly though, I'm begining to taper as I've gained about 40 pounds even though I've always been thin my entire life. I dream of food on this drug & keep eating even when I'm full! It did nothing for my depression so when addition of Wellbutrin did nothing I've finally found relief with 175mg of Effexor XR. I'm hoping now that the Effexor will cure my depression and the sleep issues I struggled with for so many years. Good luck to everyone out there. This is a trial and error process.

I think it is useless as a sleep helper as it's 1st and foremost used to treat depression. I already take Effexor for depression (works to a pt.) but Mirtaz for sleep-forget about it!

Several years of insomnia both before and after I divorced four years ago. I wouldn't call myself depressed but an extremely busy mind and some major spikes in anxiety keeps me awake unless I'm working out in the woods. 

I also have anger issues. Well. I'm sleeping very deeply now and my concentration has gone up and anger has subsided - although I did see a therapist during this as well, so I'm not sure what's causing the subsidence in anger. Seems like it creeps back when I go on ""drug-holidays"". My weight hasn't fluctuated much. I'm a runner and frequently my work takes me into outdoor, backcountry environments so I'm always burning calories. Not sure I notice an extreme increase in what has always been an active appetite.Thee has been some. 

The dreams are pretty intense and interesting. I relish being able to dream deeply. Sometimes they get disturbing but that may be my brain crunching it's way through problems and past hurts while in hibernation mode. 

The big thing is, I'm sleeping again and it's a way more forgiving sleep drug than the ""classic"" sleep meds that are out there. Both cause longer sleep periods but I'm less groggy w/ the Mirtazapine then pretty much all the other sleeping meds I've tried. 

Lack of sleep slowly kills."

139$Condition: Depression$2/5/2012 7:55:48 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$1$I was prescribed this medication to help my insomnia caused by severe depression. After being released from the hospital I weighed 123 pounds which was low for me. I was unable to sleep and many sleeping medicines were ineffective. They would put me to sleep, but I couldn't stay asleep. My doctor  switched me to mirtazapine, thinking that it would help. While it has made me sleep the side effects have been miserable. The medicine puts you into such a deep sleep that your dreams are insanely vivid. I can't wake myself up from them, and I wake up most days so upset from the dreams. One day in particular I had my pillow in a headlock and was repeatedly punching it, all while in a deep sleep. It is a frustrating medication to be on. Not to mention I am a very healthy person, I eat mainly fruits, veggies and lean proteins. I also work out 3-5 times a week. I am now up to 135 pounds which is high for me. It is also very frustrating as I put a lot of effort into eating right and exercising. It is also not helpful for my depression. The continual weight gain is very aggravating and certainly does not help with self-esteem and depression issues. I requested at my last appointment being switched to something else, but my doctor told me that it can't make you gain weight, only increase your appetite. I think however, that the next time I go I will be insistent that we switch.

Went to Prozac, worked for me like a charm. No side effects at all and it seems to work very well for my  anxiety. Stay away from the other stuff, it's evil.

Then I had some disturbing traumatic information, and found myself only sleeping two hours each night, and a heaviness in my chest.  Couldn't concentrate or eat.  My doctor put me on this medication, and from day one has been great!  Sleep through the night, eat, no heaviness.  But after the first month of medication (purchased through Walgreens), I had my medication changed to be sent through the mail through CVS/Caremark.  THIS medication is completly different.  Can't sleep through the night, constipated, and other symptoms people talk of.  Talked to my doctor and got some more medication through Walgreens, and I'm back to sleeping through the night again.  BEWARE, just because the name of the med is the same, it may work different.  Walgreens is an oval shaped pill, and CVS is round.

Side effects of severe headache and intense hunger disappeared on Day 7. However, at my first refill the pharmacy used a different manufacturer, TEVA. 11 days later I have stopped taking this drug altogether. My symptoms were consistent with my normal reactions to wheat and dairy. Called TEVA and they say it does not contain gluten, but it does contain lactose, which is derived from milk. HOWEVER, they do not use a gluten-free facility so cross-contamination could very easily occur. I do NOT have Celiacs disease, but I am gluten intolerant although I can consume gluten on occasion in small quantities. I had a severe gluten type reaction which included bloating (I went from slim and trim to looking 7 months pregnant in 5 days, with no weight gain; flu-like symptoms, chills and shivering (temps outside were 100 degrees, 80 inside), always felt like I had overeaten even when I had eaten nothing; sinuses stuffed up like I had a head cold, dry scratchy throat; general feeling of malaise. 56 hours after my last dose I am finally starting to feel ""normal"" again.

I'm not sure if my reaction was manufacturer-based, or if it was a build-up in my system of mirtazapine. I was taking 15mg once a day."

I was having some suicidal thoughts, was quited angry and depressed. I had lost over 18 lbs from the stress, and was sleeping only 3-4 hours a night. 

Since taking Mirtazapine for 2 weeks now, while I have gained back about 5 lbs., but am no longer angry, depressed, or have suicidal thoughts. The only real negative for me is that once I take it at night, I better be prepared to sleep between 8-12 hours. If awoken after 6 hours, Im wiped out all day.

However one of the side effects not listed about Remeron/Mirtazpine is it will lower your sex drive at least in my case and give you weaker erections. I've asked my doctor if there were sexual side effects and he said no. The medication helps me sleep when i take ambian and xanax along with it. I was told it would help my anxiety throughout the day replacing the xanax but it doesn't for me. I sleep better but feel just as anxious thorough the day. My xanax is the only thing i can take as needed to keep my at a relaxed state which seems over active to most people including doctors.

I was up-ed from 30mg to 45 mg and Im starting to get major mood swings, and crying spells, so I am slowly tapering off to 15mg (Ive never been on anything less then 30mg), to see if I get the same therapy effect without these side effects (weight gain, spacey, mood swings, etc..) I am not Bi-Polar, I am OCPD/GAD/OCD/Panic Disorder. As Im tapering off I seem to be getting better, even my anxiety has gone down. Im off Lamictal (horrible side effects and withdrawals.) So hopefully the 15 mg is the right thing for me. The doc says I have to be on a depression pill (I dont know why.) And of all the other pills Ive tried, Ive liked this one the best, so hopefully it will all work out.

Currently I take welbutrin 450/day for depression, concerta 36/day for adhd, luvox 150/day for ocd and trazidone 150/day for anxiety and sleep. Remiron was to replace the luvox and trazidone hoping to re-instate sex drive. Now using Remiron 15/day for 2 weeks. I usualy don't remember dreams. Some med adjustments caused interesting vivid dreams but these are nasty and i wake very uncomfortable. On the positive side, I felt too buzzed at first so the other meds slowly became reduced. Now taking welbutrin 150/day, concerta 18/day. I feel great!!! (Jury is still out on sex issues but i see improvment)  Maybe after 20 years i have the correct med. I'm hoping (with doc) to eliminate all but the remiron. Only God knows for shure so I'll keep the faith!!!  Good luck all and Don't Give Up!!

Couldn't sleep, losing weight, anxious with panic attacks. Initially tried on a SSRI but had EXTREME increase in anxiety and panic. Tried low dose mirtazepine (7.5 mg) and it worked beautifully. Anxiety under control, no panic attacks, appetite back (OK for me - skinny).

The drug gave me only minor sedation. Here's a trick: this drug can be way too sedating for some especially at low dose. The reason is mostly due to the fact it is a strong antihistamine. So if you are considering this med try 50 mg of Benadryl. If that whacks you out probably best to avoid mirtazapine but if the Benadryl has no sedative properties for you then this might well be a good choice."

When I first started on them I was sick, stomach upset, and yelling angry but stuck with it and that has gone away (I was also on Clonazpine which may have caused some of that). The only side effects I have now are weight gain (which Im learning to control), no energy (but seemes to be getting better), and get irritated easily. Im also on Lorazepam to help sleep, for RLS, and also panic attacks. Im also bi-polar so Im starting to take Lacimtal. I hope this works, because Im sick of trying diff meds. My husband says hes glad to have me back, Im smiling and laughing more now then I have in a long time, and there are times when Im almost 100% again. However, I seem to be loosing the connection lately. Im going to stick with it though, because this is the best thats worked so far.

At first, it was fantastic. I took it about an hour before my target bedtime, got to sleep with no problem, and had the most amazing, vivid dreams. It made me feel calm during the day, relieving the symptoms of my anxiety. 

At first, the side effects were minimal. Around the third month, things started to get bad; I had uncontrollable cravings for candy every night, and it became difficult to get up in the morning without multiple alarm clocks and prescription stimulants. I never believed that a drug could cause such an intense craving...but it was as strong as a smoker's craving for a cigarette after not having one for 10 hours. The drug no longer made me go to sleep, either; I started taking it about two hours before my target bedtime, and ended up wandering around the house like a zombie for five or six hours, not able to remember what I had done the next day. 

I tried really hard to work with the drug, but the side effects began to outweigh the benefits. I tried eating less, exercising a whole lot, and replacing candy with fruit, but still managed to gain 30 pounds...25% of my initial body weight. People started asking if I was pregnant. The zombie feeling was affecting my work, and rather than taking advantage of my insomnia like I used to, I found that I couldn't go to sleep, couldn't get up in the morning, and couldn't do anything at night after taking the medication, despite being awake. 

I stopped taking the drug about a month ago, and despite being slightly more anxious, I feel better overall. I'm no longer taking daytime stimulants, and even though I still can't sleep at night, at least I have those hours back. I feel like I own my body again, and I can enjoy eating food like I used to. I gave this drug a fair shot, but to me, the side effects outweighed the benefits"

When they proposed this drug, I told my docs I feel like a guinea pig and was up for being a lab rat for another test to fail.  They told me this was the last choice anyway so I had nothing to lose.  Turns out I would have had everything to lose because Remeron has been a wonder drug for me.  8 years later, I'm still smiling and upbeat.  Loving every bit of this!  It even helped me quit smoking too!  And here's a little secret most docs don't know much about...often ADD can be masked within depression because they are so well coupled together.  Taking a med like Add-eral along with this this med has been the perfect combo for me! SO AMAZING.  For the first time in my life I WANT to get up in the mornings because there's stuff I WANT to do.  And the Adderal gives me the focus and energy to get it done.  It also helped me bring my weight down to the perfect size.

I have 30 prednisone pounds to deal with already.  One other drug I take decreases the appetitie. So we may vave a real battle on my hands!! I do feel less anxious and an loving the straight through sleep I am getting, first in a long long time. the daytime grogginess is getting better, Taking at 7 pm is ideal.
219$Condition: Depression$2/10/2010 4:24:39 PM$Reviewer: Ms Turi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$3$I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety. Also had trouble falling and staying asleep. Have only been taking this medication for a week & not sure I like it. First night I took it (half of 15 mg), it immediately knocked me out. I slept for 12 hours. The third night I had to take the full 15 mg dosage. Pros: Anxiety level seems to be lower, Sleeping through the night. Cons: Lethargic throughout day, hard to get up in the AM, dry mouth, massively increased appetite, decrease in energy level. Probly too early to see how this affects my depression but right now I'm not happy feeling like a zombie all day and being hungry all the time. Will see the Dr. in a week. Will see if I'll continue with the medication. I took Zoloft for 3 yrs prior and though I gained weight, I didn't have any of these side effects.  Will log back in another month if symptoms improves and I continue with this drug.

I've felt really drugged out and like a zombie. I don't like feeling this way at all. I also take Ambien. I think the combination of these two make me feel this way although it is too early to tell.

I'm not going to take an Ambien tonight and see how that works. It was really difficult for me this morning getting up and ready for work. Thank God I walk. 

I am thinking that if I don't start feeling better soon I will ask the Dr. to decrease to 15 mg. I'm not sure why the Dr. put me on such a high dosage to start off with.

I'm trusting in God with this medication and praying that it willa ctually work. I don't like feeling the way I am."

No real change in appetite but I do crave sugar more than usual. The main problem is my skin and eyes - extremely dry and also I have more spots/pimples than usual. I can only put this down to the medication as normally my skin is quite good. But....i would rather be happy and a bit spotty than depressed..................!!!

I must say it doesn't affect my sex drive. I'm now on 60 MG. I've managed not to gain any weight so far because I'm on a constant vigil despite the mad increase in appetite. I stay hungry. I don't know how much longer I can go on without weight gain. I feel that inevitably I will succumb to a significant increase in weight. It's like having the munchies when I was self medicating. It’s a bummer because it works well for me for depression and against anxiety. I got off my previous depression medication because of the lack of sex drive. Now there’s no affect on sex drive but who wants the extra 25 to 30 lbs. It’s like someone mentioned in a previous review a trial and error (hit and miss) type proposition.

I have experienced constant thirst no matter how much I drink. Sometimes my heart feels like it will jump from my chest, not beating fast, just very hard. It has also caused my sex drive to drop significantly. If I miss my dose, it makes me feel like I am going crazy (for real), and I start to get very bad headaches until I take my dose.

Treating GAD and Depression, It does allow me to pretty much sleep thru the night. I do have vivid dreams. Have found that a glass of wine or two at night increase the dreams and morning grogginess. So I wouldn't recommend that.  I've been on it for 2 months, thinking about going without and see what happens.  I am taking it in conjunction with Effexor XL.  Note: My Dr. said increasing my dosage will not increase in grogginess.  So if your taking it as a sleep aid, try the lowest dose (1/2 of a 15mg). I know that sounds weird but I have found that sometimes increasing your dosage, like say Effexor, sometimes decreases your side effects. Hummm go figure.  Good Luck to All.

I have RA so exersize is limited. I smoke and had cut down to 10 a day. Taking this drug has spiraled my eating habits out of contriol and increased my smoking to 20 a day. I now have severe breathing problems as a result. This drug should NOT be given as a sleeping pill and other health facts such as SEVERE weight gain should be listed.This drug is making me eat excessively and smoke excessively. I have no control over this and this in its self is now making me depressed. Insomnia was my problem not depression. Now i have the added health risks of being a heavy smoker and over weight to my list. I hold this drug solely responsible.

I have been on this medication for two days. The first day I took the prescribed dose of 15 mg and I slept 12 hours, but it was a fitful sleep. I awoke six or seven times and had crazy dreams. When I awoke I felt drugged...I mean really drowsy. That drowsiness made me feel MORE depressed. Last night I cut the pill in half and I still tossed and turned in my sleep. I also noticed yesterday that my legs felt like moving. I've been reading the reviews and I found one that described symptoms of RLS. That's what I have been feeling. I've been on Wellbutrin for three years and I used to take it with Prozac. I just hated the sexual side effects. But I have never experienced anything like this drug and I don't like it. My practitioner and therapist says to give at least a week to 10 days. I don't think I can. I don't feel right.

My muscle aches are still there. It definately puts me to sleep.

Two of my finger tips on my left hand are constantly numb. 8 hours of sleep is not worth 35 lbs. & numb, swollen, aching hands. Back to the drawing board. :(

It worked good - too good.  I had trouble waking up in the morning and often slept through my alarm.  I started taking it earlier in the evening (around 7:00pm).  This worked great. Slept soundly.  Then I noticed I was gaining weight quickly. I gained 25 pounds in 3 months.  My appetite increased - I especially craved sweets.  I told my doctor that the weight gain made me even more depressed and I felt terrible.  My clothes wer too tight, nothing fit me anymore. I stopped taking it and right away, I could not sleep.  I was lucky if I got 3 hours of sleep a night.  I started to lose weight though - lost about 4 pounds but then had trouble sleeping.  My doctor put me on 7.5 milligrams per night.  I gained the 4 pounds back immediately.  I stopped taking it.  My doctor put me on Seroquel.  I'm going to try it but if it makes me eat more or gain weight, I will stop taking it.

Somehow i never build a tolerance to it!  My body built up tolerance to Ambien Cr 12.5, Lunesta 3mg, Rozerem 8mg, Seroquel 100 mg, but Remeron (mirtazipine) has not!  The only downfall is that it is difficult to wake up, plus i take this with a 2mg Ativan and its the perfect combination for my extreme insomnia/depression.

My doctor and I are working to find out if it's specifically the medication or whether it's merely exacerbating an already existent condition.  Also tried to take it in the morning to balance out the drowsiness and it has helped a great deal.  I take my dose have a cup or two of coffee and I'm good to go.  Have a strange feeling of tension on occasion as well, much like if my whole body were tense in anticipation of a blow or some sort of action or reaction.

In one year I started a new job, my oldest went away to college, my dad had 2 brain surgeries, my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer and died, and I also lost another very close relative. I have tried many anxiety meds and had bad side effects. The only thing that worked was Lorazapam. Which I was taking 3x a day. I quit taking it last August. I was too foggy all day. I have also been taking Mirtazapine for almost 2 years. I love sleeping all night, with no dreaming. I hate going to bed at 8:30 pm, dragging out at 7am, and being foggy for half the morning. I hate no sex, swelling in hands and feet, dry mouth, gaining 45 lbs, memory issues. I was taking 15 mg and started cutting the pill in half(doctor's orders)last October. That did not help. So my doctor had me stop taking the Mirtazapine last Friday night and start taking Sertraline(Zoloft)25 mg. each morning. I did good until last night. I woke up at midnight with terrible anxiety. I haven't had that in a long time. I took 2 Lorazapam and they didn't help much. I finally fell asleep sometime in the morning. Today I have anxiety, did not go to work. I called the nurse and she thinks I should take the Sertraline at night.I'm thinking the anxiety is withdrawals. I want to go back to the Mirtazapine, to make this go away.

Taken in addendum to Citalopram Hydorbromide(Celexa).  Total effects have not been noted thus far.  Taken for three months now.  Increased appetite, loss of any sexual ambition, outstanding sedation leading to some rather sound sleeping.  Also Prescribed Ropinirole for RLS and Tremor that was caused by either the Celexa or the Mirtrazapine.  Weight gain of about 5 pounds.  Curbing the hunger issues was much easier with fruit/vegetable juice combination and hydrating well.  I believe that this has done well to assist where Effexor could not.

I had been on anti-depressants for about 4years for depression & anxiety but slowly tapered off months ago cuz I had been feeling much better & cuz I thought my problems wer side-effects from the meds. I haven't been depressed at all sense I quit taking em but I told my neurologist about everything afew months ago when I started seeing him for the tremors. After trying afew meds out & having bad reactions, he prescribed me a dose of 15m of Remeron at nite & the pharmacist gave me Mirtazapine. I've only been on it a couple weeks but I already gained bout 20pounds & my shaking isn't any better at all. I find that I get hungrier than I used to so I'm eating alot more. Another major side-effect I'm having from Mirtazapine is that I'm zoning out alot. Like rite before I started typing this post I knew exactly what I wanted to say but by the time I typed the 1st 2lines, I forgot it. I find I've been kina clumsy like bumping into or dropping things. I also notice that I have less energy & sleep more to. I'm seeing my doc again in a few days so hopefully the nite before I see him will be my last time taking this. Least this didn't make me sick to my stomach like the other meds I've been trying lately.

It was about 6AM before I finally fell asleep. So, I guess I can add one more anti depressant to the list of ""tried and didn't work"".

But since the side affects, also directly affect me, I feel qualified to critique the med.  When the dr. put him on this drug, he completely lost interest in me.  Sexually and otherwise, and reduced our relationship to nothing more than a friendship.  How do I know it's the meds?  Because before Remeron, we had what others would call a ""normal"" sex life.  He's been on this med since late 2005.  Since that time, we've had sexual relations 3 times.  Yes, his depression and anxiety got better, but look at the cost.  Because of this, I see divorce in our future.  I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone, unless they're single and practicing abstinence."

I didnt like it and my Dr. put me on Mirtazipine. Thing is I needed it upped every 6 mos to a year. I have also gained tons of weight, I know have issues with my health that could be from my weight. And just last week the effects have stopped I cannot get to sleep and when I do I don't stay asleep. I want off this drug. I was off it for 3 weeks waiting for my new insurance to kick in, and I lost 4 pounds. Nothing significant but I am 40 pounds overweight. That just tells me why I am overweight. I take wellbutrin and it helps with everything but sleep. I will be speaking to my Dr. to get off this drug.

335$Condition: Depression$7/7/2008 1:54:42 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have an undiagnosed stomach problem that left me unable to eat for months. Due to that, I became depressed and suicidal. The doctor suggested remeron at 45mg. It knocked me out ten minutes after I took it, but the next day, I was able to eat and I haven't had that stomach issue much since then. The only fly in the ointment is that the pill makes me ravenous now. I've gained like 50lbs since December (I was put on it in March of '07) and the doctor wants me to stop taking it. The bad thing there is that when I stop taking it, my mood goes downhill and my stomach starts acting up again. So it's either be fat and sane or skinny and suicidal. I think I'll keep my sanity. Thanks.

I can't function feeling as groggy as I did and have not taken anymore of this medication.  Plus, all the comments of the weight gain really concerns me.

At first the Dr told me to take 1 at night which I did. I don't remember falling asleep and slept like a log. In fact my husband had to shake me to waken me the next morning. I woke up with the driest mouth and felt like I had been run over by a bus. No energy whatsoever. So, the next night I tried half of one tablet. Almost the same effect. I just could not function the next morning. I know that it says not to break or crush the tabs but I am now taking 1/4 of a tab every night and it seems the perfect dose for me. I have a great nights sleep and wake up refreshed. My Dr thinks I am taking half each night (15mg). I'm not game to tell him that i take 1/4. I asked him for a lower dose and he said that 30mg was the lowest. Anyway, I feel fine and I am now sleeping well. I don't seem to be aggitated any more either and I most definately have not noticed any difference in my appetite. I have not gained weight. The only thing that worries me about this medication is that it says not to stop taking them abruptly. I wonder what what happen!! Sounds ominous. I don't want to be taking meds all my life and will talk to my Dr about slowly coming off them when he feels the time is right. Another point is, it is important to take them every night and not skip any doses. They will not be as effective if you do that. They are not addictive so that is one good thing. What they actually do is restore the natural chemical balance of your brain. They get a thumbs up from me."

On 7.5 I was super sleepy in the morning, almost made it impossible for me to make it to work for my 6 AM shift. Also daydreamed about cookies, candy, root beer, etc. On 15, that sleepiness is totally gone. I still love my cookies (initially started Remeron to help combat an eating disorder and the anxiety that went with it) but I am not daydreaming about them as much. I wake up with tons of energy ready to tackle the day. The withdrawal from either dose is nothing. It's harder to fall asleep but would I still sleep 5  hours a night, so it's not like sleep is impossible while withdrawing. (I'm no longer suffering from depression related insomnia like I was, probably due to the other two AD's as well.) It's been so long since my last MDD episode and I take two other AD's so I can't really say how much it has helped my depression or anxiety. All I know is that I get a solid, restful, rejuvenating, 8 hours of sleep each night, and I don't feel the need to starve myself because food just sounds so good! I would recommend this drug to anyone suffering from either insomnia or an eating disorder.

I split a 15MG pill in half at bedtime.  Without this drug, I would most likely have not been able to sleep at all and so it saved me from a long stay in a psychiatric hospital.  BUT.... least important, I gained five pounds in less than a year; most important, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OFF THIS DRUG.  Now, I was taking 7.5MG each night and when I stopped taking it I spent three weeks in EMOTIONAL HELL.  Internet gave me info that said there are actual clinics intended ONLY for withdrawal from this drug.  My advice: AVOID IT but, if you are taking it, be very, very careful when withdrawing from it, do it only with psychiatric support.

375$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$5/4/2016 2:29:58 PM$Reviewer: Ned, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$The only two side effects I've had are sleepiness and increased appetite, but I only noticed these side effects in the first month or two of taking Mirtazapine. The benefits of Mirtazapine have DEFINITELY outweighed those two side effects. My depression has been under control since Oct 2011. I take Mirtazapine in combination with Cymbalta and Klonopin for depression and anxiety/panic disorder. One thing to consider is, just like with any depression/anxiety medication, you will need to taper off whenever you and your doctor feel that it's time to stop taking the drug. I've noticed that if I miss a night (always taken just before you want to go to sleep) then I will get slight withdrawal symptoms, but those go away the next night when I take my normal dosage again.

I have suffered from Major Depressive Disorder since I was deployed to the middle east in the Army. I also have General Anxiety Disorder with powerful panic attacks. I have tried to kill myself several times and almost succeeded. But God made it clear to me that it is not my time to go yet. I take 300mg of Venlafaxine Extended 24 hour Release along with Buspar to enhance its effects. I also take 15 mg of Mirtazapine along with it. The combination is infamously called ""The California Rocket Fuel"" and for me personally it truly lives up to its name. On all those 3 drugs alone my depression is only moderately treated BUT the combination of the 3 makes me feel AMAZING!!! I am incredibly HAPPY and I never have anxiety or panic attacks. ALL Antidepressants are different for each person and their unique brain chemistry. It took me years of suffering and trying ALOT of different antidepressants and tolerating their side effects before I finally found what works for me. DONT GIVE UP!!! Their is something out there that WILL work for you!!! Remember taking your own life is NEVER the answer!!! It may seem overwhelming at times but remember you will not always feel that way!!! Its temporary!!! You CAN get better!!! God Bless you all :)"

This medication was given to me along with Trazodone and Melatonin.  It sure lets me sleep good.  In fact, I want to sleep ALL the time!  When I get up in the morning, I feel sedated and I feel that way until mid-afternoon. I have been on this medication 14 days and have gained 2 lbs so far.  If I continue to put on the weight, I will protest.  Dr will have to change my medication because gaining weight would create another depressive mood!

I was hungry literally all the time! I am a skinny to muscular guy who tried this drug for about 6 months and I gained over 30 pounds! The only thing that worked is it helped me sleep due to the weight gain. I normally don't eat very much or have an appetite, but I would go out for breakfast and eat a full pancake breakfast followed by more sweet items and I would still be hungry. I felt like a pregnant woman with cravings for constant food. Stay away from this drug! There are too many better alternatives out there.

It took about a month of horrible side effects but my dr. pleaded with me to give it a try. I am so happy she did! Literally overnight my panic disappeared, I woke up happier than I've ever been in my whole life, I leave the house daily with a smile. This drug is truly a miracle! The only side effect I have now is insatiable appetite but I was grossly underweight so I'm not worried. Also this medicine does not effect sex life like all the other ones do. I can't say enough about remeron, especially for people with severe panic and depression.

402$Condition: Other$6/6/2014 11:20:48 AM$Reviewer: Drb, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I've been on 30mg generic Mirtazipine for about 2 years after a depressive event.  I used to think that I just didn't need much sleep and would average between 4 and 6 hours of very light sleep each night.  With the onset of my depression I was getting only 2-3 hours of sleep each night.  My Dr started me on 30mg and the first night I slept for 16 hours straight.  Fortunately this was on a weekend and the next night I again slept for over 12 hours.  My depression was linked to a stressful event and I have recovered from that so I don't know what part the remeron played in my recovery but I love the change it has made in my sleep pattern.  I can depend on the 30mg to give me a sound 8 hours of sleep each night.  I set the alarm on my phone to remind me each evening at 7:30 to take the med.   About 2 hours later I am feeling sleepy and easily fall asleep without tossing and turning or my mind racing.  I especially like that if I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I can quickly go back to sleep.  When I get up at 6:00 in the morning I can still feel the effect of the med but by 7:30 the effects have completely worn off and I am clear-headed the rest of the day and never feel drowsy after lunch.  For me remeron has worked wonderfully to give me a normal sleep pattern and no side effects of weight gain.  I do exercise daily and haven't changed my eating habits since starting remeron.  Great drug in my opinion

It puts you to sleep very fast, but chemically it is similar to dipenhydramine, and it lasts a LONG time. This medication was an absolute nightmare for me. I finally found out from my PSY-D that MANY patients have lots of problems with Remeron and do not tolerate it well. It took over a month after discontinuing this drug to feel normal again.

418$Condition: Other$2/13/2014 7:34:52 PM$Reviewer: UnderControl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$After trying most SSIR's on the market, between 2000-2010, Remeron has proven to be the best and only drug I can tolerate and rely on for acceptable and sufficent relief from: 1. Depression, 2. Major Depressive Episodes, 3. PTSD and 4. Nausea associated with anxiety.  I had horrible side effects from Buspar, Wellbutrin, Xanax, Prozac & Zoloft.  I believe this drug is safe, the side effects are actually minimal, and it's an overall superior drug in this class.  It has subsided suicidal thoughts.  Slight weight gain is annoying but I wouldn't trade it less effective & more commonly prescribed drugs.  Remeron is an older (tried and true) drug, and not widely precribed anymore which I think is a shame, considering it's effectiveness.  It doesn't need a 'booster' drug and may help bring back an appetite to those who suffer from depression/anxiety related episodes.  It's off label use for PTSD has had a mild (good) effect on me but not significant enough to use for that purpose alone.  Best wishes to those wanting relief, who need & deserve relief, and try it based on this recommendation, coming from over a decade of experience with taking the small 30 mg. pill at bedtime - which also helps insomnia!

Within days, I felt an increase in my motivation and my will to get things done. I generally felt happier. The first days of taking this medication, I even felt slightly euphoric.

Before beginning this medication, I had read reviews about it and was pretty worried from what I read. However, I've experienced only a very light change in my weight. I've had little to no side effects and I am not drowsy after I wake up.

I've personally benefitted quite a bit from this med and have experienced only one awkward side effect: it has caused my breasts to often be lumpy and twice their usual size. One is also a little larger than the other but it's barely noticeable.

For me, this drug was a nightmare. I had researched medications to combat anxiety-based insomnia and thought this was going to be the solution -- one pill to counter depression/anxiety and insomnia. This wasn't the case for me. When I took the lowest dosage (15mg) I experienced heart flutters and severe dizziness (think being on top of a roller coaster or how you feel with a panic/anxiety attack), at odd intervals -- every 30 minutes or so, it would last a minute, then stop, then repeat in another 30 or so minutes. It also knocked me out. Remeron is incredibly effective for sleep, in fact I was still stoned the next day nearly 16 hours later. And that was at the lowest dosage. I honestly don't know how people function on this drug, I couldn't. Bad experience for me. But again, everyone's body chemistry is different, so what didn't work for me, may work for you. After my experiences with this drug, I got off of it immediately and went to my doctor who prescribed another drug (pristiq for anxiety/depression and oxazepam for insomnia -- both working exceptionally well for me).

I didn't realize that a drug could make food be the only thing on my mind 24/7.  So after the second week and 15 lbs. later I gave up my best sleep ever and disposed of the rest of my script.

434$Condition: Other$7/31/2013 9:16:10 PM$Reviewer: MMarie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$3$I was prescribed this drug for anxiety and sleep issues. Worked great at first,I was sleeping 8-10 hours, deep restful sleep, but overtime I realized it was making my anxiety WORSE, especially during the day. I have never felt stranger or more unstable while on this drug. I experienced mood swings, intense anxiety, panic attacks,weight gain, and the absence of my menstrual cycle. As soon as I stopped taking it, my anxiety decreased, my menstrual cycle came, and the panic attacks decreased. Would NOT recommend this drug to anyone who is sensitive to drugs in general or is looking for anxiety relief. I miss sleeping, which is the only thing it helped me do, but the side effects were NOT worth it. I did not feel depressed whatsoever before taking this drug but did while taking it. It made me weary of taking prescription medications.

I had been taking 100 mg Trazadone at bedtime, but was switched to Remeron 30 mg. Within a few hours of taking the drug, my limbs stiffened and tingled and were very painful. I became confused and agitated. For days, I was weak and jumpy. It took 4 days before I felt normal again. There are newer meds that work well with fewer side effects. I fired the doctor who prescribed this nasty drug and found one who knows what he is doing.

It turned me into a zombie by interfering w/my gross motor skills, I tripped on carpets, steps, etc. I also gained weight and had no affect. For me it was poison, and after 3 months I insisted on going back to Zoloft, the only one that has worked for me, although I can't sleep well
when I am taking it. To counteract this I was given Ambien Controlled Release and a low dosage of Klonopin/Clonazepan to take before going to sleep. This combination has worked for me, but it took several years to find the right meds and dosage. I am now my ""normal"" self. Please don't lose hope and know that there is an effective combination for you too. Good luck!"

Mirtazapine is a differant type, and it has worked great for me.  I was having insomnia and very little appetite, and was getting extremely thin.  My sleep has returned to a normal 8 hrs. and my appetite is normal.  I was having panic attacks, which stopped the first night I started taking this medication.  I was also having much anxiety,  which I took Xanax for.  The dr. Prescribed Clonazepam as a supplement to replace the xanax.  I stopped needing the Xanax immediately, and take .5mg of Clonazepam as needed to supplement the Mirtazapine.  I am very happy I kept trying until I found something that was right for my body chemistry, as the SSRI's were not.  The clonazepam can be taken long term if needed without getting dependent on it.  Hope this helps someone out there.  Don't give up!

456$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$1/16/2013 8:30:50 AM$Reviewer: AAC41, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have now been taking Remeron for almost 2 months and after having tried multiple others, this seems to do the trick. I can't say when I have had more calmness and peace in my day. I do take 1/2 of 15mg in the morning and 1/2 in evening so combat the side effect of sleepiness. I have to say that I am a new person; amazing how severe depression can totally change the real you. In the past I have tried other meds for depression and to be quite honest, there would be days I would forget to take my meds  but with Remeron having made so much difference to me, I have a daily reminder to take it because I feel so alive. I do agree this drug (like most serotonin lifting antidepressants)does increase appetite which I hope will even out after awhile. I do contribute appetite and cravings for sweets to be a side effect, as well as the fact that I have stopped drinking alcohol completely. I think my body is craving the sugar I was getting through alcohol. But feeling better mentally, I have an exercise plan in place and will try to keep the weight gain at bay. I thank God for all he is doing for me, including put the doctor in my path who knew what I needed. Remeron has been a blessing.

This time I have severe insomnia vs the first where I slept all the time. Due to my success with Effexor the first time, I felt it necessary to stay with the same class of drugs. Due to the insomnia, I switched to remeron. This medicine has been extremely beneficial in eliminating the insomnia and preventing the lack of concentration. My mood is better. Overall, I am reporting improvement from this medicine. I agree that it increases your appetite but all medicines increasing levels of serotonin do. If you stick to a strict diet regimen, the weight gain will not be as pronouned.

Prescribed Anafranil (clomipramine), hits both nor adrenaline and serotonin. wonderful response but awful sid effects worst being excessive face sweating, literally rivers running down my face. Had to discontinue. Suffered remitant bouts of depression but battled thorugh with support of family. Went back on Anafranil in 2000 due to severe attack. Lifted depression but had to stop due to side effects, I'm a Head Teacher of a school. This year my wife had an affair and this resulted in a severe depression. Had to leave home after 24 years of marriage, 3 kids. Thought the world was going to end. Went to docs, prescribed fluoxetine. On it for 4 months, did a little but not enough. Did my own research and persuaded dr to prescribe mirtazapine as it hits two transmitters same as Anafranil but with less side effects. On 15mg for one week and 30mg for the last two weeks. The effect has been amazing. For me its been a wonder drug. I hope it continues to work as for the first time for years I feel like me. The wife's affair is still going on although she denies it, I've confronted him and he has admitted it.  Life is not good but thanks to mirtazapine I think I can cope with almost anything. Back in work full time and looking to buy a house. One piece of advice, NEVER GIVE UP! I 've suffered for 30 years and hope this post helps someone. Nos Da everyone, thats Welsh for good night, and good luck from someone who knows.

The one bad side thing that i hope goes after time is the horrific nightmares OH MY GOSH those dreams are awful and i do mean awful a few times i woke up crying because the dreams were just that horrific.
I will ask my doctor if those bad dreams will go but apart from that it stops my constant worrying.
Of course i still worry about the normal things in life but i am able to sleep about 8hrs a night rather than 2hrs a night like i did before.
My doctor put me on 30mg and told me to take half for the first then told me to start taking the full 30mg after a week.
But when i took the whole 30mg the dreams got more horrific so i just take half which is 7.5mg.
It's important to be careful what you buy when getting your groceries or you will gain a lot of weight while taking these pills but overall i think they have helped me with less worrying.
Peace to you all and hope you all have a happy life :)"

This aided sleep, however it the drowsiness lasted for part of the next day, coffee helped.

Thankfully the drowsiness tends to disappear after a while.

I am now at 45 mg, and it only seems to give a good antidepressant response when combined with prozac (fluoxetine). Neither agent alone works very well, but together they form a potent antidepressant that works for me.

Now, 5 months later, I'm still trying to lose the excess weight. I took it knowing of this possible side effect, but I thought that I might be able to control the weight gain, but I was not prepared for the incredibly voracious appetite that the drug created. I thought about food constantly, and I could not feel when I was full until my stomach actually hurt from overeating. I probably would have gained 100 lbs. had I continued taking the drug. I would never take this medication again unless I planned to commit suicide and no other antidepressants existed.

Have been on it for about 5 years now and just now reading reviews.  Weight gain has been the problem for me, after blowing my knee out from cycling.  But, now it is just the motivation factor that I need to work on in the future.  You have to be conscious of the foods you are buying and what you are eating.  I know this from experience and know what needs to be done to render it.  The sleep that I have gotten has been GREAT! After not sleeping for more than 3-4 hours a night for 4 years, I average about 8 hours a night, setting two alarms to get up by in morning.  Also, 5-hour energy shots have been a life-saver without adding calories. Now that I know others are having problems with the weight gain, I can focus more on my eating habits..."

I had taken Zoloft for quite a few years and it helped with depression but did nothing for the anxiety.  I had to white knuckle the anxiety and use xanax for panic attacks.  Last year, Zoloft quit helping with my depression and I was suffering.  I tried a few alternate anti-depressants with no success.  However, ffter taking Remeron for 2 days, I was back to my old self and able to sleep.  The most amazing aspect is that I have had no anxiety or panic attacks at all.  I've had anxiety for so long that I had forgotten how peaceful I could feel.  I love Remeron but it does make me sleepy during the day.  My MD, is going to up my dose to 45mg from 30 mg. to see if that will help with the sleepiness.  I haven't had any weight gain or food cravings.

Remeron is the generic form of Mirtazapine. I was told by my old psychiatrist who is also a dr of pharmacology that GENERIC MEDICATIONS ARE NOT CHEMICALLY THE SAME AS THE BRAND NAME. An example I lived thru--I was on Prozac for many years which became generic.  I bombed out at an all time low on fluoxetine (gen.Prozac), lost my job cuz of it, went to my psychi. who said all her patients bombed on on the generic and all had to be changed to either the brand name only or an entirely different anti-depressant.  GENERICS SUK, if you can afford the brand name, I suggest you stick with them.  That's probably why remeron didn't work for me.

I was allergic to most foods and got migraines from wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, about everything that you can eat that makes life worth living, as well as the usual environmentals. Except for chocolate which is instant, Food allergies are easy to miss as triggers. You eat something with flour in it (the crouton the waitress neglected to pick out of your salad for example) and 2 days later a crippling migraine comes over the hill.  By the time I was at 30 mg I started to notice I was getting a pass or maybe only a mild episode where I had every right to expect worse. At 45 mg I realized I was experiencing the change we were looking for for 2 years of drug experimentation had arrived--in a drug the dr. had not event expected to work. 

I actually loved the dreams.  He kept asking me about depression and I would say ""no more than anyone having a migraine 2 or 3 times a week.""  But I have always liked what was in my head and even if it was scary or horrifying, I had the capacity to wake up in the morning and say ""boy am I glad that was just a dream. don't get me wrong. I have had anxiety issues for which I had to take zoloft (now citalopram, the cheaper version).
I would like to go down on the remeron, simply because I do not want to be an ""uninsurable"" with a previous condition which migraines are if they are under control with more than 3 drugs. I still have rescue meds and topomax. I still have allergies, but the food ALLERGIES  DISAPPEARED WITH REMERON. Or rather as my doctor put it, th e part of my brain that interpreted that as pain disconnected from the pain source--I guess that would apply to depression too."

I started having panic attacks and had total loss of appetite (nervous stomach). I lost about 15 lbs. in 2 mths.  My dr. prescribed Remeron, I started taking 7.5 mg (1/2 tablet) about a month ago and it was helped immeasurably. Anxiety is much improved (although at work I still get heart palpatations, etc.).  My appetite is much better, stomach feels fine and most importantly my sleep has greatly improved.  Now that I've gone through a long stretch of sleep problems I know how vital it is to having a good frame of mind, energy and a positive outlook.  I can't underestimate how important getting a good night's sleep is.   I will say the only side effect I don't like is at times I feel a little dizzy and light headed.  On a couple of occasions I skipped taking it for a day or two and I immediately noticed I didn't have the dizziness.  I highly recommend Remeron for anxiety and insomnia.  I don't have depression so can't say how well it works for it.

Before, I was prescribed a 150 mg daily dose of trazodone before going to bed to help me sleep.  I usually took 75mg to 150mg.  However, it didn't seem to work at all for sleep.  Just okay for depression.  First night of Remeron didn't help at all, either.  Took a couple of hours to feel drowsy and had light, broken sleep afterward.  Still hopeful, though.  I could take an Ambien CR 12.5 mg but I'm trying not to take them that often as they are expensive.  Time will tell.  Not sure of how it will work for my depression.

Pros:  The drug works. It really does. I tried Lexapro and Pristiq with no success. Third try was Remeron and it worked!  I sleep all the way through the night. No waking up every few hours because it knocks you out.  I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to conquer my day without being depressed.
Cons:  I gained 10-15 pounds in the first few months.  Not to defend this side effect, but if you know in advance that you will gain weight, then start eating healthier and exercising. In my case, since I was no longer depressed, I had the motivation to exercise and lose it.  Between month 3 and now, I've since lost all that weight.  Another con was feeling drowsy for the first week.  You should start to feel very normal after the first few days.  Just plan to start taking on a Thursday or Friday so you that you spend your weekend being lazy. "

I fell asleep after taking it right away. But after one week I just couldn't stay awake. I could be talking to someone and aI would pause, close my eyes and was asleep. Then my ankles and feet swelled up, This is something that never happened to me. I also got severe neck and shoulder pain with rigid stiffness. the back of my head, neck, and shoulders were very painful. I felt like I wanted to vomit constantly.. I went to my Dr. and was told to stop medication because I was havoing an allergic reaction to it. This is the 4th day and I still don't feel better, I don't have the neck pain is all.

I'd been through nearly every anti-depressant you can name, and though a not so pleasant experience at Kaiser P - even some anti-psychotics as my Psych told me ""it's not that your psychotic, you just have some delusional thoughts..."".  I used to have terrible anxiety and depression - my ""delusional thoughts"" were my thinking that everybody in public was staring at me and knew that I was ""crazy"".  I became agoraphobic - and nothing Kaiser tried was working for me.  When I had lost everything (job, home, etc.) - I went to a low/no income health care center, where I finally got a GREAT team of doctors.  My psych put me on Remeron, first at 15mg/day and then up to 30 - that's when my I finally started gaining control back over my life.  Remeron is by far the best solution (IMHO) for Major Depressive Disorder with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It abolished the depression, decreased my anxiety to the point that my anxiety medication was finally strong enough to do its job.  I went from not being able to leave my home to getting a good job, having a much more enjoyable marriage, and loving/living my life!  If you've been through a similar experience or have the same diagnosis and can't tolerate the side effects of SSRI's - I would highly recommend giving this medication a chance.  It's so amazing what the right medicine can do for a patient who has been through all the wrong ones.  There should be more press coverage and certainly more patients on this safe and effective medication.  SSRI's - killed my sex drive.  Wellbutrin - gave me a grand mal seizure. Remeron - saved my life, and my marriage."

I have gained 10LBS seems like it's all in my stomach and am having issues with water retention (4 lb difference between morning and night)but I'm not positive if the edema is the remeron or not as I also take other pills.

I've been taking this med for a little over 5 months, everything seemed to be going well until recently. My dosage started at 15mg and then increased to 30mg after a couple of months. Since the increased dosage to 30mg, I have been having some balance problems, and now blood tests have shown that my blood counts are low and I have a iron deficiency. Dr. lowered med from 30mg to 15mg and told to eat more foods that have iron. This med keeps your mouth extremely dry and you need to carry water with you where ever you go. I have noticed that my feet and hands have swelled and I've gained 25lbs. Dr. said she would probably have to change my meds. I am also taking 2 - 20mg generic form of Paxil per day also. Prior to the mirtazapine, I was taking Paxil CR 75mg per day. I really hoped that this med would be beneficial to me, which it has been. But now it seems like it has made different medical issues arise.

It was a God send, let me sleep which definitely helped with getting clear of constant depression.  After 2 months, I began having very jittery legs at night, for 2 hours, keeping me awake then, but after that, would sleep soundly again.  I found that by cutting the dosage in half the jitters stopped and I still slept okay. Also, remeron gave a bothersome weight gain on abdomen and gut which I hate, can't get rid of it.  After 6 months, I very gradually went off remeron, was off 2 weeks, but now the inability to stay sleeping has returned.  So, I guess I'll have to get back on it, which makes me sad as I don't like to be on drugs, especially something that puts on unnecessary weight.  But, sleep is extremely important, so I guess I'll just have to live with a pot belly. Another reason I wanted to stop remeron is because it made my muscles and joints feel stiff and achy.  I felt older than I am.

Before Remeron I tried different SSRI's and SNRI'S but they killed my sex drive and made me super constipated. I started at 15 mg slowly went up to 30mg after a while. Truly a wonder drug for me. Don't give up on antidepressants until you've tried Remeron!

I take the 45 mg. dose. It helps me fall asleep pretty quick but, before I fall asleep, I get muscle twitches. There have even been occations where I have kicked my wife in my sleep. I also take Vicodin ES for a disk I had replaced in my neck, Buspar, and Prozac. I'm not sure if the twitches are from either of these or the Remeron, like some have reviewed in the past. Overall, other than the twitches and kicks, I am pretty well satisfied with Remeron.

In the beginning however I did NOT like the side effects. The first night I took it I woke up feeling like  zombie. I could barely function throughout that first day and I couldnt eat enough food to fill me up. I swear I ate for hours at a time. I have always been a skinny person and I never had problems with gaining weight in the past. I have noticed now that Ive been on this drug that I have put on a few pounds. However the crazy side effects I experienced in the beginning are not really an issue for me anymore. Im glad I didnt just abrubtly stop after taking my first dose because I realy did need to let my body learn to adjust to this medication. So as of right now I can honestly say that my anxiety is a small fraction of what it used to be and Remeron does seem to be helping.

609$Condition: Other$3/19/2010 2:44:12 AM$Reviewer: none, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$1$After taking remeron a few years ago with limited effectiveness but no side effects my doc prescribed it again after trying other anti-depressants. I do suffer depression but also anorexia and PTSD type of symptoms/anxiety. I take 45mg of it along with 10mg diazepam at night. I am having horrific nightmares, waking 4 or 5 times a night and am exhausted but too afraid to sleep despite the diazepam. I asked the doctor if it could be a side effect of the drug at the last apt. and he shrugged and said 'possibly' but its not serious. When I looked it up I was shocked to see how many others have had similar reactions (some not so severe)and I have just phoned the doc to ask him why he didn't tell me and why he isn't listening to how seriously this is affecting me (just when I was starting to recover). He has suggested simply taking 15mg of DOrmicum (for insomnia) so I sleep! The whole plan for me has been to reduce medication gradually (I was taking a number of different medications) and replace them with remeron. TO simply 'throw' more meds at the problem seems so wrong. I was doing fairly well on FLuoxetine, he doesn't like giving it because he's afraid I'll lose weight but as anyone with anorexia knows it isn't appetite that will cause weight gain or loss. I have had no change in weight with increased appetite from remeron or decreased appetitie from Prozac. I have agreed to give the sleeping tablets a try for a few days to see if the nightmares stop but if not I will refuse to take this medication anymore and will have to review it anyway as I don't want to remain on sleeping tablets and have already been taking remeron for long enough for this side effect to have subsided if it was going to. It is pulling me back into worsening symptoms and suicidal thoughts. I am thankful to have a husband who is aware of what is going on and can keep watch!

It helped with generalized anxiety quite a lot, but did not help with social anxiety. I didn't notice much antidepressant effect. Even though this medication did not feel generally activating I developed agoraphobia and experienced panic attacks while taking this medication (which improved upon cessation). This may have been due to the norepinephrine effect. It helped alot with sleep, weight gain, and appetite. There were no sexual side effects and I found it easy to discontinue the medication. Overall, I was unsure how useful the medication was and suspected it may be worsened some aspects of my condition.

My psychiatrist wants to add another anti-depressant but I refuse and he will not hear of it. Tried Cipralex 10 mg and it made me feel awful: burning sensation in digestive tract,sore belly,nausea,no appetite. I stopped after one pill. I feel  angry,frustrated,inadequate,I hate myself and I hate to get up in the morning to face another day of misery. My anxiety level is at a record high and I feel that my life is not worth living. When you feel better,are you not supposed to stop taking those mind -altering drugs? I am beginning to think that psychiatrists are only drug pushers. I want out and be my old happy self again before I got depressed!!!I cannot make important decisions and I am totally overwhelmed by any little problem. More drugs will not benefit,of that I am convinced! Psychiatry is not a science. On top of that,I have developed a stage 3 chronic kidney disease and have to check my creatinine level every 3 months and I blame Remeron for that! Thanks Remeron but no more!!!!!!"

Additionally, my p-doc put me on it to help me taper from low level doses of Valium and Ambien, which I started when the cancer diagnosis was made.  The quantities of valium and ambien I'm on are very low (3mg/day and 5mg/every other day respectively), but I'm also a recovering alcoholic with 10 years sobriety and my addictive personality was giving me trouble in getting off these drugs now that the cancer-associated anxiety is somewhat less.
  Anyhow, I'm in my 4th week of treatment and I take 15 mg. Mirtazapine nightly.
It has been a significant aid to sleep and I
am now about to taper the Ambien to 2.5 mg every other night.
  The Mirtazapine has brought a general, but significant lessening of my anxiety. So far, its effects on my depression have been less, although also noticeable. I may need to ramp up to 22.5 mg or even 30, but need to discuss that with the doc first, of course.
  There has been some weight gain, perhaps 3-5 lb. so far and it takes a while to wake up in the mornings and become lucid. Maybe this will pass with some time.  
  Over the years, I've been on a number of different meds for depression and anxiety, including Zoloft, Luvox and Lexapro. As well as combined Lexapro/Buspar therapy to also address anxiety. None of them have ever done much for me. Low levels of valium (no more than 4mg/day) have been the only med that has ever helped my anxiety.  This seems to be changing and Mirtazapine may be ""the"" med that best fits and addresses my combined anxiety/depression issues.  That's good news.  I'll need to do some dose tinkering in consultation with my p-doc as the valium and ambien go away. But I'm pretty optimistic that we may finally have found the wrench that fits my bolt head...:)

This combination works great -- I get 8-9 hours of good quality sleep, and this is after almost giving up hope after trying everything on the market with poor results (Lunesta, Sonata, regular Ambien, trazodone, even chloral hydrate). I also take 300 mg. of Effexor XR each day, and my doctor said that the combination of Effexor and Remeron is known to be a potent one in fighting depression, so she raised the Remeron dosage to 30 mg. I thought the sedative effects would go away with the higher dose, but I'm still sleeping peacefully almost every single night. I'm really hoping that the higher dose will ""kick in"" and relieve me of this horrible depression that has plagued me for so long now. That would be wonderful indeed."
650$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$11/9/2009 10:44:31 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$4$I have only been taking this medication for about a week, but in the first 3 days, i did nothing but sleep; i would wake up a few times and not even remember i had been awake, almost as if i was sleep-walking; and when i wasn't sleeping i would only be awake for maybe 10 minutes at a time and the only thing I would do in those 10 minutes was eat. This medication is supposed to be helping me with my PTSD but every time i get into a deep sleep I am often awaken due to the nightmares of the flashbacks I would get. Still, even 7 days after that I am afraid to take the medication because I do not want to experience those flashbacks.I will agree that the weight gain has been tremendous; I am only 16 and already before taking this medication, i was overweight. now i am 13 pounds heavier than what I was a week ago. my experience so far with this medication has not been pleasant, and due to my age, i don't have much say in whether or not i am to take this medication or not.

I'm really surprised at the high rate of people getting vivid dreams from this drugs.

However, getting the ""munchies"" seems to make sense to me... as it improved my GERD, it sent my appetite through the roof (causing weight gain) until I identified the fact that the weight gain was coming from the med and that I could reverse it w/(a very high degree of!) willpower."

I was hung over all day, and sometimes almost fell asleep during my long expressway commute. At work I was flat, no anxiety, but no affect, almost like a zombie. When I told my psychiatrist he increased the dosage, telling me the side effects of flatness and weight-gain would go away. Although this sounded counter-intuitive, I was so desperate that I agreed. After 8 weeks on it, I began to notice another problem: it interfered with my gross motor skills. I kept stumbling and falling down. That was the end of Remeron for me. I asked my doctor to put me back on Zoloft, which had made me feel like myself, but had the side effect of insomnia. He put me on Ambien Controlled Release and Klonopin (Clonazepan) for sleep. This has worked very well and I am still taking them, including 50 mg. of Zoloft. I did stop taking Zoloft for a while, but my anxiety and depression came back slightly---though never as dreadful as when I felt suicidal---and I am coping w/my life. I am an older student getting a second post-grad degree, and I was able to do all the paper-work to get into a top-notch school.
This is in high contrast to lying in bed unable to sleep or take care of anything in my daily life. Oh, I did have to resign from my teaching job after coping w/depression for a year on numerous drugs, which didn't work. "

While I was very sleepy from this drug, I could not sleep because of my back ache which would eventually go away and I would fall asleep.  The first three days I was sleepy all the time and hungry most of the time for the first three weeks.  I did not experience nightmares, but dreams that weren't nice, sometimes waking up feeling depressed, but after getting up it would go away.  Lots of thoughts would race across my mind causing me to feel all sorts of ways after a week and a half, but after the third week, I was mostly normal.  I'm my second month and I think this drug is helping me work things out in my head, realizing that everyone is not going to like me or agree with me. Even those I love might not like me, that's life, that's the way it is and I can accept this where as before I just wanted to kill myself.

It's older, but it worked better for me than the newer SSRI's everyone raved about. They were terrible for me. The only odd thing about Remeron was that it made me very sleepy in lower doses, but not in larger doses. Took it in conjunction with Wellbutrin, which was okay too, but probably should have just stuck with the Remeron. Can't even remember why I went off it. Doctor's recommendation... 
The worst part of beginning or ending anything was weaning myself off the previous one, waiting a week or so, then titrating up on the new one until at a therapeutic dose...and suffering in the meantime. Docs are only available by voicemail. Sucks."

I have taken most depression meds for depression, most benzodiazepine meds for anxiety and most hypnotics and non-hypnotics for insomnia. Non of them will gave me or will give you the beneficial stage 3 & 4 recuperative sleep that you need. Lexapro for 2.5 years fixed the depression and anxiety but the insomnia never went away. My doctor put me on 15 mg of Remeron and after 2 weeks I felt as though I was 10 years younger. The great sleep I now get makes me feel fantastic during the day. It does take 2 full weeks to kick in though. It is the only med I have taken that dramatically improved my sleep architecture, meaning that I now get to stage 3 and 4 whereas previously I hadn't attained in about 5 years. A great nights sleep also helps keep any depression and anxiety away. I wish that this was the first med I was prescribed, it would have saved me a lot of wear and tear on my mind and body. If you have trouble sleeping I urge you to ask your doctor about this med. It has changed my life.

I started suffering from depression and anxiety which started to become severe. My 7 year relationship with my girlfriend also ended suddenly. Now I stand to lose my house because of the seperation. I started taking 15mg for 6 weeks, then increased dose to 30mg. After initial adjustment, the medication has helped with sleep, depression and anxiety. I have had no panic attacks, and anxiety levels have returned to normal. This medication has helped get me back on track after some extreme stressful situations. I believe this medication can be beneficial if the individual also makes a concious effort to improve quality of life.  YOU CAN DO IT!

All of the SSRIs had the sexual side effects on me and Wellbutrin had no effect on me.  When my doctor first prescribed this I did not really have much faith and I was nervous from all of the negative reviews on here.  On the first day I was sooo tired and sooo zoned out that I could not function.  I was on 15mg so I went back to 7.5 and I was fine and then a few days later I was up to 15mg again and I felt the low mood and anxiety diminish which was amazing to me.  It was effective for me almost 3 days after starting it.  Now, the reasons I only have it 3 stars for my satisfaction level is because I gained 5 lbs in this first two week period.  I have to say that I eat ALOT of fried sugary food and so as of today I am going to buy a scale and try to eat healthier and see what happens.  I really like the effect because it has really diminished my obsessive thoughts...I hope I don't gain 100lbs :)

After taking the first dose I had trouble getting to sleep and felt like I had restless leg syndrome.  After that subsided, I began to have really strange dreams, was constantly irritable, moody and developed a left eye twitch.  At times, I also felt like I was seeing things in a surreal way.  I also felt like I had no emotions.  I felt like a zombie. It did help me sleep through the night but I couldn't appreciate how it made me feel during the day.  I called my Doctor after being on it for about two weeks and requested to go back on Zoloft.  After this experience, I think I can handle the side effects that at first I thought were difficult to deal with (hair loss, waking up through the night).

It made me a total zombie. I could barely complete sentences the first 2 weeks. It made me very tired and I could NOT STOP eating! Higher doses supposedly give you less side effects, so I went up to 30mg. One night I forgot to take my meds so I took them at 5 am. When I got up at 8am, I fainted in my bathroom. It was really scary!!!! Also, I have gained 10-15 pounds over the last few months. However, after the first few weeks the sleepiness and fogginess subsided.

Yes, I feel better, but I also take Celexa. Also my anxiety has lessened, so there's less to be depressed about. I am going off of Remeron now—mostly because I can't stand the weight gain.

It was and is a Godsend for me. I have recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and my Dr prescribed Lyrica. The combination of Remeron and Lyrica proved to be dangerous for me - I passed out and fell into a chair, while trying to get back to bed after going to the bathroom one night about 2 weeks into taking both medication. I lay where I fell for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Turned out I had broke all the little bones in the upper part of my cheek on the left side. So my Dr changed my medication for depression to Elavil. I will be talking to my Dr to change me back to the Remeron, as I can not take Lyrica of Cymbalta for my Firbo. - I am one of the 15% who gets increased paing on these meds. I much prefer the Remeron, as it also helps several other symptems of Fibro. ie; IBS,anxiety, Also Elavil caused me to crave sweets and carbhydrates and I have gained 15# and my LDL Cholestrol and Triglycerides have risen a lot. I never had these problems on Remeron. and see from reading other articles on this site, Remeron helps with these conditions also. I also slept MUCH better on Remeron! I really like how I feel, and how I sleep on this med. and would recommened that you give it a try if you have any of the deseases it helps treat.

I was in a severe depression, tried several other medications (that were not effective) and finally took remeron.  I felt better within a few days of taking the medication.

752$Condition: Depression$8/3/2008 11:58:09 AM$Reviewer: Jane, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"Remeron has been the only antidepressant that hasn't caused major negative side effects in my case. I take it in addition to Vistaril, and though the effects are very sedating, I think it's a plus in cases of severe depression. I could only see this being used for less severe/mild depression in very low doses, since it knocks down your energy level. Even after eight hours of sleep, I would still be drowsy throughout the day. I have been on Remeron for over a year, and since then (and with the Vistaril) my condition has improved. After time, the drowsiness begins to wear off and it was about that time that I was prescribed the Vistaril in addition. Has not affected my appetite or weight, and was also used in addtion to therapy (psychiatrist). 
Again, I've been on many different types of antidepressants and have only seen positive results with this drug, though it varies with different people. I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety disorder. Started treatment at fourteen years old, went on Remeron at sixteen and am currently 17 and have begun tapering off medications. Not 100% better, but have reached position where I am able to move on."

766$Condition: Depression$4/5/2008 10:52:21 PM$Reviewer: Saved by Remeron, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$To all of you who are thinking of stopping the medication because of weight gain, feeling like a zombie, those terrible nightmares, lack of sex drive, etc... I too have had all of these side effects. Before starting treatment on Remeron coupled with Lexapro (after trying every other drug on the market and suffering for 5+ years) I truly was ready to die. I had no will to live, I was angry at everything! I truly/sadly was Suicidal and Homocidal.  I would fall asleep within 5-15 minutes of taking it (the reason you take it before bed) no matter what I was doing, EATING, talking, painting my nails. I would also get this feeling of bugs crawling up and down my legs, which was discerning and extremely uncomfortable. And, I too had that INSAITIABLE APPETITE, 30lbs in the first 5months of treatment. That passed. ALL the side effects passed. My appetite is healthier now, but I'm not eating 5 candybars at once now, followed by a couple more! No terrible nightmares, no creepy crawly feelings, no more zombie girl, and I haven't gained any additional weight since the initial 30lbs. I have returned to earth! I have earned my bachelors degree in nursing and have been practicing for 1+ year. I've become married, bought a house, and am excited to live again! The last 4 years have been the best I'd had in a long time. The benefits have far outweighed the temporary side effects. Isn't your happiness worth it?!

HUGE HELP!  only prob is my new INSATIABLE appetite.  at first i thought it was just that my moods were improving (when you don't feel like living, eating just isn't that interesting) but it got worse (CONSTANT thoughts of foods in the fridge, cravings for anything and everything-luckily i also crave raw veggies) & my clothes felt tighter...i believe i have gained 15+ lbs in these last 3.5 weeks...ugh!  i hope the appetite settles down soon, as i don't want to have to stop this med and spiral back down mentally...but i also can't continue putting on weight...how to balance mental health with physical health (weight,etc.)??? overall, though, i am very thankful for this med.

770$Condition: Depression$3/20/2008 4:26:28 PM$Reviewer: NoMoreWorries, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has done wonders for my depression, anxiety, and sleeplessness.  I currently take 30mg with 150mg of Zoloft, and I feel great.  As for side effects, even when I'm full.  Some people complain about being tired the next day, but it's nothing compared to the exhaustion from not sleeping at all.  Overall, this medication is extremely effective.

Dreams arent worse or more frequent than before, but hubby says I talk alot more in my sleep. sleep is better with much less waking in the middle, but tend to oversleep through the alarm. No grogginess during the day. Already have high triglycerides so I'll have to keep an eye on that. So far so good, depression & PTSD improving. will update any changes.

774$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$3/1/2008 12:42:02 AM$Reviewer: casey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I took this med for situational and i needed to eat, i now know why my dr. at the time, chose this medicaiton for that.
This medication worked very well for me. I have been taking it for-wow didn't realize-6 or 7 yrs. now. The truths are the weight gain. I gained weight and excercise didn't seem to help that much. However, after awhile on the medication, my body must have leveled out and i started to lose the weight with regular excercise. there is a drug they can give you to counter act the weight gain, but it also has it's side effects. I have also experienced hair loss. I did'nt relate it to the drug at the time, or maybe i did but it was working so i shrugged it off. My hair, 7 yrs. later, seems A LOT different. First there is a lot less of it, and second the texture seems to have also changed. I am now also experiencing muscle pain. Which, i also didn't relate to the medication until today. My dr. knew i was on it and I went to him for the pain, and he didn't even mention that it could be a side effect, he just wanted to put me on another med. and deemed it restless leg.. and I KNOW IT IS NOT THAT, but he couldn't figure out what it was. I just read on this website that muscle pain could be a side effect. Doesn't mean it will be and if the remeron is what is causing that, it took a very long time to happen. I am not on a high dose either, only 15mg. So, maybe it is time to get off and /or go to an even lower dose. It also took seven years to make really do a job on my hair. 
It did work for me, i didn't have any of the sexual, or numb side effects that other people complain about with other meds. I still think it works great. I  still feel without being depressed for abnormal lengths of time. I still get depressed / i mean sad or whatever, but it is manageable and it lasts about as long as sad feelings should (whatever that means). Anyway, i think dr.'s need to work on their diagnosing  skills. My dr. should have related the muscle pain to the drug. "

779$Condition: Depression$2/20/2008 10:56:21 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$4$I have only been on Remeron for 5 days, in addition to Effexor, but I feel like a zombie.  It does help me with my sleeplessness and I do get into a deep hard sleep, which is good, but the next day I am so tired and spaced out.  I haven't noticed an improvement in my overall mood yet, maybe it is too soon.  I haven't had any crying spells for a couple of days but I feel like I could at any time.  I don't have any energy or desire to do anything.  My fuse is short and I get upset or angry easily.  I don't have any increased hunger yet so I guess that is good.  I hope all of these symptoms get better or I will have to stop this med. and try something else.

It will put you into a ""fog"" when waking up for the first 1-2 weeks, then that side effect wears off.  I have found it more effective than any other anti-depressent but only moderatly effective after all.  It will put you to sleep upon taking it, if you don't sleep you will feel like you took about 4 tylenol PMs.  I don't sleep very well and this drug seems to make me dream, but sometimes the dreams are full of anxiety.  I would suggest trying this drug if you've found that none of the standard drugs have worked.  I settled on 30mg after much experimenting."
