1$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$11/6/2016 3:28:03 PM$Reviewer: Gina, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I have a very high tolerance to medication but after 1mg morning and night of Fanapt I felt completely horrible. I thought I might be catching the flu or something but then I realized it was the medicine. It made me feel so out of it. I was drowsy, slow moving and thinking, felt like I was going to faint when I got up and walked around, got headaches, my heart kept racing which made my anxiety worse. I was surprised how strong this medication effected me in such a short time and small dose. Not for me!

It is an 'atypical' which is generally not prescribed for this however my doc wanted to try it since other RX weren't having much effect. The side effects were overwhelming with racing heart rate, low blood pressure, muscle aches, fatigue, drowsiness and dizziness being the worst. One major reason I stopped is because of the potential increase in aggression. I'm a competitive athlete and naturally aggressive and I do not want my aggression to become worse or violent. I've already injured myself prior to taking Fanapt due to my natural 'safe' aggressive behavior and recklessness but I do not want it to become a problem of violence where I could hurt others.

One other side effect that can affect athletes or people who exercise regularly is the abnormal rise in heart rate. My resting heart rate is between 40-50 which is very low. I noticed that my heart races to approximately 120 beats per minute or so just doing simple chores around the house. 120 beats per minute is normally a very vigorous workout for me so this is a crazy situation. Fanapt made exercise and training impossible.

Maybe this medication can help others who are resistant to the side effects however the cons outweigh the pros for me. This RX is a no go for me."

   Lastly - Sudden: faintness, inability to walk without being held, and steadily dropping blood pressure (HYPO- TENSION) at dangerous level."
19$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$5/1/2012 9:50:52 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I've been on Fanapt for several months now.  I am asking my doc to take me off of it.  It hasn't helped with my depression.  What's worse is that I've developed urinary incontinence which isn't listed in the side effects; however, when I researched it further, I learned it does cause incontinence in 10% of all cases.  I also am having moderate memory loss.  Maybe it will work for someone else, but it hasn't worked for me.

Am taking 4mg twice a day and it really has helped me in the long run. Have been on it for almost two years. The down side is the expense. I am going off it as my copay for it is 230$ a month. The other thing is lack of sex drive.. poor results there. Have had blurred vision with it and very dry mouth."
26$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$10/12/2011 4:44:02 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I was taking this medication for bipolar disorder.  While taking the titration pack, I couldn't take anything over 2mg. At 2mg on the second day I was awake for 38 hours.  I went back to 1mg.  At this dosage my legs became twitchy, my nose became congested and diahrrea became an issue during the day.  At night I had to sleep sitting up in a recliner due to extreme acid reflux. This medication wasn't for me.

Hope it lasts! I feel energetic, happy, jokey even! Side effects of dizziness has lessened, but still have extreme dry mouth.

Seems to have calmed me down some.  Side effects have been drowsiness, dizziness, head spins, lots of dry mouth.  Not sure if it's helping yet, but will update later when I've been on it longer.
