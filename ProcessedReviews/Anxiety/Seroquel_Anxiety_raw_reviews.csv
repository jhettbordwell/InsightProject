151$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/30/2019 12:06:23 PM$Reviewer: George, 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug was a miracle. It changed my life. I suffered from chronic insomnia and my jaw was clenched most of the day and teeth grinding at night. It cured me. I've been on this drug from about 10 years so my experience with Seroquel if long term.

It helped with anxiety,but made me half brain-dead. i couldn't keep up with the simplist of conversations and was in a daze constantly.my grades dropped dramatically. i got off it and my head felt so much clearer.
174$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/17/2018 12:36:53 AM$Reviewer: Mat, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This is the only medication that works for me. I can sleep,I don t have racing thoughts anymore at night, and I'm calmer. I,also take ativan along with it to prevent panic attacks at while I'm asleep. The combo is very effective for me. It is a miracle drug that treats all my symptoms. 
176$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/4/2018 10:04:53 PM$Reviewer: Kennls, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$This is a dangerous drug which should not be prescribed for anxiety. It makes you lose contact with reality. The fuzziness lasted all day and caused memory loss. I had all of the negative side effects to the power of 10. The severe loss of muscle strength made the dizziness dangerous. I was unable to function and still find it difficult to focus. Why it was prescribed is a mystery. I am changing psychiatrists. Not a go to drug for anyone.

205$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/16/2016 2:03:41 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$Horrible. This drug is being pushed for profit. I gained 50 lbs and after stopping did not take the weight off even though i was thin all my life. I had HORRIBLE restless leg syndrome that got worse and worse over time. then they wanted to give me BENZOS for the restless leg syndrome. This is an antipsychotic with very poor evidence that is effective for anything, It causes more problems than it begins to relieve. Its a nightmare. Run away! It also causes death in the elderly. How does it even get approved by the FDA? Drug company execs sit on the FDA.  Big Problem. My friend got tardive dyskinesia and has still not recovered! 
2593$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/24/2019 2:19:48 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$2$3$I have been on 50 mg of Seroquel XR for 7 years with 1 mg of ativan when I need it. At first the medicine did wonders for me. I could sleep at night, wasn't having panic attacks on a daily basis, anxiety went down, and I felt normal again. However, after being on the same dose of it this long I am no longer getting those affects from it. Also I don't have bipolar or schizophrenia so don't know how useful it is to me anymore. I would say for people who need short term relief from severe anxiety/panic it is very helpful. I would say after taking it for about three or four years then I would get off it. The long term side effects are not worth it.
