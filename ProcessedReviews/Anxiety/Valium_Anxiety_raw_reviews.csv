6$Anxious$11/1/2019 11:18:14 AM$Reviewer: fufon5, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I don't know WHY everyone loves this medication. I have tried the REAL Roche Brand Valium AND the generic and they both suck; either on high or low doses. I have severe anxiety, PTSD and symptoms of DID. My old psych. thought this was med was the messiah of benzos!  The only thing that works for me is lorazepam/Ativan, Klonopin/clonazepam or Xanax/alprazolam - which I do not like taking, but will they will help my panic.  I had a severe panic attack with dissociation and kept taking diazepam and waited and waited for it to work to kill the attack - it took forever.  If I had any other Benzo, like lorazepam or Klonopin it would have killed the panic attack in 20 minutes.  Thumps down for diazepam for me. However, everyone is different.  It's supposed to be a good med to wean off other benzos.

20$Anxious$1/23/2016 1:22:37 PM$Reviewer: Blondie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has saved my life.  I suffer from chronic anxiety and no other medications have helped.  I have tried so many.  I started taking it 30 years ago and many Dr's have advised that I stop.  I did stop for 1 year about 8 years ago and it was the worst year that I can remember.   I hate that it is habit forming but it is the only thing I have found that helps me get through the day.  I will probably have to take if for the rest of my life and I am fine with that, if only every new doctor I saw would not try to be the one who can get me off of it!!  They make it for a reason.  I keep my dosage between 10 and 20 mg per day.

22$Anxious$6/17/2015 1:39:50 PM$Reviewer: Lawro, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$I use Diazepam for anxiety and insomnia a couple of days a week. Overall its a very effective medication but as with all benzodiazepines tolerance builds up over a few weeks and months. I find the anxiolytic effects remain fairly constant but with daily use its loses most of its efficacy at treating insomnia. Physically addictive so only use once or twice weekly now

49$Anxious$9/17/2013 12:44:44 AM$Reviewer: WorkingThroughIt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$4$"I was diagnosed with Victim PTSD & GAD after a summer of mild panic attacks and GP Dr trying all the ""new"" medications that didn't help. I went to a psychiatrist after a very severe attack and, although none of the SSRIs they wanted me on helped (all horrible side effects) this medication has stayed with me for 6+ years. At one point I was able to taper off to a mere 1mg 3xday, but stress related to PTSD caused me to have to return to 15mg a day. My Dr has me on a irregular schedule where I take different amounts throughout the day which really helps me. I take very little in the morning, but the most in the afternoon. Very rarely, like the holidays, I need to take an extra few mgs for a racing heartbeat. Other than short term memory loss I have had no negative sides. I always keep a notepad and pen with me now. Although I'd like to taper off again someday, if the option is any of the other meds or this med and my notepad, I'll take diazepam the rest of my life as it works so well for me."

56$Anxious$5/3/2013 1:31:11 PM$Reviewer: Pillsdonotalwayshelp, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have depression, anxiety and PSTD. I have some bad days and Diazepam is my drug of choice as it seems to level me out and even 5mg puts me in a much better mood. 

My other half tells me to take them some days. I am glad when someone else knows I am in trouble as I may not know it as I am sure others may not know either. But what a relief to me and anyone around me Diazpam is.

 I wish I had taken this and never tried any antidepressants, which I no longer take. This little pills just lightens up those bad days. 

Best drug I have tried to help me. I pray no side effects and I DO NOT use it daily because I do not want an addiction and I want that 5mg pill to work when I need it to.  It only stays in the liver 2 days so that helps as the liver has been effected by other pills in the past. Happy this one has not turned me yellow! I am hoping to no longer need them some day. But for now, I am happy they help.

Highly suggested for anyone like be who has been thru a lifetime of hurt and surgeries and needs a little help.

 I do not drive under any medication, even diazapam. You never know what a drug will do to your mind and if I hurt anyone with my car, I would never forgive myself if I were taking any drug that alters moods or mind or not for that matter. 
You can always take your pill when you get to work and it has its 8 or so hours to work. No sense taking it before work, not when you are driving.

It is a drug, but a good one as far as I am concerned. 
May God Bless..."

This is the best, most effective medicine for me. I can still drive, work, and carry on a normal life. But I will have to remain on it the rest of my life. All pshcho's would tell me is take a deep breath, take a walk, read a book, find your happy place. None of these things worked. Most Dr.s dont want to give out anxiety meds. But believe me, I need them. Just wish I could find a Dr. that talks over me, and just wants to throw me on antidepressants (which I'm not depressed at all) but they tend to think they know my body better than I.

79$Anxious$3/5/2012 6:04:12 PM$Reviewer: BarneyFife, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Years ago I was prescribed 5mg 3 times per day for acute anxiety and depression related to 'adjustment to adult life'.  I took Valium for about 3 months, then weened myself off.  It was as if a switch had been thrown, turning off my panic and turning on simple normalcy.  I credit Valium for saving my life.  In recent years I have used it during episodes of acute lower back spasm, and once again it has come to the rescue.  I use it only for the purpose intended and for the minimum length of time required for resolution of the problem.  Haven't noticed any negative side effects other than a mild sedation which is a good thing during a panic attack.  In my experience, this is one of those rare chemicals I can call a 'wonder drug', but it must be used appropriately, following the recommendations of a doctor or WebMD or the PDR.  Don't take it lightly.

97$Anxious$7/29/2011 9:20:11 PM$Reviewer: j2ny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have used this medicine successfully for anixiety, panic attacks for the past 11 years.  That said, it has been 11 years...I cannot get OFF it!  I tried to STOP, I wound up in the HOSPITAL! I am back on diazepam!  I would caution anyone to speak with their doc about an exit strategy prior to starting, unless they WANT a life-long committment.  It does not appear to have negative impacts on my day-to-day functioning (I can drive, work, go to school, etc.).  The only other thing is that at times undue stress causes increased dosage requirements (my prescribed dose is 5 mg 3 times/day).

This medication has given me my life back. I no longer suffer from full blown terrifying panic attacks. My Doctor and I agreed to do a very slow and systematic tapper and I want to become benzo free. My Doctor and I feel it is OK to take in acute situations but I do not want to take this every day.

224$Anxious$9/27/2008 11:47:49 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I've used this for minor anxiety off and on for about a decade. It keeps me from slipping into full-blown panic attacks and allows a general feeling of control back to my life.
I hate to say it like this, but after taking this it feels - to me - like I felt back in the days when I drank like I'd had one or two beers. I am calm but not loopy. I feel good but not in an artificial way. I'm still alert enough to function - on one 5mg.
I've used Xanax before and either one works fine. If you start to feel one is not working as well as before you may want to discuss alternating between the two with your doctor to keep your body from becoming too used to either one.
I only gave 4 stars for satisfaction because my only issue with the medication is that it can make me sleepy if I'm already predisposed to feeling tired, e.g. late at night, hard day at work, etc.."

232$Anxious$9/6/2008 8:48:26 PM$Reviewer: Lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$" I LOVE this drug.  I have been using it sparingly and only ""as needed"" for almost 20 years.  It is just as effective today as it was back then, and at the same dosage.  If I feel very anxious I take 2.5mg and I am calmer within a very short time.  If I need a good night's sleep and feel anxious, I take 2.5mg to 5mg and sleep happily for a good 6 hours. ( I need 8 hours, but this med lasts for 6 hours ).  I am 5'8 and weigh 128lbs. yet those dosages work great for me.  The greatest benefit I found was that having taken this med off & on and sparingly ""as needed"", I was able to mimick (without the drug) the CALM feeling that it gave me.  The mind is a powerful thing! It takes years of working on, but I couldn't have done it alone (without this drug).  I am at relative peace now because I am older and wiser AND because I have a great store of this drug incase I need it.  If you suffer severe Panic Attacks or severe Anxiety that you can't calm down by yourself, I highly recommend careful use of this drug. Others sware by Xanax... never tried that one.     Hang in there."

Take Valium on and off as needed for mild GAD and â??anticipatory anxietyâ?? (i.e. pre-travel). It also helps with morning depression. Itâ??s the only prescription med I take. Have tried several SSRIâ??s with some success, but prefer valium because it works with almost no side effects. While on Valium, after eating a meal, I may doze off for 20 or so minutes. Combination of the meal and the Valium. When taking, usually itâ??s 5mg at bedtime. Sleep better, longer, with fewer disturbing dreams. May take a 2nd 5mg during really anxious days (i.e. when packing for a trip). Will take for a couple of weeks while traveling, and no problem stopping except maybe a day of mild depression. Doesnâ??t conflict with my before-supper 2 glasses of wine, except when on Valium the size of those glasses may be smaller (more relaxed to begin with). According to blood tests over the years, doesnâ??t seem to have affected any vital organs (kidneys, liver). Continues to be a lifesaver!

I don't take it all the time only when I have consistent anxiety and it does help the awful closed throat, heavy heart feeling I get before I have an anxiety attack. The only problem is if I have a really bad panic attack it takes about 20 minutes to kick in and in those instances it's not quick enough. In general though this has been very effective to help calm me down with no real adverse side effects. This does not make me sleepy or groggy but I know some people that say it's a bit too much. Just watch it because it is a Benzo and it can be addictive. I only use it when I have to and haven't ever felt any withdrawal from starting and stopping as needed but that's not to say someone else wouldn't experience those not so pleasant symptoms listed as possible side effects. Just be cautious and use your better judgement while taking this.

310$Anxious$1/25/2015 3:02:37 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Valium is the best benzo for long term, chronic anxiety and panic disorder. However, the hardest thing is if you ever have to stop it without switching to another benzo.  The 2 side effects I had were the occasional headache associated with tiredness. Valium has the longest half life of any benzo and that is arguably why it is the hardest to stop after long term use. Be careful.

330$Anxious$11/20/2013 12:33:26 AM$Reviewer: Working Man, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"Sure, there's plenty of newer, 'more powerful' benzodiazepines that've been introduced in the past 30 years (e.g., Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin)-- I've tried many of them -- but diazepam (Valium) is still the best. And safest. Here's why:

1). It's relaxing & uplifting in the most mild way. It doesn't cause wacky behavior nor give the appearance that the user is 'on something'.
2). It's long acting. You don't need to cling to a pill bottle all day. One small dose gives all-day benefit.
3.) It doesn't cause mental depression, like so many minor tranqilizers do.

I like to take a 5 mg. pill in the morning, before work. It 'loosens me up', making that tense pre-workday mood disappear. It helps me organize myself, in a cheerful way. That's the best way I can describe it. I don't take another until the next morning. And many times I don't even need to do that. Diazepam the very best of the benzodiazepines and minor tranquilizers. Speaking from experience."

370$Anxious$3/20/2012 1:58:59 AM$Reviewer: Fortressofcomfort, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$Overall diazepam is the best benzo ever.  I suffer from anxiety disorder and occasional panic attack (when anxiety is very high for prolonged periods of time).  Clonazepam turns me into a zombie (good for periods of insomnia though) alprazolam causes me much amnesia and just seems too strong, and lorazepam and Serax just don't last very long requiring multiple doses each day.  I occasionally have my doc switch me around but I always come back to good old Valium.  It just seems to have the best combination of therapeutic action for anxiety and, at 5mg doses, does not turn me into a non functioning zombie or make me sleepy.  Proper use of diazepam has absolutely improved my life overall.  I've been taking 5-10mg a day, a low dose, for 2 years now and would hate to have to give it up.  It is also very non-addictive, and when used appropriately does not have an significant withdrawal symptoms.  For anyone suffering from moderate to severe anxiety, or panic attacks, ask your doctor to let you try simply 5mg of Valium taken in the evening.  Greetings and cheers from a fellow worrywart lol.
378$Anxious$12/10/2011 2:26:51 AM$Reviewer: Fortressofcomfort, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Great!  I take 5-10mg a day usually a couple hours before bed.  It allows me to unwind and relax and stops my mind from racing and wandering.  Have taken for 2 yrs now with no side effects.  It is also easy to stop taking (no withdrawal) but it stays in your system (and is detectable in urine) for a good 3 weeks.  The only caveat is that if you abuse it (take too much) it will lead to depression, so stick to the lowest dose that works.  It is also good for occasional insomnia at higher doses (10-15mg) but stops working for that after only a couple days of use.  Summary: an effective old school 'chill pill' that is safe and easy to use.  P.s. I have used Klonipim and Xanax before and actually prefer the Valium because it lasts longer and doesn't make me tired at the usual 5mg dose.  Cheers!

408$Anxious$3/8/2011 1:16:25 PM$Reviewer: LadyOwl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"Valium, aka ""Mommy's lil' helpers"" had been a godsend for me.   I'd been taking it, 10mg tabs, 3x a day, #90/month for 10 years. Now THAT is a miracle as it is. On top of opiate pain meds for chronic back pain as well! All depends on the doctor. Some won't even R/x you an aspirin. 
Well, anyway, since it's so broad, it helped my muscle spasms, GAD, (General Anxiety Disorder) insomnia, migriaines, tension, PTSD, etc. So, that's the good thing about it. 
Bad thing is that after so long, like all the benzodiazapines, you get tolerant to it, and you can take half the bottle, and it doesn't phase you. *NO, I do NOT recommend that, lol)* 
But doc told me after 10+ years (Never asked for an increase in dose ever), the half life is very long, about 3 days. So even though you don't feel it, it's still in your system. So if you pop a Vicodin or something, chances are you're gonna wind up on the floor. That's the downside.
So, as I'm on Methadone 10mg. for chronic back pain, sciatica, Lortab 10mg. for breakthrough pain, (close your mouth, you'll catch a fly), he's decided to cut the Valium, and switch me back to Ativan 1mg. Fine by me, works great, and don't have to worry Doc about the half life. Methadone has a VERY long half life, so I was dancing with death the whole time, and didn't realize it! So, it may be great, but it's a good idea to keep check on your dosage, especially if you're taking opiate painkillers, etc... "

463$Anxious$1/8/2010 1:58:33 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$5$"I've had 2 separate periods of diazepam use. The first was from 1982-99 for generalized anxiety and Meniere's Disease.  It worked very well for both.  However, I am also a recovering alcoholic who has to be careful with drugs like this and when I got sober in 1999, I quit using valium.  Then this past May (2009), I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and my anxiety (and some Meniere's symptoms like vertigo, etc.)came back roaring. I had shortness of breath and a tremendously amplified startle reflex. So, I asked my GP to put me back on low levels of valium, which he did. He also put me on Ambien. My cancer surgery in July was successful and by October, I felt ready to come off both valium and ambien. But my addictive brain (remember, I'm a recovering drunk) wasn't as ready and I was unsuccessful in my own attempt to taper off either drug.  So, I went to the p-doc at the local rehab center and she put me on Remeron and told me to try and get off the ambien first and we'd worry about the valium later.  So, now about 10 weeks later, I'm off ambien completely and am being maintained on 15mg. remeron and 3mg valium a day. This is a sub-clinical valium dose, but it still helps. We're going to stay here for the next 5 months or so and then, if the Remeron continues to work for me, taper the valium until I'm off it.
  Valium has historically been the only drug that has ever given me relief from my anxiety and I've been through a bushel basket of others from Buspar to Luvox to Lexapro. But because of my addictive personality, I need to be off it eventually.
And that's OK so long as the Remeron keeps working.
  So, with some reservations, I'd recommend short-course valium therapy to anybody with severe situational anxiety.  It works.  Watch it though and don't stay on it too long.  It makes all the sharp corners of the world round and while that is a nice feeling, it isn't the way the world really is. Be cautious with this drug, especially if you are prone to addiction."

I was given every anti-drepressant on the market but none of them took care of my anxiety and I have never had a problem with depression. Some doctors tried them to get me off valium, but they did not work on me. If I were 25, I wouldn't start it again because I know it's addictive, I read things.

The only stop was 5 years in psychoanalysis when the doctor claimed ""the therapeutic effect"" would be lost if on medicines !!!! Those years were COMPLETE HELL !!!! That day I stopped the psychoanalysis because (thank god!!!)the analyst should to into retirement, that day I started Valium (diazepam) 5mg/day again and IMMEDIATELY!!!!! got back to senses. How could I be so deceived by that shrink and not listen to school-medicine doctors!! Well an analysis-shrink colleague of him also having a radio show - praising the analysis - admitted in a book after his retirement that he had taken, wait ...Valium over all the years to manage his anxiety !!!!! (strong to do that) Well we know priests preaching A but doing P !!! I'm amazed when people now can report themselves, to see how great help this medicine is and how very, very few have any problems. Of course as chronic anxiety disorder is CHRONIC ... the anxiety will reappear when you stop the medication. The blood-sugar would certainly go up if stopped insulin !!!! Talk about being dependent on INSULIN.
I HOPE internet medical fora can force the psychotherapeutic maffia to where it belongs. The scrapyard!!!!

However about 3 months ago, I seemed to start up an immunity to it. Which can happen with this type of drug. I talked to my Dr. she now put me on something totally different and is slowly weening me off the Valium.

I was originally prescribed this because of several reasons; TMJ, PTSD, & insomnia. The 2nd night off of the med was when the withdrawl took effect. Over the course of the next 2wks, I felt near death, it was VERY scary. My blodd pressure soared to 158/128, had blurry vision al day, could not sleep for more that 45 mins @ at a time, sick to stomach, trembles, & basicall just felt like dying. While waiting to be seen for a new Dr, a family member provided me with Valium. I found it to be less ""harse"" with the same effcts,& if a miss a night or two, I don't feel much different. My new Dr gives me Ambien 10mg..it works O.K. for about 2 hrs then I wake up @ least 4 other times for a minute or two, just to toss & turn. To sum up my experience w/Xanax, Valium, & Ambien...Xanax is great if you have it but dangerous if you do not. Ambien wks just not long enough. Valium is the best by far. Relief without anyside effects.
One other ??..My husband wks Mids (has for 6 yrs.)He never sleeps over 4-5 hrs a day. I realize mids are vey difficult to the normal wk "
