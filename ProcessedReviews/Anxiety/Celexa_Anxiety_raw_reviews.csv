1$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/2/2019 9:03:25 PM$Reviewer: MyLife, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$On and off, Mostly on for 3 or so years. 1stly, effects were noticed by others before noticed by myself. Weight loss due to loss of appetite and then mild weight gain once I started feeling a little more care free. This 'drug' definitely helped with my anxiety. It made me overall very positive. Not 100% better but way more bearable. Helped with getting angry. All was great until I started to continuously notice this lack of empathy, cloudiness In what felt like my frontal lobe, my sex drive severely dropped, and then this major suicidal depression came like a freight train for some reason. Honestly It bummed me out but I knew getting off it was for the better. Now that I have been off of it for a few months, I like the natural feeling better. I think. My anxiety is back but I feel like I can deal with it better. My thoughts come easier. My memory is better.. It feels more 'real.'  However I still have a depressing cloud that lingers over me But SO much better then what was happening to me towards the end. I miss not getting angry so easy and the ease of having positive thoughts. However Im hoping that this experience has helped me learn how to balance things on my own without the help of a prescription. Overall it 'worked great,' My dosage might have needed to be changed. It could be the stressful but Im confident that being off medication is more the type of life I wanna live.

I was barely able to function. It worked at 10mg for a while, then once my baby was born, my dosage was increased to 20mg. I continued to take that dosage for about 2 years until I finally told my doctor that I don't notice a difference in my life and she then upped the dosage to 40mg. Now, I experience anxiety worse than before, along with insomnia and zero sexual interest. My husband and I have not been intimate in 6 months because of this. I see a new doctor next week and I honestly can't wait to try something different.

1608$Anxiousness associated with Depression$8/16/2017 6:28:31 PM$Reviewer: Steve peace, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$I was precribed celexa when I was in my teens. I took it for over 1 month and then stopped taking it for 2 months. Out of the blue for no reason at all I carried out an act of extreme violence and ended up in jail and then was found NCR. The police took my bottle of celexa away during the arrest. That was a very long time ago. Now im out I hired a lawyer and he got the legal system to purge my ncr records. My employment criminal background check has been clean every since. There is no record of it happening. It has been a very stressfull ordeal for me to deal with the system all these years.

I would get so nervous while driving I would shake and my heart felt like it was going to explode, I would get really dizzy. I mostly stayed home and it turned into depression. I had taken Celexa before as a teenager when dealing with anxiety, at that time it worked well for me but I got pregnant and stopped taking it since, that was 8 years ago. My doctor prescribed me to Celexa again and after about a month I started noticing that I was feeling so much better. I could drive without much anxiety at all. I wasn't shaking or feeling I was on the verge of an attack. I never realized how much anxiety was taking over my life. The only side effect is pretty bad dry mouth. I bought celexa here http://health-care24h.com/catalog/Depression/buy- Celexa.htm

1632$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/20/2016 6:21:34 AM$Reviewer: Anonymous, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I didn't realize how much it does for me until I stopped taking it for a couple weeks. Anxiety attacks are very rare and I almost never cry (this used to be a big problem). Doesn't improve my mood much, and sometimes I still can't get out of bed, but I don't get sick from the stress nearly as much. I haven't gained any weight, but my sex drive has been affected much more than I would prefer.

1636$Anxiousness associated with Depression$3/28/2016 1:26:04 PM$Reviewer: Logan, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was experiencing long term problems with anxiety and depression that I finally realized required medical help. After discussing the problems I was dealing with, my doctor prescribed 10mg of citalopram for me with instructions for a return consult in a couple weeks. I felt a little sedated at first but also much more at ease and less depressed. Wife quickly noticed the difference in my demeanor as well and now makes sure that I take the medication on schedule. I had some minor GI upset initially which dissipated. The only other problem with taking the drug was when my doctor increased the dose to 20mg, which caused some sexual difficulties. After contacting my doctor, I was instructed to reduce the dose back to 10mg a day or two before sex might be expected and then back to the 20mg dosage afterwards. I know, this disrupts spontaneity but the overall tradeoff is well worth it for both me and my wife. We're both very happy with the results of the drug.
1637$Anxiousness associated with Depression$3/22/2016 4:32:41 PM$Reviewer: Gemma523, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$Before starting this medication I was very nervous about the potential side effects I read about online and other users negative reviews. I have now been on celexa (citalopram 20 mg) for a little over a month and I haven't experienced any negative side effects other than drowsiness after taking the medication. I take it before going to sleep at night so that it does not affect my daily routine. It wasn't until about the 4th week that I began to notice that my anxiety had decreased significantly. I used to become completely overcome with anxiety and worrying almost daily and I have now gone an entire week without becoming anxious at all. I do still experience anxious thoughts on occasion but I am now able to redirect my thinking and let them go rather than obsessively focusing on them and becoming depressed. I have never reviewed anything like this before but as there are so many bad reviews out there I thought it was important to let people know that my experience has been nothing but positive.

I thought nothing was wrong with me just had to much on me,then someone said you need to find a doctor  to write you something for depression. I thought about that for awhile then decided to do so . the doctor wrote me celexa. i've been on  it for a week. I sleep fine but i'm still sleepy through he day at work and when i get home a crash. I have noticed that things that were bothering me do not as much now 
1640$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/27/2016 11:09:11 PM$Reviewer: hj503, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been taking Celexa for almost 6 months now and it has been a blessing for me. I take 40 mg every night right before bed and it has helped control my anxiety and depression. I have had anxiety and depression and have been medicated for as long as I can remember. Celexa has been the best medicine for me so far and I have been on plenty of other anxiety and depression medicines. I notice when something begins to upset me or stresses me out, I become slightly dizzy and it feels a little like I'm having an out of body experience to the slightest degree. The feeling and dizziness fade quickly once I'm able to calm down. It's nothing horrible and it doesn't bother me much because the good effects from this medicine outweigh this side effect. I don't have the ""numb"" feeling that everybody talks about. I still feel happy, sad, and angry like I should. I'm just able to get through my days without the crippling effects of anxiety and depression. It was a little hard for me the first few weeks because I was convinced it wasn't working and I felt like my anxiety was actually increasing. But I stuck with it faithfully and at about 6 weeks, I started to feel pretty good. I stopped having so many anxiety episodes during the day and I noticed I was a slightly bit more optimistic about life. I knew it was FINALLY starting to help and it has continually helped me more and more the longer I have stuck with it. I know Celexa isn't for everybody but it's been a literal life saver for me and I'm pleased with the mental progress I've been able to make since being on it. "
1642$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/12/2016 4:06:11 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Went to the doctor for worsening frequency of panic attacks; never wanted to take medication but got to the point where I was not able to do my job.  Started this and within 2 weeks completely stopped having the attacks.  Overall I feel happier than I ever have, and so much less anxious.  My sex drive isn't as high as it used to be, I have almost no appetite (I only eat because I know I'm supposed to, and hypoglycemia contributes to panic episodes), and I have occasional nausea that goes away quickly, but these side effects are 100% worth it.  I am happy (don't know when I've ever been able to say that) and most importantly, I am able to do my job again!

My husband and daughter call it "" my happy pill"".  It has worked very very well for me and I dare not run out of it. I do suffer from with anxiety and depression and have been on many different types of meds for it but Celexa works best for me than any other drug. I have not had any side effects from using Celexa"
1656$Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/23/2015 9:50:19 PM$Reviewer: Lexi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$"I took this medication for about 3 months to treat my anxiety and depression. The first two months I had a lot of nausea always about 1 hour after taking celexa, however, it worked amazing to relieve my anxiety and depression. For the first time in years, I was able to relax and was happy. After the second month though, I just began to feel numb. I didn't care about anything. Things that used to upset me no longer did, but things that used to make me smile didn't affect me either. But my depression prior was severe, so I stayed on it and focused on learning about myself and how unreasonable it is to feel unnecessary anxiety leading to depression. And things were better.

The reason I stopped taking celexa is because it caused SEVERE MEMORY LOSS. It started small. I couldn't remember what happened yesterday. Then, after month two, I couldn't remember conversations people would tell me I had with them. And at the end of month three, I was standing in front of a desk somewhere  (I don't even remember where I was) with a woman in front of me asking me what my name was. I stared blankly at her. I couldn't remember. I apologized and had to pull out my wallet and look at my drivers license to remember my middle name. I then began researching the drug and discovered that memory loss is a common side affect. I immediately stopped taking it, but it still took me about 3 months for my memory to return to normal. But on a positive note, it  feels back to normal now (about 1 year later) I apologized to my friends and let them know what I was going through, and surprisingly, one of my friends who I've known to have memory problems told me that he was taking the same medication. He ended up cutting his dose in half afterwards and noticed an improvement in memory. I still recommend it as a relief from the pit of anxiety and depression, so you can understand how life should feel, but I would never recommend it long term. Use the time on it to learn how to live."

After a year, I bumped up to 40mg (from 20). It was too much and I hated the effects (i don't remember exactly but i dropped back to 20). I wish there were a 30mg pill. I tried breaking a 20 in half and making 30's but it was never a clean cut in the pill so the daily dose was not consistently 30 and i just dropped to 20. after now two years, I feel its not working the same for me although i don't often get the rage attacks I did when off of them.

Any who, I stopped taking the Citalopram after week 3 (and a 1/2) and went back to Cymbalta. My reasons for the switch are this. #1 I became increasingly forgetful or would blank out very important work details. Not like me at all to forget jobs! #2 I started to have involuntary muscle tightening. #3 I yawned uncontrollably at times. Other than those problems it did help my anxiety but it was not the answer for me. I was able to work through the sleeplessness at early morning Hours I had listed in my first review and noticed no other side effect. But the ones I did experience were unacceptable. So I guess I will shell out the big bucks for the med that is right for me. "
127$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/5/2014 10:20:59 AM$Reviewer: Kat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I was on Cymbalta several years ago for depression and anxiety due to life experiences and I felt as I should. I felt ok, still with emotion but ok and not overwhelmed. I moved to a new state 7 years ago and could not afford my med for a very long time due to layoffs, no insurance, etc. I have recently been able to go back and restart on Citalopram after realizing that I still suffer from anxiety, occasional panic attacks, slight depression and irritability. I am only on day 3...... Day 1; Took 20mg on Friday night before bed, woke up at 3am and could not get back to sleep (this to me is very upsetting because I have struggled for the last few years with sleep issues and recently purchased a new tempurpedic mattress that has totally fixed that problem, now I'm back to not sleeping all night)  I was lethargic and made very deliberate and slow moves all day, although I felt fine. Day 2; Same problem after taking it at night woke up between 3 and 5 AM and could not get back to sleep. The rest of the day however, I felt just fine, no more grogginess just normal. Day 3; Woke up again at 4/5 am but had taken a melatonin before I went to bed and I was able to fall back asleep. Tonight,  I will be taking the melatonin earlier this evening and my 20mg Citalopram right before I close my eyes! So far I feel fine except I did realize when I drink coffee on an empty stomach I get very tired and once I eat I fell fine again. I haven't had any major irritability, stress or anxiety since taking this but still a few weird and uncomfortable thoughts, which is mild for my incredibly over active brain. I am also having hot/cold flashes but it isn't that bothersome. So far, so good.  It has also completely curbed my nicotine urge which is fantastic since I was on my 11 attempt to quit. I absolutely need more time to see if this med follows through or falls short and will revisit my review in another 3 weeks.

I worked up to the highest dose.  About the time I was thinking I would start lowering the dose, and maybe try to go off of it, my 26 yr. old daughter was killed in a horrific car crash that left my 4 month grandson mentally disabled for life, and with partial blindness.  My husband and I took the baby boy and my daughter's 8 yr. old girl to raise, even though I was weary from raising my own 5 kids.  I found quickly that I still needed the med, and don't know what I would do without it, as I am under a tremendous amount of stress. I have also learned to help control anxiety with positive thinking and prayer.

176$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/18/2013 3:10:25 PM$Reviewer: Raynor, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I have had anxiety that was completely out of control.  I worried so much that I couldn't enjoy life because I was too busy worrying about what horrible thing might be getting ready to happen.  I would have panic attacks at night that were so bad it felt as if I was on fire, the day time panic attacks were not as bad as the ones at night, but still were bad enough.  I'm not really sure why I was hesitant to take something, but my doctor told me all this medicine would do is turn off the noise in my head.  I started out on 10 mg, then changed to 20 mg after a week.  I could tell a difference in that I wasn't worrying as much, but the anxiety was still there lurking, and still bad at night.  He increased my dosage to 40 mg and everything has been much better.  I don't feel any different except that I am not worring myself sick.  Now my worries and controllable and rational.  This medicine has made a huge positive change in my life.  As for side effects, I was very sleepy when I began taking it, but after about a month and a half it's not very bad.  I sleep well, no problem there.  I have a bit of dry mouth, but I just dring more water which is better for me anyway.  The side effects are so minimal and the medicine works great.  I only wish I would have taken my doctor's advice and started taking it earlier, it would have saved me a lot of anxiety.

501$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/21/2011 5:35:11 PM$Reviewer: Sunshine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I have had severe anxiety for over two years and have suffered with depression and PMDD. I decided after a severe anxiety attack 3 months ago to take the pills prescribed I started at 10mg for a month and saw marked improvement in my mood and a decrease in anxiety. The side effects were tolerable (dry moth and tiredness) then I went to 20mg when I saw a plateau and again it worked even better than 10mg and i saw an overall improvment but now again Im increasing to 30mg so I hope that it will be efffective to take it. I know it is scary to take that jump to take something but it has made a HUGE improvement to my life and my kids and family are happy to be around me now. I totally suggest it :)

I really like Celexa so far. I have started out on 10mg and am changing to 20mg. At first, I had some side effects of sleepiness and my mind would race. Overall, I have not had any panic attacks in the last 2 months, although I feel like I come close to the verge of one. I believe that when I increase my dosage that will help. Also, I would avoid alcoholic beverages the first month or so of taking celexa while your body is getting use to the medicine. When I drank the first month of taking the medication my side effects greatly increased.

Along with selling her house and pretty much liquidating all of her possessions. During that process, I more or less woke up every 2 hours in a panic with my heart racing. After I started with the meds, I noticed a complete turn around in less than 2 weeks. I'm now weening myself off and feel so much better after 6 months of being on it. Plus, my mother's affairs have all been taken care of and I am very happy with the overall results of the home she was placed into and the care that they provide.

If you're over stressed, talk to your doctor about possibly going on this drug. It's short term, I believe, but at least it let me sleep, so I could  deal with all of the issues and relieve the stress."

Troubles sleeping, tiredness during the day even after a nap, weight gain, diarreha, nausea, very noticeable increase in menstrual cramps, definate increase in sweating, change in appetite. When I first started taking citalopram after that first inital month my anxiety seemed to disappear. That part of the pills is very nice but being a single mother I can not handle being unable to sleep and being so darn tired ALL the time. Then after taking these for several months I have started to feel anxiety again. I take these every day and have not skipped a day. The other day I even had a panic attack. This medication is just not worth it to me. Be aware of ALL side effects when taking something. Also check out if you can take something like ibuprophren or asprin while on the medication trust me you won't want to deal with why. It is NOT fun and can be scary.

779$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/29/2010 10:18:54 PM$Reviewer: MVB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $2$2$4$"I took this medication for a year to treat anxiety/depression issues. The drug seemed to work for the first few months I was on it, but eventually the drawbacks began to outweigh the posities. The drug significantly lowered my libido. It also led to a somewhat unreal feeling of constant happiness and satisfaction.
I eventually felt that the drug wasn't really helping me with my problems. It was covering them up, ineffectively at that.
I found that talking to a therapist was the most effective way to treat my disorder, and I strongly discourage potential users from simply taking a drug to try and cope.
Many doctors are eager to overprescribe drugs and just hope that the problem will go away. It won't. Upping the dosage will not force you to treat the source of these problems.
Personally, while I think that the drug helped me get through a difficult time in my life, I don't think that it's worth losing yourself in the process.
Mental pain, like physical, is indicative that something is wrong. When we treat a physical ailment we don't just treat the symptom; we treat the cause. I feel that anxiety, depression and other emotional illnesses should be looked at in the same manner."

829$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/2/2010 11:29:20 AM$Reviewer: personintx, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"Over the past year I was under a tremendous amount of stress that ultimately manifested itself in panic attacks and insomnia. The insomnia I could handle, but the panic attacks were becoming unmanagable.  I  started on 10 mg of this drug and bumped up to 20 mg after 6 weeks.  
This drug helped me greatly.  No more panic attacks or constant anxiety.  My insomnia also has eased up.
This drug has helped me handle my stress and address my life problems with a clear head, not muddled with acute anxiety.
There are side effects such as vivid dreams and loss of appetite, but nothing that I find hard to handle.
This drug has helped me."

I've noticed I can usually skip a day or two before the anxiety starts slowly coming back so I think it would be hard for me to stop taking this drug...I'm just glad I found something that helps!  Give it time to work....

I have found, though, that different life events moderate the effects of the drug rendering it less effective.  During more stressful times in life, you may find the medications effectiveness drop, but I saw this to be expected.

I did find that the medication made me far less moody and less agitated by ""the little things.""  I am a self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive and I find it difficult to concentrate in disorganized environments or a room that is in disarray.

One last thing: After being out of country and suddenly running out of the medication (under highly stressful conditions), I experience what I could only describe as a persistent anxiety attack.  I would highly advise patients to ensure they have ample supply when traveling abroad!

My doctor tried several medications and could not lower my BP.  Because my BP was so high, I was a nervous wreck.  It was suggested I try this drug along with my BP medication.  FINALLY, my bp dropped to normal after a year of trying to lower it.  This medication has been a life saver!  It takes a few weeks to work but stick with it because it's worth it.  I never have anxiety anymore and nothing upsets me!  Best of all...my BP is NORMAL!!!  Highly recommend it!

I do experience the constant sleepiness in the mornings and for a few hours around lunch and the dreams "" never really had dreams until I started taking the pills"" but they are not bad just sleep right through them, and sometimes get the dry mouth, but no effect on the sex drive. so I think I will try it a bit longer and I will let you know if it is working any better.

1282$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$12/9/2008 10:17:41 PM$Reviewer: Anthony, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I appreciate & respect everyone's comments about Citalopram.  I too have had vivid, pleasant dreams, no nightmares.  I have had a significant decrease in libido, but I've actually been able to last longer now with my wife.  I have a great life, wife, kids but always worried about the the 'other shoe dropping' mainly with work.  This drug has taken the edge off, and I feel so much more peaceful, happy now & more comfortable with myself in social situations, more confident. I have not experienced more anger, actually the opposite.  I am only taking 10mg/day in morning (cutting pills in half).  I actually felt WORSE, more jittery, anxious when I was on 20mg (or 10mg of Celexa). I do not feel like I am on a medication. It took alot of courage for me to accept the fact that maybe I needed medical help for my anxiety.  I am not one to normaly take any medical drugs. I tried to work through it, talk with social workers. This drug helps me to take life one day at a time & enjoy it. This medication works for me.

I could always feel my heart beating in my chest so depending on my moods I could feel it pounding or skipping a beat every now and then. I also was very aggrivated by sounds in the evening. If my husband rolled over in bed I would get a shock through my body and get startled and I would be very angry about it. Last night was the first night I took citalopram, I didn't feel my pounding all night and I wasn't startled at all by small sounds throughout the night. I will review again in a month. I hope I don't get all the bad side effects. If this medication helps me after 16 years of extreme anxiety I will put up with any side effects.

I started to take it during the day and just couldn't handle it so I changed to about 8PM every night now and have no problems sleeping for the most part. I do occasionally have very interesting dreams but generally wake up feeling fine. Get a good nights rest is important I believe while taking this stuff.....Good Luck to you.

For about 10 years I've been dealing with depression and panic/anxiety order.  For years I tried everything to not have to take meds - stress management class, relaxation therapy, exercise, meditation, you name it.  Finally, I ""gave in"" and decided I couldn't fight on my own anymore.  The first week was pretty awful.  I felt drunk all the time.  Couldn't drive and had a tough time at work.  Then one day, my mind was clear!!!  Seriously clear!  Like I could actually focus.  The sense of being overwhlemed was gone.  It's been about 4 years.  Sometimes I come off it for 2-3 months just to give my boday a break (no one ever told me to do that, I just do.  Each time, the withdrawal is the same as when I first started taking it.  The dizzy drunkness.  It usually takes me just 2 months to remember why I went on it in the first place.  It's an awesome drug.  Doesn't interfere with my life at all.  I still get happy, sad, scared, excited.  I'm just able to focus so much better and take one thing at a time.  I've been married for 5 years now and will be starting a family soon.  I really don't want to have to come off while pregnant or breastfeeding.....

I am super sensitive to drugs and wanted to start slow to make sure I could tolerate it.  Side effects included loss of appetite and tight stomach for about 5 days after starting and again as I increased the dose.

Quite often, I would work myself into a panic over small things and sometimes over nothing, and my heart would pound rapidly causing my anxiety level to go even higher.  I feel that citalopram has had the effect of keeping my anxiety below the level that would trigger a rapid heartbeat.  The only side effect of any significance I have noticed is that I am often unable to climax during sex.  Other than that it has been incredible helpful.

I am much more confident in myself, and can speak up for myself, and talk with a clear mind. Before the medication I could barely hold a conversation without having an anxiety attack.

I had no side effects outside drowsiness which was fine I then took it before bed and finally I was able to sleep. I gained my appetite back and I never felt more clarity and happiness.

I felt pretty immediate results. For reasons I can't remember, I switched to different medications and tried 4 others before coming back to Celexa. Compared to Effexor (the last drug), I finally don't have the ""brain fog"" feeling anymore- and also feel more like myself!  Also the Effexor messed with my sex drive-- ugh! Thankfully Celexa is a much better drug for me overall. "

I took this pill for Severe post-partum anxiety/OCD. I stayed on it for 17 months. And it was truly the worst 17 months of my life. The worst intrusive thoughts I have ever experienced, felt like I was in a constant panic attack 24/7 where I literally felt like I was going insane, my thoughts were constant loops of irrational fears and I would do anything to try and make them stop, I thought I had something spiritually wrong with me or I was going insane, horrible derealization, lost connection with almost every person except my boyfriend, no connection with my baby, couldn't feel any of my body whatsoever except barely my feet and the back of my back, lost all faith in God, wanted to commit suicide many times. I stayed on this medication for 17 months because I thought this was just how i had ""become"" from having a baby. The doctors said it was just anxiety and they didn't want to take me off of it to ""destabilize"" me. I was afraid I would only get worse without it. It finally became too much and I told them to take me off it and put me on Prozac for OCD. I am finally weaned off after a week, day 2 without it and day 2 of a full dose of Prozac. The intensity of my thoughts have lowered and I am starting to feel my head and legs again. I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy. Celexa was a living hell for me. I hope I keep getting better."

I feel balanced and in control. I don't intend on staying on this medication forever, but right now, it has been exactly what I needed.

It took a solid 6 weeks for it to kick in, and a few months for the worst of the side effects to wear off (sweats, vivid dreams, disconnected feelings, digestion issues). After that it just seemed to keep getting better. My everyday anxiety and occasional panic attacks became very muted, and much easier to manage. This helped me stop depending on benzos for anxious ""flare ups."" Everyone around me noticed and my relationships improved. I lack the extremes in emotions, for better or worse. In the beginning, I wasn't noticing the weight gain. I actually felt like I was making better dietary choices. But I was a little more tired and I now require at least 8 hours of sleep a night or I need a nap during the day (less energy/activity). I also didn't notice the gradual decline in my sex drive. So, now that I am at about a year of taking this RX, I realize that while my anxiety and panic are managed--staving off the depression that they caused--the 20-25lbs I've steadily gained, coupled with the low sex drive is negatively affecting me, and my partner! So, I'm looking to change meds at this point. Again. I've previously taken buspirone (Buspar), and paroxetine (Paxil). Neither were as effective as citalopram."

It's hard to get adjusted to and takes time.  Give yourself time and be patient.

I started taking it because I had extreme anxiety, racing thoughts.  It was tremendously helpful for me within 2 weeks.  It was a lifesaver.  I was taking 60.  My major complaint is I gained nearly 100 pounds within a year.  I have been able to get some of the weight off.  But, the benefit, mentally, outweighed the physical for me.

Problem is, now, I want to come off.  Any SSRI is a very slow, slow, SLOOOOOOOOOOOW process of coming off because of head zaps, feelings of spaciness, just feeling ""off"", but I have faith that little, by little, I will come off.  I would go back on it in a heartbeat if those symptoms returned.

I am and was almost completely homeopathic, natural medicine.  I had tried everything before Celexa.  Nothing worked as well. So, all in all, besides the weight gain (which not everyone gets), I recommend it."

I began having trouble sleeping after the first week of starting this medication.  I only took the drug for 3 weeks but the side effects got so bad, I just stopped taking it.  I have been off the drug for about 10 days now but I am still having the heavy sweating, shivering, restlessness, and I can't sleep.

I was having a lot of anxiety problems which I could not control (started w/the death of my Dad). I was warned that I would gain weight and lose my sex drive and maybe have upset stomach. None has happened. This drug has been great for me. I do find that there are times it seems more affective than others. I have also heard that with women, anxiety can creap up on you based on changes in hormones. I am a 53 yr old female and post menopausal. This maybe is why there are times where I feel a little less under control - but this happens pretty rarely. I do not want to stay on this drug forever. I am a little nervous as to what happens when you get off of it. So far so good. It has helped a lot!

I had very bad vivid dreams but it worked.  Then one day out of the blue it just totally stopped working and had a major panic/anxiety attack.  I think it originally did it's job but things changed, not sure if it was my chemistry or the presciption itself changed.  I would say that you have your doctor keep a close eye on you and do a medication review.  I went to the doctor every 3 months and I didn't have a warning that it would no longer work.

2110$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/25/2012 7:20:21 PM$Reviewer: emmaemma, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$" I started taking Celexa about a week ago and so far I am just ""okay"". I suffer from a generally panicky and anxious mood(which is usually almost all day long) and low grade panic attacks when I have to do oral presentations(which is almost every other day). I've noticed that I do not feel as anxious as I used to; I can now eat breakfast and lunch which I was unable to do before because of my anxiety. I can say that it is a major improve over what I was experiencing before. 

 The first day I had really bad nausea(maybe or maybe not because I was anxious about taking the SSRI) and now I'm just exhausted. I yawn constantly and feel drowsy in my classes; I'm also sleeping more than I used to. But I'd rather be drowsy than hyped  up and nauseated on nervous energy. So overall - I'm hopeful about the drug. I also have had loss of libido. No depression. No suicidal thoughts.

Ive been on the 40mg for about a month and i can tell a big difference as far as the depression goes. The anxiety has lessened some. However at my next appt. i am definately going to ask about other medications due to the fact that i CAN NOT stop yawning. It is literally driving me insane. I feel as if i need a nap every few hours and with the incredibly busy lifestyle that i lead, it's just not working out for me.

2193$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/21/2011 10:37:12 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on Celexa for four years and it has saved my life.  I had horrible anxiety.  My mind worried constantly every day and I could not break the cycle.  Therapy helped control the worrying but it took me hours of soothing myself before my anxiety would start to decrease.  I was on blood pressure medication as well since my anxiety was so high.  This went on for 3 years.  Since taking Celexa, my mind no longer worries endlessly and my blood pressure is back to normal.  I have regained my life and it is a miracle.  I would highly recommend this drug.  Before I had no quality of life and now I feel very happy.  I was up to 40 mg. at one time early on but found that if I took a nap, I was down for hours.  I was sleeping very deeply.  Now that I have cut back to 20 mg. my sleep is better.  I do have some of the strange dreams, which is a side effect, but that is minimal compared to the tremendous relief that has come about in my life.

2195$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/16/2011 1:43:58 PM$Reviewer: Deafguy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$5$Took Celexa for over three years.  Side effects suck, caused more anxiety than it cured. Made me sleepy during the day and no sexual desire. Gave me tremors and weird brain freezes where I couldn't think straight.  I slowly filed the dosage down over several weeks and have finally stopped using it. I didn't experience withdrawal symptoms too bad.  New research found it caused heart problems at > 40 mg.  Never take it again.  I don't care what the doctors tell you.  These pills are poison, they may relieve your sypmtoms for a while, but when you try to get off them it's like a psychotic nightmare.  The doctors have no idea how horrible the withdrawal is from these medications.  Some people never return to normal after stopping.  Before taking any depression meds have your doctor give you several suggested ones to review before you select one. Try to find one that doesn't cause horrible withdrawal symptoms or have side effects worse than being depressed.  Good luck.

I ran into a jam & ended up running out of my Lexapro and was unable to pay the $85 co-pay for my 3 mo. supply so was put on 40 mg Celexa temporarily, as it's WAY cheaper.  

Other than feeling a bit zombiefied, it definitly keeps me calm, but I also take Xanax XR 1mg at bedtime so that may have something to do with it too.  

I've also noticed I dont have as much energy on this medicine and have a tendency to space out more than with the Lexapro. 

Had a dr. appt today and we both agreed I should get back on the Lexapro as soon as my finances permit.

Overall, the Celexa works...just makes me kinda feel like the lights are on, but nobody's home."

I talked to the psychiatrist and he prescribed Celexa. I was hypervigiliant, thought about suicide all the time, I ate constantly, and I was so anxious about everyday life I couldn't concentrate.

Started off with the half a pill for seven days. I woke up with gloom and doom thoughts, rapid heartbeat the first two days on the half pill. On the third day I woke up, calm, with a normal heartbeat. I finally felt like myself. Went on the full dose (40 mg) four days later, but I could tell it was too much. I felt dead inside, just like I did with the Paxil I took two years ago, so I went back to the 20 mg dose after two weeks. I feel a little anxiety, but nothing like it was before. I feel like I can handle life now. I do have to remind myself to drink a lot more water because dryness seems to be a minor side effect. My appetite has also decreased.

I was first placed on 5mg of Citalopram (twice a day)and 18 months later my dosage was increased to 10mg (d.i.d.) and I seriously doubt I would be alive today had it not been for Citalopram. I am now on a combination of drug therapies including Citalopram (10mg b.i.d), Buproprion XL (300 mg q.i.d.), Lorazepam (1mg q6h), and Trazedone (100mg at bedtime). I doubt I will ever return to what I consider a normal life, but I am at least able to leave my home now and go to the drug store and grocery store. I still have a great deal of trouble with social events, but that is also due to the fact that I have stage-4-COPD and am on oxygen 24-7 which has taken a huge psychological toll on me. This is not including the physical ravages that past HIV medications have had not only on my physical appearance, but my mental state as well. I was infected with HIV in July 1985, but not diagnosed until February 1986. I have suffered from severe wasting syndrome, lipidystrophy, and lipoatrophy due to the toxicity of the various medications I was on from 1986-2006.

However, recently, I have noticed that my energy levels are extreme - if I'm not staying busy, I freak out, I think maybe I need the ADHD meds again; I have absolutely no interest in sex; and I'm beginning to feel more anxious.

After 4 weeks I went back to see him and by then I was in a worse mental state than I started with! I was completely deppressed and that isnt like me at all! I told my doc that the anxiety kinda went away but I was sweating soooo much, had a headache everytime I woke up and it messed up my sleep so much. He increased my does to 40mg and thats when I quit it cold turkey. Withdrawl was terrible for about 4-7 days(too many syptoms to even bother writing) and even after that initial 4-7 days went by, I was depressed far more than I EVER had been prior and this lasted about 2 months. This drug literally turned all my emotions off and I lost alot of time because of this drug. If this even helps one person then it was worth it. God bless

I had been on the Lexapro for about 5 years before the change. My anxiety came back with a vengeance and I even developed depressive symptoms where I had none before. Impulse control went out the window. Two dosage increases later the doctor decided to try me on Cymbalta with no change, but anger control was now an additional issue. I was coming unwound! Finally went back to the doctor and insisted that she put me back on the Lexapro with a pre-authorization for the insurance company. I am gladly paying the $45/mo. co-pay...my sanity is worth it. I am currently on Lexapro 20 mg, 1 tab daily and Effexor XR 75 mg, 3 tabs daily and am finally stable with my anxiety.  "

Terrible crying episodes, no appetite, very distant from my husband and friends.  Just didn't feel like myself.  Over the last 7 years my doctor has increased my dosage from 10mg to 40mg and that has solved my issues.  I had been taking wellbutrin for a short while; that made all my problems worse than ever.

2402$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/19/2011 12:16:09 PM$Reviewer: Gary, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Depression and anxiety attacks gradually crept into my life. The last four years saw a random like up swing, first in anxiety attacks and then finally sudden and deep depression. I have been taking celexa for almost three weeks at the time of this writing. Day two I was on the treadmill watching tv and I caught myself laughing at the comedy show. My wife ran into the room and stood amazed it had been that long since she heard me laugh. My high school students even noticed that I was smiling and laughing in class. It is little things like this that show me how far I had slowly regressed over the years. I feel alive again. Social gatherings that used to be painful, due to fear of anxiety attacks, seem to have disappeared. It's like I keep waiting for the anxiety to take over, but it doesn't. So I am still adjusting to the new me. The first few days I had really bad headaches and dry mouth. Headaches are gone and I sip water, especially at night. I can't believe that little pill has changed my life in such a positive way. I thank God and my doctor every day. I don't know when the anxiety and resultant depression started. I had testicular cancer 30 years ago, maybe that was the trigger. All I know is that slowly over the last 30 years, I was ever so slowly changing for the worse. So I am learning to love life again. Take heart all of you who know what I am saying. I feel young again.

The first week was in a fog and yawned alot, but could tell right away, the medicine was helping.  Basically I had the same 'lifes problems', but did not get near as upset about them.  One common side affect for men is cannot ejaculate as easy.  For a guy this is somewhat of a benefit.  I can last a lot longer than I used to, which makes it good for my wife, but tends to tire her out. I had ED before taking and continue to take Viagra, so am not sure how this RX affects erection quality.

I've had both ever since i remember, but my social phobia got significantly worse in 9th grade. I woke up in the morning dreading the day and thinking of any excuse to give my mother not to go. During the summer i didn't leave the house or shower for 2 months and rarely ate. I read 24/7 to get my mind off depression. My mother got worried and sent me to therpy. I was diagnosed with social phobia, but kept my depression to myself. I was put on prozac for about a month. I got really hyper and woke up energized. I could not stop talking. My anxiety got better, but unfortunately my depression did not. I started self injuring and had trouble falling asleep. I've had suicidal thoughts before but i've always had a little bit of hope. One night i coudn't sleep and felt totally hopeless and started planing how i would kill myself. So i told my mom my medicine had kept me up and i needed to change it. I told my theripist that i coudn't sleep and that i felt hopeless the whole time on prozac. He told me that was impossible. Yeah, alright. They put me on celexa first on 10mg but that did nothing. They put me on 20mg and i take it at night because it makes me tired. I had no side effects. It has helped with the general feelings of anxiety. Like when i wake up in the morning i don't have to make excuses not to go to school. I can go to parties with my parents and can handle being around adults better, but once someone talks to me the anxiety lasts all day. So i'm feeling kinda bittersweet about it. I might have to up my dose or something. It hasn't helped my depression at all. I hope someone finds this helpful, haha.

I was consumed by anxiety which has been a lifelong problem since I was a child, resulting more and more in physical symptoms as I get older (frequent ""adrenaline rushes"", indigestion/IBS, chest tightness, prolonged pounding heartbeat and, recently, mild panic attacks that were interfering with my sleep and ability to function). 5 years ago at age 22, I first started taking Celexa 10mg. At the onset of my treatment I was very stressed out and nervous. I got a number of moderate side effects: heart palipatations, heart ""skipping a beat"", and one episode of very rapid heartbeat that was scary because I was not prepared for it. I stayed on the medication and within a week the side effects went away. 10mg was eventually reduced to 5mg because I found that 10mg resulted in too much of a relaxing effect (carelessness, lack of motivation). 5mg improved this considerably.  I stayed on 5mg for over a year and eventually went off the medication altogether at the direction of the doctor because my symptoms were under control. 2 yrs later, anxiety symptoms returned amidst new life changes and stress.  I went back on 5mg celexa to mitigate the physical symptoms I was having.  My latest bouts of anxiety prior to taking Celexa were very distracting and were affecting my body. I saw a cardiologist because my heart was constantly pounding, blood rushing in my head when I tried to sleep. They ruled out any physical cause so I started taking 5mg Celexa again. Have been very pleased with the results. This medication almost entirely eliminates the abnormal anxiety that I have experienced recently and at other points in my life. I am on a very low dose, which is enough for me to respond to, and I do not experience any negative side effects.  The medication does prolongue sexual performance even at this low dose (consider that to be a positive side effect not a negative one). "

After just days on celexa, I felt a marked improvement. I've been on it for about a month now, and I feel wonderful and can actually function! The only side effect I experienced was lack of libido. Additionally, I didn't know not to drink and had two cocktails...that is something you definitely do *not* want to do. Drinking while on this drug gave me panick attacks and urinary problems in that I could not urinate at all. Otherwise, I have found a drug that is great for me.

The Celexa has brought me out of that paxil ""fog"" and not be tired all the time. The side effects were Very minimal because I had already went through them when starting the Paxil (and they weren't that bad anyways--)It has helped more then the Paxil did and has less side effects. I had dry mouth but drank lots of water and chewed gum-it only lasted about 4 days. Yawned alot for about a week but then  it was gone. Cloudy (Paxil) head was gone within 2 days and now I can really put things into perspective compared to before. I feel stronger emotionally and more in control of situations. I feel human again.Have ringing in my ears still(which Doc says is unrelated--BUT I disagree--it is dealable though if this pill is going to work then I can deal !! Have been on it for 3wks. I haven't been as depressed and so far my anxiety hasn't bothered me. If anything it has made me realize I needed the help and am glad and proud of myself for getting it and the will-power to get more help if needed. Will continue to update.It is important to know that most people do NOT have bad side effects to antidepressants..They can however talk themselves into it by being so nervous of a side effect..I tried to look at it differently..I kept looking for all the good the pill is doing and making me feel rather then any thing possibly bad,which like I said was very minimum and dealable. Give it 1 1/2 wks. and see if it works for you (after all if you have the FLU you are sick that long also so take the pill and wait a week to decided. "

I was prescribed at least 4 different antidepressants which all made me feel worse.  Than I was prescribed Celexa, I've been taking it for many years, 40mg day.  If I have to go without it while I'm waiting for my prescription by day 3 all of my symptoms are starting to come back.  However the generic Citalopram is useless for me.  I must have the brand.  My insurance pays $2 toward the brand and I end up paying about $220 for a 3 month supply.  Obviously if I could take the generic I certainly would.  This also helps (not completely) to control my hotflushes as I can not take hormone therapy because of having high BP and a slight stroke in the past."

It helped my palpatations, but not enough, so now have been put on buspar for that. Had never taken any meds for anxiety/depression before.

I really feel it made me want to drink alcohol and avoid my children.  It helped calm me and not snap at my kids but at the same time I could only deal with them in small spurts.  I would retreat outside to have a drink(alcohol) and a smoke and then come in feeling more able to deal.  I went from a drink during the weekend to everyday.  I'am so glad to be off it although I did it by going cold-turkey and it's made me feel a little lightheaded and I was a bit weepy at first.  I used Prozac 20 years ago for 2 years and that worked fine.  This citalopram makes me feel like I lost about a year of my life.  I did'nt feel present in my life as a wife and mother of 3.  It's been 10 days without it and my urge to drink and smoke cigarettes are gone.  Does anyone have any similiar experience?  I'm just really puzzled and without health insurance a sit down with a doctor is not a possibility.  Hope this helps.

I do also know that depression runs in my family.  I have the type of nature that tries to deal with everything and was in denial that I needed any help of a medication.  People tell me that I have a calm demeanor and could not tell that I had been suffering inside.  I persistently dealt with it and now that I am on Celexa I definitely feel the difference.  I have been on it for about 3 years and started when I was experiencing extreme work related stress. On top of that I was experiencing menopause.  Then I lost my mother and have remained on it.  I was first put on Lexapro but it had an emotionally numbing effect on me. I have none of that with Celexa.  I am glad to find something without harsh side effects to my system.  I take it at night before I go to bed.  20 mg. Don't deny yourself the help you may need like I did for so many years.  Take care of yourself.  Talk to your doctor.

Had the yawning/drymouth/sleep issues the first 2 weeks, but since then, things have been great. No more paranoid feelings and anxiety at night. I don't wig out on my family anymore. I had to play around with they time of day to take it, because at first it would make me sleepy, so I took it at night, but then couldn't sleep, so I take it at lunch now. I highly recommend it for someone like me, mild depression and anxiety. I also have found that it's ok for me to have a few beers with friends. I even got drunk one night, but no bad side effects. This drug does help with working with difficult co-workers also, I have found myself much more pleasant with the people I can't stand at work.

For 4 of those months I continued to self-medicate with marijuana on and off (hoping that the meds would be enough to help me quit, after two weeks, I no longer was able to hold out). I took 20mg for one week and then upped to 40mg ever since. In the beginning it made me dizzy and very tired. The drowsiness never subsided which is why I switched to taking it at night and have been ever since. When I had finally been able to stop smoking marijuana 4 months later, my anxiety had subsided and my depression blew up big time. I had many crying spells. I could not concentrate. I was very lethargic, as I had been the entire time, and the celexa was not helping that. What I needed was energy. I stopped taking the pill today with instructions from my doctor to switch immediately to 150mg of Effexor (which I'm pretty nervous about...) and the withdrawal effects I had were: vertigo, sweating, crying, severe depression. Celexa works for many people. It helped me out in the beginning, as it was the first time I had ever been on an antidepressant. But it never was consistent for me, and in the end my depression became unacceptable and the Celexa was doing nothing to help.

I just got switched to lexapro today hope that works the best im sure it will tho. The side effects i have had for 1 month of taking this med is, drowsiness,out of it sensation, jitteryness,nauseas, no interest in eating what so ever, anxious due to side effects and irritability. Trouble breathing pressure in the eyes dream like state and every time i cough it makes me gag. THe side effects are not worth it for me, but meds work differently for different people.

Being optimistic on what this drug can do for me, I knew I could not come to any conclusion until I have taken the medication long enough to be sure it has to be doing something. At first (30-90) days I was up and down about how it was making me feel, but I have since noticed a significantly downward trend with my overall outlook of life and episodes of GAD and Depression. And have also had several emotional breakdowns (a first). I understand that it is not commonly recommended for people 25 and under. I was Just about to turn 25 when I was placed on it.

All of the symptoms of anxiety for which I have been taking the drug have intensified and also new disturbances have been added -- nausea, shakiness and tremors, headaches.   My md wants me to stay on it for at least 10 days to give it a fair trial; but I'm not so sure.    I don't like the way I am feeling and certainly don't want to get any worse.   I only wanted to feel better and be able to cope with stressful situation; that is the reason for starting this med.  (never been on this type of drug before -- only tranquilizer)

3117$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/4/2009 3:07:40 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$Status migrainosous was my original diagnosis with overwhelming stress as the primary factor. The Celexa was prescribed to help me get the repeated anxiety under control. As it was very effective, the Celexa really calmed me down to the point where I was to take every other night and now I'm not supposed to take it anymore. I took Celexa for 3 months and am now three days off the drug. I can feel the difference the Celexa made with the treatment of the debilitating migraines. I did suffer with low libido but all SSRI's have this side effect and that was something I could temporarily live with, as long as I didn't have to stay on the medication too long. The decreased dosage to every other day helped with this side effect only a little. Regardless, the Celexa was very effective in the treatment of my anxiety portion of status migrainosous. However when you come off Celexa (like it says), you will have headaches until your body re-adjusts to life without Celexa. I hope I re-adjust soon. Although the anxiety has been reduced with the help of Celexa and stress counseling, the migraines I took it for have come back in force. Not good! My doctor was trying to get me down to 8 migraines a month; I've taken my migraine medicine now 4 times in 3 days. To let you know, however, status migrainosous is very rare and most migraine sufferers will not have to use this product.

I guess I have gotten use to them. Which were dry mouth and sweating when I sleep. Otherwise I like it.

While on celexa I felt numb and very much unlike myself. I was on anti-anxiety meds for one year and decided to go off them due my complete lack of interest in sex and didn't want to deal with what I was experiencing for the rest of my life. I kept thinking there has to be a better way and I tapered off over a 4 week period. Getting off celexa was one of the worst exp. of my life. I had headaches, brain zaps, I was sick to my stomach, nauseous all the time and had horrible mood swings for two full months. About three months after I stopped I had a horrible emotional break down. I was at my wits end and hit the internet to research natural ways to calm me down. After trying 5-htp (which helped a little) my boyfriend mentioned magnesium deficiency. I did a little research on the symptoms and found that all my symptoms pointed towards this. Muscle tension, anxiety and horrible obsessive thoughts, insomnia, etc. After I did a little research on which brand of mag. to buy, I decided on ""Slow Mag"". I took 4 tabs a day, two in the morning on an empty stomach and two in the evening on an empty stomach. I felt more relaxed and calm within a few hours of taking my first dose; my muscle tension seemed to just melt away. I've been taking slow mag everyday for a few weeks now and I have not felt this good in years! All symtomps I mentioned above are GONE!!! I urge everyone to please, please try mag first before giving in to the drugs our doctors push on us. Magnesium test are rarely able to detect a deficiency, so just give it a try and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! There is a large majority of people with this deficiency and don't know it. If you decide to give mag a try, please research brands and make sure you buy a quality supplement that includes calcium. I want to help as many people as I can, you don’t have to be a zombie!

Over the last year I have had severe depression; sad, crying for no reason, just unhappy almost all of the time. I have tried everything. The doctor had me on Cymbalta for the depression and the Celexa for the overall anxiety. The doctor has been migrating me from Cymbalta to Wellbutrin. I am presently on 80mg of the Celexa. I take one pill in the morning and one in the evening.  I did this because I was having severe afternoon headaches by taking all 80mgs in the AM. I still have occasional headaches though.

I see a common thread in reading the reviews that insomnia is a side effect.
Amen to that. I have tried Lunesta, Advil PM, Tylenol PM, Benadryl and supplementing these with Melatonin and it is like I have taken nothing at all for sleep. I have mornings where I can't get up and I have to sleep in because of the insomnia. Anyone have any ideas?

I still experience drops in mental functioning and issues with sensory filters, as well as general anxiety and strong depression and lack of energy. During the first weeks, I experienced slight nausea, headaches, and tingling in my arms and face, which was not that bad. Each increase of dose was terrible and temporarily worsened for a few days the  symptoms I already had including heightened anxiety, shakiness, insomnia, sensory overload, falling, mental drops in functioning, and fear. I am glad however, that I took this medicine since it has helped with anxiety.

When it wasn't covered by my insurance, I switched to Celexa (citalopram). Worked well for me, but made me feel like a ""drone"" sometimes - almost too leveled out. Also completely lost sex drive. Decided that I wanted to stop meds in preparation for another pregnancy and also b/c I really don't want to be on them. I stopped cold turkey (after taking 40 mg) and it is STUPID! Do not do it! I would suggest tapering off for sure. I have had migraines, shakiness, tingling hands, dizziness, insomnia and anxiety attacks. WAY worse symptoms than before I started. I have started taking half my dose now after 2 weeks of hell, and I'm hoping to gradually taper off."

I have suffered with serious anxiety issues since my childhood. The last few years I've had financial problems and extended family problems.  After giving birth, I suffered from severe anxiety, horrific dreams, and even worse panic attacks than I did previously.  I had the opposite of ""baby blues,"" because I didn't want to put my baby down even to have a meal.  I lost 20 lbs. due to depression.  Celexa has really helped with evening out my feelings and moods.  The biggest problem is I don't sleep well at night.  I take it before bedtime.  Sex life is a little better, because I feel better about myself.  Hope this helps someone out there."

Went to my family dr. who put me on Celexa.  Have had prozac in past with no side effects. Questioned why Celexa,   was told this is better for anxiety. Was on Celexa for 12 days and everyday I became increasingly sicker. Told my doctor and was told these were side effects. Went to a different doc & therapist and both told me I had Serotonin syndrome.(can be fatal)  BE CAREFUL of this drug. My Symptoms were: Increased anxiety, hot flash that started at my lower abdomin and went up to my chin, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure(never had high blood pressure b/4), severe nausea, loss of appetite(couldn't even look at food.(lost 12 lbs in 2 weeks) muscle spasms, couldn't sleep and when tried to sleep the slightest noise made me jump out of my skin. Low grade fever 99.7, massive headache. By day 12 extreme dizziness and couldn't stand up due to weakness and balance loss. It took my body 8 days after stopping Celexa to return to almost normal. After this experience I will try to make it through anxiety without any meds.

Please if you feel something isn't right with what's going on in your body listen to yourself and get a second opinion. "

My life just turned upside down, I left a good job for a bad job, took a cut in pay, family driving me crazy, feelings of not being good enough.  I am a single mom, work full time and attend school. The stress of it all was causing awful painc attacks.  I finally went to my Dr, and it was almost embarrassing.  At first I was sick to my stomach and couldn't really eat anything without wanting to vomit.  Dizzy, tired, all the time.  I decided to only take 1/2 a pill for a few weeks, then gradually to the whole pill.  Now I am adjusted.  I did stop taking it suddenly, thinking I was pregnant, but I do not recommend doing that!  I have been all emotional, and its like the side effects of coming off are worse than when I began to take it.  Its probably why I thought I was prego.  In all, I didn't think it would make a difference, but it has.  If you are unsure like I was, trust me, it helps.  Everyone around me can feel the difference as well.

It fluctuates from anxiety, to depression, to flu-like/auto-immune symptoms, and so I'm being treated with Celexa. It's made subtle differences, but I'm still hopeless as all get out.

Not to mention that I've been extremely sensitive to any dose change in this drug, up, down (turns into sideways, back-ways, makes me disoriented and irritable)"

I think clearly, No panic attacks, more social, relaxed, no trouble sleeping, more interactive and a sense of well being. 
If you're in a fog, take something else."

I do have to say that myself & a co-worker who was also taking Celexa gained 10-15 pounds in approx 2 months time. I liked Celexa it cause it made me feel a lot calmer and happier with life but if I'm overweight I'm going to be unhappy anyways. It's a 'darned if you do & darned if you don't' with Celexa. "
