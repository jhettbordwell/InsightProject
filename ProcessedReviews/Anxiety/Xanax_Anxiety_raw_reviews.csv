The security of knowing you have it with you helps  me greatly. Just wish it kicked in sooner. I average using 1/2 of .5 mg 6 or 7 times a year. My Dr. says if I need it daily, he must prescribe another rx so as not to risk addiction. Don't understand how some say that they take it daily for 20 years or more."

Exposer therapy (getting out)helped while trying to reduce dependancy. Get off it little by little and do things outside or public areas,exercise etc... while reducing dosage. More pills and you'll soon need it to go to the mail box.

172$Anxious$1/17/2013 2:57:24 PM$Reviewer: butterfly213, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on this med for a many years now and it has successfully treated my anxiety & panic attacks very thoroughly.  I have missed a dose a time or two, & my body definitely tells me so.  I get knots in my stomach & every muscle in my body feels as if they have contracted so much they are ready to tear. Worry overwhelms me & gradually increases, which turns into a panic attack. I absolutely could not live without this medication(with the exception during my pregnancy, when I believe my hormones took over when & where needed)! I also contribute it to obliterating my symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. It has truly saved my life.
176$Anxious$1/14/2013 12:26:02 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$About a year after my husband died, I was having trouble with being anxious all the time.  My doctor prescribed Alprazolam for me to take as needed.  The prescription is .25 mg 1-3 times daily, however I have never taken more than 1 pill in a day.  It enables me to deal with stressful situations without feeling like I am tied in knots.  I have elderly parents that I care for and grown children who need help with their families so I am constantly doing for others.  This helps me deal with that.

286$Anxious$7/29/2011 4:48:34 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$5$I was taking this medication on and off for about a year for anxiety, and suggested by my rheumatologist to help me sleep for my Fibromyalgia. My anxiety was very mild when I started this medication, but I noticed after taking this medication, my anxiety worsened to the point where I could not funtion. I would panic while driving, and also panic at work and in most social situations. I also became afraid of being alone. I knew this was not normal, and my doctor and I knew that the medication was having an adverse effect on me. Several physicans and a therapist told me that they would not consider Alprazolam to be a recommended daily treatment for anxiety.. it does work, and it can be part of a treatment plan, although it's more of a med for when you actually have the anxiety attack. I am happy that it works for some and it has changed people's lives, but afraid for the people it has caused issues for. I am very grateful that I did not experience and withdrawl symptoms, and I hope for nothing but the best for those of you that have or will struggle with them. Everybody reacts to medications differently, and what works for some may not work for others, but always do what's best for you, and check with your doctor. Take Care!

This medication can become addictive and is not meant for long term use.  This stuff is a great boost on days that are particularly terrible.

It does give you a slight euphoric sensation that typically makes me pretty drowsy.  That would be my biggest negative on this stuff, the drowsiness.  Caffeine tends to negate the calming effects of the medicine, so I don't recommend trying to combat the drowsiness with coffee or energy drinks."

If I encounter extreme stress I can take one .5mg tablet and feel so much more relaxed.  With the .25mg, I didn't notice any help, but the higher dosage does work.  I would just recommend to only take in particular situations that can be very stressful.  Do not take with alcohol and do not take unless absolutely needed.

This dose works very well for me, I do not feel the need to increase my dose. My doctor retired and my new doctor said they are to take all of their patients off of this drug. I am seeking a second opinion. It works and I never have asked for an increase in the dose so I do not see why they would want to take me off of it. Some days I don't even take my second dose (about 2 days out of 7).This is a good treatment for nervious tension.I will see my new doctor today, so we will see what he thinks.
515$Anxious$5/26/2009 7:02:55 PM$Reviewer: Jumpy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$I never thought of myself as anxious, and I didn't think I had anxious thoughts, but all the symptoms were there.  I was jittery, tired a lot, clenching my teeth often, neck pain, short tempered.  I also never felt depressed, so I didn't really believe it was a mental issue.  I tried all the SNRI's and they did absolutely nothing.  I tried Alprazolam but due to it's short half life I had to take it three times a day which was a pain and made me feel like I was on a mood roller coaster.  I am now on the extended release 3mg a day.  It has pretty much eliminated all the symptoms except the constant need for a nap.  I also notice my short term memory and attention span suffer.  I am very concerned about what I have read about long term use and withdrawal symptoms.  I have been taking it about two months, and if I forget to take even one day's pill, I get so jittery that I cannot keep my eyes closed.  I cannot stop talking, and cannot keep one thought in my head for more than a few seconds. I get horrible mood swings.  So the withdrawal and addiction symptoms are something that concern me greatly.  Much worse than before taking it.

I'm sure if your here you already know about anxiety. Skipped school, horrible insomnia, and I also have a visual disorder from previous illicit drug use that is made worse by anxiety.

Some days, the anxiety would get so bad I really felt crazy. I had to break down what every person I saw look at me was thinking by their expressions. Much worse was how exaggerated/unrealistic it was, and how it didn't really matter anyways.

The doctor was a little reluctant to give me the medication (I felt like), admitting being a previous drug abuser. She did though, thankfully. I told her I only wanted the drugs on a as needed basis. I was against SSRI's or MAOI's because I've heard from people that it's made many worse, and some suicidal.

Not that it helps I am a big person and asked for a more moderate dose of 2 mg after a couple weeks.

So far so good. There are weeks that I need to take it everyday, and then I'll be fine for a month or so and not even think about taking any.

The anxiety is a funny thing though, feeling as if I don't really deserve them. I break it down into: What is the point at which I need medication? Anxiety can not kill you. But neither can a headache, what point do I ask for help? Probably the point at which I am not sleeping, or going to school, and my relationships are hurting because of it. But I constantly try to talk myself down for it.

But the medication helps me relax a good deal. In the initial few weeks I took it, I almost had a panic attack just from the anxiety of take the pill itself.

I have been addicted to drugs before, and personally am a strong willed person. The doctor told me she didn't want me to get addicted. Withdraw from alprazolam can be fatal. Literally. But so far so good. No urge to use the drug when not needed at all.

That happens to be a side effect of my visual disorder (HPPD). I have built a fear of pycho-altering chemicals. So no abuse."

Tightness in the chest, worry, shakiness, etc....I am able to deal with the symptoms during the day, but at night I usually have to take .5-1mg in order to sleep.  Xanax works really quick for me and within 20 minutes I usually feel like I'm floating!  It last pretty long and to be honest with I still play indoor soccer and regular soccer during the week.  My only question or concern is that sometimes when I don't take it at night, it's very hard to fall asleep!  I was up to 6am the other morning because my mind wouldn't shut down.  Other than that, this drug has worked well.  Very good for traveling in planes and for public situations that might make you nervous.  I just hate having to rely on pills to be normal.  I wish there was some natural remedies that worked for me.  Best of luck to you all with your conditions!  God bless!

As a Navy medic we used these med's which in most cases alleviated (permanently) all symptoms. Xanax was developed and marketed as a non addicting form of valium which is. In my experience I can now alleviate the pain of severe anxiety every morning. It may be psychologically addicting for some but that's it!

Without it, I would have been dead from extreme panic attacks, anxieties, nerves, including depression!!!
I DO NOT have an addictive personality, so taking this medication over a long period of time is not a problem... I have had to stop taking this med a few times in the past, and I've experienced no life threatening issues!  I do NOT recommend (as with any medication to stop taking it ""suddenly"" -that can negatively affect your health; mind & body)! Possibly creating extensive, serious side effects! DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS OR ANY SAME TYPE MEDICATION ""ONE DAY"" COMPLETELY!!! You must have your Dr. wean you off the medication over a good amount of time (months)!!! 
Overall, ""I'm still here & alive thanks to Xanax/Alprazolam,"" due to terrible, ""life threatening"" Anxieties, Panic Attacks, adding to depression from these attacks/nerves, etc., I've had since a late teenager after my special Grandfather passed on (first death I ever experienced,) and kids at school harassing me because I was a shy, good student!! After beginning this med I began working at my first job in a large, high profile, corporation!! Succeeding from a Marketing Assistant to the highest upper Management job/position in the Corporation!!! My anxieties/attacks were no longer controlling my life or rarely in my life any longer!  Thanks to Xanax/Alprazolam!!!
I'm VERY disappointed to now see more & more health insurance companies ""Not Covering"" this ""life saving & inexpensive"" medication anymore!!!??? For one, I just found out in 2013 Blue Cross ""PPO"" is NO LONGER COVERING XANAX/ALPRAZOLAM!?!?!?!?!  I'm disgusted with Blue Cross in their ""detrimental decision"" which will cause illnesses, some life threatening, to their customers & doctor's patients who can't afford another ADDED INSURANCE (non insurance covered expense) THAT WE PAY FOR IN OUR MONTHLY PREMIUMS ALREADY!!!!  I'm looking into canceling my BLUE CROSS ""deadly"" insurance!!:("

I take only as needed and not on a regular schedule. I suffer with severe depression and anxiety since the loss of my marriage of 32 years about 5 1/2 years ago. I only take the alprazolam when I get anxious and that is usually when I'm reminded of things about my marriage and my children. If one 0.5 mg tab doesn't work I will take two and I'm allowed to take up to 6 tabs per day. I usually don't come near to that amount and do not use it every day. My doctor is very supportive and helpful and is satisfied with my way of using the drug even though it's not on a regular schedule. It does help me sleep when take at bedtime. Overall I am very satisfied with it and when the anxiety gets bad I thank God that I have it because nothing else gives me relief like alprazolam.

I have had chronic trouble sleeping for a long time, and had been telling my doc about my general anxieties. My dr. put me on .25mg of Alprazolam,nightly.  I've noticed that it REALLY helps me sleep the entire night-usually I'd have a hard time falling asleep/staying alseep.  I've been taking it for 2 months, with the exception of 1 day. When not on it, I tossed/turned instead of sleeping, and was a mess the next day-couldn't work.  This med relaxes me/helps me fall asleep & sleep all night.  Because I've only been on it for 2 mos, I am having some side effects-I am drowsy in the am; I'm noticing that I sleep about 9hrs/night, & still sleepy upon waking. I'm more tired through the day, and sometimes I don't want to do anything at all.  I do think about death; not suicide, but just different ways of dying. Gas, extreme thirst, confusion, dizziness, menstrual changes are the other effects I've been having.  But the flip side of this is that I sleep through the night-a good thing. I wonder if these effects will go away after I've been taking it for longer? Dr's had me on antidepressants a few yrs back, but it was only for a couple of mos @ a time, never long enough to determine their effectiveness. This is the 1st time in 3 yrs I've been on anything.  Overall, this drug helps me cope with the situations in my life.

I have always,since childhood, had anxiety,overwhelming moments that basically kept me from being able to get control of myself to calm down and focus.That which made me angry,quick to just lose self control on anyone anywhere. this medication was the best thing that basically ever helped me to be able to stop,think, and react as a ""normal"" person does.One crucial warning to everyone-It is not a miracle cure.Please only take as prescribed,NO MORE.!! If you take to many even a few times and you end up going completely without it can and WILL and DID cause seizures. I was driving when it happened to me.It wasn't just one seizure it was several. I did not kill or hurt anyone except for breaking my own back.Please be careful on this and all medications.Lesson learned-follow directions and take ONLY as your doctor prescribes.And DO NOT stop taking all at once. Let your Dr. take you off slowly. It is safer."

Xanax was a blessing. I was clear headed, not clouded or confused. It gave me my confidence back for work. However-there are drawbacks. This is VERY addictive. I'm on 1mg x4per day. But there are occasions (like most of you) you take more, some MUCH more. Those cause complete black outs. I remember nothing of what I was doing, even eating out with family and watching a movie. And withdrawls are brutal-NO cold turkey. Work with your doctor to wean off. I still take-with caution and control because they are the only ones that help me control my life and stay focused. Main word there-focused. But it's a fine line of wanting to take just to prevent an attack and just wanting to relax. Even if you think you are controlled be advised. But used properly it has brought my life back to me.

Only use it at the onset of high anxiety or you WILL become addicted and you will suffer withdrawls without it. this is also one of the most effective and fastest acting anti anxiety meds which will increase liklyhood of dependancy. either use it properly or suffer emensly, your choice. and the ""three times daily as needed for anxiety"" means AS NEEDED not every single time you wake up, in the after noon, and at night.

So I asked my doctor to prescribe the generic XR version, 1 mg. On the first day, I felt great!!! The drug worked wondered stablizing my panic/anxiety attacks (which are far and few between). I'm also taking a colon cleanser to counteract weight gain. After weighing myself this evening, the scale read 4 addtional pounds from my last weigh in which was yesterday morning. I've consumed healthy foods ALL DAY so I don't understand why I'm experiencing such a tremendous weight gain. I'm going to give Xanax XR a week. If my weight continues to get out of control despite my efforts to maintain a managable diet, I'm going to request my doctor to switch me back to the regular Xanax.

29$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/5/2016 4:47:10 PM$Reviewer: Alicia, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I started with alprazolam .5 ER a week ago,and I cannot express enough the tremendous difference between the ER and regular medication. The effectiveness of extended-release is crucial to battle generalized anxiety, because it's something that lasts ALL DAY; not just an hour or so. I had previously suffered my day-to-day routine at work and basically kept my head down and avoided eye contact- even with my family. Now, in the past week I have noticed my behavior change drastically in the sense that I'm not fearful to walk down a hallway, be in a crowded store,sit at a red light with other cars; and the list goes on. I went shopping with my boyfriend the past weekend and was amazed when I caught myself joking around with two women behind us in line and then another woman in the parking lot.(Both conversations that I actually initiated) That spirit has been gone for years now and is finally coming back. I don't feel angry anymore and most importantly (to me at least) I don't feel that overly calm- almost numb feeling from taking a regular alprazolam. I couldn't be happier or recommend this medication enough for generalized anxiety!

I ""fired"" her and found another doctor (LNP) who I really liked.  After I got insurance I had to find another doctor because my insurance will not pay for a nurse practitioner.  The doctor I have now isn't a fan of alprozolam either and wants me to come off of it, but I am very strongly against it.  It has kept me functioning and being able to actually live life.

As for the lady that her insurance stopped paying for it, it is a relatively inexpensive medicine. Although I use my local pharmacy which is around 22 dollars without insurance I believe it is a medicine that is involved with alot of the 4 dollar programs that exist in the area that I live in. Wal-Mart has the program and they are nation wide. I would look into that.

You do have to respect this drug. It also helps you sleep which can cause addiction. I take it ""as needed"" up to 2 tabs a day. Usually I don't need a full tab so I split them. They will put you to sleep very quickly. I once took a Klondike to eat in bed and woke up with the Klondike melted all over me in the morning. Again, sometimes when I  use it for sleep, it gets to where I lay awake for long periods of time on nights I don't use it. Thus, I take a couple of days off. Be careful and use caution. "

I was on it for 6 years with no problems except it had to be increased.  After being off for 4 months, my doctor and I realized I needed to be back on something for anxiety.

I started having attacks while sleeping, wake up, tell my wife I loved her and start looking for the Light they talk about when your dying. A panic attack makes me absolutely sure I'm dying.I had numerous people tell me I was having panic attacks,I mentioned this to every doctor I saw and they said no. I was sent to see a stomach specialist, since they were clueless. My wife called the new Dr. to talk to him he looked at my medical records that had been faxed to him, called my wife back a little ticked and told her that I was having major panic attacks and called in Xanax. I had taken over 15 different medications prescribed to fix all the different conditions I had been diagnosed with. The Dr told me that the meds. had been making my condition worse,to get a lawyer and he would actually go to court with me since he was tired of all the patients he got that were misdiagnosed and over medicated, I had never had a doctor say something like that, but he was as I found out a real Dr., not a pill pusher for the drug Co's.whose favorite show is Dr House. I was not told about the serious withdrawals of Xanax,nor how many things can cause Xanax not to work.I think breathing filtered air has the least side effects, slightly ahead of mountain spring water. ALSO BEWARE If you take narcotic pain meds. for chronic pain daily and Xanax,around 50% of people who go through sudden withdrawal from both at once die. Oh yeah, great to know Doc. I had to find on the Net. I had an operation that left me permanently disabled and in constant pain. I have to temporarily put up with a Dr who thinks most people are just there for the drugs. Unless there wealthy movie stars who get Oxycontin for a paper cut and Xanax to help them sleep after they smoke crack. My attitude reflects, a botched operation, a lying Dr, and a life time of pain. I doubt this will be posted.

When I took it, the heaviness went away and I didnt get any side effects. My daughter passed away shortly after and I had trouble sleeping. I take one only at night when Im thinking too much and it politely puts me asleep and I get great rest. I dont take it every nite or during the day. But Im glad to have read all the positive and negative things about this drug. Drugs do have a different effect on each person, but they are prescribed for different reasons. Glad to have read some of the side effects, most helpful to me. I keep a thirty day prescription for several months. Take only as I need it. Good luck to all of you who really have severe issues and Gods Blessings to you all.

I take 1 mg 4xs daily with 10 mg of buspar 2xs daily. i know xanax can be addictive but i would be crawling out of my skin without it. My personal and professional relationships have improved greatly. instead of being overwhelmed and obsessed with my own problems i can now care about others. Before trying this I tried 4 different antidepressents and had horrible side effects from all of them. I lost two jobs due to the antidepressents. They caused everything from irrational actions and thoughts to an almost""zombie"" like existence. The possibility of being adddicted to this is a small price to pay for how much my life has changed for the better.I have grown a tolerance to xanax which is why my doctor added the buspar. so far so good. I've been taking the buspar for about 3 months now. it take about 6 weeks to take full effect.sometimes i get a bit of drowsiness after i take the buspar but it goes away within about 20 min. it just makes the xanax more effective for me. This is a combo that works for me wonderfully but everyone is different. It took about six months of trial and error before my doc and i found what works for me. "

I just want to say how sorry I feel when I went to my doctor 6 months ago and agreed to SWITCH my MEDS. I took ATIVAN for about 2 years, my doctor thought it'd be ""BEST"" to switch because I kept having episodes (panic attacks), I had them maybe once a month or so because I am taking LEXAPRO which saved my life. So I AGREED!! WoW, it's soooo addicting and stays in your body for about 38 hours unlike ATIVAN (only 18 hrs), now I have had some withdrawal symptoms (they are nasty) Just like withdrawing from VICODIN..(that's how I can describe it, my friend told me that's how it feels)
Anyway, I am an ultrasongrapher so I am in a med. field and TRUST me people, DON'T TAKE or STOP AS SOON AS YOU PHYSICALLY CAN!!!!! I BET THIS IS THE BEST ADVICE A PERSON ON THIS SITE CAN GIVE YOU.
TO ALL, 
BE HEALTHY AND SAFE

I will say for people who get full on panic attacks it is gold in a pill form. I used to hyperventilate to the point of almost passing out. But I stopped having panic attacks and I'm 26 now and had them from roughly age 22-23 then a few more throughout the years. But let's say I take it for general aniexty-a family issue arrises-etc it usually-no matter what strenght causes me to black out in a sense. I most often can't recolect any activity I do after taking 1mg of xanax. So I personally only realy keep it on hand for full on panic attacks and when I know I'll be home safe. But I want to warn ne1 who reads this -I know over a dozen people my age who have stolen from me for these pills. Their full on junkies with xanax. It's sad. It's just never done it like that to me-probaly bc I literally and medically needed it. So don't start if addiction runs in your family. Thanks

I've used it for over ten years (went thru some bad medical and financial times then and had to take 2mg about 5 times a day). About 5 or 6 years ago I started taking 1/2 dose only when necessarry and now just use it 6 or 7 times a month. I did experience some withdrawal when I cut the dosage, but not anything severe. I don't recommend it for addictive personality types, but when used sparingly it works for me.

471$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/17/2009 3:49:16 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$5$"It REALLY helps as a ""right now"" fix for my panic attacks - which is what is needed in the midst of one.  I started off taking it here-and-there when the panic attacks started, but then I started taking it on a daily basis about 10 months ago - almost to prevent any anxiousness and that seemed helpful and like it was a smart thing to do (my doctor prescribed me 1mg 3xday if necessary -- and I was just taking 1mg so I didn't think I was going overboard with it).  And up until a month or so ago, I was taking it daily.  HOWEVER - I started to realize that I have been gaining weight (about 15lbs in the last 8-10 months), which has added to my problems with depression/anxiety.  So I started taking less and less.  I get pretty annoying headaches, and have had some trouble sleeping at night.  I don't necessarily feel addicted to it - but I'm to the point where I've been taking this ""quick fix"" drug daily and relying on it to solve my problems.  But really - from what I've read about it - it's not a good drug to stay on for a long period of time, so I think it's good to have on hand for the panic attacks, but I wouldn't get into the habit of taking it daily - it's pretty annoying to stop taking."

I NEVER slept more than 45 minutes and I had nightmares the whole time, my whole body shook ALL the time like I was having convulsions... I could go on with this forever. My doctor put me on 40 mg (<~?) a day as well as one 1mgof xanax 4 times a day. I have never felt better in my life. I don't shake, sweat, pant, or ""freak out"" anymore.

I was prescibed Alprazolam. I have been taking it for almost a year and my body have slowly built a dependence. I started at .5 mg and now up to almost 4mg.  Now if I don't take it I suffer from withdrawal. I have lost interest in mostly everything. I wake up early feeling like I want to jump out of my skin. Sometimes I have horrible nightmares. Days seem just to mesh. I have family support and my doctor is trying to slowly ween me off but it doesnt seem to help. I find myself thinking and rationalizing constantly about everything. I have trouble getting thoughts out verbally without studdering. I wonder if my doctor really understands what this drug does long term. It helped in the beginning but now its my new anxiety. I suggest before you use this drug to make sure its monitored very carefully. The side effects are horrible if you reduce it just a small amount (at least in my case). I wish I had taken another type of treatment non-drug related! I hope this helps anyone so they dont fall into the same trap this drug puts you in long term.

It was so bad that I couldn't work, I refused to answer the phone, I refused to read email, and I (Still) refuse to open the mail because anything negative would spiral me down the panic/guilt attack cycle. It was so bad that A DREAM would set it off and I would wake up crying and not be able to get back to sleep…

I am on the medications that I can get for free through AID programs through the manufacturer but I HAD to go to the doctor and she put me on Alprazolam 0.5mg (the round, peach kind of pill) and it has saved my life!

I take half a pill when I get overwhelmed at work and if the dream-triggers return, half before bed as well.

I get 15 pills at a time with 1 refill and it takes me 6 months to go through all of them because I only take them as a last resort so I don’t get a tolerance for them and they will stop working and to make sure I don’t get a dependence issue with them as well…

I know there is no such thing as a “Magic Pill” to cure my anxiety and depression but this is the closest thing I have ever found.

I would probably be dead if it were not for my doctor prescribing me this medication.

I have had only 2 side effects. I periodically get forgetful if I take a full pill in a 24 hour period and it makes me sleepy but an extra cup of tea and some thumping music in the background usually pulls me through it…

When I experience anxiety at night, it does not force me asleep by knocking me out like other sleep aids, but rather allows me to relax to the point where I can fall asleep instead of being kept awake worring and suffering from anxiety. As long as you take it as directed, I would reccomend this drug to others. I tried lexapro for awhile, but it did not work at all for me.  I am very satified and would reccomend this drug to anyone suffering from anxiety or panic attacks.

So much so that it pretty much took over my life to the point where I didn't want to go anywhere or be around anyone.  I've been on this for 10 years now and couldn't be happier.  If it means that I have to take this 4 times a day for the rest of my life, I'll do so because it makes me feel so at ease.  For me, the benefits outweigh the risks.  I tried antidepressants in the past, but I honestly felt more anxious and had a flat affect for what seemed like all the time.  They made me feel down and out, so I stopped taking them.

If I notice an attack it starts to go away within a few minutes much better than hours.. Effected by lowered libido, weight gain and very mild drowsiness

I just take one when I feel like I am going to feel anxiety and it works great! I only take when I need it so a 30 day supply can last quite a while. I dont feel like it is habit forming if you only take as you need it. It has helped me get my social life back! It also seems to help with some stomach problems I was having. 
657$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/7/2008 10:51:48 AM$Reviewer: JT, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$Took Xanax for about 6 months and let me tell you in my experience absulutely do NOT drink alcohol while on this med.   I was taking 3-.5mg day and I drank once while Xanax and it almost  killed me.   My wife could not find a pulse and was close to calling 911 before she could get me back.    Never again.  I do not take Xanax any longer nor do I drink either so now I am on Ativan.  Much better in my case.  
659$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/5/2008 3:37:55 AM$Reviewer: Kohtzy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Anxiety can be such a horrible feeling!! It is a fairly new experience (w/in the last year) for me brought on (I think) by a very stressful job. Was just recently prescribed Alprazolam for stress related chest pains(tests ruled out heart issues), feelings of panic at times, and BP pushed higher by stress.  I take .5 as needed and have not noticed any dependance effects or side effects.  I am able to function well at work and notice that I don't feel drugged, just not as overly worried or stressed about things like usual.  Some days I will need to take all 3 pills (while bp meds are being adjusted and i'm worried about high bp), others only 1 at night or not at all.  I will be careful of dependancy now though, after reading the other posts.  All in all, I would highly recommend based on my experience.  I'm the type who would rather not take a pill, but in this case I am so glad I did...

669$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/10/2008 5:55:43 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I was diagnosed with anxiety after years of therapy by a highly qualifed Dr. I have at least 5 of the symptons shown. I was on numerous meds while in therapy for anxiety & depression but never alprazolam the therapist was afraid of addiction. My primary Dr. prescribed .5 mg at night years ago and it was the 1st time I was able to easily fall asleep. I have never had to increase that amount at night. After continual anxiety related problems my primary recommended this drug on a daily basis of 3mg XR. I discussed my fear of addiction and the Dr. stated there were numerous patients who never had to increase their dose and others over time who needed it increased to have the same effect.Do to my fear of addiction I still do not take the recommended dose but after reading all the reviews and realizing I still do not lead a normal life due to anxiety in many of its forms,I am going to increase my dosage to 2mg and if need be the recommended dosage of 3mg daily.  If you suffer from numerous causes of anxiety, have been through therapy and tried numerous other meds, I would highly  recommend this drug.  I only hope due to insurance or change in doctors that I will never have to go through withdrawl nor have to increase my dosage.

Usually 1/2 pill does the trick.  I take it when I know am going into uncomfortable situation and can sometimes head off panic before it starts.  Has worked wonders for me.
694$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$12/1/2007 5:17:52 AM$Reviewer: smokie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Highly recommended for anxiety disorder, especially in social settings. Works fast, has a very mild sedative effect in small dose (compared to Diazepam) and is fast relief from muscle or neurological spasms associated with multiple sclerosis. Only problem is it can be very easy to become dependent and it was hard to find a doctor to help taper off. In addition, missing a dose or stopping the medication after prolonged use can cause severe insomnia and anxiety worse than before being prescribed. Use with caution.

It helps within a few minutes and makes a huge difference and it has made my life so much easier knowing I have it with me so I can relax instead of panic and get sick.
