Despite it taking a couple of hours to really set in, it still works to help with my anxiety.
9$Anxiousness associated with Depression$7/11/2017 10:40:15 PM$Reviewer: coreyjroth, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$After having been on zoloft for almost 3 years with excellent results, it pooped out on me and stopped working. My doctor decided to first max out my zoloft dosage to see if that would help. It somewhat did, but not to out satisfaction and it made me very sedated. We then decided to switch me to prozac as it is the most stimulating and i was looking for something to give me energy. Over several weeks, i weened myself off of the 200mg a day zoloft (down 50mg a week) and up to 60mg proac (20 mg per week until 60mg). The transition period was tough. I was unable to distinguish if the side effects were from discontinuing the zoloft or beginning the proac. By the time I stopped taking the zoloft, I was on 60mg prozac/day. I was irritable, anxious, and unable to have a full night's sleep. I would wake up every 1-2 hours. I also have ativan to take when needed and it surely helped with the sleeping and daily panic attacks. after several weeks, I thought that the prozac was beginning to work. However, I was wrong. I had severe side effects that would not go away. Mainly, joint pain, irritability, lack of motivation and concentration. I also noticed bruises on the inside of my thighs that came out of nowhere. I went back to my doctor and we lowered my dose to 40mg/day. a week later, after having the same side effects on top of fever, night sweats, and just did not feel right. I called my doc and she recommended i go to the ER to rule out neuroleptic malignant sydrome (later found out that is caused by antipsychotics, NOT antidepressants). we decided to end the prozac as it was clearly not working right with my body. I am beginning 10mg of lexapro tomorrow and am trying to be optimistic. I had great success with zoloft until it pooped out and am really hoping that the lexapro will work just as good as the zoloft. I know everyone's mind and body reacts differently, but for me the prozac was a failure. Just work closely wit your doctor, you know your body. Peace to all :)

It worked very well for me all those years. About a year ago I thought I needed to get off of it to clean up my system. Today I started back on it and already feel less anxiety and depression. It has saved my life.

But just wanted to make sure all of you were aware of this."
