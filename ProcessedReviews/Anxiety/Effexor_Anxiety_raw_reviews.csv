Rarely do I suffer from any anxiety or feel down like I did in the past.

I found it made my range of emotions much narrower, but unfortunately it dulled the highs ... I found the higher dose was causing ED and some crazy dreams. Difficult to get off of. I am no longer taking it.
1089$Anxiousness associated with Depression$11/3/2019 11:32:39 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$It has helped my depression and anxiety, but at a cost. I have overwhelming nausea, dizziness, and headaches at least 2 days a week. I love what the drug has done for my mental health but my physical health, not so much.
1093$Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/6/2019 5:44:47 PM$Reviewer: herta, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on effexor first at 75 mg now at 115 mg for over 15 years.  I dont feel any different as a person but have less if no anxiety or depression.  I have not had any of the side effects plus i drink white wine daily.  My sleep has been very good but you do have very vivid interesting dreams.  This drug changed and saved my life.  Many other members of my direct family have also benefited from use of this medication.

After 2 years my anxiety is worse than ever. Effexor gives me the shakes, nausea, dizziness all of the stuff that triggers my anxiety itâ??s absolutely terrible. I get tremors in my sleep and terrifying nightmares. My sex drive is non existent. I canâ??t display emotion. I constantly feel like Iâ??m dreaming when wide awake. Effexor turned me into a zombie. Please do not take this drug itâ??s the worst decision Iâ??ve ever made. 
1128$Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/13/2017 2:30:29 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$2$3$ TRY ANYTHING BUT EFFEXOR! At first I thought this was helping my anxiety and depression but the side affects are AWFUL! I am about to lose my job because I have missed so much work related to the side effects! I have missed 8 days in 4 months.  I have nausea, vomiting, sweating,drowsiness,trouble sleeping,weird vivid dreams,and headaches, some are migraines. Would not have taken it if I had known the side effects!
1129$Anxiousness associated with Depression$7/6/2017 4:08:46 PM$Reviewer: Bripolar, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$18 years ago, when we had our third child, and soon after that, my Dad died. I experienced a prolonged period of depression. It begun with anxiety and all those 'lovely' attacks. I have been on Effexor for all that time. It works (only 75 mg for the past few years), but it concerns me that I have been on it for so long. My old brain (I'm now 58!) tells me if I've missed a daily dose with vivid, almost psychedelic dreams. Oh, and those really odd shocks to my physical self. Other than that, my sex drive is good, real good. I still drink and exercise a ton. You have to, right? I think this drug probably helped give me the wonderful life I am fortunate to be living.  
1136$Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/2/2017 12:19:26 AM$Reviewer: Mortimer, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$When I was prescribed this medication I read the reviews and then got kinda nervous about taking it.  I decided to only take 1 x 37.5 mg per day. I was very nauseous the first 4 days.  Had a strange vacant feeling, kinda weak, stuck it out and most of the side effects went away.  The only bothersome one I have now is slight constipation.  Magnesium citrate and Metamucil are dealing with that.  I'm pretty sleepy after I take it in the am but coffee does the trick (and no longer turns me into a nervous wreck).  I am calmer, I can concentrate better, my sense of humor is back, I feel normal, like my old self.  I'm not anxious about silly things, but I'm also not a zombie.  My dr is fine with me sticking with the low dose.  I know this drug isn't for everyone, but it is working for me.
1137$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/22/2017 7:56:33 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've had anxiety, panic attacks and depression since I was a child. I have taken most SSRI meds, but Effexor XR 150mg has been the best by far. I rarely have panic attacks, and if I do, they are mild and controllable. My anxiety in general is low and I don't get depressed any more. I also don't have any side effects (only decreased appetite which isn't so bad!) I am able to perform a stressful, professional full time job without any problems. I intend to keep taking this forever. If it works, why try and stop it?! I have never been happier.

1162$Anxiousness associated with Depression$8/4/2016 12:39:35 PM$Reviewer: nothx, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Specifically for anxiety mixed in with depression this has been a life saver. I was originally on a high dose then it went down to 150mg, then to 75mg and then to half of that, however, in the winter went back onto the 75mg dosage and have stayed on it ever since. When I was on 150mg or higher I couldn't even cry, I was very unemotional, but, at least at that time, I probably needed the high dosage. Happy with 75mg a day and also take Vitamin D with it since my test I am very low with regard to that.  
1163$Anxiousness associated with Depression$7/24/2016 3:33:40 PM$Reviewer: Joe Mama, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$This drug worked great.  I started on 75mg and stepped up to 150mg. After a few months doctor increased dosage to 225mg because worrying and paranoia were returning.  225mg worked awesome on my symptoms. It was so good not laying awake in bed, worrying about everything, thinking every whisper I heard at work was about me and feeling my blood pressure and heart rate rise, from the constant state of heightened alert required from my job.(Jailer) I stayed on this dosage for about a year and finally realized the side effects were not decreasing. The inability to orgasm, unbelievably excessive sweating (I had to change t shirts 6 hours into my shift at work) And the dreams! They seemed to last all night long and were so detailed and vivid and they seemed to continue from one night to the next!  It was almost like living another life while I slept. It became intolerable once these dreams started morphing into nightmares in which i would talk, cry and scream in my sleep (so says my wife, but I don't believe the crying part) and wake up sweating. I started taking a small dosage of welbutrin for my inability to orgasm (which I had no problem with, but my wife did). It didn't work.  Anyway, I had to quit because of the side effects, but the results for the intended purpose were incredible.  I am currently weaning off effexor and trying something else. Oh yeah!  I almost forgot the 3 to 4 days between bowel movements which culminated into an incredibly painful,humongous stool, when I finally was able to defecate! I mean really, really painful, to the point you doubt it would come out!  Another little bonus from this drug. But,hey, it worked so well, I will return to it if I can't find something better. Good luck!
1177$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/20/2016 8:32:07 PM$Reviewer: LouiseKat, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been on the 75mg dose for over a year. It took about 2 weeks to get over some of the mild side effects (felt a bit spacy and too alert at night) but since then I've felt wonderful. Feel like I've got my life back, can think clearly and just enjoy being with people and living in the moment. It's been such a life-changer I'm actually concerned about possibly needing to go off it for an extended period of time when I, hopefully, try to conceive. I went off effexor 2 months ago because my prescription ran out and didn't have any problems with coming off it. However, did have the same mild side effects for a few weeks when I went back on it. 
1183$Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/31/2016 6:39:55 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$First day i noticed that it took my sex drive away. By day five I could not get out of bed. Very weak, flu like pains in my muscles and joints. Slept for about eleven hours, and finally I was able to stumble out of bed with a headache and brain fog.

I get shaky and nauseous. I cough terribly and get diarrhea. All of this after 12 hours. It's terrible. I am on a generic form, only 75mg. When I was on name brand Effexor, this did not happen. I could go 2 days minimum, without any symptoms.

Anyone else experience drainage, and sore throat upon doing this? It's been 2 weeks today. Did not ween down to 175. Went to lower dose in one day. I really have have had no other issues, which has surprised me, as I was expecting much worse!

After a few weeks I felt great and could return to my high stress job as a Flight for Life paramedic (a job I've loved doing for the last 15 years). The job takes a toll. I fly adults/kids hurt and dying every shift to trauma centers and ERs. I'm still going through medication dose adjustments. The two issues with the drug I have noticed are acne (cystic) breakouts on my face and a lack of a sex drive. Also, the healing time for breakouts, lacerations, and scratches seems prolonged. Neither is overwhelmingly bad but I'm hoping these issues will resolve. In the meantime I've been taking Spironolactone (an underused acne wonder drug) which helps. Before taking Effexor XR I had to sedate myself to leave the house. No way could I think of going to work without panic. This drug saved my sanity and career.

Effexor was supposed to give me ""more giddy up and go.""  

So far after 5 weeks I have insomnia, crazy dreams, and had thoughts of death and very dark mood.  I went to urgent care and the provider has me taking 75 mg until my PCP is back from vacation next week.  After one day of 1/2 dose I have an unrelenting headache, agitation, and no appetite.  I feel insane.  This drug (like all drugs) is poison to my system.  I'm sure it's helpful for others, but it doesn't work for my body chemistry.  I was hopeful.  The side effects are scary.  My PCP warned that we'd have to add Prozac to the mix to taper off.  "

I have taken this for 5 years or so. Recently lost medical coverage due to job loss (husband). I ran out of my pills a few days ago & thought no big deal.......I have missed 3-4 days & have dizziness, nausea, headaches, tired, anger, crying fits, and the list goes on. This is like coming off Heroin, I think. I accidentally smashed my thumb today, which is painful & swollen, but the head ""trip"" is worse than my initial throbbing thumb. That eases, but the head rages on....also had a nosebleed that wouldn't stop. After only 2 days of these symptoms, I went to the pharmacy & refilled my prescription. No insurance but used my credit card to buy it. I feel like a drug addict!! I won't have insurance for another 2 months (new job) & my husband still unemployed. I have felt fine taking this medicine but afraid of ever running out again. This is like Crack! The last 2 days I feel as though I could really hurt someone or myself & I don't ever have these feelings. "

Happiest iv'e ever been in a really long time aside from the occasional anxiety which i take my rescue meds along with it if i feel anxious. However i will say that if i forget to take this in the morning in the afternoon i will feel awful!!!!! and if i forget to take it for a day i will begin to feel sick like I'm getting a cold or even nauseous and throw up. I will cry and think about everything bad in my life. Other than the withdrawal symptoms it works for me.

It may work for some, however I'm sure there is something better on the market that is far less addictive if you ever plan on coming off of it! 

I was prescribed this for anxiety/OCD and as far as how well it worked, I only noticed a slight difference. I felt a little less anxious, but it also made me completely numb to all other emotions too. Another side effect I noticed--I lost all of my sex drive.

When I found out I was pregnant, my doctor agreed that I should go off of this since it wasn't doing much anyway. This has proven to be a real nightmare! I took me 3 whole months to come off of it. For those of you who are struggling to come off of this now, I'll offer the method I used: 
I split open the pill, counted the ""beads"" into even amounts and took each amount for about a week until my body adjusted to it. Doctor's can prescribe lower dosage amounts, however, the jump from one dose to another may be too much of a shock to your system. For example, I jumped from the 150 mg I was taking to 75 mg, then started the bead counting to completely come off. That jump was pretty intense let me tell you!

So overall, any small effect I noticed from this pill really wasn't worth the pain of trying to get off of this nasty drug!"
1231$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/31/2014 12:18:28 AM$Reviewer: FWKYM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have suffered from anxiety and depression for over 20 years. I have tried almost every medication(s) available. Effexor XR is the only medication that allows me to function with the least side effects. I take 150 mg twice daily. I no longer have to keep xanax as a back up as I have been symptom free for many months. The only side effect I have had is headaches. The one concern is going off the medication. There was a point I could not get my Effexor refilled and after 3 days of being off it I was extremely sick. But once I got back on the medication I felt better within 3 hours. So it is important to wean off the medication if the treatment is stopped. Over-all, this medication was a life saver. 
7$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$8/1/2018 5:25:55 PM$Reviewer: EmmyJay8, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$4$I was on this drug for almost 5 years and over the last 6 months or so I decided to switch. I realized I was extremely fatigued, would get random dizzy spells, more frequent anxiety (crazy right), and just didn't feel like myself. Maybe the drug just stopped working, who knows. I was on only 75 mg but not willing to increase my dose!!! Also transitioning off the drug was NOT fun... pretty much two weeks of hell. However I am off the drug now and would not recommend it to anyone else. Also if you miss a dose - brain zaps!!!! Gross.

My issues were constant anxiety that resulted in insomnia, anger and frustration, and often confusion and disorientation.  It has helped the most with anxiety stemming from social situations, and calming the constant anxious thoughts that were causing a lot of my confusion and stress.  It has not helped as much as I had hoped with anger and frustration during stressful situations.  The first 2 weeks were awful, I was exhausted all day but had brain ""zaps"" and restless legs at night that kept me awake.  Thankfully that went away.  "

99$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/13/2014 1:53:58 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on this medication for a little more than a year now and I have seen tremendous strides in my anxiety. The medicine works in that it takes the edge off of my anxiety while keeping all other aspects of my life normal. I have seen very slight side effects, including minor weight loss and strange dreams. Overall, the benefits completely outweigh the negatives. Regarding all the negative reviews, I think that this drug works very well for very specific people - if you think it might work for you at least try it out (with assistance from your doctor, in case you need to ween yourself back off) because it has been a god send for me.

This is the 4th pill I have tried to eliminate my anxiety. I will say as far as my anxiety goes this pill has been very effective at removing my anxiety but it has made me less effective as a person. One of the first things I noticed when starting it was the constant hot flashes and sweating. After 4 months I noticed my thoughts were foggy but as long as I really focused I could get by at work. I also had my blood pressure increas so much I had to star taking pills for that as well. I also have frequent migraines, weight gain and tiredness. As I said it has been 1 year now and my mind has gotten so foggy and I have become so irritable that I am going to request my doc take me off it and we try something else before I lose my job or my family.

166$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/5/2012 10:07:40 PM$Reviewer: Linnea, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I started taking Venlafaxine 2 weeks ago. The last 3 days I have been able to tell the difference in a great, great way.

I had been suffering insomnia, OCD habits, and extreme anxiety attacks every other week on average.  After a 12 hour anxiety attack I cut off my hair with a crayola brand scissors and went to the doctor the next day. I'm giving this information to characterize how extreme my anxiety attacks were getting. I didn't feel like I was in my own body anymore. I felt out of my mind, out of control. This had been happening since June 2011. I went to the doctor finally September 2012. I am now falling asleep when I want to fall asleep, I haven't had an anxiety attack and I don't feel anxious at all, and I feel like I can control my OCD habits. The last is still strugglesome but I believe that I can do it now. I have coherent thoughts. I tell myself ""just one thing at a time"" and I can do it. I have comlete control over my actions and behavior. I'm getting my online schooling done early, not last minute. Everything is going great. 

As for side effects - the first 4 days I was sicker than hell. (stomach wise) So, if you are ready to start taking Venlafaxine, I recommend not to do so on the beginning of a work week. Instead, try starting on a saturday or a day off of work. Take it in the morning. Drink a full tall glass of water with each dose and something else in your stomach for it to absorb. 

I hope that this medication works for anyone reading this as much as it has for me. I am so happy that I decided to go to the doctor. I have control over my life now and I am very optimistic about my future. I plan to stay on this medication until I finish my bachelors degree. "

PRO's: i'm calm, no more anxiety and panic attaches. i can go out to the malls, big cities, large building without feeling anxious.i can be myself like everyone else. the drug has given my LIFE back. I LUV this drug. I'll be taking it the rest of my life, but thats OK with me. CON's: Blurred Vision and low sexual desires. These are the two main and worse symptoms that i don't like. but it looks like all the depession meds have these symptoms too. you can't miss or don't try to skip a dose. you'll get brain zaps that i can't stand. and don't try to wain yourself off unless your doctor knows and can assist you. try it you'll love it.

It worked fairly well but I was tired all the time and gained a little weight.  The weight gain could have been due to the gabapentin that I was on at the same time.  When I went off the gabapentin and stayed on this med I did start loosing weight.  I just wasn't happy with this med because I was ""dulled"" and did feel happy.  I wasn't anxious but then again I did seem to enjoy things either.  So now I am trying a new med.  Hoping it works better.  Also feel I have a new dr that is listening better than the one that prescribed this one.  "

Other than dry throat and some loss of appetite, no side effects for me. Within 5 days I was feeling better—no longer waking up early in the morning with my heart beating out of my chest and terrified, as I have been on and off for years. I feel calmer and don't worry as much. I would like to stay at this low dosage as the results have been great and I don't like taking medications for anything anyway. I still haven't regained my full appetite, which sucks, as I am a real 'foodie', but the tradeoff is worth it. I see many comments on here regarding the expense of Effexor vs. the generic. Just to let you know that in my province in Canada, with an employers medical program, 2 weeks of Venlafaxine cost me less than $4."

I've been able to deal with stress and residual depressive symptoms with exercise, relationships and eating better. I get a little more nauseous with the generic, too, but I just have to eat something when I take my meds to make that manageable. I would go back to the XR in a minute if I could afford it, but at least I can live my life with minimal side effects and no panic attacks.

When I miss a pill, the next day I am super sad, confused, dizzy, I canâ??t concentrate on anything, Iâ??m super tired, and very loopy. If you are wanting to take this medication, just know that the side effects of withdrawal are very hard, but the pill works very good in my case. I didnâ??t have any side effects getting on the pill so that was also a plus.

Initially it worked well; however, since my successful transition to a new job the source of my anxiety is now gone and I am left with side affects of the drug, primarily the lack of interest in any social activities, hobbies, and sexual activity to include ED and the lack of sexual satisfaction. I intend to speak to my doctor today about weaning off the drug. My biggest concern is that I do not experience the horrible withdraw symptoms identified in many of the reviews listed here. In my case, it was effective for the short-term (18 months) anxiety I experienced; however, it is not something I would want to be on long term.

My doc tried me on Zoloft, which made keep forgetting things. Taking Effexor has made me feel like my old self.  I'm not as anxious, I don't cry about nothing, and I'm interested in things again.  I started taking it because of the stress of nursing school and issues with my spouse, everything just piled on.  I jokingly call it my ""I don't give a crap"" med. I'm able to turn things off and not get so wrapped up in little irritating things.  The bad part is trying to wean, I only take 37.5 mg daily, it's pretty low. Do it slowly because there are dizzy spells, nausea and ""brain zaps"", I'm sure it's the serotonin levels dropping.  I know many people don't care for it, but it's really changed my life, back to somewhat normal.  "
512$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/23/2014 3:22:23 PM$Reviewer: Jared, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$4$"It is difficult to review this medication, because technically it has worked wonders for me, yet miss a dose, and it is absolutely debilitating.  I suffered from panic attacks for years and tried a variety of anti-depressants to treat them.  Most worked marginally well, and usually came with some unwanted side effects, particularly weight gain.  On Effexor, though, I feel like I've had my life returned to me, and there are practically zero side effects, provided you take it every day.  I am able to function so much better on a daily basis, and have been living a fuller life since starting this medication.  

Now for the downside.  I once missed a single dose because my pharmacy ran out, and within 6 hours of my normal dose time, I started feeling the effects.  Within 12 hours, I was sweating, nauseated, jittery, confused, etc.  I could barely sleep that night, and when I did, I had horrible nightmares.  The next day, I awoke feeling nothing like myself.  Literally, I felt like a different person was in my body.  I was incredibly irritable and had the worst vertigo I've ever experienced.  It was all I could do to get to the pharmacy once they had more, and within a couple hours of taking my dose, I was nearly back to normal.  After that incident, I did a great deal of research on this drug, and found that my experience was not uncommon at all, yet neither doctors, nor the warnings on the medication, nor the advice on site like this list any of these problems as a possibility.  I think a lot more people would be very hesitant to start this medication knowing how crippling it would be to try and get off it.  As some other reviewers have said, if there is any other option available to you, even if it doesn't work perfectly, I would strongly advise using that instead of starting an Effexor regiment. God willing, I will never miss a dose again, and God help me if I ever need to stop. :("

No question it has removed 99% of my generalized anxiety.  Enormous difference in mood; am far more relaxed, self confident, able to cope.  I over-dream, though, so I take something at night which helps about an 8 on a scale of 1 to ten.   Have put on belly and face fat (about 20 lbs after 2+ years) and libido & potency have unfortunately also been adversely effected, although not obliterated completely.

After about 4 - 6 weeks, I suddenly started to feel calmer.  Amazing difference!  After all this time, I occasionaly feel a twinge of anxiety, but my lifestyle is definitely a factor and the anxiety is still far more manageable than it used to be. 
Just don't miss a dose because you'll get the Effexor dreams!  They are bizarre and always have the unmistakable feeling of doom!
During waking hours, you may get some buzzing in the brain as well.  
However, these symptoms only happen when your system gets low on the drug.

None of them helped with my anxiety, and made me even more depressed. I have taken Effexor for anxiety/ panic attacks for 3 years now. I had a one year break, due to loss of health insurance. Effexor is a miracle to me! I did not experience the severe withdrawals that others on this forum have commented on. Any symptoms I had when quitting were extremely mild. I have suffered fom panic attacks and recurrent 'episodes' of severe anxiety since I was a teenager. While taking Effexor my panic and anxiety episodes are non existent. I currently take the drug 150 mg/day and am so thankful, I can get out of bed without all the pain I used to have, due to having panic attacks at night. And since returning to normal on the drug, it has helped me lose the weight I gained from being so anxious/depressed before I started the drug. Everyone should ask their doctor for their professional opinion, because this drug is a miracle for some people!

My job is also going better.  I would recommend the combination of Prozac and Effexor for anyone experiencing both anxiety and depression.

I was prescribed it for repeated anxiety and depression after the birth of my son. I am much more easygoing since taking this drug. I tried many different anti-depressants before this, and they usually worked well. However they were mostly ineffective for my anxiety/panic attacks. This drug is no fun if you stop taking it. If I miss a dose I feel very drowsy when I wake up about 48 hours after taking it. I went for a week without it and I got pretty nervous and on edge, I was tired, I was cranky and moody, but I was able to continue to work and take care of my son. That is probably why my doctor put me on different meds before trying this one. Now that I am on this medicine I can't imagine my life without it. I was suffering far more than I realized I was and life was far more of a struggle than it is now. I had a little nausea and blurred vision but this went away with treatment.

As I got older I tried to wean myself off of my previous medicine. I went one year without medication and it was terrible : I couldn't drive or work. I decided to go back on medication and my Doctor suggested we try Effexor. For the past 5 years I have been on a low dose of 75 mg that I take once a day before bed. My life is so much better. I can do anything. I have travelled, went to University and no longer suffer. I know I will most likely have to be on medication forever because of my chemical imbalance, and this worries me for when I want to start a family (I haven't read too many positives about being on Effexor and pregnant). If i miss a dose I can tell right away as I feel dizzy and disorientated. The pros of this medication outweigh the cons for me.

I might give this med a few weeks to see if I can manage the pain.  And, I have not noticed any change in my appetite.

I wish my doctor would have told me about the side effects of going off the drug before I started taking it. I NEVER would have started taking it, I would have opted for something else.    "

It worked well for the first little while, then stopped, so my doctor increased the dosage and I've been fine since. My problem now is that I want to go off it. A few times I've tried to go off it all at once. After just 2 days I felt horrible. I felt like little shocks were going through my mouth and into my head. I also cried about everything. Each time my husband convinced me to go back on it.  Now I desperately want to go off it again right now. I don't know why. I don't want to go off gradually with a doctor; I just want to be off it now.

Recently, I've been having severe anxiety attacks and my doctor decided to use this in order to help with the anxiety. The first couple of weeks were torture but after that the side effects did subside. Now I've been having terrible and weird nightmares. It didn't really help with the anxiety but however it does work with my IBS and my compulsions. For myself, it really was kind of a hit and miss; it treats one thing but not the other.

The paic attacks started at a very young age and over the years, I developed many phobias as a result.  I was given many drugs over the years, but never took them.  My life became ""smaller"" and ""smaller"", and in desperation, after many years of therapy that never really helped, I agreed to take Effexor.  For two weeks, I had every reaction listed.  But at the end of the two weeks, my life began.  All of the fear and anxiety was gone!  All the things I couldn't do for years, or would do with incredible fear, was not a problem.  I consider it a miracle!  Yes, I don't like to think I will have to take it always, but I know that my disorder is genetic and won't go away because it is a chemical imbalance. Many of my family members and children have the same issues.  I know I was lucky, and on the first try, got the right medication for me. Life is good."
846$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/23/2009 11:28:29 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$3$4$"My experience with Effexor changed after the first six months.  I take 75 mg daily.  The first six months were great.  I had some side effects at first, but after a week, they went away almost completely.  It really helped with my anxiety and I was very satisfied.  

After about 6 months on Effexor, things started to change and I started feeling pretty bad.  Now I feel a little dizzy and ""drunk"" all of the time.  I also have a minor headache all the time, which occasionally escalates into a debilitating migraine.  I've also noticed I'm more compulsive than I used to be.  For example, I feel a compulsion to do the same things after work every day.  Or, if I start a task (cleaning or gardening for example), I can't stop until I have finished every single possible related job.

Has anyone else noticed this?  My first instinct is to stop taking it.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?  I don't really know what to do now.  I don't want to feel anxious any more, but I also don't want to feel the way I feel right now.  Any comments would be appreciated!"

I've been on that now for 2 months. The only side effects I've suffered are dry mouth and difficulty reaching orgasm. It has been worth it though because my quality of life has improved.

This is a complicated medication.  When I was switched to it, I was given short-term disability for reasons I didn't know at the time, but went with it.

Now that I look back, this med is just as hard to go on as it is to go off!  Going on, I had episodes of serious nausea to the point where I had to pull of the side of the road because I thought I had to vomit.  

When that is said and done, the medication DOES work.  I experienced no anxiety attacks at all.  That was pretty cool, but let me tell you, you surely don't need to watch a clock so you don't miss a dose.  For me, when the clock got close to meds time, the withdrawl symptoms of this med started rearing their ugly head.  I mean, even within an hour or so of the time it is normally taken...an internal alarm clock, of sorts.

What you read about withdrawl symptoms is COMPLETELY accurate.  I've always described them as ""the throbs"", but brain zaps works juts as well.  They get worse REALLY QUICKLY and it is the most debilitating feeling.  Keep missing them and you can be keeping your head still and just move your eyes and those ZAPS move whenever your eyes hurt. You are kind of ""zombied"".  It is HORRIBLE.  

It's been 6 years since starting this stuff and the ONLY reason why I am still on it is because it is easier than going off...seriously. I cannot EVEN believe there hasn't been any sort of law-suit with how horrific the side-effects are!!! 

Today, my meds are late coming in the mail and I am nearly 48 hours down and in a state of complete bewilderment, so to speak.  I am crying because of the w/drawls...it is TRULY that bad and I had to get a script called into the pharmacy so I don't lose my head.  
There ought to be a law against stuff like
 this...SERIOUSLY.

I started having panic attacks on 2010, although I didn’t know what they were at the time. The attacks got much worse after a heart attack in 2015. Symptoms included loss of appetite, nausea, shaking, headache and even dental pain. I was in the hospital three times for these symptoms over the past 4 years with no resolution. I finally went to the hospital in November 2017. I suspected these issues were anxiety related and a doctor offered me a prescription for 75 mg of Effexor (started with 37.5 mg for the first week).  Symptoms subsided fairly quickly over the first week and I had a good Christmas. It’s been seven months now and I’m feeling great. All symptoms are gone. I’ve been eating good, sleeping, good and have been very active outside, biking and doing yard work (retired in 2014). Still on 75mg. No significant side affects other a mild reduction in sexual activity. It’s definitely been very effective for me. Hope it keeps up.

Been taking Ativan daily for over 10 years to treat panic attacks and anxiety. All of sudden one day started having extreme disturbing thoughts and the Ativan was barely helping anymore. Miserable for about 6 months with this new strange anxiety/panic with crazy horrible thoughts was really creating a lot of despair in my life. Luckily and by the grace of God I found a deacon of my church that steered me to a really good psychiatrist. He prescribed me effexor xr 37.5 mg 2x a day. Initially no relief but after about 2 weeks slowly but surely I began to feel normal and not having any disturbing thoughts. What a blessing to feel at peace again. Wasn't even feeling much need for the Ativan anymore. Before the new anxiety/crazy thoughts started i was averaging .5 of Ativan a day and feeling fine for the most part. Then after I started having disturbing thoughts all of sudden and out of the blue (was on a trip driving out of town when it began). Anyways, it was disturbing me so much that I was taking anywhere from 2mg to 3mg of Ativan a day just to get by and was still feeling miserable and feeling I was at my breaking point almost entirely from morning til night. And now for over a month i felt normal almost 100 percent of the time. Reduced my Ativan down to 1mg a day and sometimes don't even feel the need for it. I take 37.5 mg in the morning and at night and my goal is to get off the Ativan all together and only being on the effexor. Thank God it helped me tremendously and I hope anyone that suffers from what I did can get the help and peace that I did! God bless and heal all who suffer with all mental illness!!

Side effects for me are vivid dreams, which are great when they're great, but other times not so much... And if I missed a dose at 150mg by the end of the day I could tell because my lower jaw and tongue had tingles (I haven't missed a dose at 75mg so idk the effects).

Although it worked well for me at 150 mg a day I developed a rash on my shins and severe constipation.  I began reading up on weening myself off of it and learned that there are severe side effects when trying to get off of it.  After lowering the dosage for the last 3 weeks, per my new doctor's instructions, I am now on my 4th day without it and agree with what I read about how difficult it is to stop taking this drug.  The brain spasms or zaps, disorientation, dizziness, nausea, headaches, sleepiness and generally not being able to function has been almost unbearable.  Thankfully, I have been off work for 4 days because I definitely would not be able to function at work.  All this after only about 5 months on this drug.  What really upsets me is that the doctor that prescribed this to me did not mention how bad the withdrawal symptoms would be when getting off of it. I have even read that some of the symptoms may be permanent for people that have taken this drug for an extended amount of time.  I am so glad at this point that I developed the rash and constipation so I was not on it for any longer.  I would HIGHLY suggest you think twice before starting this drug and can only hope my symptoms will subside with time.

My partner noticed a huge change in me for the better, even my doctor was surprised at how well my demeanor was last visit. We tried pristiq and it SUCKED! Just get generic Effexor and thank me later. Haha I even recently took a trip and haggled over a tour that me and my partner went on, that may not sound like a big deal but I'm so used to being the guy who won't even make eye contact with people. I'm in awe of this medication it's helping me get over the silly things in life that used to cripple me.

I first started on 75 mg time released capsule and then to 150. Due to my increase in blood pressure, I needed to be taken off effexor.  We tapered it down...but I never, never, never felt this horrible!  I went off this medicine with my doctors help....but I can't believe the withdrawal symptoms.  Had I known the withdrawal was like this, I would have never started effexor in the first place--yes, it helped, but NOTHING is worth feeling like this.  From now on, I will check if there are any withdrawal symptoms on ANY medicine I may be prescribed---still can't believe how bad the withdrawal is---and to think some people just go off this stuff???  Don't know how they do/did it!  If someone came to me today and said they were being prescribed Effexor~~I would honestly tell them to NOT start it---the side effects are not worth it, at least not in my opinion!

Every time I tried to get off of it, I experienced horrible withdrawal symptoms.  Being on the drug numbed me.  I was very laid back and experienced less anxiety and depression but at what cost?  I wasn't really ""me.""  Also decreased my libido and I had to take Wellbutrin to counteract the sexual side effects.  I was on it way too long, thanks to my psychiatrist who wanted to keep collecting her money every month.  Switched doctors and was weaned off of it with Prozac, experienced no withdrawal symptoms.  I feel better than ever, have been anxiety/depression med-free for over a year now.  Beware this drug!"

I just wanted to write a review because I read so many bad reviews online. Don't be afraid to give this medicine a try-- people with anxiety are the most likely to worry about side effects! My first couple of weeks on this medicine I kept waking up too early in the morning (I take it in the morning). I also had nausea and appetite suppression. Those side effects went away after a couple of weeks. For the next six weeks I had a lot of difficulty orgasming... now it is still harder than it was before the medicine, but it's nothing terrible. Here's the good news: I am free from obsessive thinking! It's like the skies have opened up for me! Bad things still happen, but I feel like I have much more of a choice of how to respond! It's very empowering. I am loving Effexor.

Effexor has done wonders for me in both of these areas.  However, this drug is a wicked Catch-22 because it is nearly impossible to go off it. Don't let any doctors fool you into believing you might experience ""minor withdrawal symptoms"".  This drug is evil when it comes to trying to get off the medication.  It is almost a guarantee that you will experience major nausea and flu-like symptoms, dizziness, ""brain zaps"" or what feel like jolts of electricity shooting through your head, and major disorientation.  I have been trying to get off of this medication for over a year with no success.  My doctor tried to taper me off by substituting Prozac every other day, but that does not work at all.  I'm still on 37.5mg and cannot figure out what to do.  All the while, these doctors act like it's no big deal to go off this drug.  They have no idea what they're talking about unless they have experienced it themselves.  If you Google ""Effexor Withdrawal"" you will find hundreds of message boards with people complaining that they can't get off this medication.  If you take it, plan to be on it the rest of your life.  Oh, and it made me gain 20 pounds even though I work out 5 days a week.  "

As most people have mentioned, going off this drug is hell.  I experienced major brain zaps, dizziness, nausea, headaches, disorientation, shakiness, and confusion.  If a doctor or shrink ever tells you that withdrawal is easy and you just taper off gradually, they have no idea what it's actually like to go off this drug.  I honestly think it should be taken off the market or reviewed by the FDA.  It also made me gain about 15 pounds and I only take 37.5mg.  I exercise 7 days a week and don't eat like a pig, so I know it's this evil drug.

I took a lower dose for a week then another lower dose for a week then half a dose for a week and so on. I was so sick. I was throwing up for 2 weeks and so sick for a month. I could hardly get out. I felt like little electrical shocks would zap my head. It's so hard to explain but I thought maybe I was wrong. I started reading other peoples experiences too and they were the same. My friend also had bad withdrawls and had to get back on it because she couldn't function at work. DON'T go with this one, try another one.

If I took the drug even five minutes later than normal, I would vomit. If I took the drug without enough to eat, I would vomit. The sickness was accompanied by sweating, shivering, and weakness.

Going off the drug was akin to a heroin addiction. Visual hallucinations. Lucid dreams. Lucid nightmares. Stomach pains so bad that I blacked out. Sweating. Nausea. Dizziness. Extreme weakness. Panic attacks. Off the chart anxiety.

That being said, I would like to point out that this was after a few years of taking the drug. It did work for a time and I remember thinking that I felt better (this was paired with therapy sessions).

I also did not wean myself off of the drug. Once side effects started I stopped taking it. This was a mistake. My symptoms may have been greatly reduced if I had weaned off of this instead of going cold turkey.

I have had friends that have had similar experiences with this medication. I have also had friends that have had great experiences with this medication.

It is all a matter of your body and your reaction to medications. Sometimes you have to try a few before finding the one that is right for you. It is a journey. Good Luck."

1464$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/21/2013 3:02:27 PM$Reviewer: DK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$1$2$I went on this medication after being diagnosed with post partum anxiety. It pretty much made me lifeless...no emotions, no feelings, just there. Not even a year past when I learned ways to cope with the anxiety attacks, tried to ween off this medication and ended up freaking out because I could not stand how sick I became. I had brain 'zaps' that would not subside and felt like a basket case. I immediately took a pill and felt great after 2 hours. Talked with my dr about trying it again and he suggested dropping the dose this time and for a few days I felt horrible with the brain 'zaps' and just generally miserable. This time though it subsided so I tried the next step which again made life impossible to live. I was in bed for a few days before I starting taking taking the normal does again. Finally after 2 years and a dr who I felt would not help me get off this medication I was able to quit cold turkey from the lowest does. It was awful. I was sick for a week straight before I learned that benadryl relaxed everything so the brain 'zaps' would disappear as long as I took it. I have never felt better and really wish I had looked up the withdrawal side effects for this drug. Some people get it worse than others and it can last up to weeks. It took 5 weeks before I was able to stop taking the benadryl. If you are taking this for a short-term please reconsider it took 2 years for what should have been only a few months.
1470$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/13/2013 2:11:34 AM$Reviewer: drugfree, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$1$4$"I went through several months of panic attacks and episodes of anxiety that usually occurred in the evening.  The anxiety would keep me awake at night and after weeks with only a 2 to 4 hrs of sleep at night, I went to see a doc.  we tried a few other meds to help me sleep before trying any anxiety meds.  The sleep meds either didn't help or kept me drowsy all day.  we switched to a few anti-anxiety meds then settled on Effexor.  It resolved the anxiety issues and the sleep problems.  However, I experienced, what I characterize, severe sexual dysfunction, reduced sexual desire, headaches, loss of appetite for several weeks, then increased appetite, constipation and chronic sleepiness.  I would describe the sleepiness as almost like narcalepsy.  I lost energy and had little desire to do anything.  Finally, I ""forgot"" to take a dose.  I had terrible nightmares that night and difficulty staying asleep.  I had even more significant headaches the next day, horrible dizziness - it felt like I was withdrawing from cocaine or something.  That was enough.  I just stopped taking it.  After a few days, I feel normal again with a significant increase in energy.  My advice:  stay away from these drugs!  Don't get hooked!  You should find out what triggers the anxiety/panic attacks and increase physical activity.  Eat better and learn to relax!"

I didn't want to take an anxiety drug, and effexor really didn't help until I reached the minimal clinical dose of 150 mg/day.  Had to take Extended time release; immediate release made me sick to my stomach.  For me, this med has been VERY effective in restoring chemical/good hormone imbalance caused by my constant pain.  I do notice that missing a dose (once daily) I become more irritable, but get back to ""normal"" shortly after taking pill.  The benefits of this med OUTWEIGH the RISKS.  If your doctor didn't walk you through the side effects, get a different doctor.  Ultimately it's your body, your decision.  This med correct a chemical imbalance in your brain, so you are naive to think you won't experience problems if you just stop taking this med.

If you experience ED, you may ask your doctor to consider wellbutrin instead of effexor."

Taking this medication leaves me feeling calm/at peace without the side effect of feeling drowsey,tired or ""medicated"". The only down side I have ever felt is not feeling able to cry when I felt I would normally do so. I won't say I can't cry but it is a rare occurance... as opposed to being something I would have found myself doing often, and with little reason. I am much happier and less ""unreasonable"" now that I am taking Effexor regularly. I am 60 years old and now only use 37.5m daily. Going without the medication is still not an option for me.

I had hurted myself at work and I couldn't sleep and was feeling anxious. I expressed my concern about taking that type of drugs but was reassured by my doctor that they were not addictive and as soon as I wanted to stop taking them all would be fine. The first first time I tried to stop I could not get out of bed. I was feeling so ill I had to call in sick at work. I spent two days like this. I went back to see him and explained what happened and was told that after a couple days I would be fine. Wrong!! I kept taking the tablets because I could not handle feeling so sick. Even after all this still I was not told that I needed to come off them slowly . When I went back to see him, he was away so I had to see another Dr who gave me a lower dose and explained that I needed to take the lower dose for a while before I could come off them completely. I did this for 2 months and then decided that it was time to stop. Had enough. If I had known what was to come I would have never ,ever listened to my doctor and trusted him. It has been over two months now and I'm still having withdrawal symptoms. The nausea, light headed, heart racing,finding it difficult to concentrate, lack of libido, sudden feelings of sadness or anger, sweating even when it's cold, nightmares, just to name a few.

I feel that I am stuck on this medication!!  I have gone from 112.5 mg to 75 mg I've added Prozac to it now.  I feel great, however I feel like a prisoner at the same time!  I'm thinking I would have been better with out it!

It has been wonderful for me. I was having panic attacks and chest pain that I thought was a heart attack. I was yelling constantly at my children and would have fits of crying. Both my parents suffered from anxiety.  I went on this and a rescue medication. After 3 months I was able to get off the rescue med and continue on this.  I have not had any more panic attacks, or chest pain. I am more patient with my children and my husband loves that I dont get upset at little things like I used to. I am more mellow. The only down side was that it made me sleepy. That diminished after about 3 months.  I keep my pills in a pill strip so that I remember to take on every day. When I forget it gives me horrid headaches.  I know there is a generic now, but I am sticking with the name brand. If you go to the effexor website you can get a card which gives you up to 75.00 off your copay. My insurance charges me over 85.00 a month now because there is a generic, but with the copay card I pay just 10.00 a month.  I was in a horrible place before this medicaion and I dont want to go back there. I hope it continues to work for me.

Took care of my anxiety & hormonal mood swings 100% but helped me feel normal, as myself. Major complaint was lowered sex drive & insomnia; kept me up all night...never slept. Had to discontinue after learning of pregnancy...horrible side effects that lasted 3 weeks: electric shocks orginating from brain to core of body, dizzyness, and mood swings out of control.  Only antidepressant that worked for my hormones however. My mom and sister did well on this too, may have a genetic component.

I do experience trouble finding words sometimes, night sweats, tremors in the mornings... but not to the point that it bothers me much.  I have taken this in the past and coming off of it is horrible.  The brain ""zaps"" are annoying and the feeling of being out of my mind was awful for a few weeks.  I am well aware of all of that now that I am taking the meds again.  I tried a few others after coming off effexor xr and they just didn't benefit me the same way.  So don't fear that this drug will ruin your life.  It has helped me get mine back.  Know what to expect when you come off of it.  Follow your doctor's advice for stopping it.  Or just stay on it!  I plan to for a while.  For more positives, I have not lost my sexual drive at all.  I have also lost 20lbs in the 6 months I have been on it with little effort.

Make sure your Doctor graduallys increases your meds- I started at 37.5 and it kicked myt a$$!! After a month or so I went to 75, and then to one 37.5 and on3 75 pill. I've been on it for a year and a half, and after being on 150 mg for over 6 months, just moved up one more step. The only real side effects that I still get are yawning ( espicially when I take the pill late) and restless legs.

It really helped; once the side effects in the beginning (felt like speed) wore off. It was increased to 150 later on, it seemed like an answer for me. I did however, have a lot more migraines. Ins only paid for generic a few months ago, and I felt different. I started having more ANXIETY panic attacks. I started feeling more depressed. Now that I am in a better emotional state, I went from 150 to 75mg. This alone seemed to help me, as I am having LESS panic attacks, and don't feel as tired. I want to go completely off of it now, but I fear The ""Brain Ticks"" feeling (I get when I miss a pill). I also am going to the bathroom more regularly now.

I am sleepy during the day, to the point of falling asleep while driving.  I am in wonderful shape emotionally, but dread the day I decide to wean off of it once again.  I went through the brain zaps, dizziness and self-torture of ""cold turkey"" last time, and at least my doctor and I know what to do this time.  My doctor did not know about the withdrawal problems the first time... I had to educate him and tell him about weaning off gradually.  This med is wonderful, and saved my life, literally.

I was originally prescribed Celexa, Lexapro (which I hated, although I know many others who swear by it), and EffexorXR with Effexor being simultaneously the most effective yet most difficult to adjust to.  Withdraw was annoying but not unbearable.  I found the worse symptoms occur from not being properly titrated.  My doctor started me on 150mg after being off of the drug for 2 years.  I'm now one week into the treatment and have severe diarrhea, no appetite at all, and have hardly slept a good nights sleep in a week.  Please don't be discouraged by this drug by my review, it certainly improved my quality of life when prescribed properly. However Effexor when not properly prescribed can make a patient non-compliant and unwilling to seek much needed treatment due to these uncomfortable side effects.  To all suffering from depression and anxiety out there, I wish you all the best and i hope my review was helpful.

I'll tell you what I am doing that seems to lessen the withdrawal effect. First get a notepad because you are going to want to write everything down because you will be decreasing your dosages. Your effexor XR capsule will have little white beads inside of it. Depending on your dosage, that is how many beads are in it. My dose is 75 mg, so I have 75 little white beads in it. Step 2 is to get a small dark colored bowl and a pencil. Next wiggle ""cap"" off the capsule. This is the shorter end of the capsule. Once you have it off then set it to the side. Now you will see that there are the tiny little white beads inside. Do not dump the entire content of beads into the dark colored bowl! (I use the dark colored bowl since it's easier to spot and count the beads). Now while holding the capsule, tip it slightly to loosen the beads up and grab your pencil. With the pencil tip, easily scrape the beads out one at a time if you can. Always check your bowl and COUNT the white beads because you need to be exact. EVERY DAY YOU WILL REDUCE YOUR DOSAGE BY 5 WHITE BEADS! DON'T REDUCE BY ANYMORE THAN THAT OR YOU WILL DEFINITELY EXPERIENCE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS! Once you remove 5 beads from the capsule, screw the top ""cap"" on snug. You will have to wiggle it back on. Discard the beads preferably in an old medicine bottle with a child-proof cap. Take the capsule with at least a bottle of water to wash down and WITH food. Do not take with juice because I heard it can increase the effects of medications. So far I have reduced by Effexor dosage from 75 mg to 40mg with no side effects. I am really starting to feel like I am getting my personality back! Plus I have dropped a few pounds since my body is feeling alive again. I recommend this method to anyone wanting to get off this Effexor nightmare. Do not stop cold turkey or you'll be like a person experiencing a heroin withdrawal and that's not a pretty sight!"

So I asked for something to deal with my three-month (like clockwork) ""OH MY GOD EVERYTHING IS WRONG THE WORLD IS ENDING I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED BUT FEEL LIKE RUNNING AROUND THE BLOCK LIKE A LUNATIC BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE I AM JUMPING OUT OF MY SKIN"" episodes. Sorry for the all caps, but trust me, those episodes are all caps worthy. I've only been on Effexor for a few days but feel rather zombie-like, have zero appetite, am dizzy, and feel nauseous. My doc advised me to stick with it for one month to see if it begins working. This is a tough decision for me, because although the Celexa did work wonders for a good amount of time with little to no side effects, this Effexor is making me nervous."

At first I felt it was a God send because of the death of my best friend and horrible other losses and demanding job not letting up! I found I was tired than normal, I put on weight and had not near the same drive and motivation as normal. I am usually a top performer in sales and care very much about excellence and all the sudden, when you are use to an A performance C was just fine. Some of that was ok, I guess I needed a break from Ms. over achiever however, sleeping to much was affecting my life allot. I could just go to work come home and sleep and sometimes if I did not take a nap in the day I would be sick. Coming off the drug is the worst physical side affects I have ever experienced and I had no idea how long it will last. I am attempting to ween myself off and I am having horrible sweats, dizziness nause and horrible night mares. If you try to go off cold turkey it is so much worse than the stomach flu, you wish you were dead! I wish I had been given other choices and had known that this was an addictive drug. If I had it to do over I would have much rather endured the weeping and heart ache than the tremendous ordeal and physical side effects this has been! I cannot wait till this is entirely out of my body! Please if there is another non addictive drug take that! This is horrible!!! If you have to get up and work your life will be hell untill this has been cleansed entirely from your system. I am not sure how long that process takes but would love to hear a report of someone who made it off and how long it took them to ween from the drug and the side effects leaving.

I have tried several antidepressants for my anxiety disorder and this one seems to work the best for me. When I felt that I didn't need anything anymore the Doctor had me wean off and low and behold the  withdrawal symptoms that you read about for this drug were horrible... for two and 1/2 weeks I was nauseous and dizzy with vertigo symptoms non stop and lost weight. After the withdrawal wore away is when I felt that I needed something yet to help control my anxiety. I am now on the 3rd drug and am almost ready to tell my doctor that I'd rather be back on Effexor XR again. Only one other downfall other than the withdrawal symptoms is it causes low libido. We have to work on that one.
2008$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$8/8/2010 8:57:09 PM$Reviewer: MW, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I experienced HORRIBLE anxiety after my first child was born, to the point that I could not sleep or care for my baby.  I hated life and asked my husband if we could give our child up for adoption.  I knew something was seriously wrong, so I went to the doctor.  They put me on Zoloft, but it didn't work and I didn't have several weeks to wait and see if it would work.  I went back to the doctor, and they put me on Effexor XR.  It started working within a few days and significantly increased the quality of my life.  I could take care of my baby again and began sleeping better and enjoying life again.  The only side effect I noticed was strange dreams, but that was a small price to pay for feeling human again.  I was on it for about a year and decided to wean off it after finding out that I am pregnant again.  I was on a dose of 75mg/day, and it took me about two and a half weeks to wean off Effexor completely.  The only side effect of weaning off was that my head felt ""floaty"" - I joked with my husband that I felt like a bobblehead.  I am starting to feel more anxiety again and may go back on it if it is safe to use during pregnancy.  I know Effexor is not for everyone, but it truly has been a miracle drug for me."

I have lived with severe anxiety my whole life. The benefits of this medication in the past 5 weeks are AMAZING! I do have a few concerns, I don't care for the daily left temple headache that comes and goes through out the day; but not stressing about everything all the time makes me happier than I have ever been! The other two side effects I have are that it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy sex or orgasm anymore and some nights I wake (3-5 am) and have HORRIBLE episodes of anxiety to the point of a panic attack much worse than before I started taking the Effexor.  I thought this medication was ""constant"". Is there a ""low time"" with this medication?? No one else has commented on this in any other post so maybe it's just me? I am very worried about increasing or weaning from this medication per all the reviews here but I am SO COMPLETELY HAPPY during the day without all the looping crazy thoughts in the back of my mind that have plagued my life prior to the Effexor XR. Lastly, I also take Adderall for ADD, I am glad I talked to the Pharmacist before starting the Effexor, he told me that I needed to space the two medications a minimum of 2 hours apart every morning or I would not be happy with the side effects."

Right now I am weaning off of it. These withdrawal descriptions are scaring the hell out of me! They are enough to create anxiety themselves!

However, I began feeling more and more aggitated and anxious. Plus, the weight gain and not able to stop it created ""image issues"". I decided to come off the medicine. I spoke to my doctor and began the awful process of weaning off the drug. Once getting from 75mg to 37.5mg was not so bad. But then when I was down to nothing the pain began....the nausea, vomiting, ""brain zaps"", tingling in my arms and legs, and feeling not in control of my emotions became too much to bear. I started lashing out at my husband and one night it got so bad I tried to committ suicide! 
I am in the process of finding other alternatives to control these symptoms...Valerian root and ginger tea have helped me the most!!

I was not advised of the horrific withdrawal symptoms. My GP prescribed me this without any discussion or explanation.  I was originally on 150mg per day and then reduced to 75mg (not without problems). Thereafter managed to reduce to 37.5 mg twice per day and then one 37.5mg per day. Each time I reduced I experienced withdrawal.  I recently stopped taking Effexor, on the advice of a Consultant. The withdrawal symptoms are terrible. I have electric shock like feelings in my head which travel down my arms whenever i move my eyes from side to side, extremely sensitive to sound, shaking, nausea, disorientation, vertigo, either insomnia or extreme sleepiness, nightmares, weakness, flu like symptoms. I have now reached day 6 off Effexor and no sign of the  withdrawal abating.  I am now seeking the help of a counsellor to assist me in coping with not only the withdrawal but the terrible mood swings.  My life has completely changed since taking and coming off this drug, and not for the better. I would say to anyone thinking about taking Effexor to think carefully before doing so and be aware of what you are going into.

I'm going to give you complete details, because I wish someone had maybe done the same about a year ago when I was searching desperately for answers to my many questions.  Here goes. ME: I am a forty-something male, married, two sporty kids.  Profession requires public speaking and frequent client interaction.  I was a professsional athlete and continue to work out almost every day.  PROBLEM: I've always been extremely anxious around people, although few people knew it.  It was a constant struggle being around people other than those I knew really well.  I was also nervous talking to important clients or making important presentations, but, again hid it.  The reality, though, was I was not enjoying myself, avoided all such situations, and therefore didn't excel at many things I did, despite the fact that I am a very smart, witty and caring person (don't mean to sound vain - just saying I've always had the tools to be an extremely successful person, but my anxiety/depression squelched everything).  My anxiety occassionally elevated to full blown panic attacks where it was obvious to the people I was with that I was nervous.  I know now that I was experiencing related depression as well. At times I would get into a complete funk, tired and exhausted, despite the fact I was getting lots of sleep.   I would be in a fog. CURE: My GP prescribed ativan at first, since my primary c

I had started taking prozac about 6 months after my daughter was born, stayed on that about 1 year but experienced weight gain, stayed sleepy. went off that about a year, then started having anxiety again, crying at the drop of a hat. My doc recommended effexor.  I asked to stay on lowest possible dose, and have really liked this mecication.  the only side effects I noticed when I 1st started were extreme ""energy"" esp. when I 1st woke up, and some trouble sleeping, but I was already having trouble with that. That subsided quickly enough, the only other thing that was significant was headaches, but I can't say for sure that it was from med.  They have stopped too. I feel effexor has allowed me to be the person I'm meant to be.  I feel very happy and ""normal"" again, even better that ever.  The few side effects I have/had were not enough for me to stop taking it.  A co-worker quit her effexor cold turkey and told me "" you've got to get off that stuff"" story similar to other posts here.  My take is--don't stop any meds like that cold turkey, that's just dumb.  And everyone is different, but I would stay on as low a dose as possible, I think It makes it easier if you do decide to stop.  I wish I didn't have to take anything, but since I do, I like this med.  With prozac I felt sluggish, and was ravenous all the time, but not with this.  I feel very energetic most of the time, and don't worry like I used to.  But there are alot of meds out there, try something different if one doesn't do it for you."

This is the 2nd time I have been on it and at 150 mg per day, I have not noticed any side effects. It's a good depression medication but not so much for anxiety.

My doctor prescribed XR as it was the latest and greatest drug out there.  Initially it worked wonders.  For the first time I could breathe freely everyday, I was productive, and never nervous.  A few years in I decided this wasnt something that I wanted to take forever, especially since my MD warned me it wasnt for long term use and it should have changed my chemistry.  I weaned myself off, which I expected to be painful based on others experiences, and it was.  That wasnt the worst part though.  After withdrawal ended I was left feeling like I had no brain.  Years later I still feel the same way.  I have no memory, I'm always at a loss for words, and I can't begin to articulate my thoughts.  Effexor changed my life for the good for a very small amount of time, but the damage it has done has been much much worse.  I can only hope its not permanent.  Be very careful when taking this drug.  Think long and hard about the side effects, because there will be some, and what you would do if it fundamentally changed you if you decided to stop taking it.

Then every 2nd day.  Then every 3rd day.  I was totally fine with the exception of one day of feeling ""off"" but tried to tell myself that my blood sugar was low; basically to trick myself into believing it was something else.  Because maybe it was?  I was determined to get off this before i experienced what others say is impossible.  It can be done with minimal impact to your life if you have the right mindset and determination to do it.  I did transition to another anti-depressant (Celexa 20 mgs), which probably helped a little.  I'm determined to get off this one as well in another month or so. "

It's been 1 year now And I'm down to 1/2 of a 37.5  pill a week,down from 225 a day.

It worked really well, it did, but now that i am trying to get off of it I want to die! I have serious anxiety around vomiting and nausea and they are the number 1 and 2 withdrawal symptoms!! Its been 8 days without the drug and I still have a hard time concentrating, I can't move quickly or I'll become nauseous, I dry heave in the morning or sometimes randomly, I am SO FREAKIN HOT and I can't cool down, I sleep all day (even at work - thank goodness for a wellness room), I've got muscle spasms, ""brain zaps"" where its like the world does a shuffle inside my skull...DO NOT GO ON THIS DRUG UNLESS YOU HAVE SERIOUSLY DEEP, DEEP DEPRESSION. There are much better options out there. I have been on 6 other medications, this one working the best for ""moods"" but I had no libido and was more or less numb for the entire time and the withdrawal is not even remotely worth it. It almost negates anything good Effexor ever did for me. If given a choice, I'd go back to Wellbutrin. That said, I've opted out of the antidepressant route all together and am going to a Naturopath and dealing with my issues through CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). 
Please really consider your reasons for needing to be on medication and how long you think you may be on it. Effexor, if it has to be used, should only be as a very last resort. VERY LAST - it is like withdrawing from heroine, and i was on the absolute lowest prescibable dosage!!"

I think that it may be a mildly addictive drug.

As regards coming off the drug,what I remember most were the ""brain zapping"" jolts, like an electric current flashing through your head.These passed quickly but are unpleasant.

Side effects: Sweating,teeth-grinding,mild euphoria,intermittent libido, problems with sleeping.

I'm back on the drug again now and Iknow whn to cut down on the strength/frequency of the dosage when I feel high after a couple of days.

Overall, it helped me when I was in a very poor mental state but remember:

The drug is going to affect everyone in their own way.Make your own decision, Talk to your doctor and READ THE BLOODY LABEL before taking this, or any, drug.The Internet means that there is little excuse for ignorance,but exercise caution.

Then when I got home, the anxiety got worse.  I felt like I was losing my mind, totally unlike myself. I decided I needed to see my doctor immediately because I knew something was not right.  He gave me Effexor-I started on 37.5 dose for 10 days, then increased to 75mg a day.  The first time I took it, I felt this overwhelming sensation of cool happiness and I knew it was going to help me.  My anxiety didn't completely go away but it has made a huge difference in how I felt during that time.  My doctor said he can increase the dosage but I didn't want to for fear of being overly medicated and too dependent on it.  Now that I have been on it for 6 months, I feel okay to increase it, if need be.  I am a little apprehensive of what type of withdrawal side effects I will feel, but I am confident in my doctor and will follow his instructions to decrease my dosage slowly.  I know everybody has their own experience with this medication, but I wanted to share mine in hope's that it will help someone feel okay about taking it.  I had not intended to write this review but I read the guy's experience who wrote on 5/30/09 @ 3:21pm and it touched me.  So I hope this will help someone. Also, turning to my faith, family, and friends has been a tremendous help.

I have also taken the new Pristiq, it helps but less for GAD.(even though they are basically the same thing-and metabolize differently. The best way to get off the effexor xr is reduce your dose to 37.5 and take 5mg or 10mg prozac. After 1 week discontinue the effexor and continue to take the prozac for 3 to 4 weeks. This should help minimize the withdrawls, everyone is different so you can tweek it to your needs.

I was very hesitant to start taking this medication due to a bad episode with Lexapro about 5 years ago. I'm on 75 mg and getting used to this drug was no picnic. Although the side effects were rough, I had to admit that there were periods of ""calm"" that made me think if this is how I was going to feel when I was used to the medication, then this IS worth it.

I've been on the medication for about 4 months now and it's been pretty good so far. I no longer have panic attacks and surprisingly rarely get nervous before giving presentations at work (something I could barely do before). One of the only things that I don't like is that I seem a bit ""numb"" and have become more forgetful. I sometimes have a hard time concentrating, too. I've read about the symptoms of withdrawal, which alone would make me stay on this drug...especially if it was like the side effects I had when I started it. 

My family says that I seem more happy and less anxious. I've had no problems facing situations that used to make me feel uncomfortable, which is a huge plus. I'm able to go to the theater, be in large crowds, and my ""nervous stomach"" seems to have disappeared! My next test is a plane trip we're taking late in May. If I can get through that trip without incident, then I feel almost ""cured."" Overall, I'm glad I gave it a chance and wish I would have done this years ago. "

The worst is the electrical shock feeling in the brain. Like i said it did a good job helping with the anxiety but BE AWARE of the serious side effects when stopping. All the i have listed that i have experienced are listed right in the official effexor xr website. I wish i would have know this stuff prior to because i would have seriously concidered not taking it. So i have been having ""withdrawals"" for 3 days now and they havent given at all. I hope this doesnt last much longer! "

At first there were some side effects like headache, hot flashes, and a couple of extreme panic attacks.  Those went away within the 1st week.  Now I have vivid nightmares but still sleep well.  I feel great overall.  I am a full time working mom of 3 and working on my master's degree.  I feel great. No more panic attacks. No more aches and pains or worries.  I am worried about coming off the meds when the time is right, but feel great. This is my first time taking any meds for this.  The most of anything I've taken is an antibiotic. It's great. I keep in contact with my doc with check ups, and the current lowest dose works for me.  It was difficult for me to admit I was having anxiety and panic attacks. good luck to all

My Dr took me off SLOWLY changing the dose every two weeks (2wks at 150/75 alt days, 2 wks at 75/day, 2 wks at 75/37.5 alt days, 2wks at 37.5/day, 2 wks at 37.5/nothing alt days, then off) I have now been Effexor freevfor one full week and I am still suffering from withdrawl symptoms that seem to be getting worse by the day.  I didn't have a problem with the withdrawl symptoms while transitioning until now.  I'm dizzy, my brain feels like its swimming, and my sleep schedule just depends on the day  (sometimes I can sleep sometimes I can't).  Being a nurse I realize that taking medication that alter mood and all that will have withdrawl symptoms but I NEVER realized that anything could be this bad.  The medication worked and served its purpose (without side effects) while taking it but I suggest talking to your doctor about what happens down the road when you try to get off.  Unfortunatley you never know how your body will react until that time comes but maybe there are other medications out there that are easier to transition off of without feeling like a zombie!  Hope this helps!

I was having unwanted thoughts and fears that I knew didn't make any sense. I was so anxious to the point where I could no longer take it. So I decided to seek advice from a PA and he prescribed me Effexor XR 35mg. At first I did other things to try to avoid medication, such as herbal supplements, but those didn’t last all day. One day I was so sad that I decided to go ahead and take the medication. What do I have to lose... This is only my faith day and I really do notice a difference. I no longer feel depressed or worried about things that don't make sense and I finally feel like myself again. I am very hopeful that I am going to feel even better after a few weeks when the medication really gets in my system. I am thankful to god! This gave me hope! And peace of mind! Good Luck and hold on you all can do!

2947$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$3/10/2009 10:02:09 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$4$3$"I took a small dose (75mg) of Effexor, but for only a month. I heard a lot of bad things about it, but decided to go ahead and try it. The beginning was hard because of the side effects, (couldn't sleep, felt sick to my stomach, jaw clinching) I started out at 37.5mg, but after about 7-10 days moved to 75mg. As soon as I started the 75mg dose, I lost complete desire for sex and could not have an orgasm. That was it for me. I then decided to ween myself off of it. Again, read many bad things about going off the drug. I fortunately didn't have too many problems. I decreased my dose to 37.5 mg for a week from the 75 and experienced a little clinching of the jaw and maybe a little light-headedness. I'm now 4 days off completely. The only thing I notice is I'm having trouble sleeping at night. I am sure this will wear off soon. The good thing, my sexual desire is back. So overall the dug may have been fine if it didn't have the sexual side effect, and the weening off was fine as well. I may not have had any problems because I was on a low dose and only on the drug for a month. It's worth a try if you are wondering if it'll work for you. But if it doesn't, then I recommend going off of it sooner than later. 

PS. I read to take Fish Oil supplements and Super B complex while weening off, which I did. 

Hope this helps....

I have taken Cymbalta and Buspar and neither of them have worked as well as this.  I think everyone is different and you should listen to your dr. when he/she prescribes something.  Maybe this isn't right for everyone.  I take 37.5 mg a day.  My dr. said that I could easily go to 75 mg a day, since that is the usual dose but I feel like this works for me.  At least for now.  I still have minor anxiety but nothing like I had before.  I have missed a dose now and then and when I do my biggest complaint is nightmares.  I realize when I decide to stop taking Effexor that I will experience awful side effects, but I think all medications have this.  When I went off of Cymbalta (took it for 6 months) I had brain zaps, dizziness, and other terrible symptoms that took a few months to get through.  But I did get through it.  This works for me now and I will continue to use it as long as I feel the need.  If your dr. recommends it, try it to see if it right for you.

3145$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/7/2009 11:18:18 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$2$1$I started taking this medicine in 1999 and had no side effects ever. I got off of it in 2005 and was fine after weaning off for just a week from 75 mg to 35mg to nothing. Then I got pregnant and had my daughter in 2007 and I was fine for like three months, then started to have anxiety. I went back on effexor. I started with 150 mg then went to 75 4 months later. I did fine ecxept I was tired alot. Then about six months after that, only being on it less then a year, I tried to get off it. I took 35mg for 2 weeks and was fine. Then boom, it just hit me. This medicine is a nightmare to get off of. I had severe nausea, brain zaps, dizziness,crying,fear.etc. I just tried to get off it again in Nov 2008 with no sucess. Sme thing happened. I dont know why I was ok getting off it in 2005 but not now. Why is it different? It has helped me alot with anxiety, but it is horrible to get off. The withdrawls are unbearable. I would not recommend this medicine to anyone!!!

I've just finished my second month of withdrawl down from 75mg to 0 mg of effexor. The last 4 or 5 days have turned out to be worse than any other. A lot of back and forth feelings of neverousness and calmness (it's more like my nerves are becoming more active, in a very unconfortable way, and directly reacting to the change in my body chemistry (Effexor withdrawl?). These nerveous reactions  do not seem to be related to my state of mind or thought process they just change directions at ramdom. There are periods when my nervious system calms down and I feel just fine. I have to admit the last few days (not counting today) I all most gave up, I believe the Effexor web site said it takes up to 3 months to clear out of your system so I plan to ride out the whole 3 months and decide then.
On one hand if I go back on the effexor I face nite terrors (screaming in my sleep, diving out of bed, waking up with bumps and bruses and having little or no memory of the event)(my wife and kids tell me about it in the morning) (my wife sleeps in a different bed room so she avoids any injury). On effexor, I have no memory of having any normal dreams. To be honest I love having  normal dreams (not nightmares) over the past two months, since I've been off effexor. I'm done for now and need to take a break.      "

I've taken it for so many years. I've tried to stop, but can't. I have dizziness really bad and just don't feel right the times of i've tried. I feel depressed but dare not up the dosage any higher then 75mg. I would have to take off work to come off of this drug. I have a hard time becoming sexually aroused and thats when i'm lucky enough to feel like sex. Bottom line, it took care of one thing but brought on new issues. I wish I could go away for about 3 months and get off of this stuff to see who i am again.

I lost all ability to have a spontaneous erection and performance on command was extremely difficult. About 1 year ago I successfully attempted to decrease my dose down to 75 mg over several months with little side effects, my sexuall function improved as I decreased the dose. When I tried to advance from 75mg down to 37.5mg I felt a mild form of intermitant Anxiety, started to have/remember  nightmarish dreams and desided to regroup at 75mg for several more months. At the begining of November 08 I decided to go from 75mg to 0. After a nite or two I started to have/remember my dreams and still do after about 30 days no nightmares that I can recall and I 've had my first natural spontaneous erection since starting effexor 5 years ago. The down sides: the first 8 to 10 days I was extremely emotional I mean I cried at sad car tunes, movies it was embarrassing but that went away after 10 days: I also had unusual sounds in my head (kinda hard to describe WHAAA Whaaa?)that disapeared after 10 days also. The last few days (27th to 29th I've started to have(unprompted by any events) intermittent,very mild anxiety, alternating with spells of peace and calm and last for several minuntes each and then disapate. I don't know how long withdrawal last, any feed back on that? Some people have mentioned it takes months. I hope not.

I have ran out before and 2 two days later, my lips were numb, my brain was pausing, and I felt like I was outside of myself. I may only live another couple of days, because it can be fatal to just stop taking it. My insurance is gone and I do not have 180.00 to 225.00 dollars to have it refilled.  Before County cancelled my coverage, my perscriptions were only $1.00.  Anybody have any ideas as to what I can do about the Dr. who also let me go, (the one that gave me the scrip)who said she can't help me since my coverage was cancelled.  It sure seems like she would be responsible to at least try to contact the County Health Dept. to explain to them that she put me on meds that I JUST CANNOT STOP TAKING WITHOUT BECOMING A FATALITY. i MEAN DOES IT SEEM LIKE SHE WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MY LIFE ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE PHONE CALL, JUST TO COVER MY PERSCRIPTIONS OR EXTEND MY COVERAGE UNTIL SHE CAN WEEN ME OFF EFFEREX XR oral?"

BUT with Effexor, I got anxiety episodes - when I would worry about global warming, wars, weather -, vivid dreams/ nightmares which make Stephen King's books look like bedtime stories, debilitating physical symptoms - I would have to stay in bed for hours. Scarier though are the emotional and cognitive symptoms.I would feel like a stranger in my own body, in my own house and even in my own life. I never did drugs - but all the symptoms I have on Effexor are very close to what I imagine someone feels when stoned. BUT THE WORST IS I STARTED DRINKING - AND I NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD THIS PROBLEM. I FELT IN MY GUT THAT I AM NOT AN ALCOHOLIC, BUT COULDN'T EXPLAIN BEYOND THIS. AND I STARTED SMOKING AGAIN, ALTHOUGH I QUITTED 9 YR AGO. I want off this drug ASAP - anxiety and panic attacks are nothing compared to the living hell this med got me in.

THis medication has really leveled me out and yes, I am not nearly as emotional but I feel so much more in control.  The bad parts of this med is there's no generic, and if you miss a dose you get a dizzy, wacked-out feeling.

I am taking Prozac in hopes that it will help with the withdrawal symptoms. I'm on day two and the brain zaps aren't too bad, but the emotional impact I feel from the withdrawal is overwhelming. I hope anyone reading this will try to get off this HORRIBLE NARCOTIC and try something else that may help with the withdrawal. I have been on Prozac before and never had any problems before, so I sure hope this works. My prayers to all of you that are suffering, this drug NEVER shoulf have been placed on the market. If you can, try Prozac to wean, I am on my second day and am down to 37.5 from 150 mg per day. W/O the Proazc, I would get the brain zaps after only ONE hour of not taking Effexor 150mg. I will keep you updated, keep trying everyone! If no one takes this horrible drug and we warn enough people, they will no longer make any money off of it! DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!

I was on it for about a month and quit taking it all at once. I didnt have any of the symptoms of withdrawal others had except for the dizziness. I hated this med. It made me feel nauseated ALL the time. The sight or smell of food made me cringe. I lost 15 pounds, but this is not a good way to lose weight. I didnt want to leave the house. I am a very social person, but Effexor made me dread going anywhere. It helped me with anxiety but it made me not care about anything. I was completely emotionless. I didnt want to go anywhere, talk to anyone, or even eat. All I wanted to do was sleep or lay in the bed. NOT worth it!

It has changed me. I am a more positive worry free person. I don't get afraid anymore. I used to have bad nervous panic attacks. I could not deal with negative and stressful issues at work. Now i am more livelier (my co-workers have noticed), I laugh more. Joke more and feel so much more RELAXED. Social gatherings are so much easier to be in. My hangups and fears are no minimal. 
As for side effects I did have headaches and blurred vision. Seems like the have subsided.. I only take the medication when I am ""PMS""ing. I don't take it on a daily basis and my body does not feel side effect from that. 
Everyone is different Physiologically and tht is what we must understand!!!"

3659$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/20/2008 2:47:22 PM$Reviewer: Concerned, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$4$When I first began Effexor XR 37.5 dose I was sick and unable to sleep but I noticed that I was improving emotionally. Then I progressed to the 75 dose I began experiencing fatigue and headaches; but I was beginning to feel more at ease and had better concentration and I was ready for the 150 dose, according go my doctor. When on the  150 dose I was at times experiencing extreme fatigue and weight gain, along with headaches and chronic constipation. However, I was extremely happy with the results in the beginning. I had self confidence that I never had before and was convinced that I would use this drug forever. I was calm and level headed and for once liked myself. Over a period of time I noticed my growing dependence on this drug. My weight gain was out of control and I bruised very easily. My self confidence turned into aggression that raged out of control. My family would not accompany me anywhere during this time because my temper was out of control and I would 'mouth off' to anyone who looked at me wrong. Then the dizzy spells started to occur and nightmares started. It has been a long road to hell and back trying to get off this drug. I will succeed in getting my life and family back. I'm now at the 75 dose again and my body is craving more Effexor - it's unreal. Next week I'll try to cut the dose to 37.5 but I am afraid because of all the hell I'm going through to get off these pills. Effexor XR will make a 'junkie' out of you - just because it's legal doesn't make it any better than the illegal street drugs. The symptoms are the same and it can eventually ruin your life.

I realized I needed to be treated for depression when I was in my early 30's. I finally went to a doctor and asked for help. After trying some different medications and dosages we finally decided on Wellbutrin XL 450mg with Effexor XR 225mg. I've been on this for about 2 years. IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID! My anxiety and anger was gone after a few weeks. I stopped fighting with my husband and co-workers everyday. I was able to take difficult situations in stride. The worst side effect was dry mouth. I will say that after reading some of these reviews I'm terrified to ever go off of the Effexor XR.

I just wanted to share, to let you all know there is an end to the agonizing withdrawal symptoms, you just have to tough it out. Besides that, I loved the medication and would recommend it to anyone with anxiety or depression. It worked wonders for me and its to bad the weigh gain made decide to stop taking it.

It calmed me and took the edge off, so to speak.  BUT, jumping from 125 lbs to 155 lbs and having none of my scrubs to fit any longer and looking ""puffy""--its not the drug of choice for me.  I have NEVER had a ""weight"" problem...so this is very new and difficult for me--its a puffy, bloated look..very noticable in photos.  I am coming off of it as I type this.  I need it, but will consult dr. for something else.  Funny thing is, I read in the article on this site that Effexor  was one that didn't cause weight gain...NOT TRUE.  I have, and so have several of my friends who are on it and trying to stop it.  I wouldn't recommend it. "

I was so nauseaous I couldn't properly take care of my kids. Crackers & water did help the nausea, but I felt very heavy, over-tired, I was clenching my jaw A LOT, got the chills bad & had quivers. I took a 75mg dose & I've never taken any other kind of drug before. My doc failed to tell me about the commoness/severity of the nausea.

I have tried Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and Prozac but they just didn't do the trick.  Effexor XR has made me a new person with zero side effects.  I felt better from the first day I started the 37.5 dose and I'm now at 75. Along with ALL my symptoms being relieved, I have the added benifit of reduced hunger and carb cravings.  For the first time in a long time, I don't obsess over food, feel like I'm starving even though I just ate or only feel satisfied eating high carb things.  I sleep better and wake up refreshed.  I've never felt so normal and productive in my life!  I'm drinking more water, I'm more motivated which means more active and in 2 weeks, I've lost 7 pounds without much effort or depriving myself. I've read all the horror stories on the net and just thought this medicine needed some positive feedback.  Just because it gave you some horrible side effects doesn't mean it's bad.  It just means its not for you.  Please don't use scare tactics to keep someone from trying it as it could change their life they way it has mine.  I am aware of the withdrawal symptoms but because I feel so much better, I look forward to taking my pill in the morning so I don't miss a dose and I never plan on going off of it.

I have loved everything about the medication. I have generalized anxiety disorder as well as social anxiety. I have had these symptoms my entire life but I started to have frequent panic attacks, so I started to take this medication. (I have tried several other prescriptions but this one worked wonders for me!) 
I now suffer less anxiety attacks, I have become more outgoing and less nervous in social situations and my mild depression has diminished. The down side to this was the fact that I have gain a significant amount of weight (25lbs) while taking Effexor and decided about two months ago that I wanted to try life without it. I have been having the worst withdrawals!! I started to take it every other day and would feel constantly slightly dizzy throughout the day. But I pushed through it and it is now IMPOSSIBLE to try and take it every three days. My body is physically addicted to this medication! I can not explain how awful the withdrawl symptoms are. My head feels fuzzy along with my vision, I have awful headaches and feel so dizzy it makes me extremely nauseous. I just lost my insurance and had to pay $150.00 for the prescription because I can't make it three days without taking it.

I just thought I was just an emotional person. But when uncontrollable crying started to occur for no apparent reason, I sought help. It was effecting my job, my family, and my activity level. I found myself opting out of social engagements simply because I never knew when I would break into tears.
I've been taking 37.5 dosage of Effexor for 2 years. I was worried that I would be emotionally dead. But that hasn't occurred. I still find myself in unexplained emotional moments, but now I can get it under control. My family life, work life, and social life have dramatically improved. I'm no longer the introvert that I had become.
I do have very vivid dreams, but no problem sleeping. I did gain weight, so I increased the length of my daily walking routine and that helped. I have noticed less sex drive, but now that my husband and I recognize what's causing it, we're able to work through it with no problems. I do get hot flashes, but I'm learning how to deal with that, too. 
All in all, I'm a much happier, even-tempered person. It's a relief. Effexor is simply be a part of my life from now on."

I'm not sure if my anxiety causes my depression or the other way around. But I've been dealing with both for many years. I began Effexor XR at the lowest dosage, then increased to 75. Used that dosage for a year. Just recently increased to 150. The reason I tried the increase was because of anxiety. At 75, it helped with most of my depression symptoms. However, I still needed to sometimes take Ativan for anxiety attacks. At 150, Effexor seems to be helping with my anxiety problems as well. I would not take drugs for mental health unless my situation was serious. I have two children, marriage and a full-time job.  With help, I can handle it all.

I am always sweating, feel shaky, I can't sleep anymore... I am a mess. I am experiencing feelings I have never felt before. 

I know these drugs are not overnight wonders... I know I will not feel better overnight. But I also know, I shouldn't be feeling as worse as I am. After reading all of the comments, I have made an appointment with my Dr. I need to be taken off of this ASAP!!! The side effects are just making me feel worse. I feel like hell."

I have experienced EXTREMELY HORRIBLE side affects. My brain feels like I have an electrical shortage (7 days--continuously). My family is falling apart because they CANNOT help me. I hurt all over--from head to toe. These ""jolts"" in my brain make me feel awful, which naturally alters my mood because there is NOTHING that can be done to take this away! Not to mention that after I started taking Effexor XR several years ago, it decreased my sex drive; resulting in difficulty having an orgasm (something I did not have a problem with before taking Effexor)!  I have no desire for sex, even though I find my husband so very sexy! Additionally, I struggle with constipation; have abnormal dreams; weight loss was great (at the beginning) but not withstanding; my cholesterol and blood pressure have been up and down like my weight; and I forget a lot details and dates (something that is not conducive to my family or profession). There are times I feel like in my effort to try to minimize my anxiety, I developed something much worse—an Effexor XR addiction!  If you plan to stop taking Effexor XR abruptly, I strongly urge you to consider the side affects (withdrawal symptoms) with your doctor. I do not know how long this will last, but I am fighting it--barely. I feel completely helpless against these symptoms, and I do not ever want to go through this again."

I live my days very calm now, and my relationships don't suffer anymore. I can't imagine going back to those extreme highs and lows.  The only thing I worry about are the long term effects - I would eventually like to trial a 'natural' solution, but for now I won't risk the contentment.

Dr. tried once to take me off it by gradually decreasing dose and then taking one Prozac on the last day. Had the common withdrawl symtoms and the anxiety came back.

I tried Zoloft first, and it was great for the anxiety, but gave me the attention span of a gnat.  Unlike most of these reviewers, I take it at night, because it makes me sleepy (it has really helped me sleep well, actually).  I am weaning off the Klonopin now, because the XR has been really effective.  I have not experienced sexual side effects or weight gain on this drug - the only noticable side effect I've had is dry mouth - and that just makes me drink more water, which is good for you anyway.  

The best thing I've done besides the medication for anxiety is quitting the caffeine entirely.  If you have any kind of panic or anxiety disorder, this is probably the best thing you can do for yourself after getting medical help!  And even though I am not very ""new agey"", I've taken up Kundalini Yoga, which focuses primarily on breathing (good for when you're feeling anxious) and Hatha Yoga (which is great for relieving stress).  Try it, you'll like it! 

While I was happy with the zoloft besides being a bit flighty, this just goes to show that if the first drug you try doesn't work, there are others to try - don't give up!  Be honest with your doctor, and you WILL find something that helps you!"

I tried Zoloft and Celexa before being put on this and neither had the effect the effexor has. To those who have been on depression anxiety medication that hasn't help, ask your Dr. to switch you, it's worth trying more than one kind.  It's been a godsend for me.

AND they say that it is not addicting, well explain to me why I have to be tapered off slowly.  I was taking 225 mg per day and for the last couple day down to 150mg.  Nausea, dizzy, etc. They also had me on Risperdal at bedtime, so I am going through withdrawals from that also.  If I ever get off this med.....no more for me.  Doctors should take it for a few months and then try to go off to experience the side affects.  I have had BAD headaches every since I started this stupid med.  I just pray to God that I can get off this med and stay off.  If you are going through similar side effects, I feel for you and understand.  Oh, by the way, I was on .25 of risperdal and they took me off cold turkey.  How can the FDA approve such mean drugs?!?!

4328$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/20/2007 1:31:33 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I already wrote a positive review of this drug, but after reading other reviews I thought I should add something about the withdrawal symptoms. With Effexor, it is VERY IMPORTANT to continue taking the medication. The withdrawal is terrible!!! One a few occasions for one reason or another I've found myself without my pills for a few days and it was awful. The withdrawal symptoms start within 48 hours and it's so hard to describe. To borrow from another reviewer...It's like your life is a slow motion movie. I start to get a little paranoid and VERY panicky. I am a little nervous about ever going off this medicine because of that. When I go off my pills, I feel completely out of it. Just remember that when starting treatment - this is not a drug to be taken only every few days.

I was dealing with high anxiety and a little fear of social situations, and within a year I was feeling 100% better. I've been on 225 mg a day for the past 5 years. Recently, we also added 20 mg of Buspar because I seem to be overly anxious at night. If it weren't for this medicine, I'd be a complete basketcase. Stick with it! The first year was tough for me as we changed my dose about 6 times. At first I felt super loopy, but now I'm very happy with the results.

It took away all my emotion. I wouldn't cry when I was sad, and I wouldn't laugh when I was happy. It was wierd. I do not experience this with Effexor. I like that it helps with my anxiety without affecting my personality. I have experienced weight gain, but that has really been the only side effect. One thing i am worried about, is ever trying to get off this med. I have heard the withdrawal symptoms are insane. I have experienced wierd effects if I skip a dose; i.e. nausea, sensations in my brain (hard to explain), and the anxiety returns.

I would continually have horrible nightmares, or even night terrors.  Every morning, I would wake up in a pool of sweat.  One recommendation I would give is if you decide this medication isn't the right one for you, make sure you talk to your doctor and set up a plan to slowly go off of Effexor...the withdrawal symptoms are really intense.
4363$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/12/2007 4:04:06 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"While taking effexor xr, I have been able to attend class, I am a senior in college, and also go into public spaces without freaking out. I am on 150mg in the morning, since when I used to take it at bedtime I would not be able to sleep so now I take it in the morning. I also take xanax ""as needed"". I have not experienced any sexual side effects, and my appetite has not increased or decreased, just stayed steady and I have in fact lost weight with this med. I am moving up to 225mg, just to try and make it so I don't have ""bad days"" as often as I do now, which is about once a week. I used to take lexapro and with that I didn't want to have sex ever and gained weight like crazy. For me, effexor xr is great, the only bad thing is if I miss a dose I also have flu like symptoms, which involve a horrible upset stomach and dizziness, but it goes away after a day. "

I was previously on Zoloft which was working, but I felt that I did not need medication for depression anymore, just anxiety.  I have had a few classic symptoms of Effexor. I can't say ""loss"" of apetite, but definitely a noticeable decrease, blurry vision, drowsiness and dry mouth all the time.  I also have had pain in both shoulders and backs of my arms that I cannot attribute to anything else.  "

Worked okay but I was never professionally diagnosed  with anxiety/depression before i started taking effexor. I was probably considered average by most professionals regarding levels of anxiety.  My family doctor put me on this med after I told her I get anxious at times and I wish i could go back in time and stopped myself from taking a brain altering med that my family doctor prescribed.  Not only was the weight gain horrible but the loss in sex drive drove me insane.  I finally decided to go off but the withdrawal was so horrible, i considered going back on this drug.  I had the usual side effects, brain zaps, etc.  But the emotional withdrawal symptoms is what is so devasting. I find myself crying and screaming when i'm alone and I have never ever had this problem pre-drug.  Please please, don't take this drug unless a trained counselor or doctor prescribes this and after much evaluation, finds this to be the correct route.  Family doctors aren't trained to see the signs of depression and anxiety.  My life is an absolute mess now and hopefully once all of the drug is out of me, i can lead a normal life.

I was taking Xanax at the same time. I had to stop taking Effexor as it caused central nervous system depression, which if you take this type of combination long enough it can be fatal from my research. I stopped the drug after two days. Symptoms of central nervous system depression include: extreme drowsiness, losing your balance, pains in the back of your head, extreme mobility problems, extreme state of confusion.The only anti-depressants I would recommend based on my own experience to be used with any of the benzodiazepines(xanax,klonopin,ativan,librium,etc .) would be Zoloft or Remeron(mirtazapine).

I was on it and all it did was cause weight gain, but coming off is hell.  Once you're on it, plan on staying on for life.  I've tried to come off this for three months, and went off the lowest dose two weeks ago.   I'm so dizzy I can't drive, can't work, and overall my quality of life is reduced to the point where I don't want to live anymore.   So, before taking any med please google effexor withdrawals, it may save your life.

It seems to be relatively effective. I have full medical insurance, yet the cost to fill my Effexxor has never been less than $97.00. Personally, I find that overly expensive. Most importantly, I'd caution any and everyone considering taking Effexxor to research its side effects beforehand. Personally, I found the side effects to be nothing short of nightmarish. I 'm very regimented about taking my Effexxor every day at roughly the same time everyday. On the rare occassion that I missed a dose, let's say on a Tuesday morning; by Wednesday morning & CERTAINLY by Wednesday evening, I am completely nauseous, my equilibrium is totally off kilter, my pupils begin to dilate, then decrease down to the size of a ""pin dot"", and alternate back & forth until I am able to take my next dose. I become extremely dizzy, and was literally afraid to drive my car. The side effects are so fierce, that I have only missed a dose perhaps 3 times in 5 years. Even then, it was a result of me unexpectedly having to stay overnight out of town on business - or some other extinuating circumstance. I don't mean to be disparaging, I'm simply an advocate of self education re: psychotherapeutic meds because every person reacts differently to any drug & often times, physicians can't quite fathom the toll certain aspects of certain drugs have on our personal health and lifestyle."

Zero sex drive and big weight gain.  Was on 150 mg and it took the edge off.  Weaned off them and went through the normal withdrawal symptoms, brain shivers, random crying fits, and irritation.

I gained 25 pounds, completely lost all desire to have sex, and became depressed. I started sleeping for 12-15 hours a night, and all I wanted to eat were sweets. It did not even help my anxiety all that much. In short, it caused more problems than it solved. I went on a diet, and I didn't even start to lose weight until I went off of the medication.

In fact, it heightened it.  When i drank a mixed drink, i became an angry drunk.  I attribute the increased angriness to this drug because i haven't had a problem since i've been off it.  There is a reason why it says not to drink alcohol while taking this med.  If thats a problem for you, then i would do some additional research.  also, the weight gain was awful.  I gained 20lbs in 3 months.  I'm usually very petite and this was such a tramautizing event for me that i became more depressed.  
Overrall, just do research before this is prescribed to you.  My midwife, who has no mental health training, gave this to me. I find this absolutely irresponsible.  It ruined my life for two years and since i've been off, i feel like my old self.  "
