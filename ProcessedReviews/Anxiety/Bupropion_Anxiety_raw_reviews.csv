Other meds SSRIs had disastrous results. Good for increasing or restoring dopamine. Little to no bad sexual effects. Been on it 11+ years now retired 10 yrs. Lifesaving med for me.
31$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/1/2016 2:11:10 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$5$I was on Fluoxetine for anxiety for 8 years. Switched to Bupropion cause the Fluoxetine was decreasing my sex drive. My anxiety has returned to basically where it was before I started taking the Fluoxetine. Was prescribed Buspirone in addition to try and help more with anxiety but really hasn't helped much. Sex drive has only gotten slightly better.

39$Anxiousness associated with Depression$8/27/2015 8:59:42 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$2$I have almost tried everything, and went back on bupropion Sr 150mg then to 300mb, but still have anxiety and sweating all the time. I still have some depression and frustruated of having to take these drugs, I also exercise a lot for my mood and health. I;m thinking I will go back to 150mg to see if that makes a difference/

It's to be taken in the morning to give you a little pep and shouldn't be taken late in the afternoon or evening.  It's basically an upper.  You would sleep well taking it late.
402$Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/6/2017 1:29:44 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$25 years ago I was severely depressed, Dr put me on Prozac, it dulled my senses and mind. I  wasn't happy, couldn't get excited.  5 years later NEW Dr put me on Wellbutrin and all of that cleared up, I had energy and laughed. Now on BupropionHCI SR 100mg every morning otherwise the dark clouds start to appear.
431$Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/31/2017 3:51:56 PM$Reviewer: Nate82, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I've now been on generic Wellbutrin for 3 weeks and feel no different. I did experience some side effects at first; no appetite and nauseous for a week and a lot of dreams when sleeping. Now I'm experiencing nothing, no positives or negatives. Not sure why? I have some anxiety and depression but mainly depersonalization so maybe this isn't the right drug for me.
721$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/5/2019 11:37:49 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Worst experience of my life. Increased my anxiety to the point of panic attacks. I have never had panic attacks in my life! I was dizzy constantly, had muscle aches in my neck and back, was stressed beyond measure! Iâ€™ve been off it for 10 days and still feeling anxious and panicky. This was just awful.
732$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/9/2018 10:53:10 PM$Reviewer: Rumi, 65-74 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$This med acts like an amphetamine for the first week (hyperfocusing, inability to sleep at first, loss of appetite) but after a week of so, the effect changes; makes me very calm ,reduces anxiety, helps me sleep better than before I started taking it, increases motivation and pleasure just generally. So maybe stick with it for a few weeks before giving it up....... as it becomes very effective for me.
751$Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/5/2017 10:49:12 AM$Reviewer: Thormind, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I tried soo many medication before this one and i always had to stop because of side effects. It's the only one that works for me with abcolutely no side effect.
752$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/26/2017 8:17:47 PM$Reviewer: aruba, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$"I have panic attacks and have been on Xanax and a small dose of paxil for many years.  I've been feeling very ""spacy"" in the afternoons and my dr. and I decided to get rid of paxil and Xanax and try welb.  I started on 75 twice a day while reducing paxil and Xanax.  I increased to 150 twice a day and it was awful!!  I was hallucinating for a couple hours one day and it scared the crap out of me.  I was way overthinking things.  Scary!!  Back to 75 mg. twice a day.  Started with a cold when everyone around was sick and ended up with sinusitis.  I have been sick for 5 weeks!!  Nausea, dizzy, no taste, no smell, sinus pain, ""floaty"" head.  On antibiotics for 2 weeks and feel worse.  Called both primary and anxiety dr.s to see if it is welb or sinusitis symptoms.  Still don't know, but I was feeling great the first month!!  I want that back!!  will have to wait for sinus to go away."
764$Anxiousness associated with Depression$7/30/2016 4:22:55 PM$Reviewer: Rosalia, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I've always had anxiety but got deep depression later in my teens. I still struggle with deep depression and anxiety. Due to the depression, I was constantly fatigued and couldn't concentrate. I was always sleepy. After taking Wellbutrin, it's helped tremendously. I feel like me again. I'm no longer constantly fatigued or sleepy. Unfortunately, I can't concentrate sometimes, but most times I can. As far as side effects, my doctor later instructed for me to take the medicine in the morning because it would give me insomnia. I'm relatively small so I need to have a good meal or drink lots of water or else I can get a bad stomach ache or even throw up. I also hear ringing in my ears at times. 
767$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/22/2016 12:55:54 PM$Reviewer: Retired Soldier, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I returned from my third combat deployment in 2011, after each deployment, starting in 2004, I suffered more and more symptoms Anxiety, depression mood swings, severe anger and having to retire from the Army in 2012. Was diagnosed with PTSD. I went through the gambit of anti-depressants/anxiety medications over the years. I had major side affects to all and was down to Wellbutrin or Zoloft. Tried Wellbutrin and it had been working great, minimal side effects, up to 250mg a day. Earlier this year I had sinusitis with fluid in my ears, doctor prescribed a steroid and Augmentin. Within 3 days I had a horrible, metallic taste in my mouth. Figured it was from the new medication. It was so bad I couldn't eat and lost 12lbs in 1 1/2 weeks. I stopped the additional meds and the metallic taste has subsided, but took about 2 months to clear up. Now I have a minimal lack of taste,(best example-I can't taste chocolate) a side effect of the Wellbutrin which is all I take now. I like this medication, it has helped make me myself before Afghanistan, but why am I having this side effect now after 3 years of use? My Dr. has stepped me back to 200mg, but I am pretty much out of options for other meds. Do I keep suffering not being able to enjoy food or come of the meds and risk feeling like the world is about to explode and I have to fight my way through it?
1502$Anxiousness associated with Depression$10/3/2019 1:48:57 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  (Patient) $1$1$1$"After taking Paxil for 20 years and changing over to Welbutrin I can say that it has been a nightmare.   I've been taking Welbutrin for 28 days and I feel worse than I have ever felt in my life.  I will stick with it for the 6 weeks that my doctor has suggested I try, but this experience has been horrible.  I'm fortunate in that I am retired and can take the time I need to concentrate on my mental health.

1554$Anxiousness associated with Depression$8/16/2016 3:34:38 PM$Reviewer: Amy, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I have been taking it for appx. 3 weeks.  The first two were golden...lots of energy, my thoughts were unclouded and I felt focused for the first time in a long time. I woke up rested, not lethargic all day.  My orgasms seemed wonderfully explosive, something I hadn't experienced in years.  Another thing I liked was I would wake up at 4:00 a.m., well before my alarm.  I was on-time everywhere.  It was amazing....so I thought.  Then on the 3rd week, I had the most awful mood swings I have ever felt in my life.  I was mean, extremely agitated, I wanted to hurt people, I was so angry.  I cried over commercials, anything with music...slow or fast.  Everything was making me cry and everything was making me mad.  My appetite seemed to increase.  I couldn't control my eating.  I immediately called my doctor the next business day and she switched me right away.  I hate that it didn't work for me because I loved the energy and sex drive. But, in the end it's not worth the ""crazies"" that came along with it, for me."
1562$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/12/2016 10:45:47 AM$Reviewer: hopeful, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$In the past 2 years, I started taking SSRI's to deal with anxiousness - starting with Lexapro and then Effexor.  I gained 20 pounds very easily, completely lost my sex drive and became depressed. I did some research and I started taking the generic form of this drug while weening off of Effexor and had HORRIBLE side effects - dizziness, nausea, and a terrible itchy rash on the inside of my legs. I discontinued the generic version and have started taking Wellbutrin brand name 150 mg once a day. It's only been a couple weeks but I've noticed increased sweating (especially at night - I wake up drenched in sweat and have to change clothes) vivid scary dreams, and today some dizziness. Can anyone tell me if this will subside or if I'm just not meant to take any form of this drug?? I was really hoping to lose some weight and also treat my ADD with this so I could focus at work again. Willing to stick it out for awhile to see if the side effects go away. 
1563$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/3/2016 9:29:52 AM$Reviewer: MC, 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I suffered from major anxiety and depression.  First given Zoloft and I had felt like a zombie and all I wanted to do is sleep. Stopped this horrible drug after 4 weeks and Dr gave me Wellbutrin.  The start up side effects were hard but well worth the wait. TYOU NEED TO GIVE THE MED A FULL 6 to 8 WEEKS TO WORK  Started feeling better after 2 weeks but felt the full effects in 7 weeks - Well worth the wait. .  No more depression and very little anxiety.  I did take .5 mg of Klononpin at start up to help with the anxiety.  After 8 weeks I no longer need the Klonopin and this drug is a mircle drug for me
