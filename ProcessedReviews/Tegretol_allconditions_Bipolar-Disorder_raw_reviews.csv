Regular blood test are a must, and I have been  lucky and my levels are fine.  I wonder after being on this RX for this long if the body becomes immune and will eventually stop working...hope not.

It's worked well, doesn't prevent down feelings but seems to help limit them. After 3 years, am starting to notice short-term memory loss.  Whenever I tried 150 mg, I felt slightly sluggish and fatigue, so backed down to 100.  My doctor is surprised that the low dose is effective.

I’m taking 100mg in the morning and 100mg in the evening. I’m also taking 20mg of adderall RX in the morning. Ever since I started to take the tegretol I feel very fatigued. I find myself fighting to stay awake about 45 minutes after taking tegretol and at times I end up taking a 30 to 45 min cat nap after taking it in the morning.  Although it has be a very short time taking this medication I’m hoping this does not lead to long term side affects with the fatigue and drowsiness. I would of thought the adderall would of counter acted any of the sedation affects of tegretol but so far it has no affect at all Over all I do feel much better taking tegretol but hate these two side affects I’m currently experiencing. .

had the least side effects, quickest adjustment time and smoothest stability.

I am glad to be alive after taking it. It was prescribed for Panic Disorder to me and it will sure stop a panic attack because at the dosage I got,you will be crawling on your knees. Not good.Even the people it helped are going to suffer even more in the end.Sorry to pop your bubbles if I did but it's the truth.

The medicine works great with stabilizing my moods and the only problem I have is when I had either ran out of it or stopped taking it and had to go through withdrawls.  This medicine took over having to take lithium.  
413$Manic-Depression$1/6/2008 10:39:51 PM$Reviewer: celticmaiden, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$4$Tegretol seems to help me identify my depression from periods when I'm manic; this helps because knowing what mode I'm in, I can treat the symptoms of depression like not being too hard on myself, knowing my limitations, accepting them, be kind to myself, make sure that I eat. When I realize that I'm manic, I treat the symptoms by taking a walk to release increased energy & journaling to purge myself of racy thoughts. I still cycle about every 2 weeks, and I have terrible problems with irritablity & anger management. Whether manic or depressed, its all about self-care. Before taking tegretol, I was in a state of constant chaios because I didn't understand what was happening with my mind. I thought I was either going crazy or just being carefree; I couldn't understand why I couldn't keep a job and such. The only side effect I feel I have is fatigue. Tegretol does not do alot to control my manic-deppresive episodes; there are times I feel like I could crawl out of my skin, my head reels, and things seem so surreal or I get so depressed that I don't get out of bed for a couple of days feeling catatonic. Like I stated before, the tegretol does help me identify my mood swings somewhat and that helps.

447$Manic-Depression$7/2/2013 10:38:43 AM$Reviewer: april, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $1$1$5$I was given this medication, suffered severe side affects which caused damage on all my major organs(calcification),muscle tissue,bone tissue, pain so bad I loss the use of my legs, needed to use a wheel chair. Doctor told me I had lupus,limphnoma and about 10 years to live.  sold my house, gave away money and lost it all only to find out it was the medication. I stopped the medication after doing research that said this medication can cause lupus like symptoms. Although, I have permanent damage and I've lived another 17 years since the doc. told me I only had 10, I work and am off disability, remarried, walk, go biking, dancing, hiking, etc. Take an active roll in your health care, ask questions and keep a journal of you new meds. and any and all symptoms. God Bless.

486$Manic-Depression$9/17/2009 6:10:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I've been taking it for about 2 yrs and I often have numbness in my fingers that I never had before. My docter was trying to slowly take me off the 800 mg I take, but even though I'm on 2 other mood stabilizers, the mood swings were horrible. I really want to reduce the 6 meds I take but this has proved pretty difficult to get off. I also wish it caused the drowsiness other people claim to have, because I have severe insomnia. I'm just even more thirsty, but I guess it helps keep me a little more stable.

In the beginning it was hard to say the least. Not going to lie....  Those side effect were AWFUL.  I had every last side effect, you name it I had it.. except it has never made me tired. The dry mouth was by FAR THE WORST.  If you can get through those side effects which don't last forever. Mine pretty much disapeared within a month or so...the worst ones disapearing first I must add.  I would highly recomend it for the treatment of someone trying to cope with bipolar at the end of a short rope.  I have tried ALL the bipolar meds out there in every combo you can dream up except lithium and depakote...so I've circled the block a few times and this is deff worth a try.

I had a break in use due to a switch in Ins. companies (I was off this drug for about 3 months) and I have been back on it for about 2.5 months now and I am having severe headaches, as well as the typical loss of interest in sex and lack of orgasm intensity.  I am not sure this med is working this time around? I often have dbl vision or blurred vision or I have to ""re-focus"" whenever I am trying to read things. I may have to switch meds?"
533$Manic-Depression$11/8/2007 5:34:18 PM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$I started taking tegretol and the next day started to have double vision. I tried to wait it out, but it just got worse. I stopped and restarted the medicine to see if it would do better a second time around and it just put me to sleep. It ruined my birthday.
