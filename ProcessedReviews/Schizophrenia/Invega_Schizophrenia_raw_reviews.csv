19$Schizophrenia$1/19/2012 12:35:35 PM$Reviewer: Me83oN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$3$I went through a period of sycosis from end of January 2011 - March or April 2011. Started getting the shot in March I think and in a month or 2 the sycosis subsided. Been on it now for almost a year and haven't heard any voices that aren't really there or seen anything that isn't really there. This was probally my 5th time having sycosis. This time I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I haven't really noticed any side effects. Except for I had lost some wieght then gained 20 lbs back and I am making alot of the hormone that you have when you are pregnant but am not pregnant. That causes me to produce milk. When I first started getting the shot I was scared. Getting the shot in the arm hurts for a few days afterward. The hip doesn't really hurt at all. 
20$Schizophrenia$9/1/2010 9:10:00 AM$Reviewer: pyper1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$My experience with this drug has been short, but in that time I have found it to and effective option when the oral medication fails to alleviate the symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, symptoms in particular audio and visual hallucinations.
21$Schizophrenia$10/29/2019 11:12:40 PM$Reviewer: Lewis, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$"I have gained 65lbs, have high cholesterol, extremely high triglycerides, high liver enzymes, high blood pressure, high Prolactin, and prediabetes all because of Invega. In 2 1/2 years I was never told about my blood work nor was I refered to my primary care physician until I was at ""very high risk of a stroke or heart attack at any moment"". I filed a complaint with Janssen, the manufacturer, and the FDA for a bad and dangerous drug."
26$Schizophrenia$9/12/2016 3:50:59 AM$Reviewer: wowinvega, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I wouldn't wish this drug on my worst nightmare. Pretty sure it destroyed my ability to have orgasms and gave me severe anxiety -uncontrolled movements, etc. Only when I stopped taking the drug and it had a chance to exit my system did this TERRIBLE anxiety subside! I feel like my brain has been re-wired, having zero interest in sex, or possibly even being able to reach climax impossible. Yes it did help with hallucinations, but NOT WORTH IT IN MY BOOK!

After read all these reviews, it make me more comfortble and at eased to give him a try.  I also found the link with 84% discount from the Invega, hope it will help.

33$Schizophrenia$4/1/2014 10:20:28 AM$Reviewer: Micky Lagoski, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I was diagnosed with ""schizophrenia"" at the age of 35, so quite late. Invega (6mg) makes the voices in my head completely disappear or preventing them. Besides, bizarre delusions, like equipment that can read your mind, are eliminated. Taking Invega gives you a calm mind, thoughts don't ramble. Furthermore angry feelings  are decreased. Because of the gradually and continuous release of the medicine (new release system), one doesn't feel a drug boost - drugged. Now the side-effects : I need more sleep, sleep longer. I feel tired, less fit. Taking Invega for the first time might give you nightmares. And you might drool when you get higher doses. Sometimes a light headache can occur more frequently. When you stop with Invega (or Risperdal) I experienced a little bit of strange movements with tongue/mouth/jaws. This stopped after a few months. And I think I got heartburn (reflux problems) from it. Invega is very effective diminishing the positive symptoms. But I'm not sure about it, when it comes to negative symptoms. Invega makes me lazy, and less motivated - indifferent. I'm not sure about the following fact, but I think it's true : Risperdal gave me a bit of depersonalized feeling (increased it) - like there was a (virtual glass) barrier between me and the outside world (""cloud"" in my head). Invega, resembles Risperdal, but didn't gave me that depersonalization / derealization feeling at all!! I don't feel completely OK yet, but for now Invega provides me with the means to manage my life quite well, without help from other people. 3 mg Invega as maintenance dose is still quite effective. I still long for a complete recovery, although extremely rare when one has schizophrenia. "

45$Schizophrenia$11/25/2012 2:34:35 PM$Reviewer: SoundSystem, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$4$"Current maintenance dosage 3 mg (was 6mg) Invega. After taking Invega my positive symptoms vanished completely after a 
number of weeks, furthermore I don't get an unreal sense (depersonalization) which was the case with Risperdal. Unfortenately I got the following side-effects (discussed with my physician):

- weight gain (8 kilo's)
- sometimes strange expression around 
  mouth, stiffness
- tiredness/weakness, need more sleep
- intense dreaming, sometimes nightmares
- harder to breath through nose
- increase of ALAT blood values (80)
- dizziness after sudden activity

For now the positive effects outweight the negative effects.

Found out the hard way I cannot take Tylenol Cold Medicine while on this drug. Made me swell in the feet, ankles, and hands. Went away in 4 hours, so not bad.

I feel relief when I take this medication after missing a dose.  My thinking becomes clear again, and my agitation goes away completely.  I took Risperdal for many years before this, and I've found that they both work well.  I'm a male and I haven't had any of the side effects that are listed except for the weight gain.  I try to stay on the Mediterranean diet, which keeps my weight just within the normal range.

Seems to help stop the talking, but the figures are still present. Still paranoid, still having negative symptoms. Not as agitated as before, but still easily agitated from little things. Still get confused. Haven't noticed any weight gain that can't be attributed to the holidays.

Makes me kind of sleepy a couple hours after I take it, but if I'm kept busy and thinking and moving, I don't fall asleep.

We'll see how it goes on 6 mg."

I was put on a drug called Serentil and was on it for over 25 years. I took 50mg per day. I was fine all my adult life then they stopped making the drug.  I tried everything-Geodon-Seroquel-Resperdal-Melleril and others.  Nothing worked.  Finally I changed docs and he put me on Invega-3mg-didn't work then 6mg-better but still not the best then 9mg-great.  No more voices and I don't have any side effects.  Only problem is over the 3 years of trying different meds I developed constant anxiety. My doc put me on Xanax ER.  Which may not be the best for someone who used to use drugs but, I haven't used since age 20 and I'm 47 now.  No side effects with Xanax ER either. And I still have slight anxiety but, I live with it.  As for the weight gain  on Invega I don't have it but, I have a very physical job so that may have something to do with it.  I also tried Depakote and gained 25# in 2 months.  The most important thing is no voices and I can live a ""normal"" life.  After 3 years of trying Thank God for Invega."

204$Schizophrenia$7/27/2015 3:33:02 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $1$1$4$This med can be a living hell for some people.  My adult son was like a caged animal on this stuff.  He would scream, hit his head with his fist, and kick holes in the wall.  His hallucinations were so creepy that he frightened me.  Every time I'd tell the doctor how awful it was, she'd say he needs to take the next dose, then the next.  He took it 6 months.  It was the most horrible six months of our lives, not to mention all the damage done to my home.  In case you might wonder, he was not using illegal drugs and not drinking alcohol.  We recently had testing through an orthomolecular Dr and learned that my son is under methylated (high histamine) and zinc deficient.  Don't know if that had anything to do with his problem on this med.  None of the meds have worked for him, but Invega Sustenna was absolutely the worst.

206$Schizophrenia$4/9/2015 9:44:44 PM$Reviewer: elise, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $4$5$5$My 18 year old son was diagnosed with schizophrenia about a year ago. It has been a really rough ride. He has tried a lot of drugs and even this one once before. As the dosage was lowered he got worse and the voices never left anyway,so we tried other drugs. Recently we came back to this one after I read a review on this site that one reviewer's voices didn't leave until after 5 months of use. I was hopeful to try it again. And sure enough between 5-6 months the voices stopped all of a sudden! He still talks to himself a lot, but says he is just used to doing so. He watches tv and plays video games, and goes out in public more. He also takes Cogentin, which helps with eye muscle spasms which started on some of the other drugs, so he just stayed on it. Overall, I am pleased with this drug. He is taking the 234 injection every 3 weeks.

Most of his symptoms are gone so he can lead a normal life. In the past he was only sporadically taking pills but now just once a month, and he's done. Nothing is perfect he is lethargic. I notice the difference in him more than he does, but it is well worth it. Without this med his delusions would be worse and get him into trouble.

They didnt work because I always forgot to take them and so I constantly was in and out of Psychotic episodes. Felt a difference after the first injection. The voices began to quiet. Was very sleepy in the beginning. And moody, but not raging. Mellowed out over a few months. The facial twitches and personality glitches started to fade away. I was able to interact with my family again and now have a great relationship with them that I cherish. I love my kids and am learning to function as a mother and a provider for the first time on my own in a safe an loving way. This drug truely has saved my life and the well being of my children and their upbringing. Unfortunately it has come with a price. I have gained 76 pounds in 7 months. My thyroid is effected. I have abnormal heart electrical signals. High blood sugar. I stop breathing in my sleep. I have constant swelling on the arms legs and feet. I look like Im 8 months pregnant. I sweat and am constantly hot and dehydrated. I get hives and skin rashes all the time. My face is swollen and puffy. My vision is blurry and I cant hardly taste my food. Seems the side effects are piling up faster and faster lately and Im totally bummed out about it. Im suffering through them because I have tried literally dozens of other medications that havent worked at all and this is the best I have found. For those that havent tried it, you should. Its great. Its peace of mind for those who havent had it. And a chance at normalcy. For now, the side effects wont stop me from continuing to take it. Im seeing a specialist to help. Ill keep you updated on if there is resulution. Its the best I have found in 20 years.

Before getting on this drug, I was very psychotic and nothing was helping.  Then when I started this I could tell a little difference, but after being on it for 5 months I'm experiencing hardly any symptoms and I'm feeling normal.  This has been a great drug for me.  When I first started using it I was very sleepy, but now I only get sleepy the day I get my shot, after that I'm good.

After trying other drugs I found the pills are fantastic in making one feel alert during the day. These are slow release tabs so you may have to take a sleeping pill to get to sleep. Now I've been taking the injections for two years. The first six months it takes a little more effort to stay awake during the day though with me this day sleepy feeling decreased. However I can still take day nap though the main reason for that is simply being bored in that I'd rather take a nap than stay awake. Night sleep is normal and you probably won't need a sleeping pill. On doses the first day seems the same as the last and there are no extreme highs or lows. I take the 117 dose. When considering the alternatives there is no other drug I'd rather be taking. Lucky for me with my insurance I can get three doses for $125."

I've found I can think very clearly on this drug. I recommend taking no sleeping pills on this and maybe only one cup of coffee in the morning. Don't smoke or drink alc unless maybe a little drink once in awhile to help you sleep. Don't eat things that can make you nervous like excessive sugar. I take the 117 dose and consistantly feel good as long as I sleep at least six hours a night.

It lasts for 2 years from one shot and will make you a vegetable. I took one shot of this and it had me wanting to commit suicide all the time. My family thinks it has made me retarded and i am forced to live under the care of elders because of what its effects are every day. I have personnaly been messed up on one shot for 7 months and its as powerful as it ever has been. I recoomend no one recieve this medication and take it oraly if you must...this is more like torture and it should be reserved for pedofiles and rapists.

And the end results of not taken it was bad so for the sake of my children and family I took the shot and scared of needles but wasn't as bad as I thought. However it starting to make me feel tired and I just hope it make me eat cause I had to stop taken the one that made me eat so I get depressed and won't eat.

My son has been on this shot for about 9 months now and it has helped his symptoms considerably; he is more communicative and is resting better on this medication than any other he has tried recently. He is also on lithium as well. He still talks to himself some and paces around the house at times but considering how poorly he was doing on some of the other meds it’s a major improvement. He is able to set down and enjoy watching a little TV or play video games now where he wasn’t before this medicine. Be careful with any of these meds and good luck.

I am the mother of a 20 year old son on Invega Sustenna IM for 6 months.  He has not had any weight gain but he is more sleepy.  The drug has dramaticly lowered the voices but has not eliminated them all together.  The mood swings are reduced significantly but don't forget he is still a young adult.  
I as the care taker love the once a month injection.  I am no longer concerned with him being compliant with his medication.  
As a care taker I highly recommend this medication.  It is expensive but Medicaid does pay for it.  
Good Luck!!"

I've been on the trinza formulation for about a year. I'm happy with symptom control (no longer anger problems from paranoia etc.).  However, I do still have anxiety episodes about twice a week (thoughts of harm to self and others).

Unfortunately, it seems to have worn off after about a month and a half, and he's now supplementing with oral paliperidone and experiencing symptoms. He wants to go back t the Invega Sustenna because the Trinza has just not been as effective.

She started having extreme side effects, muscle tremors, involuntary muscle movement, drooling, difficulty swallowing, weight loss, not being able to open a water bottle or any kind of bottle. I thought she had early signs of dementia no it was invega trenza. So upset it worked for her and the injections we're so convenient if you know anyone schizophrenic it's so hard to get them to take their medicine. I took her off the injection myself. It's not worth it she wasn't even driving anymore she forgot how and didn't have the motor skills to drive a stick or the muscle strength. The Dr now says it could take 4 months for side effects to get out of her system or they can just be permanent now. What kind of life is this for her and I the one that takes care of her. She's on a medicine that is for side effects from Parkinson's disease and that's helping her. Hopefully it's not permanent. There has to be some other way. She's worse off now than when she was having schizo symptoms. Now do we have to deal with all that and hallucinations, paranoia etc. I hope not.

I have actually had a suppressed appetite and lost 10.4 lbs. Medication does not work typically on me like others. I have so much less anxiety and my mood and voices are now under control. My suicidal ideation is pretty much gone. I started at 3 mg, but it wasn't effective until I got up to 9 mg. I have Schizoaffective disorder. This is the only medication that I feel is helping me cope. It was also a last resort because I've been on all of the old ""typical"" antipsychotics and the new ""atypicals."""

Was switched to 9mg and the thoughts and my attitude have drastically been affected positively. I also take zyprexa (low dose), I have not seen any weight gain from Invega. Invega makes me very drowsy initially after taking the pill so I take it at nighttime. Underlying drowsiness throughout the day. I am able to go to college and do all my work well. Do not feel like a zombie like on other anti-psychotics. Has been a good experience for me. Earned a 3.7 GPA last semester in upper-division classes.

I don't even want to get up and cook or eat. I do though, and have gained 50  pounds. This drug has been a nightmare for me and I'm stopping it next month. I just hope I can get my life back afterwards. Depression has been a big issue and I feel dead. I don't see how anyone else can tolerate being on this medication. In the beginning it was not bad, but the side effects just kept on getting worse and worse. Today I'm a shell of my former self. Id rather have hallucinations and delusions than live like a zombie. If I was forced to take this medication then I'd rather be dead. I will quit cold turkey next month and I expect a wild ride. Maybe some day ill experience happiness again. Until then, I'm absolutely devastated and miserable.

So many negative reviews, I’m assuming these people probably haven’t lived with Schizophrenia and are probably misdiagnosed because I’d give my left arm to finally feel like a functional part of society again.  It’s only been a week o The injection and after the initial pain of the injection sites subsided I felt and increase in hunger thirst restlessness and insomnia or lack there of. There is pain at the injection site a few days after the injection but after that pain subsides and get back to feeling normal within about five days Still fighting every day with delusions and regular schizophrenic things that tend to happen with schizophrenia but I am starting to realize that not all of them are actually real I’m starting to finally feel like the cloud is been lifted and I can finally differentiate between what is real and what is imagined.

I don't take this medication but,my teen daughter does.  She just started taking it two days ago and I am slowly seeing results she still paces a bit but, very sleepy at times and seemed very sad/pouty for about 5 minutes and came back to being ok after I reassured her and hugged her.  They are taking her off some of her oral medications as she slowly adjusts to the injections.  The only thing is that she seems to have an extra healthy appetite but, if the voices go away or diminish substantially then it will be worth it.  I just have to keep her active in the meantime.  I don't let her mope around I will invent any reason I can think of to get her out of the house.  My only current concern is that she seems more like swollen than anything not fat but swollen.  I hope they come up with an inverna injection that does not cause any weight gain because that would make a young teen or any person truly happier and more active.  Before all this meds my daughter was 105lbs and now she is about 140lbs. she is 5ft 4in tall.  My daughter just turned 18.  
Question 4 should have the option to differentiate between the patient and caregiver personal stats information.  I hope the government gives more money for more research on mental illness.  It seems that mental illness is the stepchild illness when it comes to overall funding.  This and denial on the part of some families due to fear of stigmatizing their loved one has created an epidemic and its time we let go of that nonsense and talk openly about mental illness.  There is nothing to be ashamed of if you or someone in your family has mental illness of any kind. "
