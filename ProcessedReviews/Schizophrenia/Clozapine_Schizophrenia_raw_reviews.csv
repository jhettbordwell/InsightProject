It is the most destructive brain altering drug known to man!
There is no way of getting off it without major relapse! FACT
It should never be a last resort med!!!
If you want to end some ones life put them on this med!

I've tried pretty much all of the schizophrenia medicines. And this one is the best. It has stopped hallucinations, delusions, everything. The only thing i don't like about it is how much it makes me sleep. I've went from about 8 hrs a night to 12. Its still worth it though."
7$Schizophrenia$9/25/2013 8:02:22 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) $5$5$3$My brother started clozapine over 10 years ago. it changed his life and he got back what the mental disorder  had taken from him. he use to be hospitalized against his will on a regular monthly basis. the police would take him by force. he was violent and paranoid and i felt so sorry and scared of him. I love him but he hated me when he got sick. He and I now live together and his life is so good. he is happy and takes the medication on his own because it works. he has never been hospitalized sinse taking clozapine.

18$Schizophrenia$1/23/2010 12:07:24 PM$Reviewer: [email protected], 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) $2$1$2$I am the younger brother and legal guardian to a 55 year old femal that has been on this treatment (colzapine) for approximately 20 years and we are finding that there are many problems after prolonged use of this medication. The reason that this treatment was sought was because the alternitive tretments were so devistateing to her general health and mental behavior. The alternitive medications were stelzine, thorzine, and heldol. Currently she is recieving 500 mg per day of clozapine along with other medications but as of the last 6 months she has been experianceing total regression of her illness, in other words she now is worse than she's been in the past 15 years. I would like to find a alternitive to clozapine. I would like to try a medication that was designed for a female if at all possible. She has been hospitalized 4 times in the last 6 months and I'm running out of options. Any sugestions would be greatly appretiated.

30$Schizophrenia$1/1/2009 5:37:32 PM$Reviewer: speedylee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) $4$4$3$Tried all other antipsychotics and Clozapine has been superior.  Found that using Clozapine with Haldol (or other antipsychotic) is not a good idea.  Clozapine alone, is best.  Give it at least 6-9 months and don't be afraid to go up on dosage if all testing indicates ok to do so.

14$Suicidal Behavior in Schizoaffective Disorder$8/21/2010 9:49:34 PM$Reviewer: Starwood,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $5$5$3$My son had been tormented with mental illness since in high school. He attempted suicide 2 times heard voices and thought tv and radios were talking to him. He had been in mental hospital 3 times, and it was not until a very excellent psychiatrist started him on clozaril, that it was like a miracle. He is on very low doses and can function now , go to school and work. He is also on low dose lithium at bedtime. Although monthly blood draws can be a nuisance , it is well worth the inconvenience.  he also has an excellent therapist who helps him look forward and not rehash the past.
