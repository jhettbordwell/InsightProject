No more wanting to have sex, because you can't get it up.Grew man boobs.Price of medicine is high even though it has been out for years.Started off at 105 pounds and now 195 in three months.I'm a short guy about 5'5"" and now it harder to walk because of the weight gain."
16$Schizophrenia$11/8/2012 1:17:48 AM$Reviewer: juliemetcalf13, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$i have been takeing this med for over a week it is not helping my side effects are worse
17$Schizophrenia$10/20/2012 12:15:30 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$I switched to Fanapt because I was experiencing TD with Latuda, and it was happening at my job.That immediately stopped when I started, but there have been some drawbacks. I had to get use to the lightheadness and the sedation I deal with is as bad as when I was on Geodon.This is my 5th medication change,so I don't know how many more options I have. There is no weight gain, so I guess I will try and figure out a plan to fight it. Same old battle, just new drug.
18$Schizophrenia$9/8/2012 2:12:40 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$I have been taking Fanapt for a week and half.  The side effects at first were horrible; dizziness, headache, fatigue, dry eyes and mouth, congestion, insomnia, etc.  I was switching from Latuda to the Fanapt and there was a little while when I was first on it that my symptoms came back (hallucinations and delusions mostly).  Now I'm to the point where I could handle the side effects I still have (dry eyes, mouth, congestion) except that my legs keep swelling pretty big.  I'm using Flonase for the congestion, which really helps.  My symptoms are under control but I have a feeling that when I see my psychiatrist they will want me to switch to something else.
20$Schizophrenia$4/14/2012 9:52:26 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$5$I have been on this drug for some time now up to 4mg daily. I am not seeing any benefits with this drug. I still see things and people (I call Gremlins) but mostly at night, so I do not go out at night which limits me from some family and friends outings.

46$Schizophrenia$10/20/2010 11:13:15 PM$Reviewer: parker, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $3$2$5$I have been taking this drug for about 5 weeks now and I can't say that it's made me gain weight or not because I am on a strict diet. The voices have gottin better. I have bad mucsle cramps, I am depressed and I am angry for no reason. Not hearing the voices and seeing things are great but the side effects are terrible.

I can no longer get an erection or produce sperm.If you plan on having kids this medicine won't give you the ability too. I was fine until my doctor put me on this crap.Also rapid weight gain

53$Schizophrenia$7/11/2010 7:03:23 PM$Reviewer: theguy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$It works great for voices and paranoia. The negatives are fast weight gain and I look stoned.I gained 28 pounds in one month on this medicine. I currently take 6mg twice a day. 
54$Schizophrenia$6/30/2010 1:34:05 PM$Reviewer: Ginny, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking this for almost 3 months now and am now taking 10mg twice daily.My parents say I stopped talking nonsense.I do not hear fake voices as much.The side effect of this is mostly dry mouth and sometimes fatigue.I stopped gaining weight since I stopped the other medicine.I am doing so much better and should be able to go back to school in the fall.
56$Schizophrenia$6/2/2010 1:50:42 PM$Reviewer: Marie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This new medicine is helping me cope much better and with less side effects.
60$Schizophrenia$4/25/2010 5:27:55 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  (Patient) $1$1$5$Don't take this drug unless you hvae plenty of muscle relaxers and can sit or lay down all day. This medicine has just turned me into according to my family when they see me, it looks like you are drunk. This medicine has totally messed with my sleep cycle in thatI am awake during the night and day time with very little sleep. If your body is sensitive to EPS (extrapyramidal syndrome) then please do not take this drug, it only makes it worse. And as for the whole bit about about being able to think clearer, don't believe it, it just made me more confused and I also feel very slow with my speech and verbal responses.
