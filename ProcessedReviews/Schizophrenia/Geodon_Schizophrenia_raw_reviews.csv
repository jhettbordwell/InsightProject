I have been taking lithium, lamictal, emsam and xanax without much, if any, relief.  Last week I thought that I would be going into the hospital due to the irrational sense of dread/doom that I was experiencing.  I was terrifed for no reason, could not sit still, I was nearly unable to speak and I had no idea why or what to do about it. I was on the verge of an emotional, mental and physical collapse. Within 30 minutes of taking 40 mg of Geodon I could literally feel the hyper-anxiety/panic draining off me like water in the shower.  Today I am feeling great but like I am on speed that has been dosed with extra speed.  I also have had insomnia for 3 nights and a depressed appetite. But I'm not unbearably tired, I don't feel ""high"", my hands are not shaking any worse than usual and I feel mentally in control for the first time in a very long time. Maybe the other side effect is I can't stop talking.  But anything is better than what I felt last week and for the past years.  I don't know what will happen in the next few days or weeks but right now, this minute, I am happy with me and with my life.  I don't remember the last time I've felt like this. I'd like to sleep tonight but if I don't, that is okay.  The me that was lost is back. I am going to say a prayer tonight that I never lose her again."

12$Schizophrenia$8/24/2014 3:57:12 PM$Reviewer: Anne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$1$2$"I was prescribed this medicine because I hear voices. It has worked very well, despite having a difficult time transitioning onto it. I have heard some voices, but they are minimal. However, we had to put me on such a high dosage that I was falling asleep in class. Even on a lower dosage, I had to take an hour to two-hour nap every day and could not stay awake for more than thirty minutes in the car. Then we switched to taking it all at night (another rough transition) but I was still low on energy, so we lowered it again.
We are thinking of lowering the dosage once more, but it is incredibly scary gambling with mental illness, especially during the semester. I can only pray I will not hear voices again.
This drug has the worst withdrawal out of every anti-psychotic I have taken. If I miss the time I'm supposed to take it by two hours, or even one, I begin to feel terrible. My pupils dilate significantly during withdrawals. If I miss taking it during a meal and take it on an empty stomach, it does not kick in for at least an hour. It keeps me awake when I have not taken it as well.
Even talking about this medicine makes me feel terrible. I can only hope that I will eventually switch onto another medication without an episode."

31$Schizophrenia$1/24/2013 8:58:06 PM$Reviewer: Schizobus, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I suffer schizoaffective disorder. I switched from Abilify to Geodon mostly because I could only tolerate a low dose of Abilify, which wasn't providing enough therapeutic value. I now take 60mg of Geodon in the morning with breakfast and 80mg of Geodon in the evening with dinner for a total of 140mg daily. I have been taking over 100mg of Geodon daily for about two years now. Geodon helps prevent my psychosis and balances out my mood. I suffer bad akathisia in the evening a few times a week for a few hours with this drug. Most of the time I just try to sleep when akathisia strikes and I awake feeling better. I sleep a lot on this drug: I usually sleep 5 to 7 hours a night and then another 2 to 4 hours in a nap. I find it crucial to take my doses with a meal, as the oral bioavailability is allegedly reduced in half when consuming the drug without food. I sometimes feel as though I withdraw from the drug if I take my dose off schedule or if I have been unable to consistently take the drug with a meal. The withdrawal begins to manifest in symptoms of anxiety and nausea. I have never been overweight but my weight has fluctuated quite a bit in a range of 40lbs since I started taking antipsychotic drugs. I find Geodon doesn't make me gain so much weight for an antipsychotic but I currently have a BMI of 22. Geodon is probably my favorite neuroleptic of the five that I have tried so far.

I'm schizoaffective. This medication really helps with the psychotic symptoms of my disorder like the delusions and the hallucinations. It also helps me sleep at night since I take it in the evening. I get blood draws every 6 months to keep an eye on my blood sugar levels. Am taking Geodon with Depakote ER, and Zoloft. Works great together. Actually feel productive and ""normal"" most days."
46$Schizophrenia$2/3/2011 3:15:18 AM$Reviewer: knife, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I had years of ineffective meds. When prescribed geodon at a hospital it solved all of my diagnosis problems. I was raised to a place where negative thoughts didn't exist, I looked for fear and the resulting loss of control of thoughts and feelings and was glad to realize fear didn't come even when I was looking for it. Finally I felt pleasure which is hard to come by. It was my miracle drug until the Grand Mal seizure as a result of an allergy to the drug. I have suffered several years since and now take 6 meds. I wish there was a drug to take with the geodon to avoid the allergic reactions. Alternately I want to try Invegra.

(I never hallucinated that much that intensely before I took it.) Then I started to get dizzy and my face would go numb as it wore off. I also would twitch and tense my leg muscles as I tried to relax. Over 4 months of taking it I became emotionally numb, very quiet, and distant from my family. I also required 9-10 hours of sleep at night. When I tried something else I was dizzy for three days like I was withdrawing from it. I don't know witch was worse the illness or the drug both hurt my house hold. Now I am taking seroquel 200mg to sleep and abilify 5mg in the morning. As of now (1 month)I have no noticeable side effects and I don't feel it ""wearing off"" like the geodon did. "

First off it made me feel really restless and feverish then on the third day I was taking it a had tardive dyskinesia which is a big word meaning I lost all control of my facial muscles as well as my tongue. I though I was going to swallow my tongue. I ended up hhaving to go to the ER to get a shot to counteract the reaction. I stopped taking the geodon immediately.
98$Schizophrenia$9/14/2008 5:11:05 PM$Reviewer: Victor, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$3$"Yes, this medicine has been very effective when nothing else worked, but after 5 years I got excruciating headaches starting early in the year.... NONSTOP~!  After exhausting the ER with a trip a month and my Doctor's comprehensive tests, which showed nothing, we came to the conclusion that Geodon may be the culprit.  Have reduced meds slowly from 180 a day (topped at 200/day for a short period) down to 80, headaches are still there!  No one told me the consequences of getting off this stuff.  On top of the headaches, dry heaves, body aches, muscle jerking, it's been hell so far.  My Doctor (primary physician) has been researching this drug non stop and we hope to find an end to the pain.  My Psych doctor can't understand what I'm talking about, she's not heard of weaning off this drug being so difficult.  I know it's not just me.  

So far tho I'm adjusting to the upper doses of Seroquil to compensate for the Geodon and it's taking care of the mental issues for which I'm grateful.

However, everyone MUST be warned about the incredible difficulty PHYSICALLY getting off this drug.  Had I know it would be this painful and difficult I might have preferred the mental issues to dealing with this severe chronic pain every day.

Good luck and think twice about using this drug. "

I have been taking Geodon 80mg twice daily for years.  It is pretty effective at controlling my psychotic symptoms, anger, fear, etc. The only side effect I have noticed is that is makes me fall asleep. I've tried lower doses but symptoms came back. The sleepiness is intense and unpredictable. I often have to pull over the car if I'm driving because of it. After a short nap I'll be okay. The episodes of passing out made me lose my last job. Overall the side effect (sleep) controls my daily activities. Pretty rotten, but better than being controlled by a Demon.

Go to the best Psychiatrist you can. 80 % of family (general) doctors receive only cursory training  in prescribing psyco-active meds. They haven't learned the subtle and not so subtle behavioral changes that can occur. I took Geodon (2 -80mg /day) for about five years. While I was taking it I could not see the changes. It did not make me sleepy, drunk, or any other obvious bad symptom. I did not laugh or cry for 5 years.  It's hard to explain but nothing just ""occurred"" to me. List of some of the things that didn't occur to me: proper hygiene, to get new shoes when mine had holes, to clean my house, to eat anything other than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, to get legal help to save my house when my step-mom passed and by far the worst: I didn't pet my dog or cats during that time and I am a hopeless animal lover. I have 3 college degrees and post-graduate work. One of these degrees is in Psychology. I worked at a mental health facility for two years. If I could have objectively observed myself I would have been shocked. All my family and friends had moved or passed away so there was no-one to observe the changes. By sheer luck my insurance changed and no longer covered Geodon ($400+ per month) so I stopped taking it. Now I'm alive again! I've lived with hallucinations for over twenty years. I don't have ""scary"" ones I just get overwhelmed sometimes which can lead to a panic attack. I have yet to try a med that has an effect on the hallucinations where it is even remotely worth putting up with the usually severe side-effects. People with extremely severe problems to the point where they are living no kind of life might very carefully try lower doses of Geodon. Good luck and God bless.

p.s.  no weight gain at all!!!"

The Psyciatirc doctor who prescribed it to me was getting kick backs from the pharmacutical company and is no longer working for mental health office. I do not recommend this juke to anyone, I not only had to dial with my psyciatic disorder but I all so had to deal with the horrable side effects. I am doing much better on Lexapro, and Seroquel, life is completely different in a good way.

Doctors only treat patients with drugs. Drug companies send promoters to doctors, doctors sell the medicine/drugs, doctors invest in the drug company through stocks.

If you want effective treatment, seek natural treatment. I guarantee you'll find natural treatments for depression, schizophrenia, you name it.

I guarantee they'll be cheaper than the drugs, doctors visits, and potential problems you could face - because drug companies don't pay for your hospital visits from THEIR drug""s side effects.

If you really want to empower yoourself, and stop being a tool for doctors and pharmacuetical companies - research the orthomlecular treatment for your illness. Oh, and please keep in mind - people who use natural treatments are ""quacks"" according to the FDA and other agencies. But I guarantee taking some St. John's Wort for depression will give you less side effects than the drugs! (Who's the real quack?)

May good bless you and help guide you through any illness this country is trying to profit off from you going through.

For those wondering. Here's the dose of meds I started at - 1,500 mg and 120 mg.

The dose I'm at now - 500 mg and 40 mg.

The dose I'll be at in no time flat - zero and zero mg."

On 6/9/2010, 18 yr old son had been out w/friends all morning. His buddy brought him back to our house having a severe convulsive reaction. They thought maybe to Geodon. That seemed odd to me because he hadn't had any reactions before or had any med since last night--that I knew of. 
He looked like he was having a stroke or an overdose reaction to either RX or possibly illegal drugs. (The only other thing his friend admitted to was a Native American cigarette he had given him, Smoky Joe. An ER nurse searched the ingredients on the internet. He found no real medical concern.)
  The main ER doctor is pretty certain our son’s reaction was to the Geodon, based on the good response to the ""antidote"" they gave him. It was not an allergic reaction but another type. He explained the meds (which he had already been taking for 3 weeks) caused some type of misfiring of the nerves. 
   He had been unable to speak understandably, or control his muscle movements. His hands & neck  muscles were involuntarily contorted, & his heart rate was dangerously high. He was having convulsions, different than a seizure. He was awake, alert & responsive. I guess seizures are an in-&-out reflex of the muscles. Something I hope to never have to learn more about.
They were originally going to give him Cogentin to counteract the Geodon, but it would take too long to get from the pharmacy, so they gave him a shot of Benadryl, which worked in about 30 sec. to calm him & take away all pain. Both the ER doctor & the psychiatrist say Geodon could continue to be taken in conjunction w/another medication (possibly Cogentin?), but our son didn’t want to, nor did his Psychiatrist advise it. He prescribed a higher dose of Zyprexa (15 MG) to try, but our son is too apprehensive about having another reaction, so he chooses to take nothing & deal w/the voices.

My blood glucose levels were off the charts, and if I was even half an hour late taking the dose, I would experience withdrawal symptoms, as though it was a street drug! This past August and September, I refused to take the medication anymore, and I experienced 19 days of severe withdrawals, even after having lowered the dosage over the course of more than a month. I have been down the road of kicking drug habits in the past, and getting off of Geodon was worse than anything I've ever dealt with. And the worst part of all is that I haven't had a single psychotic relapse in the time it's been since I stopped taking the drug, but my former shrink had refused to even lower the dosage, even after I showed her what it was doing to my blood glucose. If I could, I would ban this drug from the entire planet. The ""benefits"" not worth going through the withdrawals and the worsening of Diabetes."

682$Schizophrenia$7/9/2008 11:01:26 PM$Reviewer: trebe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$When I was started on geodon the side effects scared me.  The only problem i had in the beginning was sleepiness which went away in 2 weeks.  This drug changed me from a zoombie to a fully functioning human being.  I was even able to eventually wean off my trileptal and zoloft, which made me feel even better.  This drug has changed my life for the better, I think with true clarity and can't imagine going back to those zoombie drugs like seroquel ever again.  It makes me so well that non-compliance will never be an issue.  In fact the opposite occurs, when low on pill count i replace as early as possible.  I take 160 mg a day and the hallucinations fade to the background, and i can live a good life now.

I've since taken every class of drug, at least 40 drugs including MAOIs, tricyclics, SSRIs, aphetamines like adderall and ritalin, even hydrocodone had some limited effect, but all to no avail. After reporting some psychotic symptoms to my doctor recently, I was given Geodon in addition to Lamictal (somewhat helpful) I already was taking. Rather than being sedated, I have more energy now and the voice is quieter and I'm less paranoid, all good things. I have some hope now that I can be treated effectively after 16 years of frustration and hell.
