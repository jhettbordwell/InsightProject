I have been on cymbalta for nearly 4 years now and it has made my life so much easier. My kids don't have to wonder why mom is sad or panicking anynore.

Felt nauseated with a fowl taste in my mouth. Could not sleep and had a headache. Upon reading more about the drug taking ibuprofen with it is not advisable. Also if you suffer from migraines it states that sumatriptan should not be taken with it either. I wish I would have read the reviews before taking this drug. After reading more about it I would I feel that my doctor should have not prescribed this to me. I only took one pill.
24$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/29/2018 2:32:31 PM$Reviewer: Cecilia S, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I am 5 weeks into taking this medication and noticed a significant difference within the first 2 days. I slipped and fell 9 months ago and  been dealing with a herniated disc, multiple annular tears, and a pats defect fracture everyday since. IÃ¢Â?Â?ve never been depressed in my life until about 6 months ago when I realized how long the recovery would be and how much ithe one fall turned my entire life upside down. I was crying daily (sometimes multiple times) and started havingsevere and uncontrollable anxiety everyday. I was also in chronic pain all through my spine and right side of my body. This medication Is literally saving me right now. My mood has improved and I have only had a few breakdowns (crying episodes), which have all been triggered by me seeing my now ex partner (he ended things with me a few months ago after many years). So - this medicine is great! Only side effects seem to be loss of appetite and also more prone to bruising (I have always been - but now is worse). No loss of sexual drive, no drowsiness, and no loss of focus or energy. My mind feels more clear than it has in a long time.

Works great.  Takes about 3 weeks before the benefits are fully realized but you can feel the difference within the first day.  Slight nausea and sweating sometimes, and it reduces the satisfaction/intensity of orgasms but has not reduced my libido since once you are generally feeling better, your libido should increase anyway.

She prescribed Duloxetine which I have taken for at least 8 years.  It has been the most effective medication to date. With the help of a clinical psychologist there are only 2 months per year that I consider low periods.  I will revisit my therapist before those months. I have been in and out of psychological therapy and psychiatric care for 20 years.  I would like to tell others to not give up or be satisfied with minimal quality of life. I worked with 3 other psychologists before I worked with my current one.  Only one of those psychologists was not a good match. The other two had to give up practicing for health reasons.  We moved to another city, but I am close enough to see the therapist I have worked with for about 10 years. I only see her when I need a fine tuning. I am currently looking for a new psychiatrist in the city where we live because my previous doctor retired.

53$Anxiousness associated with Depression$11/28/2015 10:58:43 PM$Reviewer: katep99, 13-18 Female  (Patient) $2$1$5$I switched from a different medication to duloxetine about six months ago. I had a terrible transition process and ended up in the emergency room due to the severe side effects. I have gone from 30 mg to 60 mg and tried light therapy, but I have never found real effectiveness from duloxetine. The negative effects outweigh any benefit.

Pdoc prescribed this for depression symptoms and pain relief. Been on it for 5 years. Once I ran out for one day and experienced the ""brain buzz"". I wanted to get off of it but Pdoc said no. When I finally do get off of this med, I know it will be a very slow process.  I wish she would have told me how intense the withdrawal symptoms can be- I would have asked for a different med. Now I feel helpless to this med. "

I also have chronic pain.  My pain doctor suggested doubling the dose for pain treatment, but I refused.  I currently take 60 mg. and he said the starting does for pain is 120mg.  I experience night sweats, ""foggy head"", low energy from the drug.  I once tried to decrease from 60mg to 40mg.  It was the worse 2 weeks of my life.  DO NOT START TAKING THIS DRUG. If you do, chances are you will never get off from it. I recently talked with a nurse who had to temporarily commit her husband when he tried to decrease his dose.    Surely everyone does not have the same experience, but a quick web search will show you that many people do.  "
144$Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/22/2019 3:44:09 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I've been on Cymbalta (generic) for approx a year now, yes I need to go back to my physician.  Initially it worked, but I believe it is because I didn't have the inordinate amount of stress I currently have.  I have had anxiety attacks, horrible panic attacks and a general overall depression.  60mg per day does diddly squat.  I attempted to wean myself off, big no no.  I had suicidal thoughts, horrific dreams and wanted to punch a kitten.  So back on them I went.  My physician put me on them because they worked well for her.  I think physicians really need to tailor psychotropic meds according to the person.  Don't immediately prescribe the new and latest or what they or their family are taking.  So, now that I lost my job and have no insurance I need to wait to see a doctor to get off these horrible meds.  Did I mention the dry mouth is horrendous?  I'm sure this works for some but is not for all.
149$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/11/2019 8:16:57 PM$Reviewer: Scotlandfog , 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$IÃ¢Â?Â?ve been prescribed Cymbalta since 2002 for Fibromyalgia but I found that it also helps greatly with my depression. That is until the generic brand came out and my insurance forced me to switch to it. I didnÃ¢Â?Â?t know what was wrong with me at first, I was irritable and then down right angry! After two weeks on it, I was constantly thinking of ways to kill my spouse! Then all of a sudden on day as I was semi rational I tried to figure out what changed. My spouse hadnÃ¢Â?Â?t! Then I realized it was the generic I was taking! I immediately called my doctor and told him how I was feeling and he of course said stop the generic and heÃ¢Â?Â?d prescribe the name brand Cymbalta again and write a letter to my insurance as why I needed to be on the name brand! After two weeks of taking Cymbalta again I felt like myself again! I take 60mg one time daily now. I used to be on 60mg twice a day but it destroyed my libido! So it was lowered. My Fibromyalgia makes me hurt of course but the Cymbalta helps a great deal. And although I have some down days theyÃ¢Â?Â?re more situational than chronic depression. I donÃ¢Â?Â?t ever plan on stopping Cymbalta because it has helped me so greatly! As long as itÃ¢Â?Â?s the name brand.

Diagnosed with Type 2 Bipolar/GAD 20 years ago more more recently, Fibromyalgia and panic disorder. Cymbalta, for me, is the type of medicine that you don't notice actually working until you have to stop taking it.  There have been a few hiccups with refills that has left me to going without for a week or two (I know you shouldn't quit cold turkey - I would try to space out what little I had left to avoid issues.) It didn't even click in my head why the muscle/joint pain returned, why I was back to crying, why I panicked every time I walked in a crowded store until I received my refill and was able to ease back on and everything was back to being at least manageable.  I totally understand that this medication doesn't work for everyone and people experience different reactions but for me, the benefits completely outweigh the temporary (but mild) side effects. I had to give this plenty of time to work but it really does make life a bit easier.
162$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/7/2019 3:47:57 PM$Reviewer: Linda, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I was prescribed this after an attempt on my life. I've been taking 90 dose daily. It gives me horrible sweats, vivid dreams, constant yawning & lock jaw, it wears off in the evening and makes me extremely irritable and aggressive and finally it also did not prevent my manic/anxiety episodes from happening. Although I wasn't as depressed on it, it didn't help with my anxiety or manic behavior. 
166$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/14/2018 2:50:47 PM$Reviewer: DaisyD, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Taken for dysthymia, a mild form of chronic depression.

Will talk to my PCP about another antidepressant at my next appt Jan 2.

Incredible improvement in anxiety and depression, very seldom have either now.  30 was good but 60 is better.  Take 30 at 8 am and noon to avoid sleeping issues.  Side effects at first (dry mouth, insomnia, decreased libido) but all decreased or went away entirely after a few weeks.  Advise to eat healthy diet and limit caffeine and alcohol, your side effects will be minimum.  Sorry that this drug doesn't help everyone, for me it's been dramatic change for the better.

Ruined my life and my studies. Have passed out countless times, one of the last lost me my education because I didn't know why I had a syncople episode. So thanks so much after all the money I spent thinking it was helping me, but honestly saw no changes. Should have stopped taking it, but NO! You can't just stop taking it! I have every adverse reactions to this med listed. Am I the stupid one or are the creators of this ""great medication"" or just a bunch of assholes that got it on the market and used people. You can go to hell. You knew the major symptoms and yet I suffered way too long on it. Hope your mansions are beautiful, we can barely pay our mortgage. Thanks for absolutely nothing. "

I feel better than I have ever felt. Taking it with Wellbutrin and trazadone. I hope I never get some of the bad side effects, but if I do I will still be thankful for the life it has given me now. So sorry to hear that it doesn't work for everyone.

It wasnâ??t making any difference and then I experienced the formerly unknown horror of brain zaps. At times I felt like I was floating just off the mattress! Iâ??ve always been physically healthy so this was far worse and scarier than any mental â??challengeâ? I was having. Then I tried to quit. Nightmare thatâ??s a blur now of several days, little sleep, and feelings I can only describe as messed up. Thankfully, I found someoneâ??s review online that described how to ween off of it successfully. Each dose, you remove 3 more beads than previously removed from the capsule. It worked and Iâ??ll never view Rx drugs the same. Unless youâ??re facing the alternative of a life of hell without any other hope, stay away from Cymbalta, is my strong advice. If you take it, understand that it will own you and new problems you never imagined when become your norm. Can you tell I feel lucky to have found a way off? By the way, turned out I had developed Complex PTSD from my experiences and was ultimately helped only by EMDR after 7 years of seeking help from expensive psychiatrists and psychologists with no noticeable change. Highly recommend it though totally surprised it actually worked. I have a functional life now, off of Social Security Disability finally, and working full time for a year now with bonuses from my performance after being unable to hold a job for the first time in my life over 9 years.prior to now. Really want to be able to help others who are where I was.

He died alone at home at age 23, after the specialist ignorantly increased his dosage.  Since he was heat sensitive after suffering heat stroke 18month earlier, as divulges to the ""doctor"", he should NEVER have been using CYMBALTA/DULOXETINE.  "
211$Anxiousness associated with Depression$11/3/2017 1:59:18 PM$Reviewer: Cymbalta issue, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$I began Cymbalta and approx. 4 weeks in I began having diarrhea.  I thought it was a virus and waited 10 days and then went to my doctor.  I discussed with her the only change that I had was the Cymbalta.  She didn't think that it was the cause and so I remained on the drug.  2 weeks later I still had the diarrhea so I was referred to a gastroenterologist.  They did a colonoscopy and said it initially looked healthy.  A week or so later they called me and told me that I had Lymphocytic Colitis.  One of the first things she said to me was that she noticed I was on Cymbalta.  I told her say nothing more because I was already in the middle of weaning myself off because I felt like it had to be the issue.  She said yes they have found that it can cause this. So you think ok problem solved, but Lymphocytic Colitis cannot be cured.  I am now under control but only because I take Budesonide 3mg daily.  It was a miserable existence without it, and don't say why don't you try gluten free, or no dairy... I have tried it all.  My 2nd opinion Gastroenterologist said, our patients with this have also tried everything, just take the pill. Why in an otherwise healthy person, exercise regularly eat healthy would it do this... I don't know but I am obviously not the only one!

It did help somewhat with my depression, but not as well 4 anxiety. Was also told it helps with fybromyalgia, but not much for me. Still had to b on Valium and an antihistamine for my anxiety. I began having terrible side affects of sweating uncontrollably, flashes of light and trails of lights, elevated heartbeat, turning bright red, nightmares and complete exhaustion. In bed for days at a time. I thought I was feeling well enough  to come off the medicine, with my doctor's ok,that was in April 2016. Thought i was going crazy when I started skipping days to cut back on it. Finally figured out I had to open the capsules and count the small little pellets until I was down to only about 10 pellets, then stopped completely end of May 2017. In this last month if no Cymbalta I still have the withdrawal symptoms 4-5 days a week. PLEASE be careful coming off if this medication as it causes many to have worse suicidal tendencies. Suicide has happened many times from this medication. Not all doctors know about these problems, BE CAREFUL!!!

If I tried to stay awake I would twitch drop things like a cup of coffee or cigarette would go flying.  I was completely dysfunctional the doctor drops my morphine level and increases Cymbalta it does nothing for my pain but once I stopped I got normal REM sleep again and feel much better.

This medication had me literally climbing the walls! Its primary effect is to increase Norepenephrine (Noradrenaline) and Serotonin by inhibiting reuptake.

Easily the most horrendous and frightening experience ever and FAR worse than no treatment at all.  This is the stuff of nightmares and I would not wish it on my worst enemy.  If you use it, use the LOWEST possible dose, for the least length of time, and be prepared for debilitating detox-ing that makes opiate detox seem like a pleasure.  This should be the last ditch choice after all else has failed and even then you may be better off not taking it at all.

I was on this medication for two months and loved how it was helping me but I had to stop taking it because it made me toss and turn all night long. Even though I couldn't sleep at night I had no problem accidently falling asleep on the couch everyday. 
284$Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/23/2016 8:33:20 PM$Reviewer: MissV, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Had highest hopes that I would be one of the lucky ones for whom this drug worked. Within the 1st 24 hours I had a HORRIBLE headache, my stomach hurt, and I couldn't eat. By the 3rd dose I was also having hideous night sweats and was dizzy to nearly passing out. Was so sleepy and felt so crappy each of the 3 days that I took a dose I had to stay in bed or the day. My dose was only 20mg! Tonight is day 4, but I've decided to stop. I pray I don't suffer withdrawal. 3 days shouldn't be enough to cause withdrawal on stopping, but then, 20mg shouldn't have turned my world upside down either. A year ago I went thru w/d from Pristiq when my ins wouldn't pay for my prescribed dosage. It took me almost 9 months and was the worst hell I've ever been through. I swore I'd never put myself thru that again, yet here I am desperate for a magic pill to make my life livable to the point where my last 3 days have been spent asleep and miserable from trying this drug. I should also mention I took generic, as that's what the Blue Cross bosses think is best and won't pay for name brand.

323$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/3/2015 9:08:12 PM$Reviewer: Sheldonoff, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I am not a doctor.  I am a sick old man. I have been taking Cymbalta 30 mg for several years as a component of my daily medication cocktail. It is virtually impossible to determine or rate the effectiveness of a drug like this when you are taking eight to ten (or more) other medications which deal with contiguous medical conditions.  The side effects of every drug cross the side effects of another drug being prescribed to a patient by a different doctor for a different medical condition.  Sounds confusing and it is.  However, with respect to Cymbalta, I will say this.  When I first began taking the drug, I noticed a definite improvement in my pertinent symptoms.  I have been taking it for several years now at a low dosage and I have continued to notice its effectiveness with no negative side effects.  In short, it has continued to work for me, and in this sense I endorse it.  However, I consider myself lucky because medications such as Cymbalta are prescribed by many doctors who are not sufficiently checking the side effects of parenthetic drugs which his or her patients take. This is particularly the case when some of those medications in a patient's chart have been prescribed by other doctors for other medical conditions.  I suspect that even routine  pharmacology  can be a very dangerous crap game when it is played by too many doctors who have forgotten some of the basic clinical skills they learned in med school.    
335$Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/4/2015 5:58:13 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$1$4$I was prescribed Cymbalta about 2.5years due to some depression and anxiety associated with some major life changes. I started taking it and over time I became very numb to everything. Feelings, emotions, physical feelings and moods. I was not affected by anything and didn't experience happiness, sadness or any sort of emotion despite events that would occur that should cause these emotions, naturally, in any human. I decided this wasn't how I wanted to live, so I tried to come off the Cymbalta on my own. It was the worst experience I have ever had. The withdrawal symptoms are that of a street drug addict and can cause suicidal thoughts, brain zaps, body aches, sweating and severe vomiting. Finally, I was able to locate a doctor that specialized in medicine management. I had to get on Prozac to offset the severe withdrawal symptoms of the Cymbalta and had to ween off of it by reducing the mg. The damage this drug has caused to my health, my mental stability and the after effects of being off it have been life altering. I would never suggest this drug to anyone and would highly warn that should you, or someone you know, start on this medication, that you are under careful and cautious doctor care. This medication ruined my life and after being off of it for about 4 months now, I am still dealing with the consequences.

I also have bad dizzy symptoms. I did some online research and found that Cymbalta causes dizziness like verdugo in alot of patients as well as memory loss. I just cant take the memory loss as it has started affecting me at my job. I have started lowering my doses from 90mg - 60mg to currently 30mg.

After 11years on paxil, and having read the possible benefit of pain reduction, I asked doctor about changing.  I stepped down from Paxil, while starting duloxetine on small dose then increasing as Paxil was phased out.  It's like night and day!  My depression is no longer controlling my life!  I don't think there is any difference in pain control, but I hate to think how bad it would be without it.  I believe my body had become immune to or adjusted to the Paxil so much that it was no longer effective. Other than some sweating at night, I have no side effects.  I am a content person now and no longer dread social situations.
13$Major Depressive Disorder$12/15/2018 8:29:01 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$"This is honestly the worst drug anyone could ever take. I took 60mg of Duloxetine for over 5 years and had to come off it for surgery. 
I was initially prescribed it by a psychiatrist and left on it for so long because my GPs didn’t know what it was or what it did. Admittedly, it did the job and helped a lot with my depression and anxiety, but it wasn’t worth it for the withdrawal symptoms I suffered with. 
Do not take this drug long term - you will never be able to come off it. The withdrawal is absolutely horrendous. I actually thought I was having a seizure at one point. I had absolutely no choice but to come off it because it isn’t available in liquid form. If I wasn’t having surgery, I’d have taken it again in an instant to stop the awful withdrawal effects.  
I have been reading lots about this drug and feel I have to warn people. There have been many lawsuits against the manufacturer because coming off it is likened to coming off speed. The withdrawal can last years for some people. 
I can’t even describe how awful it is trying to come off this drug. I honestly thought I was going to die. I had flashes of electricity through my brain every couple of minutes that rendered me totally unable to do anything. My head was fuzzy, I had awful dreams and sweats, I had stomach upsets and just a terrible feeling of paranoia. 
I have been off it for six months now and I was lucky that the withdrawal effects stopped after around 2 months.
Please, please, please be aware before taking this drug - stopping it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life. I wish I’d known about it before I started taking it. "

132$Major Depressive Disorder$6/10/2008 9:18:13 AM$Reviewer: Jenni, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month$1$1$1$"After approx. 1 wk on Cymbalta, major episode of rt. hand swelling twice the size, fingers w/ no feeling, brown/red/blue ""leather-looking"" skin with a large, pulsating lump that appeared in the center of the hand, stretching the skin as it grew before my eyes within 10 minutes! A very dangerous drug with 35+ side effects that people don't know about unless they search to find real-life experiences & studies done not only in the U.S., but other countries. This lasted 2-1/2 wks; there are reported experiences of swelling of the THROAT in which you must get medical attention immediately--I was ""lucky"" & immediately stopped using. People should always research (on sites other than the drug's site) all possible side effects & consider asking for something far less invasive. My hand literally looked like a monkey's paw & was Not Usable for weeks. I still do not see this particular reporting in the advertisement literature--just ""swelling."" That is an understatement. Be your own best advocate so you will lower the incidence of some of these frightening results. Many of the anti-depressant drugs/anxiety stay in your system even after you stop. Take time to read what other people have experienced & less on ""a few people experienced..."" in ads. I had no prior history of anything of this nature, so it can happen to anyone. There are many excellent drugs (older drugs) that work much better under supervision. Thank you."

It did what it was supposed to do in controlling depression. I changed medications because I found out it wasn't working well with my body chemistry because of Genesight testing. If you have relied on cymbalta as much as I have, tapering off this medication was extremely difficult. Definitely experienced some withdraws and major headaches for about 1-2 months. I would recommend tapering down for a few months with this medication. At the end, don't just stop; but taper down to half pills, every other day for at least a few weeks. 
155$Major Depressive Disorder$4/22/2019 2:33:44 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I was started on this for major depression and was advised it would help my fibro. pain. After taking for 2 plus years, there were 3 occasions where I'd forgotten to take it at my scheduled time, 6 P.M. During the early morning around 3:00 I'd wake up with severe dizziness, headache, nausea, vivid dreams and general feeling of ill health. The first time I didn't realize what was causing it until I found my forgotten pill in my container and feeling somewhat better after a couple hours of taking. The next couple times, it happened again by accident and with the same symptoms. I asked my psychiatrist and ruematologist about getting me off it. Both of them suggested I not because the depression and pain could return. I told them both how severe the withdrawal was and how rapidly it would start in. I take a daily opioid for pain and I explained the withdrawals as very similar. They told me to begin by reducing my dose by counting the little beads inside the capsule. It was then, I googled this awful medication and found the lawsuits against the company. Today, I'm still on it and can't get off and I'm very angry about it. I would swear cymbalta is a opioid and very aggressive one. I will find out

They only make 90,60, and 30 mg Capsules no lower dose or tablets. This Med has destroyed my body and it kills your brain. I am in a lawsuit against them and this drug is pure poison!

Thirteen days after stopping Cymbalta my blood pressure spiked so high I couldn't walk and ended up in ER. My blood pressure is still spiked and can't get it to go down even with blood pressure meds.  I'm spending a lot of money on tests and missed a lot of work due to dizziness, fatigue and inability to drive.

My neck and shoulders has hurt so bad since I came off of it and I am back to having hot flashes alot. I knew the hot flashes had about quit when I was on the cymbalta but did not realize that it was helping to curb them. Now that I have been off of it for awhile they are back and viscous!

Slowly it became less effective. Increasing the dose made my anxiety worse. 

In between doses the withdrawal would start to begin: brain shocks, swishing head, dissociation, panic, brain crunch, confusion, muscle pain, and body buzzing. If I missed a dose, I literally would think I was in some hellish nightmare. 

I began to feel as if Cymbalta was poisoning me.

By the lucky chance (experience of a friend), I found I could switch to Celexa. In combination with fish oil, the Cymbalta withdrawal has been minor. My mood and clarity of mind have been getting better daily. My anxiety is also going down.  "

239$Major Depressive Disorder$12/30/2016 1:22:36 PM$Reviewer: In Recovery, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$3$"I am a 33 year old female recently prescribed 20mg of Cymbalta for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD. This medication has rapidly stabilized my condition and greatly contributed to better mood regulation. In less than a week, Cymbalta alleviated suicidal thoughts and my level of distress in response to triggers. Intrusive memories and fearfulness have been very minimal. Daily crying episodes are significantly reduced. Additional benefits are that my psychosomatic pains and stomach problems are completely gone. Short term side effects included nausea, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. Ongoing side effects are mild dizziness, afternoon drowsiness, and less appetite. Dizziness is manageable if I drink water throughout the day. No sexual side effects experienced while on this drug.

I was also prescribed Cymbalta a decade ago during a major depressive episode requiring inpatient hospitalization. The results were remarkable. In a span of 24 hours, I had much greater mood regulation and was not ruminating on negative thoughts. Cymbalta was also helpful in developing healthy eating patterns after a period of binge eating. The appetite suppressing effect made it easier for me to modify portions and lose the weight I'd gained. I took Cymbalta for two years with minimal side effects. Tapering off the medication went well except for some nausea that eventually resided after a few days. Do not miss a dose or discontinue this medication without a tapering regimen from a doctor. Sudden discontinuation can cause anxiety, nausea, and fatigue. "

I have been on Prozac, wellbutrin, and kolonapin with limited results. Due to major back issues, leg ulcers and the fact that no one can or willing to help with the back and the doctor has no reason on why my leg wounds wont heal I was contemplating suicide. I gained a ton of weight which didn't help and that made the depression worse. I finally talked again to my doctor after I almost committed suicide. He put me on Duloxetine 30mg to start and within a week I could tell a difference. The only side effect so far is sleepiness so I take it in the late afternoon and I can finally sleep. I have been bumped up to 60mg and I feel great. I have had a bunch of people come up and comment that I seem happy and smiling. It has also helped with my back pain and I've been able to cut the amount of muscle relaxers and oxycodone in half.

I suffered severe side-effects with duloxetine I did not have with Cymbalta:  increased agitation, total sexual dysfunction, daily headaches, nightly dreams-vivid and strange, severe dry mouth.  I was given an increased dosage of duloxetine, 90mg, and this did nothing to resolve negative issues.  I also became homicidal.  I was prepared to die in a mass attack - really!  Thank God I was finally able to get my insurance company to start paying for Cymbalta again but only after writing a detailed letter outlining my experiences with Cymbalta vs duloxetine and getting my doctor to concur.  I had started buying my own Cymbalta. $7 per capsule at Walmart then $83 for a 28 day supply via a four hour drive to Mexico.  I was willing to buy my own in the end and if my insurance should ever quit paying I'll buy my own.  The pain and suffering I got from duloxetine is not worth it.

There are so many medications that have side effects, and they differ from person to person, when coming off any medication and even just taking a medication. This best thing you can do is let your DOCTOR take you off and give them feed back as you are going through the process. I can not tell anyone to not use drugs that has been terrible for me, knowing and understanding they cause different effects in each person. Please don't scare someone from what might be exactly what could be the best option for them. Instead constructively talk about and make aware your issues and also explain the dose you are on, other medications and if you are in regular contact with the prescribing Doctor!

Only reason I stopped taking it (about two years ago) was because of the cost but now it comes in generic. When I took it the first time I had a GREAT experience with it. Nothing works better for me than Cymbalta so when I heard it came out in generic form I was so happy and couldn't wait to get back on it. I have been dealing with depression/anxiety for years and I also suffer from migraines. Cymbalta helps with pain also. I cannot emphasize enough that what works for me or others, will work for you. The only way you'll know is if you try. Don't be scared by all the negativity you read by others. Also, when I was on Cymbalta the first time, I was never hungry and I LOST weight... others have said they gained weight which I thought was strange because even my doctor told me one of the side effects was decreased appetite. Whatever you decide to do, I wish you peace, luck and happiness.

I also feel more aggressive and feel like being mean to people. called my Dr. to see what I should do.  I actually feel more depressed than before.

About 5 years ago I started getting increased Depressive episodes which I discussed with my doctor and went back to Zoloft, which did not work as well as it had in the past.  My doctor then switched me to Cymbalta with the dose going to my present 60 mg/day.  I'm better able to focus and am holding down a job again (the depression took away my ability to focus and I lost my job as a result), but I'm still not quite where I know that I can be.  I'm not suicidal, but still on edge a lot, so I will be looking to add something.  No side effects that I've noticed and Cymbalta keeps the worst of the depression under control.

I have been on a lot of anti depression meds (prozac, effexor, and prozac), and this one worked best.  My only side effect is my blood pressure is way to low, and this only started in the last 3 months.  I have to be taken of slowly which is hard cause the withdrawal symptoms  are not fun.  I will be starting a new medication soon.

However, the withdrawal side effects are horrendous!  Patient should be warned in advance of beginning treatment and allowed to weigh their options.  I weaned off over the period of one year.  After one week off the medication, I am still very sick physically.  Headache, nausea, dizziness and confusion.  I would not recommend starting this drug unless you have no other options.

I have currently been weaning myself off of it for over a month and have been completely off of it for 4 days. The debilitating headache I suffer from each day is joined by constant nausea, terrible sleep,agitation, inability to focus,inability to stand still for even short periods of time, and today I went to the doctor and discover that my blood pressure is almost 30 points higher than 6 weeks ago. I am now on a beta blocker in hopes to return it to normal. Do your research before taking this drug, it has something called Cymbalta withdrawal disorder linked to it. Too bad I didn't know this before I started taking it.

356$Major Depressive Disorder$1/25/2015 2:22:36 PM$Reviewer:  Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$5$The only side effect I have with Cymbalta is urinary retention. The biggest side effect is trying to come off of it. It doesn't work so much for easing psychological pain as it does for easing physical pain, which is counterintuitive to its mandate. I highly suggest using a SSRI in conjunction with Cymbalta as it only works fairly well for depression and anxiety.

I had a closed head injury and several medicines to wake me up and sleep and function for years I was a guinea pig and almost gave up from the pain of it all. When my doctor prescribed cymbalta a high dose I cried and cried finally I am on 60 mg per day and I am functioning and have a boyfriend and want to enjoy the time I have with my mom who is 83 years old, I have missed out on so much family time because of depression and trying to climb out of a black hole is hard, because I was alone and had no barometer to tell me if crying 24 hours a day or the opposite of pure rage was healthy or not, I couldn't figure it out myself until I went back to doctor and he would tell me this is not healthy so lets try something else. I have been on 60 mg for over 3 years now and I think more positive and hope anyone who is in a state of depression to keep trying to find the right combination to help you get out of the black hole. The sun is beautiful and I can finally see it, I now have no curtains on my windows and love it.

Physical impact included high blood pressure, heavy weight gain leading to high cholesterol, and the inability to empty my bladder leading to chronic UIT's. I did a gradual taper under my psychiatrist's guidance and went through a devastating withdrawal from which i still have not recovered over 5 months later. developed serious symptoms I never had previous to taking cymbalta including disabling anxiety.   do not let anyone tell you it is the depression coming back. this happens to people who took it for pain and had no history of depression. the black box warning mentions risk of suicidal thoughts. it happens when increasing and decreasing your dose. do not let a doctor tell you that you need anti-depressants for life. get good cognitive behavioral therapy. research shows it works better than drugs and i am living proof. now that i quit, i am active, lost weight, now my bmi is 20. no more High BP and cholesterol is 95.

Nothing was working, and believe me, the doctor's have tried everything!  I am on 60mg now but the doc is about to raise it he said.  Like some of the others said, the brand name worked better, generic seems a little weaker, but after about 3 weeks on this I began feeling motivated again.  Something I had not felt in years.  There is hope out there!  Don't give up!  True it may not be this medicine, but keep trying!!!

I am pretty much on my own with this  because I go to a County Mental Health Facility meaning any follow up is not on the menu....I have been on so many different meds. Over the years including ECT.  God help me, I pray this one will be effective in a good way... I know you have to commit to it and allow a few weeks before throwing in the the towel. I hate that, but what can you do?

I have now been on the generic version, ""Duloxetine,"" for four months.  I have always experienced weight gain and extreme tiredness and loss of motivation while on Cymbalta, and Duloxetine is no different, maybe even worse.  I, too, experience the profuse sweating as others, particularly of my head.  Whereas Cymbalta initially helped my depression, it appears to be slowly lessening in effectiveness.  I know better than to quit cold turkey, so I cut back to 60 mg. a week ago; I cannot tell any difference.  I'll keep it up for a couple of weeks and then cut to 30 mg. to see what happens.  It's the steady weight gain, constant exhaustion, and lack of emotional highs and lows that are doing me in -- not ever joyful and not ever deeply moved, which is all part of the human condition.  I miss ""feeling.""  When one gets ""used to"" sadness, it's time to find another medication."

The first week or two (straight on to 60mg) was very difficult with the nausea, lethargy, headaches and inability to concentrate. I stuck with it (assisted by a supportive family) and after 4-6 weeks felt pretty good all round and I have been in a really good way for 2 years now and never looked back. As part of a planned treatment program in a supportive environment with regular monitoring I can recommend it.

My former psychiatrist put me on cymbalta even though I told her that before I stopped taking meds, wellbutrin was working. I tried to get off of it, and it was hell. I think it contributed to my minor suicide attempt. When I was trying to wean myself off of it I was shaky sensitive to light, vomiting, getting major headaches and over all feeling incredibly awful. I dipped back deep down into my depression, and the only thing that got me out of it was to stop weaning myself off of it and getting back on wellbutrin. I cant function without cymbalta. Do not take this drug, look for another one or yu can become addicted, and it is not pleasant

At first it helped my depression, anxiety, and fibromyalgia a lot. After about a year of being on it, it would stop working and I would have to wean myself off of it using another medication. The side effects were: memory loss, weight gain(60lbs), no sex drive or able to achieve orgasm, angry ALL the time, isolated myself, very tired (sleeping 15hrs per day), extreme dry mouth, and many other horrible side effects. Getting off Cymbalta was the worst EVER! I was sick for over 3 months feeling like I was dying. It is not worth it!!

Bupropion added & felt great for probably 6 months then slowly started having symptoms.  Brain fog, inability to to think & concentrate at work.  As hard as I tried I could not.  It was so bad it completely zapped my energy & I was so fatigued. I went to doctors trying to figure out what was wrong with me & nobody could find anything.  It was to the point of being really scary.  Sometimes I wondered if I should even be driving.  I'd have to ask people at work how to do simple things that I had been doing for 20 years, I couldn't remember their names.  Scary, I would think about killing myself even though I didn't want to die.  God answered my prayers & got me with a psychiatrist who changed me over to generic Effexor XR over a week period (no withdrawal symptoms).  I think Cymbalta should be taken OFF the market, horrible medication!!!  I will give it a 0 rating.  When I contacted the company about the extremely expensive copay earlier on when I took it they told me it was fair.  $300.00 copay?  Fair to who?  Not the consumer that is for sure.

It was a very fast remedy for me.  I soon stopped worrying about what the guy at the grocery store thought or whether news stories on the radio were about me.  Cymbalta interuppted my sleep horribly for about two weeks, then everything improved. I was both more energetic and more sluggish at the same time, mental energy was up, physical energy down, my weight went up. Cymbala also cured my chronic pain from lower back injury as a side effect!
I think it lowers my sex drive a bit. I went off cymbalta because I felt so good and MAN was that a mistake. I was worse than ever before off it, paranoid beyond anxiety and depressed to the point I couldnt function. I went back on and it was horrible for almost a month, no sleep, but it was slowly getting better in 3rd and 4th week and bang, I was back to normal, or at least how I used to be.

It has worked extremely for me, though it is one of other psychiatric drugs I take. Unless you get intolerable side effects, this drug requires adjustment time, like most psych drugs. You might not not if any changes, but the classic way to see if the drug helps you is: Instead of a friend coming up to you asking, ""How are you?"" in a quasi-I'm trying to sound happy but your look is scaring me voice, that same person says to you, ""You're looking fabulous!"", and you can see they mean it. Though that doesn't always happen, you'd be surprised on how often it does. Another way is think about your day. Did you feel better after, or even during, a bad situation? Or even the fact you COULD deal with issue in total? Those are two times that I finally noticing I'm better, because I live with myself and can't see any changes.

I finally realized that over the past year my depression and anxiety have gotten worse. I just kind of go through life in a haze, with some good days but mostly bad days. I've been on Cymbalta for so long that I can't really pinpoint any symptoms specifically from the medicine. I have significantly gained weight and been VERY tired over the past couple of years--then again, I have been in college/grad school for the past couple of years as well. I just recently met with my doctor to see if I could change my prescription. She told me that Cymbalta over time can cause liver damage (just what a 21+ year old wants to hear!), and that over 60 mg, the effects aren't very significant on depression/anxiety, but the symptoms of course increase. So we have decided to slowly wean me off of Cymbalta and hopefully onto a more effective medicine. Today is my first day reducing my dosage to 90 mg. I am very nervous about potential side effects (especially with finals in 6 weeks). But I hope someday I can feel just a tad bit more ""normal,"" or less tired, sad, and anxious. "

687$Major Depressive Disorder$9/6/2013 10:43:02 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been on Cymbalta at 60mg for 3 months and so far I think it's wonderful. Before this I was on Pristique and I would have episodes of uncontrollable crying and anxiety. I weaned off it for about 3 weeks before getting on Cymbalta and that was an awful thing to go through. Cymbalta helped me right away. Cymbalta has helped me feel more like myself and I can go on with my normal daily activities. Pristique and other anti-depressants have made me feel foggy. Cymbalta does not do this to me. I've had trouble sleeping with other medicines and with cymbalata I occasionally wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom but then fall right back asleep. I'm not so sure if that is a direct relation to the medication or not. I also have bad gas occasionally (not uncontrollable, just stinky) but i'm not sure if it is a side affect and if it is it is very minor compared to the benefits. I haven't experienced any weight gain/loss and I follow a healthy diet. Cymbalta is working for me but won't work for everyone. Pristique was horrible for me but is great for others. Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain (in most cases) and everyone is different. So I encourage you to try it and keep trying until you find the right one.
688$Major Depressive Disorder$9/6/2013 8:14:35 AM$Reviewer: MED CHOICE , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$1$5$Cymbalta is excellent medication the choice is yours. The good: Cymbalta is extremely excellent medication for Sevier pain condition with no other medications camper 10/10. Best medication for anxiety,panic attacks and depression with no other medications camper 9/10. The Cymbalta side effects are last for 30 days from start to withdraw same side effects when start cymbalta to does change up or down to withdraw cymbalta you going to experience same side effects when you started on day one. The bad: Cymbalta minor side effects going away once you get used to it and the other harsh side effects will start as long as you on cymbalta and last 3 months after first day withdrew cymbalta. Cymbalta make you become suicidal if you have a lots of friends you going lose most of them if you are married your marriage will fall apart if you are a professional you going to loss your profession if you're family lover you going lose it,basically you lose one by one as you go on with cymbalta. When you read all the reviews people say good things and bad things about cymbalta but you experience all of it slowly one by one. Cymbalta does effects the liver the most if you're alcohol drinker stop you going lose your liver,don't take any herbal supplement it will cause liver damage if you have liver disease tell your doctor and ask your doctor give you liver function test every 3 months even you're healthy person with no liver problem. The bottom line is your choice between your health conditions and Cymbalta personally I don't recommend to anyone. If your conditions worse nothing works except cymbalta go for it again that's your choice every one saying different things what ever is the best for you or your loved one.

I had more energy and had lost some weight but noticed that I was having increased anxiety episodes. After about 2 months of taking the medication I went out and had a couple of drinks with friends and after a couple of drinks I completely blacked out and started acting totally out of control. I can’t believe the way I was told I was acting and have absolutely no recollection of the night. I stopped Cymbalta immediately after this event. I goggled black outs and drinking on Cymbalta and was relieved that I was not the only one that had experienced this.
703$Major Depressive Disorder$8/20/2013 8:28:27 PM$Reviewer: Old Southern Soul, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$"Good, but new dilemna. 

About two years ago I was very frustrated that Wellbutrin, wasnt working, and adding an antianxiety helped some...but not for long. I stopped the Wellbutrin and eventually the antianxiety but soon realized even the Wellbutrin did ""something"" for me if not much. I thought the antianxiety was responsible for tired feeling and lack of energy, so stopped that.

Doctor suggested trying about 15 months ago Cymbalta @ 60, and as most of these reviews state, its great. Happier than ever, calm, but very normal. Sleepiness returned, even more. Have gained about 15 pounds which may or may not be the result of Cymbalta. Have also noticed some pain in my knees went away...but never had treatment for it since it was never too severe, so maybe Cymbalta has nothing to do with that.

I still feel extremely tired a lot, sleep more than 8 or 9 hours and still want a nap. Lack of energy. It doesn't seem to be an effect of Cymbalta by the literature or other reviews, but nothing so far has shown up through other tests. I did suggest dropping dosage to 30, but after 2 weeks realized that wasn't a good idea as I lost the beneficial effects for depression (felt about same as when I was on Wellbutrin)and it did not ease the sleepiness. So I have maintained the 60mg dosage.  I almost always feel great so I am happiest ever to have this. However, I still wrestle with the fatigue, and actually feel little like exercising, etc, it really gets to me. Diet, vitamins are all good. I hide my laziness from others but my weight is starting to show. This side effect to me seems tied to Cymbalta. 

The new dilemna is this: my insurance told me that at the end of this year they will no longer provide insurance for Cymbalta and to seek alternatives. My doctor is aware but we have yet to create plan B. I cannot afford this, so will have to change. All these bad reviews have to do with withdrawing for one reason or another but the withdrawal is the horror story I will have to deal!"

711$Major Depressive Disorder$8/12/2013 3:28:01 PM$Reviewer: webgurl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$2$My Primary Care MD (PCMD) put me on Welbutrin and Trazodone over 12 years ago and then added Cymbalta about 8 years ago as it did not appear that Welbutrin alone was helping ease my stress-related depression.  I can never truly say that any of them helped but looking back, I did see intermittent improvements.  I then had a serious nervous breakdown two years ago when a co-worker (sibling) destroyed my career and reputation.  I have been unable to work since then.  I knew I needed help.  The referral to a Psychiatrist (PMD) seemed appropriate in view of my depression and suicidal thoughts.  My PMD increased the doses of Cymbalta and Welbutrin, kept the Trazodone the same but also added Lamictal, Ativan,  Deplin and Lovaza.  I am still here, thanks to much of his guidance. But, it has now been two years that I am on this medication regimen, and I have stopped taking many of the drugs on my own with the exception of the Welbutrin, Trazodone, and Ativan  which seem to work well together-at least in my case.  I stopped taking Lamictal, Lovasa and Deplin over two months ago and felt pretty good.  Cymbalta withdrawal was next as it has been my goal to take none of them, if possible.  My doctor had me go from 120 mg to 60mg per day.  I started seeing some side effects (discussing those with my PMD) but finally made my own choice to stop altogether. Cymbalta withdrawal has been a living nightmare.  I cry at the drop of a hat, suffer from horrible stomach problems, diarrhea, inability to eat and have wretched brain zapping. Lest we not forget the rash which any one of those drugs may have caused.  A rash so bad I have scratched and bitten myself to stop the itching. The itching seems to be tapering off slowly.  While trying to recover from a nervous breakdown, I have lost control of caring for myself.  Who survives Cymbalta withdrawal without more drugs? I am seeking a natural serotonin replacement which will not kill me. Thank you for allowing me to share my story.

I actually had the urge to go out and LIVE life instead of just existing.
Sadly, my blood pressure began to rise, so my doc had to wean me off Cymbalta (OUCH!) and we played the med game again.  Which one was going to work?  For me, none did.  So, I made some life changes, started taking BP medication and he put me back on the Cymbalta. At my next visit, I actually hugged him for giving me back my life.

At first it was okay, and then I started to have these crazy nightmeres every night. EVERY NIGHT. I decreased my dosage and then the nightmeres left. However, this small dose wasnt enough for me, more like a sugar pill. So I recently switched to Viibryd. This drug is okay, just felt some nausia (sp)? if I dont take it with food, and it works the same for me, as a mood stabalizer/anxiety pill. The only thing I have noticed it that over the past week the nightmeres started to come back. And I'm not talking ""white sheet ghost"" nightmeres. Like some down right twisted scarey shit that I didnt even know I had it in me to think up this stuff. I have been looking for people who have had similar sideeffects to cymbalta, but havent really found anyone who has had night terrors. "

860$Major Depressive Disorder$3/14/2013 3:44:57 AM$Reviewer: laurj, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$2$2$Cymbalta did help my depression/anxiety problems and may have helped my muscle pain but it gave me a rash.  I got small round red patches that skin would crust over like a scab and flake off of and if I did not use clotrimizole on it, it got redder and redder til it would bleed.  It itched and was painful. Unfortunately, the cause wasn't obvious, and for years I suffered with this. I went to 4 dermatologists who acted like they knew just what it was but their prescription didn't work. They all said not to use clomitrizole but it was my only relief. Finally, Dr. tried to increase my dose of cymbalta from 30 to 60, and then to 90 and the rash was worse than ever, and the lightbulb finally went on above my head. I stopped taking cymbalta very gradually because it reeked havoc with my stomache with each tiny bit I decreased. The rash was gone for the first time in years I didn't have one of those painful itchy spots.  I was without the rash for 3 months when my depression problems came back. I tried cymbalta again and the rash came back worse than ever.  I hope this helpful to anyone with skin problems of any kind. Test for yourself and don't put all your faith in doctors telling you it has nothing to do with your meds. And read side effects and warnings in more than one place. I had to read a lot of info til I found the warning in small print to discontinue if you get a skin flaming rash. I should have run across that warning a lot sooner.

1) that its half life time is so short.
2) that it is only available in 30mg and 60 capsules.

I started with 30mg in the morning in hospital (had a very deep episode) and it gave me some help with my agitation and panic attacks after a few days.
But it was not enough. I was very numbed and one of my key problems - anhedonia was very serve. After trying 60mg in the morning after some days I was sucidial with serve agitation and anxiety. After two weeks not getting better I went back to 30mg and after 2 days anxienty and agitation was gone again.
After 3 months I found my medication:
ONLY 7,5mg - 7,5mg - 7,5mg (have to open the capsule)
and 25mg Ritalin in the morning.

My old doc said that this dosage is not enough but i have tried it several times - with more cymbalta and with less cymbalta and everytime after some days things got really bad.
I have pleassure to work and some pleassure in activities with friend and one of the best things: My libido has returned after 3 years.
I take in addition to that 6,5mg Metafolin and 1,5g buffered vit c the day and I think this stuff works too! "

I lost two jobs while on this medication.  I believe it was due to my outward appearance as well as my demeanor to my employer as a result of the drug.

I would sweat profusely and was always hot.  The medication caused me to stutter and shake like I was under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol.  I was easily agitated and did not care about others feelings and was self absorbed. I didn't have an appetite.  My dreams at night were like a Quenton Tarantino film.  I was a hot manic mess and would do things impulsively.

Nothing noticed until 2 weeks after I'd been taking it.  Then a little mood boost on the surface only (still depressed deep down) and some anxiety relief as well as just more patience with people in general.  Side effects of increased appetite(but no subsequent weight gain) and abnormal sleep periods also began after 2 weeks but the sleep cycle got back to normal after another month.  Unfortunately after 2 months the mood boost and anxiety relief were gone and I was back to my normal levels.  Didn't pursue a dosage increase though in retrospect maybe I should have.

I'll preface by saying I'm extremely sensitive to medication. Given time, Cymbalta does help lift your mood and dial down pain. However, I was only taking 20 mg tritrating up to 40 mg, and suffered numerous side effects: my brain never shut off - disruptive strange dreams felt like the TV had been left on in my head every night, plus nausea, fever/chills/sweating/achiness like flu (only first week), extreme drowsiness, blurred vision. Once I adapted, I stayed on for 3 months and did find relief, to the point I felt good enough to get off it. But when I needed it again 6 mos later, I only tried 20mg and had to quit after a week - I couldn't even go to the office. I felt like I'd been hit by a Mack truck. 

Cymbalta flattens out the mood to pleasant- no big highs or lows. I did not feel suicidal as they warn you might (only when I'm on no antidepressant do I feel that way!). But I wanted to feel like myself again; it was like watching myself from the outside, in a movie.

Be careful weaning off! Give your brain a chance to adapt slowwwly; never stop cold turkey! I've just been RX'd Elavil because I asked for something in low dose (10mg) in tablet form and can be cut in 1/2. You need to work with your Dr to find what's best for YOU."

I have been bipolar for years and have used many drugs and this is the worst of all of them.  One night I started getting really confused while doing my job as a route delivery driver to retail stores.  I called my father who is elderly because I did not know what else to do and I was confused.  He called my employer and took me to the hospital.  It struck me as odd right off the bat that they put me in a room with a person with liver failure?  Then finally after days of testing a group of 4 doctors visited me before I was released and gave me the diagnosis.  I had hepatic encephalopothy  or water on the brain from a liver problem they claimed was caused by this drug.  While I made a full recovery I must say that when they say on the television ""liver problems sometimes fatal"" have been reported they mean it.  Of course the original prescribing doctor wanted to argue with the diagnosis of the 4 hospital doctors and I told him off and fired him in a dramatic way.  Now after years on meds for bipolar I must say I think this is the most dangerous drug I have ever taken and I cannot urge people enough to try other options before trying this drug.  Water on your brain is a sign of a failing liver and my doctors insist that this drug caused it. Thankfully there has been no permanent damage that is showing and my liver function tests are back in normal range.  I am afraid of this drug.   "

1188$Major Depressive Disorder$6/1/2012 11:47:58 PM$Reviewer: KC57, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$"Today I took one Cymbalta 20mg for the first time, after weaning off of Remeron the past 4 nights.  Every Doctor for the past 2 years told me the Remeron was supposed to help me sleep, but it kept me awake 2-3 hours after taking it.  It also stimulated my appetite 1 hour after taking it.  So it put 10 lbs on me.  When I changed pharmacies earlier this year due to my insurance, my new pharmacist told me Remeron can cause insomnia.

So I talked to my new doctor, and he prescribed Cymbalta.  But after taking it once today around noon with food, it made me very sleepy and just ""weird"" feeling in my head the rest of today.  I had to talk with clients on the phone today, and I had trouble getting my thoughts together and my words out to them... not good !

After the Cymbalta wore off a little about 4 hours later, then my anxiety kicked in.  So I have been taking Ativan for anxiety, but I played it safe today, taking only 1/4 of my 1mg Ativan, and even that small amount made me more sleepy and feeling weird in my head with the Cymbalta in my system.

Then I started feeling flushed in my head and chest.  So I am calling my Doctor tomorrow and I am not going to take anymore of it.  I just can't be that sleepy and ""out of it"" during the day due to my job.

I have also tried Wellbutrin for 1 month which caused major insomnia, and then it took 3 weeks to wean off of it which also caused ""rebound insomnia""... that is one very bad med, at least for me.

I also have tried Lexapro which didn't help.
I have tried Paxil, but stopped it after 2 days of very painful sexual side effects.

So I don't know what else my Doctor can prescribe for me.  I have felt so rotten for over 2 years now with little energy.
I started taking a year ago Vit D pills and increased the iron in my diet, as both levels were very low a year ago.  My recent blood test showed both levels are now in the normal range.

So I hope this posting helps someone else out there."

I was had to relocate my children with friends for a minimum of 2 weeks until she was under control.  things are better now, but not even close to normal.  This drug needs to be re-evaluated again as a treatment.  we were told my wife will never be normal again now that her manic attack happened.  this is by partial in our decision to get treatment from an md not a psychiatrist for what we thought was mild depression. if this is warns at least one person from taking this med, then it was all worth writing.  thanks for listening.

He started me out on 30 mg and has since increased the dose to 120 mg. This is the best antidepressant I've tried. In addition it helps control my chronic back pain. The medication has enabled me to reduce the amount of Lortab from 6 per day to 1-3 per day.

I have tried over twelve medications.  I also take this medication for neuropathic pain.  I've had type 1 diabetes for 23 years.  I haven't noticed a significant reduction in pain.  Lyrica is a medication that helps my nerve pain. The only side effects I've
noticed is reduced sex drive and some ED.  I'm taking Viagra to treat this side effect and well worth taking, even with this side effect.  Be sure to start low and build up.  Some Dr's just don't get this!  I take 3 20mg tablets daily.  I can tolerate the medication better when taken in 2-3 doses daily.  I had a headache when taking 30mg or 60mg once daily.  I could tolerate taking 2 30mg at this point.  I've taken Cymbalta for 5 years.  

The medication is expensive, but covered by my insurance.  I took Paxil for 8 years and found Cymbalta a much more effective drug.  "

It eased my anxiety, and made me remember what it was like to enjoy life again.  I went from being numb, and wishing for death on a nightly basis to feeling that warm fuzzy feeling of love and happiness again.  Cymbalta changed my life.  The withdrawal effects sucked.  there is no other word to describe it. Hypersensitivity, a manic phase, was my experience.  I suggest if this drug is started, DO NOT get off it. As long as it is taken consistently, it has been one of the BEST depression medications I have ever taken.  Due to price, I am taking Prozac, but personally, I dont feel it is nearly as good.
1232$Major Depressive Disorder$4/22/2012 1:59:20 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$4$This was ok for depression and pain for a short time.  However, have used for 8 years, and it should be taken off the market and not prescribed.  Turns one into a zombie, has horrible effect on memory, takes away any sexual desire or ability to have orgasm, and creates anger at the drop of a hat.  Have to use a very slow tapering system to withdraw from it, and most doctors have no clue that this is needed, and they tell people they need it for the rest of their lives.  Big Pharma and the uneducated docs who hand out pills like candy are harming people.

The first month: heavy side effects, sweating, dry mouth, decrease in sex drive, weight gain. The first year: Went from 30MG to 60MG, things got better, even thought maybe this was the answer. Depression cloud gone for the most part, anxiety rare. BUT NOT 100%. Last 6 months: depression cloud has snuck back in, sex drive still dead, wake up early for no reason and can't go back to sleep, foggy headed, forgetful, spacey, last week I determined it is time to find a new drug. 

I originally chose this drug to help with BOTH anxiety AND depression, in the end, neither really were corrected. The side effects are manageable ONLY IF you are well, otherwise what's the point?

The drug has helped for the tingling feeling feet/hands lower legs, it does not help for complete loss of feeling. It's side effects are complete loss of sexual activity.(severe ED and frustation) It has helped with the severe mood swings and severe anxiety(almost to the point of giving up)But have noticed that at time of high stress that by the time it ""kicks in"" you sort of go into a flat-numb emotion zone for hours.(I am on 120mg/day dose) Also I have found out that you can group all Law Enforcement into the (BUGS BUNNY ""WHAT A BUNCH OF MAROONS"") catagory! I have been checked in airports,TMA and DEA, and Local cops ( after altercation in parking lot door dinger,related to local prosecutor) That stated I was acting under the influence and showed signs of Under Influence, even though I did not feel that way! However I am now forced to go to court ordered drug monitoring KAPS-Kentucky to someone that did not even know , what kind of drug this was,and /or is used for, other than he has seen it advertised on TV!LOL Overall it does not seem to prevent what it was prescribed for it just sort of knocks the top off of it !

I am now trying to find a good ""mood stabilizer"" with my doctor. Had 2 MD's explain to me that mood stabilizers are first line of treatment and THEN the anti-depressant. My treatment has been backwards, only b/c I failed to be honest w/practitioner and didn't tell her I had been diagnosed in past w/Bipolar. So tell your MD eveything. Although I have been told to stop the Cymbalta and ONLY take mood-stabilizer, I just can't and won't give up my cymbalta. Just hope these MD's can work my treatment backwards but it has been wonderful for me--Also helps with my anxiety"

Not sure if it ever helped my depression problem or if changes in my life were really the culprit. Anyway I was remarried a year ago to the most wonderful woman who is a lifelong nurse and suggested I try to come off the cymbalta. I tried decreasing to 90 mg and after about 4-5 days was met with terrible brain shocks and just an awful overall feeling physically and mentally. I went back on 120 mg so we went to a neurologist who suggested I alternate days between 120mg and 90mg. Perfect! Never a bad day. I did this for one month, then started only 90mg a day and have not had a problem. (started 90mg daily two weeks ago) Our plan is in two more weeks to start alternating days of 90 and 60mg. Yeah!!! It will take time but I will eventually be off this stuff. The side effects while not horrible, are numerous for cymbalta. Mine are: Non-existent sex drive, difficulty urinating(not prostate problem), fatigue, sleepiness, vivid dreams, lack of any drive. God sent me my the most caring and understanding support system, my wife, and that has helped ten-fold. I wish anyone wanting to quit this drug the best and please come off slowly. That's the key.

Was given it instead of Pristiq because I was getting massive migraines from the Pristiq (I took it for a whopping week)  Cymbalta has done a lot for migraines and headaches, and makes me feel less depressed and anxious.  I was started out on 60mg and after a few weeks started getting edgy and irritable.  Doc had me go back to taking Abilify 2mg along with the 60mg Cymbalta and it seemed alright for a while, but I drive for a living and also live 45-60 minutes from the garage I start out of each morning, and was having trouble with falling asleep while driving!  I dropped the Abilify and they had lowered my Cymbalta to 30mg and so far so good.  I feel alright, mostly normal, the only issue I have is if I miss a dose, about half way through the next day I start getting major dizziness and motion sickness.
1326$Major Depressive Disorder$2/1/2012 8:44:57 AM$Reviewer: R Vogel, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$4$"I have taken Cymbalta since early 2010.  It has really helped with my depression.  I have also attended counseling.  However, I have suffered from severe periods of nauseau and upper stomach pain.  IT is so bad that I have been to the ER several times.  (Usually treated like I am having drug withdrawls...not fun!!!)  I ended up having ulcers, gastritis and having my gall bladder removed. (Which seemed to be the problem...)  However, the periods of nausea, upset stomach and sickness are still very bad. The surgey was 3 months ago.  I am very careful what I eat.  My ulcers have cleared- but still have gastritis- inflammation of the stomach...The only other medication that I take on a regular basis is Protonix- to help heal ulcers and inhibit stomach acid production.   

I have found that taking 60 mg of Cymbalata on an empty stomach - makes me feel very hot, sweaty,my stomach knots up. and usually it is so bad that I throw-up!!  It seems like taking a split dose of 30 / 30 creates less stomach upset.  However, I have to watch taking the 2nd 30 mg too late in the day or I have trouble sleeping.
I have to say I am very worried about the effects that Cymbalta has on my body and I think it would be smarter for me to find another medication for my depression.... 

After reading rare side effects- I have seen nausea, stomach pain warnings and wonder about Cymbalta's effect on liver.  Through the years- I have taken antidepressants on and off for 25 years- so, I have been on most- (forgive my spelling) TCA's, prozac, zoloft, paxil, lexapro, effexor.. also combo trials with abilify, zyprexia, lithium, geodone, etc.  My problem doesn't seem to be a bipolar issue- more depression. Cymbalta seem to work best- as a stand alone-  I am still investigating..

We initially tried 30 mgs a day while weaning off the Celexa. Once on Cymbalta alone I  noticed that some improvement but not enough. We increased to 60 a day and my sense of well being improved gradually over 5 or 6 months. I've been on Cymbalta now for about 8 months and really feel the most 'normal' that I've felt in over 5 years. I've regained focus, I hvae the desire to do things I haven't felt up to (i.e.: exercise, enjoy hobbies...)in years. 

The major side effect for me is excessive sweating or hot flashes. It can be a little off putting but not enough to make me want to switch at this time. I also experience 'brain zaps' if I miss my dosing time by more the 24 hours. Of late I've had a sour milk taste and dry throat; however, I'm hoping that has more to do with an atibiotic I had to take after oral surgery I recently had. 

Over all I'm pretty satisfied with my experience thus far on Cymbalta"
1362$Major Depressive Disorder$1/8/2012 3:04:55 AM$Reviewer: SonnyZ, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $1$1$3$I was on Cymbalta for about five years and developed major problems that I did not realize were side effects for quite a while.  I experienced increased blood pressure, tinnitus, heart palpitations, muscle spasms, muscle rigidity and pain, muscle weakness, loss of short-term memory, increased depression, loss of interest in activities I had been passionate about my whole life.  I weaned myself off the medication and after a year I almost have my body back.  Muscle strength is returning, memory is back.  I have mood swings worse than before I went on it and still not much interest in my hobbies and activities.  That drug was a nightmare and should be banned.  I am convinced it caused a chemical imbalance in my brain rather than treating it.  I will never take this drug or any like it ever again.

(suffered from major depression, suicidal ideation, & self mutilation). Tried welbutrin, lexepro, & celexa. Cymbalta side effects for me: occasional stomach upset/burning; Tums relieves this, also omeprazole. I do get flu like symptoms (body aches/fatigue) if I miss a dose or am late with a dose.  For me, the best time of day to take Cymbalta is at noon; bedtime dose kept me awake at night, morning dose made me sleepy in afternoon. I am so very happy I gave Cymbalta a try.  I have been taking it for 9 months now.  I recently started taking taking clonazepam for anxiety and it does not seem to interfere with Cymbalta.

Was on the generic effexor 100 mg since my insurance stopped paying for brand. Just was not working. My doctor had me take 50 mg of effexor (venlafaxine) along with the 30 mg of Cymbalta for 7 days. Then I started my 60 mg last night and will not be taking the eddexor. My question is to anyone who might can answer is: Does it matter if you take this med at night or should I take it every morning. I've always taken my anti-depression meds at night. Based on what I've read about this med it can also help with other types of problems such as low energy. I was dianosed with cancer 4/2004 and received chemo treatments two times pretty much back to back since my cancer came back a second time. I am now about 5 1/2 years in remission (Thank GOD), but I have had so many medical problems mainly from the chemo and 5 surgeries in 6 years with my last surgery 6/10. My energy level is so low and nothing I seem to do helps. Would appreciate any feed back. Thanks inadvance.

That was almost five years ago. The problem is trying to quit the medication. The side effects are so severe that it is easier to just keep taking it. The brain zaps are unbearable and it makes me feel as though I am losing my mind. Confusion, naseau and dizziness also. I can not emphasize enough about the brain zaps though. If your doctor recommends or prescribes Cymbalta, please think twice about it. If I had to do it over again, I would NEVER have taken it. Sad thing that the Dr. never warned me about the side effects. They must get a huge kickback from the drug manufacturer. Again, please think twice before taking!

I also suffer from Fibromyalgia, and before this med I could only go from the bed to the couch each day and dreaded having to get up to do anything at all because of the pain.  Now I have my LIFE back again. I feel human, and can do things I want to do without feeling pain, my depression is under control (I'm happy), and my anxiety is at a stand-still without having to take other meds that make me feel doped-up all the time.  I'm aware that some of these reviews may scare you away from wanting to try Cymbalta, but I have never even heard of a ""brain zap"", and never experienced any of the things these people are talking about. Different meds work differently for different people, and Cymbalta just may be RIGHT for you, like it is for ME!  So, don't shy away from it because of these other reviews.  It truely is a wonderful, lifesaving med, and I'm so thankful for it.  I'm alive again, painfree, and happy! Best of luck to you and May God Bless you like he has me. "

Not long after starting I kept having these episodes feeling like ""brain zaps""As soon as I lay down at night the zaps would start. Then they started to occur during the day. If I missed a dose the zaps would be worse. My PCP took me off of it about a month ago and the ""brain zaps"" haven't stopped but they're not a bad or often. A few days ago one morning I was about to get out of bed and all of a sudden I heard a sound like quickly letting air from a balloon. It was so scary; I got up quickly and walked around to make sure I was okay. Long story short I drove myself to ER because The right side of my face & neck was feeling very tight, weak with severe pressure. Oh yeah I have RA, Fibromyalgia and a pinched nerve in my neck[worse on right side]. I was admitted in the hospital because they wanted to run tests[ CT, 3 MRI tests, Ultrasound on my neck & heart]to see if maybe I was having a stroke or aneurysm. My mom died [49 yrs old]from an aneurysm and my older sister had 2 aneurysms that was caught in time to have surgery. After all the tests they could not find anything which I am so very glad to know because I had been telling my PCP & my husband that there is something wrong in my brain. I am no longer on Cymbalta but this episode of ""brain zaps"" really scared me. I pray that if anyone that reads this review and are having symptons such as this please tell your PCP so you can be weaned off this drug. I was weaned from 1[20mg]capsule 2 times a day to 1 time a day until I was finally taken off. My experience with Cymbalta has been very very very SCARY. "

Remember a sick society is profitable to Insurance, Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry. If they were to cure you the world would over populate and a very large sector of the financial markets would collapse and destroy the world economy. An economic system based in Hegelian Dialect simply no longer works anymore. But like with all elites they must run it into the ground until it is self evident their way isnt correct. Unfortunately the big brains always think they can pull it off one more time.

My husband and I are going to start trying to conceive in the next year so I am tapering off the 60 mg to the 30mg, and then off of it before we get pregnant...but I plan to resume taking it as soon as I am done breastfeeding.
Not every drug works the same for everyone. Prozac made me suicidal, and lexapro made me FAT, there are always pros and cons to ANY medication...but for me, cymbalta has saved me and my relationships at time."

1491$Major Depressive Disorder$9/21/2011 10:42:01 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$4$This drug is terrible and should come with warnings on the bottle. People need to be aware of what this drug can do to you. The company or companies that supply this drug purposely hide the truth from the public about this drug and others like it. I was on Cymbalta 60mg for about 2 years and the symptoms got so bad i had to quit taking it and the withdrawal from this drug is one of the worst and i almost had to go to the hospital several times. These drugs can make your symptoms worse and even add new ones. I would advise anyone not to take them without weighing the risks and determining yourself whether your symptoms are bad enough to risk taking a dangerous medicine like Cymbalta. The withdrawal from this medicine is terrible, getting off this drug is said to be like getting off a narcotic. The withdrawal i went through made me wish i had never come into contact with this medicine or any like it. It was the worst week and a half of my life and i would do anything to never have to go through it again.

I have other symptoms that could be attributed to Cymbalta, but could also be caused by an interaction with other drugs I am on.  I am changing this drug because of the unacceptable weight gain, loss of concentration and motivation, and extreme sleepyness.

In the beginning I had only minor side effects and they went away after a few weeks. The one side effect that has never gone away is a slight upset stomach right after swallowing the pills. I think this is due to the fact that the pills float. It takes a little getting used to swallowing floating pills. Overall I am very happy with this medicine. It has been the best medicine for me that I have ever tried. I also financially qualify for patient asisstance from the manufacturer so I get my medicine with no charge. Just a few forms to fill out. There is no, one-right-medicine-for-everyone, out there so if you try this medicine and it doesn't work for you just keep trying with your doctor to find one that does. I've tried ones that seem to have no effect and others that make me soooooo sick I think I'm dying I'm in so much pain. Cymbalta has worked for me and I intend to continue taking it for a long time.

To begin with it was extremely helpful with my moods and general feelings of depression. It has now become less affective and I am looking for an alternative. I experienced the normal symptoms of feeling like I would vomit (but never did) for approximately 8 months that subsided eventually. I also get what is referred to as 'serotonin' dreams where I have extremely vivid and life like dreams due to this antid. I hate this of course as it often leaves me waking up wondering if I recovered a memory instead of knowing I have just had another dream. This disheartens me greatly as I lived with depression for a number of years due to previously trying a number of antid's and getting hideous side effects until I tried Cymbalta. Now I am only left with the choice to see a psychiatrist to use me as a lab rat to test different drugs as no doctor ever knows exactly how you will react to a certain drug and the side effects you may have. Please don't let what I have written freak you out I just believe that knowledge is power and hope that maybe I could help someone. Thanks, good luck and never stop trying to love yourself.

The first year was great and all my depression symptoms went away. However I have noticed a few negative side affects...prior to taking cymbalta I never had anxiety now I get it quite often and have had many anxiety/panic attacks. My over all health has gone down in last few years...about 30 pounds of weight gain, high blood pressure, and severe migrane attacks (never had those prior either), and more recently hypothyroidism. Not positive these things are related to the cymbalta use but deffintly the aniexty and migranes. The absolute worst part of cymbalta is attempting to wean off of it. I have made a few attempts, this last time I gradually wean down over a period of 4 months. I got all the way down to only 20mg every other day, but the withdrawls were unbearable! Yes, physically painful in muscle's and joint's as well as terrible migranes and vertigo, mood swings, and anxiety. I feel like I'm a prisoner to cymbalta, I hate it...and regret the day I agreed with my doctor to begin use. Before beginning cymbalta do research on the side effects and withdrawl symptoms of going off...I wish I did! My doctor now tells me it is one of the hardest anti-depressants to quit.

This is a follow up to my previous review. The dizzy spells, loose stools, random pains have stopped. I now suffer from ringing/hissing in the ears, insomnia, and RLS. I have not suffered from any of these ailments before I started taking Cymbalta. My psychiatrist prescribed me Sinequan today to help with the insomnia and RLS. I will report back after I can tell if this has helped at all. I am still nervous about the ringing/hissing in the ears, as that may be a sign of high blood pressure, something that I read in these reviews is caused by Cymbalta. I am concerned about this complicating my health.

I was on Abilify until last summer and went of due to the huge amount of weight gain. I refuse to go back on it. Another prescription (cannot remember the name ) was so upsetting...I could not swallow without rubbing my throat - even just saliva, I could not walk, I couldn't talk, and my body was in constant restlessness. Like restless leg syndrone. I just take it one day at a time and refuse to take anymore meds. When i took abilify I was not capable of driving until my body got use to it.

I have been on it for about 17 days now and I feel better mentally (meaning I seem to ""care"" more about things: showering, cleaning, exercising, etc) but I have been feeling poor physically. Since I started the Cymbalta I have been experiencing moderate to severe stomach upset - including gas pains, loose stools, frequent movements, painful movements, etc. I also have been experiencing nausea and dizziness. For example, I will be driving down the road and all of a sudden a wave of dizziness will overcome me where I feel the road is slanting or I feel like I am going to pass out behind the wheel. It is very scary and quite unnerving. I also have been experiencing ""shots"" of pain in odd places throughout my body. My wrist, or calf, or most recently behind my left eye. These ""shots"" of pain only last 30 to 40 seconds but are severe enough to make me wince and cringe until they are over. I also have been finding it more difficult to sleep at night, and nearly impossible to stay asleep during the night. I might ask my psychiatrist for a sleep aide to remedy this situation, as nearly all OTC sleep medicines I have used do not help for long periods of time. I also don't like capsule beads. A few positives: I feel my sex drive is back 110% - I want it all the time, multiple times a day. I can not seem to get enough. This is a welcomed side effect from my boyfriend, after a LONG dry spell under Lexapro. I am also finding my appetite to be smaller, sometimes I have to force myself to eat (though that is very rare). I also find myself having much less lower back aches and pains. I am concerned about all I am reading regarding negative side effects and withdrawals. I will have to discuss this further with my psychiatrist. I also feel I may need an anti anxiety medication to get me through those times when a single anti-depressant doesn't cut it. I hope to report back when I have been on this dosage a little longer."

Can't get off cymbalta cause it is the only thing keeping my severe ANXIEY down. 30mg doen't help w/ depression. can't take 40mg, side/effects. NOW I am restricted to 4 CUPS of any FLUIDS a day...Mt life is just getting worse and worse. Stuck in debiltating depression and still get major anxiety attacts in morning and take 2mg Ativan. ANd smoke cigarets and drink lots of coffee when anxiety attacks happen. Had 1 cup coffee & 1 cup water am. Now can only have 2 more cups of water today and thats it. EVERTinG was fine when I was on ZOLOFT 2007, 08, 09. THEN DR. bullied me into taking PROZAC cause I said I was ""kinda"" depressed. INtrrupted me before I could tell her I can't take Prozac. Took before and 1 pill made my head go crazy. Dr. ambushed so badly I coudn't think straight.Stupidly took it. Head went crazy on 15mg.told to lower it to 10mg and ANXIETY came back big time. No anxiety on Zoloft. Back to ZOLOFT and it gave me anxiety & killer headaches. Weaned off and hit w/ severe anxiety. Prescribed 5-6mg Ativan/day. Anxiety would not calm down after 5 months. SO last resort was Cymbalta. 30mg finally greatly reduced Anxiety, but still had to take ativan. Can;t get off Cymbalta cause of the anxiety. NOW got side-effect of Cymbalta which Low Sodium that sodium Dr. told me about. So thirsty. I want to commit suiside, but no garage for car.Afraid that my Ativan + klonopin will only cause me to overdose and end up in psych ward. Last place I want to be!!!!! New Srink wanted to to try ENMAM patch. FInd out can;t take Ensam of on any ssi or ssni. SHRINK would have killed me!!!!! NOW you know why I want to kill myself..AND Prozac gave me Permanent Anxiety!!!!"

However, after adjusting to the medication I no longer have any of the bad side effects and all the good. 

Now i have no more 'crying fits' due to my depression. If you can get past 2 weeks this drug just may be for you. 

Please don't miss more than a couple dosages. Your symptoms will start to come back . I forgot to take for 3 days and I become very lightheaded every time i stood up.

I never realized how much it had helped with back pain, which is not why I was taking it.  It's not a great alternative to all the options out there.  But, it's important to remember that medications work differently on each of us.  Do as much research as possible, before you make the decision, and let discuss it with your doctor and why you want whatever medication you choose, if you're doctor is a good doctor they will listen and help you, if they don't find another doctor.  There is hope for all of us, we just may have to take different meds to get there.  Good luck, everyone.

Thought this would be better since it also had the extra effect of helping neuropathic pain, which I have.  I already take Neurontin for that. And Ultram.  Not long after starting this, I became so ill, dizzy, nauseous.  I couldn't move my head from a pillow.  Slowly weaned myself off and back on Wellbutrin.  Soooo glad I wasn't on longer than a month and didn't have to go through the withdrawals these people went through.  Just shows how everyone needs to be their own advocate and investigate what they are being given, because most doctors won't tell you what could happen. Or they don't know because they haven't looked into it, just had a salesman give them samples....

I have been on just about all antidepression medicines you can think of over the last 10 years and none of them work for long. I am now on cymbalta at highest does 120mg a day. It seemed to work well for a month or so but now I am back to being depressed alot. I am beginning to think nothing will work. With the cymbalta 120, i also take klonopin 1mg 4x's a day and concerta 36mg once a day. Some days I function and some days i dont get out of bed, shower, clean my house or anything. I wish they would find the right medication mix for me already. Have not really had any side affects from the cymbalta, I take it at night so it wont make me tired during the day no change in appetite(which is great because they had me on 600mg of seroquel xr and I gainded 40lbs in 2 months I told them I refused to take it anylonger) the only side affect of this medicine is that I have absolutely no sex drive at ALL, could be the medicine but could also be the depression.

Very interesting. Helps me to control the bad feelings and not go into downward spirals like before. Brain does feel ""foggy"" but it's not bad so far-- more like I'm very thoughtful and introspective when at rest. Instead of spending time doing escapist stuff like websurfing and playing games, I sometimes just sit and think about my life and what I could do to improve it. Seems like a healthy change. Appetite has decreased and I have less of a desire for junk food, in fact I've gotten addicted to muesli of all things. Takes longer to reach orgasm, especially compared to being on Wellbutrin, but when it does hit-- OH my GOD ;) I would have to have six in a row of those little firecracker Wellbutrin orgasms to reach the same intensity of my first one on this drug! So, not a bad trade-off. Sleeping DEEPLY for the first time in years. All in all, it's a good experience so far and I'm hopeful about the future."

I can enjoy things more and don't cry all the time. I used to feel physically sick from depression and was really sensitive to fluctuations of my blood sugar level but the Cymbalta has virtually eliminated those symptoms.  It has also helped alleviate anxiety and calmed racing thoughts.  I've definitely experienced decreased interest in sex and it is harder to reach orgasm and the orgasms are not as good, but it's worth it to not feel like killing myself.  Also, after about 3 months of being on it, my sex drive seems to be gradually increasing again and I can reach orgasm a little more quickly than when I first started the medication.  I also noticed an almost immediate increase in appetite which is annoying but I've been able to deal with it pretty well so far.

Took 30mg for a week, during which time I was nauseous, dizzy, and suffered some of the worst headaches of my life.  Increased to 60mg after that, and began to feel better mentally.  I actually could get through a day at work without bursting into tears for no reason, and I started feeling moments of happiness again.  The side effects during this time however were quite irritating.  I began to bite the inside of my mouth during sleep, and sometimes when awake and not even when eating! I ended up with painful mouth ulcers from repeated biting, and this lasted about a month after switching to the 60mg. I then began experiencing insomnia at night, and bouts of nearly narcoleptic drowsiness at work, along with shortness of breath and vertigo.  Then I got on the scale and realized with horror that I had gained 20 pounds!!! I had already gained 15 pounds in the 8 months prior to taking the medication.  I am willing to accept responsibility for THOSE pounds, because I sat home and ate like a pig for weeks after the suicide of my sister.  I was NOT prepared to gain 20 pounds in 3 months while working and eating healthfully.  The shock of being a 5'4"" female who now weighs close to 175 pounds was enough to send me into a three week drinking binge. So much for the few months of feeling slightly better.  I am now debating on whether or not to quit taking this medication, as some reviewers have suggested that it may cause further weight gain.  I am not prepared to deal with that, and I really wish they would list weight gain as a side effect on the patient info! I would NEVER have agreed to take this medication if I had known it were a possibility.  In summary, the damage that this medication has caused to my self esteem and my sex life are likely irreversible and I was probably less depressed before Cymbalta than I am right now."

He has become hostile and has a very aggressive, mean behavior pattern that has emerged over the last several months.  His skin has yellowed and he has hot flashes.  I think the drug is working on assisting him with the pain of the neuropathy, but the hostile behavior has most certainly overshadowed any pain relief.

The biggest downfall to the medication has been bruxism. I started clinching my teeth at night shortly after I started taking the medication and have had to have one tooth removed and three crowns as a result of cracking my teeth. It also causes headaches and muscle pain in my shoulders. I've tried every device known to doctors to stop the bruxism, but it continues. If not for that - and it is awful, I would call it a wonder drug.

I am considering asking my physician for a change in medications.  I haven't had many side effects except I have no sex drive whatsoever.  I'm not happy about it but it's better than crying all of the time.  I also do not like visiting with people or talking on the phone anymore. (Except my family.)

1770$Major Depressive Disorder$4/5/2011 1:54:34 PM$Reviewer: Kashy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"After trying just about every medication available in generic without success, my Dr. got the insurance to approve Cymbalta because it really works. Well, I should say, did work. The first 6 months on 90 mg, I felt great. Now, after about a year, some symptoms are getting stronger again. I will have to review with the Dr.
The only bad thing I can say about it is the missed-dose side effect: If I forget one dose, I get very dizzy the next day. It's very disturbing, but can be prevented if I take one capsule in the morning (usual dose is 3 capsules at night).
I have other aches and pains that Cymbalta doesn't affect at all, so I was surprised to learn here that it is used for arthritis/fibro pain.
I don't know if it's worth it if you don't have insurance, for me it was worth a try. Maybe I'll be put on a higher dose."

If I missed a dose, I would have HORRIFIC vertigo. I did not feel like myself, and honestly I am not sure how I functioned at work feeling that way, perhaps I didnt function well. I stopped taking the medication in 2008, due to losing my health insurance and I could not afford $130 dollars for the medication. I quit cold turkey. DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY. It was the WORST decision I could have EVER made. It was the most horrific withdrawl I could imagine. The withdrawl lasted about 2 months, and at that point I was only taking 20 mg. I had vertigo, irritation, agitation, headaches, did not want to be around anyone... I would go home from work and go to bed at 6PM and not get up until the following day. PLEASE consult your doctor before quitting this medication.I just want to stress the importance that quitting this med cold turkey especially after taking it so long is downright dangerous!

Not only is this life-threatening (all over the Cymbalta label, it says DO NOT TAKE WITH SSRI MEDICATION), he responded to my worsening condition by doubling my dose to twice the therapeutic level (120 mg/day- I refused). He'd already done the same with my Adderrall, which he's been using as a supplement to SSRI/SNRI medication to treat ""resistant symptoms."" I am prescribed 60 mg/day Adderrall; the therapeutic dose is 40. Additionally, he doubled my Klonipin, which was initially .5 mg/AM, .5 mg/noon, and 1 mg/bedtime. Now I'm on a total of 4 mg/day- again 2x the therapeutic dose. 

About 2 mos. into Cymbalta (1 mo. at 60 mg), I began to feel that something was very wrong. I am a therapist myself, so it took a LOT to call my psychiatrist's cell phone at 10PM 3 nights ago. He stated that he would follow up in the AM & probably call in a Lexapro prescription, because I was probably having withdrawal symptoms (you think? I've been on it for as long as I can remember and he tried to wean me in 4 weeks!)...and he only said this AFTER I suggested it. I also re-read ALL my prescription labels & learned that NONE of my medications should be taken all at once. I take Omeprazole for GERD, which is NOT supposed to be taken with Adderrall, as it prevents absorption in the gut. Cymbalta is not to be taken with antacids OR SSRIs (Lexapro), or Klonopin, or by people who smoke (I smoke), as nicotine depletes it in the bloodstream. Also, I cannot eat; I have no appetite, and have lost 20 lbs. since starting with this dr. in September...probably due to the unnecessarily high dose of Adderrall and the fact that a side effect of Cymbalta is appetite loss. I consume probably 600 calories a day, all liquids. I don't even notice until nighttime. I'm a 5'10"" female & wasn't overweight to start; now I just look sick.

I am not bipolar. Inpatient psychiatric care is a total crock. As long as you make your bed, go to group, go to meals they completely let you alone and NO ONE DOES ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM.The Psychiatrist sees you once or twice a week and says ""You have side effect from drug? No? OK, stay same"" That's it. At group they hand out worksheets ""how do you manage anxiety"" - BUT don't collect them. Psychiatry is a crock and these meds make you worse."

I had no emotions. I had no sex drive AT ALL. I had strange, vivid dreams. I had significant weight gain even though my dr insisted the medicine didn't cause weight gain.  I had a very FLAT feeling all the time...just numb all over.  

After weaning myself off the drug and finally quitting it completely I still have BAD withdrawal symptoms.  It has been almost a month since I have taken a full dose. Since then, I have had lose stools, shortness of breath, high blood pressure, ringing in the ears, weird sensations in my brain..like electrical ""zaps"", extreme dizziness, headaches, cannot concentrate, memory loss, nausea and just generally feel bad all over, like I have the flu. I am hoping all these feelings and symptoms go away soon.  I pray there is no permanent damage.

This is a life saver!!!  :)   I tried others but this one was the best - once it was completely in my system/I was past the point of my body & mind adjusting to it, which takes a good couple of months at least so give it a real chance to help.  I have gone off of it a few times, thinking I was better, only to realize each time how much it was truly helping me deal with the emotional & physical circumstances in my life - I have been through a series of huge life adjustments all at once.  I was married (1st time), instant step children, moved from CA to WA, new job, etc. So it felt like I had not only lost my entire family, church family, & friends with the move, but then there were 4 deaths in my family since I moved.  Plus I was dealing with the agony of physical pain & restrictions from doing most anything active because of the pain. Cymbalta really helped with my attitude about dealing/accepting all that was happening and kept me from emotional breakdowns.  It continues to just keep me stable and fairly happy despite my circumtsances!!!  :)   Try it, you'll like it!  May God Bless you. :)    xoxoxoxoxo

The only side effect I had was that it raised my blood pressure but we just added HCT to my Diovan for bp and it is fine now.  It also caused a little bit of jitteriness the first week or so that I was on it.  I've been able to sleep very well on this (I had previously tried Lexapro but it caused me major insomnia - so I am thrilled with the Cymbalta).

I suffered from major depression, anxiety, as well as constant pain in my neck and shoulders. There was an adjustment period of about a month before the pills sort of leveled out in my system. At first i experienced disorientation, loss of appetite,trouble focusing and an overall loopy feeling but after a month I didn't have those issues.The only long term issues I have had are dry mouth, sweating, and if I forget a dose I have awful nightmares but in comparison to the way I felt before these are all tolerable side effects. An added bonus for me was the pain I was experiencing completely stopped in the first week after starting the meds. I had no idea that the pain I was having was a symptom of my depression/anxiety and had been numerous times to doctors for it with out ever finding out what was the cause or getting any relief. I would say my experience has with cymbalta has been good overall. 
1848$Major Depressive Disorder$2/18/2011 2:58:17 PM$Reviewer: knowdepression, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I took this medication for less than two weeks. I felt origionally felt 'weird', somewhat 'stupid' and dizzy or disorientated.  After the second week, I thought most of odd effects had calmed. I drove over 100 miles to visit with life-long freinds (no driving difficulities) but with in 10 minuites of my arrival, my friends began to condem me for having driven drunk.  They had known me all my life - knew I've never drank - yet I was not able to convince them that I was not drunk/drinking...  In the few years since, I have meet several people that I could tell were on Cymbalta (and found I was correct).  I call it the 'Cymbalta Stare', sort of a glazed, empty look to their face and eyes.  They respond to my offered friendship by asking if I'd like to hear their favorite CD, see a movie, etc... but within minutes they've forgotten they were looking for that CD, or what whatever activity it may have been and polietly say they would like to take a nap or other comment. They tend to invite me to their home, room, (comfort zone), then within minutes are ready to be left alone.  I've also watched friends insolate themseves, display extreme depressive behaviors, and become totally disfunctional while remaining on this med for 2 and 3 years.  The ""Cymbalta Stare"" should be a big signial that this drug is not right for those individuals."

What do you mean by satisfaction? You can be satisfied during the time of using it, but what happens when you try to withdraw from this medication? You can check online on a few forums talking about this med. It sucks. Try to stop it and things will go upside down. DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY on this pill. Some common withdrawal effects are, on my experience, but not limited to: panics, crying, severe feeling of depression, stomachache, ear buzz, terrible pains allover your body.

I took this medicine for 3 years. Not only has my weight been hard to manage, I have not slept at all , had horrible muscle problems, my blood pressure has sky rocketed, but worst of all I have had some anger and irritability that scares me. When I decided I had enough I told my doc I was going off it. He advised me to wean off for the last 3 months. Every month I went down  30 mg, until today i am on none. The withdrawals have been HELL- I do not say that lightly. I know this stuff is poison, i have had the most vivid scary nightmares a person  could have. I also have had some rage that freaks me out. Please do yourself a favor do not take this crap. If you are a Doctor try to heed a patients warning,the risks and side effects are not worth it.Humans are not meant to be chemistry experiments. Be informed read any patient reviews on any meds, herbs that you put in your body. There many ways to get through depression without meds.i hope someone can be helped by what I shared, hang in there , things will get better.

1937$Major Depressive Disorder$12/3/2010 4:04:20 PM$Reviewer:  (Patient) $5$5$3$"okay nothing is perfect.  i find that taking the SMALLEST possible dose is IMPORTANT.
I am taking for 2 reasons DEPRESSION and NERVE PAIN, works WONDERS ON the pain.
But made me nervous and 'weird' and wired on 30mg.  I cut back to 15mg and can manage.  May have caused Major pain in stomach, had to go to E.R. 2x in one month since beginning.  So that might be the cause, the verdict isn't in on that one.

Excellent on my severe back pain. 
This is a powerful drug so you must watch your mental state while on it, and cut back if you feel like 'not you.' others have said what I experience on higher doses, not like 'myself.' and that's not good.
I have to take early in the day or I have a hard time sleeping on this drug."

After a couple years on 60 mg once a day, my nuero said I have fibro. I was researching the reviews on Web MD last night and I figured out why my hair is falling out, why my feet and legs hurt until I'm in tears, why I a have been having angry outbursts, and forget.. the sex! Also, I have gained 50 pounds in 2 years. I took half of my pill (poured out the little balls) about 3 pm. Nine hours late on my pill and itching so bad. I am on my third glass of Merlot to control the symptoms. I am keeping a blog on myspace.com. Look me up and give me a shout out...my name is Tracy Sanders on myspace.com. I have never written a blog before, but this drug deserves one. I reviewed Cymbalta back in Dec. 2008 and it was my lifesaver, for a while. I do not think that I have fibro, I think it is a side affect of Cymbalta, who knows. I went in for my bloodwork last month and now my liver enzimes are out of whack and my cholesteral is so high that I am on lovastatin, now. Whee! I never had a problem with this. They did a ultrasound on my liver and gallbladder, a bonescan, osteoporosis now... my foot broke. Look me up. I am on myspace...Tracy Sanders. I would like some feedback.

Immediately, I experienced mild hallucinations, which at first were amusing as I realized I was ""seeing things"" not there.
After two days, the hallucinations got much worse and very, very scary. I lost touch with reality -- and replaced it with vivid nightmare images and horrid scenario that scared the crap out of me.

It stopped only after my wife and brother badgered the doctor to stop the cymbalta.

Nearly two years later I still have nightmares.

It did very little to help the depressive side of my Bipolar 2. It rapidly increased my weight, which no other medicine had ever done. I retained water, was constantly bloated and still miserably depressed.

But the worst part, which the Drug Companies never fully explain are the withdrawal symptoms.  Even while withdrawing slowly off this drug it took me 4 months to fully recover.  I became a manic, psychotic, depressed, non-functioning person.  Many people can never get off this drug. The risks far outweigh the benefits. Although there are some people who don't suffer from the withdrawal effect - it is not worth the risk....Try to avoid this drug for depression and particularly for pain. They are better drugs out there. I can't believe that the FDA certified it for certain types of pain. Its a truly terrible drug and the Drug Company that produces it knows it."

I had a 4th back surgery and continued chronic pain with that and fight fatique (MS related) with metadate and the cymbalta really helped boost the metadate.  But, the doc didn't mention any side effects, esp. that of weight gain, which is a BIG issue with me due to the back surgeries. I just can't carry extra weight. I gained 25 pounds in a very short amount of time and have fought tooth and nail to loose it.  Lost 1, gained 2. I feel like I'm in someone else's body. SO uncomfortable all the time on top of the discomfort and aches and pains I deal with all day and night. I saw the doctor again and talked at length about this weight and she never mentioned the cymbalta as a cause. But she did pop out her own weight plan and food journal.  Chalked the wt. gain up to a different drug I'm taking from a different doc.  I am SO p.o'd!!  Will be starting topamax tomorrow for migraines; my cymbalta has been decreased by a third; will also restart wellbutrin and looking forward to the side effect of weight loss from the topomax! I thought it was just me, but after reading so many other people's same issue, I'm glad to know but so disappointed (again) by the medical society.

I took a whole bottle of Xanax. I wanted to just go away. I wanted to leave my life. I thought that my family would be better off without me.  

My son and husband found me passed out on the floor and called an ambulance. I spent two weeks in the hospital. I worked with doctors to change my drugs, and I am now happy, healthy, and have a wonderful life.

My doctor stated to me after everything was fixed ""We were poisoning you with that drug"". 

I COMPLETELY agree with him. I am soo thankful to my Lord that he didn't take me home that day. 

Every time I hear someone mention this drug I cringe.  Yes it helped me for a year, but the process of trying to get off of it, almost killed me. 

I encourage anyone who is talking with their doctor about taking Cymbalta, to really look at things, look for alternatives, know FOR SURE that this is the medication for you.  Because it sure wasn't for me.

Hi there.
Over the past 10 years, I have taken: Prozac, Paxil (yikes!), Celexa, Lexapro, Zoloft, Effexor XR, Serzone, Trazodone, Elavil, and Pamelor.  In most cases, either the side effects were intolerable or there was something ""missing."" When I began treatment with Cymbalta, something clicked - and it felt wonderful.  Over the past couple of years, I've been on/off it due to insurance b.s.  A little over two months ago, I resumed taking Cymbalta 60mg/day.  My depression began to lift within two-three weeks, then after a month, my fibromyalgia symptoms decreased and my chronic back pain is GONE.
The only side effects I've noticed are: very mild decrease in libido (hence only 4/5 stars on ease of use), a bit of sweating, and occasionally a tad of urinary hesitation.  I'm guessing that Cymbalta has just the right balance of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. (unlike most other SNRIs)
Though it can be a bit pricey depending on your insurance, I believe it is well worth it. Honestly, I would recommend this medication to anyone- especially to those who have not responded to SSRIs and also those who suffer from the double-whammy of depression and a chronic pain syndrome.
Best of luck!"

I lost my short-term memory, had severely stiff muscles and cramping, increased depression, intolerable insomnia, sugar cravings like you wouldn't believe (with related weight gain), joint pain, heart palpitations, tinnitus, hypertension, no libido, no motivation to do anything.  They don't give you enough information on side effects.  I didn't know I was having side effects until I found this web site.  I spent a month weaning myself off and felt dramatically better - like I have my life back. I actually started sleeping a little.  After  a month I threw the rest of my pills away and have been having some withdrawal.  It takes a while to get this poison out of your system, I guess.  The joint pain and muscle cramping are worse.  I feel a lot of intense, irrational anger, still have heart palpitations, tinnitus and hypertension.  At least I can sleep.  I made the decision to get off this stuff without consulting my dr. My experience with drs. is that they want to increase the dosage or add another pill to combat side effects rather than support a patient becoming drug free.  If depression becomes a problem in the future, I'll try a more natural approach to treating  it.  Right now, despite the withdrawal symptoms, I feel pretty terrific - better than I have felt in years.

I finally decided to get off of it and it has been 3 nights that I do not get any sleep! I feel extremely dizzy and nauseated all day long. I have done some research on this drug's withdrawal symptoms and it seems to be a consensus that it is like living hell.

At fist, I thought this was a wonderful medicine. But over time, there was such a subtle change in my health. I gained weight and had more body aches, less energy, and muscle tension/aches. As my Doctor increased the dose, the side effects increased but my Doctor was sure my symptoms had nothing to do with Cymbalta. With the increased weight gain came high blood pressure (I am 47). And not long ago, I just was convinced that while the depression seemed under control, I felt like I was dying in every other way. Then I just could no longer financially afford this very expensive medicine, so I went off it. I stepped down the dose very carefully, but the withdrawal symptoms left me feeling horrible. Each morning I had tremendous aches in my feet & hands, then pinches of sharp pain all over & my peripheral vision seemed affected. It felt like my brain was having spasms.  I also had some headaches behind my eyes along with the other withdrawal symptoms. So I just stopped taking it all together. After a few months, I haven't felt this good in YEARS!  I am so glad this toxic drug is out of my system.  I don't feel the physical pain of depression, I have more energy & have begun to lose the weight! I am no longer running to my Doctor with so many complaints I felt I was dying! I would NOT recommend this drug to my worst enemy. Unless you want to slowly and subtly feel like you're dying in the process of handling depression, this drug is horrible. And who wants to gain weight?? Talk about depressing!!!  The withdrawal from Cymbalta is scary, I can't imagine what it was really doing to my brain.

2150$Major Depressive Disorder$7/12/2010 12:38:54 AM$Reviewer: Bonnie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$I started on this med after several months of being off antidepressants. I did a lot of research on it and decided it was worth a try. It took 5 or 6 weeks before I started feeling like myself again, but I'm so glad I picked this drug! Here's my story: after 6 or 7 years on Celexa (which I had a good experience with) something went wrong. I still don't know what it was exactly, but all of a sudden I was exhausted and had zero energy all the time. So I stopped the Celexa and was determined to stay off antidepressants and treat my depression naturally. Things were O.K. for a few months, but eventually my anxiety/panic attacks/depression/suicidal thoughts got so bad I could not sleep, eat, or enjoy anything and I felt ill-at-ease every waking moment. I cried easily and got angry and hostile over the smallest things. It didn't help that I was just out of school, unemployed, and living in a city with 15% unemployment. The only response I got from sending out dozens of resumes/applications was a from a grocery store...which I worked at unhappily for 5 months (the average time of employment for me). On a side note, I am certain I have Borderline Personality Disorder, though I have not been officially diagnosed. Anyway, if I hadn't gone on this drug when I did, I'm not sure what would've happened to me. I'm sure I scared my husband of less than two years with all my drama. For me, this drug was not effective right away; I spent the first couple of weeks on the couch unable to move unless I had to go to work, bed, or the bathroom. Now, three months later I am fully functional again. The only problems I face now are 1) this drug is VERY expensive and 2) I am trying to get pregnant and both my psych dr. and OB/GYN tell me I need to stop taking it before the 3rd trimester if I do get pregnant. I'm not sure what to do yet because I don't want to go through another horrible depressive state again. For now, things are good so I will count that as a blessing.

I understand it could take around a month to see the full effect, but Ive seen a big difference already. Since day 4, there have been no thoughts of suicide and no crying. Both have been multiple daily occurances for the past 7 months.
Major draw back. Also on day 4, major sexual disfunction started. Lower libido, difficulty gaining an erection, and nearly imposible to orgasm.
I guess the benefits outway the cons. Situational depression, so the hope is only 4 months or so to be on it, while I continue therapy."

In the beginning I was taking Prozac and Welbutrine and doing pretty well feeling ok. I told him I wanted to quit all mental type medications and then eventually get off all medications he agreed and suggest I start with weaning off prozac and welbutrine so I did. I felt some depression return so he prescribed Cymbalta. My 2 mistakes; First not researching the drug before starting it and trusting a doctor I did not know very well. Now since I am weaning off Cymbalta I am cursed to suffer 90% of all the bad side effects and there was never any benefit for me to take this drug and when I complained to my psychiatrist about it he just doubled the doseage. When my primary care Doctor found out he said that it was a very bad idea to take more then 60mgs. a day I was doing 120 by doctors orders, never again!

Within 1 week of starting Cymbalta, I was happier and more motivated. I began to get active and interested in doing stuff again. I lost 12 pounds in 2 months on cymbalta bc it cut my appetite and increased my energy. I am very tolerant of nausea and do not experience nausea easily, but this did cause slight nausea and a sense of fullness/disinterest in food altogether. I had to force myself to eat and my mouth was dry. After 6 months I am still on 60mg and have adjusted. I am no longer as disinterested in food and my mouth is not as dry. My hair is suffering a bit. I am already taking 2X RDA of Zinc and Selenium to help with hair loss for Wellbutrin. Dr. told me to up the dosage of Zinc & Selinium. I buy only brands I trust like Whole Foods and Nature's Way (NW). NW is made in Germany, where vitamins and herbs are regulated like the FDA does w/drugs in the US, so that dosages are consistent. My eyelashes got longer within 6 weeks of starting the Zinc & Selenium the first time, but with the introduction of more Wellbutrin and then Cymbalta, I think I need to take another dose every day. Currently I take them with my other pills in the mornign with breakfast. I have only good things to say about Cymbalta, despite the hair breakage. I have been on Lexapro, Effexor, Pamelor, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin. Cymbalta has had the most dramatic effect for relieving my depression (mood improved, irritability relieved, energy increased, motivation increased, anxiety almost gone. No sleep issues, no weight gain.) It's worth a try.

2222$Major Depressive Disorder$6/3/2010 3:52:41 PM$Reviewer: simplelife, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$2$1$I have been on Cymbalta for 5 yrs.  It will help with depression somewhat (as well as any other antidep) BUT the side effects far outweigh benefits.  The only reason I have taken so long is that it's extremely difficult to stop....Some other users ask if fast heartbeat, anxious, is normal with this med...that is actually a withdrawl symptom specific to Cymbalta. Problem is that it is so short acting that if you forget the dose or take it much later than the day before, these syptoms will start immediately.  So users think its a side effect. There are many bad effects when first taking....but when they go away, and your body becomes tolerant then med also slowly stops working....so after the first year you are really just taking med for no reason. Never heard anyone say it actually helps pain...I am transitioning to another med...not easy, but did realise that syptoms I had for so long are now going away, like sleepiness, uncaring, energy loss...and sex is now amazing...so MY advise is...only start this med if: the cost and doctor visits to get right dosage are not an issue, you are militant about taking meds on time, you are not in a relationship or care about sexual side effects, you don't require much energy or concentration throughout the day, and will be able to handle the pain if you ever have to stop taking med.

A year ago I was given Cymbalta for major depression. YIKES! I took 20 mg for 2 weeks; 40 mg for 3 weeks. Started having numbness/tingling in arms, head, legs. Even collapsed at work with major chest pain. Dr. wanted to INCREASE meds! I said, ""NO!"" and about ran out of her office. I've changed doctors since then.

To wean off this drug was a nightmare - missed two days of work and was a zombie. It's taken a year for the numbness to subside, but I still believe I have issues (major weakness) from taking this drug. 

Please read all warning labels for Cymbalta. There are many other choices that are much safer. I, for one, prefer the older drugs that have been time-tested, and proven.

If you do plan to wean off, do so VERY slowly, but persistently. If you're considering this drug, please reconsider!"

2272$Major Depressive Disorder$5/2/2010 8:02:57 PM$Reviewer: Bee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$4$This medication worked for about a year, but after that I found myself just as unmotivated and depressed again.  Also, just recently I discovered why I was sweating non-stop during the day, which was very unusual for me, and I blamed it on  perimenopause. My practioner and I decided to take me off Cymbalta which has been totally misrable! I weaned myself off very, very slowly, even down to opening the caps and only taking a few dots of the med.  It has been over a month now, and a 2 weeks since I completely stopped. I still get waves of dizziness with that gross light nausea.  I hate the drug!

2275$Major Depressive Disorder$4/29/2010 9:44:44 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$1$"This drug helped me feel happier and more stable for the first few months. Over time as my tolerance for the drug increased, my symptoms increased, and the dosage increased. I would feel better for a few months after an increased dosage. Eventually I was on the highest dosage but my symptoms were still getting worse. I felt like I was getting lower and more hopeless with each passing day. I ended up getting off the medication because of its lack of effectiveness and experienced intense withdrawal symptoms which included the following: migraines, insomnia, fever, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety attacks, and more.  I had a migraine every day for over 3 months after stopping this medication.  After about 4 months without the medication I began feeling better. Now it's been 6 months off the medication and my depression, sleepiness, and mental and physical energy is largely better than it was when I was on the medication.  I'm back to my normal depressed state which isn't great, but on the medication it was much worse. This medication truly made my depression worse and caused me to become suicidal.  I strongly suggest close monitoring of any young adult who takes this medication (as stated under Cymbalta's ""Warning""), and I also suggests tapering off the medication instead of quitting cold turkey.  Good luck everyone.  "

Cymbalta has been a life saver.  I hope my system doesn't get used to it and the effectiveness decreases.  It has greatly improved my whole outlook on life and I think it has helped my fibro pain; I'm taking Lyrica also, which is also a great help. I feel I have finally found relief.

Some worked for awhile and others not at all. When my doctor suggested cymbalta when one of the others had stopped working I thought, ""here we go again."" I was so surprised with the results, it has worked better than any antidepressant I have ever taken and I feel better than I have in my life. I have been taking cymbalta for over five years now and it is still doing the job.  I know everyone is different, I have a friend it caused him bad nausea, but I never had any problem.  I am so grateful for finally finding a medication that has worked good for as long as it has. Even if it stopped working tomorrow I would still recommend cymbalta for the past years that it did work.

Started taking Cymbalta for a sudden, major depressive episode.  It worked well at first, but soon the dry mouth and tremors became a problem.  It stopped working after a few months, so Wellbutrin was added.  My hair had also begun to fall out.  Weaned off the Cymbalta for that reason, which caused severe vertigo for several weeks, but eventually the side effects stopped.  I lost about half my hair, which hasn't really started growing back yet after 6 months.  That has been the most traumatic, and certainly didn't help with the depression.  I never would have taken Cymbalta had I known that was a documented side effect.  I'm now doing well on Wellbutrin extended release.  I've tried many antidepressants over the years and it is a trial and error process, but I would be wary of Cymbalta.

It wasn't outside on the skin ,it felt more like inside my skin. I know, weird, but I couldn't see anything on my skin. I research it and itching was one of the side effects, although it was way down the list. My doctor said to discontinue and see what happened. ALL itching stopped within several days. I really hated to stop, it made me feel a lot better in stressfull situations.

I also have severe anxiety and also take .5 MG of Ativan when needed. This combination has been the best for me and I can finally sit down and watch a movie with my 2 adorable boys or go outside and play with them. I have tried so many other drugs and the Cymbalta and Ativan are what worked for me after about 15 different combinations. I know that people are scared of the addiction to benzos but I see it this way: I have to take the Cymbalta everyday so how is that any different than addiction? I do watch my in take of Ativan and only use it when I need it.

It took me a long time to realize that I actually had depression because I had more of the physical symptoms than the emotional symptoms. After seeing several doctors trying to figure out what was wrong with me I finally found one doctor that told me ""it might be depression"".  The first week on cymbalta was horrible -- fatigue, dry mouth, constipation and numbness.  After the first 6 weeks i felt great and stuck to it for one year. However I had a lot of bad side effects -- I gained 15lbs, my hair shed on and off, my abdomen swelled to the point where people thought i was pregnant and lastly was the acne (which I never had in my life).  However, I remained on the treatment for one year and have recently weaned off(with doctors supervision).  This process was very difficult.  I had diarehhea, brain zaps and insomnia for 10 days straight. I weaned off in about 1 month.  Now after my first episode of depression a year ago I feel great.  I feel like my old self again. The side effects were horrible but well worth it. I would recommend this drug. It changed my life.  "

I don't believe this is such a great treatment, I was at 120mg quickly. I only saw good effects at each increase for about a month. There are other meds out there that can be used together and not cause such adverse side effects when one wants to come off cymbalta.  I feel the public needs to be made aware of the total concept that comes when one chooses to starts this med.  I am not happy with the total results at 102mgs, and I started at 30mgs. I have had other drugs added and stopped to make this drug work up to the potential it claims.  NO WHERE did I read of ""Brain Zaps"" as a possible reaction in all the literature I read previous to starting or wanting to STOP taking this drug. Only after searching the web did I discover what I was in for in STOPPING. FDA needs to get a much better handle on the true public info put out by the drug comnpanies which claim this is a ""Safe drug"".  Safe for the growth of their own pockets only.  I know of noone who has had great results or few effects especially when withdrawing from this med.  Just search the wed on cymbalta withdrawl and you'll find what I'm saying. I have been on Cymabalta for over 2+yrs. I would of come off this a year ago, but my Psych said ""no"". In order to get off I have had to research on my own and make contacts with other doctors and pharmacist. This is the worst time I have ever had coming off of any med, or alcohol bing or 1960-70's drugs(which I didn't indulge in a lot) SAD ;("

Switching was a disaster!  Cymbalta is the best medication I have used.  It controls the pain of fibromyalgia very well and the depression is relieved to a manageable degree.  I take several other medications for bipolar, seroquel and topamax, and dexadrine so I can stay awake and alert during the day, and buspar for nighttime teeth grinding.  It's a lot of meds, but I'm surviving.  I live in the Pacific Northwest right now and the constant rain and dreary weather do not help, but we are moving and hopefully, the depression will improve with more sunshine.  I highly suggest Cymbalta.  I know different meds work for different people, but this one is worth a try.  I've used almost everyone out there and this is one of the best by far.  I've been medicated for since I was 12 and that's been 25 years now.  No novice here!  =)  Good luck with relief for your pain and depression.  God bless!

At first, I got more energy, but now I am still extremly lethargic! I am soooooo tired, this is a possiblity a cause of my arthritis, but I am still unsure. If I miss a dose by 1 day, the wd's or ""side effects"" or whatever you want to call them are way worse than the Zoloft. I start feeling ""loopy"" kinda like I am not really here - Like an outer body experience. As far as the ""brain zaps"" people are writing about, I have experienced them. I seem to loose concentration and get alot of muscle cramps and joint pain and get excessivly tired-----even more than I am on a daily basis. It takes atleast 2 full days of taking the Cymbalta again if I miss 1 day to get back to ""normal"" ways of feeling. It is the more expensive ""co-pay"" on my insurance as well, so that is not the best. "

2519$Major Depressive Disorder$12/29/2009 1:31:18 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$5$There is good and bad with any drug. Cymbalta def helped with body aches due to depression. Never got any suicidal thoughts like with other meds. I have gained sufficient weight, acne breakouts, some stomach aches, night sweats, migraines with vomiting, and insomnia.  It's all about what the trade off is for you. I thought it was effective, but now I have no insurance so I have no choice but to discontinue use. I'm very scared of the withdrawl.  I'm quite used to the brain zaps, but I've heard it gets worse.  I would like to find an all natural way of fighting depression.

I can tell it has worked better than Paxil but am not feeling any big changes. How long does the med. really take effect? I have anxiety already so I'm not very patient, but I still am depressed, paranoid, don't want to do anything and I just feel like everyone hates me. I saw a Pschologist for over 3 months and she was completely worthless. I'm so tired of feeling this way.  I read such good results with this, can anyone give me a idea how long I have to wait to feel better?

Cymbalta is a first choice of my doctor when the patient fits the criteria. I did and it works wonderful. I am able to stay at 60mg once a day. At one point after a death in my family my doctor uped my dosage to 90mg once daily. The side affect I expierenced with the 90mg is excessive 'sweating' not pleasent. she reduced my dosage back to 60mg and all is well. No side affects and I feel great mentally.

It improved my mood, and gave me a general positive feeling.  HOWEVER - I tend to build up immunities to drugs, etc, and I basically back to my old self - suicidal thoughts, boughts with deep depression, etc etc etc.  I hope to be upped in dosage to 120mg or put on something completely different.  I've also gained quite a bit of weight - but that is related to my overeating complex too.  As far as side effects - nothing that I can tell.  The withdrawals are horrible though.  If I am off the drug for at least a day and half, I start to feel dizziness, I have concentration issues, and feel the brain zaps.  I highly recommend weening yourself if you come of this drug, as the seratonine withdrawals are awful.

This is the 3rd drug I've been on.  It has been quite effective for me.  My side effects have have been very dry mouth, constipation, and very seldom dizziness.  As to ""Brain zaps"" they are hard to describe, if you have had them you just know, they are kind of like ""fire works"" in your head it's like ""tsssh""  over and over again in your head.  Similar to the sound of a cymbal.  Another thing is  I had lost 80 pounds prior to starting Cymbalta,  I have kept it all off while on Cymbalta for 4 years.  I'd hoped to lose more but at least I haven't gained.  I now seem to have more trouble with OCD,  so I am about to go off Cymbalta and try Luvox cr.

As a teenager I had been on nearly every medication, but Effexor worked best. My Dr. prescribed Cymbalta due to 'fewer withdrawal symptoms'. It made a huge difference at first with little to no side effects. I recently increased my dose to 160 due to a lack of interest and increased anxiety. So far, no terrible side effects, and it seems to be working! I feel very lucky to have finally found a drug that can help me.

It wasn't very effective in helping my depression compared to other medications I've used. Not only that but it was expensive and I've never experienced such bad side effects on anything else. Overall I was not happy with it, it just didn't work for me.
2575$Major Depressive Disorder$12/5/2009 1:44:56 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$"I have been going through severe depression for years now and have been prescribed just about every anti-depressant out there. Most have no effect on me at all. Cymbalta, however, made me feel impulsively suicidal (not the usual ""maybe everything would be better if I wasn't here"" thoughts those of us with severe depression have, but very scary and almost uncontrollable impulses to harm myself were prominent). Cymbalta also made me more emotional and my already frequent, uncontrollable crying spells only increased and became more severe. This drug must work for some people if it's out there but my personal experience was absolutely awful and I would not recommend Cymbalta to anyone who does not have the benefit of constant contact and/or is living with supportive people who understand your condition, because if your experience is anything like mine you'll feel too low to even go back to the doctor to get help."

I started out at just 30mg but now am all the way at 120mg.  If I am late taking this drug by 2 hours the horrible side effects begin.  If I miss it entirely I know it will be 24-48 hours before I feel okay again.  Some have asked what Brain Zaps are..... I describe them as kind of like an electric shock/dizziness and blankness all at once.  I have insomnia now as well and have gained 25 pounds.  I am very fearful of coming off of them so that my husband and I can have another child.  It has completely taken away my anxiety and the severe bouts with depression and suicidal ideations.  I still, however have never regained any intrest in doing anything.  I haven't tried therapy and have put all my hopes into medication, which is lazy, I know.  I don't believe I would recommend this medication to anyone unless you'd tried several others first.

When I was first diagnosed as a child I was put on paxil and it helped but later in life was switched to Cymbalta because of sexual side effects with paxil. Cymbalta worked great for my panic attacks, it gave me energy I felt great, I didn't have the constant overwhelming anxiety over my head and it was amazing... until the effects started wearing off. After about a year it felt like the Cymbalta was sucking energy from me instead of giving it to me, I was tired physically and mentally, I started getting bran zaps, sometimes slurred speech, confusion or brain fog, and I could feel the anxiety slowly creeping back in the picture. So my doctor switched me over to Prozac however getting off of Cymbalta is no easy task! You experience horrible withdrawal symptoms such as: horrible physical pain and weakness, brain fog, uncontrollable muscle tremors, extreme nausea, feelings of being lost or out of place, intense periods of depression and crying, heart palpitations, dizziness, extreme anger, migraines, and the list goes on. To say the least, it's no cake walk and you probably will slip and take one just for a break in the withdrawal symptoms but be strong and stay at it and the symptoms will slowly subside. I finally stopped having withdrawal symptoms about 2 months after stopping Cymbalta. I implore anyone researching Cymbalta to try Prozac first; I've been on it for about a year and a half now and couldn't be happier. I hope this helps! Always remember you're not alone in this and stay positive. Never give up hope, life is beautiful behind the veil of depression and anxiety. Tomorrow the sun will rise and bring with it a new day with many new possibilities :) God bless!

My doctor started me off with 30 for about 6 weeks and then i started the 60. I can really say i am such a different person now then i was six months ago. All i can say is all antideprassants will react differently to different people and its just a matter of finding one that works for you!

To everyone who's posted on here about being in withdrawal from it, hang in there!! The symptoms with go away completely within a couple of months. One other major complaint I have about this stuff is it totally sucked away my motivation to exercise. Before I started taking it I was working out and running on a semi-regular basis and after a few weeks on cymbalta I had stopped entirely. I think the anti-anxiety part of it sort of sucks away your excess energy. Which I guess sort of makes sense because while I was on it I didn't get enraged over stupid things like I do sometimes before and after I was on it. All in all I think a decent diet, some exercise and trying to keep  yourself busy with things you enjoy doing is a better solution than cymbalta. If I ever feel like I need to go back on anti-depressants I think I'll try something that is a little more well tested and documented.

During that period I experienced everything from the excessive sweating, and vivid nightmares, to debilitating migranes (complete with vomitting) and tremors. On a brighter note, I resumed talking, but crying everyday for hours on end, insomnia and the overwhelming sadness remained. I've since tried Depakote and amitriptiline, and I feel much better today than when I was first put on medication. The sadness is still there but no longer hovers over me 24/7 - its more like distracting background noise that can be drowned out on occasion.

My doctor recommended cymbalta for me when lexapro wasnt cutting it, because I also have chronic pain, and cymbalta has been shown to help in patients with depression and  neuropathic pain. Only 4 days into taking cymbalta I had a major breakdown with severe suicidal thoughts I hadn't had in years. I've heard many success stories, so I just say- use caution- and make sure you have a support system- someone you can go to if this does happen to you, and stay in close contact with your doc.

I had been on Lexapro for a couple years and got somewhat better but then my depression got very bad again.  I switched to Cymbalta and after ab 6 months I felt like a normal person again.  Hardly any side effects at all, except maybe some sexual side effects but that's nothing compared to my depression.  After 2 years I stopped taking it without tapering (dr didn't say to).  It was very easy for me to get off of, and I didn't experience any withdrawal plus my depression didn't come back.  Remember though that for antidepressants you don't know how each one will work for you until you try it as they affect each person differently.  Good luck!

My doctor said to cut the 60 mg. to 30 for a week, then go 30 mg every other day for a week.  Bad idea!  I am tapering it off over 4 weeks more by opening the capsules and reducing by 1/4 each week.

it is another miracle drug. I have taken cymbalta for about 3 years and feel great.

Then I began to have night sweats, started getting shaking, & headaches.

Also began having uncontrolled crying fits and screaming at my boyfriend for no reason at all. No memory of these occurances. Began walking around in my sleep and moving things around my house. Decided to take myself off the med by going back down to 30mgs for 2 weeks & then stopping completely. Was the worst withdrawal symptoms of my life.

I went through a few days where I was unable to get my refill and experienced dizziness, diahrrea, and extreme nausea! This is one drug you should definitely consult your physician before attempting to stop taking it! Too bad there is no generic, yet, though.

I am needing to either raise the dose again or switch to another medication as I am having depression (major) issues again. As far as the helping with pain- I have found it does not help me what so ever. This medication helped with my depression when I first started on it and slowly my depression is at full force again. YIKES!!! Good luck and hope it helps you.

My doseage was moved up to 60mg and my goodness the nausea was just unbareable. This medicine does work but not for me. If you do have a higher dosage i suggest to eat a huge breakfast while taking this medication and take the medication while eating to not get side effect of nausea.

I took 60mg for 9 months and deciede to come off of it to see if I could feel normal again without meds and also because it was very expensive.  No one tells you about the horrible withdrawal symptoms...headaches, brain zaps, mood swings, crying spells, intense dreams.  This is the worst thing that I have ever been through.  I havae been off of it completely for 1 week today and my sysmptoms are jsuto starting to get a little better.  I did taper off of it, but no matter how long your taper schedule is, you will still have withdrawals!!

Ive been on every antidepressant in existance over the past 10 years. Nothing ever worked and I just walked around like a zombie with no care for my life at all.
Cymbalta has woken me up and I can go outside and smile and drive and am so happy. My 2 children and the rest of my family are amazed.
I can't make it without Cymbalta and now...
I tried to refill my Cymbalta on 8/17/09 because I only had enough to get me through 8/18/09. Walmart and Sams insurance no longer pays for Cymbalta and I had all of one day notice before I ran out of medication. It will cost over $450 to refill. I don't even have $100 in my bank account. I am sooooooooo upset and terrified. Everywhere I call gets no help. I am now out of pills and wont be able to take my morning dose.
I called my doctor 3x on Monday, 8/17/09 and the receptionist called her and I was told that they had no samples.
My next question is ""ok, and?"" I really don't understand. I have read post after post from people going through hell as they get off cymbalta and they had pills to take lower dosages as the days went by. I have NOTHING. God gave me my life back and I am so hurt that I am losing it. I don't want to be the way I used to be. I never left my bedroom and I didnt even check the mail. As of the last month, I am rarely in my room except to sleep and I spend lots of time with my family. My kids deserve to have a real mom for once and they will be hurt by this just as much as it is going to hurt me.
I don't know what to do :(
Please someone help me.

2833$Major Depressive Disorder$8/17/2009 11:46:39 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$3$5$You know when I started taking this medication when it first came out in 2004 I thought it was amazing. I thought I felt better and I thought I was dealing with life better. Now that I dumped all my pills down the toilet, because, I couldn't afford them and I was tired of being dependent on a pill, I feel so much better. On Cymbalta or any of the other depression pills I have been on I never really felt better. I thought I was better because the Doctors always told me, this will make you feel better. I have been on depression medication since I was 16 years old and I am now 28 (I couldn't remember what it was like to not be on a pill). Now that I am off my medication my suicidal thoughts have almost depleted. I don't feel so tired all the time and my IBS is going away. Not to say that depression medication does not help people, but, I can honestly say that I feel 10 times better being off of it than I did on it. I hope this helps someone.

I looked it up online and decided that it would be safe enough, hassle-free enough, and so I asked my doctor for a prescription.

After about two months, I noticed that I was getting small lumps under my skin -- about a dozen of them -- that seemed to be growing kind of fast.  I didn't associate it with Cymbalta, they didn't actually hurt, and I had a follow-up appointment with my doctor in about a month, so I didn't do anything.

Then, we discovered a lump in my breast, on my chest wall and immovable.  Needless to say, I went to the doctor right away.   He said he didn't know the cause of any of the bumps, but got me a referral to a surgeon right away for the one in my breast.  

I had the lump removed -- went through the risk of surgery with general anesthesia.  The cytology showed that the lump was not cancer, but a lipoma -- a cyst of fat.

I looked up every one of my meds online, read every single possible problem with them.  Lo and behold one of the things Cymbalta could do was cause lipomas.  I  took myself off of it, tapered off.

That was all about 4 years ago.   I still have the other lumps, though they might be marginally smaller. "

I tried a lot of different meds for my depression, and this is the only thing that seemed to do anything for me (without horrible side effects).  The only real negative has been that a couple of times I didn't get it refilled in time, and having to go even 1 day without it is VERY difficult.  I am now tapering down off of the Cymbalta to try Prozac, and I feel like I am going through really bad withdrawal.  I am really light headed, and feel faint and dizzy... it sucks!  I'm hoping it will pass as my body adjusts.  But this medication is definitely worth a try for anyone who is severely depressed.

Initially, it worked pretty well. However, over time it was just like the Effexor. I had gone off Effexor in the past and suffered only minor feelings of restlessness, anxiety, sweating and some nausea. Not so with Cymbalta. I ran out, and within 4 days of having weaned myself off (I went from 120 mg to 60 to 0), began feeling such despair and hopelessness. I was sweating profusely, felt disoriented - like I didn't belong anywhere, crying, my entire body began to spasm. I vomited (severe, wretched) for 3 days. I couldn't even keep water down. I became dehydrated. I was shaking and shivering so hard my teeth rattled. I now have an idea what a junkie must feel like when detoxing from Heroin. I felt like a complete zombie. I have never felt so horrible in all my life. Whatever you do, DO NOT stop using Cymbalta unless you're in the hospital or have a health care professional in your home. I went back on Cymbalta as soon as I found someone to go to the pharmacy. There was no alternative. It would appear that I'll be taking this medication for the rest of my life. I can't go through the withdrawals agan. No way. I lost 2 weeks of my life. I don't know what it's the pharmacological make-up of this drug is. How can it cause such horrific symptoms when your body is deproved of it when it really doesn't work all that great?

I can't seem to find that happy place where i exist with my partner mentally and sexually.  I have spoken with the doctor and with no actions on his part i have been troubled with this fear and deep depression and lack of sexual satisfaction.  although cymbalta works at 120mg daily medicare has decided that it doesn't thus only 60mg daily is taken and im given restiril 30mg.  again totally not working.  the depression is ever still present and issues that i have no control over, physically or mentally not coping with either issue.  so does cymbalta work? yes but creates more issues that a bipolar person shouldn't have to deal with on a daily basis.

Swelling in my colon so bad I couldn't sit up. Was in bed exhausted. thought I was going to die from dehydration or liver problems.

Pamelor, Celexa, Zoloft, Buspar, Paxil never gave me this much trouble. Recommend getting a liver panel first and be wary if you have liver, stomach, or intestinal problems. Was on it three months.

I went from 60 to 30 to 20 milligrams and this past week have been opening up the capsule and counting the micro size beads inside.  i heard horror stories of weaning off this drug.  i have weaning off for 3 weeks now and hasnt been too bad.  i would recommend this drug but not for more than 6 months.  its way too strong. 
2942$Major Depressive Disorder$7/13/2009 5:01:12 PM$Reviewer: carbon740, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month$5$1$5$My wife took it for a week. I took her off of it because she said that she didn't care if the house caught on fire and took her and our two babies with it. She was crying the whole time she was on it. AND my cousin recently ate her whole bottle and was in a coma for three days. They say she should make a full recovery though. This drug is to dangerous for a doctor to send home with his patient without a proper study done, kinda like all the crap I had to go through for a CPAP machine. Good luck to the next victim, and remember it may just be the voices in you head. It was the scariest thing I ever seen. I've heard other stories also and they were'nt good.

As for the depression it actually did work. I felt much better emotionally, but physically it was terrible. I took Benadryl and it did help, but would last about four hours then I would have to take another 25 mg. It eventually caught up with me and I crashed for about three hours. My doc took me off it and now I am trying Severall.

I have had no negative side effects from it, and it seems to be working fairly well.  Antidepressants can have very different effects on different people, but for me, this medication has helped more than most others.  I have taken Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Effexor, Trazodone, and many mood stabilizers that have had either no effect or negative effects.  Cymbalta has been a fairly positive help for my depression, and has given me no negative side effects.  I am taking several other medications along with Cymbalta, and am doing much better than I was before I began taking it.

Caused me to gain 40 pounds though! Which was alarming to my primary health care physician. Its expecially depressing when they start in on you for NOT exercising or eating the wrong things when it doesn't seem like you changed anything.  I had to ask my Med Mgt Dr to take me off of it after 2 years.
2992$Major Depressive Disorder$6/29/2009 12:41:27 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$1$"I don't even know where to start! I've been on a variety of different anti-depressants over the years, but Cymbalta has been, by far, the least effective. Not only did I start having very disturbing dreams and restless sleep, but I didn't see any improvement in my mood. I felt more hopeless than ever before. 

One thing that I want anyone considering Cymbalta to know is that the Discontinuation Syndrome for this drug is horrendous. I'm slowly tapering off of Cymbalta right now and it's been the worst experience of my life. I feel like my body is shutting down. I've been incredibly nauseous, irritable, and generally out of sorts. I feel foggy and confused and I don't know what to do about it! I wish my psychiatrist would have told me about this when I started taking Cymbalta. 

Really weigh the pros and cons when considering Cymbalta as an option. Even if this drug does work for your depression (or other needs), if you don't plan on being on it forever, think about the discontinuation side effects because, personally and without being too dramatic, they are destroying my ability to function right now."

Yeah, right.)Constipation (for which I take Miralax), no energy, infrequent bouts with suicidal ideation, and feeling dull and uninterested in life are other side effects.  (In other words, the side effects are like the symptoms of depression I had in the first place!)I haven't tried to withdraw from it yet, but am thinking of going to a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner I know to pick his brain about other options before I do that.By the way, has anyone out there tried a new, natural anti-d called ""Serelax""?  I've read good things about it, but the reviewers say it's only good for mild to moderate depression.I'm assuming, therefore, that those of us with Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent won't really benefit from it.

This works for me. No weight gain, happy spirit.  If i get depressed- it is not the meds it is me, i have learned to work through it and to add jsut a little additional for anxity attacks which arenew now.  I do not want to start another med. too much for your body to go through to get use to.  This is the one for me.  Meds to do cause a death, the severness of the depression does and the sadness that no one can see or no once can cry loud enough for help to come.  I have been there.  That is why all medication has to be monitored- you just cannot take it and run free.

I've been on medication for my depression for over 6 years. I've pretty much been on all the major anti depressants- they either didn't work or I built up a tolerance to them. 

I'm at the highest dose possible- 3 of the blue and white pills a day but it still left me drowsy all the time (hence (-) one star for effectiveness) so my docter put me on Provigil too. Those two combined changed my life.

My Dr. suggested Cymbalta and I started on 30mg a day and now am currently taking 60mg a day. I am normally not depressed anymore but am not a zombie by any means. I don't get anxious like I used to. I also believe this drug helps with my diabetic nerve pain. I have gained weight taking this drug, which hasn't helped with my diabetic condition. I have also experienced horrific side effects from running out of this medication. I had nightmares, insomnia, terrible bouts of nausea, dizziness and I would wake up at night hearing my heart beating. I was terrified I was going to have a heart attack. When I got my meds again, I was okay. I have been taking this for almost two years and it scares me to think of running out. I really do believe I am addicted to it and I don't like that feeling. I hate taking medication but I was so depressed at the time, I welcomed any help. My Dr. seems to think I will be taking Cymbalta for a very long time.

I had had panic attacks in the past, and started again with the first few doses of Cymbalta.  I kept thinking it would get better, but instead got worse, much worse.  I was also getting the brain ""zaps"", horrible insomnia, weight gain, and oddly enough, urine output was diminished.  I found I could barely function, was a hazard on the road, etc., etc.  Went back to the doc, who told me to stop, get back on Lexapro 10 mg q day, and let him know.  For about 4-5 days after stopping the meds, I was totally debilitated; couldn't think, was dizzy, having sweats, nausea, and a host of other problems.  Called him back and he told me to open the capsule and take just a few grains from the Cymbalta for a few days, or however long it would take to feel ""normal"" again.  I do feel better after even the first time doing that.  I certainly hope this works, as I'm truly tired of messing around with pills and would love to have my life back. I have always worked for physicians, so have some idea of what is going on, which is not to say I'm not sick and tired of all the turmoil."

There are some real horror stories on here.  I had a great Dr. managing my meds...I was very concerned about withdrawal side effects, so we took over 3 months to get me off it after I was ""done"" (I was on it for 1 yr after it had started working to make sure I did not relapse after coming off).  Don't rush!  If you rush, you get bad side effects.  I started at 60mg and went down 10mg every 2 weeks.  Near the end she had me open the 20mg capsule, dump about half the contents out and reclose capsule and take it.  Then I took about 1/4 capsule.  Then I went to 1/4 capsule every other day.  I started to get bad vertigo at one point, so she had me step back to last dosage and start to decrease again once no side effects were there.  She also warned me that during withdrawal you can get what appears to be depression symptoms back (e.g. moodiness, lack of patience, crying for no reason, etc).  I'm glad she did - otherwise I might have thought I needed to go back on it vs. it being a temporary thing while getting off the meds.  It took over 3 months, but the process was a smooth one and I feel terrific.  Also - remember that people tend to read and write reviews on meds when they're experience isn't that great.  Most of these reviews sound terrible - but they are not a balanced view of what the med can do for you.  Most of the people with no problems won't have a reason to take the time to come on here.  Be patient with it!  If you have lots of withdrawal side effects, talk to your Doc and slow the process down.  There's no reason you have to feel terrible through it all.  Cymbalta gave me my life back.  I am a better wife, mother and friend after being on it.  I would do it all over again if I had to."

For me there were not really any side effects since I stopped being a smoker 3 mos before starting this med. Smoking from what I've experienced with other Anti-Ds can make side effects worse and then eventually they go away. But for short I did alright on this dose 20 mg. then the DR. raised it up to 60 mg. I felt ok not 100% better. still had some low-self esteem,little anxiety. Then after 3 mos it made me feel agitated, anxious, and feeling like everybody is the f-ing devil. Dr lowers it to 30 mg because I asked that it be lowered to see how that does. As a result, I still feel all the depression symptoms. Can't a f=-ing anti-depressant ever work!!! I am constantly changing my meds because after several mos they just don't work. I don't know what it is that I need. When I skip a day or 2. I feel GOOD! less stressed,worried and anxious. What the hell gives? Somebody told me in my group therapy that I may be getting too much of norepenephrine.HUH? Can a doctor tell me what and why these meds don't do thier jobs? I am stressed about these meds.!! I'm afraid of trying another one. I wish my dr. or someone could tell me what would be right for me.

I have been taking it for 2 months and I saw an improvement right away and it just keeps getting better. The only major side effect for me is the insomnia I experience every night. I only seem to get 3-4 hours of sleep a night. My doctor warned me about this and gave me some samples of Lunesta that work really well.  I will be taking that from now on before bed. Do not take Cymbalta before bed! It puts you in a 1/2 sleep 1/2 wake state with awful nightmares! Take first thing in the morning to avoid the dreaded dreams. Also, I do wake up damp from sweating but it isn't a real issue for me compared to what I was going through before. Hope this helps!!

Two and one half years ago I was injured at work. I had been off of work for about six months and was feeling very down, crying all of the time, very anxious about not being able to return to my work as a RN. My doctor put me on 30mg of Cymbalta once a day. I took it for a month, but really felt no effects until it was raised to 60mg once a day. It was like night and day for me. I felt so much better about myself and I wasn't crying all of the time. Instead of dwelling on what I couldn't do, I concentrated on what I could. I went back to school online while I was still unable to work and got my BBA with a concentration in healthcare. I am now working at a new job as a RN in a new youth mental health facitlity and working at getting my MBA. The only side effects that really bother me is the excessive sweating night and day and the weight gain. I can deal with those side effects because my outlook on life is so much better.

I am on 60mg a day. I experience anxiety, tremors, sleeplessness, talk very fast, I feel like a hamster in a wheel, I don't dream at all, therefore I don't think I am sleeping. I lost 9lbs in 3 days, no appetite, but I no longer have feelings of suicide. I am also a nurse. Don't feel like you are alone in depression. It is not descriminatory by any means.

I basically became unable to care for myself, i lost all ability to act with reason.  I do not believe i have ever been more terrified in my life.  My family called my doctor and removed cymbalta from ny medications.  I continued to have problems for about a week after stopping cymbalta.  I was not warned of possible side effects and had received samples.  The liturature with the medicine was quite vague and did not detail the possibility of such serious side effects.
3188$Major Depressive Disorder$4/18/2009 5:34:04 PM$Reviewer: Mitchy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have only been using Cymbalta for about 2 weeks.  I was previously taking Lexapro, which worked pretty well but I had still no energy or will to do anything.  My doctor weaned me off Lexapro for 5 days.  He did this by having me take 1/2 the dosage of Lexapro and 1/2 the dosage of Cymbalta that he wanted me to ultimately take.  It worked perfectly.  I now take 60 mg Cymbalta and no Lexapro (used to take 20mg) and I am feeling so much better already.  It is amazing!  I now have more energy and feel more positive.  The only problem that I do have is that it has made my insomnia worse.  I will discuss this with my doctor when I see him in 2 weeks.  I have various conditions including depression such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, mitral valve prolapse, hypothyroidism , generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia.  I am hopeful that Cymbalta will  continue to help these conditions improve.  Thank you so much!

I am able to be more patient with my son and in my workplace ( an emergency room).  I do notice if I miss a dose or take a dose late I feel ""funny"" and immediatley realize that I have not taken my med.  I hope not to be on this forever but for now it keeps me sane and focused on what is important which I had seemed to drift from before I started taking Cymbalta.

I have a fake disc that failed a buldging dics and L3 is almost bone on bone along with 3 bone disorders. Of course being in so much pain all the time and I've had 3 back surgery's with no luck and I'm only 30. Because of all this I have got major depression which sucks cause I have 4 kids as well and I have to try to stay positive around them even with all my back problems. I have tryed many anti-depresents Zolft, Lexapro ect.. I started Cymbalta 30 mg twice a day and that really didn't seem to do it and I didn't have any real side effects. After a month I was switched to 60 mg twice a day and I must say I am very impressed. It does actually work for nerve pain and major depression "" More Depression then nerve pain though"" and still has very little side effects like you have with alot of other depression medications. If Cymbalta doesn't seem to be working for you talk to your doctor about increasing the dose. He will know best considering your condition. Good Luck and don't give up hope!! Fighting depression can be hard but there are people out there who care. Just sometimes they can be hard to find. don't give up hope!!"

However, I stuck it out, now about 8 months, and I am so thankful for being perscribed this. I'll admit, this doctor sucked as a psychiatrist--perhaps she just knew that nothing she could say would help me--but her somewhat-risky suggestion to start taking 60mg Cymbalta at (almost) 17. It is definitly worth the mild constipation and increased sweating (only at night in my sleep). "

Although I'm menopausal, it's difficult to separate the two sometimes. So far, no side effects.  For those first timers, give it a couple of weeks to work.  Don't skip dosages. Don't change anything without discussing it with your physician.

It has been a week shy of a month starting it again and now Im having symptoms of Hepatitis.I also read on the Fibromyaglia page at Web Md (I have fibromyalgia)that you should not take cymbalta if you have bi-polar.

I am very happy with the results. I have tried many anti-depressants and find this very effective. My only complaints are that I feel nauseous most of the day, have irritable bowel syndrome, and extreme dry mouth. Those are symptoms I am willing to live with considering the alternative. I switched to Cymbalta from Effexor XR. The Effexor caused me to be tired ALL THE TIME, gain tons of weight, and still have aggression issues. So far no real complaints with the Cymbalta.

Therefore, its hard to say what each one does for me, other than I'm still quite depressed and have grand bouts of anxiety.  Some of it is situation-related, but hardly all.  I've been on Cymbalta for three years, and don't think it's done me any good.  But refer to my comment above.  You know...how do we know how well we are doing on a med until we go off of it, other than the fact I'm still quite sad.  It's like wondering if the lightbulb in the refrigerator is still on when it's door is shut.

Once I was finally adjusted to it (about 1 month), I felt pretty good overall.  However, it is extremely expensive and my insurance company requires prior approval (nuissance and timely with my doctor)--so I have decided to go off it after taking it for 15 months.  I stopped taking it approx. 1 week ago and am having awful withdrawl symptoms--dizziness, foggy-feeling, brain zaps, vertigo, heart palpitations, and an overall lousy feeling throughout my body which is worse in the afternoon and early evening.  I am also extremely prone to major mood swings--I was ready to punch something or someone this morning.  Not a good feeling...I don't want to feel like this anymore.  Please be advised that this medication has strong side effects and this is not often told to patients when beginning to take the drug.  Be careful!"
3307$Major Depressive Disorder$3/9/2009 3:59:16 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$This was the second antidepressant I tried, following a traumatic divorce and major life changes that left me terribly depressed for the first time in my life. Although I had never suffered from depression before I found myself severly depressed, having trouble concentrating, no interest in my children, my family, or my job. I had no side effects with Cymbalta and noticed a big difference in the first two weeks and within a month, I felt great. I lost a lot of weight prior to starting Cymbalta and have started to gain, maybe more than I would like! I have noticed that I feel hungry all the time. Sex drive is minimal but that is a small price to pay for the difference in how I feel otherwise.

3317$Major Depressive Disorder$3/4/2009 10:34:45 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$"I started taking Cymbalta due to depression, anxiety and panic attacks. At first I didn't get any sleep for about 3 days. I began to then have muscle spasms and could never feel relaxed. It started working on the depression and anxiety but I began to feel a bit paranoid. After taking the medication for 2 ½ months the depression and anxiety came back time ten. I immediately stopped taking it, NOT RECOMMENDED, and haven’t touched the stuff since. I don't think it was right for me but it could be good for others.

Do not stop taking a medication cold turkey either, it could be more harmful to you.

3341$Major Depressive Disorder$2/25/2009 4:31:40 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I think this medication has done a pretty good job on my depression symptoms so I can actually get up and function, but it hasn't been able to totally suppress the anxiety and ruminating/obsessive thoughts that have accompanied my condition.  I take 60mg once a day in the morning and I have just been given an add-on of BuSpar 10mg 2x daily to see if that can help relieve some of the anxiety I still get.  I've heard Cymbalta works well with BuSpar...but I guess I'll find out.  As far as side-effects go, I haven't noticed much of anything aside from a slight decrease in appetite and some mild constipation at first, but I have since adjusted to the medicine and that has gone away.  I'm not so sure if Cymbalta's claims for anxiety relief are too accurate, but it is effective on major depression.

I started taking it at night and had a huge amount of energy and couldn't sleep at night. Then in the mornings I was super tierd. I'm switching it today and going to take it in the morning so hopefully the tierd feeling will happen at bedtime. I do feel detatched as in other comments and sometimes emotionless, but it is better than being depressed or anxious. The only side effect so far is nausia but never to the point that I feel I need to throw up. I also have a lack of appitite which is good since I was over eating due to the depression and anxiety. Sexual expierence has not changed in any way. Overall I am happy so far,we will see how the next couple of weeks go.

3381$Major Depressive Disorder$2/11/2009 10:26:34 PM$Reviewer: galinda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$"I have been taking Cymbalta (60 mg) since November 25, 2008 - 10 weeks. I felt immediate (approx 3-4 days) relief from my depression and anxiety (I tried 2 other antidepressants in September and October). I was surprized to find that I also lost the desire to overeat or self medicate.

I have returned to work full time (the depression started November of 05 - I worked on and off until July 07, then I was off work for 6 months). I am able to focus more (I could barely write a check before). I am not nearly as clear as I was before the depression but I can function for the first time in several years.

There have been some disturbing side effects - very blurry vision, shortness of breath, and rather scary dizziness. I also feel rather detached - or perhaps it is just that I am not catastrophizing so much - I do not feel the need to analyze absolutely everything.

These side effects scare me - I resorted to meds as I HAD to go back to work or I would have been homeless. I have also begun to have a tic (blinking my eyes) - one I had when I tried prozac years (16) ago (the last time I took antidepressants). 

Would I rather not take this medicine? Yes. Did it save me at a critical point? Absolutely."

3386$Major Depressive Disorder$2/11/2009 10:13:24 AM$Reviewer: Beth, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking 30mg of Cymbalta every night for several months, with little to no side effects.  There have been times when I forgot to take my pill at night, and I took it the next night, with no problems.  Now that I'm in a relationship, I can comment that I've experienced no sexual side effects.  I have no trouble physically responding, or reaching a climax, which goes against what others have written here.  My emotions are not dulled; I experience a range, without feeling stuck in neutral.  Occasionally, I get a touch of constipation, but nothing a little mineral oil or castor oil won't fix.  And I am diligent about not taking aspirin or ibuprofen, or using antacids, since they interact badly with the Cymbalta.  I haven't had a cold yet, and I've read that most cold/cough remedies are off-limits for Cymbalta users, so I've got to figure out what I can take, instead.  Overall, I'm very happy with my experiences with Cymbalta, and though there are many negative reports about it, I believe it can and does work for some people!

People have to realize that when you take medicine like this, you have to not miss a dose.  The feeling is horrible.  As long as I take my medicine, everything seems to be fine and I even wonder whether I need it any more.  I take 60 mg. a day.  I have taken several other anti-depressants and this works best for me.  When I was taking Effexor for several years and I missed my dose, I had horrible brain dizziness and became suicidal.  That is not a good combination.  Hopefully, people who read this will understand how important it is to take this everyday.

My dr. just added welbutrin which I haven't started yet for a little bit more energy. At first Cymbalta made me very tired and yawned all day. I guess it stuck with me for all those years. But I am satisfied with what it does with my depression.

So my Doctor put me on Cymbalta 60 mg. I've been on it for about a year now. It helped with the depression, but makes me very irritable and angry for no reason. My Doctor tried to wean me off and I had horrible BRAIN ZAPS. Yes it may work but if you forget to take it the brain zaps will remind you. I do not reccomend starting this drug if you haven't yet. If you expierence bad side effects report it to the FDA MEDWATCH.COM. It won't surprise me if this drug is taken off the market and lawsuits follow.

I am an online college student, diabetic, single mom of 2 special needs kids. I was so depressed that I couldnt even LOOK at my textbooks, fell behind, got extensions, still fell behind....I was a MESS! My doctor wnated to try cymbalta a while ago, but my HMO refused, as they're covering only generics. My doctor got me the med for free, and on only 30 mg. once a day in the morning, I am starting to be ME again! In the one week I have been on cymbalta, I have taken 2 tests for my college courses, and got an 87 and a 100! I am not as sleepy and lethargic as I was, and NO weight gain! First day only was a bit rocky-felt a bit speedy and cloudy, but I decided to go with taking it early a.m and with food, and I am so very happy! I know people don't believe in wonder drugs, but for me, that is exactly what cymbalta is-a wonder drug. You never know HOW depressed you are until something like cymbalta comes along and lifts that heavy, dark, seemingly endless curtain of despair and hopelessness! Please, if you are depressed, try it! I can only hope and pray it will work as well for you as it has for me! I LOVE it!

However, within 2 days of stopping the drug I started having severe withdraw symptoms (panic attacks, insomnia, paranoia, extreme anger, feelings of being electrocuted every few seconds!, and suicidal ideation).  My psychiatrist is now trying to force me back on it or she will not continue seeing me as a patient.  After going off of it for 5 weeks, I reluctantly went back on 30 mg for one week but she wants me on 60mg.  I have taken as much as 120mg while hospitalized but I was a zombie.  The decision of going back on Cymbalta or not is causing more suicidal thoughts/plans.  I thought this drug was supposed to help.  If I end up back in the hospital they will just force it into me as they did before.

I personally do not take Cymbalta but a close family friend does.  This is effective when being used, and I'm pretty sure it is pretty easy for him to use. I want to say that I have never been so sared of this man in all my life until just a week or so ago.  He ran out of his pills and it was a Sunday so the pharmacy wasnt open. No words can describe what this drug has done. I went over to their house to help with the draft horses.  It all started when the harnesses somehow got switched, and thats when it all started.  He was screaming about everything, cussing constantly and I finally understood waht his wife has described to be before.  I was so scared, and I was with him alone in the barn plus 2 horses scared to death! He is ""addicted"" to it and can never come off of it ever.  If he did he would probably kill sombody, and Im dead serious about that.  This drug made him like this, I dead set on that!  He was never like this before he was put on this.  I hope and pray to God that nobody ever has to go through the things I have been through. I hope the makers of Cymbalta are happy about what they have done to him and all who care about him."

I have been on the medication for 2 months now and feel better than i have in months. I wish you all could have the same results I have.  Hang in there though, there IS a medication out there that is right for you.  It just takes a little time to find out what works with your body chemistry. Good Luck to all!!

I've even forgotten to take my nightly dose, and I haven't suffered any of the withdrawal-like suffering symptoms that others have described here.  I'm also happy to report that it hasn't impeded any sort of sexual desire or physical responses.  Considering that so many people have listed this as the major drawback of the drug; I feel lucky that everything in that department is normal for me.  I feel guilty that I'm having such a good experience with this medication, because so many of these testimonials read like horror stories.  But I have to be honest; Cymbalta is a very good medication, at least for me.

It decreased my sexual desire, put me in a dull state of mind, and made me very angry and suicidal.  When I figured it out, I was to taper down the Cymbalt over a 2 week period, then go o Prozac.

I have been on every anti-depressant imaginable.  It seems nothing works for me and my M.D. told me that Cymbalta not only works on the serotonin but also the norepromine.  
I guess I will just have to wait and see as I feel Cymbalta is my last hope.  Yeah, I'm, scared that it won't work.  I also suffer from panic/anxiety attacks.  My doctor(psychiatrist)also has me on Clonazepam, Lithium, Trazadone, and Concerta.
I have been on Clonzapam so long I can no longer feel the effects of it but it does stop the panic attacts from coming..thank God!!  I still have the anxiety that can be very overwhelming at times.
I'm on Lithium to help the anti-depressant more effectively.  No, I'm not bi-polar.  I'm on Trazadone for sleep.  I do NOT like the way it makes me feel such as a racing heart and nervousness.  But it does put me to sleep.  Hate it though!!  I'm on Concerta since I have just been diagnosed with adult ADD.  I know there's no magic cure but I at least need a reprieve from the debilitating depression and anxiety.  I feel like a guinea pig with all the medications I've been given.   "

I gained 35lbs+ while taking this medication.  The anxious feeling was increased while on this medication.  I finally went to a different doctor who actually listened to my complaints and agreed to help me wean myself off of it.  BEWARE!!!  The withdrawal symptoms are absolutely horrible.  It has been 2 months since I started the process of getting of the medicine.  There is a horribly scary feeling called ""brain zaps.""  Basically, the neurotransmitters in your brain are fighting to find the Cymbalta it's so used to having...the result is that you feel incredibly dizzy and panicked.  The ""zaps"" occurred almost every minute.  The withdrawal symptoms were so bad.....I found myself relating to how drug addicts feel when they are ""coming down.""  Please talk with your doctor about the possible withdrawal symptoms.  Check out blogs of other people who have gone through the withdrawal.  Some day....the drug company may face a lawsuit.  "

I have been treated for depression for 7 years and have tried over 5 medications during that time.  I was on prozac for a long time, until the Prozac Poop-out hit and it no longer worked.  One of the frustrating things about depression and the way our bodies metabolize the medications is that the medication can stop working at any time & not all medications work on all people.  Some of the problems that people listed below, I experience on other drugs.  For me Cymbalta is my miracle drug, keeping me on an even keel with very few depressive episodes, and even helping with my peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) in my feet that I acquired from a chemo drug.  I am definately more ""ME"" on it.  No drug will work for all people or even forever.  If it doesn't work for you, be persistant in looking for alternatives.  Work with a psychiatrist who knows all the medications/combinations available.  Don't take ""NO"" for an answer - only you know how you feel and only you will know when you have found the right drug.  Be your own health advocate or find someone to be one for you!  Best wishes to all for whom this doesn't work - keep pushing for the right drug - from someone who WILL BE on antidepresants for life!  (and not ashamed of it!) "

During the holidays, there were several occasions in which I couldn't take my nightly dose until much later than normal, and I still felt fine.  I didn't get nauseated, like I did in the beginning.  Also, I've noticed that it doesn't make me sleepy about an hour and a half later, like it used to.  The constipation isn't an issue anymore, either.  I guess I had to get used to it.  Anyway, I'm confident in giving it a 5-star rating in all the categories above.  I have noticed that I pee more, now, but that may or may not be connected to the medication.  I just have to be diligent in remembering to stay away from aspirin and ibuprofen.  I've switched to Tylenol, for the rare instances that I have a headache now.  Things are good; the Holiday season didn't depress me, or even make me sad, like it usually has.  At this point, I'm really grateful for Cymbalta.

Shortly after starting it, I started having major panic attacks, something I had never had before. Then dizziness, heart palpitations, high blood pressure. My doctor started to ween me off, and the side affects of that were completely aweful. The nausea and dizziness were so bad I couldn't even get off the couch, the panic attacks were extreme.  I ended up taking a bottle of Xanax to try to alleviate the side affects. It was aweful, not something I would do normally. This drug is evil. EVIL!
Now I am on a cocktail of meds, doing well, but I fear that I will never be able to stop taking an antidepressant or antianxiety meds ever again, and I feel it is due to what Cymbalta did to me. 
I wrote Eli Lilly and told them what happened to me, no response, they didn't care. All they want is the money.

Stay away from this drug. After what happened to me, I started reading up on Cymbalta, a totally healthy woman, with no history of mental issues, commited suicide while taking Cymbalta during one of their trials. The company still has no explanation for it.

For me it was a lifesaver. I have suffered from severe depression all of my life, later diagnosed with bi-polar but with my depression I suffered from a lot of pain due to it. Cymbalta has alleviated most if not all of those symptoms most days, all other anti depressants just were not strong enough. I have not had any side effects except dependancy which i would also warn that this is not for seasonal or situational depression, you should plan on being on cymbalta for the long haul. I get what feels like electric shocks to my brain when i miss a few doses so i fixed that by not missing a dose.

I've read so many scary things about this medication, that I'm afraid to take more than the 30mg's that I need.  So, I've been opening the capsules(!) and dividing the beads/pellets in half, and taking half each night, and saving the other for the next night.  As ridiculous as it sounds, it's working. When I go back for a checkup, I'm asking for a new script for the 30mg capsules, so I won't have to tamper with my medication, just to take the right amount.  That makes me wonder if some of the folks who are experiencing all sorts of extreme physical responses are being over-dosed by their doctors?  I get the impression that this drug is very strong, so it makes sense that too much would cause huge problems...?  I have also noticed that the dry mouth I experienced at first has dissipated, as has the constipation.  The only real side effect for me is sleepiness, which is why I take it at night. (I'm single, so I don't care if there are sexual side effects.)  Overall, I'm glad that Cymbalta is working so well for me.  It's been a God-send, as I was at my limit, before.  I was to the point of offing myself, before, just to escape the desolation of hating my life and myself.  So, I'm thankful for Cymbalta's effectiveness, as I feel like a regular person, now.  I don't know what I'll do, if it stops working.

Tried several other anti-depressants over the years (am a chronic pain patient and pain usually equals depression), but none ever caused Panic Attacks!  Also, suicidal thoughts.  Have talked with SEVERAL other patients that had similar reactions.  They thought they were crazy, but it's this ""medication"".  This is a DANGEROUS medication and should not be tried.  Withdrawals are horrific.  I have never said that about any drug before, but this one is seriously dangerous.  Please stay clear of it!"

I felt happy-calm, in control, and energized. Over time (I've been on it for over two years.), I have less and less of the extra energy and more chronic pain. Although I'm not sad, I'm not happy either. I miss having a normal range of emotion. Also, missing a dose or trying to wean myself off has left me with debilitating headaches. So, I guess I'm just stuck taking it...forever.

It made me so aggitated and uncomfortable. It may work for some people who have pain associated with depression.
I have found an alternative anti-depressant on line called PROTAZEN. It has amino acids, herbs, and Sam-e. No St. Johns Wort. It helps restore the neurotransmitters in your brain and help you feel calmer. In just two weeks I feel more hopeful, comfortable and less depressed. I can't wait to see how it works in a month. This is the first testimonial I have given for anything, I get nothing for writing this, just to help people find the relief I was looking for. I suffered needlessly for years and I hope I can shorten that time for others. Check it out for yourselves, www.protazen.com.
Peace and never give up. Life is worth it, when you are well."

Cymbalta has been a miracle for me. It took about 6 weeks for me to enjoy the full effects, feeling happiness & satisfaction again.  2 drawbacks are THE PRICE (I had to wean myself off of it when we couldn't afford health insurance and experienced a relapse within 2 months) and I experienced severe insomnia. I again tried many different meds for sleeping, finally I've got the right combo. I take 60mg Cymbalta in the morning and 100mg Trazodone at night. I sleep, dream, and feel good when i'm awake.

I was in a fog and did not even realize it.  I could not tell that it helped with any body aches.  I went off of it a little over a year ago and boy, it was rough coming off of it!  I was suicidal and homicidal for weeks.  I gradually lowered my dose from I believe 60 to 40 to 20 and then off over four months.  I tried to come off it faster in the beginning and the doctor raised my dose back up due to side effects of coming off too fast for my body.  If you are thinking about taking Cymbalta, I would suggest you try other options first.  There are plenty of medicines that can give the same benefits without the side effects when coming off the drug.

Overall, I feel more grounded and the hair-trigger temper I was experiencing because of the depression has stopped.

I recently had been off antidepressants for a year, but believe that my depression is more seasonal, so my health care provider suggested Cymbalta during the winter months.  I took it for about a week.  At first, I was severly sick to my stomach, but that did pass.  In one week, my ability to have an orgasm stopped.  It was literally like a light switch being turned off.  I went off of the Cymabalta two weeks ago, because the sexual side effects were so prominent.  Since stopping the Cymabalta, I have had severe dizziness and headaches (I was only taking 30 mg).  This is probably the worst antidepressant I have been on, second only to Zoloft, which did not do a thing.  It is too bad that these antidepressants take away a person's sexual desire. I wonder if the drug companies are working on fixing that significant problem.

My mood was better, but I was tired all the time.  I gained 20 pounds during this time.  My legs feel jumpy and restless, especially at the end of the day when trying to relax.  I recently tapered off the med, but am having withdrawal symptoms even after 11 days of being off the med.  I had to taper to 30 mg a day for a month, then 30 mg every other day for a few weeks, then 30 mg every third day for a few weeks, then every fourth day for a few weeks.  The first time I tried to stop after 30 mg every other day for a week, I had headaches and lightheadedness.  Since stopping, I have lightheadedness off and on throughout the day, along with what feels like ""brain zaps.""  Some days I don't have any energy to do anything.  Other days are okay.

I am still on it but lost my job and w/o insurance it is VERY expensive.  In the last year I have gained at least 35 lbs and am EXTREMELY hungry ALL the time.  I am overweight and I am now going to the doctor to find out alternatives.  I did lose all my sex drive too.  But I don't cry and I am not moody unless I take antibiotics.  I recommend it to someone who cries for no reason to get through it!  I responded well to Prozac but it quit working and had to increase it.  Then tried Wellbutron and it worked well on my sex drive, but it upset my stomach.  Lexapro was AWESOME but would quit after 3 months.  Effexor did nothing for me.  I think I will go back to Lexapro.

Started out with 30 mg...felt like I was mad at the world even had a few words with others at work. After increasing my dose to 60 MG (30 MG twice a day) I'm feeling good in the depression area, but have bouts of IBS and dry mouth...also have gained about 20 pounds. I've been on and off of depression medication for over 20 years. I like to go off of meds from time to time to see if I can handle life. I'm wondering if I should go off of it, but after reading about withdrawal I'm nervous. I will wait until this spring before I decide to work with my doctor to get off of it. I also have experenced being light headed, dizzy and stomach upset when I miss a dose. I don't think I would have started this medication if I would have known about it's additive nature.
3595$Major Depressive Disorder$12/4/2008 2:44:20 PM$Reviewer: Beth, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$"One thing I've noticed, using Cymbalta, is that it clears the depressive thoughts and negative mentality, so that I can realize and evaluate things in my life that aren't working.  For example, I hate my job.  I now realize that hating my job contributes a great deal toward the depression and negative outlook that descends over me, when the depression gets bad.  So, is hating my job (since it takes up a huge part of my life) causing most of the depression?  And, if I had a good, great-paying job, would I still get depressed and want to die?  I can't remember being caught up in severe depression the few times I've ever had jobs I loved.  At least now, using Cymbalta, I can take an evaluative look at my life, instead of just wanting to die, in order to stop feeling horrible.  Taking the drug clears my outlook enough to help me see that I need to make some changes.  Cymbalta helps me feel more able to move forward with my life, and gives me the strength to work on positive change.  The depression episodes tend to play mind games with me.  During them, it feels like everything is hopeless, and I'm too worn down and tired to fight any longer.  Cymbalta is helping me see that's not really the truth about my reality.  Overall, I guess it's worth risking the potentially dangerous side effects and/or withdrawal effects of this drug.  I'm thankful to feel better about my situation and my life.  This is the closest to normal I've felt, other than the first little while I was on Prozac.  I've never been a ""happy"" person, but at least Cymbalta helps me feel OK about it."

The brain zaps from before stopped immediately.  I sleep better.  I do get dry mouth now, and constipation is now a big concern.  But I've felt much better, from the start.  I've found that when I take the 30mg capsule with food, it doesn't make me feel nauseous.  I take it at night, because it does make me sleepy about an hour or so later. I don't smoke or drink, which interacts with the medication, and I can't take ibuprofen or aspirin.  Overall, I've been pleasantly surprised with my results, especially considering the alarming reports others have posted about their experiences with Cymbalta.  I'm glad I have insurance, so I get it with a $25 co-pay, as it costs $150 full-retail.  So far, I can say that this drug gives me the kind of great results that Prozac did, the first several years that I took it.  I'm happy with the 30mg dose, so I'm not going to increase to 60mg, which is the standard dose.  I hope I don't develop a tolerance to it, over time.  I'll post again later on, from time to time, to monitor my experiences with Cymbalta."

This medicine has been an absolute nightmare. At first it seemed great- I started having a lot of good days where I felt wonderful. But God forbid I ever took it more than a few minutes later than usual, or missed a dose. My doctor is tapering me off of the medication because I told her the side effects aren't worth it anymore. I was taking only 40mg for the last 6 months, and I'm now down to 30mg for the 4th day. Between the cold sweats, sudden decrease in appetite, and ""brain zaps"" (yes, they're real!), I can't stand to do anything but sit on my couch.
I really need some help from someone that has gone through this too. I'm frequently getting those “brain zaps”, terrible constipation, stomach pain, and what feels like acid reflux.  And to top it all off, I constantly feel like I’m on the verge of tears.  I hate to get graphic, but I feel like I have something stuck in my stomach that is preventing me from going to the bathroom, and when I do, it's sudden diarrhea.

3623$Major Depressive Disorder$11/25/2008 11:20:54 AM$Reviewer: Beth, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$"  I was prescribed Cymbalta after Prozac stopped working for me.  I take 30 mg at night.  It started working quickly.  I take it with food, so I won't feel nauseated, and I take it at night, because it makes me sleepy.  It causes constipation, so I have to deal with that, but it's a small price to pay for feeling better.
  I admit that the scary testimonials I've read here gave me pause, but at this point, I'm desperate to feel decent and to not hate my life.  I'll keep posting, from time to time, and describe my experiences on Cymbalta.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained...right?"

I had very low seratonin levels, I sat around and cried alot, slept alot and everything that happened (no matter how small)seemed detrimental and life threatening. It took about 30 days to really get this med into my body and bloodstream....there's been nothing like it in the past. At one time I was on Effexor which I couldn't wait to get off of because of the side effects. The only real side effect from Cymbalta that bothers me is constipation, but I can live with that a whole lot easier than the ""depression""."

I wouldn't say it's great for pain but has had an excellent effect on my depression. The side effects are nasty though, sleepless nights, dry mouth, and all kinds of stomach issues for the first few weeks. If you can hang on this drug is great. I still don't sleep well but everything else has gone away. The only issues is if you forget to take it, you feel like crap. You will be very sick to your stomach, and your mood plummets only after 24 hours. I do recommended this drug but be careful to take it everyday.

However, I started developing some neurological concerns and was told to wean myself off of this medication.When I started noticing these concerns, I spent almost $6000 in medical bills to find out this was the culprit. I thought I was going to die from all the Neuro side effects.   I started taking 60mg a few years ago once per day and am now in Day 7 of 30mg and I must tell you this is not my ""cup of tea"".  The withdrawal symptoms are unbelievable.  I have felt like I am ""out of touch with society"".  The  withdrawal symptoms have included: crying spells, extreme fatigue, body aches, chills, nausea, vertigo, gait issues, headaches, skin problems (sores), memory loss, nerve pain, lack of energy, depression, no appetite, can NOT drive due to feeling off balance, trouble sleeping at night (waking up frequently) I must say, I will NEVER take this medication again once I get off of it. I have NEVER felt like this before.  I just know that once I get completely off of this medication, I will definately read ALL the fine print from other anti-depression, bi-polar medications again. I really did not think I would have so much of a problem weaning myself off. My family is very concerned. "

My doctor put me on Lexapro to taper off all meds.

I woke up at least 5x an hour every night.  Dr. gave me a number of different sleep meds to counteract it, but they didn't help.  On 60mg Cymbalta, all of a sudden I could sleep through the night for the first time in years!  Even before Lexapro I think the depression was causing night waking.  Pros: Cymbalta has worked for my depression and anxiety.  Also, the sexual side effects (no sex drive, no orgasms) that I had with Lexapro disappeared!  Cons: I have been on it for 5 months now and have bouts of dizziness/vertigo when I turn my head too fast, as well as constipation.  I've also developed on and off stomach pain in my upper abdomen and am not sure if it's from the medicine itself or if it's related to the constipation.  I'm definitely better off with it, so I'm tolerating the side effects.  However, I have to say I'm scared of the day I come off it - there are some very scary withdrawal stories on this site.

I went back into the Dr this past summer as I was tired of being tired all of the time. My body ached constantly and I took ibuprofen 2 to 3 times a day.  I had no desire to do anything, go anywhere or socialize.  My Dr started me on Cymbalta. After the first 2 weeks, I realized I was not popping ibuprofen all of the time, my energy level was back up and I started to enjoy life again.  A few months went by and I started feeling like I was going backwards.  I called my Dr and made another appointment.  She increased my dosage.  Withing a week, I was feeling great again.  I can honestly say this drug has worked for me.  While it may not work for others, please remember it is very important to see your Dr every few months to review your medication as somethng may work better for you or you may just need an adjustment in your dosage.

However,  the side effects were NOT worth it. Unfortunately the side effects that I had were terrible. EXTREME sweating, high weight gain( which causes more depression), body aches, etc.  The worse being the erythema multiforme, sores on my body that were terrible. Extremely sensitive to touch and would not heal. This is a rare side effect and took much investigating to discover what I had and why. I am still trying to get a doctor to help me get rid of these sores. The medicine has lots of side effects while you are coimng off of it also.  Go to Cymbalta.com and read ALL the side effects before you try this medicine. Read the posts and BELIEVE these people.

3761$Major Depressive Disorder$10/10/2008 9:41:35 AM$Reviewer: Quilter, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$5$I tried Cymbalta because I wasn't getting full coverage of depression symptoms on current Zoloft/Wellbutrin combo of several years. I had a HORRIBLE reaction to Cymbalta. Sleep disturbances including severe nightmares, night sweats & insomnia. I had racing & spiraling thoughts, felt like I was not in control of my mind, agitation, restlessness, overwhelming sadness, crying, suicidal ideation, & pressured thoughts.  I had intrusive thoughts grounded in past traumatic life events and one thought would rapidly spiral to another. These events occurred over a 3 week period under a doctor's care.  I had no concentration, did not trust myself to drive, couldn't tolerate a lot of noise or activity around me and had awkward social interactions.  Over the past twenty years I have had success with Prozac, Paxil, Wellbutrin & Zoloft but never a reaction like I had to this drug. I have an advanced professional degree, and consider myself an informed consumer.  This was a horrible experience for me.
3763$Major Depressive Disorder$10/9/2008 11:51:44 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$2$5$While taking Cymbalta I felt better than I have ever felt. I was able to do more and had more confidence. It gave me that false sense of everything being perfect. BUT it made me sweat SO bad. Going to the gym was embarrassing, walking outside, pretty much doing anything that required physical movement ended with me being covered in sweat. Nights were by far the worst - I would wake up several times a night soaking wet with sweat. I decided to come off of it about a month and a half ago - my doctor cut the dosage slowly and then had me go every other day and every third day. Unfortunately, I am still feeling the withdraw symptoms pretty badly. I get dizzy and nauseated a lot and still sweat quite a bit. If I had known this would be so hard to come off of I would have stuck with the depression! It has been 11 days since I have taken any dosage - hopefully it will get better soon.

Have been weaning off for almost 10 weeks, tapering down from 30mg/day to 15mg/per day to half dose to every other day dose, etc etc....and now I've been totally off for over a week and I STILL have constant withdrawal symptoms of dizziness, vertigo-like rushes, and a subtle feeling almost like the on-set of a seizure, etc. Certain side effects don't surprise me; it just goes along with the territory but these ongoing withdrawal symptoms are concerning, especially after being so careful to decrease dosage slowly and because they are not lessening in frequency or severity. My doc wants me to start up on something else but I want to KNOW when this drug will not be effecting me anymore first - I am trying to be patient with the ""normal"" (?) symptoms of being off antidepressants like crying and changes in mood/sleep, etc -- until I know this drug is out of my system. It's weird and I wonder if even those people who respond well ON this drug would have this adverse effect getting OFF of it. Not something to look forward to, believe me. "

3791$Major Depressive Disorder$9/29/2008 5:14:10 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$1$3$"I am a 18 year old male who took Cymbalta for a little less then a year. Everything was fine until I began to notice that the symptoms of my depression were returning. This wasn't itself unusual because in the past the effectiveness of other anti-depressants would slowly wear off over time as well. With Cymbalta however, I had a unique experience that I am still suffering through today and one that I would not wish on my worst enemies. Two days after I stopped taking it, my memory, concentration, and happiness decreased to a hellish level. I would frequently have ""brain zaps"" and uncontrollable crying spells, as well as extreme paranoia (I thought it was the end of me). I began to feel out of touch with reality and even my eyesight began to seem fuzzy and dreamlike. Physically, I could not keep food down and threw up constantly as well experiencing digestive problems. My psychiatrist didn't know what was happening, so, as hard as it was with my apathy, I took it upon myself to discover what was going on. I scoured the internet until I came upon information documenting ""SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome."" I'm sure others here have commented on it, because it apparently is not an isolated condition. It was a living hell, and six months later, although a different medication(Prozac) has helped, I still feel the effects. It's a rare occurrence, and I know how devastating depression is, but take my advice and be careful before you use this or any other SSRI. And, if you ultimately do decide upon Cymbalta, make sure that you taper yourself of very gradually; the consequences are beyond what I ever imagined even on my worst days of depression. Be safe, good luck."

3878$Major Depressive Disorder$8/26/2008 7:56:12 AM$Reviewer: Paula857, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I started taking Cymbalta about 6 mos. ago. I had been on Zoloft in the past and did not want to use anti-depressants again, but this one was different.  It treated all of my symptoms and that included anxiety. THE DOWN SIDE IS, and I wish Doctors would make it clearer, that if you miss a couple of doses, you could have bad withdrawal symptoms.  I didn't have money and missed a couple days, no big deal right? Wrong! I started having these ""shock"" feelings.  Since I have a heart condition, I called the Dr. but got no response. I started searching internet and found that ""startling"" or whatever I was feeling was common for Anxiety patients.  That led me to Cymbalta & side effects of going off it, and sure enough.  
They called it ""brain zaps"", ""brain shocks"" and so forth. It felt like electric shocks going through my body repeatedly and randomly.  Stress seemed to make it worse.  

Apparently, you have to taper off very slowly. One lady even went so far as to open the capsule, count the tiny beads and gradually reduce the amount in each pill! 

I LOVE THIS drug otherwise!! I actually feel good for the first time in years.  
Not drugged; just good! I would recommend it to anyone not satisfied with other anti-dep. and those with fibromyalgia.  A lot of aches & pains I was having went away with Cymbalta.
I don't really feel any side effects either.  [Zoloft made me nervous and couldn't sleep or eat, so Dr. gave me Xanax, which is highly addictive. That’s another story.]

3879$Major Depressive Disorder$8/25/2008 11:25:01 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"This was a miracle drug for me.  Work stresses had begun to manifest several symptoms in me, the most notable being high blood pressure.  (I had gone from 130/85 to 200/100.)
I was given lysinopril for the blood pressure, and it only worked when I was at work; it made me sick otherwise.  It lowered my blood pressure too much.  My physician also gave me cymbalta.  That was a different story.
After a couple days of taking cymbalta, I realized something was different; my spinal cord stopped aching.  I didn't even realize that it had started aching.  I sure noticed when it stopped.  Instead of ""longing for death"" (just an expression, not truly literal.) I began to feel hopeful that I could take control of my life again.  It gave me the space and the perspective to make changes in my life.  A new job on the horizon, laughter with my wife and I've been off all medication for over a year.  That's the great thing.  I only needed to take the cymbalta for 3-4 months.  
I've heard that the best depression treatment results occur when the first medicine works.  If you are looking for that first treatment and you ache from depression and feel like there is no solution possible, consider asking your doctor for cymbalta.

I was supposed to increase it to 60mg after one week.  However I had to stop it after 5 days due to headaches.  The headaches started the day after I started Cymbalta and increased in intensity each day.  You're not supposed to take ibuprofen or triptans with this med.  I was feeling a slight boost in mood after 3 days with Cymbalta, but the headaches impacted my ability to think and function.  Now I'm trying Lexapro.  Hopefully that will help.

I still have my normal drive and sex still feels great... however, I really can't orgasm while taking it. (That's why I rated ""satisfaction"" only 4 stars.) I will be asking my Dr. to add wellbutrin to counteract this. Overall, I think this is a GREAT medication! "

For the past three months or so I've found myself drinking much more than I have since my days in college. (I'm 62 so that should give you an idea.) I've never been a teetotaler. I like wine and beer but always have been able to control my intake. However, since starting on Cymbalta once I start drinking (especially red wine) I find myself unable to stop. I've had more hangovers in the past three months than I've had in 40 years. There's a connection but only we who take Cymbalta seem to know about it. What's the use of not being depressed if you turn into a drunk? BTW, read health sites and you'll find my situation is quite common.

I then tried to stop taking it and experienced the delayed reaction and electric shocks.  I didn't realize it was because of the withdrawal and went to my doctor who upped my dosage to 60 mg daily.  The sweating, sleeplessness, fatigue and weight gain have become unbearable.  Plus, in researching I now know all the symptoms I was having could be attributed to the meds.  Four days ago I quit cold turkey again.  I am having the same withdrawal symptoms as before.  Someone please tell me how long this will last.  It is horrible.  Had I known Cymbalta 30 caused this before, I would never have started taking it.  The side effects outweigh any benefit I had from the medication.  Trying to stop taking Cymbalta is horrible.

I lashed out at my family and went on crying jags about unreasonable things. I gradually increased my dosage from 30 to 60 mg, with the main side effects being nausea and lack of appetite which lasted for 1-2 months. I'm thrilled with the emotional results of this medication. I feel like I've been balenced out, and I'm no longer set out of alignment by the littlest thing. I even call it my ""happy medicine."" A month ago I started to have very vivid dreams every night, which I'd never had in the past. This is a known side effect of Cymbalta, and after the dreams started getting more and more disturbing my doctor and I decided to reduce my dosage back to 30 mg. The dreams are still there, but they're less weird. Ultimately if they keep effecting my sleep I'm going to phase out and change to Effexor, but the mood effects of this drug are so good I'm hesitant to switch. I haven't had any weight fluctuations with it, either. Really, it's a helpful drug."

I also have diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia. It did give some pain relief but it made me not care about anything. I didn't/don't see a point to anything except sleeping, stopped showering even. I became withdrawn and don't go out of the house. Don't get off the couch unless I have to use the restroom or get food. Absolutely no energy. I was not suicidal before trying this medicine and it made me think about killing myself constantly. Not because of depression, just thoughts I couldn't control. I'm off of it now my doctor told me to stop it immediately. Thankfully the constant suicidal thoughts are easing up but I still have NO emotions. Nothing has a point. My neurapthy is pretty painful so it did help with pain but be careful. I want to feel better, this is awful.

After I had my dosage increased from 10-15mg I felt awful.  I immediately switched to EffexorXR.  At my highest dose of EffexorXR I was at 150mg.  I was disappointed with the sexual side effects that I was experiencing with EffexorXR, so my doctor prescribed a small dose of Welbutrin to see if it would alleviate my symptoms.

Unfortunately, the combination medication didn't help and I just felt cranky.  I decided to give Cymbalta a try.

After just a few days of being on Cymbalta, the sexual SE I was experiencing were gone!  I felt as though I'd regained my sex life!  It definitely helped me out a lot.

The only downside that I have experienced is that if I don't take my dose on time I can feel SE (for me my anxiety kicks in within a few hours, and my depression comes back in a few days if I continue to miss a few doses.  This is probably typical with most AD, though.

I'm glad I've switched to this medication!"

Could not move out of bed without help and had to be on pain meds 24-7. Good luck if you take this drug, I wouldn't.

I have come to the conclusion that many of these histrionic ppl, especially the Fibromyalgia ppl, have a co-current personality disorder.

Nov 2007 I was prescribed cymbalta, early Dec it was increased to 60mg at night and 30mg in am.  Just before Christmas I awoke one morning - and was so happy to be alive. This has occurred, but never for any length of time, on and off in my life - but into the first week of June and regardless of outside influences which have been at times traumatic - I still wake up each day happy to be alive, a mood which stays with me until the next morning.  This medication in my opinion is the miracle I had been told by age 60 I would probably never see. The change in the subconscious mood from wishing to be dead into hoping to live until 100 so I can truly live life is one of the 3 most important things that is in my life- the other two being my adult children. I would love to do a commercial and public appearances to let the world know (1.) cymbalta gave me the life I never had .. and (2.) if this does not work for someone he/she should never give up the hope of finding a med that will

My insomnia continued with Cymbalta even though I had some of it with Effexor towards the end of my taking it. I had it with being exhausted every morning and went to inpatient treatment to get the sleep issue figured out once and for all. It took a second doctor (who now has replaced my former one!) to discover that SNRIs (Effexor and Cymbalta) were causing me to wake up about many, many times during the night even though I was taking Ambien at bedtime.  Stopping the Cymbalta suddenly, as I did, caused me to feel discontinuation effects for TWO WEEKS with those darned ""brain zaps"".  We're still trying to tweak all my medications now that I've dropped Cymbalta (90 mg) and Buspar, kept the Wellbutrin XL, and have now added Abilify.  I think Cymbalta can be a great medication for a wide range of people but it just didn't work that well for me. "

I have taken Effexor the longest, 150mg. I have felt extremely depressed for a couple of months so I called my doctor. Dr. started me on 60mg Cymbalta with 75mg Effexor for one week, stepping down to 37.5mg the next week. So far, feeling better, not suffering any bad side effects, not feeling any effects withdrawing from the Effexor. I do take Provigil, 200mg, that was prescribed to counter the lethargic effect of Effexor (look up amotivational syndrome, an antidepressant effect you may not be aware of)and Ambien 10mg to counter the sleeplessness I was experiencing on the Effexor. I agree the information I've read about Cymbalta disturbs me but being depressed disturbs me more. If I missed a dose of Effexor, I could tell and if it was more than one dose, I felt ""brain zaps"" and a disconnected feeling. I think those are pretty common side effects of a lot of anti-depressants, not just Cymbalta. I hate to say this but some side effects of Cymbalta could be self-fullfilling, if you believe you will suffer ill effects, you may do just that. Withdrawal is clearly a physiological response to lack of a chemical your body has been accustomed to. I hope I have no additional weight gain as I feel the Effexor has done enough of that. A week in, so far, so good."

My understanding is that SSRI's (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Cymbalta, etc.) could have tendency to cause those issues.  But it is tricky to point the finger at SSRI's because clinical depression can cause the very symptoms I listed above.

Cymbalta is the latest.  I've noticed over the years that SSRI's (Paxil, Prozac, etc) have worked for a couple years, then stopped working or turned counterproductive for me.  The doc would then recommend a newer generation SSRI.  
Prozac actually was a breakthrough for me back in the 90's.  Then I went on Zoloft, but discontinued due to skin rashes.  Paxil worked pretty well for me, but I experienced those awful ""brain shocks"" about the 3rd year, and had to discontinue.  While on Cymbalta I've noticed within the last year a very annoying sensation of a ""gag"" reflex (coming from my throat area).  That I attribute to Cymbalta, although Lithium or Lamictal may be involved.  (I'm on 3 mainline meds.)  I've also noticed some weight gain.  I'll talk to my doc to see if it's time for switch or to make adjustments with the other 2 meds.  "

Overall, it worked great for my depression. A few months after starting, I began to gain weight despite eating right. I have also been trying to quit smoking so my doctor switched me to Wellbutrin recently. I have not taken Cymbalta for a week now and I wish I would just not wake up. I had intense withdrawals from stopping Effexor XR in the past and hoped to never experience that again. My doctor told me to discontinue Cymbalta without weaning off. I will make it a point not to see him while I am going thru the withdrawals because I just might hurt him. I have never felt so awful in my life. I have severe brain zaps that have increased within the past week, body aches, chills, visual disturbances, dizziness, extreme anger at any given moment, extreme sadness at any given moment, and thoughts of wanting to die. I have put my husband and children through hell the past week and from what I have read, it will only get worse until my body is completely free of the drug. For anyone out there thinking of beginning an antidepressant, read all you can about the drug including the withdrawal symptoms. I have taken at least six different antidepressants over the past 10 years and all of them worked, but only for awhile. I work for a neurologist who treats fibromyalia and diabetic neuropathies and have seen patients who would rather deal with the pain than the side effects of Cymbalta. I think it is strange that the clinical trials and studies have not been published regarding Cymbalta. We are like lab rats enabling these pharmacutical companies to make a profit. Depression is something no one should have to deal with but honestly, I would rather be depressed than want to kill myself. Thankfully, my family and friends have been there for me, if not, I wouldn't be here. Please research before starting any antidepressant. They only work for awhile and then you are left dealing with the horrific withdrawal symptoms.

Tried to wean off twice- with Dr. help. Extreme dizziness and fatigue,sweats, nausea, diarrhea, HORRID mood swings and crying jags occured trying to go off of it. Worse than the depression itself. Gained 30 lbs in 2 yrs- and I ran a marathon. Definitely the Cymbalta. A different Dr. combined it with Adderall to counter the fatigue I feel all of the time and to stop the weight gain.  Within the last 2 mos, started Xanax because Cymbalta doesn't help with the anxiety or panic attacks. Have a new Dr. and trying to work out a different game plan. At this point, not sure how much of me is actually depressed and how much is the medication. I want off the Cymbalta.

A few noteworthy withdrawal symptoms I encountered were irritability, brain rushes, itching and zoning out.  If I were to know in advance the withdrawal symptoms, I would have taken a nice little vacation to avoid people having to ""put up"" with my irritability.

I was taken off both Zoloft and Effexor (slowly) and started on Cymbalta. It has been a life-saver, I have felt better in the past 3 months than I have in the last 3 years. I am also seeing a therapist once a week, which also has been wonderful. I was put on Cymbalta for Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety. The medication works great but with the therapy, I am learning to re-train my brain to think a different way. I would recommend this drug. It has really turned my life around.

No crying all the time, less pain in back and knees and overall feeling so much better. I don't think Effexor ever really worked for me after trying Cymbalta. But, after the first month, I started having severe diarrhea and I am very tired all the time. I just found out that I now have IBS because from it.I have lost 15 pounds from having diarrhea 5-6 times a day. I feel like I have the flu all the time.I have become so nauseated with it, the smell of food makes me sick.I am going to try to wean myself off of this drug. I hope after only taking it for 3 months, that the withdrawl isn't as bad as I've been reading about. It's a shame it did this, beacause it really helped with my moods and depression. I hope I can find something else to work for me, without these terrible side effects. I have been through and still going through a lot of emotional stress and the last thing I need is bad withdrawl symptoms now.

I started off on Lexapro, but it didn't seem to work for long, and the sexual side effects were driving me crazier than the depression.  My psychiatrist added Wellbutrin on top of the Lexapro, but that made me feel like a maniac after just one day, so I stopped taking it.  Then he switched me to Cymbalta.  

My only concern lately is that I'm having some bouts of depression here and there.  I've been trying to take a ""mental inventory"" to decide if it's all situational depression, but this latest bout has me thinking that maybe my dosage needs to be increased, or it's time to find something else.

I have noticed the weight gain ever since I started taking this medication.  I've ballooned up about 40 pounds since I started taking Cymbalta.  I had no idea so many others were experiencing this as well.  I'm having trouble losing this weight, too.  "

I have tried several anti-depressants, but this combined with lamictal has improved things. I used to be really angry, paranoid, occationally suicidal, and would cry ALL the time. Cymbalta was added to the lamictal because I had a week of anxiety so bad I couldn't sleep and had difficulty breathing. That was on vacation in Florida!
Side effects noted were nausia the first week. I work nights, so I took it in the morning before I went to sleep to reduce this. Sexual disfunction is mostly indifference and delayed orgasm. I have been on this for about 3 months now and a couple weeksa ago I started having horrible nightmares! Really really horrible!!! I can even tell I am dreaming and cannot get out of it and if I do wake up, it will start were it left off, unless I get up for hours or the day.
I don't if these go away, but even it they don't I think I will probably continue using it.

I was a new person :)  Suddenly my gums started bleeding (don't know whether it was Cymbalta related.   I started getting really irritable and lost two of my best friends due to my overeactions to their comments.  Was heartbroken because they were the ones who suggested that I go for treatment.   I tried going cold turkey, but couldn't, so the doctor switched me to something else on a very low dosage every other day.   With this medication I had vivid dreams, sweats, buzzing in the ear (only when originally getting on and coming off this medication)

The upside to the whole experience was that I finally didn't overeact - I only wish I was naturally like that.  I was outspoken and made friends easily (something I could never do)  It was very effective but only for a short while- I wish I could have lasted on it.

Suggestion:  NEVER go cold turkey without going too the doctor.

I have tried other drugs for depression, nothing else has worked for me.  I thought Cymbalta was a wonder drug.  I was still depressed while taking it, but all of my anxiety was gone.  However, it doesn't work for me anymore!  I started to feel like I had the flu constantly...lots of joint pain, hot flashes, numbness and tingling on my face, among other things. I think I have the ""brain zaps"" that others refer to, it is such a weird feeling, like my eyes are floating around in their sockets and my brain is floating around behind my eyes!  I have stopped taking Cymbalta altogether, and of course, I feel terrible.  Insatiable hunger, high pulse rate, dizziness, terrible insomnia, frequent urination, and probably other symptoms that I am overlooking right now.  I am going to see the doctor today and I hope we can get something under control. I wish I could recommend this drug, but the withdrawal is really terrible and the benefits weren't as amazing as I thought they were when I first started taking it.  Based on other people's opinions that I have read, I don't think anyone should take it.  One user on another web site said that he had an easier time getting off of crystal meth than he did with getting off of Cymbalta.  Interesting, considering the poison that is in that drug.  It makes me sad that this drug doesn't work for me anymore.  I thought that I had finally found something after years of searching for help!  "

Anyone that can post some withdrawal schedule information, I would really appreciate it.  My Dr. wanted me to go from 90mg. daily to 60mg daily for one week, then one 60mg every other day for one week then stop.

Fatigue increased.  Felt bad all the time.  Did not want to do anything.  Knew I had to do something to feel better.  Cymbalta was the only new medication so I decided to stop taking it.  Side effects included dizziness, insomnia, mental fog. I felt like I was loosing it at times. It took about 8 weeks of decreasing the dosage   (60 mg to 30 mg) from daily to every other day, every two days, etc. before I was able to stop.  I am now free and feel like a new person.  Never again will I take cymbalta nor can I recommend it to others.  I felt like a drug addict coming down from a drug.  It was horrible.

I am glad that I went to Webmd and read about others experiences with this drug, it helped me to know what I had to look forward to.  I have the cold feet, racing pulse, sweating,brain zaps, itching, rash on my neck, nausea, (no vomiting yet), and the urge to sleep all the tine.

I didn't like the side affects - weird flushes and complete zapping of sexual drive. If a dose is missed the flushes are disturbing. I also have very weak nails and was wearing silk wraps on them when I started taking Cymbalta. After about a month the silk wraps wouldn't stay on so I went to acrylic. I ended up having to take them off. After I quit taking Cymbalta I had the wraps put back on and all was well until I tried to take it again. I haven't heard of anyone else having this side effect. It was very difficult to get off if it.

I took the med and felt great, took away neck and back pain immedietly. Then 4 weeks into it I felt hungry all the time and even after I ate a huge meal I would feel hungry. I stayed on the med for 5 months then just quit taking it because of the hunger and weight gain, despite exercising an hour 5 days a week. The withdrawl was hell, but what i didn't realize is that if you have blood sugar problems like I have (hypoglycemia) this med aggravated it and that is why I was hungry all the time and never felt full. Be sure to check thyroid first too because thyroid and depression symtoms are the same as was my case, but didn't find that out until after going through the expense of the med and hell of the withdrawl.

I tried lexapro, but that just made me want to eat nonstop. Gained 30 pounds on lexapro. I may be unable to take off the weight. 

Doc has me on 60MG of Cymbalta, and 0.5 mg of klonopin, .25 in the AM and .25 in the evening.   Strangely enough, I am not building up any tolerance to the klonopin.  It just smooths out the day.  No adverse impacts or side effects that I know of. Sometimes I think that reading the warnings are counterproductive. You may have side effects just because you think you may have them.  I am taking something because I need it.  

I am 210 pounds and taking 60mg for over a year now.

I have found it very helpful.  Before I started this medication I was on prozac for 8 years and none of the doctors would listen to me when I would tell them it was not doing the job. I was having severe panic attacks and thoughts of suicide and found that I was actually Bipolar not just depressed by my surroundings as I had been told for so many years. My children couldnt stand me and honestly I couldnt stand myself. I felt like a whole different person was running my life while I sat quietly aside and watched.
when I first started taking this medication I was still having some crying episodes I spoke with my doctor about this and he raised the amount that I take on a daily basis and all is well in life again. The only side effects that I have seen is that I have to take this medication no earlier than an hour prior to me needing to sleep because it makes me very drowsy, but for once I sleep all night!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! When I read your review, I felt like I was reading my own story -- down to the previous and ""now"" clothes sizes! And I too have been very careful about what I've been eating -- low fat, lots of vegies -- and exercising at least 5 times a week for an hour each time! To make matters worse, all the docs I've seen -- including two endocrinologists, my GP, my oncologist and my radiation oncologist -- all blamed the weight gain on the same thing -- ""well, you know you're getting older and going through menopause!"" By the last doc I talked to who looked at me once again as if to say ""yeah, well you really are eating more than you say you are,"" I was ready to jump across the desk and choke him, until...he said you know you're on three meds that can cause you to gain weight...neurontin, tamoxifen and Cymbalta. He didn't mean to, but he gave the the answer I was looking for! I can't stop taking the neurontin or tamoxifen, but I'm weaning myself off of the Cymbalta.

4210$Major Depressive Disorder$3/3/2008 11:38:24 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I took Cymbalta for 2 days and absolutely hated it. My list of side effects included: nausea, dizziness, disconnectedness, feeling like nothing mattered and nothing was enjoyable, warm and tingly skin, extreme lethargy to the point of having to lie down several times during the day. If the symptoms were all physical, i would have stuck it out hoping they would go away. But, I couldn't stand the feeling of disconnectedness and loss of joy in the activities that usually lift my spirits. My dr. added a low dose of Cymbalta to the Wellbutrin I was already taking as I was still getting depressed occasionally. But, I can't stand to feel this way, so I'm requesting that I just up my dose of Wellbutrin since it seems to work pretty well for me.

There was not nearly enough information provided to me regarding
 side effects. I am someone who actually reads the pamphlet that the pharmacist gives you.  No where to be found are the severe impact it can have on your weight. Over time, and I have been on it approximately 18 months.  Upon further investigation on my part, I have found that cymbalta actually enters your fat cells and STAYS THERE! OVER TIME the weight creeps on and on.  To top that off are the severe side effects when you are trying to ween yourself off of it.  For example, I have  gained 15 POUNDS in the two weeks while trying to eliminate cymbalta from my life. Not to mention the other awful side effects: brain zaps, mood swings, high blood pressure, urge to urinate one second & not making it to the bathroom the next, diahrea, joint pain, brain fog, adema, slurred speech and others. Think twice before using this drug. In the 18 months that I have been taking it I have gained 34 pounds. On a 5'1"" frame thats another whole person practically. I was in a size 6-8 petite, and now I am busting out size 16's.
Talk about a reason to be depressed!!! It's been 17 days and the brain zaps are almost gone and I am ""starting"" to feel like myself again-except for the weight gain. If I was eating carbs, sweets, etc. that would be one thing. But I follow a high protein, high vegetable diet.  Really consider the consequences."

For the first two weeks I was on Cymbalta (1st week 30 mg, 2nd week 60 mg, now on 90 mg), I felt like I was in a complete haze. After about a year, the only side effect I still notice is lack of sex drive, however for me this is a small price to pay in return for such major positive changes in my suicidal depression and severe anxiety.

I have put on sooo much weight it is unbelievable. I have put on over 50 lbs in the 2 years I have been taking it. I am about to start weaning off of it with my doctor's help and try something else. Also, it made my sex drive almost zilch and I used to really enjoy sex.

My Doctor tried this prior to other drugs rather quickly. The first day I had taken it( no one warns you) I had experienced severe dizziness, blurred vision, headache, and strange warm tingling throughout my body. I went to the ER due to this,and they told me that people are not always told to take it easy when your body is adjusting to it. My blood pressure went up and was then put on medication for anxiety. I was on cymbalta for 4 mths and had experienced extreme energy, but was still feeling down. When I was taken off of it, it took my body some time to withdrawl. I had numbness in my hands and fingertips and experienced headaches. Hear it does work for some, so good luck with it.

But after a battle with another drug that made the depression more exaggerated I finally confided in my doctor.  He prescribed Cymbalta 30 mg.  At first I had a roller coaster of side effects one of which was the lack of orgasm.  ( If anything I was a bit quick on the draw prior to Cymbalta). I asked my doctor on the 2 week return checkup about the minor side effects and the orgasm issue.  He said not to be quick to decide and that the side effects should subside. It has now been over 90 days and the orgasm has returned but it just takes a bit more time to reach it. My wife thinks that this is now a good side effect along with the new emotional stability, that was out of control.  I had major mood changes at the drop of the hat.  Not anymore.  We have a new relationship.  ( One Crazy Little pill).

I tried Elavil, trazadone, zoloft, paxil, prozac, wellbutrin, lexapro, and effexor with no real help. I started taking Cymbalta and in less than 2 weeks, I lost 12 pounds. I went into what was recognized by my doctor as a manic phase.I couldn't sleep at night, which made the manic phase worse. My symptoms of rapid cycling lasted for about 6 weeks, which can be exhausting when it's over. The ride back down is ten times worse than the depression I had been dealing with over the last few years.  I had only had an episode of mania once before this, so with this second episode, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I used the websites tools to track my moods and meds. It is a very helpful tool to use to communicate with the doctor. This was the first medication that I used that helped my depression, but be careful. If you are bipolar and don't know it, this medication can really bring it on. Also, be extra careful taking this medication with Ambien. I was on the two and started sleepwalking 4 or 5 nights a week. I also had very vivid nightmares and lots of waking up soaked in sweat. This is a very good medication when used appropriately. As with any medication like this, give it at least 3 weeks before deciding it is not working.
4319$Major Depressive Disorder$1/21/2008 2:46:17 PM$Reviewer: cloudyZZ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$4$I have been on cymbalta for 2 months.  I have extreme dry mouth, heart racing, blood pressure went up, put on 10lbs,no orgasams&no interest in sex(this is a big deal). I started on 30mg then the doctor raised me to 60mg even though I had those symptoms at 30mg Why raise the dose? Hes the doctor so I went with it. I did like the fact that I didn't fly off the handle with my kids and was able to remain calm with them. I began to feel sleepy more often and was sleeping during the day with my 4 year old asking me to get up and feed her lunch. I have not shown up at school functions that I was schedule for or take my daughter to preschool where I have to help teach there from time to time-the feeling was I just didn't want to go I rather cuddle up on the comfy chair with a blanket. Now I told my doctor this 6 days ago about all of this. Did I mention I also take Lunesta to sleep at night because I can't sleep this Cymbalta doesn't help me sleep either(doc recommended I take it at night before bed to help me sleep. I have now went off of this cymbalta for the last 3 nights. Doc will be mad but hey hes not listening!! I had some headaches,dizzy not bad but I already feel like having sex and can enjoy IT!!YEAH. Not sleeping during the day. I felt like cleaning my house again again and participating at school. Is this the right drug for me I don't think so but it may work for you. Watch your symptoms and hopefully your doctor will listen and you decide am I feeling better? Have your spouse or significant other tell or ask you how do you feel today? or get their insight on how you have been acting they are a big help too!! Good luck--feel better.

I took this medication for 5 months, and finally had to say enough is enough.  Being depressed is hard enough, but when you can't go out into public with out vomitting, or having diarhea in your pants that's more depressing!  I strongly advise that you speak with your doctor about side effects before taking this drug.  It also caused me to have high fever, and esophagus problems.

It really is. I love it and I'm grateful that I can finally take somthing that works for me. Very very grateful actually!

Once I started taking this I couldn't go anywhere though, not to the grocery store or anywhere that there were alot of people or noise, I couldn't handle it. In fact I still can't be in the grocery store during peak times, I have to shop in the middle of the night or I get to antsy and I can't breath. I stopped taking Cymbalta when I was watching some stupid commercial, I think it was Geico, and I started crying for no reason.  Not sure what the next move is.  I guess, just keep getting up and trying to keep busy.

When I was placed on Cymbalta (after many failed attemps with other treatments) the physical side effects became almost non-existant within the first few weeks.  I have now been on Cymbalta for over a year.  I think this is one that can really help me.

4465$Major Depressive Disorder$11/28/2007 8:06:27 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"I have been on Cymbalta for about 8 months now after being on 150mg of Effexor XR (450mg Effexor XR) 5 years ago but I tapered down myself. But NEVER totally get off of it if you have been at a high dosage for a year or more, I thought the world was coming to an end, crying etc.  Then I took a 75mg from my Psy and in a couple hours I was ok.  The Cymbalta I started 8 months ago was a 60mg pill by my family Dr. replacing the 150mg Effexor XR (Burn out or tolerance) and the change over was no problem and it did benefit I think, it's hard to tell.  So...I wnet to a Psychiatrist and he doubled the Cymbalta to 120 mg.  That seemed to do the trick!  He mentioned the 60mg max was not helping his patients so he conferred with other Psych's and they said their patients did well with taking 2 of the 60mg Cymbalta's.  In addition, I take Clonazepam 1mg after work and 2 mg at night for teeth grinding.  If I son't have it at night I WON'T sleep.  So be careful.  It's like Xanax but last longer and the effect comes on much slower than Xanax.  Good Luck with your depression.  Remember, it's a brain chemical imbalance, NOT YOU!  I got it from my father's side of the family.  He's depressed all the time and won't take anything just like his father and his father's father committed suicide.  So...it's not a weakness, it's a disease.  Remember that!
God Bless you all!"

Unlike Zoloft, which I took several years ago, I haven't experienced the sexual side effects I had then.  I feel like a new person; depression gone, no longer chronically achy and fatigued.  I would recommend.

I am 20 years old and have been struggling with depression, generlized axiety, and ADD. I have been on different medications for 3 years. I've been on pretty much every anti-depressant. I know regret my decision to take cymbalta. I thought this would be the last trial of anti-d's. My previous medications weren't allowing me to reach my potential, but have never had symptoms like Cymbalta. I am on 90 mg of Cymbalta everyday for over 8 months. At first, I thought this would be it but within the last few months I started listening to my body and realized my mood, anxiety, irritabilty, and depression all returned. As well as, other side effects. I knew cymbalta just wasnt the answer and didnt refill my prescription. Although my doctor warned me of the withdrawl from cymbalta and I had no idea it would be the worst feeling of my life. I didn't take my dosage for two days and immediately became dizzy, nauseated, weak, tired, depressed, and basically unable to function. My doctor told me to get back on it and gave me samples for the time being. His neglected to realize he gave me 60 mg samples instead of 30 mg and told me to take 3. I was so completely out of it that I took three. I woke up from a nap and started vomitting and only then did I figure out I had ODed on cymbalta, which didn't help my withdrawl. I have never felt this way before, i thought i was going to die. I told my doctor that i was uncomfortable taking cymbalta and realized it wasnt working anymore. The doctor still has me on 90 mg a day and I want to get off. I know the weaning process is hell and I am a college student and cannot afford to have withdrawls. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know.

In Sept. of 2005, I was hospitalized and taking many drugs to control my condition.  Trying to find another drug to compliment my regime was difficult, but my hospital assigned psychiatrist asked me to try Cymbalta.  I have difficulty with many drugs (side effects), but I was so happy when the doctor gave me Cymbalta!!  It gave me my life back!!!  The hovering blackness disapated and I felt alive again.  Thank God for Cymbalta.  Very, very few side effects.  It's been two (2) years now and I am still taking Cymbalta.  My condition has deteriorated (I am now on Social Security Disability) but Cymbalta will remain a stable of my ""cocktail"" of drugs. It still gives me the great stablizing I need.  

My only concern is that they don't provide Cymbalta in liquid form.  I have had a gastric bypass and can now take the capsules, but I will soon be having a revision to my bypass and would need a liquid since I won't be able to swallow the capsules.  I'm hoping I will be able to break open the capsules and take with applesauce or something soft.

Try Cymbalta if it is recommended to you...it will give you your life back!

Good luck... "

In the beginning things seemed to be progressing decently but they have steadily declined ever since though my dosage is constantly increased.  The drug isn't difficult so much to take.  I'm disgruntled and say it's hard to use because of the stupid way they've got me set up on it.  I'm at 180mg a day: 120 in the morning and 60 at night.  It would have been much easier to give me a huge bottle of 60mg'ers and take 2 in the morning... but, NO.  So now, for bacially one prescribed drug I have two separate prescriptions: 120mg and 60mg: paying twice for what I should only have to pay once.  Ripoff!

At this point I'd rather go back to my old AD, Celexa.  No, that didn't work either (obvious due the change to Cymbalta) but at least I didn't have the dosage/prescription hassle.

It may, or may not, have also contributed to a definitive spike in my anxiety, psychosis, and paranoia.  As the Cymbalta increased, Seroquel also became necessary to take (yet another drug that also isn't working... got a post there too).

Many times I feel like I'd rather just not have any at all.  Sure, nothing would be better but at this point I wouldn't be any worse off.  And at the very least I'd not be paying for overpriced medication that hasn't done anything more than a glass of water can do!"

Then I started with 20 mgs Cymbalta for 2 weeks and I'm on my 3 day of 30 mgs. The last month has been trying to say the least

4741$Major Depressive Disorder$10/1/2007 6:43:40 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$By being placed on Cymbalta, I have felt incredibly different. For a time, I had a hard time even getting out of bed and cried every day--especially at night. It's been about 5 weeks since starting the medication and I feel great and want to be with people in public places now. As before, I didn't want to speak to anyone--not even my family. So, I have a smile on my face now. I have to admit, I noticed the problem when I was crying for no reason and becoming angry a while back. So, I went to my family physician and he recommended the drug---much thanks to him and even myself for even taking a step into the doctor's office in the first place. Who knows where I would be. Thank you Cymbalta! I am even more focused and happier at work. Everyone around me has noticed the change in me in a positive way.

For the drugs that did work, their success did not last for more than 9 months. With Cymbalta, I have been able to remain on it for over a year without it 'no longer working'. If you are just beginning ANY depression medication make sure to tell your doctor if you still don't feel better. It may not be the right medication for you. I know! I've been through several!

4759$Major Depressive Disorder$9/25/2007 11:36:27 AM$Reviewer: Taximan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years$3$3$5$Cymbalta has been fairly well effective at alleviating my suicidal feelings. It has been even more effective at relieving my back pain. (The back pain is either Arthritis or degenerative disc disease)  However, Cymbalta has made me so sleepy I am sleeping the day away 2 and 3 times a week. All this and I only take 15 - 20 mg. If not for all this sleepiness I would have rated it at 5 stars. But this sleepiness is a real problem. A problem that so far, has no solution.

4763$Major Depressive Disorder$9/24/2007 10:52:52 PM$Reviewer: Brandy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I'm a 30 year old female and started with 30 mg. The pain from arthritus, bone spur in my heel, and constant jaw pain was releived within first 3 days of beginning Cymbalta.  Some loss of appetite.  Major help with anger and mood swings.  Can think clearly now.   Mind isn't racing like it was. No trouble sleeping, nausea, no bad side effects.  Have been on 30 mg for 6 weeks.  Requesting to move up to 40mg if possible because pain relief has subsided with continued use.  Love this medicine.  Best thing I have ever taken.  Recommended it to several family members with depression or pain. 
4764$Major Depressive Disorder$9/24/2007 7:44:29 PM$Reviewer: $5$4$5$i have gone back on it a couple of times for my depression.  it makes me feel almost manic, but i'm trying a lower dose this time.  it has worked well besides that one side effect.  i would recommend it to people who are easily sensitive to medications and can have easy allergic reactions like me.  i have not had a reaction severe enough to stop it.  i also recommend it to people who have found other meds to be ineffective.  this has been the only med that has helped my depression.

I feel that it did help more for this issue than a lot of other meds I have been on,(I am very med resistant), but it wasn't the best I've been on. It didn't really have a significant impact on my suicidal ideations, or self harm though. Around the first 2 weeks I was taking this medication, I was hospitilized for major depression, and Dellusional/Disassociative thinking.
