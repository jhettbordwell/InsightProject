30$Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/3/2015 8:47:13 AM$Reviewer: temporal lobe adhd, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"All the other ADHD meds haven't worked and neither does this one. The Integrated Visual Auditory continuous performance test rated my ADHD so severe that I tested several decimal places below the 1 percentile. And I've tried all the on and off label drugs. Amphetamine Salts works the best and that is still not worth the dry mouth unless I'm behind on sleep.

I've been on Desipramine for 5 weeks now starting at 75 and now up to 225. It gives me in order of severity: severe dry mouth (like all the others), somnolence(strong desire for sleep), sinus congestion, lowers my energy and motivation, and gave me a near death experience when I took desipramine 150, amphetamine salts IR 30 and propranolol IR 80 all at the same time without much breakfast or drink. Instead of helping get things done, it's making it even harder to get things done. All 3 use the same 2D6 enzyme and amphetamine and desipramine enhance each other which gave me several of desipramine's side effects. Caffeine works better than amphetamine for not interacting with desipramine, but still increases the dry mouth terribly. Looks like a cholinergic deficit but Galantamine didn't do anything. Pilocarpine relieves my dry mouth but doesn't solve the core attention problem."
