4$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$6/12/2014 1:16:09 PM$Reviewer: craigzworld, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"I have been taking this drug since January of 2013. It calms my headaches and dizziness resulting from a Traumatic Brain Injury. Pamelor also works well with keeping my mood swings in check. I started out at 25 milligrams nightly and then  increased it to 50 milligrams and now I am at 75 milligrams daily. 
The major negatives with this drug is a higher heart rate, hair loss - could be from my age mid 50's, and about a 15% weight gain which is extremely difficult to work its way off."

I was going through a terribly stressful time at work and noticed a HUGE difference in just a few days on 30 mg.  I also began sleeping better than I have in years!  The dry mouth was difficult for me, but worth it.  I also had some constipation, but nothing that some stool softeners couldn't help.  After I got through the worst time I decreased to 20 mg/day, and have settled there nicely.  The dry mouth is no longer a problem and I am still sleeping great and emotionally stable.

Had to go through a whole host of other depression Rx's before finding this one to be effective.  There are side effects: dry mouth; ringing in the ears; weight gain--which has to be attended to; but it is the only Rx that has worked for me.  So the trade off in terms of putting up with the side effects has been worth it. I use Biotene mouthwask to handle the dry mouth--it's effective. I have to watch my diet but my determination does me well.

27$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$8/24/2011 12:29:50 AM$Reviewer: SKNY, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"I am taking this medication for fybromyalgia pain, and for associated sleep problems. Over about a year, I worked up to 40mg a day (taken at night). I've now started to take 50mg a day. Early on, last year, I had dry mouth and was sleepy. Constipation has been an ongoing issue, but is easily addressed with a daily dose of fiber supplements. I think there's been some impact on my weight, but not terrible. The more serious side effect was that at the very beginning, the med made me feel more depressed, sometimes even somewhat suicidal, but I decided to stick it out for a while, and I'm glad I did, because the side-effects subsided after about a 4-6 weeks. The very big upside is that my pain was significantly diminished, and my sleep got much better (I hadn't had a decent night's sleep in 5 years without Ambien, and I do react well to sleeping meds). I still sometimes get headaches from neck pain, but my MD suggested an Ativan (Lorazepam), which I take occasionally, and which usually helps. Over time the Pamelor also had a positive effect on my feelings of depression, and my fibro-related fogginess lifted quite a bit. 

I have had some recent resurgence in pain, so my GP suggested  that extra 10mg a day to go up to 50mg (something my neurologist had recommended many months ago). I started in the past week, and am noticing renewed side-effects--the dry mouth (and bad taste in my mouth) is back, I'm sleeping long, long hours (12-14), and the constipation is worse.  BUT I'm hoping that, since these eventually eased before, they will again. Overall so far, I think Nortiptyline (generic Pamelor) has been a very successful treatment for me. "

Each pill is 10mg cap. At first I took one pill, then my MD asked me to take 2 pills. One pill mostly stopped all the crying and sadness I had, but was not able to fall asleep fast enough. Then, my MD asked me to take 2 pills, I did not do well since I really was not able to sleep at all. Now, my migraine,neck pain and crying are starting again. My MD asked me to take 2 pills again and add Tylenol pM for night time. I am not really sure whats going on. My migraines are active twice a month for at least 4 to 5 days each. For the migraines I use Relpax, but I need this medication constantly within my reach. Overall, I do not feel that Pamelor will help me entirely.

33$Condition: Depression$5/30/2011 10:39:34 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$3$This medication took a couple of weeks to start working. After about 2 weeks I could tell a difference in myself. I was happier and felt less anxious. My family noticed a difference in me too (I wasn't soo gloomy and grouchy anymore.) For the most part I would say Pamelor has helped me. My only issue is that I sometimes forget to take it. I take it once daily at bedtime. If I'm really tired when going to bed, I sometimes forget to take it. I end up missing that dose because I don't want to take it the next morning (because I'm concerned that it might be too close to the next dose.) When I miss 1 or 2 doses, I end up feeling depressed, angry, and anxious all over again. This has just happened to me, so today I set an alarm in my phone to remind me to take it every night. All-in-All, As long as I keep up with it, It gives me great results!

Pamelor- ask your doc for Imipramine! It's the best.It has few of the side effects of the others.I've been on many TCA's, and 
Imipramine leaves Nortriptyline and the others
(like elavil)in the shade! You will not wake
up groggy,it does not cause palpitations,you
will not be dizzy,etc.This is the stuff! It also causes more mood elevation than the others.I wake up every morning downright
euphoric(happy,content)! It works for the same
things pamelor and elevil are used for(except
not the best for sleep-only causes mild drowsiness)Try it.you wont go back.Small
doses are very effective.Difficulty urinating
goes away after awhile.Makes skin pleasantly
tingle-becomes less with time."

I am 16 year old female. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I felt pretty good for about three months with no problems. I was first taking 10mg a day, then upped it to 20mg.I smoked once and had a reaction, but didn't think much of it. I took Excedrin for a headache which has caffeiene and had another reaction. My heartbeat was nearly 200 and could not see straight, dizzy, talking to myself. Rode in ambulance so out of it. They diagnosed me with SVT (heart condition) which was caused with from the Nortiptaline. I quit cold turkey and was completely insane for two weeks. Hearing voices in my head, wanting to die, extremely sleepy, did nothing by lay in my bed.I am still suicidal and it has nearly been a month. I'm surprised I have made it through everything. I prayed every night for God to just keep me alive through all the pain and suffering. I know have extreme anxiety(chest pain, cannot see clearly, feel like I can't breath, very snappy with people) and before taking Pamelor I was a pretty happy person. I told myself I would never take drugs again, but am now surrendering to Zoloft. I can't live like this.

I've had RA for 19 years, depression for 19 years, menopause going on 5 years and fatigue since I can't remember when.  I have been on every medication possible for above issues.  After reading these reviews, I thought I would give Pamelor another try.  I only took it for about a week and got so frustrated because I did not experience any positive results. Actually, NO RESULTS at all. I guess that is the ""mania/anger feelings"" that come along with depression.  Thanks to all of you who took time out to write a review whether positive or negative.  It made me feel I need to give Pamelor time to adjust to my body.  Since, the doctor has prescribed adderall which has relieved only the fatigue issues.  Wish I could find something that would help with at least one more of my ailments.  If anyone has any ideas, please please please advise.

It took about 2-3 weeks to work, but I haven't had a headache in 8 days now!  I am definitely pleased with this aspect. The only side effect I've experienced that I don't like is constipation, but I have IBS with constipation anyway.  I take Metamucil, stool softener, eat prunes and apples to combat that.  I do sleep longer and feel just a tad sluggish in the morning but it dissipates quickly enough.  I dream a lot, though, not bad dreams, just busy. I wake frequently but have no trouble falling back asleep.  I am menopausal, too, so part of my sleep disruption is due to that.  Overall I'm happy with Pamelor.

When I changed neurologist I had to do a stress test for the heart because the two meds together caused heart flutters. So I was taken off the pamelor then all H… broke loose. I became depressed and developed IBS and my migraines came more often and more painful. I was in a downward spiral for two years. My life is getting back to normal but I am not happy about post pamelor conditions.  I now take prozac which helped ease up the post symptoms.

Pain level in butt & legs up to an 8 of 10 at times,sitting was excruciating and I couldn't even stand the bedsheet to touch my left leg/foot. I had a level of 5-6 often.

At first on this drug, had heart palpitations, crazy non-stop dreaming except to jerk awake, diarrhea, nausea, eye twitches. started at 10mg a day. Side affects x 4weeks, now none! I've been on it 8 months and it doesn't even really make me sleepy (bummer). Now taking 30mg a day two pills in pm, one in am.

On pain-free days I think drug is great.  On bad days,not so great! But bad days now around level 4-5 w/lots of 0-2 days now. I keep up exercise, home physical therapy, ice, stretching, & rest & steroid shots though, it's a multi-pronged approach.

I advise to titrate up really slowly,less of a shock that way. I'm trying to avoid having to take narcotics, and trying to avoid Neurontin; afraid I'll want to stab somebody with a salad fork on that stuff after reading it's reviews. (But,local pharmacist says Neurontin mostly just makes you sleepy and someday I may have no choice) Right now,this is helping some, not interfering with my life and I can still titrate up to 50mg a day if needed.

Good luck to all of us nerve pain sufferers-many of us look & try to act quite normal, but spend a lot of time in misery."

For this I took another prescription drug. However after my doctor added another med, it resulted in nearly 100% reduction of migraines. I have not had a ""real"" migraine since I don't know when!
I sometimes have drowsiness when awaking in the morning on occasions. Sometimes I go through weak periods where sitting becomes a necessity, and standing is not an option. Because I feel that I will collapse otherwise.
Over all I have had great success with this med, and it seems like the weight problem stopped when I went on the second med.  
I write this positive report because all of the reports I read were negative. Of course my problem may not have been as severe as those whose woes I read.
I've been to the well known migraine clinic North of Chicago, to a doctor in Elkhart, IN (whom I heard had success with migraines), then to this neurologist. "

One night I discovered that taking Pamelor (nortryptaline) with just one can of beer allowed me to get a nice refreshing sleep without DT's. Eventually I was able to quit drinking altogether. Granted, nortryptaline isn't indicated for that use specfically, but that's what it did for me. It's very mild, it's relaxing and effective for many things.

Effectiveness: it worked a little for the pain (severe migraines)

Satisfaction: Would definitely NOT recommend this drug. The side effects were horrible. I had hallucinations about a week after starting to use it. I also started to have a hard time getting back to a normal sleeping schedule while using it. My anxiety was higher than normal. And I'm very sorry to say that after 2-3 weeks I started having suicidal thought, had a seizure, and then had to be rushed to the hospital in intensive care for 3 days.

The medication did help with the pain, but the side effects were far too much for my body to handle. It also didn't help that I didn't have an attentive doctor. I certainly don't think everyone will react this badly from the medication, but I highly advise that you have a doctor that doesn't underplay the possible side effects if you choose to use it. If you are using it and start to have odd side effects after a week please report them immediately and don't think they'll get better (for me they just got worse). And if you're doctor thinks you're overreacting, seek a second opinion or go to the hospital. I wish I was never given this drug, it nearly killed me."

With each day, month, year my migraines got better and better until I was migraine free by the 2nd year I was on this medication. Rarely do I have a migraine let alone a headache now. I believe that it has also helped my other chronic pains as well. I may have gained some weight and have chronic constipation as side effects of this medication, but it is well worth it!

I now require 10-12 hours of sleep.  I can fall asleep at any time.  I have no motivation to do anything fun or entertaining.  The first week, I was severely depressed.  The second week, my need for sleep went from 10-12 hours to 8-10 hours.  It slightly increases anxiety.  It does not improve concentration.  No one has mentioned that it increased depression and anxiety while decreased motivation and never touched concentration, so I thought I was going crazy or maybe just having a rough personal life.  This is week 3 now, and I still have yet to see this medication benefit my life.  I also find it strange that people take it for neuropathic pain, because I have had one hell of an eye ache since I've started.  There is a warm sensation... which is a benign side effect.  The only other side effect I have experienced is nightmares and vivid dreams.  The worst side effect has been the depression, and the most annoying has been the increased need for sleep.  I may have gained some weight from an increase in desire for sweets.  For some, this would be a deal-breaker, but if I can sit down and do something productive for once, it would all be worth it.  My form of ADHD is not untreatable... other medications with high side effect profiles have worked.  I have yet to try Selegiline, and recent studies are looking positive for the treatment for Adult ADHD.  I will move on from this drug once the pills run out and still have found no obvious benefit.  I have yet to find someone with only ADHD-PI benefit from this drug.  I honestly don't see how it would benefit those suffering from depression, I have had quite a miserable experience so far, especially that first week.

It's been 9 months of continual use and I'm still having the 'ice picks'.

305$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$5/15/2011 5:42:20 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$2$Chronic migraines, chronic pain, and depression. After reading others symptoms, I was apprehensive about taking this drug. I was unable to work or do much of anything between the constant pain and provoking migraines so severe they would require hospitalization only after I had vomited everything possible to allow travel. i could often not slow or stop them with the best migraine meds, and they would continue for days or even weeks right prior to starting nortriptyline. The side affects can be intense at first. I was started at 40mg 1 hour before bed. Each week I increased 20 or 25mg til i was at 100mg. My miraines were gone (now only minor headaches controlled with a couple advil) and i was back at work 4-6 hours a day. However, the side effects were unbearable, I thought I would have to stop. I didnt even know who I was or what I was doing, thoughts raced, I had to hang on to things often until my balance was stable, my stomach was beyond constipation, mouth was so dry i had to keep water and gum close day and night, and it took all of my focus to drive or try to communicate with anyone. I truly felt like I was losing my mind at this dose. My dose dropped to 75mg and within a few days everything came back into focus. Every symptom lessened to an acceptable level and I was still working most of the time and free of migraines. The only problem now was I had severe depression from the injury i had been trying to recover from for over four years. So under doctors care I slowly incresed dose 25mg. to where I am now at 150mg. (This medicine treats depression at 100mg and higher dose) With each increase side effects worsen temporarely but managabley, and you can always decrease dose until you can manage. Work with your Dr. You will probably also need to see a physcologist to help you stay grounded if you are prescribed higher doses. I am now working full time and still able to enjoy a few light activities. A good diet and exercise are essential. May the Lord bless you!

I couldn't tell any difference for sure, it was subtle, but the drug made my throat way down my neck sore inside. I stopped taking it, sore throat went away. I started it up again, sore throat came back. Sore throat is what I'd call moderate, but was pretty uncomfortable. Doctor said to quit taking the med due to the sore throat, that the sore throat could indicate something (very complex) and that I should stop taking the med. After I stopped taking it a few days later the tinnitus got noticeably worse. At this point I realized the drug had worked some and had made the symptoms less severe, but it was no cure. Sore throat was slower to go away the 2nd time coming off the drug. Sore throat is not a normal one caused by a virus etc., it's deep down in my throat. Also felt irritable and tired after coming off the drug which is somewhat odd considering the extremely small dosage of 10mg. Perhaps it was just my annoyance at it not working better for me.

My does started from 1 pill and progressed to a final dosage of 3 pills at bedtime. My migraine frequency went from 8-10 per month to 3-4 per month. It was a blessing however, it has caused severe gastro problems for me. I have tried several OTC remedies. So now after 3 months of use, my doc is pulling me off and trying something different. The side effects outweighed the pro's in this case but I encourage any migraine sufferers to try the Topimax/nortriptilyne combo. Perhaps you won't have the side effects I had to the extent that I am having them. I also had a huge decrease of libido and have gained a few pounds. It figures that I find a med that helps my core problem and causes many other problems :(

For 25+ yrs suffered nerve pain from neck down back & left leg to big toe after a car accident. Tried many meds for pain all made my feel wrong in one way or another. Finally Dx'd as sciatica.  I can now tolerate being touched & experience much lower pain levels. Good as anti-depressant also as in last 4 mths I have been Dx'd w/ COPD, obstructive sleep apnea & breast cancer but I still find joy everyday. Helps w/ lymph node removal pain in arm (they cut the nerve bundle when remove lymph nodes).  Worked my way up to 50mgs nightly - took appx 6 wks to take affect.  Missed a few nights & nerve pain returned.  Weight gain? Yes.  Dry mouth?  Not from this med, but there's nothing like sleeping w/ a face mask blowing 22mph into mouth for sleep apnea to make your mouth dry (even w/ a humidifier). Mood swings? Less than before I started taking. Constipation? I try to eat yogurt every day as a sweet snack.

I have run the gammet of drugs over the years to no avail.  However, I was able to control my moods until a divorce.  
At the age of 29 I had my first majoy episode,, and was treated with drugs and therapy for a short period.  A new wife helped greatly for a while.  I used alcohol to treat myself for many years, but graduated from AA and the depression came back
Due to a turn coat friend, I had my third episode sober, smoking free, and off drugs.  I for the first time could not take life as it was and took an overdose of Xanax.  Luckyly it was discovered immediatedly and I was cleaned out and sent to lock up for 7 days observation.  I came out taking 300mg of Wellbutrin for 3 years and 1 year of therapy.  However, the occassional thought of suicide  still occured.  My doctor put me on 50mg of Nortriptyline at night along with Clomapin for anxiety and 300 mg of Wellbutrin during the day.  I now sleep through the night and am a little weak in the mornings with a dry mouth, but it get better as the day goes by.  I solved the constipation by taking 3-4 magnesiom tables daily.  My suicidal thought are under control as I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't have that many days left on earth and I want to finally enjoy them.  A little dry mouth or constipation I can handle, suicide I cannot handle.  It is a premanent solution for a temperary problem.  "

I was taking 10-15 OTC pain relievers a day for the regular headaches and would have to go to the emergency room once a month or so to get an injection for migraines that would knock me out till the next day. I'm down to about 2-3 regular headaches a week and I'll still get a migraine about every 2-3 months (and I have Relpax for that now). So for what it was prescribed to do, it has done great. The side effects I have noticed are trouble sleeping, bouts of dizziness and decreased sex drive. I was also diagnosed with depression in '95 and have been on several different meds over the years, but have not been on anything for that for about 4 years. Since I started the Nortriptyline over a year ago, 50 mg at night, my depression is actually coming back. I just read today that Nortriptyline is also used for depression, but up to 3 times the dosage I am taking for headaches. I will be talking with my DR about my options going forward since my depression (bad enough that I feel I need to go back on a medication)is now a reoccurring thing that is coming around way more often than I (and my family) am comfortable with.
But for the headaches, this has been the only med that gives me this much relief.          "

It did help me function b/c I had depression and anxiety and insomnia. I was able to go to college and get a job but after many years on it I developed problems.  I now have gastroparesis and IBS. Most DR.s say this med helps the stomach but slows the intestines but since I've been off it 5 months all of my problesm with digestion  from swallowing all the way down to eliminating have improved. I had also developed reoccurring infections in my lymph nodes and exhaustion to the point of sleeping 17 hours a day. This too has improved but not gone away since being off the med. I'm guessing that my body has changed as I have aged making this not the right medicine for me anymore but it helped for many years. When I first started it it was a relief to me not to wake in the middle of the night in full blown panic attacks, and to feel calmer. No other med has worked as well but I have to say goodbye b/c the infections in my lymph nodes and the exhaustion is too much to deal with. Some people say they felt foggy on it but I never did. I felt electrified without it, and normal with it. It calmed me, and in emergencies, it really stopped full blown panic attacks. Dr.s say I shouldn't take it as it is dangerous but what antidepressant isn't? Am considering Lexapro now, but after being drug free for 5 months I feel physically healthier and am wondering if the trade off is worth it. I am depressed. I have no....no desire to do anything. No drive. No hope. No pill is magic but what if it helps? No way to know but to try. As long as it isn't liver/heart/kidney/nervous system damaging I guess comming off would stop the negative effects. Plus I'm waiting to completely come back from the Cymbalta which nearly killed me.

436$Condition: Depression$7/18/2009 9:18:35 PM$Reviewer: ddprib, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$The primary reason of me taking this is for sleep deprivation with a secondary reason for depression.  Prior to this medication, I was taking (3) 50mg tablets of amitriptyline at dinner as they take quite awhile to take effect. Amitriptyline definately works better than the Nortriptyline for sleep if taken at dinner time and not bedtime. I take Zanax 3 times a day also, so I don't know if they cause anxiety.  I had to get off of the Amitriptyline because it makes it very difficult to get up at an early time like going to work.  The Amitriptyline started making me listless and depressed during the day also and then my Dr. put me on Nortriptyline as it makes it easier on getting up in the morning and having more energy during the day.  I would advise anybody taking Nortriptyline or Amitriptyline to read all the precautions here on WebMD as it gave me alot of information of all of the side effects along with other health problems you may have as Diabeties, etc.that is listed and let your Dr. know about many other body issues you may have including Diabeties, etc. I am more well of on Nortriptyline than Amitriptyline, unless you just want to sleep night and day.  In closing, I just urge you to read all of the information they provide here on WebMD. About 90% of the info. provided between the 2 medicines is the same.

It worked immediately (at 25 mg) on my migraine.  When I escalated to 50mg, I began having side effects:very dry mouth, heart rate above 100, and constipation. Two weeks ago, I was stepped down to 25mg/day, and the side efects have almost disappeared.  If the 25mg dose can continue to stave off my migraines, I'll be a very happy camper.

I've been on it for three years.  Recently I have had trouble with food lodging in my lower esophagus and causing a lot of pain until it finally goes down into my stomach.  My doctor says the drug can cause the esophagus muscles to become sluggish. It's a considerable problem for me, but I have taken many medications and none work as well for the depression.

The first few days I was using it I felt very tired in the afternoon, But after about a week it really started to help lessen the symtoms of my condition. Less anxiety, no aches or pain, better consentraction/focus, more energy, happier, less irratable, more ease falling asleep, and I was do much better in school. When ever I exercise or reading I felt a pleasant tingling sensation, a side effect but an enjoyable one. Exercising also increased the benefits of the medication. The side effects usually were not to bad, dry mouth and strange taste in the morning, dizziness after standing up, faster heartbeat, and slightly high blood pressure. I never had any sexual problems, but I have noticed a lowered sex drive. About 1 to 2 times a month at night after taking my dose I start to have what I would describe as ""closed-eye visuals"", very strange and sometimes scary, I also sometimes wake in the night and when I started to fall back asleep after a brief amount of time I would feel an unpleasant strong ""prickly"" felling in my brain, followed by the strange dreams, which seemed overpowering as if I was still awake. Overall for me the benefits outweighted the side effects."

She was on it for a little over a year. She committed suicide while on this medication...ironically...this medication is what she used for the suicide...she took an intentional overdose. I suppose that everyone is different and responds different to medication but I have read some other's comments about extreme mood changes in their loved ones. Then there are other reports stating everything is working great. I have always found it strange that the very medications they use to treat depression can actually make it worse. Most antidepressants now actually have warnings about causing a deeper level of depression and actually causing thoughts of suicide in some people...even in those who have never considered suicide previously. Doesn't make sense to me...but I am not a doctor nor a chemist who make these drugs. Hooray to those of you that find relief in this medicine and I have deep sympathies for those who have seen themselves or their loved ones go further downhill. It is rough to witness someone's pain and suffering like that.

I started with Neurontin, Lyrica, and Cymbalta. None of them helped the pain. I had some success with amitryptyline for about 3 months 2 years ago. It gradually quit working. I tried to avoid taking opiates but had no other options. I started with 5mg hydrocodone 4/day. Because of constipation the neurologist switched to oxycodone. He upped the dosage to 7.5mg 4/day then 10mg 4/day. This helped a lot for about a year. I then gradually felt the pain coming back. I switched neurologists for another opinion. She lowered the oxycodone to 7.5 and I started with 25mg/day Nortriptyline then 50mg and finally 75mg. After a week at 75 mg I began having trouble urinating. It got so bad that I couldn't go for almost 8 hours. I'm back to my primary care tomorrow to talk about other alternative treatments. I have seen a pain mgmt specialist he wants me to see another neuro and possibly get setup with the Spinal Cord Stimulation unit. I'm fearful of that until someone convinces me that it is safe. I am so tired of all this. I have been to over a dozen doctors and none seem to understand or care about chronic pain.

But I've been researching this medication more and have noticed that my headaches could possibly be related to depression (not sure). I've noticed that I'm a lot happier now, and just today (after about 2 weeks of being on it) I didn't get a headache all day. So I finally feel that the medication is taking effect. My doctor also had put me on the lowest dose possible, and after my MRI's and MRA's my headaches were still unknown and the medication wasn't working with only one pill a night. So she upped my dose to 2 pills a night and it's been working amazingly.

Have taken SSRIs, and an MAOI with little success. This medication has increased my fatigue, so that I'm sleeping 12+ hrs a day, and still feel tired. Instead of solely decreasing the depression, the med seems to numb all of my emotional responses.  I am less tearful but more apathetic. Also I've noticed increased irritability. 

I have had ongoing headaches seemingly related to the depression and tension, and haven't noticed any difference in the severity or frequency of those headaches since taking the medication. 

I've had extremely dry mouth and increased thirst since starting the medication, along with increased appetite.  I've only been on the medication a short period of time (two weeks), but I think that my doctor will probably take me off the medication when I go back for my next appointment. "

I was at the end of my rope.  The only way I could stop the pain was to go to the hosiptal and get a Compazine i.v.  I'd go home and sleep it off and a day later the headache would come back.  If I weren't a mother I would have considered ending it. Absolutely nothing else worked. When I started taking this drug I had very strange dreams at first. You might want to start on a low dose and work up to a higher dosage.  This medication helped my headaches within 24 hours. If you are desparate enough you will try anything and the dreams were weird, but I'd choose them over the pain anytime.  The dreams went away and now if I miss the medication for 2 or more days the headaches come back.  It is a lifesaver.

When I stopped the drugs, I started having brain freezes. little shocks evry time I moved my eyes or head. Sometimes 40-50 a minute. They lasted for about 6 weeks. Tey didn't stop until my Dr. (a new Dr.) had me start Nortriptyline. He started me on 10mgs, which is a very, very small dose. The brain freezes stopped right away. It took a little time and I have worked up to 50 mgs. I am not depressed hardly at all anymore. My anxiety is still there but is managable. My outlook on things is a lot better.

My Pain Managment Doctor is also having me take 5000 IU D-3 per day.  You can google NOW FOODS and buy them cheap, plus they are extremely small.  Sugar will increase pain.
