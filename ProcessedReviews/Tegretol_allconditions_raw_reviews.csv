3$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$5/15/2019 12:09:55 PM$Reviewer: Lara, 65-74 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$"My Trigeminal Neuralgia started in 1996 as the result of a severe undiscovered infection caused by a corroded silver pin used during a root canal when I was 11 years old.(I am a language teacher and singer, and went through some excruciating days, using ice packs, heat, etc.)  Doctors just kept wanting to give me pain killers and all the dentists I went to, kept telling me they could see nothing wrong.  Meanwhile, the abscess was eating through my jaw bone.  After it was finally big enough to be discovered, about 10 - 12 months,(and x-rays got more precise) and the abscess was taken care of,  it went away for 20 years. I then moved and found a new dentist who did NOT LISTEN to me!  He made a night guard for the wrong area of my mouth and the TGN started again. Had two very severe attacks in 2017 and I have been using  Carbamazepine as needed when I feel twinges.  I have been very lucky.  I want to let you know about an organic essential that was introduced to me in a health/natural store. You roll it on the outside of the area causing the pain and I have found it to be extremely helpful.  It is VERIDITAS by Pranarom and is called: Just Plain Relief.  Yes,  that's  Plain (with an ""l"").  I take two 200 mg grams of Carba... twice a day and if I do get a spasm, I roll this on.  I find it very soothing and considerably helpful.  I certainly hope you find the right combination that will work for you.   "

5$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$3/18/2019 3:30:37 PM$Reviewer: Jeanne, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have used carbamazepine ER for 30 years and it has worked well except for 2 seizures 14 years ago which I attribute to 'the change.'  I had to increase my doseage to a total of 1100mg/day, split between morning and evening.  I have had some memory loss, but that started just after my first seizure when I was 35 and was told it was brain disintegration (can't think of the right word).  Finding words is sometimes difficult but can't know if it is the medication or the state of my brain after the seizure.  Every 3 weeks or so I have an aura where I can't follow conversation or process information well.  It ends with a headache so I know it is going away.  If often lasts all day and I may wake up with it.  I don't know if that means less control by the medicine or not.  At least I have not had any seizures for 14 years.  The only really BAD thing is that this drug is part of a class of AEDs that cause bone loss.  After all of these years, I have severe osteoporosis and broke my arm after a bad fall.  The surgeon had to pin everything together and said my bones were weaker than he had anticipated.  Considering I may have at least another 20 years to go, I am considering changing to another drug that does not affect bones.  However, all of the reviews I have read on those (lamotrigine, vimpat, topirimate and leviracetam) are very scary.  Taking Fosamax for my bones is not the answer, apparently, since I had been doing that for a number of years.  Anyone with any info on this is very appreciated.  I suggest all long term users to have bone density tests every 2 years - even the men.

7$Condition: Nerve Pain$1/8/2019 8:45:46 AM$Reviewer: Pinky1234, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$For a year I have been treated for TMJ but I have such intense pain that I would rather die, that my husband made me go to our family doc about it. He said he thinks its Trigeminal Neuralgia, sent me to ENT, who agreed, he sent me for MRI and to Neurologist, who also agrees it Tri Neuralgia. Now on Carbamazepine, which seems to help but only been on it for 3 weeks. Neuro wants to change that to gabapentin, but side effect reviews for that scare me. I haven't had any pain since 1-2-19, so hoping its working. My pain comes whenever, night or day and lasts anywhere from 1/2 hr to 2 hrs. Would rather go thru childbirth with no assistance than this pain. I'm hoping someone finds an effective cure for this because it's ruining my life-afraid to do anything or go anywhere because it starts out of nowhere. Don't want to embarass myself or my husband. So glad he loves me and helps me through the pain, just by holding me and letting me cry on his shoulder til it passes. Sorry but can't help but cry--don't want to but automatically tears come.

It was like my own body was electrocuting itself. Carbemazepine at 200mg a day did nothing.  It took 400 mg a day to finally get it under control. I am going to a Dentist today in hopes of extracting a tooth that may be pressing on the nerve.  I am not looking forward to the surgery options. All in all, the Carbemazepine did save my sanity for the time I have been on it. I could actually function as a normal human being this last week. God Bless (or whatever higher being you believe in) if this is happening to you. I would not wish this on my worst enemy.  The medication did work wonders though, but, it is not a final solution.

Didnâ??t work. 8 yrs later had the Gamma Knife because i was having a lot of pain even with the meds. So I took the chance and it worked. I have been pain free for 1 yr and 2 months. The medicine did work gor me. And the highest dosage I took was 1000 msg per day. But like all medicines there are side affects. I was feeling depression and at times suicidial but I never attempted to do anything so drastic. Because the pain of TN has been know to cause that. I never gave up and I hope this helps someone and gives them hope. I will try gamma knife again if the pain comes back. But the meds did work. 
11$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$4/26/2018 10:09:12 PM$Reviewer: mnicholson123, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$2$I am 28yrs old and have had constant face pain for four years. Just recently acquired insurance, and went to the local urgent Care. Doc there tells me go see a neurologist. Neurologist says you have trigeminal neuralgia and gives me 600mg of gabapentin 3 times a day, and 200mg of carbamazepine 3 times a day. The pain gets dulled away, but some days I can feel it leak through the medication and ruin my life. My wife hates those days. I went to an ENT and he says get your septum fixed and it'll help. I get the surgery. The pain is still there. Can anyone out there with trigeminal neuralgia tell me if they have a constant pain all the time like I do? I've had an MRI and a CT scan and they say nothing is wrong, so it must be that nerve. But everyone else seems like their pain comes and goes. Mine is always there.

I had it several years ago and it was just intermittent with no treatment and then it came back 7 months ago and was incredibly painful. Saw a neurologist who started me on 100mg 2x/day and gradually I have increased to 600 mg 2x/day. Each increase in dosage worked for a week so I am keeping my fingers crossed this dosage will work. still feel pain behind my throat  but nothing compared to what I felt before so I am good with it. Have had the loss of words and feeling a bit foggy feeling that others report but trade off feels worth it at the moment. Just praying it continues to be effective.

14$Condition: Nerve Pain$10/17/2016 12:59:22 PM$Reviewer: AMK, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$I have been taking this medication for facial nerve pain, for just over a week.  I was on the meds for 3 days and got the pain no relief from the medication. At midnight I took another half to see if it would do anything, at least make me sleepy, but it didn't.   I can feel the pain wanting to come today my 9th day on it and it feels subdued.  Like I know it's there but it's not made it's full arrival  yet.  One very good side effect I've had is this medication has helped me with my depression.  I used to cry everyday and since I started taking this medication I've stopped and not felt so despondent.  As for physical side effects I've had some drowsiness which seems to be going away and if I bend and stand quickly I get dizzy, but that's all.

OMG the best way I could describe it is like being a depressed zombie. I took it for 17 days. Looking back the only thing I remember is deciding no to take it anymore. It is a horrible medicine that should only be tried as a last resort medicine!! It did nothing for the pain, in fact it might of made it worse! My Dr. never told me its main use is for anticonvulsant & BI-POLAR DISORDER!!! There is a reason why opioids have been around since 3440B.C. Its cause they WORK!

I happened to hear that this medication causes drops in white blood cell levels so, I went to the doc and sure enough, my level was 2.9 vis 4.0-11.0. I was told to go off it immediately (Have to get off slowly) AND RETEST LEVELS ONE WEEK LATER.  I know you have to monitor risk benefit. For me, I get face pain episodes  approx 2 times per requiring me to take 3-6 imitrex during that time.  So, I would rather not take this drug.  I have heard Lyrica is supposed to be good but I am choosing to stop all. The risks of side effects long term is just not worth it to me.

I could not stand a simple hug without pain. I showed my primary care physician how intense the pain was from the right side of my face to my right shoulder and down my right arm. (I didn't swing on him this time.) After a consul with my neurologist I was placed on this drug. So, far there are no side effects. I have talked to my neurologist about increase in the dosage during extreme pain to two pills. Having TIC isn't fun but I'm learning to enjoy certain parts of life; I thought would be lost to me because of this condition. This is now the three drug I've been on because of TIC; I pray there is a surgical solution that may help all of us. I know the pain of washing my face and screaming because one drug didn't work. I know the pain of eating so slowly others worry and wonder about your health. I know the pain of being examine by your doctor and nearly putting him on the floor because he found the source of your pain, twice. I know pain the same doctor felt want he has tried everything he knows to help you and your working with him 100% to put the pain your enduring into your short-term memory. I know the pain of tensing went your hugged by friends and family, because the pain will shot through your face, neck and shoulder like a white hot knife. I would like to feel like I did over five years ago. When dancing Argentine Tango was a simple walk, okay not so simple but a dance I enjoyed. Not, my choosing open embrace because of the pain I have to avoid.                  I will enjoy my life despite TIC and I will fight back. This is my body and I pay the rent; TIC will not kick me out and move in.

The pain was truly intense, only on the right side...I could not touch my scalp (shower water was horribly painful), my right ear had shooting pain into my jaw, right side of my face was numb and slack, and looked like I had a black eye. My gums & teeth on right side hurt, spices (even mustard on my hotdog) hurt!! I truly feared I had a tumor!!  Dr. prescribed Tegretol 100mg 2x day for two days, then increase to 200mg 2x for 2 days...working my way up to 400mg 2x.  On the 3rd day of the meds, I attempted to increase to the 200mg...and it was way too much.  Pain creeps in at the 100mg dose, so we are supplementing with a liquid and increasing it slowly as needed...seems to be working.  I do feel like I'm in a fog, have trouble thinking of words, speaking coherently, making sentences...I fall. I am depressed.  But the meds are helping with the pain...they work well...I just don't like the side effects...I even have to get someone to help my kids with their homework, as I just can't wrap my brain around it, which makes me feel worthless, which adds to the depression.  Have gained weight, which adds to depression. Very tired. Hoping it will only be a 6 month course of meds, hoping no more shingles.

It is also used to relieve one type of nerve pain (trigeminal neuralgia). 
Mine was located just under my molar on the left side of my face.
Ironically, I had just had a dental procedure done to the lower molar on that side of my mouth.
I repeatedly went to my dentist to have the severe pain corrected.
He could find nothing wrong, but gave me Vicodan to relieve the pain.
At first, the Vicodan worked. After 10 to 20 minutes the pain disappeared like the snap of my fingers. I can descibe it no other way.
It worked for a for about 3 hours before the pain returned.
It was not very long, maybe 4 days or so before it stopped working and I had that intense pain again.
I kept adding pain relievers to the vicidan...tylenol, asperin, alieve etc.
Nothing worked.
At one point I took the Vicidan, 3 tablets, 3 asperin, alieve and some percoset given to me by a co-worker all within an hour.
I know that this was dangerous and very very stupid.
However, even this excessive dose did NOTHING for the pain.
I finally went to my doctor and within seconds of explaining the pain and location he prescribed this medicine.
I only had to take 200 mg, for one or two days and my condition ended.

To me this is a miracle drug and thank the Lord for a miracle doctor.
I realize that this medicine is proscribed for many conditions and may not work for all of them, but for my particular condition, it was a Godsend."

Right now i have to go into a meeting at work but i would be more than happy just sitting staring at a wall for the rest of the day.  I feel completely robbed of emotion, feeling, and personality.

My lips have been all tingly since, and i am in a complete fog.  For some reason i am squinting alot, even in dimly lit rooms, and i feel very weak and unco-ordinated.  Im only taking half a pill right now before bedtime.  I sleep pretty good, but wake up feeling very out of it and almost stoned.  right now it's been 12 hours since i took my 2nd dose and i am in a complete daze and very out of it.
Yesterday the facial pain was lessened, but the pain around the side/back of my head was still constant.  
The numbness in my lips is annoying, but i can live with that if i could just WAKE UP and shake this drugged out feeling.  Conversations are an effort.....I'd just like to go back to bed."

My neurologists graciosly pointed out to me that I was a grown man but, the continued heavy drinking and resulting Grand Mals were not advised; so, I returned to an occasional glass of Red and the seizure activity stopped.

I can tell that it is still there because my teeth and gums are numb to the touch making it difficult to eat.  I have found a tremendous help with a Chiropractor. I am not a big fan, but went in with back pain and told him about TN and he did research and when I had pain, he helped it a lot.  Reduced the swelling and the pain went completely away after a few days.  Make sure you find a Chiropractor that practices the ""Gonstead Method"".  This is very important.  Tell him to research TN with his method and see if he can help.  I have had two bouts and it went away within two days of each.  No meds.  The doctor who diagnosed me is the head of Neuro-Surgery at Duke University.  Dr. Allan Friedman.  He told me to not use the Carbamazapine unless I had pain.  The drug makes me very tired and want to sleep all the time.  I was diagnosed 2-3 years ago.  Let me know if a Chiropractor works for you! "

I was hit with the worst pain in my life. Mine occurs at the top of the cheek, below the eye. It took me a week to finally go to ER cuz I just thought it'd go away & was saddened to find out about this ""disorder"". So little knowledge...I was prescribed Tegretol/Carbamazepine started out 1(200mg) 2x/day, then changed to 2 2x/, also at this change Gabapentin/Neurontin was added 1st 1(300mg) 2x/day, then 2x/day. It's now been 5 weeks & I'm only just now finally starting to see/feel the change happening. I do take pain meds as needed, which is slowly declining. But my concern is how long I'll need to take the meds as I'm a young female looking to get pregnant w/in 2 yrs & these meds are frowned upon during pregnancy. I hope they find out more info on this agonizing pain!"

After about a year I began having more episodes with an increase in pain with each episode.  My physician increased my does from 200 am 400pm to 400 twice a day.  I found myself depressed wanting to sleep 12-14 hours day and chronic dull headaches.  I am going back to my original dose and hoping for the best.  To all you TN suffers out there I pray a drug will be developed soon to releive us of our pain without all the side effects.  My physican couldn't put me on carbamazipine until I finished all my chemotherapy but it has definately been the best drug so far (except narcotics) in controlling the pain.

We are still learning about this condition and have had more insight reading reviews. I have more questions to ask our doctor and have learned a lot more from WebMD. He has had siezures occur even if he missed one dose, and also figured out that if he doesn't get enough rest, siezures will occur at school. He had his first siezure while walking last week (at school)and ended up with a bloody nose and fat lip from the fall. We may need to up his dose during his check up this month. A doctor believes the siezures are caused by an injury to the brain but there was no injury that we know of that happened to him. The medication works wonders and he has no side effects other than a stomach ache once in a while. Does anyone know of any support group sites with live chat?

Last week, after taking just one(my first)dose of Carbamazepine,I experienced a very bad recurrence in the middle of the night.  Dr. wants me on 200 mg. once a day, but now I'm afraid to take it again! "

It was completely effective until I was 17 at which time i started to suffer from seizures again. I increased the dosage which made me burnt out, then started another drug, lamotrigine, which has been good, but I've still have partial and a couple grand mal seizures over the last 5 years. Now I'm noticing what appear to be side effects from the list on here. Random pain, and most importantly erectal dysfunction.  
106$Condition: Facial Nerve Pain$6/12/2009 9:31:36 PM$Reviewer: juju, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$5$Diagnosed with TN at 30 it has been an interesting journey.  It took about 3-5 months to get the right combination of drugs, carbamazapine and sertraline.  Finally the pain subsided and became more of a dull ache than the stabbing spasms of electric shocks.  My dose became so high (600mg daily) just to control the pain.  It was worth it.  Then after about 2-3 years it stopped working.  I couldn't take any higher dose so switched to neurontin for 6 months.  Not as effective.  Tried accupuncture, seemed to help for quite a while, a year or more I'd say.  Then almost like magic symptoms went away.  I would catch a pain on occasion but nothing but a reminder of what it was.  Now, 13 years later, it is back with a vengeance and I am debating about returning the the drug.  I am not looking forward to that foggy, tired and weak feeling but anything is better than TN pain.  If you can tough out the weakness and find the right therapeutic dose, it worked for me.  I am counting on it working again.

Have backed off on dosage to try and gain some strength back, but can only go about 24 hrs without taking another 'poison pill' (as I call them) because the TN becomes excruciating.  (It really is the 'suicide disease' because you just want to be put out of your misery.)

The only problem was that over the years my neurologist had to increase my dosage every couple of years. My neurologist told me that carbamazepime was a drug that strangely, tends to build up an immunity to itself, so the longer that you take it the less effective it becomes over the years. I don't know how many people in which this effect tends to happen, but if you are having to increase your dosage every so often, it's most likely that the problem is the one I described. I'm now trying other anticonvulsants, but have not yet really found one that works.

""Onsets"" were non-existant. The medication seemed to be elevating and perpetuating existing symptoms. The medication was easy to ingest and Very Hard to tolerate. Hot Water Bottle or Ice Pack in hand, vertually all possible negative side affects were a part of these sessions. Trigeminal Neuralgia has been coined the ""Suicude Disease."" I consider myself ""fortunate"" here in that I characterize my experiences as a 9+ on the threshold and give a credit of 10 (IF that is the absolute max) to Cluster HA's. There is a history of lower limb reconcstructive surgeries to which I might attribute ""some"" number(s) but am at a loss to do so given environmental variables such as frequency and duration, as would be the case with any of the above in association with the other.

With both TN and Cluster HA's it has been my experience during the periodical adventures that doctors are quite willing to provide a script and say ""See me in X weeks."" Quite often it has already been X days or weeks that things have been progressing; On the floor, in tears, and absolutely helpless! If the Doctors writing the scripts had the opportunity to live in the patients shoes for 24 hours they might not be so casual about treating them as guinea pigs and realize some empathy toward what dehumanizing and painful experiences the patient has been goin through. Trial and error meds shouldn't be the first item on the MD's protocol. HEY DOC! This crap hurts - right here - right NOW. Good Luck Folks. "

I'm taking a number of other meds for psychiatric problems so not sure what interactions may or may not be in play. But the only thing that seems to make sense is starting Tegretol. So beware if you have PSORIASIS, but that may or may not be due to interactions with meds. "

Within three days I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, dizziness, wobbly on my legs, weird eye movements - seemed like each eye was bouncing around independently, and couldn't focus my eyes, but the constant pain was somewhat diminished, for the first time in almost a year and stabbing attacks almost disappeared. Had to cut dose back to 25mg twice a day due to side effects (which brought pain back) and increase by 50mg/day weekly until up to 600mg/day. This dosage just about eliminated stabbing pain and reduced constant pain to tolerable level except for exacerbations, but Dr was hesitant to increase. He added Lyrica which helped a little more, but over past 6 months pain has continued to increase. Just had dosage increased to 800mg daily and experiencing minor side effects again, but pain is easing somewhat. Hope to tough it out and pray for more pain relief. Constant gnawing face pain is becoming unbearable.

I have not had any panic attacks, but still have minor very short episodes of being snappy if provoked and tearful.  One minor short episode of dissociation.  Nothing like I am capable of by history. I have had some unusual tiredness,  minor what I call ""the dropsies"", mild to moderate sexual dysfunction (desire and orgasmic difficulty), a little weight gain,and moderate itching. The itching will most likely be the reason if I stop taking it.  I sometimes feel like I'm having low blood sugar, and when I eat it goes away.  I haven't seen this mentioned as a SE.

Having tried all the neurological medication there is this is the most effective. I needed several weeks to get used to the medication. To control dizzyness, sickness etc. I eat shortly before taking a dose. Rush and difficulties with muscle coordination I mainly have when I had to take a rather high dose. After a few years I was able to reduce the daily dose from 800 mgr to 200 mgr and that is just enough to stay ""good"" and it cut the rush. Indeed, symptoms like a dry mouth, a little bit too less natrium in my blood, feeling more tired then I should be based on my job and other wellknown, I have to live with. Careful use, knowledge about the medicine, a regular life are important. I am hardly taking any alcohol because that triggers the pain and the rush. And every single other prescribed and non-prescribed medicine I need to take, I have checked by the doctor or pharmacy if it might affect the function of Tegretol. Surprisingly many can affect Tegretol, even when I was taking only 100 mgr. Since I took non checked anti-biotica against a blatter infection 5 years ago, I had a severe pain break through, had to be taken to hospital for several days. After that event I am back at 200 mgr daily. Of course if I could I would do without Tegretol. But as long as there is not a better replacement, or even better, a solution for facial nerve pain I guess I have to stick to this. "

I was taking 600mg a day.  When I went for follow up, I was pain free and the doctor said I could start weening off one pill at night and then a half from there.  I made it 3 days and had pain again.  I went back to normal dose and was ok for a couple of months.  Right before the holidays I had constant intense pain and nothing helped.  Doctor increased me to 2 pills 3 times a day (1200mg) and added tramadol for pain.  I spent my vacation and most of my holiday sleeping and being unable to concentrate and getting stuck on words when I speak.  My blood pressure was up and I was taking Norvasc for that.  My bp today was 172/102.  My regular MD checked me later and it was lower, but still high. I also have a fever with no explanation. He took me off Norvasc and thinks my Tegretol levels are too high. He's sending me for blood work.  Time to go back to Neurologist. AND...tonight I have pain again!

Stop sitting in front of the tv all day long and feeling sorry for yourself.Go volunteer at your local cancer clinic (childrens)if you feel depressed.Also  i have put on weight over the years but mostly due to natural body changes and bad eating habbits.Am just happy to get up every morning with no noticable seizure disorder.Keep your mind and schedule full at all times.

There was no generic at the time but when one came out I tried it and it didn't work nearly as well so I had to go back on brand name. 10 years later I tried the generic again due to cost and it works just fine now. Still having petit mal activity occasionally and now new sleep problems. I keep waking up between 2:30-4am. I can go right back to sleep but then I wake up...vicious cycle. Neuro is now trying to determine if I'm having breakthrough activity and wants to try a new drug. He suggests Lamictal or Keppra so I'm researching now. Have a sleep study next week because a recent EEG showed possible seizure activity and to rule out sleep apnea as a factor. I hate taking meds but meds are better than seizures so hopefully I can find one with the fewest side effects. Will post back after I've been on new meds for awhile.

I am spacey, I take this for my anxiety disorder and PTSD At first it was great until my body got use to it. I need a higher dosage to cope better with my anxeity attacks but worried at the same time what this kind of effect might have on me as far as me being more confused, memory loss and distracted. I do however have no problem with these complaints its my fiancee who hates it. Though sometimes I feel stupid cause I can't even remember a simple date like my own birthday or my sons. Or for that matter answering a question thats very easy like whats your age. My anxiety however has been more under control then what it was before i was even taken this So in other words I do like this drug. I can't take anti-depressents because they do the oppisite for me. I become violent and very mean and snap at everyone so this is the drug for me. Just wish i didn't get confused or memory isn't all there most of the time. People then think i'm on drugs(illegally) when they talk to me. But I guess to each their own. Has anyone else had these same effects?

The only side effects I had was feeling drowsy when I first started taking it. Along with the 13 medications I have been on in total, Tegretol is the only one that has worked for me and is still working.
I would like more info. as to why the FDA is recalling it and if that is just in the USA or in other territories as well? Would the recall be Tegretol & Tegretol CR?"

I stayed on it for about 3 months and stopped it on my own.  I figured if my facial pain had gone away, I no longer needed it. A couple months later, my pain came back. I had tingling in both hands associated with this. My general doctor sent me to a neurologist. He put me back on Tegretol and I have been neausiated every day. I bought some phenegran on the internet. It helped some. My neurologist said it would go away but it hasn't. I still have to take the phenegran with this medicine. That is just not right. I would love to go off this drug, but the Trigimeal Neuralgia is too severe. It is the worse pain i have ever experienced. So, I guess I will just have to be neausated or in pain. Which is the worse of the two evils? Face Pain!  Tolerate the Tegretol at night if I have phenegran in the morning.

I have completed my second week on this med and have no side effect except for sleepiness.  Not sure if that's from exhaustion and overworked from a stressful job or from this med.  But besides that, I'm pretty happy with the medication.  Doctor prescribed 200mg twice a day, but I'm only taking once a day b/c I do not like to rely to med. I still have slight numbing pain, which is tolerable compared to what I was experiencing and the pain occur less than before.  Neurontin worked well for me, but made me gain weight, lost memory, blur vision and slur of speech.  Topomax made me lose weight, depressed,lose memory and slur speech.  So far, Tegretol seems to be the answer to my trigeminal neuralgia problem.

316$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$7/9/2009 9:32:21 AM$Reviewer: Joe, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$3$4$I have been on tegretol for about 15 years. It has worked great for controlling my seizures (I have had no seizures while on it in 15 years). However, I am not a fan of taking any medications on a daily basis. Recently I had a dr. appointment and had to get a bone density scan because tegretol is now linked to osteoporosis (have not received my results yet). I haven't noticed any major side effects but I have seen a slight decrease in my passion/excitement/energy for things in everyday life. It also seems to have slowed my metabolism. I work out vigorously 6 days a week and eat pretty healthy as I am trying to lose about 10-15 pounds but am only losing about 1 pound per week (I am sure there are other factors that play into this but feel the tegretol plays a role as well). My personal thoughts, if you have a serious seizure disorder; take the medication it has worked great for me. If it is a mild disorder; try to find some other non-medicated remedy (this is my situation and I wish I would have found an alternative remedy to medication but I was 15 when I started and didn't know any better). I fear it is too late for me to stop now. Good luck to whomever reads this and I hope it helps!

I am going mental!  It feels like I'm high all the time and dizzy and drowsy, all I want to do is sleep.  It really is hard to function, in fact I am not able to work either because I am afraid of making a lot of mistakes and dealing with money that is not a good thing.  The doctor and other people I know dealing with this sort of thing tell me wait 5 days to feel better.  They keep insisting it will get better, well it's taking a long time to reach five days! Oh, yeah I have to take this three times a day, to me it seems excessive, but I'm no doctor.  I'm really hoping for a good outcome, no wait a great outcome!  See, I'm taking this because I have complex partial seizures do to scar tissue from my brain tumour being almost removed.  That's how they found the tumour, from having seizures.  I was fine for a few months, of course until the scar tissue started to form and grow, and now I'm having too many seizures per month.  So, something needs to be done.  I hope this is my amost cure, I will stay in touch, and hopefully I'll be ableto inform people it's working, and I'm seizure free, I really need some good news!

They diagnosed me with a seizure disorder and prescribed this medication to me.  As of this point, I haven't been able to go back to work and I'm terrified to drive!  Next week my dosage will go up 100 milligrams, so I know it will be a few weeks before I'm used to it.  I just don't feel like myself right now, and I got my period in the middle of a pack of birth control pills!  It's a weird feeling to describe though...now I have cramps on top of it, but I'm lethargic yet silly at the same time.  Sometimes I feel like if I turn around too fast I'm gonna fall over or drop something.  I was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 26 (had my first seizure when I was 23) so I know things take time..I'm gonna give it a few weeks before I go back to my neurologist to try something else.

   1. Had been on tegretal many years. Tried weaning myself off high dose 1000mg daily due to high tegretol levels(400mg in am and 600mg pm). As I did this I began to become extremely congested as if sinuses swollen. No runny nose. Only diificult to breathe. Returned to normal dose, congestion gone. Has happened several times. Now  if levels get high and I need to decrease dose, I go slower even 1/2 tab at a time.
    2. Found if I take 3 tabs (600mg) at one time and I take 2 anacin (400mg ASA with caffiene) I become extremely dizzy, light headed for several hours. This I have also tested several times.
    3. Have had problems with the generic brand NOT keeping my levels up. So must have my MD write for brand name only."

To the person who posted ""I actually passed the pill in my stool after 12 hours for a 24 hr extended release"": What you passed in your stool after 12 hours was the shell/casing, not the pill itself. And each pill lasts 12 hours, not 24. That is why you take it twice a day instead of once. Hope this helps someone with the same concerns. :-)"

413$Condition: Manic-Depression$1/6/2008 10:39:51 PM$Reviewer: celticmaiden, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$3$4$Tegretol seems to help me identify my depression from periods when I'm manic; this helps because knowing what mode I'm in, I can treat the symptoms of depression like not being too hard on myself, knowing my limitations, accepting them, be kind to myself, make sure that I eat. When I realize that I'm manic, I treat the symptoms by taking a walk to release increased energy & journaling to purge myself of racy thoughts. I still cycle about every 2 weeks, and I have terrible problems with irritablity & anger management. Whether manic or depressed, its all about self-care. Before taking tegretol, I was in a state of constant chaios because I didn't understand what was happening with my mind. I thought I was either going crazy or just being carefree; I couldn't understand why I couldn't keep a job and such. The only side effect I feel I have is fatigue. Tegretol does not do alot to control my manic-deppresive episodes; there are times I feel like I could crawl out of my skin, my head reels, and things seem so surreal or I get so depressed that I don't get out of bed for a couple of days feeling catatonic. Like I stated before, the tegretol does help me identify my mood swings somewhat and that helps.

After 2 1/2 years developed leukopenia so had to change to other meds, but fortunately it turned out that TN was in remission.  But in spring 2013 TN flared up with a vengeance - worse pain than before, constant pain 24 hrs per day (couldn't even blink my eye).  Ended up having to take 60 mg Cymbalta 2xday, 100 mg Topamax 4xday, and 100 mg Lamictal 2xday.  Side effects extremely dry mouth, dry eyes and dry all mucous membranes; feel extremely confused with word loss, loss of short term and long term memory, loss of ability to think logically (bad for me as a business person), loss of creative ability (bad for me as an artist), in short unable to function - everything takes twice as long to do.  BUT the advice that I have for every body being treated here and that no MD ever told me before my recent desparate trip to the Mayo Clinic:  since you are being treated with meds that work by suppressing the Central Nervous System, anything you consume that stimulates the CNS works against your meds.  So quit drinking all colas (Coke, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, etc), coffee, tea, chocolate, etc. and sugar.  Also, as is noted on your meds, unless you want to go to sleep and perhaps never wake up again, don't consume alcohol.
Cutting out caffeine really DOES make a difference in the effectiveness of your meds - I discovered this the hard way."

When I started to have trouble was when I had a large weight loss. I wanted to lose the weight because I had struggled with being overweight since childhood and decided that I didn't want to be left in the dust all the time because I was fat. So I lost 120 pounds and had asked my neurologist if I needed to change anything with the dose and he told me no. Well I ended up in the  hospital twice do to low sodium levels. I found a different neurologist that now is getting my dose correct for a different medicine and I have not had sodium problems since I was taken off the tegretol xr. I hope this is helpful to someone. Don't be afraid to get a second opinion.

Also, no more exhaustion.  HOWEVER, the adverse affect I experienced was a sore throat.  I had an ultrasound of my throat and lymphnodes taken and all was normal.  I'm still on this med and the sore throat has calmed down to almost extinction.

I think I'm more tired than I used to be.  I haven't had any seizures since I began regularly taking this medicine and I've been on it for around 9 years now.  (My seizures have been controlled and cause no problems in my life, but I may just have a calmer disorder to begin with.)

I had previously tried Dilantin, but had some adverse reactions.  I have no such problems with the Tegretol, and find it to be easy to take on a regular basis.  I have been using it now for 8 years and have had no seizures.

533$Condition: Manic-Depression$11/8/2007 5:34:18 PM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$I started taking tegretol and the next day started to have double vision. I tried to wait it out, but it just got worse. I stopped and restarted the medicine to see if it would do better a second time around and it just put me to sleep. It ruined my birthday.
