1$Bipolar Depression$6/27/2014 5:02:31 PM$Reviewer: DaDan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I do not feel ""drugged"" like I did when I taking Wellbutrin. I am only required to take one Latuda in the evening, which is very convenient. During the next day, I am usually active and feel generally brighter, and my memory is far better than when I was taking Wellbutrin."

7$Bipolar Depression$12/2/2019 3:21:09 PM$Reviewer: JCGlines, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$4$It just WORKS for me.  I haven't gone into 'the willing pit of despair' since taking the drug and that accomplishment alone makes this drug more valuable than any other I have taken.
8$Bipolar Depression$12/1/2019 5:07:13 PM$Reviewer: Jackson B, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$2$Ended up waking up in the middle of the night with heart palpitation/irregular heartbeat. They said everything was ok and sent me home... meanwhile i feel like a heart attack could come at any minute. Don’t take this trash.. been three days and im sttuck in bed because I feel like a heart attack could come at any minute. Simce the manufacterer says heart palpitations arent a side effect he suggested I continue to take these death pills. Needless to say hes not my dr anymore...
10$Bipolar Depression$8/16/2019 4:21:28 PM$Reviewer: Bipolar disorder, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$2$5$The medication worked great for the bipolar disorder, best so far. However, had to stop it immediately after 2/3 weeks cause I started to loose my hair. Like really loose it, this side effect is not listed as a side effect but it sure was, be ware
11$Bipolar Depression$8/11/2019 8:11:12 PM$Reviewer: Minnie Wa Hoo, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$3$It has pulled me out of my depression but I am having so many other side effects I'm not sure if it's worth being on it.  Here's but a few side effects I am experiencing.  Runny nose but not like I have a cold my nose will run and I don't even know it's going to happen it just runs right out my nose.  It's embarrassing when I'm talking to someone and this happens.  Teeth clenching this goes on 24/7 and is causing me to have a tight jaw and giving me headaches.  Constantly picking at my head out of nervousness, I now have open sores on my head.  Exhaustion, Acne,(I'm a 65 year old women with acne) YES! Nausea, Dizziness, Loss of Appetite, Anger, Spending Tons of money maybe I'm Hypo-Manic, I'm not sure. Diarrhea, Stomach Pains, Coughing for no reason, Loss of Balance, Restlessness, Trouble urinating, Memory loss, Blurred vision, Confusion, Headache, that's all I can think of right now I'm sure there's more.  Anyway after I wrote all of this down I've come to the conclusion that this drug has to go.  And I'm only at 20mg. I'd hate to see what would happen on a higher dose.
14$Bipolar Depression$4/26/2019 5:18:32 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$I began Latuda after my Dad died, and I was suicidal. It helped get rid of my suicidal thoughts and helped me feel motivated to finish my last semester of college. I noticed it made me gain about 20 pounds over the course of 4 months, and sweat profusely at the gym. I was tired all the time, and would take 1-2 naps a day, for about 3 hours at a time. I would still be tired. My appetite increased and I had to be put on Topiramate. 
15$Bipolar Depression$4/10/2019 2:07:49 AM$Reviewer: vh, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$this is the worst medication ive ever taken and ive been a lot of common anti psychotic/mood stablizer/anti depressants before. gave me SEVERE heart palpatations, force me into psychotic breakdowns/panic attacks. felt like both incredibly fatiqued and manic episode at same time.
16$Bipolar Depression$4/4/2019 10:11:52 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been on countless medications and none have given me the feeling like I could really live. Yes side effects but they are controlled. I take half of an imodium with it and eat with it. So no longer have issues. I actually have real feelings and don't feel like I have had a lobotomy. The cost to me with my insurance was 15.00 after i used the company coupon.  No tardive dyskinesia side effects.  I weaned off zoloft and am left with wellbutrin and latuda. No weight changes noted this far. No sexual issues noted either but I would give all that up to feel this good. No feelings of dread and heaviness left. I have energy again. I have chronic insomnia for almost 30 years and no changes in sleep noted either. The only drag is having to it with it so I just take it after evening meal before bed as it makes me slightly drowsy but that's a good thing for me. 
17$Bipolar Depression$4/2/2019 12:38:51 PM$Reviewer: Braniff, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$1$I felt that it might be helping me until, about a month into treatment, i starting involuntarily moving my lower jaw. I would be talking to someone and they would ask what i was eating..it was my jaw moving. When I went in to see my psychiatrist he saw me doing it and asked about it. He then said it was a side effect of Latuda and took me off. The jaw movement stopped within days.
18$Bipolar Depression$3/19/2019 12:21:07 PM$Reviewer: Jenny76, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$Pdoc and I agreed to add Latuda to my regime of Wellbutrin and Topamx after a few months of increasing paranoia and depression that I couldnâ??t lift despite changes to my diet and increased exercise. At 20mg, side effects have been minimal. Initially, the nausea was bad but taking it at night with the requisite 350 calories works and it seemed to pass after week 3.  Six weeks in, I am up 8 *very unwanted* pounds but the weight, if it stabilizes, is a small price to pay for mental clarity and marked improvements to my bi-polar depression.
19$Bipolar Depression$3/4/2019 4:39:56 AM$Reviewer: Bcbake11, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$Caused a pleathera of atrocious side affects the worst of them being profuse cold sweats, inability to hold Bowles and urination frequency increased dramatically but volume of urine was scarce... vertigo at times inability to tolerate heat or cold, EXTREME PARANOID FEELINGS bad enough to report an aquatinted person to homeland security as conducting terroristic activities... then There were awful tremors confused and disoriented feeling accompanied by memory loss and the severity of that promted me to report to local detectives that I was being drugged by one of my in laws... and short term memory I kept only lasted approximately 2 weeks then erased forever. But BY FAR the WORST symptom was an overwhelming inability to communicate with others even intimate partner.  Thought I was brain damaged after this went ok for months which nearly drove me to suicide and I have never in my life had those thoughts even remotely cross my mind. It was like being a prisoner inside my own body, or some kind of muted person. I was hurting emotionally I would cry in the car sometimes so badly it would induce hyperventilation so bad I had to pull over on I-95 and I every day thinking about driving as fast as I could into the cement barrier. Thankfully upon stopping my voice returned and I expressed all of my awful sensations to everyone who would listen just in cas I went mute again. So it could be considered as to have induced PTSD.  Stay away if possible, I was put on latuda for anxiety and this medication is life altering so in my opinion unless severe dangerous schizophrenia or psychosis are present the. No dr should EVER prescribe it. I’m pleading with you to please avoid latuda use, the instability is DANGEROUS!
21$Bipolar Depression$12/22/2018 7:30:02 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Everything is good but it caused me gain lots of weight! 
22$Bipolar Depression$11/16/2018 1:01:50 AM$Reviewer: Floyd, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have tried many medications over the years. This one is working quite well after only a few weeks of being on it. My doctor started me with 20mg samples. For those without insurance, it was quoted at $1800.00 for a 30 day supply (Walgreens). I have insurance, but the pharmacy wouldn't give me a price unless my doctor submits a prescription to them. I am thankful for the samples, but very concerned about what it's going to cost me when I get a prescription. Go figure......I find something that works for me, but might be too expensive to continue using."
23$Bipolar Depression$10/26/2018 9:43:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug is the one that works for me. My anxiety and aggression is down, I'm more positive, and no longer tired and depressed. I haven't experienced any mania since I started. I experienced an eye twitch that went away quickly on day one. By day two I started feeling better.
24$Bipolar Depression$5/30/2018 2:03:06 PM$Reviewer: Shaun 420, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Thank God for this medication. Been through some rough times and a lot of different medications. The only problem I had was with sleep for the first week. Did not sleep much. But things are good now. Back to my 5 hours of sleep.haha. 
25$Bipolar Depression$5/27/2018 1:34:46 PM$Reviewer: LaDeeDah, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $1$1$1$Son committed suicide after dealing w/ bipolar successfully for twenty years.  Avoid and at the very least pay good attention to how you are feeling.  Do not ignore negative signs.
26$Bipolar Depression$5/6/2018 3:35:50 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I have been on many many medications over the past 22 years. This is thee worst medicine I've ever taken. Within 5 minutes of taking it my stomach felt like it was on fire and then I would throw up violently. Because of this medicine I now have an ulcer. If at all possible try and avoid taking this. It's horrible, most medicines have some side effects but this was brutal.
27$Bipolar Depression$3/27/2018 12:17:54 PM$Reviewer: Ben, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have BP2 as well as a host of other axis 1 dx's, along with unremitting insomnia.  I was in the middle of a 3 month storm when I was taken off seroquel and sertrline and put on Latuda.  That day the mania stopped and my family said that my physical features and voice had actually reverted back to my baseline in a matter of hours.  I feel great.  No weight gain but I suspect that I am having some impotence from the med, my BP is also very high but that is probably from the insomnia.  This drug stopped me from killing myself.  I hope my insurance covers it because I feel myself again and I can't go backwards . . . again.  
29$Bipolar Depression$1/15/2018 8:02:44 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$3$WARNING! This drug can have SEVERE side effects.  I have developed a condition called cervical dystonia in which my neck muscles contract constantly and it is impossible to be still.  It is extremely painful and very expensive to treat.  I would never recommend this drug to anyone.  The condition I have is rare but this could happen to you so I would ask my doctor for an alternative.  I am now taking Lamictol and doing just as well.  Please be careful when taking this drug and if you notice any weird muscle issues in your face or neck notify your doctor immediately.
30$Bipolar Depression$11/26/2017 6:51:55 AM$Reviewer: Julio, 65-74 (Patient) $5$5$5$"Other anti-depressive were tried with no success so I decided to just deal with my ""cyclical mode disorder"" and put up with the down cycle until the up cycle comes back. Laduda, for me puts me back to feeling like myself and not having to worry about ""cycles."""
31$Bipolar Depression$8/2/2017 12:17:01 AM$Reviewer: Canf1candice, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $5$3$5$I've been taking this medicine along with Lamictal for almost a year. The combination of the two has been amazing. I have had side effects of weight gain and low sex drive. With that being said I will take the side effects over the cycles associated with Bipolar Depression.
33$Bipolar Depression$6/25/2017 5:49:31 PM$Reviewer: Helen61, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$3$After being hospitalized for mania, the hospital Psychiatrist took me off my Seroquel and Prozac and put me on Latuda 80 mg about 2 months ago.  I have problems taking it at dinnertime and with food because all I want to do after taking it is go to bed then I wake up about 3 am and cant get back to sleep.  I also have restless legs now and my therapist recommended Geodon which is great another med I have to take with food.  I would rather have the restless legs.  I talk with my regular psychiatrist this week and am going to request going on my old meds (Seroquel) I don't see what the use of taking Latuda alls I want to do is sit around and do nothing it really doesn't help with the bipolar depression (at least yet, maybe I am being to quick to judge)if my Dr says no I should stay on Latuda I will be willing to give it another couple months, I have tried every combination of drugs possible (after 24 years of being diagnosed bipolar/schizoaffective) I just wish that they could come up with a med that helps you function instead of giving you so many side effects I wish I would just stay in bed all day.
34$Bipolar Depression$5/26/2017 11:19:22 AM$Reviewer: Ludovica, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug is miraculous, it made a difference the next day after taking it for the first time with ZERO side effects. The symptoms did nothing but improve with time. I take 20 mg with meals and as a monotherapy for BP. I didn't believe in drugs before this one, I had been on Lithium, Lamictal, Risperdal for short periods of time due to non-compliance for lack of visible results or side effects, and frankly, nothing had work noticeably like this. People would say, keep on trying, there is something out there that will click with your chemistry, and I guess I'd been lucky to find something without lots of trial and error. It's a very expensive drug but the manufacturer has a patient assistance program that can cover most of its cost. The best thing in the world!!!
35$Bipolar Depression$4/26/2017 9:14:04 PM$Reviewer: katiermb, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$3$I was on this medication close to 2 1/2 years now. My doctor and I decided to discontinue this drug due to some side effects. My boyfriend originally pointed them out to me, but I gained weight and had a serious decreased sex drive. My boyfriend was stationed overseas for 2 years, so the decreased sex drive wasn't noticeable until he came back to the States and we saw each other more often. I knew I had gained weight, but when I tried working out and calorie counting for two months and didn't lose a single pound, I realized it was most likely due to this drug. I tried changing every medication and this was the last one I could change. I still experienced mild mania and depression episodes while taking Latuda, but they were tolerable. 
36$Bipolar Depression$1/12/2017 6:44:59 AM$Reviewer: Lindsay, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$4$I've only been on this for about a week now but I love it. Will need something for the hypo mania it's bringing out in me, but I don't feel my character or life is threatened by it like in Manic episodes. I see my doctor next week but I can live with this and the persistent cough and aching runny sinuses until then, along with some night of nearly no sleep if this will (AND IS) helping with the depression side of things. Suicidal thoughts are completely gone, wanting to self harm is gone, I can function well most hours of the day and get my job done right. It's a wonderful first step and I am very happy with its effectiveness. Just wish the physical symptoms weren't so overwhelming. Have to take right before bed cuz it turns me into a zombie for about 3 hours usually. 
37$Bipolar Depression$1/11/2017 3:13:11 PM$Reviewer: Laura, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$I can't rate this higher yet as I've only been on it for 2 weeks, but it seems like it is working pretty well so far. Had a little bit of insomnia the first night but taking my dose in the morning (along with 1mg of Cogentin) helps that. No other side effects so far, and I haven't gained any weight, maybe even lost some.
38$Bipolar Depression$1/10/2017 12:41:56 PM$Reviewer: Leslie Doyle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I've been taking Latuda 60mg for just over a year... and I haven't had a bout of depression in just over a year.  When I was taking lower doses, I was still hitting depressions.  But I love that it's kept me stable for the longest period of time I can remember.

He no longer gets or keeps an erection since he started taking this medication. 
42$Bipolar Depression$11/10/2016 8:13:12 PM$Reviewer: europe1127, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$When I first began taking this medication I was started off at the 40 mg dose. I began having really bad anxiety and panic attacks. When I switched to the 20 mg dose after talking to my doctor I noticed a huge decrease in scald ideations and mood swings. I am very happy that I stuck with this medication. Anti depressants have also increased my suicidal ideation and I have not experienced that with Latuda.

44$Bipolar Depression$9/8/2016 3:03:58 PM$Reviewer: Brooke, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$3$5$I took latuda late for about a year and a half but recently stopped due to severe nausea. I was severely depressed when I began this med and it worked wonders for me. Best med I've ever used for depression but the side effects are horrible. I have severe nausea when I take it on an empty stomach or when I dont eat enough. I've thrown up before too. Even when I do eat at least 350 calories I feel slight nausea. I started taking it right before bed time but then I would forget to take it and fall asleep so I only took it half the time. I am not able to loose weight while taking this med due to the needed calorie intake. Unfortunately I had to stop taking this med.

Waiting to see a Dr. about Ketamine Fusion, hopefully I'm a candidate for that because I'm literally ready to lose it, been on almost every med out there, had 16 ECT treatments, been hospitalized, I don't know how much more I can take! :(
50$Bipolar Depression$6/10/2016 4:42:18 PM$Reviewer: BP and OCD, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$This is the only atypical antipsychotic I have tried which touched my bipolar depression. It took a few months to really work but eventually I lost the sense of doom and tragedy that was afflicting me every day. I now have low grade depression, as opposed to the severe depression I lived with for about 11 months. I wish I had tried Latuda first instead of Risperdal and Abilify, neither of which worked (and Abilify gave me increased suicidal thoughts).

I take when I have low energy and trouble getting out of bed due to depression. My doctor knows of side effects and believes in using only when needed. It works within a few days and I generally stay on for 4 weeks 
54$Bipolar Depression$3/28/2016 11:58:35 AM$Reviewer: Matt, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$4$"I have been to the doctor, it had started off the i was diagnosed with anxiety. I had tried numerous ""top rated drugs"" and have experienced terrible side effects like poor libido, agitation, and worsened anxiety. I went to see another psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with ADHD. I had taken Vyvanse and it would make me race and jitter and i felt unstable. I was ready to give up. I went back to see him and informed him that this was making me worse I described some of my issues and he then told me I have a underlying disorder related to bipolar spectrum. He prescribed me the Latuda. I was cautious as i read reviews and was terrified to take it because of some people experiences. I then decided to try it out. Thankfully I did. After the first 2 days i noticed a huge improvement with my mood and ability to be more positive. My wife noticed a tremendous improvement and she even said I made her more ""calmer"" as I used to get angry easily and not I speak more passive and are able to control my emotions. If i could recommend one thing for somebody on the fence about trying it. Please dont get discouraged by the reviews as your own experience will be different from anyone elses, and secondly, a higher dose does not mean better effects. I feel better at a lower dose than a higher one. I hope this helps somebody out!"

64$Bipolar Depression$12/1/2015 2:15:36 PM$Reviewer: Satchel, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$I started taking Latuda 4 months ago. 80 mg once a day. It has lifted my mood considerably. I used to sleep 12 hours a day lots of negative thoughts. I am more hopeful now but still have severe down periods where the negativity comes back and i am suicidal again. But when I am better I am so much better. Downside is i am only sleeping 3 hours at a time sometime 5 or 6. I do have some agitation in the muscles with flexing. Other than that I have kept the weight off. It is the best medicine I have been on in a long time other than the sleeping issue which is hard to get used to. I am also having some anger issues but they are better than on the lamictal i was on before.

68$Bipolar Depression$11/17/2015 11:48:31 AM$Reviewer: Daniel86, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$After years of battling anxiety/depression I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 about a year ago. I've been on Latuda for 2 weeks now (20mg first week, 40mg second week). I am on Brintellix as well, which has helped a ton with my anxiety but hasn't helped with my depression. It took over a week for me to feel any effects of the Latuda, but I have begun to feel a little more in control of my thoughts and behaviors. My depression has lifted to a certain noticeable degree, particularly in the mornings and during the work day. Evenings are harder for me to figure out what to do with myself, and I would often get home from work and want to drink to quell the depressed thoughts and have the night go by faster. Since feeling some effects of the Latuda I haven't had the urge to drink my nights away, although I still feel like getting in bed really early even if I'm not tired. Prior to Latuda I was on Lamictal and Abilify and my depression just stayed the same over time. I have a follow-up visit with my prescriber in a few days and I expect she may want to increase the Latuda, which I am all for at this point. No significant side effects noticed from the Latuda thus far. I take it at lunch time with the 350 calories recommended since that is my biggest meal of the day. After trying many different medicines over the past 4 years and very little progress, I am quite optimistic about Latuda after being on it for only 2 weeks. I would recommend anyone give it a shot based on the many reviews I have read and my experience so far.

I was told that it would help with anxiety and panic attacks not sure what dream world they came from cause Latuda made mine worse!right BUT my mania was controlled very well and I WAS HAPPY about that! BUT I had such overwhelming fatigue, I didn't even have the energy to shower for days ( and I didn't care) my fatigue was so bad I seriously thought something was medically wrong with me, so did my friends and family and the doctors did too when my friends and family finally got me to go see someone, I  so many tests run on me it was unreal ( I did have some health problems but nothing that would cause such debilitating fatigue  and finally one doctor said maybe it's your Latuda so with nothing to loose I stopped (likely for me I didn't have any withdrawal or anything)Bad news less then a week went by before I was hit with a full blown mania.And I still haven't lost any weight :-( All I'm saying is make sure you read up on the meds before you take them I started Latuda because my Doc ( a Great Doc) went to some convention about Latuda and the promoters really impressed him or something I guess cause for like 3 appointment that's pretty much all we talked about was how much this NEW DRUG could help me! And I let him sucker me in just like the promoters sucker my doc in LOL lesson learned.I Just wish I could find the right drug or right combo of drugs that would work for me!

78$Bipolar Depression$7/4/2015 1:20:26 PM$Reviewer: Dreamer , 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$"I was on 20 mg Latuda with 300 mg Lithium. It was the most normal I have felt in a while. For me it has being weight neutral in comparison with Zyprexa. Zyprexa made me gain 5 pounds per day & 80 pounds in a few days. Latuda gave me more energy to work out. Naturally, if I don't take meds I don't even have to work out & have a fast metabolism & loose weight easily. With meds I need to exercise. However, the main difference is that with Zyprexa I would exercise 5 times per week, 2 hours per day, eat healthy & still gain a ton of weight. Latuda helps me maintain healthy weight. Unfortunately, my doctor decided to increase my Latuda doze to 40 mg. I am now experiencing Tardive dyskinesia & going back to 20 mg again. Wish me good luck!

I've noticed an improvement in motivation, and a slight improvement in my mood; however, I still had to add some other medications to help counteract my depression/anxiety.

Side Effects: Headaches and nausea, even when taking it with the recommended 350 calories. What I've found is if I eat ~500 calories and something somewhat fatty/greasy (cream cheese, chicken nuggets) it prevents the headaches and nausea. If I don't do this I will still get headaches and nausea; it is something that has yet to go away.

Overall, this medication has helped me more than any other recent drugs. I would recommend anyone to give Latuda a try."

I've been on everything and loved many anitconvulsory drugs like Lamictol and Topomax but had rashes, blurriness and had to stop them. This is the only thing that has come close to making me feel better. I gained weight on all other types like Abilify, Lexapro, Celexa - you name it, I've tried it. This has made me more active (like I used to be when I was happier and younger) and I have lost weight in 12 days. I am 43 and have been depressed and bipolar since the age of 20 or earlier. My life has been a big struggle but with meds and therapy, I'm much better. I've been very successful in my life but always dealt with sadness, hopelessness and mood instability that I've tried to hide but as you know, it catches up with you. Latuda is good - for now I really like it. I hope you find something that can help you too.

I don't know what we are going to do. My depression is worsening because of how long I have suffered now. It has been over 2 months. This drug is not working for me.
88$Bipolar Depression$2/6/2015 2:43:32 PM$Reviewer: ers95, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$2$While I still have a long way to go, Latuda has been the very best medication I have been on, and I have tried a lot. I have tried so many medications it's pathetic. I started at 20 mg which I noticed slight improvement but still felt the dose needed to go up and we slowly over time went up to the dose I am on now. So I take 80 mg of Latuda in combination with 60 mg of Prozac. As I said, I still have a very long way to go as far as my bipolar and my anxiety and my psychiatrist said we will likely add BuSpar to the mix when I see him next. If you are someone who has tried several medications with no help, I highly recommend Latuda. It takes time to wrok but it's worth the wait.

However I felt better within 2-3 weeks of taking it. I was on it for a year. Over this time I gained 20 pounds and my hair could be pulled out and it felt lifeless and super thin. I lost over half of my hair but there was balding.  It just thinned out. Other then that I loved it. It put me to sleep at bed time and slowed down impulsive behavior and rage. I didn't really watch the calories and eat a meal before taking it as recommended but i felt like it worked anyway. I felt normal and balanced. I have tried nearly every medication in this class and others. This one had the least side effects. I quit taking it by steping down at 20 mg every two weeks. I had no withdrawal but after three weeks of no latuda I feel the symptoms returning.

99$Bipolar Depression$11/25/2014 2:53:00 PM$Reviewer: esummey, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$2$I rated this 2 stars in the ease of use because you have to take it after eating at least 350 calories to assure it will actually work. My psychiatrist said it won't even work if you don't take it with food. This medicine has been amazing for me and probably the best medication I have ever been on. It helps me sleep so I don't even need to take trazodone anymore. I have lost weight being on it, unlike other antispychotics that make me gain weight. I still have mood swings and still have moments of depression. The mania is controlled better and like the depression, it is not as bad. Anxiety is also a lot better. If you are someone who has a mental illness and have almost everything, or are treatment resistant like me, I recommend you give it a try. The only side effects I have are mild EPS (extrapyramidal symptoms) like slight tremors and shakiness but other than that I'm fine. I'm very overweight so I really appreciate the weight loss. I hope this helps someone. Just because it helps me doesn't mean it will everyone else, but I recommend trying it!

My experience with this drug has been overwhelmingly positive. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 6-7 years ago, and this is the first medication that I feel comfortable taking for maintenance. At 40 mg, a 180 lbs male, I have felt just slightly sedated. Apart from the sedation, which is a ""zombie""-like effect, having to take this medication with almost 400 calories is at times bothersome. I would like to decrease my dosage to 20 mg, and will consult with my psychiatrist later today regarding the matter. However, the benefit of this medication is nothing short of miraculous. Again, I have not had a better experience with a psychiatric medication."

My doctor increased my dosage to 40mg and it was way too much. My jaw would clench up all day long and I would have panic attacks after I took it. The anxiety was terrible. I also felt really inebriated, like I couldn't drive a car or be at work after I took it. I went back to 20mg and I still enjoy improved sleep. Still experience some mood swings, but the side effects are manageable. Slight jaw clenching, vivid dreams, breast swelling, and a little grogginess in the morning are all that I experience now.

I was on 450mg/day of Seroquel for a month and gained 25 lbs in that month. I told my doctor that I couldn't take it anymore.  It was like a miracle drug for me. In conjunction with 150mg of trazadone, it really helped me sleep better because I have always had a problem sleeping. My weight gain was bringing back my depression though, so my doctor has me tapering off Seroquel and onto latuda now, so I'm down to 200mg Seroquel at night and 20mg of Latuda/night for one week, then 100mg of Seroquel/night and 40mg Latuda/night, then off Seroquel completely. My doctor told me that he has had some people say that this drug has made them loose weight but also that he cannot guarantee that it won't cause any weight gain at all.  I'd like to know how many people have actually either gained or lost weight on this drug?

Like I wasn't ""in touch"" with my feelings or thoughts; like a zombie in a way.  Then the suicidal thoughts became worse than they had ever been in my life.  I just felt like I didn't care about anything anymore, like I was just going through the motions.  Anytime I felt overwhelmed, I immediately thought of suicide.  I'm 45 years old and have only had 2 other times in my life where I was suicidal and all of the sudden, I was thinking about it almost every day.  I was scared to stop taking it.  My prescriber wanted to increase it instead but I was afraid of going into a deeper hole.  I started taking it every other day and now I have been off for 4 days.  I realize now just how foggy my head really was.  It had happened so gradually I didn't even realize how bad it was.

My serious problem is that I've run out of my Latuda and my doctor does not seem to want to refill my prescription! It's been a month now and I'm feeling like a jack in the box. With 8 different brains. I DO feel withdrawal and I may as well be coming off of heroine.

I took 20 mg for 2 1/2 months and initially experienced brighter mood, seemingly quicker thinking, and enjoying the taste of food better. I had more energy. The main difficulties appeared to be focusing and in the first month, word finding. Looking back, I found notes about occasional suicidal thoughts, urinary frequency or incontinence.The final week after trying 30 mgs suicidal thoughts increased, I became agitated, very irritable, and cried often and easily, quite out of the norm for me. Anxiety was heightened.The withdrawal process has been uncomfortable, including nausea, cramping, and diarrhea. Two and a half months later I am still not back to baseline behaviorally. The combo of fluoxetine and depakote regime is what I've returned to. The lure of Latuda's elevated mood was insidious and kept me from taking in negative symptoms sooner. I was diagnosed with mood swings in 1978, Bipolar II 2004 or 2005.

So he put me on latuda the first 3 days were ok my engery level increased and I felt a little better. After 7 days I was very angry, filled with anxiety and restless. I had a hard time sleeping but I would wake up easily. After 2 weeks I was severely depressed and no desire to live. I stopped it immediately. I did not gain any weight with no desire to eat. Eating 350 calories before taking it at night was a challenge and inconvenient so I took it with my last meal. This was not the med for me and is very similar to saphris which also made me feel the same way.

The first symptoms I noticed was my stomach aching and reduced hunger. To be honest, I didn't mind these.  The only side effects that really got to me was the heat intolerance, the endless thirst, and constant need to pee. One day, I drank more than 2 liters of water but this only made my thirst worse and at that point, I took a break off the meds. Only 4 days off and mania hit me pretty bad so I am taking it again. I will talk to my dr. about these symptoms.

She said to take it on a full stomach for it to work properly. So, my biggest meal is supper, in the evening. The first few days I was fine, then on June 15th After about a hour after I took it, I started feeling really antsy. And my legs wouldn't be still, my arms were jittery. All this while I'm trying to sleep! Forget that! That is one of the side effects of this medication. But what I loved was that FINALLY after years and years of this medication and that one, this one made me (mentally) feel great! Finally! I was thinking clearly, was able to socialize, be in public places with crowds. From the 2nd day I was on it, I felt great! Now these side effects!! Will talk to the doctor tomorrow and see what she says.

On 20mg noticed increased anxiety and temper outbursts (although the Dr. gave me Kolonopin for the anxiety) and many crying episodes for no apparent reason. I still hear the voices but now have a numbing sensation at the top of my head. At least I can't hear myself blink any more. I also take Abilify 20mg for the voices. My thoughts are scattered and I am tired after taking the Latuda and Abilify. I have notices weight increase but I think it is from water retention. I will take the 40mg for the rest of the month to see if anything calms down. Have not had the side effects most have been experiencing but am having muscle aches and spasms, lots of aches and pains from the weight gain in such a short time. Not enough energy to walk of exercises at this time. Not sure yet how I feel about this med, will reserve judgement until I've been on the 40mg for a few weeks.

I am bipolar1 with schizo-affective disoder. The first four months were rough. Extreme nausea and vomiting. I have to take it before bed because it makes me very sleepy. BUT it is a life saver for me. I am a new person. The paranoia is vurtually gone, the depression is much better. I haven't had a suicidal thought in a long time. I still have some hallucinations though ( my dr. told me I tend to be medication resistant.) I have been on almost all other anti-psychotics and anti deppresents there are and this with a combo of 300mg. Lamictal and 150mg. Wellbutrin has saved me. I have had suicide attempts before these, that is no longer a problem for me. I also have not had a manic or hypo manic spell since being on Latuda.
142$Bipolar Depression$5/19/2014 1:49:31 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$5$Latuda is a miracle drug, whoever invented this drug I'd run up and hug them if I saw them. Okay maybe that's a little dramatic, but this drug is a life saver to me. I take lithium 900 mg now to treat my bi polar disorder, and xanax for anxiety, and they both work very well. However, I still suffered from depression and anxiety. Sometimes it was debilitating. The doctors have tried so many drugs on me- wellbutrin, celexa, Cymbalta, Zoloft, trofanil, and a few others. ALL of them I had terrible side effects on. The most common was insomnia and manic episodes. My anxiety was through the roof on most, and NONE did anything towards my depression. I gave up on antidepressants, and I bought over the counter meds like 5HTP and St. John's Wort (St Johns gave me full blown panic attacks), and I went on trying to live my life. I still battled depression, I'd sleep all day and self medicate with pain pills. I became an addict and had to detox several times. One day I was watching TV and saw a commercial for Latuda, a depression medication for bi polar disorder. I went to my psychiatrist and talked to him about it, and he gave me two months worth of 40mg samples. In the beginning I was becoming concerned because I was having really bad dreams and I was feeling no effects of the drug after 1-2 weeks even though reviewers made it seem it works almost instantly. People were seeing results in a week. But I kept taking them every night, having bad dreams, waking up feeling dreary and bored everyday. I've now been on the medicine 28 days, and I feel WONDERFUL. FANTASTIC. My anxiety is next to nothing, I'm much more calm and serene. I'm happy, I feel like the world is at my feet and I can do anything I want. I have hope again. As for self medicating I have no desire to feel any different than I feel now because I feel AMAZING. I find myself planning and making goals again. I look forward to things, waking up early and smiling at the birds chirping. I'm amazed and so grateful. Finally.

However, she gained so much weight (20lbs in 2 months) and she still had weight to lose from her previous meds, that she fell back into a deeper depression.  Her weight increased so rapidly that we took her to an endocrinologist to rule out Cushing's Syndrome (excessive cortisol production in the body).  We are still waiting for final results, but the doc thinks it was weight gain caused only by the med (Latuda).    "

Started on a 5/1 Thursday morning, by Friday PM. had symptoms of severe sinus infection. Dizziness and at time heart rate would increase. Stayed in bed from Friday 8:00 pm thru Sunday 1:oopm. Continued medicine thru Saturday 5-3, felt I couldn't handle the side effects. Skipped 1 day & started taking again on 5/5. Still noticed the heart racing and odd feelings of anxiousness,that did not last more than 20 min at time. Noticed some strange tinges in brain, probably just the way med was working in my system. So know I have taken from Sat 5-10 to Tuesday 5-13. On Monday & Tuesday(12th &13th) started having small twerks in hands, face & arms. The top layer of my skin is numb and I feel a small numbing in my tongue. Have a call into Dr. and also have appt. on Thurs. I am feeling a little better on this med, Seems as each day goes by I feel a difference leaning in the positive direction only in a different way than other meds have effected me. I have not been diagnosed as bipolar, but have tried almost everything for my depression/ADD/Anxiety. I'm supposed to be on 20 mg for 1 month, then see Dr. Just hoping the side effects go away and med helps a little more each day. Has anyone else had the side effects I've mentioned? If so can you share if they improved/got worse? What did you do?

I would recommend anyone try this drug.  I have not taken anything that has ever come close to the results as this and trust me I have taken everything.  May have had a few side effects in the beginning for about 2 weeks but none that I can see now.  Just be sure to eat something before or during the time you take it in order for it to metabolize correctly.

In the beginning, I did notice a difference in my mood. I noticed I was happier, and I was making better decisions instead of being impulsive. I also take 900 mg of lithium daily for bi polar disorder, and this drug drastically changed my life five years ago. I used to be impulsive and wreckless, in and out of jail and police contact. It completely stopped when lithium came in. However, I was still struggling with bi polar depression. In these years they tried celexa, Zoloft, cymbalta, wellbutrin, trofanil, and Prozac. I had severely bad side effects on all of them, the worst was Zoloft. It made me severly manic and I couldn't sleep for days. I was giving up on anti depressants, until I saw a commercial on Latuda. I talked to my psychiatrist and he gave me 2 months of samples of 40 mg Latuda. Since day one I've had really strange dreams that are more like nightmares. I've also noticed I'm in a daze a lot and tired. My appetite has decreased so I get really nauseous when I take the medicine. I have to force food down my throat. I think I need 20mg because 40mg is for more schizophrenic types. Maybe I'm too sedated I don't know. But I really hope this works out because I have no options left. But the weird dreams and the ""out of it"" feeling is not worth it if this never goes away. "

I seemed to be handling that dose really well.  It didn't immediately have a miraculous effect on my bipolar depression, but did seem to be slightly helping.  Then my Dr. doubled the dose.  I was up to 40 mg and felt like the Latuda was really trying to do it's job.  The next time I saw the Dr. he doubled the dose again -- up to 80 mg a dose.  Then I started having some real problems.  I couldn't focus, sleep was a luxury I wasn't getting much of and I felt exhausted and foggy all day, every day because of my lack of sleep.  It was greatly affecting my live, and not for the better.  Then the sicknesses came.  My stomach was in a constant state of flipping over and over on itself 24 hours a day.  I started violently vomiting and having daily all day diarrhea sessions.  I stopped taking Latuda last week without checking with my Dr. to see if the drug was causing a lot of these very undesirable side effects for me.  I am feeling physically and mentally better than I was a week ago so feel going off Latuda was the right decision for me.  I now have a new set of problems that I don't know if they are related to the Latuda or not.  I have MASSIVE swelling in my feet, lower legs, ankles, hands, fingers, and wrists, it's pretty frightening.  If they haven't gone down by tomorrow morning I'm having my son take me to the ER to see what's going on.  It's actually very frightening and painful.

The doctor increased my dosage and I would sleep up to 16 hours and of course woke up severely depressed because I had wasted an entire day. I have also decreased the amount of calories I take in per day but my weight either stays the same or I gain weight.

It has helped my sleep or lack of sleep hallucinations both visual and auditory. It has not helped at all with suicidal thoughts. Honestly, apart from lithium and it's potential for toxicity, latuda is the worst medication I've ever taken for my bipolar disorder. I have no idea why the doctor increased my dosage other than thinking more might be better. He is a great psychiatrist and I trust him but I think he is just taking shots in the dark since we've had no success in combating my disorder."

Was on 300 mg Seroquel and gained so much weight also my depression was so bad. I always felt tired. Been on Lutuda 2 weeks and I love it. At first I felt angry and sad. That passed at day 9 and I feel better than I have in years!

Been taking 60mg for 2 weeks. Most antipsychotics knock me out asleep. I'm noticing my mood is getting better, less depressed, but not manic. 
186$Bipolar Depression$1/8/2014 6:24:22 PM$Reviewer: Saigon1975, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$"I am a long-term 72-year-old bipolar/1 who has suffered both severe manic and depressive episodes in the past eight months.

While the manic episodes have been occasionally dangerous, the depressive phases have been far more debilitating.  Unable to get out of bed, severe anhedonia, etc.

I have been prescribed at least 25 psychotropic drugs over the past 25 years and NONE except CONCERTA (methylphenidate) have had anywhere near the  positive effects on me as Latuda.

As others on this board have said, for me it is a LIFESAVER.

I feel alive again!  Energy, calm, and a good mood have returned after decades.

The only side effect of my 40mg daily dose is severe drowsiness and a bit of headache, so I take it just before going to bed, when the sleepiness is an advantage.

190$Bipolar Depression$12/17/2013 9:18:28 AM$Reviewer: captainharvest, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I have been treated for 20+ years on many different meds. I was on abilify for 8yrs. and it started to not treat all of my symptoms any longer so doc. tried new drug latuda. It was a nightmare after 10 days I could not sleep, had poor balance and was dizzy, very confused and could not think clearly at all and finally started slurred speech before getting off of it. These side effects came with NO relief of my symptoms. This was probably the worst experience I have had with a medication in 20 yrs.
191$Bipolar Depression$12/8/2013 11:10:51 PM$Reviewer: joyw4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$4$I have been on every bipolar/depression med you can think of. I have been resisting all antidepressant/antipsychotics for the life of me. But I felt such a depression coming on as the seasons started to change. I had NEVER EVER heard of Latuda. Gained 70# with zyprexa, seroquel, effexor, etc. I've been on for 6 weeks started at 20mg first 4 weeks and now 40mg. No bad side effects. I hate having to eat with it. It's like forcing myself to eat and I usually eat late so I have been making myself have a late lunch/early dinner. It makes me a little tired but not overwhelming. I cannot even fall into a depression. I feel focused, I have energy and all around feeling good. I do get stuck like becoming OCD. But hey, I'll take that over falling into that dark pit again. We'll see how it goes. I will post later but so far I am so happy I switched pdocs and found Latuda!
193$Bipolar Depression$12/5/2013 6:31:48 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$2$"I started taking Latuda eight months ago to replace Seroquel.  Seroquel helped stabilize my mood swings, but I felt tired, craved carbs and gained weight satisfying that hunger, even waking up in the middle of the night to eat ice cream.  I still experienced regular periods of depression while taking Seroquel, which is why my MD switched me to Latuda.

Taking 40mg Latuda made me want to jump out of my skin and it caused a major case of restless leg syndrome, constantly moving my legs to calm me down when lying in bed and waking up in the middle of the night, ending up falling asleep curled up on the couch.  I reduced to 20mg, and then down to 10mg (cut 20mg tablet) at night, which is effective. I have been struggling with taking the medication at the same time every night and eat sporadically, so more likely to not eat something when taking Latuda, which may decrease efficacy.     

I generally don't experience depression quite as badly or as regularly as I did, less anxiety overall, and more positive outlook on the future.  I do get out more and I can focus on details better when I do work on personal finances, paperwork, etc. but still struggling with managing time, becoming easily distracted after setting personal priorities on a daily basis.   

I didn't know it could impact menstrual cycle until I read someone else's comment (thank you). I thought it was menopause because my cycle is not as consistent as usual, but side effect of Latuda makes more sense because my periods tend to last longer now.     

I think it has been effective addition to the cocktail of meds, all of which I take at very low dosages right now.  

Regarding the patient whose Dr is making her take it, tell your Dr that the side effects are too severe to make the med effective.  If your Dr isn't willing to change your meds to find one which is effective for you, it's time for you to change your Dr.  No one med is a cure all for every person regardless if health issue is mental or physical.

194$Bipolar Depression$12/3/2013 5:15:40 PM$Reviewer: PA patient, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I just started it last night, so really can't say if it works or not.  I told my doc last night that I just had blood work done that shows low white blood cell count (2.9).  He also knows that I just lost over 125 lbs.  He said it's weight neutral, but you have to eat when you take it.  Now I read the literature and see that it shouldn't be taken if you have low WBC, and I'm seeing post after post about weight gain.  I think I'm going to stop right away.  Not at all happy about him giving me this med when it clearly states that people with low WBC shouldn't take it.

Well it was the worst experience with medication I have EVER had!!! I had the restlessness that wouldn't go away and irregular heartbeat.  I am now on permanent HCTZ a water pill due to the side effects of this medication!! I would never reccommend this to anyone ever!! It took the prison 3 weeks to finally change it, so I had to take it or else I was a complete wack job!! Lesser of two evils was feeling like I was on speed for 3 weeks straight and about 1 hour a sleep a night... Anyway best of luck to all who take it!!!!
