1$Anxiousness associated with Depression$9/29/2019 3:17:30 PM$Reviewer: Madmac, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I’ve been on sertraline a little over a year now and I’m generally happy with the drug. I’ve had depression and anxiety as long as I can remember but since starting sertraline i’ve been more motivated and have less suicidal ideations. I have a few side effects, most notably restlessness, especially in my legs, when I try to sleep or sit still. It’s always been an issue for me, but the drug has certainly made it worse in that regard. Otherwise, I’m doing pretty well. Hope you are too.

13$Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/25/2018 1:47:41 PM$Reviewer: Eli James, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $2$1$3$I took this medication and it was by far the worst antidepressant I have ever tried. It didn't work at all. I had persistent panic attacks while on every single dose. I had to change my dose around 5 times, each one of them not showing any improvement. I don't recommend this for anyone who has multiple disorders and is being told to treat them all with this. I was told this would help with my OCD, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and body dysmorphia. This medication made me feel worthless because it was so ineffective.

I had exactly those side effects you described from one particular brand.  It was Tillomed.  They set me back a long way.  My doctor gave me a new prescription so I could request a different brand.  I've found both Crescent Pharma and Aurobindo to be excellent brands, both in 50mg.  Some teeth clenching, and my sex drive is flat, but otherwise my physical and mental health is bright.  Now into my 5th month.  Have been told I'm being weaned off soon.  Fingers crossed.

I realise now that I was depressed and had attacks of anxiety for many years thinking I was normal. More recently (2-3 years) I have been very angry, cry at silly things, not wanting to go out, very negative, memory loss It got to the point where I thought I was going mad.  My husband made me go to the doctors.  I finally gave in and I haven't looked back.  I feel fantastic. No more crying, feel amazing.  Happy to socialize.  I never want to come off of them.  They are a life saver!

It works extremely well when it is taken consistently, but if you are on a high dose like I was and missed even one pill it can send you into a downward spiral. As far as helping with overall anxiety it has helped tremendously but situations sometimes still can send me into major anxious fits.

508$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/3/2019 6:13:08 PM$Reviewer: betteroff, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$At 35 weeks pregnant, after a bad week with depression and not being able to sleep well at all due to anxiety, I visited a GP who prescribed me Sertraline 50mg daily. I had never had this drug previously. After my very first dose, 2 hours later a woke from a nap and shortly after had an intense panic attack. I DO NOT have a history of panic attacks, but I've experienced the very initial onset of them so I was aware of this building feeling. Usually this onset feeling has not lasted more than 30 secs, but this time it came on within 30 secs into a full blown panic attack. Had I not recognized what is was I would have called EMT. Attack lasted 30 mins. I had 2 more of these attacks before bedtime and never came down from the last one. I was awake all night feeling like I was constantly on the edge of having a panic attack.

Sertraline (Zoloft) has made a huge impact on my life, including helping me sleep and enjoy my hobbies again. The worst part about it was the exhaustion or tiredness I experienced the first week or so, but that went away pretty quickly. 
517$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/21/2019 11:07:03 AM$Reviewer: ANON, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$"I started this medicine two weeks ago and stopped taking it after the first week.  I was still experiencing racing thoughts, and anxiety.  Nervousness, butterflies in my stomach.  It did make me happier in a sense and helped my social anxiety, however it made me extremely tired mid-day every day. (Taken in the morning) Fatigue almost, with tired feeling and later I felt more depressed than I have ever felt. It also made me VERY nauseous to the point that I felt like I had the urge to throw up inside of my throat. 
Side effects: Dry Mouth."
518$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/21/2019 4:35:17 AM$Reviewer: E, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$2$1$Started 25mg because of a breakup and job loss. I didnt think I needed an antidepressant like Zoloft, but the Dr. recommended it. First week was hell; insomnia, diareah,no appetite and still anxious. 2nd week getting better with the shits and appetite coming back. If you drink alcohol while on it, prepare for a horrible next day as far as being depressed. Everyone is different and Im not sure I need this, so I drank a few nights while on it, and it didnt kill me. Most days it makes me not sleep, so I drink a sleepytime tea. Im only 2 weeks in on this Zoloft, and I also have .5 lorazepam I can take also. That puts me out within 1 hr. Most people on this thread seem like they benefit from this because they have a lifelong struggle with depression, which is great if it works. Maybe I will see a change in another 2 weeks, but I think these first 2 weeks is too soon to judge it. I would say give it the 4-6 week range Dr's tell you and maybe you'll feel better. As far as alcohol...stay the hell away from it unless you wanna feel like complete ass the next day, feel more depressed than when you started this med and possibly do horrible damage to your liver. Ask me in 6 months

I don't eat and when I do I get nausea, except I crave salt. I bruise easily, which is bad because my equilibrium seems to be off. Bump into things a lot now. Dizziness; my head feels as if someone is squeezing it. Pretty much just general lethargic. But since I have no serious symptoms my dr says I need to continue. Not sure how long I can function this way.

571$Anxiousness associated with Depression$11/29/2016 1:29:00 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$So I have only been on Zoloft for a week, not sure why I am giving a rating right now, because I have been told by my doctor that I won't get the full effectivness until 4 weeks in, but I am still going to give a review.  I suffer from anxiety and some depression.  I am taking 50 mg once a day.  I am always tired, and it's a fight to keep my eyes open during the day at work.  My attitude is calmer,which is nice, but sometimes I catch myself staring out into outer space (if you get my drift), maybe it's because of being so tired.  I also am experiencing dry mouth.  I notice I perk up close to the time I have to take my next pill.  Not sure if this is how I want to feel, tired all the time.  Unmotivated really, I went from doing everything to do nothing or not wanting to do much.  LOL, can't win.  Anyways, I try it out for the full month and make up my mind at the end of 4-5 fews if I want to pursue. 
578$Anxiousness associated with Depression$10/5/2016 11:17:46 PM$Reviewer: jbsx129, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$4$Started taking this shortly after returning from an overseas deployment to Afghanistan a few years back.  I had problems way before going but it seems things got worse when I returned. I couldn't even get my haircut without getting a panic attack and just having to sit there with crazy thoughts in my head while trying to maintain small talk.  I started avoiding situations all together, sitting in a classroom seemed unbearable.  I would experience a panic attack probably once a week which would trigger a deep depression.  I thought once I had experienced that first panic attack that I was broken inside and ruined for life to forever have panic attacks.  I went to the doctor, explained what was happening and got lucky enough to find this one first which works for me.  I have been on it for 4 years at 100mg.  I only experience slight anxiety which is exactly what I want as I can use that anxiety effectively in a situation, and the depression is only normal sadness I'd say, nothing like the things I experienced before. I hope you find what works for you. Don't give up after just trying it for a week or two, it takes a while and it may get worse before it gets better.  Also, I did know a close family member that tried taking an SSRI and it caused acute psychosis with a complete detachment from reality.  It turned out they were bipolar and SSRIs were not compatible, lesson in point have someone close to you monitor you and make sure you're not going cookoo, you crazy SOB

I would still recommend it to anyone with severe anxiety or depression.

I am a 41 year old male, with no previous mental health issues, and am physically fit and eat healthy as much as i can. I am in good physical health and do exercise daily. I had no idea what an SSRI was and simply took the medication based on my doctor's best advice as he said it would ""make me feel better"" Boy was in in for the shock of my life! Here is a short journal of my first few weeks on ZOLOFT:

Was originally on low dose Ativan by cardiology but my family doctor weaned me off it......not supposed to be used long term!!!!!

I felt happier but it also made me too passive (which is unacceptable in my job) and had severe sexual side effects. My doctor gradually weaned me down to a small dose and added a moderate dose of Wellbutrin. I was skeptical because most everything I had read warned against this drug combo but it has worked perfectly for me. as others have noted you do not want to suddenly stop taking this med.

It should be made a class A drug. It is basically legal bath salts. It gave me thoughts of carelessness, hostility, aggression, violence, increased sex drive, thoughts of rape, suicidal thoughts, irrational thoughts and I wanted to kill people I care about. I am a very Anxious person but all of those side effects are way out of my characteristics. One afternoon after a heated argument I went home angry and I had just had enough of Zoloft. I went against doctors orders and flushed all the Zolfot pills down the toilet. It was the best choice I ever made after enduring 3 days of horrible withdrawal effects. I am now on track to recovery. I have Anxiety Disorder and mild Depression. I warn you its not worth it. Never take Zoloft or any SSRIS drugs like that. Take my word for it. Trust me. I have finally got the courage to warn you and prevent you from making the same mistake as me. I would rather smoke 1 pack of cigarettes a day then take Zoloft.

1 1/2 a.m. and the same at night.
Makes such a difference. 
People react differently to same medications we may be taking.. Go to a professional. who knows how and what to prescribe. My family has history of depression/anxiety the females in the family find that zoloft works well for all of us. (genetic?)  I was diagnosed with a anxiety problem at 13 yrs old.  Those were the days of valium..only. Very difficult time in life when these issues really weren't discussed. I didn't start taking anything until I was 42yrs. Tried any and all natural health products. I don't like to take medication, but I am attempting to be responsible and know that I do need it, for myself and others that are in my life.

I can honestly say I have never felt worse in my entire life, I have had almost every side effect listed on Wed MD, including eye twitching and a lazy right eye. I cannot sleep, I have tremors and feel like I was punched in the face. My muscles are chronically sore and aching. I cannot focus, my mood has changed subtly but not drastically. I feel like a completely different person. I'm chronically exhausted and just cannot function like a normal human. Am going to try to continue at just 25mg however, personally after reading reviews it does not look like this drug is the best. Please read the reviews before starting an SSRI like this one.

I am much more social now.  I didn't realize it at the time but I was carrying a lot of stress and negayive thought paterns. This has all dissappeared as well as the depression. I have regained my ambtion to exercise and as a result have lost about 10 lbs. At the same time I started taking zoloft dr advised me to start taking 2000 iu of vitamin d which also seems to be very bennificial also. Just started taking a multi vitamin and have substantially reduced complex carbs in my diet. In summary I ended  my depression and anxiety by starting zoloft and eating a more healthy diet. I highly recommend.

14$Depression$1/21/2018 2:17:03 PM$Reviewer: D1nonlysnshn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been a ""highly funtioning"" depressed person for many years: life of the party, witty, intelligent, charming, intelligent conversationalist, highly successful at the top of the food chain in my field,
...until I got home. Work was an escape from myself for me. If I had no weekend functions to attend I would be catatonic, only getting out of bed to use the bathroom.
I had always felt like an outsider, looking in on life, trying to imitate what everyone else was doing, but never getting it quite right and others sensing that I was a fake.

I retired in Jan '17. Not having work as an escape anymore, in Dec my depression got again very bad. I talked to my girlfriend and she recommended sertraline as it has helped her. On 5 Jan, I saw the doctor, she prescribed 25mg as a started dose for 8 days, then 50mg, with a follow up 6 weeks later to see if the dose would need to be increased.
I experienced loose stools, wake/sleep cycle issues, decreased appetite, jaw tightness and jittery feeling initially. I experimented with taking my dose at night because it seemed that immediately after taking it, I had to go back to sleep. Taking it at night then kept me up. So I went back to taking it in the morning, as I figured it was a matter of me getting used to the med.
It has only been 2 weeks, but it seems like a lifetime ago.  The anxiety subsided first, then my depression. I no longer think of the smallest thing as the greatest catastrophe, my thoughts are no longer chasing around in my head like a bunch of squirrels and I am off the emotional roller coaster.  Thoughts from my past no longer send me into apoplexy. 
I no longer feel like a walking dead person-dead on the inside, waiting for physical death to catch up with me. No not suicidal-many years ago I came to the realization that I can only live once for a limited amount of time, but death is forever. Also, as long as I was alive, I always had a choice, but once I was dead, there was no coming back."

I feel less fear to think about and talk about my problems and begin beating them. I have some intermittent shaky vision from them, but not so much it's a concern. Also my appetite is strange. I'm getting hungry, but quickly feel full during a meal. I take one tablet daily and the effects are lasting long enough to get me to the next tablet without any problem. I have a 28 day prescription with counselling to begin very soon.  I will update if anything changes.

As my wife said at times it was like treading on eggshells with me.  I was put on 50mg of Sertraline and after a week or two I felt human and happy again.  I came off the tablets last week after about 3 years (had tried after one but it was too soon) and feel fine.  If I suffered any side effects then not sure what as some things could be put down to getting older although not too old, just coming up 59, but feeling tired at times and yawning is about as bad as it got.  Maybe some colic but easily sorted with the very occasional domperidone pill.

Not all sertraline manufacturers are the same. I take the one made by aurobindo. After taking it for over a year (after a 15 yr break from name brand Zoloft which didn't give me any trouble), I started waking up with severe anxiety a few mornings/week. I feel like something terrible is going to happen and had to take an inventory of what's going on for the day so I could calm down.I have breakthrough depression where I'm depressed for twenty minutes or so, then it just disappears for days. I get really tired but have trouble sleeping. I also get shooting pains through the side of my head and more ""regular"" headaches on top of my typical migraines. I've checked on this and there are issues with the generic. I'm going to see if I can switch to the original Zoloft or ask Walgreens to change manufacturers. Look up your manufacturer, check out other people's experiences and print it out to show your doc if you need to. We all know that some don't like to listen to patients. The first generic manufacturer was green-something. I did get an *extremely* dry mouth and eyes, but after a few months it got better."

45$Depression$7/6/2015 6:07:40 PM$Reviewer: chester, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$In March, I mentioned to my MD that I was feeling slightly depressed. He prescribed Sertraline (Zoloft). Stopped after 5 days because of severe side effects (insomnia, diarrhea,nausea,headaches). Side effects stopped immediately. About a week later developed a rash, starting on torso, spreading from chin to ankles. In next week or 2 developed blisters over entire body, covering nearly every sq. inch. Very painful. couldn't sleep . This is now July. Most blisters have gone. Some scabbing remains with a few open sores. Treatment began in April and will continue for 2 more months. 5 doctors feel that (although not 100% certain) that the Zoloft caused it since that was the only drug recently introduced. The result was a condition called Bullous pemphigoid, a rare skin condition. Although I'm sure that many people will tolerate this drug, I can only suggest that they proceed with caution and stop it at the first sign of side effects. This is the worst condition I have ever experienced. Docs also mentioned that this is more common in people over 60.

My  depression/anxiety has definitely improved, but I wouldn't say I'm at my 100%. To be honest, I do sometimes have suicidal thoughts I did not have before, but the warning label DID say that people under 25 could experience them. I know that sounds like a huge reason NOT to take this antidepressant, but I just remind myself its the drug making me think that way and then I feel fine again. I do recommend this to anyone who has mild depression. For anyone with severe depression, you may want to try something with less ""intense"" side-effects."

It made me feel extremely ""sick"", ""dizzy and disorientated"" and my head felt heavy and ""big"". This usually occurred around 10am. I felt so bad that I would crawl into bed and sleep for about a hour. Usually felt a tinny bit better after I slept. As per the prescription I increased the dosage to one tablet at night - thinking that the increase may help - but it became worse. I used the one tablet for 2 days only then went back to using half at night. I also thought that I will rather cope with the depression than feel this bad. I have since stopped using it completely.

Not so with sertraline, it took about 3 weeks to start making a difference(150mg a day)but the result is profound.
I noticed when lowering the dose it causes dizziness and chaotic thought patters and when I have any alcohol at all I have no memory whatsoever from during having a drink.
And I get hit by an overwhelming depression afterwards so I stopped drinking alcohol altogether.
Sertraline changed my life around 180' from being suicidal to be able to have a successful career.
As mentioned in other review it does effect sex drive but to me it is a side effect I can live with taking in account the benefit it provides."

I have an appt w/DR in 10 days, but if nothing changes in next couple days I will stop taking and contact my DR. As soon as I started getting restless and panic attacks were worst, I remembered feeling all of this before and that is why I am concerned. I am so tired of feeling like a shadow of who I used to be and I don't like it at all. This Med has about the same effect on me as muscle elaxers; Instead of helping me I am one of thode rare people that has the reverce effect on me. Instead of decreasing or stopping my severe restless legs, this drug Increased the restlessness in my legs and had me up from my hospital bed from about 1am to 6am walking the hall up and down for this time period because when I stopped the restlessness was too severe. Final Note:I also am my husband's caregiver and have been for 5 years. He has severe brain damage because he died twice and lack of oxygen and blood to his brain caused the damage."

117$Depression$5/10/2013 10:21:05 AM$Reviewer: nonbiased, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$5$I took sertraline (Zoloft) for about 2 months to treat anxiety/depression. The drug guide I have, because I am an RN, and my practitioner said I needed to take it for at least 3 weeks to a month to see the effects. After about 2 weeks, I started getting dizzy spells and felt lethargic. This came intermittently. After about a month I noticed the dizziness wasn't near as bad but I could not concentrate to anything to save my life. At the second month mark I decided to pull myself off because it was starting to effect my decision-making ability. It may have helped the depression a little, but not enough had I kept taking it. When I stopped taking it, I got really bad dizzy spells, withdrawals, and sometimes had to catch myself grabbing the walls or anything around to keep myself from falling, which came intermittently as well. This was just from taking it for two months. While I was withdrawing, I searched the internet and found others who had the exact same problems with the extreme dizziness. It took me another 3 weeks to stop having the dizzy spells. I would rather deal with the anxiety/depression than to take this medication again. Keep in mind though, this medication may work for some and not for others, but coming off the pill is hell. Not to mention the loss of libido is not a wanted action to the medication.
118$Depression$5/2/2013 8:22:27 PM$Reviewer: Tawanda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$5$I started at 50 mg...had on-going problems w/ fatigue, so the doctor suggested that I increase the dose to 75 mg. I've experiences weigh gain while using this drug--which I am not happy about. Another doctor suggested that I try Wellbutrin. The online reviews seem pretty mixed--and the side effects many experience during the initial weeks of use sound pretty unpleasant. Any advice??
120$Depression$4/26/2013 3:39:11 PM$Reviewer: rain26426, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$Taking generic Zoloft 50mg.  I've been on it almost two weeks.  So far it's helped with my depression and social anxiety issues.   And strangely enough, I feel like I have more desire for sex. The first couple days I felt drunk and impulsive, but that went away. However, other side effects hit me like a ton of bricks this morning. Since I've started taking the medication, I've been in the restroom every 1-2 hours.  This morning I woke up with what felt like the equivalent of taking 2 Dulcolax. Also, had nausea/vomiting, fever, sweating, and both triceps went numb. All of the symptoms went away, but I'm afraid I will experience more of it.

I can't say that it's perfect because I still experience moments of mania and depression while on medication but my dosage increased and hopefully it will be just like when I first started. It was first numbing then absolute normality. I felt like me again.

I'm a college student, and I basically feel numb. I hate it. I stopped going to class, and stopped completing my homework, it makes me want to sleep all the time, and I feel super withdrawn. I feel like I'm on the outside looking in and that I can't tell myself to wake up, every day is like going through the motions, and I don't truly enjoy anything anymore. I don't really look forward to anything, I basically stopped caring. And sex..... I pretty much don't care about it anymore, it's extremely difficult to orgasm, or to enjoy sex. I used to love sex. Very awful feeling.

Although 200mg is working, my side effects are annoying. In the morning I would get acid reflux, so I switched to the afternoon and take it with food, no more acid reflux, BUT, shaky arms, nausea and drowsiness. It has been dificult exercising now.

I don't understand how one seritonin uptake inhibitor can be so different. I used to think crying all the time was normal. I was put on Zoloft and my whole world brightened up. Not sure sertraline is quite as effective. That being said.  Regarding side effects, I haven't to my knowledge had any of the bad ones.  I think one should not be afraid of trying it. If it doesn't work.  Stop.  I couldn't believe how much better I felt on it. I'm up to 100 prescribed but am halfing it and hope I don't have to be on it forever, but for now I give it a great review. Psychiatry is trial and error. Thanks!

218$Depression$6/20/2011 4:24:20 PM$Reviewer: John, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$I believe this prescription, although not perfect, has delivered a positive result. I have not experienced the severe side effects noted here...vivid dreams, loss of appetite to a certain degree, however nothing as severe as what I have read. I spoke with my physician and pharmacist just today and with research, have learned that often a secondary medication serves to compliment this (or whichever primary medication), one may be using. I also agree with several of the posts here re: the benefit of exercise, which has shown to produce significant physiological benefits. Bottom line ... don't give up! I am facing bankruptcy, among other challenges, and although we will all have good and bad days, there is never a good reason to harm oneself or others. I choose to stay positive, and hope you will too!

It has affected me so postively, and I've been on it for two years now. I hope to eventually wean myself off of it, but as of now I'm extremely happy with it. The bottom line is, you have to find the drug that works for you. I'm sure many people experience horrible side effects, but I have never experienced any, whatsoever. I am thankful for this drug because without it I'm a nutcase. However, it is important to see a therapist in conjunction with medication. That makes a world of difference.

I tend to become recluse and irritable. On the days I take it as directed, however, I am much more social and patient. I could still use some more help with sadness and irritability, but don't want to increase my dosage so am seeing a psychologist along with my psychiatrist. Bizarre and vivid dreams are very common for me, too, but do not interrupt my sleep or my day. Finally, it's helped a lot with my anxiety and stress levels. I am a physics major in college so the added stress of that to life in general makes taking this medication a wonderful option for me.

When I got home, my insurance only covered generic sertraline. I must say, it is not as nearly as effective as zoloft. Also, the side effects are nearly unbearable somedays. Headaches where it hurts to move my eyes, and drowsiness beyond belief. Somedays it works and some days it does not. I can say with certianty though I still have panic attacks and depression while taking it.

My hands used to tremble when my husband would get upset with me over something. My whole body would feel ""shaky"".
   My only concern is missing a dose. One day I missed my pill (50 mg) and it didn't affect me, so I started to take it every other day, on the third day of skipping it I had what I believe to be a panic attack. I was really jumpy, got snippy with people and just couldn't concentrate at work. I won't do that again but I'm worry about what will happen when I feel I can stop taking it."

It is by far the worst I have ever been on. My doctor started me on the 25mg 8day then 50mg 8days then 100mg daily. It has made my life so hard that it made me more depressed and more aniexious. The side effects are killer. Always Naususa, uncontrollable diahirrea, headaches, Excessive sweating, dry mouth, awful taste in mouth, no sex drive. It has made my life a living hell. I am on the generic and am in the process of being weaned off it, only a week left at 25mg. I do not recommend this to anyone, I am going to try to do without anything for awhile but probably go back to lexapro or cymbalta they seem to work not as good but no side effects.

I have felt side effects, but thought that it was just me. Now after reading other posts, I am definitely sharing side effects with others. Dry mouth, lethargic but not enough to keep me from a full time job or doing things that I enjoy doing, increased appetite, decreased sex drive, & instant moodiness when I stopped taking it about a month ago. I am now back on it and I am making an appointment with my DR to see if there is an alternative that will be more beneficial to me, as the decreased sex drive is beginning to effect my marriage (married almost two years).

After 6 months, I got off the drug & had no panic attacks since.  Recently, I was diagnosed with depression. I requested Zoloft again because it had worked wonders for me in the past. I wound up using the generic. I've been on a low dose of 25mg for the past 4 days & have terrible insomnia (as I write this, I've been awake since 3am) teeth grinding, headache, severe nausea & diarrhea. I can't use this anymore. I just read an article that said patients tend to have more side effects with the generic vs brand name of this drug.

270$Depression$6/11/2010 10:58:39 PM$Reviewer: Sad Mom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $1$1$3$I am writing this for my daughter, Julie.  She was perscribed this medication to treat her depression.  She had had thoughts of suicide a few months prior to taking this medication.  After two months of taking these pills she passed away from suicide by hanging herself in her father's basement, she was 17 years old.  She had had severe trouble sleeping, shaking and also severe mood swings.  She also experienced heavier then normal menstral cycles.  Doctors should monitor these patient taking anti-depressants with more care.  My daughter was admitted to an Ontario Canada hospital with her first suicide attempt, they released her only after a couple of days.  The original stay in hospital was to be two weeks......All I can say it is sad when hospitals would much rather give a patient pills and not the care they need.

I attribute Zoloft with getting me out of the street as I went from teaching to being homeless due to a severe emotional breakdown.  I don't know where I would be without the Zoloft.  I do know, for a fact, Zoloft should not be given to children or teen-agers as they are TOO strong.  Zoloft should be give to adults only and by that I mean 30 yrs and up.

It took forever for me to finally admit that I had a problem and go to my doctor, but thank God I finally did. It took me three weeks to notice any really serious improvement, but once I did it was like I finally got my old self back again.  The only side effects I have experienced is a very slight decrease in interest in sex (nothing major, just takes a little bit longer) and drowsiness. Since it has caused drowsiness, I simply started taking it at night and solved another long term problem, insomnia. Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with the results.

I started on the 50 mg dosage and was moved up to 100mg this month.  (Got moved up due to lots of changes coming into my life, not that the 50 mg didn't work)  
I have had a few strange dreams in the past, as well as having trouble sleeping (especially when first starting the drug and the dosage up-age) 
I have had a lower sexdrive but can usually pick it up after a while.  I haven't gained weight on Sertraline, rather I've lost 40 pounds in the last year--no changes in sitting on my butt or anything. =)
I like this better than lexapro and celexa, I think it works better and a bit quicker.
It did take a week or so to notice changes in my mood (for myself anyway) so don't think it's an overnight thing."

I'm pretty sure this is only because it could be too high of a dosage though and I'm too worried.  Usually side effects like thoose don't last long and my doctor is always there. Overall this is a good drug. Though like any other drug, there is really not much of a grey area.  It either works for you or it doesn't.

Sertraline helps me get a handle on my terrible depression, in the morning.
However, it only takes the rough edges off the depression.
I can not remember ever not worrying about something, but in my older age, it is much worse.
I do like the way sertraline has helped me make it through the day, but wish my depression would totally leave."

I have noticed things are brighter and more optimistic so I definately feel like it has helped with my emotional breakdowns and I can actually laugh and enjoy more things now.

362$Depression$5/31/2009 2:02:27 PM$Reviewer: Alaina S, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I switched from Lexapro to Zoloft about a year ago and it has worked very well for me.  The only down sides to it are slight weight gain and lessened sex drive but considering it pretty much got rid of my manic depression and anxiety it is worth sacrificing those two things.  

One note:  for about the first two weeks you take it you will have moderate to severe nausea, or at least I did.  It passes though so don't stop taking it.  It also occurs again if you forget to take a couple of doses (as well as your symptoms coming back...).

Also, Zoloft may change the way you taste things.  I used to smoke but after about a month of zoloft the taste of cigarettes made me instantly sick to my stomach and eventually so did the smell of the smoke (I guess this is a good thing though).

Also, if your depression/anxiety was causing you not to have a good nights rest you will have the best sleep of your life on Zoloft but for first month or so be sure to schedule at least 8 hours for sleep or else you will wake up lethargic. "

I was not happy. Then I started this medication and in a few weeks I was feeling better. I could laugh at the things that would usually get me to cry or angry. side effects were headaches for the first few weeks, diarreah, sweating, and my labido decreased down hill and fell into the deep end. It takes me a long time to have an orgasm, sometimes none at all.

I don't have panic attacks anymore and my depression isn't that bad. I tried so many drugs before this one and was very afraid to use this one but it did help a lot and I am glad I am on it. I have been on it for a few years now.  It took about a month for it to work totally on me but I did feel a lot better after two weeks.  The only thing I don't like about this pill is (sertraline HCL tablets by Teva USA)are much larger and uncoated.  I would rather take the brand name instead.  Yes I do get dry mouth and my sex drive did slow down. I also am alittle cranky if I forget to take it. But I can live with this. Before I could barely function.

I am weaning off it now. The only side effect I noted was a loss of libido, and I am less of a ""copntrol freak"" - to my employees' and son's delight!

I have used other medications for depression and everyone of them made my symptoms worse than they were to begin with, I am been on this for over 6 months and it sits well on the stomach, aids in getting to and staying asleep.

My moods have mellowed, which has been GREAT. Prior to using the medication, I would get depressed for weeks/months and couldn't deal stress but now I don't have the extreme lows (highs & lows). It keeps me on an even keel. 

I also had a bit of anxiety going into public places where there were large groups like bars or parties. Now, I don't feel so fearful. The difference is I may not like to go BUT I GO, rather than sit home.  

I recommend it for all to try. ONLY side effect I noticed was 20 lb weight gain & not being able to lose it even when I am eating right and going to the gym.

It took about 4-6 weeks for the side effects to dissipate. Totally changed my life. Eleven years later I do experience some emotional ""numbing"", but I'll take that over the very low lows I experienced with PPD. Additionally, I think I have always been low-key depressed even in my 20s. It def runs in my family.

I feel like I'm operating at about 90% of my ""old"" self.  I didn't know if I'd ever feel this good again and I think Zoloft helped immensely with overcoming major depression and anxiety.  My symptoms developed about 4-5 years ago and I had tried everything:  therapy, supplements, dietary/lifestyle changes, not to mention about 10 different antidepressants (Paxil, Prozac, Lexapro, Effexor, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Fetzima).  I was afraid I was bipolar, or simply couldn't tolerate antidepressants, or that I was just screwed.  Zoloft has been a miracle for me.  I have slight nausea and that is it.  I take it in the morning.  Only 12.5mg and somehow that seems to be enough.  I'm shocked.  Don't give up!!  Keep trying until one works - there are a lot of them out there.  "

Overall it took more than 2 years to get back to ""normal"" after taking this medication.

Started and stopped several times thinking oh I will be fine without it. But no! 2 days after missing my dosage of 200mg I cant even carry on a normal conversation without being irritated . I broke down crying over things I used to be able to just let it fly buy , and to watch the news even brought me to more tears. I wasn't interested in anything , no housework done, errands, regular outings nothing! I went back on my 200mg dosage and after 2 days I was back to myself again....But don't forget about the major withdrawal symptoms I experienced during the time I thought I don't need to take my meds. Dizziness, unable to eat, my stomach hurt if I ate or didn't . Then I couldn't keep nothing down. I was so tired stayed in bed for days. I have now realized I can't live a happy life without it. But it took me at least 10 years fighting back to accept the facts. So listen to me, give it time to work, It wont work instantly. When I stared I was at 25mg...Now at 200mg....Life is good today and my future is prosperous.

I was getting bad nausea and abdominal pain as my doctors said I would, but I also had extreme insomnia. I was lucky if I got 2-3 hours of sleep a night over the week and half period. And when I did finally fall asleep, I woke up often. I also had extreme fatigue and hardly had the energy to walk about my house. It also caused some slight tremors and made my blood sugar drop dramatically. I also began to to develop ulcer-like sores on my tongue and gums.
593$Depression$5/11/2016 11:34:31 PM$Reviewer: dressedtorepress, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$This drug really helps with my depression. While I'm thankful that my mood is stable, the heartburn, constant state of sleepiness, and unquenchable thirst (dry mouth) really are hard to deal with. The heartburn happens about once or twice a month and comes with no known triggers as I take the pills with the same snack at the same time everyday. It's very uncomfortable to the extent that I had believed it was far more severe than heartburn at first. I'm constantly able to fall asleep no matter how much sleep I get. Possibly, Zoloft just makes me too tired to be sad. I suppose the drug is doing what it's meant to do: treat my depression. However, not having extreme heartburn for hours on end and never being able to feel fully awake are side effects I could do without. 
597$Depression$4/6/2016 8:36:58 AM$Reviewer: CJU, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I've been taking Sertraline/Zoloft for 5 years to treat depression.
I started at 25mg then to 50mg where I stayed for 3 years.
After a divorce I moved to 100mg for obvious reasons. For at least a year it seemed to do very well with crying episodes and overall getting through the divorce. Around the year mark the depression became much worse and I was extremely lethargic. I lost interest in everything, including friends and family. I wouldn't go on dates and it was all I could do to go to work. The odd thing was that I seemingly had everything a single person would want. A lake house, nice car, great job and my choice of who I wanted to date. 
However, people close to me had no idea that I became a recluse. They all assumed I was having the time of my life.
One morning I woke up and felt that I just couldn't take the pain anymore. I went to the kitchen, leaned over the sink with a large knife to my throat. While trying to decide if it would be better to instead cut my wrist, I stopped and called my doctor. I was surprised to hear her say to come right away to see her. When I drove to her office I was crying my eyes out because I hated who I had become. Thankfully my Dr didn't give up on me and actually up'd my dosage to 200mg. It honestly saved my life. I soon became depression free with the only side effect of still being lethargic. Also the dizzy brain zaps when I miss a dose.
I'm remarried and happy again, but always tired. My Dr. Has put me on a new medicine called Fetzima 20mg and has cut the Zoloft back to 100mg to help with the tiredness. So far so good after 3 weeks. I went through a few dizzy spells, but stuck with it and feel like my old self again.
If you or anyone you know has secluded themselves please know that there is hope. 
The first step is having someone who understands your sickness and that you don't choose to feel this way. 
The second step and hardest thing to do IMO is finding and then giving the medicine time to work. 
Best of luck."

Zoloft has made it to where I don't sleep for about 24 hours, then sleep for 14 hours, which is very inconvenient for everyone in my household. I break down hysterically sobbing for absolutely no reason, at completely random times. My overall mood has gotten slightly better, but I can't get happier than a certain level. I'm currently coming off of this medication, and it is hell. I'm nauseous and have a horrendous migraine which makes being near anyone difficult due to the sound and smells.

My MD suggested Zoloft. The starting dose was way too high so we backed off to 100mg a day. I know many feel that 100 is even a high dose, but it worked For me. I've been on a 100-150mg dose for 10 years (depends on need) and I can truly say it saved my life. I've had some side effects, but none bad enough to discontinue the med.
What I see in many of these reviews is concerning. Any med is going to take a while to get the full effect, especially anti-depressants. Stopping after a week because of an initial effect is not getting the full benefit. Give it a chance, it might actually work. Also, there are many factors that can cause these side effects I'm seeing: other meds, age, pre existing issues. Be careful and talk to your MD, there might be a good reason for side effects and maybe it's not the Zoloft.
I think it's a great med. Of course it's not for everyone, but when it works it's a godsend!
Good luck to you all; I know what you're going thru."

My moodiness, irritability, sadness, and anxiousness are much more controlable and I feel like I can cope with life now.  However, it is not without side-effects.  The first 3 weeks I had diarrhea and headaches, but not major enough to stop trying it.  After a month, the cloud lifted and I started enjoying life again.  Six months later, though, other side effects such as loss of libido crept in.  I have never had a problem maintaining my weight, and have always had a fast metabolism.

Everyone is different.I'm wondering if some of the problem is Dr's over medicating at the start. I have not had to up my dosage. My life is so much better since I started taking zoloft.No more crying about every little thing. It has been a life saver for me.Again may not be the same for everyone.I am now a young 80 yrs. old.

My day to day life has changed from a constant battle to a breeze. Now I finally feel my normal self again, I realise how anxious and depressed I was. I am a intelligent high functioning person that still got by on shear will power. I have been taking it 2 months and only take 3/4 of a 50mg Sertraline.
I am a different, relaxed, happy person. I sleep well, I think clearer, I want to do stuff again. Its amazing what this drug has done for me.

I started on half a tablet 25 mg a day and had major side effects, felt ill, got more depressed then ever, didnt sleep at all, felt sick, massive headaches, diarrhoea, very, very down, it was aweful...Just because some reviews told me to not give up and a supportive partner I pulled through...it took over 2 weeks to lessen these side effects and probably 3-4 weeks to really start to notice this huge dark cloud to lift..

START ON A LOW DOSE AND GIVE THIS DRUG TIME, DON'T JUDGE IT IN THE FIRST 2-4 weeks!!!

I took it before going to bed and woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, but freezing and shaking uncontrollably. My teeth were chattering too and I couldn't stop shaking. I was like that when I woke up in morning still and the rest of the day I called my doctor and told them about the symptoms and that I wasn't going to take it. No thank you.

710$Depression$4/24/2014 4:42:23 PM$Reviewer: Kate, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have struggled with an eating disorder, anxiety and very bad depression with suicidal thoughts for 4+ years. When I got to my lowest point I decided to try anti-depressants. Like most people, I was afraid that it would make me numb, emotionless, etc, but that didn't happen at all. I started out with 50mg a day. Once I had been taking them for a few weeks I already felt a difference in how I look at myself and other people (my family and boyfriend) noticed it too. Several months into taking Zoloft I hit a plateau. When I told my doctor that, she said that was very normal and upped my dosage to 100mg. The only negative side effect I have experienced is the night sweats ONCE IN A WHILE. Yes, they are uncomfortable and it's annoying to wake up feeling cold, but really clammy and sweaty, but the positive effects of the drug outweigh the negative sides in my opinion. My depression also interfered with my sleeping pattern. I would go through a couple days to a week or more of being so fatigued ALL the time and sleeping way more than I should, and then other times where I am so restless that I continuously toss and turn in bed and finally give up and just stay up all night. So, my doctor prescribed me Trazodone (helps with insomnia and is an anti-depressant) to take along with Zoloft. These two drugs together have worked very well for me regarding general depression symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, disordered eating, etc. 
711$Depression$4/22/2014 11:18:02 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$5$I was given this drug in order to deal with the death of my fiance. Once I took it, I was emotionless. I could not cry to save my life. That is not how I want to feel. I need to release this hurt and now it is being blocked. I feel strange. I know that the need to cry is there, but by it being trapped, it is making me anxious and jittery. I am able to sleep, but when I awaken, I feel distant. I feel like my body is not mine. I am not sure what the intended effect of this medication is suppose to be, but I do not like the way it makes me feel. I was given 50mg and told to start off with 1/2 (25mg). The 25mg seems to be too much for me. The day of the funeral, I know I was being looked at because of my lack of tears. They just would not come out. I was like a zombie going through the motions. I am trying to get a hold of someone to see whether or not I am able to get on something more balancing. I feel as though I am about to have a panic attack.

I'm smaller, so I got the lowest dosage (50mg) and cut that in half, so i was taking 25mg/day. I was fine for the first two weeks, but then when the third (this week) hit, my depression stooped to a new low. My arms are literally covered in really bad s/h cuts(more like gashes) and I tried to hang myself twice. If you are small and young, DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. It made me tired all the time to the point of hardly being able to function, and despite my huge appetite and constant eating I lost 5 lbs in TWO days. I went from 108 lbs to 103 lbs. I keep getting wicked headaches, I keep hurting myself, and I've seemed to lose all self control. Zoloft has made my life a living hell. It's terrible. 
745$Depression$1/16/2014 1:35:27 PM$Reviewer: Julia S., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$4$I was prescribed Zoloft for postpartum depression after my second child was born.  Within days I had awful side effects - sweats, chills, nausea, headaches.  I tried it for a few weeks and then went to my PCP.  She said that I'd have to quit nursing and go on tricyclics, and that breastfeeding wasn't a big deal, formula is fine.  Note to self: don't listen to PCPs when it comes to antidepressants!  For a new mom with PPD, that was the worst thing to say.  I went sobbing to my therapist, who promptly squeezed me in to see a psychiatrist.  She explained that each SSRI is different, and that we'd try meds until we found something that worked.  She switched me to Celexa immediately, and as I tapered off Zoloft, the side effects disappeared.  I did have problems when I came off Celexa, but the key is if one med doesn't work for you, try another - AND work with a good psychiatrist not a PCP when it comes to medication.

After 3 months and 100mg dose per day up from 50mg which didn't do anything, I started getting extremely extremely ill. Now, I will note that for about a month or so I felt a huge difference and It was effective in reducing my anxiety/depression however the side effects ending up being detrimental. I had to have an endoscopy (camera down throat to see stomach) to prove the medication irritated my stomach. Zoloft caused extreme nausea, no appetite. It was horrible, and I threw up for 2 months ever morning because I was taking the zoloft before I went to bed. Long story short, the drug caused excess stomach acid to build up, created irritation, and made me throw up for months and feel waves of nausea hit me like a brick in the middle of the day. After being off of it for 1-2 months my stomach is still not back to its normal calm state. I have switched to Remeron which so far is helping (very mildly) but with zero side effects! It is helping my appetite since the zoloft made me on the verge of being extremely underweight, and I was already thin to begin with. Also, I currently take ""lansoprazole"" which works wonders for me (prilosec doesn't work for me)it is a 24 hour acid reducer. Anxiety and Depression pills cause so many GI issues.

756$Depression$12/28/2013 3:48:02 AM$Reviewer: pharm free, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I have taken Zoloft twice, about five years apart, and while it did pull me out of a huge slump, it caused at least a 20 lb weight gain both times. I am normally average weight, sometimes leaning toward underweight, and I eat pretty healthily, although I do pig out here and there. But I have never been overweight. At least until Zoloft. I gained 20 lbs the first time, and almost 30 the second, and both times the weight was hell to lose. I've been off it for a year now and am back to my regular size, but it took 5 months of strict low-carb dieting and vigorous exercise to get to this point. And that was after 4 months of just being med-free and letting my body go back to normal. It screwed with my metabolism, and it takes a while to bounce back. It did help my depression, it just made me feel horrible about myself. I've been taking 100mg 5HTP daily for 7 months along with rhodiola rosea. For the first 2 weeks, 5htp made me sleepy, but now, it's better than Zoloft. And it curbs my appetite! I feel great and normal and I'm so happy to be off pharms and still feeling good. I'm passionate about my hobbies again, something that I still lacked even on Zoloft.

In and out of therapists offices and hospitals, but I refused to take anything until my last hospital stint. Zoloft has changed my life! I feel like myself again, and a feeling of sadness may last an hour or two instead of a year or two without. I'm going to stay on this drug for the rest of my life. I haven't noticed any weight gain or other lasting side effects, although I did lose my appetite at first, all is well now.

When I decided to reduce my dosage, that is when problems began. I began to suffer from total body weakness, joint pain, indigestion and irritability. I would never recommend this or any SSRI drug for anyone. I am learning about alternative means of dealing with the conditions that caused me to begin taking the drug in the first place.

846$Depression$6/19/2013 12:16:53 AM$Reviewer: raqueltio, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$Zoloft is the only medication that has worked for me. I have had on and off major depression and anxiety for 5 years and tried Remeron, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Trazodone and countless others. Zoloft was the best for me. Although it interferes w/my sleep, it works. I take Ambien CR and Klonopin/Clonazepan to sleep. Without Zoloft I would probably be dead or institutionalized.

And it has worked beautifully. I feel ten times better. No more sadness, suicidal thoughts, lack of motivation, none of that. The only negative about Zoloft or probably any antidepressant is that when you first start taking it you go down before you go up. Also the firsr month or so you will feel pretty mellowed out. Not down but not really up either. It's not a bad feeling it just kind of took me by surprise. But really after being on Zoloft for five months my life has drastically improved. It's worth a try.

If if it starts to disslove, you may experience (as I do) a strong burning felling on your tongue that will last about 30 min.

I think is only because SSRI's don't work. Zoloft is hard on my stomach, hard on the sex drive, doesn't help with my anxiety. Getting on it was unpleasant and I know if I have to get off it, like the others I will have withdrawal symptoms.

I was very tired and sluggish all the time, and had occasional bad days when I felt like I was just down in a hole and all I wanted to do was sleep.  Even on the best days I was chronically tired.  I often felt complete disinterest in my child, and I lost interest in my hobbies- riding my horses seemed like too much work, and I was way too tired to even consider exercising.

I also had trouble with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by even routine daily tasks.  I had a lot of irrational guilt as well.

Zoloft literally changed my life overnight.  I feel 100% normal, the way I did before I ever got pregnant.  1 50mg zoloft a day has worked wonders.  I was afraid I'd feel doped up but all I feel is normal.  I have my normal energy level back, I'm enjoying my baby, I'm riding my horses again, it's wonderful.

I was afraid after reading the bad reviews that this medicine would give me bad side effects, but so far  have not experienced any side effects at all.  I strongly encourage anyone suffering from depresion to give this medicine a chance- it might work just as well for you as it has for me.  I wish I had started taking it months ago.  "

1005$Depression$7/11/2012 5:29:20 PM$Reviewer: noscreenname, 35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$" I started taking Zoloft for help with deep depression. I also had a cocaine habit which contributed to the deep depressed state I was in. As a bonus it completely curbed any craving for cocaine. It was like Chantix would do for a smoker only it didn't take seven days to work. It worked as soon as the Zoloft took effect. I am not sure if any doctor has been made aware of this extra benefit. If not I hope a doctor or a pharmaceutical rep reads this and researches this so Zoloft can be used in treatment for addictive disorders as well as a treatment for depression.

It's hard to wean off of but I found that decreasing the dose very slowly helped. I could reduce to 50 mg with no problems and used that as my starting point. Then I would reduce the dosage by approximately 12.5 mg (by cutting the pills up) for each two-week stage. So it was 50 mg for 2 weeks, 37.5 mg for 2 weeks, 25 mg for 2 weeks,etc. I still had some dizziness but it wasn't quite as bad as when I followed the recommended protocol for weaning off!
1015$Depression$6/19/2012 6:34:21 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$This is the first anti depressant I ever took and my body's reaction to it should have been a warning for me against any meds. I took one pill, a very low dosage maybe 10mg, during a stay in a hospital psychiatric ward back in 2006. Soon after I began having very intense visual hallucinations. My doctor was notified at once and the medication stopped. He informed me that it was a rare, but serious, side effect of Zoloft and to never take it again because long term the hallucinations may become permanent. It seems my body is incredibly sensitive to psychiatric meds, especially anti depressants, as I have always had severe reactions to them. Eventually, I learned to work through my depression and anxiety and PTSD without the use of meds(therapy only) and am much happier now.

She just does not have Depression, she also had ADHD.   But I feel the Zoloft is not working, if anything making it worse..  Do Not let your children on this drug what so ever.  Does Not work..

It pulled straight through and out of a severe depression, but the drowsiness and effects it has on memory and concentration were I believe the cause of two very problematic things - first a car accident which if it weren't for the safety features of our vehicles, I and a family of 5 could have easily been killed.  Zoloft helped me through the storm of the insurance claims which could have easily spiralled me into suicidal depression...I had to get a new job to pay for the costs of the accidents and on my job due to the complaints of my new manager about my frequent mistakes and inability to remember important job procedures, I almost lost my new job, and unfortunately that is still a looming possibility.  I just think Zolofts side effects are now causing the types of problems that cause my depression, so I am going to switch to Wellbutrin and see if my situation improves.  Zoloft has been my best medical friend, but maybe not.

He doubled the dosage and it didnt help. I han irriable bowel symdrome and I gained 65 pounds.  I was hungry all the time.I finally had to make up stuff to see a psychiatrist and he said, if I had gotten to him sooner I would not have gained all that weight! I still have 50 pounds left to lose. The IBS has stopped and I was put on effexor and wellbutrin but that is not for everyone. See an expert for help in these medications.  It appears it was my dopamnine was a problem  not so much my seratonin.  Family doctors are not well versed in treating depression and the side effects  of these drugs. My psychiatrist gave me a new lease on life after suffering for years. However my friend took wellbutrin and became severely depressed but was better after quitting it.
So see an expert about psychiatric drugs!"
1028$Depression$5/26/2012 8:48:31 PM$Reviewer: countrygirrrl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$I was diagnosed with PTSD in April 2012. Anxiety & depression are part of this as well. My psych started me with 50mg Zoloft, 25mg Hydroxyzine for anxiety. Went back for my follow up, and didn't really see any significant improvements so he increased Zoloft to 100mg. Well the 100mg gave me the shakes in my hands really bad and it became unbearable, so I went back and he put me back on Zoloft 50mg then added 75mg Effexor XR. So far I am happy with this combination. I still get a couple of crying spells but not too bad. I noticed I am able to get through stressful situations and other things that would have previously had me through the roof with anxiety. You just have to find the right combination with your psych, it might take several meds to get your combo down but it can work if you give it a chance! :)

I noticed a positive difference within a week. It has a sedative effect, therefore has helped with my 'insomnia' that I have been battling for yrs. (I was probably depressed due to ongoing stressful issues for the past 10 yrs & did not realize it).Also am now taking Amytriptaline 10mgm @ bedtime if I need it.(this also helps with sleep).
I believe that it has lifted my mood (I felt tremendous sadness & hopelessness most days...& cried all the time).Zoloft (Sertraline) has helped me. I don't cry as
I did before, also have more energy to do everyday activities. Before the meds I did not feel like doing anything..could have stayed in my pj's all day..had no interest in anything. Now I have more energy & I am better equipped to deal with our high stress issues. My daughter has noticed a difference also. I do not like to be dependant on meds. but in my case, I feel it has been a dramatic change for the better. My doctor feels that I should stay on the Zoloft for 9 to 12 months...then we will discuss if I should stop. He suggested that I increase the dose, but I declined this for now because I feel better. I will also see a therapist. As for the weight..I have gained 3 lbs, too early to say I guess...but I think I get more enjoyment out of life now...I had lost my appetite before & had lost 4 lbs.As for my libido..it was not good before...now I believe I may be regaining some interest..probably too early to say.

I was feeling depressed but didn't know exactly what was wrong with me, I just knew that I was sleeping through EVERYTHING and was going through some hard times. I was on the medication for three years and it worked well, etc. 

I started taking the medication again after 4 years and there are some things about it that I do not remember from the first time around. The medication will give you very bad nausea if you do not take it regularly and with food so beware. However, this wore off for me after a few weeks. You also may have problems sleeping, but overall the reviews are very spot on. In just a couple of days you feel much better and have the motivation to not only stay on the medication but get other things done too! I'm not sleeping 24/7 anymore. However, also like the reviews I've experienced a lack of libido and in the past very very vivid dreams."

1130$Depression$11/7/2011 6:24:29 PM$Reviewer: glades, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$  Zoloft was the first medicine that had any real effect on my depression. It began to work with the very first dose and still prevents the chronic depression that has plagued me for the last 20 years. I take 100 mg each morning. Other than a significantly decreased libido, the only side effects that I am aware of was aggitation when I failed to take the medicine (Zoloft). I had much anxiety and the whizzes so I just got my prescription re-filled. My doctor has informed me that Viibryd might be just as effective as the Zoloft without the side effects that might happen with long term use of the Zoloft. I am very apprehensive about discontinuing a med that has worked so well?

The bad:  I gained about 25 lbs on this and lost it within 3 months after stopping it. Gave me a discontented feeling at night time like I felt like I always needed to be doing something but when I would do stuff I used to  enjoy I was uninterested. Made me hyper at times and act out of character. All these things made me get off of it after a year but it got me out of the depression and helped my social phobia so it worked."

1168$Depression$9/4/2011 7:03:29 PM$Reviewer: depressedanxious, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$5$I took Zoloft on and off for more than 10 years for a combination of major depressive disorder (which included insomnia) and social anxiety. It helps me feel less anxious and my sleep becomes very regular, however the reason that I quit taking it is because it makes me feel like a zombie emotionally and because of the sexual side effects. I would take it again if I became depressed, but it's not a drug that I could take long-term anymore; The side effects are not worth it. I have found that walking outdoors and writing in a journal works nearly as well on the depression, but doesn't work for my insomnia that much and does nothing for the social anxiety.

Was successfully TREATED FOR 2-3 YRS during that time went up to 150mg from 50mg start.  Then NO MEDICAL INSUR and health clinic wouldn't prescribe BRAND had to pay $50/mth to get it SO COULDN'T and stopped cold turkey (DON'T REMEMBER ANY HORRIBLE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS though).  This time started with generic at 25mg for ANXIETY (more prominent currently).  GREAT SEDATIVE SIDE EFFECT of sleeping for 12 hrs a day EASED my ANXIETY (pain in chest, lump in throat, rapid heartbeat, nervousness, can't focus on anything to get it done) but made me tired when awake and forgetful for those 1st 2 weeks.  THE DOSE FOR TREATING DEPRESSION IS 50mg so now on BRAND for last 2 weeks and have HAD TERRIBLE UPPER BACK PAINS AND SPASMS; right after took dose nightly got great ANXIETY but it subsided after an hour; NAUSEA right after dose (2 TUMS helps); has REDUCED my GREAT APPETITE (usually overeating is due to an imbalance in brain chemistry) and I'm able to make healthier choices at regular mealtimes (REDUCTION in impulsivity OCD); does help me SLEEP DEEPER at night (need at least 8 hrs)  but is DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF BED in the morning (quick 1 cup of coffee and ready to go though); body PAINS I suffer from past injuries are EASED during the night which is a another welcome side effect not having to use additional meds.  I see alot of bad sexual side effects from other users reviews but I'm here to say, as it was years ago, there is some loss of normal sensitivity but ORGASMS ARE VERY INTENSE once you get there. I also remember great euphoria effect from serotonin (that's what I'm aiming for again) can't say that has kicked in yet but do feel relief and LIFE SEEMS LIVABLE for someone who has battled depression/anxiety/OCD since late teens."

I have had depressed symptoms since my teen years and was first diagnosed with clinical depression at age 15, then at 17 I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I also have photosensitive epilepsy, which sometimes makes pretty down, so Zoloft helps that out. I think I've been on this medication now for about 4 or 5 years now. I have tried Celexa, Abilify, Remeron, and Effexor. Abilify made me go really quite well, psychotic and sick and Effexor stopped working after a while of being on it.

I noticed right away I was feeling better, mentally more calm and less stressed throughout the day when I normally am very stressed at work. I am really happy about that! I have been dealing with depression/anxiety/stress for 13 years since the death of my mother. I am an only child and always just very nervous/worried about my life in general, just unhappy. I was also sick with a virus when I began taking Zoloft, so I did feel bad from the sickness (the Dr thought I was sick from stress, but I am still recovering from a sore throat and still on antiobiotics and steriods too). I have been experiencing the jaw-clenching and waking up with my hair wet in the morning from having night sweats. I think I was talking in my sleep last night as if someone was in my apartment, but I live alone with my dog. I faintly remember having a conversation with someone, lol. Can someone will these side effects go away with further use? My teeth hurt from all of the jaw-clenching :( I so sleep better overall (I take Trazodone to help with sleep and this makes it work alot better because I was not sleeping very well with it before due to stress). I am overall happy with it so far, I just do not like the jaw-clenching and night sweats/talking. I don't want to end up sleepwalking or anything dangerous like that.

1251$Depression$5/10/2011 11:49:55 AM$Reviewer: KMP327, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$2$4$"I have suffered from a mild form of depression since I was a teenager, which I believe has been caused by being on various birth control pills.  I finally went off birth control several months ago and after a few months was still having significant PMDD, so I finally submitted to being put on a Zoloft prescription. I took a low dose (50 mg) and it really helped me with anxiety and depression, cutting the days of the month that I was depressed down from 5-7 to maybe a half a day or one day.

The problem was, I gained a LOT of weight (25 pounds in six months), despite working out 5-6 times a week and eating relatively healthy.  There were no changes in my diet or exercise, the Zoloft was the only thing that could be causing it.  If it was just five or ten pounds I could handle it, but I increased exercise and cut down on food intake and I was still gaining, and my doctor told me that it is a commom side effect and it would probably be very difficult for me to lose the weight while still on the medication.

I'm now weaning off the Zoloft because I want to try managing the depression with vitamins (first try will be fish oil and a B-complex).  I don't mean to sound vain but the weight gain was making me depressed as well as uncomfortable in my clothes and my own skin!

I hope this is helpful for someone who is considering taking Zoloft for PMDD - I think it's worth exhausting other options before getting on it because of the weight gain.  But if I don't find the vitamins and supplements helping I will get back on it, I've had no other side effects from it besides some mild dizziness from time to time. "

Not jumping up and down and screaming from the rooftops, but able to deal with life for the first time in 20 years.  To those who are experiencing suicidal thoughts, I highly suggest seeing a psychiatrist.  Drugs can't cure that alone.  Weight gain?  You need to exercise more and eat less.

I want to either stop taking it or switch to somethiing else.  Zoloft makes me have really BAD NIGHT SWEATS to a point where I have to change my clothes in the middle of the night because they are soaked with sweat and my doctor said there's nothing to help that. I also noticed a HUGE DECREASE in my sex drive. I hardly ever feel like having sex and when I do have sex, it either takes forever to climax, or I just don't climax at all.  I'm fed up with Zoloft.

I started on 50mg and have worked up to 150mg. It has taken almsot 5 weeks for me to finally feel a difference, but what a difference it is. There were days when I would stay in my sweats and just watch all tv all day. Now I'm finally feeling like myself waking up happy and wanting to actually do things again. It took a very long time to work for me, so be patient if you don't see antyhing right away. I'm glad I stuck with it. The only side effect for me is in the bedroom dept. Never been a problem before but having those ""fireworks"" now are near impossible or take FOREVER. But thats not the end of the world I guess. Otherwise I haven't had any other problems. I would like to move up to 200mg, but my doctor wants me to wait a bit. She kept telling me it takes time and I was starting to lose help, but finally I am feeling better. I would recommend this if you are thinking of tyring it. "

I hear electrical sparks in my brain, my vision is weird, eyes feel like I have saran wrap over them. I am photosensitive, can not be in the sun without burning like I am on fire, break out in a rash, itch and run a temperature. Two weeks of rash and itching, two weeks of shedding small flakes of skin, looks like I am molting. Leave dead skin all over the place.

I have not yet solved the problems that caused my depression, but I definitely feel more capable of dealing with them and moving forward and getting to a point where I no longer need the medication.  My wife tells me I am more connected, and more engaged with the world around me.  I believe that the depression had a greater negative impact on my sex drive than zoloft/sertraline.

His whole personality changed for the worse, his business failed, he became someone else and almost lost everything in his life. His doctor never asked anything more than how ya doing and kept rewriting the prescriptions. It was awful. He weaned himself off and we are back together and seeking therapy. The thing is, he couldn't see the changes in himself. He kept doing more and more risky behavior, including jumping out of airplanes and riding really fast on motorcycles. Just to 'feel' something. The same with the affair and prostitutes, it was more for the 'danger' and 'forbidden' feeling than anything else. It was a horrible 6 years and now he says he has a clarity he hasn't had in almost a decade. It scared the heck out of me that's for sure and our children still don't trust him after meeting his Mr. Hyde!

This was so severe, I couldn't hold down a sip of water or roll over in bed. My PCP sent me for more tests than I can remember. I was losing my mind.  The PCP, GI specialist & shrink said it couldn't be this drug. Even my gy/obn couldn't give me an answer. My stomach was distending. Why? No answer. I went on an out of town trip, ran out of my prescription, and within 3 days my symptoms of vomiting went from 15 to 5 times a day. This was 2000 or 2001.  It must have taken another 6 months before this side effect quit.  Research tells me the distention is one of the first signs of diabetes, which is rabid in my family. My doctor had my medical history. Research also said that children get diabetes due to excessive vomiting during a childhood illness!  So now I'm diabetic, more depressed because my remaining son died, will never take anything for depression and barely do anything a doctor tells me.  I wouldn't wish this on the devil. If I could star ratings would be in the negative.

1350$Depression$1/11/2011 11:35:16 PM$Reviewer: grumpyturnip, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Speaking only for myself all I have to say is Sertraline (generic Zoloft) SAVED MY LIFE!!! Once I got through the initial side effects and the dosage was in the appropriate therapeutic range my depression vanished. I don't feel like a spaced-out zombie! I feel like myself-the way I always thought I should feel before severe clinical depression got in the way. No problem dealing with the weight gain-I am alive and functioning and that is way more important than worrying about my size. Now I exercise regularly and have made new friends! I encourage those suffering from depression to speak with an appropriate health care provider to investigate the possibility of taking anti-depressants. Sertraline doesn't work for everyone but with a little patience perhaps the right meds can be found. The difference it makes might be very pleasantly surprising!

I have experienced very little in the way of side effects; the downside for me has been loss of libido. However, for something to help with the depression, it's worth it. I do have some unresolved symptoms - lack of energy (physical and emotional) mostly, but Zoloft has been very helpful in getting me back to a functioning level.
1361$Depression$1/3/2011 10:34:47 PM$Reviewer: emily, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$2$2$I started taking zoloft about 2 weeks ago and noticed the side effects right away. From the first day, I promptly took a nap the moment it kicked in. I am so tired all the time! I don't feel like I can ever get enough sleep and when I'm awake I feel like a zombie most of the day! The nausea has mostly gone away now (I did throw up on the 3rd day) but I also still have no appetite. I don't salivate for anything so its almost painful to try and eat anything other than yogurt or soft foods that go down easily. I took effexor some years ago and never experienced any side effects like this, but that drug made me crazy. Moodwise, this drug has helped keep me stable and stress free. I don't cry all the time any more and i no longer have suicidal thoughts. but will these side effects ever go away? the whole purpose of me taking this is to live a happier life so i can be productive and enjoy things again. the point is lost if all i ever want to do is sleep!

Celexa(40-60 mg) did help me some, but I seemed to kind of plateu in my progress after 6-7 months.  Since starting on the Zoloft there is a noticeable difference in my mood and ability to focus and concentrate.  I should also note that I'm taking Wellbutrin in combination with the Zoloft as I was with the Celexa.  I have not noticed any side effects form the Zoloft yet and, in fact, some of what were apparently side effects of the Celexa (dry mouth, heavy sweating) have disappeared.  I know everyone's biochemistry is different, but so far so good with the Zoloft for me!

The only withdrawal symptoms I experienced were a slight headache with minimal dizziness. Nothing that stopped me from doing my daily routine. It seemed when I was on the medication, I was always tired, never wanting to do or go anywhere because I never felt good physically. 
I began not to care about my hygiene or anything else in my life. I also had to rely on ex-lax for constipation not to mention, my sex life had completely diminished. But I was happy mentally, or at least I thought I was. Since stopping, I have lost weight because I am now moving my bowels regularly. I also regained 'feeling' down there and am happy to report, I have no trouble reaching climax. What's bizarre beyond comprehension is that it seemed as though Zoloft made me numb from all that mattered in life. I wish I had the words to describe how truly happy I am now that I stopped. It's like the ole' happy me is back .. and better than ever.  I wonder how many others out there now, were just like me, feeling happy yet not realizing that the medication was having a terrible effect on day to day events.
Good luck to everyone  :)"

I felt so bad for my husband because sex was our best test for compatability. After getting off Z. I lost 60 lbs. in about 1 yr. and became sexually healthy again. I would not take this drug for anything again. I now take Cymbalta. My depression is from being chronically ill since birth. I am now 58 yrs. and have been in chronic pain since I was 26 yrs. old. When I finally found a doctor that knew what he was doing he put me on an anti-dep., AM and PM, time released pain pills, and meds., for break through pain, we tried other parts of the puzzle but found this to work pretty well. I would give my right arm to not be in pain and not suffer from depression. Yes, the 2 go hand  in hand and I too have had people tell me it is in my head. Wrong. I now take Cymbalta and I love it. Yes, my sexual drive is1/2 of what itshould be but I don't know what to do about that.

It numbed any and all feelings, so I was unable to function as a ""normal"" human being.

It has been 7 years since I took Zoloft and I am STILL HAVING SEVERE NOSE BLEEDS. I have to take supplements so that I don't bleed to death!
These depression medications DO NOT FIX THE PROBLEM THAT IS CAUSING THE DEPRESSION and the Doctor's don't care, just as long as they can make their money from doling out these deadly prescriptions.
A lot of depression is caused by OUR DIET and some is caused by something TEMPORARY in our living conditions.
We--as Human Beings--need to take more control of our bodies and for our own health. There is so much information out there to help us, if a person would just look it up on the internet.
I think it is WRONG to BLINDLY TRUST a DOCTOR just because he IS a DOCTOR. after all, he is HUMAN, and he may have graduated medical school at the BOTTOM of his class.  He also may not be keeping up with all the NEW research--I personally have had several Doctors who DID NOT.
When are WE THE PEOPLE going to wake up and realize that we are being"" LEGALLY""-  ""MADE ILL"" -AND- ""KILLED"" by Doctors and Hospitals?
 My advice--DO NOT CAUSE YOURSELF MORE PROBLEMS BY TAKING ZOLOFT OR ANY DRUGS FOR DEPRESSION.
Find a Doctor who actually wants to treat the CAUSE of
your problem!!  Think about it--they CANT GET RICH IF THEY CURE YOU---they get rich if they can KEEP YOU COMING BACK!  COMMON SENSE!!

With the Zoloft I experienced a lot of fatigue and abnormally dulled emotion. I also gained 30 lbs. during the three months I was on Zoloft (while exercising regularly and maintaining my already healthy eating habits), which is why I finally went off of it. It wasn't until I stopped taking Zoloft that I realized how detrimental it was to my overall well-being and how little it actually helped my depression. The weight gain and constant fatigue caused my self-confidence to plummet, and on top of that it didn't stop me from falling into intense periods of desolation. It's still a struggle for me to get through every day with moderate depression, but it's better without Zoloft.

I have taken zoloft twice for depression in the last four years. (I do not suffer from anxiety attacks.) It has worked both times, though it takes awhile. The first few weeks it improves the quality of my sleep, and then it gradually lifts my mood until I am almost) my old cheery self. I am thankful for zoloft.  However, I have experienced some side effects:  first and foremost, diarrhea - which has slowed over time but still have some stomach irritation. (At one point the pharmacy switched generics and the diarrhea stopped completely.) Also, it has reduced my sex drive and ability to orgasm - my doc suggested I take a break from zoloft on the weekends and that has helped.(This could be a worse problem for younger couples with a more spontaneous sex life, but it works for us.) I have NOT experienced nausea, skin outbreaks, tremors. I am pleased with zoloft and feel fortunate that it has worked for me. It has helped my brother and my dad too. From reading the reviews, it seems that it is not as helpful for depression with anxiety. Also, I recommend patience when you first start taking it - it takes awhile to get the full benefit. I have recently added fish oil and aerobic exercise (Curves three days a week for 1/2 an hour) - and make sure I get as much light and sunshine as possible. It is important to socialize too - even if you have to force yourself. Good luck to all of you.

1575$Depression$5/19/2010 10:09:32 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$Side effects lasted about a week and then were completely gone.  Worked great initially.  I became calm (no more flying off the handle) enjoyed my kids so much and they me and my social anxiety was mostly gone.  I stayed on it through my first 2 trimesters of pregnancy and went off for the last (had many panic attacks of feeling that I wasn't able to breathe, partly because of pregnancy and magnified by stopping Zoloft cold turkey.)  Went back on it 3 weeks after daughter was born but it just never worked as well as it did previously.  I eventually started feeling very foggy and started having short term memory problems.  Adding 5htp and tyrosine helped.  The big thing too my appetite started getting out of control... thought about food constantly and craved sweets all the time which caused me to gain 10 lbs.  Went off of 50 mg cold turkey.  Have been off of it about 2.5 months.  Has been tough and very on and off.  Started taking 5htp and tyrosine and starting to feel more leveled out.  I read that long term Zoloft use can affect your metabolism.  I'm hoping I can lose some weight and won't hesitate to try antidepressants again if I really need them (hope I can lose some weight first though..) Great at first, but long term can have a weight gain a foggy thinking effect. Eventually would probably have to be enhanced by Wellbutrin or Ambilify especially with the foggy thinking.

I have noticed that I am much happier, but that could be situational.  I continue to take it because I've had the fortunate benefit of weight loss.  However, the downfall is that my skin is much worse.  I'm not certain it's the drug and don't see that anyone else has cited an incrase in breakouts due to the drug, but my skin used to be clear until taking this.  I went off of it for about a month and did notice that I felt much grumpier, felt the weight coming back on and miraculously my skin cleared up to perfection.  I guess it's a tough call.

It worked well for helping my mood, but it strongly affected my desire to have sex. My depression worsened six months into treatment due to extreme psychological trauma. The doctor increased my dose to 50 mg. I experienced my first ever manic episode at 30 years old. My doctor ordered me to stop taking it immediately. Since then, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Specified). I have been free from psychiatric medication for three years. Unfortunately, a steroid used for treating H1N1 induced a brief manic period in me as well. No more Zoloft for me now but bipolar disorder for life. I don't blame the Zoloft, though. Even though I hadn't had any other mood episodes, BPD runs in my family. I think the Zoloft just helped it come to the surface.

Long story short, I stopped myself from taking every pill I could find cuz I then had to remember that I have to take care of my baby.  So, I called a psych crisis line and they sent out the cops and paramedics.  Then they all forced me to go to the hospital and then after 4 hours, I was released.

1633$Depression$4/1/2010 9:57:22 PM$Reviewer: equsole, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Tried taking this several years ago when I was in my early twenties and it made my depression worse. I've been on several different antidepressants since then and when my last one stopped working I took some time off from antidepressants (about 7 months). My OB/GYN suggested Zoloft because it is the safest one to take for pregnancy (I'm not pregnant yet, but have been trying). Well, I took it for 3 days - started on 25mg and on the 4th day I woke up have a severe panic attack that lasted all morning. I decided not to take my dose that day and later in the evening I started having dizzy spells and visual disturbances (twinkling stars and black spots) followed by a migraine. Needless to say, I will no longer be taking Zoloft. Also, it is no worse or better to take during pregnancy than any other of the antidepressants available; like most antidepressants it is riskier to take it during the last trimester...and knowing how bad the withdrawal symptoms are for this drug, I would not think this is a good drug to take during a pregnancy. I am experimenting with herbal supplements right now - I highly recommend wild oat extract (from Bach), a raw B-vitamin complex, and fish oil extract (high quality).

1662$Depression$3/14/2010 9:47:03 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$3$I have find my self more calmer,not worrying,stress free but i also find my self fidgit, when doing a busy task like at work i need a break when i felt like this,than I'm all good after the break. is it because i smoke cigrettes and i just had the erdge,but other then that i love the way zoloft my me feel i had no side affects and i felt good most of the time taking it. but sometimes i had to remind my self to take zoloft cause i took them at night time they made me sleepy any other time so i decided to take it at night at the same time.and i still had great results,im currently not taking the drug right now i stop about 6 months ago, but im consider to start back taking zoloft and remain on it, cause i find myself back in the same feelings before zoloft. so my main point is if any one is taking zoloft or use to take it and you not to happy. remain on the medicine or start back taking the medicine.your doctor knows whats right for you and if it dont make you feel better let your doctor know right away, they can help you with something else,what ever we do in our life being depressed and suffering from it.is not the answer. get help and live your life free from depression. you will be more happier more content and free. we only have one life to live, live it to the fullest without suffering from anything.

Before Zoloft I had tried many different meds, none worked as well as zoloft does. I take 200mg everyday and another medicine for anxiety it's grerat being independant again and able to hold down a job and take care of my child like a mom should. before I found Zoloft my life was a mess it's still one day at a time but it is well worth it. as far as side effects go I did notice headaches some in the begining but over time side effects went away. I don't ever want to change meds again. Zoloft is not for everyone just like prozac wasn't for me it made me ill and mean if you Zoloft is right for you you will be able to tell i think within a month of being on it it was like night and day after i got to full strength dosage. I went from sleeping all the time and forgetting to eat for days to living a healthy normal life. If other meds have not worked for you i would reccomend trying Zoloft at least once to see if it is what you need.

I am no longer angry, stressed, nervous, and depressed all of the time. People actually describe me as laid back! It not only helped my depression but pretty much did away with my constant anxiety. I have friends now, a great fiancee, I speak in front of people, and hold a managerial position. All of these things would have been impossible in my previous condition. The only unfavorable side effects I have experienced are tiredness and loss of sex drive. For those reasons I went from 100 mg to 50 mg and the side effects improved.

First I started at 50mg and had it increased to 75mg because of lingering depression symptons. I have to admit that I feel great since starting this medication. Im still not 100% but it's getting there. The only side effect that I've found is that I have crazy lucid dreams which I actually don't mind as long as they aren't scary but that is rare. This morning I actually woke up laughing because the dream I was having was funny. I only wish that the tablet came in 75mg dose instead of having me break a tablet in half every morning to get the extra 25 mg.

1701$Depression$2/10/2010 11:37:39 PM$Reviewer: Ronsword, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I feel like the odd man out as most reviews of Zoloft seem to be very positive. I'm not knocking the drug, but have to report on my experiences with it; they were awful. About one week after treatment on 50mg, I started developing tremor and felt very agitated. The jitters were bad---feeling like I'd just drunk 5 cups of coffee. Side effects worsened and after 3 weeks, I experienced really bad anxiety, like nothing I'd ever experienced before. It was as if a part of my mind was spinning out of control and I was helpless to do anything about it. It was clearly a bad reaction to sertraline because I've never in my 53 years experienced that type of bizarre anxiety. I know full well what panic attacks are, and I've dealt with varying degrees of anxiety for decades. But this was completely new to me and scared the living hell out of me.  After switching to Celexa, my side effects almost immediately abated and my depression lifted within several weeks of therapy. So the moral of the story, obviously, is that everyone's brain receptors work differently, there is no test to determine the best drugs for those receptors, and so careful monitoring and switching of drugs when called for is the best and only course of action.

negative thoughts I use to have running continuously in my head. I don't think it has dulled my emotions. But, it has had a large negative effect on my sex drive. Hardly any desire though i am
over 70. I tried going without it for awhile but I started getting
the weird brain sensations from the lower Serotonin levels.
  Also the negative tapes started running again. 
So, the last 15 years have been much more enjoyable. I
would do it again.  The only thing comparable for me would
be Valium.

I started using opiate painkillers at age 14 and injecting opiates iv including heroin when I was 16. I tried to get off of opiates for 6 months by myself and finally decided to see a shrink. I was very depressed without opiates scaled 8/10 and anxiety on a level of 11/10. The shrink put me on zolft 50 for withdrawls and did nothing the first 2 days. on the third day of taking zoloft I got terrible cold sweats (along with opiate withdrawl cold sweats), and was sleeping less then before. I began getting 2 hours of sleep max, and I felt like a zombie. about 5 days after I stoped opiates, and started zoloft I started on suboxone (which is specifically for opiate withdrawls). my depression seemed to get better but I was still a zombie and was still very anxious. I stopped taking zolft after about a month and just taking suboxone. my depression and anxiety disapeared aswell as my night sweats and sleep problems. but the withdrawls from zolft were very scary and would creep up on me. all of the sudded I would get a crazy tingle down my arms and through my hands, I would get these 'brain zaps'like an electrical shock through my brain where I would blurt weird noises unintentionally. I would get about 10 'brain zaps' a day and were very very frightening. the brain zaps slowly disapated but I stil get them when falling asleep maybe once or twice a week. I have been off zolft for 2 months now and i am still having withdrawls. I will never take an anti-depressant again EVER! Beware of this med. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!

After a traumatic experience in 2006 I was to the point in my life where suicidial thoughts were scaring me. I started Zoloft and after 2 or 3 weeks I started to feel better. Started with 50mg then went to 100mg.I just recently went up tp 200mg. I never have had any side effects from Zoloft. No weight gain. This may sound strange.... I realized one night sitting there watching TV, I was laughing at a show. Mind you I never found much amusing. I thought to myself Oh my gosh I just LOL!It was then when I realized that I was going to be okay. So those of you wondering about Zoloft, it's a personal choice but one I'm happy I did :)

1839$Depression$11/9/2009 11:48:30 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I was diagnosed with recurrent major depressive disorder and PTSD four years ago.  The cocktail that saved my life included Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Klonopin.  After years of cognitive therapy and EMDR I remembered how enjoying life felt, returned to practicing law, and dropped down to Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I started sliding recently and needed to add another antidepressant, so I went with the generic form of Zoloft due to Cymbalta's cost.  I got what I paid for.  Yes, I can at least grit my teeth to keep the tears back till I get home now, but the veil/grayness is still there.  I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone with severe, major depression - it's not adequate for the task.  I lost two more months of my life to the wretched disease, depression waiting for relief that never came.  I'm transitioning back to Cymbalta - my happiness is worth the expense.

After starting on Zoloft for around 2 weeks at 50ml/day and working up to 150ml/day over a 2 month period, I can only say I've experienced the results I have prayed for over the last 10 years. I thought I would never find my way out of the darkness of my life until Zoloft.

It took about 4-6 weeks to really start working but it has definitely been a huge help to me. The past 2-3 weeks my symptoms have started returning, but so is winter, which is probably a big factor in the return of my symptoms. My doctor increased my dose to 100mg and I'm hoping it will make a difference. The only side effect I have noticed is night sweats, which have gotten better with time, but they are not severe and certainly manageable. I have not had any nausea or intestinal issues. I have a lot more energy and am finally starting to feel like myself again after years of struggling with depression.

1849$Depression$11/3/2009 4:55:33 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I've been taking the generic (Sertraline) 25mg daily for around 2 yrs.  The reasoning behind beginning this was that depression runs in my family and also due to my job changing as I began traveling and living on the road.  I know there are others out there with similar conditions.  I am impressed with the drug but do see it for what it is as a band-aid.  It helps but does not correct the real root problem.  Prior to taking this I had never taken anything on a regular basis. My way of dealing with depression was with exercise and being out doors.  Now once again I am in a more controlled work environment and home everyday.  Soon I will begin regular exercise and discontinue use of this drug.  It has served its purpose well but I do not want to be dependant on anything except for food, water and shelter.  Only drawbacks that I have noticed are if I miss a dose - irritability and some anger but not depression??

I get worse around my period, and almost can't function in late winter.  I actually feel like I know I am supposed to feel on this medicine. NORMAL!! Anxiety, depression, major PMS, anger.. GONE! My patience, and concentration is a lot better too.  I am on the lowest dose, but I'm a small person, also, my doc did a blood draw and I was slightly anemic and low on Vit D.  So I am taking supplements for that. That may be helping me feel better too.  I had side effects the first few weeks, but nothing that wasn't tolerable.  BTW, I did go off this last year cuz I was feeling so much better, but when winter came, all the bad stuff came back and never went away.  I'll stay on it a little longer this time and hopefully get off and stay happy and normal... one day...

Been taking it for about 3 months and have had maybe 6 really bad days with nonstop crying I couldn't control, increased anxiety, extreme anger and irritability. Had to leave work once because I freaked out, couldn't stop crying, couldn't stop having really negative thoughts, I was angry, would have spat fire at people if I could, and had an urge so strong to hurt myself that I was afraid to be alone. It happened out of the blue and I still don't know why, maybe hormonal. Most days are good though. I was really weary about medicating for depression but most days it really helps. I have had an increase in appetite that led to some weight gain, a little trouble sleeping and now my dreams are so intense, and real that a lot of times after awaking from 8+ hours of sleep, I don't feel rested at all.

It worked great in the beginning; however, it by far has the worst side effects such as weight gain, fatigue, loss of sexual interest.  I did take this while I was pregnant and my son who is 15 months old shows NO signs of any birth defects and/or side effects.  I am told it is one of the safest drugs to take during pregnancy.  I have recently been weaned off of Zoloft and switched to Wellbutrin - the withdrawal is a horrible process.  It was very hard to go thru withdrawl, work 40 hour work weeks and come home and be a mom and wife.  It lasted about 2-3 weeks and the withdrawl effects are severe anxiety, vertigo, severe mood swings and fatigue.  If you're considering this medication, seriously read up on it before taking it.  It does what its supposed to do, but are the side effects really worth it??

I am currently on 100mg in the morning plus clanezapam at .25mg in the morning and afternoon.  My depression kicked in the summer of 2008 when I moved to a new home and started a high stress job that I did not choose.  On top of that I was diagnosed with a heart condition that will most likely result in a valve replacement surgery down the road. I also went through about 2-3 months of therapy.  I am a totally different person today.  I was never socially active and I was having frequent panic attacks.  It is strange when you look back at it how you are in a deep hole and you fear that you will never get your life back.  I have gotten my life back with the help of Zoloft.  I highly recommend it to anyone suffering the same issues. You have to have faith and belief that you will overcome your depression.  It was hard at first getting out to do normal everyday things.  I forced myself to get out and do chores outside and my family was a great help.  I did try other drugs at first and Zoloft was my life saver. I plan an taking the rest of my life because I never want to be the person I was before, always anxious and never wanting to be around other people.

1899$Depression$10/3/2009 11:58:33 AM$Reviewer: wilkyseven, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"This is a great drug for depression and anxiety but if you ever want to have a orgasm again without popping a vessel in your head by trying so hard, good luck. I took 100mg of Zoloft for seven years and for the most part felt great. The only side affect for me was how my doctor put it ""I couldn't get mt ticket punched during sex"". This simply would not do for me. Coming off the drug is difficult but can be done. Just ween yourself each week you are taking it to smaller doses by cutting the pills. You will get an strong feeling of dizziness and disorientation but it does pass within a short time. Maybe 2 weeks or so. Once u get past that point u will be fine. I now take Wellbutrin which does everything the Zoloft did minus the sexual side affect. Good luck people and if u want off this drug it isn't easy but it can be done. Just hang in there. I'm really proud of everyone who are taking steps to make their life happy and fulfilling for them and their family.

Oh one other thing...If u decide to switch drugs from one that isn't working for you to another you and your doctor want to try, it was my experience to ween yourself off the first drug a little before starting the new one. I told my doctor about my side affects with Zoloft and he immediately wanted me to start Celexa without getting some of the Zoloft about of my system....HUGE MISTAKE...don't do this...Cut your Zoloft dosage down to almost nothing then start the new one. When he had me just switch from one to the other within a day that really screwed me up. Just a word of advice.

1912$Depression$9/24/2009 6:48:43 PM$Reviewer: oldthymegal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been taking Zoloft for 16 years for severe clinical depression, which runs in my family. I was actually contemplating suicide because of my inability to cope with some difficult circumstances. Zoloft literally saved my life. I take 200 mg every evening and do experience some sedation with it, also have had weight gain. But overall, I have had excellent results with this medicine.  Have tried generics - some work pretty well, some don't. They all have different ""fillers"" in them, and some pharmacies (especially the big mail-order one) do tend to buy the cheapest ones. I got one (made by Cobalt out of Canada) that I was actually allergic to.  It also had absolutely no effect as far as controlling my depression - I cried for 2 weeks on it - went back to brand Zoloft and was better in 2 days.  So if you have to take generic for insurance reasons be sure you get it from a reputable pharmacy and ask them what generics they use(there are lots for Zoloft).  When you find one that works for you, ask your doctor to always specify that particular generic when he writes your prescription. Best advice is to get a generic from a US company, as quality control standards are monitored better here. My experience has been that brand Zoloft is best,and it's worth the additional cost if you can manage it. I believe this medicine has been God's way of healing me from depression so that I can live a productive life, and I am grateful for it.    "

1916$Depression$9/21/2009 11:39:30 PM$Reviewer: seankonnery, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I started with 50 and now up to 150 mg. I plan to go up to the max of 200.I had suffered from depression and anxiety for over 8 years until I discovered this drug! This is the first time I have had any relief from my condition. There were side effects the first two weeks but mostly gone now. I still clench my teeth now and then. One side effect is good for our sex life: I am not as anxious about missing sex, and I don't have pre-mature ejaculation at all. Overall my drive has decreased, which is a good thing, really. I could be quite overwhelming at times. I was heavily addicted to pot from 14-32 yrs old. This drug has a little similarity which makes it easy for me to know how to use it to gain peace of mind and calmness without getting bothered my the spaced-out feeling I get from it sometimes. It's a hell of a lot better than yelling at my kids, wife, and being nervous about everything, guilt feelings, etc. I still am pulling hair out of my head, literally, and very disturbed about disappointments in my life right now, which is why I'm going to the max 200mg in about 2 weeks time. But my life is a VAST improvement with this drug. Thank G-d and my nurse practitioner!

I took 50 mg for 15 years. Because of anxiety my md raised it to 100 mg. Because of chronic gastrointestinal problems she raised it again -- and it worked!  [Did you know your gastrointestinal track produces 95% of the total serotonin in your body? I didn't but have since investigated.]  We truly do have ""gut feelings."""
2001$Depression$8/7/2009 9:02:03 PM$Reviewer: megatha427, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I tried this after having a mild allergic reaction to Celexa, and the same thing happened.  I did not go to the ER this time because the reaction side effects were the same as the Celexa; I just took Benadryll, waited for them to subside, and went to bed.  My chest felt tight and my throat felt tight too, although it did not close up.  No rash or anything.  I have eczema and the ER doctors told me the first time that may have something to do with my reaction.  I have since been to 3+ psychiatrists and everyone is stumped about my reactions.

Love it! I was taking tegretol xr for a few years and it stopped being effective for me. Zoloft eases my anxiety and my moods are stable. It doesn't make me tired nor did I gain weight. It also did not make me feel overly giddy, it makes me feel just right however it did upset my stomache in the beginning. Also, I've seen some posts about singulair which I have been on for 8 years without any anger outbursts.

I have gone over a month with out sexual urges...and you can guess the strain that puts on a relationship. So in my opinion, you have to weigh your priorities, zoloft does work, but at what price. Living with depression is hard enough on a relationship and to add an almost non-existent sex drive...that just spells disaster...believe me I know.

Then a couple weeks later I started having severe mood swings almost like a mania..I was angry at everyone and everything...for no reason at all. I had no weight gain or any other side effects but requesed to be taken off of it because I was becoming fearful of hurting myself or others.

The medication does not make you feel better rather it simply deprives you of emotion.  I was no longer as anxious but I hardly felt happy about anything.  My doctor moved me up to a 100mg dose after 4 months and this was terrible.  I began sweating uncontrollably, dry mouth worsened, appetite was non existent, and I had prolonged ejaculation.  The drug will ruin your libido and leave you feeling more insecure then when you started taking it.  Avoid high doses, side effects were very present.

But the weight gain is very counter-productive, the last ting you need with Depression is more negitive feelings (unwanted extra weight). Side effects list 'loss of appetite' but I see from all the patient reviews weight gain is a common factor. This needs to be addressed, like I said compounding a depression is a harmful situation.

If a car alarm went off or a door slammed I jumped out of my skin. My feelings were easily hurt and I also felt paranoid, as if everyone was against me.  I stopped taking the mediation and  already I feel normal again. I haven't smiled for along time and forgot what having a good time was.  Even my animals noticed something was wrong with me.  After becoming combative with my new husband, I knew it was time to stop!!     
2115$Depression$6/5/2009 4:57:37 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $2$1$4$"I was prescribed Zoloft at 17. I took it for depression up until a few months ago. I’m turning 32 next week. Just to make that point perfectly clear, that it’s been 15 years.?
I stopped Zoloft for about a year in 2003. At this point, I weaned off of 75mgs over the course of a month. I experienced all the typical withdrawal symptoms (both verified and unverified by the drug companies). These included “brain zaps”, faintness, nausea, severe rage/aggression (almost violent), crying fits, etc…  The withdrawal symptoms went away after about six months. I noticed that my compulsion to drink alcohol went away (and therefore the weight that I had gained), as did the zombie feeling. I had been on this for so long that I thought it was all normal! I actually started to feel things again, sans “Garden State”. I actually wanted to experience life. 
Unfortunately, I had to start taking it again within a year due to unexpected hardships. Within weeks of taking Zoloft again, the zombie like existence returned, as did the compulsion to drink, weight gain, etc. At this point, I realized for the first time that it was the drug that made me feel this way (crazy how it distorts your thinking). 
 I stayed on Zoloft for another six years because I was terrified of the withdrawal, and what it would do to my job and personal life if I tried to stop again.
I finally stopped taking Zoloft again about a month ago. I suppose being laid off is as good at time as any to kick a bad habit. ? I followed the same process for weaning of it. I had the exact same symptoms as the last time; “brain zaps”, faintness, nausea, severe aggression (almost violent), crying fits, etc. I’ve been off it for two months now, and I still have all the withdrawal symptoms. I don’t, however, have the “zombified” feeling, compulsion to drink alcohol, negative sexual side effects, or lack of interest in daily activities that used to accompany Zoloft for the last 15 years.

I knew that I needed to get on medication. It allows me to be a Better Me and enjoy my life more fully. I don't have the Ups & Downs like I did in the old days. Now I feel more even, more steady.

Most all my friends I had known for years had passed on and I put this worry on me.I was not sleeping at night,lay awake and crying till I could not cry.This has made me relax at night,as I take 40mg. at my dinner time. I found this time was better for me. I am not drelling on my love ones leaving me behind. I have more to think about that benifet my needs.I look forward to going to bed at night and no more crying.I'd advise anyone depressed to check with their doctor right away.

2118$Depression$6/2/2009 11:03:06 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $5$5$5$I have been taking 25mg for a month now, and notice a big difference, I still get angry, but seem to be able to forget about it faster and not let it bother me.  My overall mood is just better. I do have to take it in the evening with my dinner, couldn't take it in the am, just made me way too tired!!!  but nighttime does the trick. It took 3 weeks to get over some side effects, so just stick with it, it does work!!! and the side effects will go away. Just give it time and keep your starting dose as low as possible. I still have a few side effects just vivid dreams is the most dramatic.  No weight gain at all, being a nurse I do see that once patients start to feel better on any medication, the first thing people usually do is gain weight, so make sure you are not consumed by the thought of maybe gaining weight.  I am very happy I have started Zoloft and hope everyone else get the same results I have, I feel 100% better!!!!!  Great for PMS!!!!!

The only awful thing was that I could not orgasm no matter how hard we tried. That really put a strain in that department so I went off of it just for that. (I was on a 25mg dose) So now that depression has come once again, I decieded to look into natural methods. I would suggest looking up information on supplements such as SAM-e, 5-htp, and L-tyrosine.  Almost all of the reviews on line have been positive, with NO side effects. I've been taking the SAM-e and after about 8 days worked just as good as the Zoloft with NO side effects.  I just got the other two and will start slowly with them as well.  Best part is they are all nattural!! I would for sure talk to your doctor before starting them and you should always wien off slowly from zoloft and under doctor supervision.  And I only recommed this for mild cases of depreession. Im no doctor, just putting it out there for those of you who are sick of the side effects.  worth a try.

Although I did seem to feel a sense of ""longing"" or desire (not sexual) which normal folk seem to take for granted.  Before on this, one of the only things daily that offered comfort was singing.  Zoloft made me not want to sing anymore...maybe though cause I usually sing to the same album every night lol (ocd?).  This could have been somewhat of a positive though in terms of OCD, i got tired of the things i was doing on a daily routine for the past couple years which i would normally call my ""comfort zone.""

The mood swings are aboslutely horrendous when trying to get off it. I give up trying to quit and start taking my regular dose again. Absolutely no sex drive. Could care less if I ever have it again. Grinding teeth is one side effect that has cost me a lot in dental work due to cracked & chipped teeth. I've noticed the numbness in my hands but never related it to the drug. Guess I didn't know it was a side effect. I feel great when taking it. It definitely worked with the depression. Now the hard part is trying to get off it.

Also, I have lost all the motivation and inspiration that I used to have. I've found that I don't really care about anything. I'm merely walking through my life, not feeling, not seeing, or experiencing anything. Zoloft has not been a good drug for me, but I know that it does work for other people. Like anything, it's not perfect, and I've heard of just as many people who like it as people who don't like it.

- Everyone reacts differently.  Just because someone had a negative experience on this board does not mean you will.  I did not experience nausea, anxiety, sleeplessness or lethargy.  Others have.
- Start out slowly.  Your doc should put you on a lower dosage and slowly increase it over time.  This helps your body get used to it with less side effects.
- Be patient...it takes 2-3 weeks to kick in.  So you might not feel any benefit until much later on.
- It doesn't change who you are.  That was my fear.  I didn't want a happy pill.  It did lift my depression so I saw things more clearly.  I am still the same person. However, if you had life problems before this pill won't make them go away.  It will help you to deal with them for effectively by making you functional."

I STARTED WITH A LOW DOSE ONLY 25MG FOR 8 DAYS THEN 50MG FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS, FELT GOOD FOR THE FIRST 5 DAYS THEN THE SIDE EFFECTS STARTED. I COULD ONLY SLEEP FOR 2 OR 3 HOURS A NIGHT, IT MADE ME FEEL VERY NERVIOUS AND GAVE ME PANIC/ANXIETY ATTACTS(NEVER HAD THOSE BEFORE), DRY MOUTH SO BAD I COULD FEEL MY THROAT SWALLOW ALL DAY LONG, MADE MY EARS POP EVERYTIME I SWALLOWED, AND FOOD WAS DIFFICULT TO SWALLOW- THIS WAS TERRIBLE.

2217$Depression$4/6/2009 11:59:59 PM$Reviewer: happy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$2$Zoloft had been most effective at the beginning of treatment, feeling better after the first 48-72 hours. Happier thoughts, more outgoing and less anxiety in front of groups, more desire to be social. Some side effects are nausea even when taken with food in the morning, tiredness for about 1-2 hours after taking the medication. And the worst is weight gain even when maintaining a healthy moderate diet and exercise. I gained about 12 pounds in 6 weeks. Finally, feeling better and gradually off the drug with hopes of loosing the weight and staying healthy. I would recommend this drug in low dose for short term.

I have been on Zoloft for a month now. It help my depression but I have gained alot of weight from it.  I do feel sleepy most of the time.  I also do not have any motivation to do anything.  I called my Dr to see if I could drop my dose down.  I was taking 50mg now I take 25mg I hope to get off this drug in the near future.  For people who want to stop this drug Cold Turkey dont do it.  I have read where the withdrawals are worst doing it that way.  Always talk to your Dr before stopping/ starting any meds.  "

2240$Depression$3/24/2009 10:05:03 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$3$5$"This drug has been kind of a double-edged sword for me.  It makes me feel physically better, but it doesn't really help me get back to feeling ""happy"".  In fact I really don't feel much at all.  It has kind of just numbed all of my feelings, I guess is the best way I can put it.  I still think about everything that has made me angry and depressed quite often, and I know I should be really tore up and distressed, but I just don't feel it.  Which isn't a bad thing I suppose.  It's a much better mental state to be in than moping around and sobbing all the time.  I still don't really feel motivated to succeed or care about anything all that much, but at least now I don't feel like laying in bed and crying all day.  I am able to get up in the morning and try to put forth a LITTLE effort to acheive some form of productiveness during the day.  However, concerning my little ""not caring"" trend, my grades are in serious trouble and are declining rather swiftly.  It is very difficult to focus and pay attention to lectures some days.  Use with extreme caution if you are a student in school as this medication could pose a threat to your GPA.  The only physical side effects I have experienced so far are trouble sleeping, extreme jitteryness (esp. in the hands/legs), light dizzyness spells (standing up/driving), and weight loss.  I haven't really lost my appetite but I feel energized all the time.  I've started running and working out almost daily which would explain the slender and trim new me.  That's really what comes to mind when I think of this pill.  Weight loss lol.  Not complaining though.  The quality of life for me may not necessarily seem better while on this drug, but it has made it bearable and a little brighter.  Hope this helps."

Instead of feeling horrible/suicidal, you feel mostly nothing. DO NOT quit taking abruptly, nausea and malaise worse than you can believe; absolute disorientation and crazy mood swings. If you must, gradually decrease every two weeks by 25-50 mg. Oh, and don't even think about having sex, as ejaculation is nearly impossible. Cheers and good luck!

Was taking it in the mornings but I was so tired during the day and wide awake at night. I tried to wait it out but finally realized I couldn't live in the sleepless fog i was in. So i switched it up and take it in the evening now. It is so much better now, still tired but nothing like it was.  I have also gained weight, from eating all day to stay awake, but now i just mentally have to stop the eating. So far so good.

I tried to come off it once and switch to Wellbutrin XR to improve sex drive, however I had severe side effects on Wellbutrin and went back on Zoloft after about a month. I swore that it would be the last time I'd come off Zoloft, but about two months later I became pregnant and vowed to be off ALL medication except prenatal vitamins. I am struggling a great deal with my depression now, but I am finding comfort in knowing it is all for my baby.  As soon as I give birth I plan to go back on Zoloft IMMEDIATELY.
2316$Depression$2/10/2009 1:02:31 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"I started on a very low dose (25mg) 6 yrs ago, gradually incr'g the dose over time. (I'm sensitive to medication and was apprehensive to start tx, but so desperate for help, I was willing to try). Soon after starting tx, I developed a constant,low-grade head ache. It differed from the usual type of headache. It was a dull, heavy- feeling of pressure in the front of my head. I actually had the feeling that the drug was working on the part of my brain not functioning properly. I took comfort in that, and actually felt that it was fixing the biochemical ""snafu"" in my head. Once the head ache was gone(usu. lasted 3-7 days.), I felt fabulous, happy, and peaceful. My initial symptoms returned in 3-4 wks,& my dose was incr'd to 50mg. This pattern repeated itself consistently over the next several mths,w/lenghtening periods of improvement w/each 25mg increase.I stabilized at 100mg/day. I was a calmer, more peaceful, happier individual--no longer suffering from extreme feelings of hopelessness and despair, distractedness,  having no patience, and being agitated at the simplest things. I once again felt happy to be alive, and grateful to be the person I hadn't been in a very,very long time. The neg.side effects I experienced were forgetfulness and wt. gain. Also, during the short-lived ""head ache"" period described above, I also got the ""yawns"" ~6 hrs. after taking medication. After being incr'd to 150mg/day a year and a half after starting tx (my symptoms had started to return, but anxiousness and edginess more so, than despair,etc.--caused by sudden job loss & life upheaval), the forgetfulness became so bad at this higher dose, that I was once driving on a familiar road close to home, and suddenly didn't recognize it, it scared me. My Dr. rx'd Wellbutrin XL 150mg to ""lift the fog"" I was experiencing which I took at the same time as zoloft,in the a.m.,and soon was no longer forgetful,but sharp-thinking/focused AND a decr'd appetite which resulted in the loss of gained wt.!!

Prior to that I had been having panic attacks which gradually turned into depression.  I can relate to previous comments regarding the first week or so of treatment.  I didn't sleep very much and became obsessed with getting enough sleep which, in turn, raised my anxiety level.  I felt like a caged animal and couldn't sit still.

It did help eliminate my panic attacks and seemed to get rid of most of my depression symtoms.  I was off of the drug for most of 2004, but started taking it again towards the end of the year.  It seemed to work, but not as well as before.  My mood was fairly good, but I became easily overwhelmed by my day-to-day responsibilities and would tend to isolate myself.  I had NO motivation or interest in my work and in my family activities.  Just recently (within the past month) I started taking Abilify to augment the Zoloft and have had a tremendous improvement in my mood and feel much more motivated."

The first week was rough due to the reactions my body gave. I got the whole inability to sleep, waking up sweating, slightly swollen gums, killed the sexual sideand interest side effects. Whatever you do, don't drink alcohol for the first 2 weeks while on it. While my body was getting use to the meds, I would wake up sweating more when I had a drink than not. 

I started with 25mg/day for the first week and then did 50mg/day for the next 4 weeks. Right now I'm up to 100mg/day. Yes it made me tired after taking it in the morning but I would wake up the next day refreshed. If I took it before I went to bed(50mg) I would wake up dead tired. Currently trying half pill(50mg) before bead and the other half of the pill when I wake up. 

The good effects about it I can tell it makes me feel a little bit happier and I don't feel as rushed to get in and out of the publics eye. I actually whant to get out some when I have the energy to (side effect is it kills your motivation a bit). 

I might try another later as I'm just getting the full effect so we'll see how it goes later. So far the effects are good I'll eventually bump up the doesage."

I must take zoloft in the afternoon as I would begin yawning 6 hrs. after ingestion.  I have gained about 15 lbs. which my be due to other conditions.  My Dr. said I just may have to take this for a long time, not to worry about it if it is helping me cope and live my life.  I do have insomnia and take 5 mg ambien at night. I would very much like to know if long term use of zoloft interacts at all with my metabolic syndrome.  I have just be diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  Maybe zoloft will prove to be just the boost I need to get thru what's coming down the pike."

My sister took this med a few years back and it made her feel awful, went from depressed to suicidal.  My aunt started taking it a few weeks ago (was prescribed by her reg doctor not a shrink) It made her more depressed as well and awful headaches. Doctor told her to stop taking it and she went completely insane. She would just go into these attack things and start screaming. She tried to jump out of a moving car on the way home from the hospital.  After a week and a half of insanity she is starting to come around and her psyc.  says she will be fine but the med takes a while to completely get out of your system.

I went through grieveing X2, the uexpected deaths of husband and mother within 3 days of one another.  After trying to deal with my loss for 2 years I sought counseling and also was prescribed Zoloft.  I actually found myself whistling a tune after about 3 weeks on the Zoloft.  I had felt so bad for so long I could not believe how it felt to be happy again.  I know this is not supposed to happen...but I actually lost weight on the medicine. I suppose I no longer over ate after the depression was abated.   And my libido changed, for the better.  I know the counseling helped as well.  As a nurse, I always felt a stigma about folks who needed antidepressants but now I know better from my own personal experience.  Treat your depression, life really is worth living!

Much like Paxil, the effects wear off after a few years, but, hey-- changing every few years is no big deal!  I had virtually no side effects, that I recall.  My sex drive is only so-so, but I don't think the med is the whole reason, if its part of it at all.  I think its worth a try for most people, since I've heard of it helping others I know, too.  I see other people have had side effects, but I guess everyone is different.  This medicine didn't make me ""happy"", but it didn't leave me feeling ""flat"", like serzone. (notice the ""zone"" in serzone)  Overall, not impressive.  If you're really depressed, I'd try something stronger.  I'm supposed to try abilify with my prozac soon, and from the reviews, I'm terrified to try it!! Overall, a good enough med, not fantastic. Pretty easy to tolerate, and worth a try!"

2386$Depression$1/7/2009 7:24:08 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Zoloft has been very effective for treating my depression, even compared to other SSRIs.  It took about a month to really start working once I began taking it.  The drug is a very effective libido suppressor but has not caused any other major side effects in use.  However, if you can plan ahead and skip a dose before having sex, one can overcome the libido problem without having adverse effects upon the depression.  Dose reduction and withdrawl does need to be done very slowly, over a period of several months.  When I reduced the dose too fast, I ended up with a bad depressive episode, though I knew why and was able to cope with it. Restoration to the original dose reversed the problem in a few days.  Missing more than a couple of doses in a row also caused some of the strangest dreams I've ever had.  Not bad, just really weird.  Finally, one needs to be careful taking the generic version of this drug.  The first generic version of the drug I took, which looked like the original Zoloft pill, felt like I was taking about 2/3 of my dose.  After switching to a different generic version, a larger oval shaped pill, I had no more problems.  Note that the regular Zoloft pill and both generics were labeled as 100 mg doses.

It worked pretty good but I kept raising the doses and didn't want to go too high because I knew I did not want to be dependant on this drug for a long time but it just did not take me back to feeling 100% so I was given Wellbutrin with and it made such a huge difference. I guess the two were the right mix for me and I felt pretty much back to normal and was able to get back to a normal life. I was on a good mix, and I have read where Zoloft is helping people but they still feel low, so I would suggest talking to your Dr about adding something different to whatever you are already on that is helping some, but adding something like Wellbutrin to help curb what your medication is not doing. Good Luck.

I've done pretty good on it but I think it's either time to increase the dosage or change to something different. For the most part I've done good on it, but lately it seems that I find myself getting depressed even on the medication. Another thing that I have noticed is that I've gotten more irtable lately. I've had a really bad year with 2 deaths in the family,divorce and careeer issues. This could be the cause of it. I've never had any bad side effects from it.. for the most part it works great. It helped me cope with a lot of stuff. The one thing I have noticed and not by my own discovery but that one of my mother is that I've had a lot of memry loss problems. This can also be caused because all 3 medications I'm on causes this.. I'm currently taking zoloft, xanax and ambien.

However, I was on this meidcation from may-oct 2008 and the more I took the med the worse I felt. I had panic attacks that worsened on this medication. I also had morbid or unsettling thoughts and this is not my nature.  When I started crying uncontroloably I had to be hosiptilized.  I had odd or unusualy dreams on the med (i.g. I dreamed I put salt in a washing machine).   I have been on Paxial since october 31,2008 and today is 12/22/2008.  So far I have been relieved of the panic attacks and my thoughs don't dwell on death or other things.  I also has a friend that had felt like driving over a cliff on this med.  If you have any of the unsettling thoughs please see a certified Phy. not a primary care physcian.  My PCP is great but the truth is she does not specialize in anti-depressents.  With Counseling and taking paxial and Trazidone I feel better for now.  However the debilitating effects of the Zoloft did not hit me for a few months.  God bless.  I hope Zoloft is working for you it is a wonderful drug for most people but not for me."

Zolofot has changed my life! I had been on medications given to me by my gereral practionor that made me worse ( prozac, clexea) I finally found a wonderful therapist & physiatrit who work not only with me but together to make my treatment effective. My physiatrist gave me a choice of two different meds to try I chose the zoloft. I started working within days! I still have my depressive days and moods, but they are nothing like I lived with almost my whole life. The key is finding the right medication for you!! I do dislike some of the side effects, but will take them over the depressive stat I was in. I now am able to know what it's like to be normal and enjoy things in life. I'm no longer moody, mean, rude or anxious!! Everyone has different symptoms and needs and a good doctor will be able to know what is right for you. Somtimes it take more than one drug to make it right. I also take another anti depressant at night for sleeping. With combined talk therapy and medications I have my life for the first time in almost 40 years. I'd be lost with out zoloft

My mother was diagnosed with cancer and I this triggered my doctor to prescribe the medication but I believe I have always suffered from some degree of depression and anxiety.  For the first few months it was making me quite tired but now I feel as if I have quite a bit of energy and am active for my entire day as opposed to ""taking a nap"" almost every day.  I exercise and eat right and generally keep my weight in check so I did try more natural methods before medication.  I started on 50mm was feeling better but still crying quite easily and am now taking 100mm every day and feel quite good, can handle more tasks, generally enjoy life a little more.  The side effects that I do notice are some constipation, some short term memory loss, somewhat impulsive (but maybe I needed to be a little more impulsive) and I am now beginning to notice weight gain slowly which is why I am considering weaning myself from this medication.  Someone recommended SAM-E.  Is anyone familiar with this over the counter medication?  Any other suggestions are appreciated."

2429$Depression$12/12/2008 9:14:13 PM$Reviewer: NWCT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$2$4$"W/drawal symptoms are real! How I tapered off two years ago after being on it for 10 years: I took low doses of 5-HTP during this time and was eating better. Taking the pill every other day, as is suggested, did not work. I needed to gradually shave off bits of the Zoloft each day for over two weeks (which was a comfortable rate for me.) I was taking the lower mg blue pill at the time, so it might work to start with the yellow (50mg?) shave it down to half the size then start the blue pill(25mg?). St. John's Wort was taken after I was completely off the Zoloft for a while. If I got irritable/jittery (too much seritonin?), I took L-theanine liquid drops. These can be found in natural food stores and I highly recommend seeing a naturalpath and reading books such as ""The Mood Cure"" and The Food-Mood Connection by Jack Challem. 
I have Dysthimia (mild depressive personality) and have never been hospitalized, but had I known what I know now when I was 19 and started taking them, I would have looked at diet (too much sugar!) and lack of exercise first before taking the drugs. If I had major depression, then no hesitation, I'd take them.  Anti depressants are not to be taken lightly! 
Now, after being free of the Zoloft for two years, I'm considering taking Welbutrin for a while, but this time I plan on keeping it brief and making more of an effort to eat better mood foods/exercise. I prefer to try to locate causes of depression/anxiety rather than to simply treat symptoms with pills, but maybe I need to treat the symptoms before I can start a proper routine. 
There must be a delicate balance between neurotransmitters and hormones and gut flora. There must be a subtle forces at work that have foods and exercise so greatly influence moods and energy. I want to listen to the body and mind enough to find the right balance. Medication is for now a stop-gap; a floor to stand on and not a crutch. This time I intend to be mindful and not ""pop pills!""  "

Now when I first started it I had to call in to work because my eyes dilated and it made it hard to read; I think that wore off in a few days. I think it may have been the 2nd month (could have been during the 1st) I suddenly gained 20lbs; and I worked a physical job. I do believe it was during this time the medicine started to have no effect. I stayed with it because I wanted to be better and I thought it would help. I finally gave up on it after about a year and just stopped taking it (I know, bad). I noticed after being on Zoloft that I get more angry (and easier) and can't control my emotions like I once could; I'm more emotional. Obviously everyone is different so my experience may be completely different than yours. All I know is now I wish I had never taken that medicine, I am more depressed than ever, slight paranoia has been added to the mix, I still can't control my emotions as easily and can cry or get pissed at the dumbest little things that didn't used to bother me before Zoloft. For those that it works, I am happy it do so for you. It's not easy to find something that works and works well.

I have always been depressed since my mother died of cancer when I was 11.  I was also on it to treat heavy mood swings towards anger/rage that would be over absolutely nothing.  I was on 50mg/day.  I didn't notice a huge change in my mood myself but others around me did.  My depression was slightly better but I would often still be in a less than great mood.  It helped my anger and mood swings noticably.  I would still get angry over things but I wouldn't go into a rage.  The only side effect I noticed was severe drowsiness.  I would drink anything with caffeine in it and still be yawning a lot.  When I thought I was better I had to VERY SLOWLY get off of it.  When I tried cold turkey, I felt like passing out and extreme dizziness constantly.  I should not have quit taking it.  I am currently trying Prozac to avoid the drowsiness.

Before I started Lustral(Zoloft), I still had violent outbursts related to my ADHD, but they became an awful lot more frequent. I stayed on them for two years before deciding to ween myself off them at my own accord. My OCD had greatly improved. When I was 18, I went back to the doctor due to feeling extremely depressed. He put me back on Lustral as it was one that had worked for me in the past. Within two weeks, I was manic/happy but was acting severely out of character, I did a lot of things I reget within that time. After weening myself off them, I was still getting horrific violent thoughts and extreme paranoia. I came out of remission pretty quick and ended up being prescribed Cipramil (Celexa) and it has helped to calm me down a great deal. People say I'm a joy to be with now.

The more I increased the doseage with doctor's suggestion, the more 'irritated' I felt during the day about everthing and everyone. My family really noticed a huge difference in my mood swings with this drug, and after giving this drug several months trial, I discontinued its use. The drug I now take that is effective for me in every area is Effexor. Every patient is different and also reacts differently to medications.

I also have OCD tendancies and anxiety attacks, this helps but I still have an attack once in awhile, I take Xanex for that.  I dont feel any different on or off the meds but I suppose thats a good thing.  My therapist has said I am co-dependant on my mother (who is depressed and addicted to drugs) and zoloft has really really helped with that.  I am not longer her ""btch"" and we dont fight nearly as much.  I dont feel responsible for her any longer.  Honestly if it werent for Zoloft I truly believe my husband would have left me by now and I would be living with my mother waiting on her hand a foot.  
I cant physically tell a difference with Zoloft but when I step back and look at my reactions and how I process things, I am a much happier person and I have more patience.  I am not exausting myself tring to make everyone else happy and not feeling so guilty for making me happy.  Who would have thought, ""making yourself happy"".  How can you please others when youre miserable?  YOU CANT!  I tried for 29 years.  Zoloft has given me my life back and now my relationship with everyone in my family is better.  I have found new frineds though, apparently they liked the old me, they say I have changed. "

2531$Depression$10/16/2008 7:05:51 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$This was the worst medication I was ever put on. My doctor prescribed it to me for depression, 100 mg a day. After my first dose, I had fatigue and felt completely drained of energy. I had errands to run that day, and this medication made it almost impossible because I barely had the willpower to get up. Over the next few days, the symptoms continued, and I felt like a walking corpse. I didn't get excited, angry, happy, sad...I just generally felt nothing at all and had no desire to do anything but sit at home staring at the TV like a zombie. I also had a decreased appetite and only ate because I knew I had to. To top it off, my sex drive was non-existent. I couldn't get an erection at all, not that I was in the mood to have sex anyways because I didn't feel like doing anything at all. My doctor told me that all these symptoms were normal and that they would go away the more I used it. But after day 3, I finally couldn't take it anymore and stopped using it. I felt better the way I did before I started taking it. This medication basically made me feel 10 times worse, and putting up with it any longer with the hope these side effects would go away was just not worth it for me. I guess it might help some people, but this was just simply a nightmare medication for me. I am now on 0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed, and am finally experiencing the quality of life I have been searching for.

I would have panic attacks in really crowded stores. Alot of this was caused by stress.
A friend of mine told me she was taking Zoloft and maybe I should look into it and talk to my Dr.
Its been 28 months later and I do feel better. My husband and I have both been taking it and now I'm seeing some differences. Im noticing that when I drink coffee it seems like it liquifies everything in my stomach. And sometimes thinking I have gas and will have lost control of my bowels. Frequent headaches and stomach pain if one to two doses are missed.
I also suffer from Endometriosis and am taking the depo provera shot and have been for about 3 years. Im just trying to find out if there are more people out there that are going through what I am.
Other than the health problems,(that I don't even know if they are related to Zoloft), I do not have panic attacks in Wal-Mart or Costco anymore and I can handle just about anything now to the point of crying. When I want to cry there are no tears. I'm numb."

When my husband died in a car accident during my 8th month, we increased my dosage.  My baby was, and still is, very normal (many people say she's highly intelligent).  I was very nervous about it affecting her, but now I see that the doctors were right about it being safe during pregnancy.  Whew!  

This medication has helped me for over a year and I think it saved my sanity during very difficult times.  I have recommended it to others and now my cousin even takes it and says his confidence has remarkably improved!  He has started dance classes, which is completely out of character (he's very shy).

The PROS:  greatly reduced anxiety (without the 'high' feeling that Xanax gives), lots of calmness/evenesss, and a big help with crying/sadness!  When I tried to get off of the medication, I had a hard time even getting out of bed each day, so I went back on it.  

The MAYBES:  I don't seem to notice much affect on my OCD and I still haven't lost much weight from my pregnancy.  I don't necessarily eat more or less, but I'm bigger than I used to be.  Not sure if that's the medication or not.

The CONS:  still have mildly reduced motivation, decreased sex drive, and I've become more 'dingy' and forgetful.  If you can deal with that, the benefits are great!  "

I had stopped my period and my hormones were wreaking havoc on my mind and body.

I couldn't sleep and had itch attacks in the middle of the night. I was ready to go to the Mayo clinic with all my records when one more appointment with a new allergist suggested zoloft for my itching. After 2 weeks, my overactive system calmed down, I didn't crave sweets, and began to sleep again, I actually lost 15 lbs, I began working out and had my sunny disposition back! I really hesitated using drugs, but nothing else was working, and I was spending over $500 month on creams, ointments, herbs, co-pays, lab tests, etc. which made me itch even more-I didn't want to be labeled - but it is working and I am no longer in a fog."

2697$Depression$5/12/2008 8:35:17 PM$Reviewer: $5$4$5$"I have been taking Vitamin Z for a year and a half, and it's been a real life saver.  For 10 years i tried to treat my depression in natural ways (working out, St. Johns, acupuncture, praying, being healthy, etc!), with the haze sometimes lifting for a bit but mostly not.  Zoloft finally gave me my life back and my only regret is that I hadn't taken it MUCH sooner.  The first week was rough--I was tired and dizzy, but then i got some acupucture to help me out of that fog and that got me going again.  Every day was a new adventure in not being depressed.  Wow--I sing to my dog in the morning!  Wow--I don't hate my body!  Wow--I'm not a huge, giant, pathetic loser!  

This drug doesn't work for everyone--my depression manifested as extreme sorrow, loneliness, alination and despair.  I was never manic, never angry--just woefully sad, no  matter how hard I tried to be positive, appreciate what I have, etc. etc.  

I do have delayed orgasm, but not having such huge despair in life more than offsets that.  I do not have a lowered libido.

I have gained 20 lbs. in 1 year on this drug, which is a problem.  It's not taht I was hungry all the time--just that I somehow lost my good discipline around food.  I can't totally blame the drug--I've also been a snacky piggy at work.  I blame 10 lbs. on myself and 10 lbs. on the drug.  

This drug also does not help w/ my physical pain symptoms (intense muscle pain) we believe is from the depression.  I have tried Cymbalta for that but it constipated me horribly.  So I am back to square one and am looking to try a new drug to help w/ the pain--also one that does not cause weight gain!  BTW I work out all the time and am very healthy, and I still gained weight.  Also, I didn't have any major withdrawal from Zoloft/Cymbalta--but I also flood my body w/ vitamins and antioxidants (and acupuncture, exercise and fruits and veggies), and I believe this helps ease withdrawal symptoms in general.   

Good luck finding the right drug!"

2754$Depression$3/31/2008 3:51:35 PM$Reviewer: sadie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$My husband was hanging out and talking to another woman that owned a gas station nearby.  For 2 years I have tried to cope with the reality that he was more interested in going to talk to her and would just be silent or have little conversation with me.  He drank alot and became a chain smoker the last two years.  In January this year, I confronted him again about his behavior and he left for the night.  He came back the next day talking about divorce.  I could not believe that my questions about another woman could provoke that action.  I went to my gynocologist for help and he prescribed Zoloft and advised my meeting with a counselor.  I will have to say that the combination of these two helped me keep sane mind.  I will continue taking Zoloft as long as my doctor advises and hopefully it will help my anxiety during my marital problems.  It surely did take the edge off when I could not focus or lost alot of sleep.

Then I began to notice a patten, I was turing into a stepford girl, robot like, not all the way there. I'm an artist, and this medication began to KILL my creativity. I felt tired constantly, but somehow was able to keep a false sense of energy, that ended up hurting me, rather than helping. I had a hard time keeping up with taking a pill every day, and eventually made the decision to just be depressed, then become a fake uncreative robot. "

Didn't get help with meds until late 30's. Have tried seven or eight different meds since.  All had undesirable side effects, including this sertraline (generic Zoloft) which completely vanquished my sex drive, although it kept my mood stable.  I was on Paxil for 11 years and would go back to it because the side effects weren't as severe.

Over the next two months I gained 40 pounds. While depression improved somewhat, I think it was due more to getting sleep thanks to Xanax and Ambien rather than from Zoloft. When I stopped taking it I plunged into a deeper depression than before within 48 hours and had suicidal thoughts. Took 3 months of very slow weaning to get myself off Zoloft, and 4 years to lose all the weight. I took it less than a year and my depression finally lifted due to life changes rather than this drug. Will not take again.

My doctor perscribed this for me after the birth of my third child, due to depression and suicidal thoughts.  I have always had issues with mood swings (particularly during my monthly cycle), but it worsened with the birth of my children.  This drug does not cure the problem, it assists in controlling the problem.  I still have depression on occassion, but now I can deal with it.  I know what is happening and can increase my excercie, alter my sleep pattern, or other non-medical ways of dealing with this problem.

After awhile, it stopped being quite as effective & my dosage was increased. That's when the trouble started.  I developed a tremor in my hands so bad that my finger was constantly tapping the mouse when I was using the computer.  This I could live with, but I developed the most bizarre behavior when I went to bed.  As my muscles were beginning to relax, I would have around 30 minutes of what seemed like grand mal seizures...except that I was awake and conscious.  All limbs and neck would jerk violently...and I couldn't control it.  I just learned to lay there and take it with humor...sorta like some sort of bizarre amustment park ride for 30 minutes.  Weird.  Also restless leg syndrome got extremely bad....I'd try to not move when the urge hit, and after a few seconds, my leg would jerk violently...like nerve synapses were shooting out electrical signals and my muscles HAD to respond to them.  My Dr switched me to Lexapro, and the tremor is gone as are the seizure-like jerking.  I still have restless leg syndrome, but it has greatly diminished in severity.  Lexapro seems to work as well as the Zoloft on depression symptoms, as well.

I sometimes still would experience a day or so of depression but with a dose of Xanax, it'd go away.
About three weeks ago, I felt one of those days coming on so to head it off, took a Xanax. Here I am 3 weeks later and it's still here. I called my doctor a couple of days ago and told him my symptoms had returned...with a vengeance. I could not shake this ""thing"" - I'm irritable, angry at the slightest thing, concentration is nearly zilch...the usual litany. But I also have a series of aches & pains I didn't have before and I'm literally worn out all the time. 
(I took the WebMD depression test and it labeled me as severly depressed. I reckon I didn't know there were different levels of this monster. Now I do.)
Doctor doubled my dose and said it'll take about a week for me to adjust. I'm anxious to see. 
Knowing I could feel so good for the time I did and then slipping into this fugue again is even more depressing.
I pray the increased dosage helps. I'm at my wits end. "

I have been on it for almost 2 years now, and I am feeling like my old self. I never realized how depressed I was and suffered for years until I went on Zoloft. This has been a real life saver for me and my family. I no longer fight with my husband over miniscule things, I no longer scream at my daughter, and in general, my life has totally improved. I am now in school full time and am dealing with stress easily. I started out taking 50mg and am now up to 100mg.

My sypmtoms included having trouble remembering details/thoughts, headaches, tiredness, anxiety about what people thought of me, and trouble putting myself in large group settings (I'm a very outgoing person).  I was also in a very difficult marriage and was contemplating leaving.  The first two weeks of Zoloft were awful.  I had horrible headaches, pain all over my brain.  I was tired but could not sleep.  I took the pill with milk, but I was hungry and could not eat. I also experienced increased brain activity, where it was almost as though I could feel ""energy"" in my head...hard to describe.  Additionally I remember a few nights where the sleeplessness caused me to feel suicidal, I had almost evil thoughts, ""maybe I would be better off dead"", ""why am I here""...  I took off work for these two weeks (highly recommended) and luckily I was blessed with a mentor who had been through anti-deppressants and he constantly brought me back to reality.  Once I went to my prescribed dose (50mg--I had been taking half-pills for a few days) the symptoms got much less drastic, but I still struggled with sleeping.  I found a small fountain of water next to my bed helped.  It is now a year and half later and I am doing amazing, I feel like I have my life back!  I cannot imagine going off of this medication as I am much more present in my life.  I have noticed some possible sexual side effects, as it is harder for me to experience orgasm.  I worry about pregnancy and breastfeeding and having to make those decisions, but I am very happy on Zoloft.  I will say if you are not happy or if your side effects persist, try something else!  This is such a hit/miss drug as I know those who are successful with it and some that hate it.  Also, be careful with missing doses, sometimes if it is the middle of the day, I will only take a half pill, but you will have headaches, resting helps this."

It has really calmed me down.  I no longer fight the anxiety feelings that used to keep me feeling like I was in a cage or wanting to jump off of the roof, or drive my car off of a bridge.  My only concern/big concern is that I have no desire for sexual intercourse and that have left me feeling numb.  However, I rather trade the anxiousness, racing heart, suicidal thoughts, racing mind and lack of concentratin in for some degree of normalcy that Zoloft affords me.  My husband doesn't seem to mind, or he hasn't expressed a concern.  He's 7 years my senior and in his mid 50s.  I'll continue to try and work on the lack of continuous sexal drive issue because, everyone once in a while I crave sex.  To help me out in the sexual area I've purchased an electronic friends (Super Mario) and he helps me out in that area.  In the meantime everyonce in a while I do  crave intimacy (Super Mario)isn't able to afford me.  For now, I'm ok with the sanity I've been given, and the calm state of being.  Thank God for Zoloft, and the calmness it brings me.  I'm even started back doing crossword puzzles.  Something, I haven't done for years, and I'm also doing suduko.  My what a relief - Thank you Zoloft.

I have been on so many antidepressants that I can't even remember them all.  None of them worked for me and I stopped taking any at all for several years because I felt like a zombie.  After much research and a serious bout of depression last year, I asked my Dr to prescribe Zoloft.  I started on a very small dose in April and slowly worked up to 150mg. Things that used to bother me and make my life hard, don't bother me anymore.  I have been on Zoloft for 10 months now and am also in therapy. My friends and family all can see how I have changed into a calmer person who does not ""flip out"" or sweat the small stuff anymore.  I am a happier person and able to handle so much more than I could before.  I do believe, however, that any antidepressant is a tool to enable you to be able to work on yourself and how you think and react to things by using therapy in conjunction with antidepressants.

I was on a relatively low dose, but it worked very well. The only real problem that I had with this treatment was the effect it had on my libido. I had almost no sexual desire while on this drug. While this was frustrating the improvement in my mood and motivation made it a fair trade. The other thing that I noticed (after I was off) was how much it was also moderating my good moods. I felt good, not depressed, but at the same time my normally happy/hyperactive personality was toned way down. I didn't realize how much I missed it until I came off the medication and started feeling really happy and fun again.

I've been on Zoloft for 2 months and i did notice some restless nights at first but have no trouble now. 
I am on a low dose but after a couple weeks i did notice that things were not as upsetting to me and seemed happier. 
Three weeks ago my father died suddenly and if not for the medications i was already on i think my depression would have had a devastating effect on me. 
I did notice that if i didnt take my zoloft for 3 days i had a sudden change in mood. I thought that by being more stable in my life i wouldnt need the Zoloft but i couldnt explain the sudden mood change to depressing thoughts. I immediately took the Zoloft that night and have felt ok since. 

As for the loss of sex drive, i think i have noticed a change but i have a wonderful relationship now and we still have regular sex although i do notice it is difficult for me to achieve an orgasm. 

At first i was afraid to take Zoloft from all the reviews i read but now i am grateful for it. It has definitely helped me thru a very rough time in my life.

My doses seem to be growing exponentially, and with each raise I notice some change. 

Overall, zoloft has helped me MUCH more with anxiety than depression, but it definitely helped in both areas. 

Another good thing is that zoloft doesn't completely kill my personality like welbutrin and prosac did.

3046$Depression$10/29/2007 5:32:00 PM$Reviewer: Cassidy , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I know many people have to try several different anti-depressants before one worked for them. I was lucky because Zoloft was the first medication prescribed to me after my first severe depressive episode and in less than two weeks I was thinking clearer and more rational than I ever had. Actually, I like to say I felt like the person I really am and not the person who couldn't control their negative, self deprecating thoughts. Because I have a family history of depression and chemical imbalance I've stayed on Zoloft indefinitely (10 years now). When I've tried to go off, within weeks I can feel the depressive thoughts sneaking back. One thing I would say to someone who needs an antidepressant - it does not work overnight, but takes time to build up in your body to do what it is intended to do to make you feel better.

My doctor did up my dosage from 50 mg to 100 mg a day after about 6 months to a year.  I didn't have the mood swings, my moods were more level, I didn't cry over the little things or at the drop of a hat, and I felt sooooo much better, I FELT HAPPIER.

The less I took of Paxil, I start having nightmares, night sweats and an overall feeling of ""lifelessness."" My doctor said the dropoff was too soon from one to the other. I've been going through this now for 3 weeks (with 6 more days to go) before I'm totally off Paxil. The reason for the switch is to help reduce my weight and dry mouth which Paxil causes. If I'm not feeling better when I'm totally on Zoloft, I'm switching back Paxil! I ask myself are these roller coster mood swings worth switching. I had NO problems w/Paxil."

3071$Depression$10/26/2007 1:01:53 PM$Reviewer: $4$4$5$"After reading previous reviews, I certainly can see we all have different metabolisms--thats why it's important to have a trustworthy and competent dr. overseeing ones treatment. A chemical imbalance is ultimately responsible for a lot of our symptoms. Apprehension about seeking help is our 1st hurdle. We shouldn't let a bad experience with any (1) drug or type of drug deter us from finding relief.  I myself, need to change my medication usually annually. (apparently I build up a tolerance). As I sense it happening, I freely and openly discuss with my personal physician and we either have tried a different med. or upped dosage at times. Over the last 8yrs. we have found that going back and forth between Paxil and Zoloft works best for my metabolism. Prozac and Climadyn weren't well tolerated (got worse).  
So, in conclusion, I like to say don't give up--you don't have to live life being depressed, anxious etc.. but it may take a few tries to find what chemical may be active, inactive, overactive in your system. 
KISS - KEEP IT(life) SIMPLE SWEETY!   p.s. someday our dna will enable us to quickly and absolutely know what our bodies are in need of, in excess of, etc.. until then its trial and error, and my dr. I've chosen to trust.  My own knowledge isn't always enough.  Again seek help if you are having depression, anxiety or other problems -- the answer could be 1 appt. away. "

16$Major Depressive Disorder$9/21/2017 6:17:45 PM$Reviewer: Nikita, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I began taking a low dose of sertraline in 2011 after years and years with no treatment for my depression, anxiety, PTSD and panic. I thought I'd gotten better and stopped taking it (please, never do that) and got really worse. I am back on, now taking 100mg in the morning and 100mg at night and I feel much better again, like my old self. This medication has quite possible saved my life.
34$Major Depressive Disorder$6/4/2016 5:35:48 PM$Reviewer: ZoloftFan, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"I've been taking Prozak, Sertraline or Zoloft (Sertraline is the generic for Zoloft) since the early 1990s, when I was in my 40s, and for me, it has been wonderful. I have seasonal affective disorder, but was hospitalized for major depressive disorder and total suicidality when I began taking Prozak. Until I started taking Zoloft, I had severe problems with mental energy and spent a lot of time in bed as an adult, especially during my menstrual period. Unfortunaately, Prozak gave me akathesia. My doctor then put me on Zoloft, which does not cause me akathesia. After I started taking Zoloft, my doctor added Wellbutrin to help me ""focus"" better (Wellbutrin  works on movement disorders like Parkinsons). With Zoloft (now Sertraline), I now have a wonderful sense of well being. I never get depressed and have great energy. A couple of times when I didn't get my Zoloft prescription refilled right away and went without it for several days, I could feel myself crashing and begin to feel depressed. So, now I refill my prescription right away. I'm doing so well that now I see my psychiatrist only once a year, when she gives me a prescription for three months of Sertraline, with a refill for three more months in that year. Then I visit her for my annual exam again."

I owe it to the world to come here and post a review. I want to kiss the creator of this medicine. lol! I hit rock bottom after a traumatic event. Lost my self. Hell to say the LEAST. I pleased to say I am back to work, and I love life. Thanks to the lord and this medicine. It takes three weeks to start working. Please stick out the side effects. For me the side effects were mild. Stomach ache, occasional diahreah (sorry if too much info). But I am actually happier than I was before my traumatic experience when I was normal. I have a new sense of self and empathy. Bless you all and TAKE it! This is an honest review from a truly grateful person. This combined with diet, exercise, CBT or EDMR counseling will really help. And mostly don't be too hard on yourself...be kind to you, treat yourself like the king or queen you are!! xo!

After a week of taking it, I lost my appetite and had even more trouble sleeping than Usual. after a couple weeks, I couldnâ??t sleep at all (note I was taking 300 miligrams of trazadone at night and I was not sleeping one bit for 2 days straight) and I literally could not eat, and I could barely drink. After 4-5 weeks, I was about ready to attempt suicide , so I consulted my doctor and stopped taking it all together. I would not recommend this drug to people, especially people under the age of 21. Everyone I know whoâ??s taken it has also had awful experiences with it, so itâ??s not just me.

My psychiatrist made the switch rather quickly which may have lead to the seriousness of my side effects. For the past 2 weeks I have had 2-3 nosebleeds a day. After consulting with my psychiatrist I learned it was a listed side effect. These nosebleeds arenâ??t dripping blood itâ??s gushing and they leave me fatigued and Iâ??ve had increased difficulty walking around and such due to blood loss. However the biggest issue for me has been the acne. I have never had a problem with acne before but almost immediately I began to develop painful cysts all along my jawline and cheeks and even my forehead. This is also a side effect and in talking to others I have heard this isnâ??t uncommon. I intend to switch back to lexapro because the side effects of this have been far too much.

Glad I took the leap of faith. I didn't realize just how bad off I was until recently. I have been on these for a little over a month now, and I am shocked by how great I feel.

528$Major Depressive Disorder$6/7/2018 9:36:49 PM$Reviewer: G-Name, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$4$"I took this medication at 100 mg for 2 years. It worked great in the since that I was made emotionally flat. Unlike other SSRI medications I was stable on it though. 

I went from a severe fluctuation between manic and depressive moods to being calm. Eventually I had no motivation to improve myself and was slowly wasting away. I would have been okay with every ending or just continuing as it was with no preference. 

After getting off the drug my mood cycles are now very numbed and no longer effect my daily life. While weaning off the drug I was thrown back into a manic depressive hyperactive state. I got back on it and weaned off again 6 months later with success. Ever since I have had a low libido and tend to not want to do anything social. I still have mild bipolar like symptoms but I am working on improving myself now and have seen slow improvements since I got off the medication 3 years ago. I believe one day I will be normal again if I ever was to begin with."

I've been taking Zoloft 100mg about a year now and it has help me get through my moments. But the side effect is annoying. The constant dry mouth and eyes, sometiming muscle twitch, sharp head pains periodically, the low sex drive (if you have a partner) and did I mention the dry mouth!! The diarrhea keeps the weight down with the suppress appetite lol. Overall, it's better then Prozac and Nortriptyline in my opinion and highly recommended. If you can get through the side effects, which all drug has, this will make you feel like yourself again and can withstand all the shit life throws at you. Hope this help!!

The side effects dissipated after a week.  The only thing that made me decide I really needed to look for a different drug was the fact that this made me fall asleep very early in the evening. Like 6 pm.  I have a lot of stuff to do after work and this made it nearly impossible to do anything, but work and sleep.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes open when driving at times.  That experience made it a deal breaker for me.

I am suffering major depression since my wife left be out of the blue after 10 years.  While the med does take a little edge off the depression symptoms, the side effects make the trade off not worth it.  Head pressure and fogginess is the most common for me.

But also felt the same on 50mg. I have noticed and improvement in my depression and anxiety. I just hoping with time the sleepiness goes away. Ive lost all desire to exercise or have any social interaction with people. Not that i have social anxiety, but more like i just don't care. I happy being alone and binge watching Netflix.  I so hope things change soon because i do feel an improvement in my mood and Im much more patient and dont overreact to things that i used to. I used to cry everyday, bite my fingernails and pull my hair out. I was mean and irritable all the time. That has all gone away. But have no desire to do anything anymore and staying sleepy also no sex drive at all. Id rather eat cake than have sex.

I sat in my dorm room on my bed 24/7, eating almost nothing, crying and sleeping all the time, and being terrified of everything. Walls talked to me, shadows seemed ready to attack. Every bad experience felt worse. I failed all my classes because I couldn't make myself go or understand anything I read anymore. My homework seemed to be written in another language. Even though I was a straight A student, I couldn't seem to use my brain at all. My throat burned after swallowing the pills. It was so bad that I've been too scared to try another anti depressant.

686$Major Depressive Disorder$7/24/2014 4:55:10 PM$Reviewer: Hope, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This is the first review I have ever made in my life.  When I was going to start taking this medication I did research and I read these reviews and found them helpful. I was very scared to take an anti-depressant because I was afraid of how it would make me feel and did not want to take drugs. I had this idea in my head that this medicine would make me feel groggy, not myself and weird. Well what was I thinking! I was laying around half dead, depressed, OVERWHELMING anxiety, panic attacks...so I would have been better off feeling weird, groggy!!! BUT this medicine has helped me GREATLY. GREATLY. Before I started taking this medicine I lost my job, could not function, I thought I was dying. I feel much much better. I am so glad that I was responsible enough to start taking this medication. I now have a job I love, I am back to getting dressed up, I feel pretty again. I even started wearing perfume again! I look like I had a makeover! I used to dress nice and look great until I suffered a VERY traumatic event. I suffered from on and off anxiety before but all it took was an event and I spiraled down and my world flipped. PLEASE try this. Give it AT LEAST four weeks to work. Slowly each day everything will start to feel normal again. Youll also have to put in your own work too by trying to minimize stress, allow yourself extra time in the morning to dress, eat right, sleep. This drug is really amazing. My next challenge though is whether to take this when I decide to become pregnant. Some doctors say its ok as benefits outweigh risk. But I guess I will cross that bridge when I approach it. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is something to also consider while on this medication. I am looking into that as well. Good lUCK to all of you and please try it. Take it each day at the same time and if you need to consult doctor on increasing it do it!!! I had mild diahreah and nausea at first, but it went away. Nothing that would make me want to stop taking it.

Because of this, I have been prescribed and tried different anti-depressants and mood stabilizers that were not effective and made me gain weight. Two years ago, I was rediagnosed as having depression and was told to try Zoloft. Compared to all of the other meds I've been on, this is a wonder drug! I still have some sad days, but I am able to move forward with my life and focus on the good things rather than experience countless moments where I was suicidal and thought that life was not worth living. I do experience dry mouth and need to take this on a full stomach or else I get really bad heart burn. However these side effects are worth it if I am able to function on a day to day basis.

Initially, I was taking this with Lorazapam to help with my anxiety, and it was amazing; I felt calm and capable. Two weeks later my doctor upped my dosage from 50mg to 100 mg and advised me only to take the Lorazapam as needed. For two weeks I felt like I was having a psychotic episode, while also feeling paralyzed, as if I were in a straight jacket. I told my doctor this, and he recommended to up my dosage again (150mg) and go back on the Lorazapam. I have been feeling extremely exhausted, and don't have the desire to do anything. I am currently in grad school and am worried about how this will effect my performance. Already, I feel completely behind. One benefit of this drug is that I haven't had any suicidal thoughts 
(though perhaps that's because I feel like I am in a straight jacket and incapable of doing anything?). Another benefit is that I've been able to interact normally in social situations and have finally begun to develop friendships within my program. Common side effects: I've been sweating a lot, and I haven't been eating. It's actually difficult to eat sometimes, and I have to force myself. I also haven't been sleeping that much, and only do when I take the Lorazapam. My sex drive isn't as high as it used to be, but I'm feeling as if that might be a good thing for the time being--who knows how I'll feel about that in a few months though. I'm going to continue with this treatment for now, but can't say it's been that great so far. Crossing my fingers."
