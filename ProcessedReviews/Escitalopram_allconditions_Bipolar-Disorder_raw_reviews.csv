Would experience 20 different emotions in a matter of 5min. My mind would constantly race & I always had a million things going at once. Could not sleep very well or at all & my sleep has improved.

144$Bipolar Depression$4/30/2012 7:22:35 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  (Patient) $3$2$3$I have taken Lexapro 20mg for 10 years with lots of success. A month ago the pharmacy gave me the generic. I do not feel like it works as good as Lexapro so doctor increased another 10mg, started 2 days ago. So far too early to tell. Would like to go back to Lexapro but doctor wants me to give generic some time. For the past month I have had moody swings and suicidal thoughts. Hoping things improve.

186$Bipolar Depression$10/6/2019 10:07:28 AM$Reviewer: anonymous , 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$When i first started using the medication it didn’t help anything, but after about 2 weeks, i noticed an increase in motivation and overall happiness.  i didn’t have as much trouble wanting to get out of bed in the morning, and i didn’t cry or panic daily like i had previously.  however, i still get really angry just like previously.  it didn’t help the anger associated with my bipolar.  it just helped with the sadness.  i didn’t have any side effects, which is great because most medicines i react with in some way.

My doctor has advised that I add another medication to it, as I have bipolar disorder and Lexapro can't control all of my symptoms.  This medication is not for everyone, but it has been an easy drug for me.  I can say that it has improved my life and the moods I experience while living it.

398$Bipolar Depression$5/2/2014 3:10:21 PM$Reviewer: ZeroSexDrive, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$4$"I have been on Lexapro 30mg for about 6-9 months but before that I was on Celexa for a total of 3 years. Same drug essentially. I also take 200mg of Lamictal - now THAT was the lifesaver. Before that, in the same day, I would swing between elated, uncontrollably social anxiety, extreme rage, irritability and paranoia and then finally the sobbing hopelessness, worthlessness, just kill me hoorah. We added Celexa to up my ""happiness"" because I still felt fairly depressed at times and switched to Lexapro for the same reason. Anyway, for the past 6 or so months my sex drive has been reduced to zero. I used to love sex! I love my boyfriend to death but I don't even want to have sex with him. And I barely do it myself anymore when I used to do it like 1 to 5 times a day! I have finally realized this is because of the Lexapro and I'm going to gradually stop taking it. Sex is a big part of being human and a part I really enjoy! Technically, it's our number one drive (to continue the species), biologically speaking. I am an alcoholic and started the Celexa when I was drinking. Now I've been sober a year and I'm sticking with the Lamictal but gonna give life a shot without the Lexapro and with a sex drive. It also kind of wires me right when take it, at other times I could fall asleep where I sit/stand and can definitely up my irritability, short fuse, and anxiety. Not worth it. And trust me, I don't have a mild case of Bipolar. But it's worth it to me to see what life is like sober, without all these crappy side effects. Oh, I'm also often totally indifferent to the world. I do not like that either. Good luck!"
408$Bipolar Depression$4/6/2014 10:41:21 PM$Reviewer: pantoponrose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$1$5$I began with a fantastic experience on lexapro. I was taking 80mg each day and for the first time in my life felt good, although somewhat hyperactive. I was forced to switch to something less expensive after several years of it working so well. I was put on celexa and told that the 2 were interchangeable. Celexa hasn't worked as all and i have slipped back into depression and debilitating anxiety which causes me to have constant bouts of vomiting. I tried to go back on Lexapro at 20mg and half an hour after taking the dose i became violently ill. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my stomach in painful knots, my vision was blurry and my extremities cold, i vomited for the rest of the day. This happened twice after, i tried with 10mg and then again with 5mg, each time my symptoms decreasing with the dose, but still affecting me very much. I don't understand how a drug that worked so well for me for so long could make me so sick after not taking it for a matter of only a few months. Has anyone else ever had this sort of reaction?

436$Bipolar Depression$1/10/2014 4:19:12 AM$Reviewer: Ssillyme, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I will never, ever get off this medication. After trying so many medication for my depression and none did anything for me until I was put on Lexapro. I have my life again. Yes I have weight gain and no sex drive but what is the alternative? Death? I am happy this medication is helping and I hope it never stops helping me. I do get worried that one of these days I will wake up depressed and the depression will not go away as before I took Lexapro.

About two hours after taking the medication I fell asleep, the woke up convulsing and hallucinating. In addition all of my muscles began to spasm and my jaw was locked. An hour into the episode I fell asleep purely exhausted. Waking up the next morning I continued to hallucinate for an addition five hours. I would not recommend this medication to anyone sensitive to medications. And my family and I learned that the anecdote to this medication is Benadryl, we should have been informed of this before my episode.

The only problem is that I become unable to take care of my little girl who has just turned 4 years old, 4 months ago. At one time I was sleeping on the couch and my daughter went out the back door which is enclosed and she's unable to get out into public but when I woke I was so angry that I went outside, grabbed a switch off of a tree and I ended up putting two large welts across her lower back and my Father had her taken away from me for 30days until I purgerred myself in court so I could keep her!

I can say one thing for sure and that is do not combine with Abilify.  Those two drugs do not work well together for me.  I'm just glad to have some relief for my bipolar though....

After stoping the lithium, due to it causing kidney insufficiency, I stopped everything for a few weeks.  Upon starting the lexapro again, after only one week I felt wonderful.  Optimistic, energetic, sleeping well,it is such a strange combination of good feelings for me because I've been bipolar with anxiety disorder and OCD for most of my 55 years of my life.  I pray this isn't just a coincidence, that it is a true and accurate depiction of what my life can be like now.  My two adult sons deserve a better  mother than I have been for all of their lives.  My husband deserves a sane wife and partner that he doesn't have to tiptoe around on egg shells wondering what is going to ""set me off"" the next time.  Will holidays with relatives turn into nightmares from bipolar world.  I sincerely hope and pray that the kidney disease that the lithium and hypertension caused will not change for the worse to keep me from being unable to take my lexapro.  It seems like finally, at 55 years of age I have a chance to actually be happy, and my wonderful family be able to enjoy being around. Me now, instead of waiting and wondering what I'm going to do next."

1525$Bipolar Depression$4/21/2010 8:42:22 AM$Reviewer: happynow, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Lexapro has drastically changed my everyday interactions and mood.  I used to go to a ""dark place"" very frequently during my adult life.  Whenever I was happy, I was the life of the party.  I could always be social and entertaining if alcohol was used.  Now I can have fun without it.  My days are so much more under control. My marriage was threatened because of my unpredictable behaviors.  I would be gleeful one day, and overspend, then be withdrawn and silent for the next week.  I really believe that there is a chemical reason for the behaviors that lexapro controls.  The only negative is that since I have been taking the drug, I have been drinking beer more heavily than ever--almost daily.  Once I get started I cannot stop until bedtime.  I have a bit of a sexual dysfunction as well.  Sometimes it is difficult to maintain an erection.  I'm not sure if it is from the medication or the drinking.  I wonder if the medication enhances the addictive behavior regarding the alcohol, and if so, would another SSRI possibly work as well with less side effects?  I know I should talk to my physician about this, but I am ashamed to talk about the addiction. Even so, my days are so much better, I feel contented. Little things that used to bother me, just don't now.  It's funny, but if I forget to take the lexapro, I can really feel a difference in my mood and interactions with others.  "

I have what has only recently been categorized as Bipolar Depression. I am bipolar but my main symptoms are depression. I have brief bouts of mania but overall am mostly depressed. This medicine works rather well for the depression; however, my mania/rage is not very well contained. I have made diet/behavoiral/lifestyle changes to compensate for this and my life is now pretty well balanced. It does take some time before you are adjusted and see satisfactory results(6 months-1 year). After so many years on it, I am noticing that I have gotten ""ditzy"" and forgetful, but that is still better than constant suicide attempts and crying nonstop. I was an extremely detailed and almost ocd person before and now my standards of organization and scheduling are more lax. Still, better than the alternatives..."

I no longer suffer form crippling depression or the manic mood swings that would keep me from sleeping for days on end. What used to be a slingshot rollercoaster ride of emotion has become a leisurely drive through the country. For the most part I average 8 hours of sleep a night now instead of 10-12. I can also get to sleep very easily compared to the nights of laying awake for 3-4 hours because my mind wouldn't shut off. I haven't noticed any side affects. I am an artist and haven't noted any lack of creativity or ""passion"" for my work. In fact quite the opposite. Now that I am for the most part in control of myself, I can tap into that creativity and passion whenever I want. No weight gain, lose or increase of appetite, loss of sex drive, or even any nausea. I control my emotions now, not the other way around. I have just recently moved back to the city where I went to college 10 years ago and reconnected with some old friends who noticed immediately the change in my demeanor and composure, commenting that I seemed to be much happier and in control."

I was also on Topamax with the Lexapro, and dropped a signifigant amount of weight.  I NEVER felt better--not just because of the weight loss, but EVERYTHING.  And believe me, I was under a LOT of stress-backstabbed by a friend who ended up with my husband at the time, and of course my hub and I ended up going through a divorce; death of family members; a close friend; my dog; dang-there's a country song...the Lexapro worked.  And I can especially see it now.  Presently, I am on Lamictal and Celexa. I gained all my weight back and more, am more depressed, feel like kicking the crap out of my ex and his wife. I have an appointment on Monday and am pushing to get back on Lexapro and Topamax.  I KNOW I need it for that extra push. Good luck everyone.  Certain pills don't work for everyone, but I know it did for me!"

I finally went off all of them for approx. 2 years.  About 5 months ago when I felt the anxiety/mood swings took over my life again I asked my internist for a med. that would still allow me to function.  I have found lexapro has given me what I need to focus on the jobs as well as function with my family.  I am now able to sleep thru the entire night.The only side effect is that it can be extremely difficult for me to wake in the a.m. but once up I am raring to go.

It has helped with my irritability tremendously and I haven't experienced extreme mania or depression, but my mood is down a lot more than it is 'normal'.  I stopped taking it for 10 days and I noticed the mood swings coming back.  One minute I'd be so happy and carefree and a few hours later I'd feel myself getting depressed.  The depression I feel without it is scary, but I think I need something more to take away the 'down' feeling.  Also, I lose my train of thought in mid-sentence.

The positives are a balance in mood and behavior.  The side effects are extreme somnolence, inability to achieve orgasm, low sex drive, mild confusion and forgetfulness, nausea, and indifference and lack of drive.
I stopped taking the medication for 1 month.  I experienced mild brain seizures(it feels like being startled continuously for 5-10 min). They began lessening as more time went by.  I started smelling odors that were not present, and I experienced extreme confusion and inability to focus and forgetfulness.  On top of that, my depression and inability to experience beauty and thoughts of suicide returned.  I'm going to see my doctor and go back on Lexapro or try a different medication.  I hope there is no negative long term or permanent changes that occur in my brain due to these medications.

Trust me they all stop working sooner or later for those of us who need to always be on meds.  I have been taking Lexapro for about a year now in combination with three other drugs.  I has helped me tremendously up till now by giving me energy.  Yes energy.  I take Cymbalta, Seroquel, Triliptal and Lexapro.  I did have some side affects in the beginning but went away in weeks. My shrink has upped the dose once so far.  I believe I need it changed again and checked on here to find out what size of a dose people usually take and how well it works for them.  Hmm my suggestion to anyone reading this is to make sure you go to a shrink and not just a family doctor if you suffer from anything other than just a bout of situational depression.  These drugs all work so different on each of us.  I am an ""older"" person who lives alone and gee at times I wish it did slow down my sex drive but suppose I am fortunate that I have never experienced that with this or any of the other.  It is also the most expensive of all the drugs I take but so far it has been worth it.  I had terrible withdrawl symptoms from my Paxil but I do everything under my doctors advisement.

My new Dr. Had been trying to get me to try Lexapro change is not something I like, however after not being able to handle the panic attaks and being sick and tired of them I was willing to give it a try, it has all but stopped them, I take 40 mgs everyday, and am ready to drop down to 20 mgs per day. I have still had some set backs with the Bi/polar area but being aware and and educated has had some benifits.I cannot do it all @ once but I am trying. If you suffer from panic attacks please give this a try and @ least 30 to 45 days of medication, you will be happy you did, and you wont have to suffer for as long as I let myself(seven and a half years is to long to be stupid and not take chances) Glad I did in Tn.
