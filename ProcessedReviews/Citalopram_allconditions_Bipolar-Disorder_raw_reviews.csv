This has given me enough stability that I can handle life as it comes like a normal person.  It has given me my energy and good mood back without being too ""heavy"".  I have been on 20mg for over five years and do not feel any of the side effects.  The only side effect I had in the beginning was upset stomach."

125$Bipolar Depression$5/9/2014 9:37:32 AM$Reviewer: KBars, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I took Celexa for 3 years in combination with Lamictal for Bipolar Type 2.  I felt like I was myself again, the whole time I took it.  It seemed to bring up my mood in a way that the mood stabilizer did not.  I didn't experience any negative side effects.   I am now coming off of it (reduced to 30mg for a month, 20mg, for two months, 10mg for two months, and it's been nearly 2 weeks off of it.  The withdrawal symptoms seem to be irritability, nausea, and depression...so basically back to where I was before taking it!  I highly recommend this medication.

I noticed the changes in my behavior immediately; like within the first 2 and a half weeks. I no longer cried as much. The first week, I did cry like a baby & I slept like 2Hr naps. But now, I WILL say that it makes me very tired throughout the day, even though I've had somewhat of enough sleep. I've tried energy drinks and I eat very healthy foods, but it doesn't last very long. Its weird, but

I was taking Depakote also, and that was producing the very undesirable side effect of passing out in the middle of the day at my desk at work. When taking only the Citalopram, this for over a year and a half of the last 4+ years of being on a treatment, I have no side effects at all, and no depression. This works for me, and it's ridiculously cheap at Walgreens.

I was 18 at the time and forced to take them otherwise being kicked out of the homestead. Sorry to say but the pills didn't work at all and honestly made the depression bad enough to the point of not caring if i was alive or dead. Well that additude got me put in county jail over the forth of july weekend three weeks after starting the meds. Proud to say im no longer taking them but i do have problems being steady now.

It has continued to be very effective for me, without even having to increase my dosage. Before I began taking Celexa, I'd been on several other medications for my bi-polar disorder. Other medications would stop working and my doctor would have to figure out the next one to try. I know everyone reacts to medications differently, but I'm so thankful this one has continued to work for me.

I feel there is hope and I have finally really made long term goals. My daughter has recognized the change in me and I realize that this medicine is needed to function properly. Recently have had to increase it because body got immune to same dosage in my case. But it still has that wonderful affect on me. Back to my pleasant self again.

Lately I have been suffering some of the same symptoms again even though I have not only taken the medication religiously, but also increased from 20 to 40 mg daily. I am seriously considering a new medication.

3268$Bipolar Depression$2/9/2009 3:16:32 PM$Reviewer: enelra, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $5$5$5$My husband, age 61, has been taking Celexa for 2 years.  He has grown 3 inches taller and has gained 100 lbs.  He is bipolar, and has the strength of a giant.  It is like he is on steroids, but he is happy all the time.  Celexa took him off those roller-coaster swings of high and low.  His manic-highs are now episodes of extreme physical work.  He is very methodical, no longer gets angry and throws his tools 300 feet.  And he is no longer depressed!

Honestly, I think it has no effect on me. I still have major deppression, still wanting to hurt myself, and the thoughts of suicide are still there. But I am faithful to taking it and need to address this issue with my doctor.

I would be running out of clases to vomit. I would have tremors and I would actually have more panic attacks and more anxious. I was not helped by this drug.

I tried for two weeks and had a ton of energy I could not even sleep.  Anxiety was worse and my heart felt like it was doing flips. My concentration was horrible and my hair started coming out. Just about every side effect (severe & not severe) happened to me. I will never take it again.

I thought it might of been something else but my doctor advised me to go off the celexa for a week and the headaches stopped. For some reason it worked great all up until now?

I know it has to take a lot of time to work.  I have been tired throughout the day but at night I can not sleep.  My mind is really busy being on this medication.  My doctor told me to take it in the mornings.  I may have to switch to taking it at night before bed.

3621$Bipolar Depression$2/25/2008 11:50:04 PM$Reviewer: dixievalkyrie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I am taking generic Celexa-Citalopram 20mg ix a day. It is fantastic-I used to have panic attacks, severe anxiety and mood swings, and stress-induced hair loss and vomiting. Since my dr put me on Citalopram I feel so calm and content. It makes me a bit drowsy now and then, but as an added bonus, I get to sleep really easily now! My coworkers, family and friends have definitely noticed the improvement, and life seems so much easier now. I HIGHLY reccommend this!

Without it, life was unbearable.  At a higher dose, the side effects were unbearable.  The 40mg dose each morning is just right with no noticeable side effects.
