To me, this is like a miracle drug that has given me my life back, as they say. I am amazed how effective this medication is, and I wish I had found it years ago! 
1$Condition: Depression$8/26/2015 12:09:49 AM$Reviewer: Wookers, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$1$3$I was given desipramine to try to reduce acute depression. Only after 2 weeks did I start to improve. HOWEVER, I can NOT recommend this med  -- when I tried to reduce the dosage, I experienced severe migraine headaches which totally wiped me out. When I restarted it, the headaches/flu-like symptoms disappeared. Avoid this drug unless you're prepared to feel physically ill. I switched to Prozac, which was quite good.I'm surprised these old drugs are still available.

3$Condition: Other$5/3/2013 9:39:20 PM$Reviewer: heart2survive, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$I started taking this medication when I had an appointment with a pain specialist from Stanford Hospital. I am still working my way up to 50 mg daily am at 40 right now. My main reason for taking it was to counter my numbness in feet hands and balance problems, but worse horrible back spasms. Some lasting as long as six weeks without relief. The doctor is raising the serotonin levels in hopes he can change the pain which seems to originating in my brain. Still working on the possible diagnosis of M.S., often the plaque in the brain does NOT show in MRI or scans. Other than constipation, so far so good. I am sleeping better, but it has not completely stopped the muscle spasms..however I have not  yet reached the therapeutic levels. I don't have depression as an issue, but sometimes I do feel anxious. I am so hoping this works. I fall, have no balance often neuropethy in both arms and legs. Obviously something is going wrong. I am taking this because the pain specialist feels I may benefit from it as he has used it for this purpose before. I will do an update when I have used it for a period of time.

I recently was prescribed it again.  I had tingly sensations in my finger tips and my severe constipation returned.  The constipation was so bad it woke me up at night and kept me awake.  I stopped taking it, but still take two other meds for my depression and anxiety.

Started taking after dignosed with Epstein Barr and depression. Works well. About twice a year for some reason I go through a week to ten days of mild depression, but over all it works for me. Tried the generic to save money, not as effective. Tried a newer drug some years back on new doctor's recommendation with bad experience, went back to norpramin.

9$Condition: Other$11/9/2011 10:12:34 PM$Reviewer: Azelya, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$I was put on this for headaches. It was the first pill of five that has done any good, but only at the max dosage. So far I love it, if I don't miss any dosages. :) I seem to get sunburns easily, I'm glad someone else mentioned constipation. I do seem to have that problem for sometime, it now makes sense. I've had problems sleeping as well, which is weird since I sleep like the dead. When i first started, or went on a higher dosage, I was tired practically all day for a week or two. Can't say I'm a depressed person, but my husband has mentioned that I seem happier lately. But I've also had a long break from working too. Anyways, my point, I've had several side effects, but I think it's well worth it.

26$Condition: Depression$5/18/2017 6:20:41 PM$Reviewer: Lucky Larry, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$4$I have been taking desipramine (the generic from Actavis) for depression since 2003, returning to it after trying other meds.  It is the only one that helped, although high doses caused shortness of breath, low-back pain, nightmares, stress, and anxiety.  The key has been finding the correct dose.  An important discovery was that chocolate produces a synergistic effect.  Taking it in the evening right after a large serving of dark chocolate and 10 ounces of milk allows me to keep the dose and prescription costs low.  It is not nearly as effective without chocolate during the day.  But a problem is that it is addictive.  Increasing the dose made me more depressed but going down improved my mood, so finding the optimal one has been difficult. 
27$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$2/3/2017 2:35:34 PM$Reviewer: Willis, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$3$I've been taking Desipramine for years, on and off, for Trigeminal Neuralgia.  It works very well for my pain but causes me to be severely depressed, the more I increase the dose. I was originally prescribed this as a sub for nortrityline b/c it has less side effects. However, I had no energy at all, increased appetite (namely made me crave sweets), makes me cry a lot, & and causes weight gain.  Eventually led to irritability, too.  It's negatively effecting those around me as much as it is me.  I have to find another med that helps my nerve pain as well as this does b/c the depression is just unbearable.

I was blind and couldn't speak for over 8 hours, along with other miserable side effects. It caused a seemingly permanent change in blood pressure, vision, and gave me chronic headaches (all day every day for 5 months now). I've been on this med for two months for the headaches. started with 10mg, now I am at 50mg. I've lost 6 pounds in a couple weeks since last upping the dose. I get 1-3.5 hours of sleep a night. Out of the 10 meds I've tried this is the only one that has helped my headaches. I can now stay out of bed for the most part. It took my headaches to a constant dull level, I still have severe moments of pain, they don't seem to last as long. while this med helps some, my headaches effect me enough still that I have trouble keeping up in school, I have to take 15 hours next semester to graduate with my class for my bachelors degree. I don't think it's possible with the way I feel and how tired I get. :(
30$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/3/2015 8:47:13 AM$Reviewer: temporal lobe adhd, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$"All the other ADHD meds haven't worked and neither does this one. The Integrated Visual Auditory continuous performance test rated my ADHD so severe that I tested several decimal places below the 1 percentile. And I've tried all the on and off label drugs. Amphetamine Salts works the best and that is still not worth the dry mouth unless I'm behind on sleep.

I've been on Desipramine for 5 weeks now starting at 75 and now up to 225. It gives me in order of severity: severe dry mouth (like all the others), somnolence(strong desire for sleep), sinus congestion, lowers my energy and motivation, and gave me a near death experience when I took desipramine 150, amphetamine salts IR 30 and propranolol IR 80 all at the same time without much breakfast or drink. Instead of helping get things done, it's making it even harder to get things done. All 3 use the same 2D6 enzyme and amphetamine and desipramine enhance each other which gave me several of desipramine's side effects. Caffeine works better than amphetamine for not interacting with desipramine, but still increases the dry mouth terribly. Looks like a cholinergic deficit but Galantamine didn't do anything. Pilocarpine relieves my dry mouth but doesn't solve the core attention problem."

36$Condition: Depression$9/23/2013 3:39:45 PM$Reviewer: Bobby64, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$2$5$My psychiatrist gave this to me for my depression.  I still felt lethargic and unmotivated while taking it.  Although it made me feel “non-depressed,” I didn’t feel happy, either.  I still had trouble enjoying many of my usual activities, save for in a few short bursts.  Going on too high of a dose made me feel drugged, anxious, grouchy, and... well, depressed.  Although I played around with the time of day I took the lower dose, I still felt more like a tired zombie than a happy person, even if I didn’t have any emotional breakdowns.  Also, my weight went up sixteen pounds in the three months I took it.  Plus, it seemed to mess with my ability to form new memories.  Although it helped a little, it certainly wasn’t the medicine that would save me.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

Now, almost 60 hours later, I still feel weak and anxious.  I took Desipramine many years ago for a couple of years. I take Sumatriptan for my migraines. I am hypothyroid. Other than that, I'm perfectly healthy and in good physical shape. I work and I am active in my community. I am shocked that I am so sensitive to such a small dose of Desipramine, but perhaps there's more to this than I know. This drug has not helped me at all and I cannot wait for it to leave my system completely.

I couldn't wake up completely, felt like my brain was still sleeping when I did, and I could fall asleep at the drop of a hat.  Barely functioning.  This med. saved my life and allowed me to function again.  Started with 10 mg and now take 50 mg. My biggest problem is I feel like I can't live without it and because it is so old, manufactures have stopped making it so the price continues to go up and I have no insurance.

I'm now 58 years old and take 150mg per day. Growing up I was depressed all the time and regular drugs doctors prescribed left me doped up and sluggish all the time. To be successful with this drug, you can't stop it when you start feeling better but continue the plan your doctor places you on. By the way, regular MDs did not know about this drug so it is very important to see a psychiatrist and visit him/her once a year for maintenance.

At first it seemed to help then BAM almost all the negitave side effects this med has hit me like a train wreck. So I decided to stop...with out tappering down cause I was unable to get a hold of my Dr and the side effects were making things worse for my personal life. 3 days go by I think I am fine and suddenly just feel ill as all hell and throw up. Next day (today) I woke up around noon after my gf told me she was going to work around 11:30. Got to my computer and just felt ill like if I had the flu or something but I knew it was from the Desipramine so after not being able to take it I took 50mg and with in an hour or so I am now feeling better. I am going to stay at 50mg and try to get a hold of my Dr tomorrow and see if I can taper from 50mg to nothing or if I would need to go from 50mg to 25mg to nothing over a week or so. I can honestly say I hate this med with a passion. I would rather be depressed sometimes then have painful urination/ejaculation and urine retention and constantly feeling like a zombie all day. I stopped SSRI's cause they killed my sex drive, this crap just makes it painful and not in a good way. I would HONESTLY USE THIS AS LAST RESORT. That's just my thoughts.

My body does not work well any of the meds I've been given, and despramine was no different.  I was given the drug because of pain, numbness, and discomfort to anything that moves on my left side of my boday (foot, knee, elbow, shoulder)caused by the brain operation. The drug made me very faigued, with increased confusion in thoughts, moody, and I feel as though I'm carrying around a heavy weight on my back contantsly.  This was with only 10mg which was increased to 20mg with a end goal of 50mg or fix of the problem.  Perhaps I could handle it if I wasn't still working on complex problems in software development.  But I find it difficult to do much of anything, much less something that is complex in nature.  
This post is really for people that are in similar situations as myself, and NOT for depression which is what it seems this drug was intended for. I will be talking to my Dr about Nuerotin which may be a better choice for my ailment.  So if you need help for depression, disregard my low star ratings. Those trying to alleviate neurological issues may find Desipramine helpful.  My body just did not handle it well.  "

This drug literally saved my life! Went from being a poor employee to a successful person in all aspects of my life. Couldn't concentrate on anything for more than a day or two and wondered why I didn't have the energy to get out of bed.

I've taken almost every SSRI there is (well, it seems that way) and they all have made my depression, anxiety/panic disorder, paranioa, etc, worse. My reactions ranged from hearing things, imagining strange(r) things, enragement, increased depression, increased suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, etc. My doctor, at the time, immediately said I was bi-polar because of this. Now just because SSRI's make my conditions worse, it CAN mean I have bi-polar but I never have been manic in my life. I was told I have bi-polar II. No sky-high high's but the lowest of the lows lasting from 2-6 weeks. Fast forward 2 years and now I've been on every anti-seizure med, mood stabilizer and bi-polar med from Depakote to Lithium to Abilify, Trazadone, Seroquel, etc. I finally switched doctors after years of no improvement. After a look at my file, my new Doc says he wants to try and older anti-depressant; one that works differently than the ones you see on TV these days. We started low just in case my usual reactions began. I'm now on 200mg daily and feeling great. I still feel apathetic and unmotivated to some extent but the depression is almost gone. Yes I still have my ""days"" but I'm able to go to work everyday. I think I used 400+ hours of sick time the year before last. But with a combination of this, valium and provigil, I seem to be in check. 
If you react backwards to current anti-depressants or if they worsen your conditions, give this stuff a try. It's stopped suicidal thoughts/ideations, self isolation, feelings of worthlessness, and basically the loss all pleasure in my life. Truly something to try if you're sick of going from med to med."

However, the side effects became intolerable.   My heart would race with the slightest exertion, putting a stop to swimming.  My hand were ICY cold -- which, as a nurse, my patients did not appreciate.  But what got me to quit it was that it caused vaginal bleeding -- my periods which had always been irregular started coming at shorter and shorter intervals until I was spotting all the time.   I asked the doctor if it could be due to the med, and he said no.  So, I had a biopsy of the uterine lining done -- painful and I had no insurance, so out of pocket expense.  Thankfully, it showed no malignancy.   

Taking things into my own hands, I quit taking the medication.   Within a week, the spotting stopped completely."

Does anyone else take it for this reason? Doesn't work well for me at all.I thought it might take a little while to get used to it,but it hasn't made a difference.I have also tried Ambien and it hasn't worked for me either. Maybe I just don't respond well to these drugs and will have to just get used to not sleeping!
61$Condition: Depression$6/14/2009 12:40:45 AM$Reviewer: Sojourn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$2$The dose i am currently on is 25mg a day. It helps with the depression to some degree. Goal success dose was at least 100mg a day. I very slowly - half a 25mg increased it each week until reaching 75mg a day. But it dried my mouth out so bad, it was driving me crazy. Dr. suggested Biotene gum to increase saliva - and it did, but would only last for about 20 minutes and I had to chew it constantly, so it was like adding a new expensive med to my treatment plan & don't have insurance. Of course, the dryness also created a bad taste in my mouth, so I was also concerned about bad breath. Dr. said I wasn't close to effective dose, so I backed down to 25mg and he added mood stabilizer - Lamictal, which is another story. In my case, I seem to be especially prone to side effects of many medications at very low doses, so I think that is one reason Desipramine did not work well for me. Oh, and it was very constipating and I have gallbladder disease, which also has that affect - so couldn't tolerate both together. Don't have money for gallbladder surgery, so had two reasons for really cutting down on Desipramine. Have tried everything else on market for depression over 20 years, so the fact that 25mg helps to a degree is why I haven't changed.

if anyone else is suffering from these side effects, i would talk to your pharmacist or doctor... i called my doctor and i have an appointment to see him in a week... i was told to monitor my blood pressure and pulse until then... if it worsens, then i was told to go to the ER..."
