It was very effective as a once moderate daily dose for about 3 years but I had to stop using it due to tardive dyskenesia as well as amenorrhea - I managed to get pregnant twice despite condoms and foam but didn't notice since the drug took my period away after about a year and I hadn't had a period for that time. then found out I was 3 months pregnant, and p[rescribed a therapeutic abortion. This then happened almost immediately afterwards, again... so between that and the twitches and facial spasms I stopped taking the Navane.

I was first put on Latuda but that was like being in space. Navane has helped me so very much, I would be a mess without it. I was apprehensive about taking it because it is an older drug but works like a charm! I take 10mg in the morning and 15 mg at night to calm thoughts down so I can rest

I have only had psychosis when I took myself off it.  I take it because I have tried everything else and I feel safest on this although I do not feel that good on it.

I have found it very effective with few side effects. It is far superior to many of the newer psych medications. It is an old medication but one of the best.

It's great. I had been told by someone that non-name brands didn't work, but they were wrong. (I'm on generic).

12$Condition: Other$8/17/2009 12:20:54 PM$Reviewer: Elizabeth, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$"I was MISDIAGNOSED as a schizophrenic at age 21 by Astrid Dublis.  The drug made me exhausted, caused my skin to discolor--and it never quite returned to its original color, caused severe weight gain, and persistent motor restlessness that was AGONIZING. The shrink kept making snide comments about my weight but never told me that Navane caused that.  Also, she never told me I had been diagnosed as schizophrenic but she did tell my family, without my permission, even though I was over 21 at the time. 

This drug is HELL.

Unless you are a schizophrenic who is in danger of killing someone and going to prison because of your illness, NEVER, EVER take this drug.  Also, be careful of your liver while you take it: don't drink at all and avoid acetominophen. This drug inhibits the enzyme needed to metabolize antidepressants so if you are given an antidepressant as well, have liver function tests, don't drink or take Tylenol, etc. "

He bites so hard his tongue would bleed. He checked with his doctor and pharmacist and they never heard of this. His symptoms are gradually returning but he no longer bites his tongue.  He stopped against medical advice and soon will be in crisis.
