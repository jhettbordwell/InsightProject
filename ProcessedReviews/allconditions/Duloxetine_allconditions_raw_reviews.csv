It was the first time I have been relieved of my depression for 10 years. It also managed to help with some anxiety and my migraines! It did wonders for me, but I had to come off of it due to rather being depressed, I was bipolar. So the medication wasnt fit for the job. But what it did was great!

The neuropathic pain event I had after taking the capsule was far worse than any neuropathic event that I have had. I felt like I was having a heart attack-fast heart beat, hard to breath...and my hands turned really red. Maybe an allergic reaction? 
5$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$11/19/2019 8:17:24 AM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking this medication for two months and the improvement in my mood, level of pain, sleep, etc. has been amazing. I dread coming off of it as I see that withdrawal symptoms are terrible. I couldn't get off 20 mg. of Prozac without serious symptoms. Even knowing that there will be hell to pay if I have to come off of this, I feel so much better I am taking that risk. I hope it doesn't stop working.

After 11years on paxil, and having read the possible benefit of pain reduction, I asked doctor about changing.  I stepped down from Paxil, while starting duloxetine on small dose then increasing as Paxil was phased out.  It's like night and day!  My depression is no longer controlling my life!  I don't think there is any difference in pain control, but I hate to think how bad it would be without it.  I believe my body had become immune to or adjusted to the Paxil so much that it was no longer effective. Other than some sweating at night, I have no side effects.  I am a content person now and no longer dread social situations.

13$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/15/2018 8:29:01 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$1$5$"This is honestly the worst drug anyone could ever take. I took 60mg of Duloxetine for over 5 years and had to come off it for surgery. 
I was initially prescribed it by a psychiatrist and left on it for so long because my GPs didn’t know what it was or what it did. Admittedly, it did the job and helped a lot with my depression and anxiety, but it wasn’t worth it for the withdrawal symptoms I suffered with. 
Do not take this drug long term - you will never be able to come off it. The withdrawal is absolutely horrendous. I actually thought I was having a seizure at one point. I had absolutely no choice but to come off it because it isn’t available in liquid form. If I wasn’t having surgery, I’d have taken it again in an instant to stop the awful withdrawal effects.  
I have been reading lots about this drug and feel I have to warn people. There have been many lawsuits against the manufacturer because coming off it is likened to coming off speed. The withdrawal can last years for some people. 
I can’t even describe how awful it is trying to come off this drug. I honestly thought I was going to die. I had flashes of electricity through my brain every couple of minutes that rendered me totally unable to do anything. My head was fuzzy, I had awful dreams and sweats, I had stomach upsets and just a terrible feeling of paranoia. 
I have been off it for six months now and I was lucky that the withdrawal effects stopped after around 2 months.
Please, please, please be aware before taking this drug - stopping it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life. I wish I’d known about it before I started taking it. "

I slipped and fell 9 months ago and  been dealing with a herniated disc, multiple annular tears, and a pats defect fracture everyday since. IÃ¢Â?Â?ve never been depressed in my life until about 6 months ago when I realized how long the recovery would be and how much ithe one fall turned my entire life upside down. I was crying daily (sometimes multiple times) and started havingsevere and uncontrollable anxiety everyday. I was also in chronic pain all through my spine and right side of my body. This medication Is literally saving me right now. My mood has improved and I have only had a few breakdowns (crying episodes), which have all been triggered by me seeing my now ex partner (he ended things with me a few months ago after many years). So - this medicine is great! Only side effects seem to be loss of appetite and also more prone to bruising (I have always been - but now is worse). No loss of sexual drive, no drowsiness, and no loss of focus or energy. My mind feels more clear than it has in a long time.

Works great.  Takes about 3 weeks before the benefits are fully realized but you can feel the difference within the first day.

I had serious, awful anxiety that felt completely out of my control. I did therapy for 6 months with no change before being sent to a psychiatrist. The first few days were hard as I felt irritable for seemingly no reason. About the first week in I felt like ""not myself"" although I couldn't explain past that. I just felt... weird. 2 weeks in I realized I didn't feel like myself because I wasn't anxious and my mind was finally free to think about other things. It's been a year later and my anxiety is still very low. Rarely, I have times where I feel anxious still but it's nothing like it was before: hours and hours each day thinking anxious thoughts that I couldn't stop, countless times crying over nothing, asking my family for reassurance daily, etc. No more. I feel like a completely different person now. "

She prescribed Duloxetine which I have taken for at least 8 years.  It has been the most effective medication to date. With the help of a clinical psychologist there are only 2 months per year that I consider low periods.  I will revisit my therapist before those months. I have been in and out of psychological therapy and psychiatric care for 20 years.  I would like to tell others to not give up or be satisfied with minimal quality of life. I worked with 3 other psychologists before I worked with my current one.  Only one of those psychologists was not a good match. The other two had to give up practicing for health reasons.  We moved to another city, but I am close enough to see the therapist I have worked with for about 10 years. I only see her when I need a fine tuning. I am currently looking for a new psychiatrist in the city where we live because my previous doctor retired.

A follow-up with a rheumatologist quickly resulted in a fibromyalgia diagnosis and increase to 60mg duloxetine (also meloxicam for pain, tramadol for sleep, and klonopin for anxiety). I slowly improved with physical therapy in addition to the meds. After about 5 months I had weaned off the Rx meds except for duloxetine (60mg daily) and meloxicam (as-needed). At this point I am experiencing some troublesome side effects from the duloxetine - mainly increased insomnia (lorazepam a couple times a week helps) and severe episodes of constipation. Also, changes in hair growth and difficulty w/ orgasm. I will be slowly reducing (but not stopping) my dosage to try to reduce side effects while maintaining the gains I've made. The plan is to reduce to 50mg, then 40mg and even 30mg if necessary.
BOTTOM LINE: While this is not a miracle drug for fibromyalgia, it has certainly played a part in my recovery. Benefits vs. side effects should be closely monitored by the individual (in concert with advice from their docs) to achieve an optimal balance that the individual can live with. Best wishes to all of you dealing with these difficult issues."

Previously, celexa and prozac, both of which i felt had stopped working after a while. I was given Duloxetine for Major depressive disorder/panic disorder/chronic pain. I would not recommend this drug to ANYONE suffering from depression/anxiety. I was crying over everything from commercials to someone asking me to do something for them and MORE. No reason at all and I would be sobbing hysterically. On top of that I had horribly invasive thoughts, not suicidal, but things like  ""what would happen if I were to just run the red light instead of stopping?"" I physically could not make myself smile because I felt there was no reason in the world to smile at all. Horrible drug, I begged my doctor in tears to take me off it after 6 weeks.

My dr. did not change me from cymbalta, the cvs drug store took it upon themselves without warning to change me to the duloxetine. not to mention the mental shock and increase pain, I would never want another person to be so abruptly changed from cymbalta which provide a degree of pain relief to duloxetine which is a shock when you feel so much pain and like you have been given a pill to stop depression.

I have not had any side effects except maybe a little sweating during the night, but that might be from the onset of menopause, not sure, anyway, small thing to have to deal with considering the benefits of this med.

It took me a while to find the right combination of medications that would work for me. I had gotten so racked w/pain that I could hardly get out of bed to go to the bathroom, took very hot baths in the heat of the SC summers to releive the pain in my legs, would lay with heating pads on my shoulder, back & legs (both front & back) for pain relief as well. I have always eaten a very well balanced diet w/lots of fruits & veg, fish, chicken, some pork, & very little beef, and a vit. & supplement regime since I was a very young woman. I have maintained my weight & have exercised at least 3 times weekly, (weights, stretching, swimming indoors, walking)throughout my life. To be struck by this weird disease and to look the picture of health has had me baffled. The worst now is the relentless fatigue I feel daily. I begin my day thinking I can do as much as I have always and in a very short while I am over come w/fatigue and must sit or lie down before tackeling another house hold project. I have not worked for months or driven my car (six speed standard) for fear of not being able to depress the clutch! I believe I am improving but I also have noticed that a low pressure weather system with rain will affect my pain level quite a bit. I believe the Cymbalta was the key that started me on the path to finding which medications would help me. I am loathed to think how long I must be on these medications since all are very expensive, but for the forseeable future, this looks like what my life is.

A very dangerous drug with 35+ side effects that people don't know about unless they search to find real-life experiences & studies done not only in the U.S., but other countries. This lasted 2-1/2 wks; there are reported experiences of swelling of the THROAT in which you must get medical attention immediately--I was ""lucky"" & immediately stopped using. People should always research (on sites other than the drug's site) all possible side effects & consider asking for something far less invasive. My hand literally looked like a monkey's paw & was Not Usable for weeks. I still do not see this particular reporting in the advertisement literature--just ""swelling."" That is an understatement. Be your own best advocate so you will lower the incidence of some of these frightening results. Many of the anti-depressant drugs/anxiety stay in your system even after you stop. Take time to read what other people have experienced & less on ""a few people experienced..."" in ads. I had no prior history of anything of this nature, so it can happen to anyone. There are many excellent drugs (older drugs) that work much better under supervision. Thank you."

Initially it worked, but I believe it is because I didn't have the inordinate amount of stress I currently have.  I have had anxiety attacks, horrible panic attacks and a general overall depression.  60mg per day does diddly squat.  I attempted to wean myself off, big no no.  I had suicidal thoughts, horrific dreams and wanted to punch a kitten.  So back on them I went.  My physician put me on them because they worked well for her.  I think physicians really need to tailor psychotropic meds according to the person.  Don't immediately prescribe the new and latest or what they or their family are taking.  So, now that I lost my job and have no insurance I need to wait to see a doctor to get off these horrible meds.  Did I mention the dry mouth is horrendous?  I'm sure this works for some but is not for all.

It did what it was supposed to do in controlling depression. I changed medications because I found out it wasn't working well with my body chemistry because of Genesight testing. If you have relied on cymbalta as much as I have, tapering off this medication was extremely difficult. Definitely experienced some withdraws and major headaches for about 1-2 months. I would recommend tapering down for a few months with this medication. At the end, don't just stop; but taper down to half pills, every other day for at least a few weeks.

That is until the generic brand came out and my insurance forced me to switch to it. I didnÃ¢Â?Â?t know what was wrong with me at first, I was irritable and then down right angry! After two weeks on it, I was constantly thinking of ways to kill my spouse! Then all of a sudden on day as I was semi rational I tried to figure out what changed. My spouse hadnÃ¢Â?Â?t! Then I realized it was the generic I was taking! I immediately called my doctor and told him how I was feeling and he of course said stop the generic and heÃ¢Â?Â?d prescribe the name brand Cymbalta again and write a letter to my insurance as why I needed to be on the name brand! After two weeks of taking Cymbalta again I felt like myself again! I take 60mg one time daily now. I used to be on 60mg twice a day but it destroyed my libido! So it was lowered. My Fibromyalgia makes me hurt of course but the Cymbalta helps a great deal. And although I have some down days theyÃ¢Â?Â?re more situational than chronic depression. I donÃ¢Â?Â?t ever plan on stopping Cymbalta because it has helped me so greatly! As long as itÃ¢Â?Â?s the name brand.

I started taking the medication in the morning.  I was nauseous within hours of taking the first dose. After approx. 1 week, I started experiencing a weird mental fogginess, malaise, and on/off/on sleepiness. Despite the sleepiness, I had insomnia at night, which exacerbated the sleepiness and malaise during the day. Other side effects were occasional intestinal upset and diarrhea, headaches, and dry mouth resulting in really foul bad breath that was unrelieved by tooth brushing or mouthwash. After a few weeks, I found myself not wanting to leave the house and did not have the energy or inclination to exercise, which is crucial for persons with arthritis.  After about 5 weeks, I sent an e-mail to my rheumatologist explaining that I could no longer tolerate the medication.  The dose was reduced to 30 mg every other day for 1 week, then I stopped completely.  It's been about 3 weeks since stopping and I am still experiencing mild ""withdrawal"" symptoms.  I have brief episodes that feel like my brain is being ""shocked"" - hard to describe the sensation.  The other side effects are mostly gone, including breath so rancid that my husband couldn't sit next to me.  I have noticed that my pain is slightly worse now, so the drug must have been ""somewhat effective"" in treating the pain.  The small amount of pain relief was not worth the overwhelming side effects I experienced. It has made me decide to go drug free as long as I can."

After taking for 2 plus years, there were 3 occasions where I'd forgotten to take it at my scheduled time, 6 P.M. During the early morning around 3:00 I'd wake up with severe dizziness, headache, nausea, vivid dreams and general feeling of ill health. The first time I didn't realize what was causing it until I found my forgotten pill in my container and feeling somewhat better after a couple hours of taking. The next couple times, it happened again by accident and with the same symptoms. I asked my psychiatrist and ruematologist about getting me off it. Both of them suggested I not because the depression and pain could return. I told them both how severe the withdrawal was and how rapidly it would start in. I take a daily opioid for pain and I explained the withdrawals as very similar. They told me to begin by reducing my dose by counting the little beads inside the capsule. It was then, I googled this awful medication and found the lawsuits against the company. Today, I'm still on it and can't get off and I'm very angry about it. I would swear cymbalta is a opioid and very aggressive one. I will find out

Diagnosed with Type 2 Bipolar/GAD 20 years ago more more recently, Fibromyalgia and panic disorder. Cymbalta, for me, is the type of medicine that you don't notice actually working until you have to stop taking it.  There have been a few hiccups with refills that has left me to going without for a week or two (I know you shouldn't quit cold turkey - I would try to space out what little I had left to avoid issues.) It didn't even click in my head why the muscle/joint pain returned, why I was back to crying, why I panicked every time I walked in a crowded store until I received my refill and was able to ease back on and everything was back to being at least manageable.  I totally understand that this medication doesn't work for everyone and people experience different reactions but for me, the benefits completely outweigh the temporary (but mild) side effects. I had to give this plenty of time to work but it really does make life a bit easier.

Made me nervous and anxious constantly. Coming off of it was hell on earth, but I was no longer forgetting things, snapping at people and anxious about even leaving my house. For a year this medication has ruined my life. 2 months later and I still suffer side effects due to its extremely long half life. I've been on 5 antidepressants thus far (Paroxetine, Serdep, Effexor, Wellbutrin and Trazodone) and it is eons worse than any of those combined. The two week 'wait it out, your anxiety will get better after it gets worse' period never goes away. Stay far away from this drug if you have GAD.

170$Condition: Other$11/1/2018 9:33:37 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$After years of chronic pain, headaches, fatigue, insomnia, intermittent depression and anxiety, I did my research on fibromyalgia and had a conversation with my doctor. I had read about Cymbalta and my doctor agreed to prescribe it and see if it would help my multiple issues. I felt better after the first day of 30 mg of Cymbalta. The only side effects I had were insomnia and daily headaches the first week. My side effects were tolerable, and the benefits outweighed the side effects. I stuck with it, and have now been on Cymbalta for 4 weeks. I'm so thankful for this medication and feel I have my life back! I took high dose Xanax for years, I couldn't fall asleep without it. I have been able wean off Xanax as well, something I had been unable to do before. I see my doctor again this week and can't wait to tell her how well Cymbalta helps me.

It wasnâ??t making any difference and then I experienced the formerly unknown horror of brain zaps. At times I felt like I was floating just off the mattress! Iâ??ve always been physically healthy so this was far worse and scarier than any mental â??challengeâ? I was having. Then I tried to quit. Nightmare thatâ??s a blur now of several days, little sleep, and feelings I can only describe as messed up. Thankfully, I found someoneâ??s review online that described how to ween off of it successfully. Each dose, you remove 3 more beads than previously removed from the capsule. It worked and Iâ??ll never view Rx drugs the same. Unless youâ??re facing the alternative of a life of hell without any other hope, stay away from Cymbalta, is my strong advice. If you take it, understand that it will own you and new problems you never imagined when become your norm. Can you tell I feel lucky to have found a way off? By the way, turned out I had developed Complex PTSD from my experiences and was ultimately helped only by EMDR after 7 years of seeking help from expensive psychiatrists and psychologists with no noticeable change. Highly recommend it though totally surprised it actually worked. I have a functional life now, off of Social Security Disability finally, and working full time for a year now with bonuses from my performance after being unable to hold a job for the first time in my life over 9 years.prior to now. Really want to be able to help others who are where I was.

Then I basically became narcoleptic. I would literally fall asleep in an instant, no matter what I was doing. On the phone with a client at work, or even talking with a client face to face. STANDING in front of the dryer to fold clothes, fell asleep and almost fell. I was falling asleep so much at work that I started to worry about getting fired. I went down to 20mg, still falling asleep, and at that dose, I was no longer getting any benefit from it. Pretty bummed about it. Sucks to feel so great again, and then have it taken away. I'm starting on Effexor today, but I'm so nervous with the reviews I've read.

Was very satisfied, but not wanting to take it forever even though I was much less irritable, also. Every time I've tried to reduce the dose gradually, the pain comes back in spades and I give up. I wanted to stop because of some side effects: ED, sleepiness, and weight gain (10-15 lbs.).

I thought it was a virus and waited 10 days and then went to my doctor.  I discussed with her the only change that I had was the Cymbalta.  She didn't think that it was the cause and so I remained on the drug.  2 weeks later I still had the diarrhea so I was referred to a gastroenterologist.  They did a colonoscopy and said it initially looked healthy.  A week or so later they called me and told me that I had Lymphocytic Colitis.  One of the first things she said to me was that she noticed I was on Cymbalta.  I told her say nothing more because I was already in the middle of weaning myself off because I felt like it had to be the issue.  She said yes they have found that it can cause this. So you think ok problem solved, but Lymphocytic Colitis cannot be cured.  I am now under control but only because I take Budesonide 3mg daily.  It was a miserable existence without it, and don't say why don't you try gluten free, or no dairy... I have tried it all.  My 2nd opinion Gastroenterologist said, our patients with this have also tried everything, just take the pill. Why in an otherwise healthy person, exercise regularly eat healthy would it do this... I don't know but I am obviously not the only one!

Those that I'm aware I've encountered that are attributable to this drug, order of impairment include: insomnia, excessive sweating, picking, constipation, dry mouth.  

The drug also has harsh side effects/withdrawals when increasing/decreasing dosage. For me, they lasted about 2 months and included severe exhaustion, diarrhea, significant bloating & very stinky flatulence.

In the time I've been on cymbalta for peripheral nerve pain, I have worked hard at improving my health overall (some metrics include having lost 80lbs, reduced a1c from 6.0 to 5.5), and in the interest of better overall health (especially improving my ability to sleep) I have weaned off Cymbalta. I am fortunate that with my improved overall health, and careful monitoring of my diet and exercise, my foot pain is manageable now without the drug. I am not without pain, but when considering ALL effects of the drug, I am better off, now, without it.  Happy day!!"

Slowly it became less effective. Increasing the dose made my anxiety worse. 

In between doses the withdrawal would start to begin: brain shocks, swishing head, dissociation, panic, brain crunch, confusion, muscle pain, and body buzzing. If I missed a dose, I literally would think I was in some hellish nightmare. 

I began to feel as if Cymbalta was poisoning me.

By the lucky chance (experience of a friend), I found I could switch to Celexa. In combination with fish oil, the Cymbalta withdrawal has been minor. My mood and clarity of mind have been getting better daily. My anxiety is also going down.  "

I stopped taking it all together. I still felt the effects of the drug for about a week after stopping but I'm headache free now and feel better.  I must say that it did level my mood swings I just wish there wasn't the side effects..  It didn't help with my fibromyalgia

It did help somewhat with my depression, but not as well 4 anxiety. Was also told it helps with fybromyalgia, but not much for me. Still had to b on Valium and an antihistamine for my anxiety. I began having terrible side affects of sweating uncontrollably, flashes of light and trails of lights, elevated heartbeat, turning bright red, nightmares and complete exhaustion. In bed for days at a time. I thought I was feeling well enough  to come off the medicine, with my doctor's ok,that was in April 2016. Thought i was going crazy when I started skipping days to cut back on it. Finally figured out I had to open the capsules and count the small little pellets until I was down to only about 10 pellets, then stopped completely end of May 2017. In this last month if no Cymbalta I still have the withdrawal symptoms 4-5 days a week. PLEASE be careful coming off if this medication as it causes many to have worse suicidal tendencies. Suicide has happened many times from this medication. Not all doctors know about these problems, BE CAREFUL!!!

224$Condition: Other$5/12/2017 5:03:54 AM$Reviewer: fids4ever , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$"First off I'll clarify why/what I'm perscribed this medication for, long term major depressive disorder with major anxiety disorder, social anxiety and PTSD, and for major chronic back pain due to disc degeneration and osteo arthritis in upper back with bone spurs and lower back with nerve damage.

well, I'm having mostly good things to say about this medication so far. I was weaned from venlafaxine/effexor to duloxetine/cymbalta because after taking the venlafaxine for over 10 years with no complaints except the withdraws from missing or forgetting a single dose, I developed high blood pressure. So duloxetine was the obvious choice. During the weaning process there were no issues and I sailed through it, and noticed  help with some of the back pains immediately, however as soon as I dropped taking any effexor I because forgetful and extremely sleepy on a daily basis. It has been about a month on just the duloxetine and the symptoms are getting less severe but are still an issue. 
There was one other thing I noticed since being on the duloxetine alone, I was slowly brought up to 60 mg twice daily and I have now forgotten my morning dose three times. Each time I was wildly emotional and crying intensely, the first two times I thought it might have been my issues I'm currently dealing with, however once again today I missed my dose not realizing until I take the evening dose, and I was insanely emotional and crying repeatedly today. I did some checking into this on the internet and this seems to be a somewhat common issue/reaction related to missing a single dose.  Then I noticed today as well high blood pressure can also be a side effect, so not really sure which medication I would prefer at this point. the venlafaxine never made me tired, it actually amped me just a small amount, and with all my issues you can guess motivation is a big problem for me. However, I'm getting some added pain relief from the duloxetine, but very sleepy still. guess time will tell..."

For my PTSD and depression. After a great choice made by my doctor and I based in Phoenix, AZ the Cymbalta works wonders. Cymbalta helps a lot with my symptoms of PTSD by having me be more relaxed and I'm less stressed. I'm doing quite better on Cymbalta. It puts me more in a positive mood.

This medication has rapidly stabilized my condition and greatly contributed to better mood regulation. In less than a week, Cymbalta alleviated suicidal thoughts and my level of distress in response to triggers. Intrusive memories and fearfulness have been very minimal. Daily crying episodes are significantly reduced. Additional benefits are that my psychosomatic pains and stomach problems are completely gone. Short term side effects included nausea, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. Ongoing side effects are mild dizziness, afternoon drowsiness, and less appetite. Dizziness is manageable if I drink water throughout the day. No sexual side effects experienced while on this drug.

I was also prescribed Cymbalta a decade ago during a major depressive episode requiring inpatient hospitalization. The results were remarkable. In a span of 24 hours, I had much greater mood regulation and was not ruminating on negative thoughts. Cymbalta was also helpful in developing healthy eating patterns after a period of binge eating. The appetite suppressing effect made it easier for me to modify portions and lose the weight I'd gained. I took Cymbalta for two years with minimal side effects. Tapering off the medication went well except for some nausea that eventually resided after a few days. Do not miss a dose or discontinue this medication without a tapering regimen from a doctor. Sudden discontinuation can cause anxiety, nausea, and fatigue. "

I gained a ton of weight which didn't help and that made the depression worse. I finally talked again to my doctor after I almost committed suicide. He put me on Duloxetine 30mg to start and within a week I could tell a difference. The only side effect so far is sleepiness so I take it in the late afternoon and I can finally sleep. I have been bumped up to 60mg and I feel great. I have had a bunch of people come up and comment that I seem happy and smiling.

I was forced off it in 2014 for its generic, duloxetine.  I suffered greatly as a result.  Duloxetine is not the same as Cymbalta.  I suffered severe side-effects with duloxetine I did not have with Cymbalta:  increased agitation, total sexual dysfunction, daily headaches, nightly dreams-vivid and strange, severe dry mouth.  I was given an increased dosage of duloxetine, 90mg, and this did nothing to resolve negative issues.  I also became homicidal.  I was prepared to die in a mass attack - really!  Thank God I was finally able to get my insurance company to start paying for Cymbalta again but only after writing a detailed letter outlining my experiences with Cymbalta vs duloxetine and getting my doctor to concur.  I had started buying my own Cymbalta. $7 per capsule at Walmart then $83 for a 28 day supply via a four hour drive to Mexico.  I was willing to buy my own in the end and if my insurance should ever quit paying I'll buy my own.  The pain and suffering I got from duloxetine is not worth it.  And if you're thinking, why not try other meds - I have, at least a dozen anti-depressants but Cymbalta is by far the most effective with the least side-effects."

270$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$3/24/2016 8:38:23 PM$Reviewer: Jennifer, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$4$I see so many people talking about coming off Cymbalta and the terrible side effects it has when doing so. There are so many medications that have side effects, and they differ from person to person, when coming off any medication and even just taking a medication. This best thing you can do is let your DOCTOR take you off and give them feed back as you are going through the process. I can not tell anyone to not use drugs that has been terrible for me, knowing and understanding they cause different effects in each person. Please don't scare someone from what might be exactly what could be the best option for them. Instead constructively talk about and make aware your issues and also explain the dose you are on, other medications and if you are in regular contact with the prescribing Doctor! Let's help eachother not scare or discourage.

MRI’s showed a slow increase in a herniated disc between L4/L5. As the back spasm episodes became more frequent (in bed for days unable to walk) I saw orthopedic surgeons, nuerosurgeons, sports medicine, chiropractor, accupuncture, etc. Latest MRI showed a 7ml extrusion spread both left and right. Close the to the threshold of needing a microdischectomy (Tiger Woods surgery). The constant pain led to depression and anxiety and I sought a pyschiatrist who prescribed 20mg Cymbalta. After two weeks my pain subsided and I felt better than I had after edidural steroid injections in my back. Although I still have no back strength and overstraining my back will still put me in bed, I have had a relatively pain free year. I’m sure my MRI would show a 9ml etrusion by now and I still have that option but so far the Cymbalta has been a miracle. I do think I will still have the surgery so that I wont need to take this endlessing.

Only reason I stopped taking it (about two years ago) was because of the cost but now it comes in generic. When I took it the first time I had a GREAT experience with it. Nothing works better for me than Cymbalta so when I heard it came out in generic form I was so happy and couldn't wait to get back on it. I have been dealing with depression/anxiety for years and I also suffer from migraines. Cymbalta helps with pain also. I cannot emphasize enough that what works for me or others, will work for you. The only way you'll know is if you try. Don't be scared by all the negativity you read by others. Also, when I was on Cymbalta the first time, I was never hungry and I LOST weight... others have said they gained weight which I thought was strange because even my doctor told me one of the side effects was decreased appetite. Whatever you decide to do, I wish you peace, luck and happiness.

I'm definitely happier, probably a combination of the med and being mobile again and without PAIN every single day.

Within the 1st 24 hours I had a HORRIBLE headache, my stomach hurt, and I couldn't eat. By the 3rd dose I was also having hideous night sweats and was dizzy to nearly passing out. Was so sleepy and felt so crappy each of the 3 days that I took a dose I had to stay in bed or the day. My dose was only 20mg! Tonight is day 4, but I've decided to stop. I pray I don't suffer withdrawal. 3 days shouldn't be enough to cause withdrawal on stopping, but then, 20mg shouldn't have turned my world upside down either. A year ago I went thru w/d from Pristiq when my ins wouldn't pay for my prescribed dosage. It took me almost 9 months and was the worst hell I've ever been through. I swore I'd never put myself thru that again, yet here I am desperate for a magic pill to make my life livable to the point where my last 3 days have been spent asleep and miserable from trying this drug.

I didn't realize the withdrawal would last more than 6 months and the effects were terrible. But I felt better even after I started weaning off. Unfortunately, when I completed withdrawal, I had fibromyalgia. Where i had pain only in my legs and feet prior, I have constant pain throughout my body.

This drug took 9 to 10 months to start to kick in and this was a horrible experience. I had been in various anti-depressants during my life and Prozac was by far the best drug that worked for me. I had lost my previous doctor, who just up and disappeared one day and was forced to find a new one. The new doctor, who was young, felt there were newer and better drugs than Prozac and put me on Cipralex which was okay but not as good as Prozac but was told to give it a chance, so I did. In 2008, I was diagnosed with FM and specialists felt that Cymbalta had a good track record thus far even though it was relatively new by comparison. Presently I take 60 mg even though my ideal dosage is 90 mg but two things happened... My pharmacy got confused about what dose I should be taking as the drug itself is only manufactured in certain dosages. Since there was no 90 mg capsule, I need to take one 30 mg plus one 60 mg capsules. The pharmacy couldn't get it right half the time so I just dropped it to 60 mg to make it easier for both of us. Secondly, my husband lost both jobs he was working, thus lost the insurance coverage, which was really missed because this drug is sooooooo expensive! I now have to rely upon samples my doctor can get for me otherwise we don't eat. Because the drug is new, there is no chance of there being a generic version for some time to come. I'm trying to get medical disability but that takes so long to go through the process in of itself. I'm in my early 50s and can no longer work. Maybe a higher dose would help but unless I can find a competent pharmacist or the drug company comes up with a 90 mg version, I'm screwed.

My doctor then switched me to Cymbalta with the dose going to my present 60 mg/day.  I'm better able to focus and am holding down a job again (the depression took away my ability to focus and I lost my job as a result), but I'm still not quite where I know that I can be.  I'm not suicidal, but still on edge a lot, so I will be looking to add something.  No side effects that I've noticed and Cymbalta keeps the worst of the depression under control.

I have been on this 'medicine' for a little over 10 years. My new doctor, (last one retired), decided to up the dosage when it wasn't working to 120 MG per day. I wound up in the hospital with a seizure and my body is now covered with painful blisters. I decided enough was enough and took myself off of it after the E.R. visit.
It messed up my thyroid and I have gained a tremendous amount of weight. My blood pressure went from a standard low (for me) to very high. My cholesterol is thru the roof and now, I don't leave the house. Getting off this is no picnic either. Very, very painful lesson for me. Vision, balance, co-ordination, and on and on... all messed up!
Overall, and if I had my way, this so-called 'medicine' would never have seen a pharmacy shelf. No one should have to endure what I am currently going through.
To those of you who say it has helped, be very careful if you start exhibiting any symptoms. I went all those years being the 'good patient' with any symptoms and now regretting every minute of it.

I have been on a lot of anti depression meds (prozac, effexor, and prozac), and this one worked best.  My only side effect is my blood pressure is way to low, and this only started in the last 3 months.  I have to be taken of slowly which is hard cause the withdrawal symptoms  are not fun.  I will be starting a new medication soon.
321$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$6/11/2015 12:33:54 AM$Reviewer: 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I have suffered with nerve damage from shingles for 3 years. Cymbalta (not generic)has been effective along with lyrica for controlling pain. Generic duloxetine does not work for me. I have tried and have a hard time as CVS seems to want to decide for me as they send the generic although I have requested only brand name Cymbalta.
322$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/9/2015 10:00:06 PM$Reviewer: aliveagain, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$Tried this med for bad anxiety and OCD and felt like a zombie. I tried to drive to work and almost caused an accident because I felt so out of it and had a general inability to concentrate. Like any of these drugs everyone reacts differently. Be careful. I'm on Lexapro now and it has worked wonders especially for the crippling OCD.
323$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/3/2015 9:08:12 PM$Reviewer: Sheldonoff, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I am not a doctor.  I am a sick old man. I have been taking Cymbalta 30 mg for several years as a component of my daily medication cocktail. It is virtually impossible to determine or rate the effectiveness of a drug like this when you are taking eight to ten (or more) other medications which deal with contiguous medical conditions.  The side effects of every drug cross the side effects of another drug being prescribed to a patient by a different doctor for a different medical condition.  Sounds confusing and it is.  However, with respect to Cymbalta, I will say this.  When I first began taking the drug, I noticed a definite improvement in my pertinent symptoms.  I have been taking it for several years now at a low dosage and I have continued to notice its effectiveness with no negative side effects.  In short, it has continued to work for me, and in this sense I endorse it.  However, I consider myself lucky because medications such as Cymbalta are prescribed by many doctors who are not sufficiently checking the side effects of parenthetic drugs which his or her patients take. This is particularly the case when some of those medications in a patient's chart have been prescribed by other doctors for other medical conditions.  I suspect that even routine  pharmacology  can be a very dangerous crap game when it is played by too many doctors who have forgotten some of the basic clinical skills they learned in med school.    
324$Condition: Chronic Muscle or Bone Pain$6/1/2015 8:35:30 AM$Reviewer: Abuela2340, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I took Cymbalta for fibromyalgia, arthritis and diabetic nerve pain. This medication caused severe nausea and depression. When I began this medication I was so nauseous that I could not get out of bed. The nausea did not improve as my physician suggested it would. After several days I was still unable to function, in pain and awoke with severe depression. I have a Bipolar disorder and take a low dose of Lamotrigine to stabilize my moods and this drug made it ineffective and worse. When I stopped taking the Cymbalta I experienced such severe muscular pain that even after the nausea subsided I was unable to get out of bed for two and a half weeks. This drug seems to be dangerous for people with depression and or bipolar disorder. It made me pretty upset that my physician did not take my other conditions into consideration and ignored my concerns and reaction to this drug.

My doctor told me to keep taking it.  I was addicted.  Withdrawl was horrible.  I had very disorienting brain flashes, headaches, vomiting.  Do not take this drug unless you plan on taking it for life.  It has taken me 10 months we ween myself off Cymbalta.  It is the worst drug I have ever been prescribed.

I was on the brand name drug then switched by my insurance company. does it work?...Well I feel it does some but, I cant say it works as well as others say it does. I don't have horrible side affects other than
 it does end up causing me to feel flat...as if my joy isn't that joyful. No normal sadness, no bad anger issues either but, I want to feel. So adjust the dose. Well I'm on the lowest dose you can be on. I do believe though that the brand name drugs are definitely better from all my experience I've had with medicines. I can attest to that. Also if you don't feel some things right then don't ignore your feelings. I almost did years ago when on two other meds and it almost cost me my life and my children their mom so  man up or  Woman up. Use your brain, what's left of it. If it's not working get off it. of course talk to your doctor and if he or she isn't listening them
 go see another Doctor."

Cymbalta helped with my chronic headaches and migraines for a while, but after increasing the dosage a few times, we decided it was time to try something else.
Detoxing off this medicine is CRAZY. Be sure to research this before you start taking this medicine.  Fatigue, zaps of pain in my head, naseau, dizziness. I've been tapering off for over a month now and am down only 20 of 90mgs.  This is sheer torture."

335$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/4/2015 5:58:13 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$1$4$I was prescribed Cymbalta about 2.5years due to some depression and anxiety associated with some major life changes. I started taking it and over time I became very numb to everything. Feelings, emotions, physical feelings and moods. I was not affected by anything and didn't experience happiness, sadness or any sort of emotion despite events that would occur that should cause these emotions, naturally, in any human. I decided this wasn't how I wanted to live, so I tried to come off the Cymbalta on my own. It was the worst experience I have ever had. The withdrawal symptoms are that of a street drug addict and can cause suicidal thoughts, brain zaps, body aches, sweating and severe vomiting. Finally, I was able to locate a doctor that specialized in medicine management. I had to get on Prozac to offset the severe withdrawal symptoms of the Cymbalta and had to ween off of it by reducing the mg. The damage this drug has caused to my health, my mental stability and the after effects of being off it have been life altering. I would never suggest this drug to anyone and would highly warn that should you, or someone you know, start on this medication, that you are under careful and cautious doctor care. This medication ruined my life and after being off of it for about 4 months now, I am still dealing with the consequences.

I take 120mg a day now (2 pills at night) and I can notice a tremendous difference if I miss a dose - the muscle/joint pain comes back QUICKLY and when my baby was in the hospital I forgot my meds for 3 days - not only was all the pain back and feeling much worse but the depression started to hit as well.  So far it's worked great for me - it hasn't fixed me completely but it's been a big help to get me through until I can find an internal doc to diagnose the issue here...

I am otherwise very healthy and active, but with the fibro, I could hardly move from the stiffness. Also had brain fog, lack of energy etc. They tried me on Lyrica and it didn't work on it and also made me really nauseate. I stayed on Lyrica over 6 months to give it a good try. Then switched to Cymbalta. Was on it for over a year. So it worked perfectly for the stiffness and brain fog, EXCEPT it made me inorgasmic. No amount of trying to have an orgasm works. I finally went off of it because it was wrecking my sex life with my husband. Now I am looking for a new one - I am going to try Savella next. It was just approved for fibro, and the reviews look positive. 
I had a little bit of trouble ramping down off of it - mostly it was after I was completely off - I had the brain ""zaps"" for a week. Other than that, it has been pretty easy to use, and effective for the main condition."
338$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$3/28/2015 1:47:38 PM$Reviewer: Paula, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$The first three days I experienced Vertigo, Constipation and Nausea and felt like I was in a fog all day. The 4th day, the Vertigo subsided, I was free of cramping in legs, feet and fingers.However, I continued to feel the nausea for a few hours after the 30 mg AM dose.My Blood Pressure rose to 140/69 (my normal B/P is 120/72). On 6th day, I experienced a severe cramp in my left shin/ankle and finger cramping to the same intensity as prior to taking Cymbalta. The Constipation, Clenched Jaw and overall Anxious feeling led me to request from my MD that I discontinue the medication after eight doses of 30 mg Cymbalta. She was in agreement thus I stopped taking the medication. [The reason for prescribing was to lessen my fatigue and neuropathy.]

However, the withdrawal side effects are horrendous!  Patient should be warned in advance of beginning treatment and allowed to weigh their options.  I weaned off over the period of one year.  After one week off the medication, I am still very sick physically.  Headache, nausea, dizziness and confusion.  I would not recommend starting this drug unless you have no other options.

Caused permanent brain damage and I now have to take medication to treat the Night Terrors it gave me. Was completely in a state of hallucinations, paranoia, and terror during my treatment with this medication. No family history of bipolar disorder but personal history of severe PMDD (like PMS but much worse).  This medication has ruined my life - please take it with caution.

I have currently been weaning myself off of it for over a month and have been completely off of it for 4 days. The debilitating headache I suffer from each day is joined by constant nausea, terrible sleep,agitation, inability to focus,inability to stand still for even short periods of time, and today I went to the doctor and discover that my blood pressure is almost 30 points higher than 6 weeks ago. I am now on a beta blocker in hopes to return it to normal. Do your research before taking this drug, it has something called Cymbalta withdrawal disorder linked to it. Too bad I didn't know this before I started taking it.

The pain was bearable with this medication. Unfortunately, even though the literature says weight loss is a side effect, I gained 40 pounds the first year despite being much more active and my diet was the same. I tried quitting cold turkey and that was a nightmare so I went back on it. I am now fed up with the extra 50 pounds...weaning off over a period of two months. I now have kidney, liver, adrenal problems that were not evident before taking the drug. I chose this drug much too quickly, trusting the literature, and now I wish I'd never tried it. If you don't mind the weight change, it could be amazing for fibromyalgia sufferers....just never go off cold turkey!

My fibro seemed better but the second week I started hurting again so my doctor increased my dosage to 60 mg. It has been a life saver for me. Last month I had to purchase the generic version because my money was low, needless to say I will never go back to the generic cymbalta. It Did Not Work for me at all..... It gave me headaches everyday, and not normal headaches, I had what felt like pressure in my head. Like I had a rubber band wrapped around my head. I know that Cymbalta is expensive but it is honestly worth it. I am a completely different person when I take it. I can actually move and get out and do things. I'm 42 years old and Fibro had me down before, but not now. The only downside to Cymbalta is the price but I will do without something else every month so that I can get this medicine. I wish that they would lower the price of it because it's hard to pay for it every month when you don't have insurance.

If you are taking this for anything other than overall pain, you will be disappointed. I highly recommend using Cymbalta with an SSRI. Zoloft with Cymbalta has been most effective for me.

The biggest side effect is trying to come off of it. It doesn't work so much for easing psychological pain as it does for easing physical pain, which is counterintuitive to its mandate. I highly suggest using a SSRI in conjunction with Cymbalta as it only works fairly well for depression and anxiety.

I had a closed head injury and several medicines to wake me up and sleep and function for years I was a guinea pig and almost gave up from the pain of it all. When my doctor prescribed cymbalta a high dose I cried and cried finally I am on 60 mg per day and I am functioning and have a boyfriend and want to enjoy the time I have with my mom who is 83 years old, I have missed out on so much family time because of depression and trying to climb out of a black hole is hard, because I was alone and had no barometer to tell me if crying 24 hours a day or the opposite of pure rage was healthy or not, I couldn't figure it out myself until I went back to doctor and he would tell me this is not healthy so lets try something else. I have been on 60 mg for over 3 years now and I think more positive and hope anyone who is in a state of depression to keep trying to find the right combination to help you get out of the black hole. The sun is beautiful and I can finally see it, I now have no curtains on my windows and love it.

Most alarmingly it became increasingly difficult for me (a male) to achieve orgasm, something I'd never experienced. Often I would simply give up. Within a week of discontinuing the drug I found that that problem has disappeared. This is evidently rare, at least according to the listed side effects, but I can't express how frustrating and bizarre this was. I'm certainly done with Cymbalta!

Dr. ruled out arthritis, and thought perhaps my meds were 'suddenly' causing the pain.  Switched me over to Cymbalta.  After about 6 weeks into the lowest dose in my system, I developed chronic diahrea.  Even drinking water would send me running to the bathroom.  Ended up in the ER for IV fluids twice, stool cultures, colonoscopy -- no one could find a reason for the valve not shutting off --- this went on for 5 weeks.  Finally I stopped the Cymbalta and within 2 - 3 days, I could eat again without a trip to the bathroom.  AMEN!

But cymbalta turned my life around and I am doing wonderful now. It started working after the first day I took it.

Physical impact included high blood pressure, heavy weight gain leading to high cholesterol, and the inability to empty my bladder leading to chronic UIT's. I did a gradual taper under my psychiatrist's guidance and went through a devastating withdrawal from which i still have not recovered over 5 months later. developed serious symptoms I never had previous to taking cymbalta including disabling anxiety.   do not let anyone tell you it is the depression coming back. this happens to people who took it for pain and had no history of depression. the black box warning mentions risk of suicidal thoughts. it happens when increasing and decreasing your dose. do not let a doctor tell you that you need anti-depressants for life. get good cognitive behavioral therapy. research shows it works better than drugs and i am living proof. now that i quit, i am active, lost weight, now my bmi is 20. no more High BP and cholesterol is 95.

I was treated with IV steroids for a scary episode where I was partially blind in one eye. The steroids worked wonders on my pain and fortunately, there was nothing wrong with my eyesight. However, the drug lowered my immunity. I caught the flu & developed bronchitis and it took 6 weeks to get better. While I was recovering I lost my job. All of this together quickly spiraled me into a deep, painful, depression. I found myself weeping for no reason at all and sleeping as often as I could. My digestive system was a mess. I couldn't eat normally. I felt helpless, I felt out of control. I hurt everywhere.

CYMBALTA saved my life. It removed the overall pain and greatly improved my mood and energy. If you use this, remember to take the drug at the same time daily. Missing a dose or being casual with your dosage is bad. You might experience insomnia for the first month as your brain gets used to the new levels of chemical interactions. This is normal. Inability to climax while sexually stimulated is also normal. Eventually (3 months for me) it all normalized. The relief from constant pain and sadness is worth the initial side effects and need to take the drug consistently for me. Don't give up quickly and whatever you do, don't wean yourself off without help. (I tried Effexor years ago and the half-life is shorter than Cymbalta which made dosage timing even more critical. These are powerful drugs which work wonders if you use them correctly.)"

Do not take this medication no matter what any doc says.  I am 45 years old and have never felt WORSE in my whole life. ...

At first the generic seemed to work.  We had to raise the dosage gradually from 30mg to 90 mg. to cover the nerve pain.  I started having stomach pains and diarreha off and on, but never thought about it being related to the duloxetine.  Then the stomach pains became more consistent and the diarreha never stopped for 5 weeks a few months ago.  I went through a CT scan, a EGD, blood tests, urine tests, to a gastroenterologist, and then to a rheumologist.  They couldn't find anything wrong with me.  Then told me to go off the Cymbalta generic.  I'm trying to go off right now; it's very, very hard.  Lots of withdrawal pains.  Stomach pains and diarreha have stopped.  Don't go on this medicine.

I had never experienced dry mouth before and thought it was a ridiculous side effect, but it's hampered my comfort and speech. Also, I experienced a significant decrease in sexual drive. However, it very effectively treated my depression and I'd recommend it in certain situations.

My only concern at this time is the overwhelming dizziness and sleepiness the next morning. I do realize that it takes weeks before a psychotropic med settles in but would love someone else's experience with this drug. I am pretty much on my own with this  because I go to a County Mental Health Facility meaning any follow up is not on the menu....I have been on so many different meds. Over the years including ECT.  God help me, I pray this one will be effective in a good way... I know you have to commit to it and allow a few weeks before throwing in the the towel. I hate that, but what can you do?

My brain was in such a fog, I didn't have the sense to relate the symptoms with the medication. For 3 hours after I woke up this would be so bad, I couldn't brush my teeth or do anything with my hands/arms but it was the feeling that was the worst. It got so bad, I knew 1 of three things would happen: 1. I would die from this 2.I would be committed to a mental facility or 3. I would figure out what was wrong and get better. My doctor was no help. It was all on me. I finally realized what caused it and stopped taking the med cold turkey. The arm/hand improved by the next day. The side effects of stopping are very bad but not as bad as what I dealt with while taking the med.

I, too, experience the profuse sweating as others, particularly of my head.  Whereas Cymbalta initially helped my depression, it appears to be slowly lessening in effectiveness.  I know better than to quit cold turkey, so I cut back to 60 mg. a week ago; I cannot tell any difference.  I'll keep it up for a couple of weeks and then cut to 30 mg. to see what happens.  It's the steady weight gain, constant exhaustion, and lack of emotional highs and lows that are doing me in -- not ever joyful and not ever deeply moved, which is all part of the human condition.

The first couple weeks was horrible for me. Nausea, dizzy spells, heart palpitations,etc. All gradually began to get better and my doctor upped my dose to 60mg. Side effects not so bad now AND I'm beginning to feel better which is encouraging. Right now I am taking 30mg twice a day - 2pm and 8pm. It has been a challenge to remember to take the medicine at those strange times. When I took my dosage at 8am, by 2pm I was in a 'fog' and had a terrible time focusing on anything (which was probably more from my condition than form the medication). We moved the dose to later in the day and I have found the 'foggy' episodes are less severe. This is tramendous for me and my work schedule. I have to admit I fought taking this medicine hard. After my first month I had a list of reasons why I felt the medicine was making me sick. My doctor gently explained away all my worries and showed me it was my disease making me sick. That was a blow because so bad I wanted it to be the medicine making me sick and not my diease. That way, in my mind I could stop taking the medicine and I would feel better. He backed up his explanation with an offer to wean me off the medicine and see how I felt for a couple of weeks. He was right! As bad as I thought the medicine was making me feel, I felt 10 times worse without it. I don't know why it is so hard to remember that.

I went off after a few days, but my pain returned so I went back on for about a week.  My pain again disappeared.  But I can not sleep my life away and went off again.  I will deal with my pain in exercise, better diet, etc.  My pain med will be Tylenol at night.  Now I feel sick and I am sure it is some kind of withdrawal.  It is a holiday weekend, but after I am going back on celexa 10mg. which has worked for me for years, but doesn't help my pain which is why I asked for duoloxetine.  Can't afford brand name.  This fall I will have a light box, which I should have tried years ago.

Duloxetene HCL has been excellent at relieving pain in my neck and joints. Duloxetene HCL does not work like a narcotic or OTC analgesic, I think it scrambles pain messages so the pain isn't so intense.

I take 60 mg daily, in the morning, and have no negative adverse events that get in the way of living my life to the fullest. The only side effects I've experienced are mild: dry eyes in the evening, so I take out my contacts and wear glasses which fixes the problem; when I feel the urge to pee, I pretty much have to stop what I'm doing and go then; some very mild sweating, just a tiny mist on my forehead) but not on a daily basis or in a predictable manner (the sweating is noticeable only because I rarely sweat).

I can live with these mild side effects. I have none of the effects others speak of. I have to admit I was scared to take this medication when my doctor ordered it, because the reviews are mostly negative about Cymbalta. I'm glad I tried the med, however, because it's worked like a charm for me."

Taking this (30mg first week now 60mg) along side Gabapentin 300mg 2x3/day. It's helped my daily pain slightly(was 5-6, now 3-4)but I still have bad days when I'm very active (7-8).

Side effects I've experienced is an almost complete loss in sex drive and ability, dry mouth, and I'm sleeping less. No mood swings or depression, though I've always been a very controlled person.

Reading some of the other comments though, makes me scared to stop taking it, should my doctor or I decide to try something else for my pain. I say if you take this and start experiencing the mood swings, rage, or depression, CALL YOUR DOCTOR so you can get off it right away."

I am 51 and had pain in my wrist; upper and lower back; shoulder;knees.  So my rheumatologist put me on 30mg Cymbalta and told me to give it a few weeks to work. It was a very bad experience for me (I had taken other antidepressants in the past and never had a problem with any of them.)  I hadn't been on one for about a year and was doing fine until all the aches and pains brought me down. (I am tall and thin and before back surgery was very active.)  The Cymbalta worked for the back pain, but when I first started taking it I couldn't sleep at all the first week, then the 2nd week I slept 24 hours straight one day and got very depressed crying and listless and lost the will to live.  I quit taking it and immediately started feeling better. Since I was on a very low dose of Cymbalta and have taken Lexipro and Prozac successfully in the past, I think Cymbalta is a much heavier drug than I am willing to take.  It is an SNRI as opposed to an SSRI and I've come to the conclusion that my norepinephrine level should not be messed with. I know some people might think ""she should have given it more than 2 1/2 weeks to work.""  To those people I say- any drug that can change your brain that much in such a short period of time is way more powerful and scary than anything I've ever been on.  My nephew had the same experience on it.  I'm glad I am off of it and would much rather have the pain than be a zombie."

491$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$4/27/2014 1:04:21 AM$Reviewer: lassale, 55-64 Male  (Patient) $5$5$5$60 year old male. Since childhood have always had anxiety problems. Because of this, I have felt chest pressure most days of my life which is very annoying. Although my life is truly blessed and wonderful the anxiety has steadily gotten worse and depression has joined it. Have tried just about every antidepressant and anxiety med. Cymbalta at 90 mg (even the generic) works very well for me. It does have in my case strong sexual side effects including lack of interest and performance, but other than that, I think it is a wonderful drug. I tried going off Cymbalta twice. I could not succeed. So my feeling is I will probably be on it forever unless something better comes along. It fully eliminates the anxiety and reverses the depression. The chest pressure goes away after about 2 weeks on Cymbalta but it does take a good 8 weeks to experience its full effect. I feel the generic is a bit weaker than brand, but at the 90 mg, it is fine. Good luck!

My pain was gone and I felt amazing. Never felt like a human before. Being free of pain naturally made me happy and my mood improved greatly. Within 4 months however, my pain started creeping back. I began having migraines which i never had before. I began to experience vertigo several times a week that was so bad I had to curl into a ball and squeeze my eyes shut to try to stop the spinning sensation. I became hyper sensitive to smells and developed allergy sensitivities to the smallest things, often with hives. I gained weight. Constant dry mouth and stomach pain. My insurance kept fighting my doctor refusing to pay for it each month so I'd go through terrible withdrawal while they sorted it out for days between refills. I eventually weaned myself off of it over the course of 3 weeks. Experienced horrible mood swings, crying bursts, intense rage, anxiety attacks, and more migraines. This was the first time I had ever taken a prescription drug for anything and now I'm terrified to even try anything else. One vertigo episode hit me when I was driving to work down the highway and I barely made it to the shoulder of the road. That's when I stopped taking it.

I was taking it for fibromyalgia and noticed my hair was thinning.  I suspected cymbalta.  I went off of it after weaning for three months and I have been off of it about three months.  Patches of hair were stick straight up in my part.  Went to the hairdresser for a cut and asked why my hair, which is quite long, had short patches sticking straight up.  She examined my hair throughout and I had a lot of new hair all over my head all around the same length.  I asked her how long time wise the growth was and it was 6 months growth.  After trying to figure it out, it was about six months I have been off of cymbalta.  I suspected it was cymbalta.  This was absolute proof.  Hairdresser said to keep doing what I was doing, it was going off cymbalta.  Btw most horrible experience I ever went thru in my life was going off cymbalta.  Stroke like symptoms.  Had to have a brain MRI,etc.  cymbalta makes your hair fall out.  I don't know if I will ever get my full head of hair back.  We'll see.

It was prescribed by a neurologist for pain in my shoulder, arm, wrist and hand, and although I took it for only three days, it caused very serious side effects. I was nauseated, slept 18 hours a day, was disoriented, dizzy, and became anxious and depressed...and I was 68 at the time, not ""under 25."" After an evening when my husband (who was fortunately watching over me) heard me ask him from the couch ""Am I at home?"" he told me ""You need to get off that stuff. Now."" I did, but it took days for the drug to completely exit my system. The drug had had no effect on my pain. When I was lucid again, I filed a written compliant with the FDA. To repeat my bottom line: my experience is that this is an extremely dangerous drug. I suppose I should have been more wary of having a drug that had failed as an anti-depressant prescribed to me for another use. Next time any physician wants me to ""try"" a drug, I'll be likely to take Nancy Reagan's advice and ""Just say no.''"

Bupropion added & felt great for probably 6 months then slowly started having symptoms.  Brain fog, inability to to think & concentrate at work.  As hard as I tried I could not.  It was so bad it completely zapped my energy & I was so fatigued. I went to doctors trying to figure out what was wrong with me & nobody could find anything.  It was to the point of being really scary.  Sometimes I wondered if I should even be driving.  I'd have to ask people at work how to do simple things that I had been doing for 20 years, I couldn't remember their names.  Scary, I would think about killing myself even though I didn't want to die.  God answered my prayers & got me with a psychiatrist who changed me over to generic Effexor XR over a week period (no withdrawal symptoms).  I think Cymbalta should be taken OFF the market, horrible medication!!!  I will give it a 0 rating.  When I contacted the company about the extremely expensive copay earlier on when I took it they told me it was fair.  $300.00 copay?  Fair to who?  Not the consumer that is for sure.  Nonprofit group Public Citizen has been urging the FDA to pull Cymbalta from the market stating the risks out weigh the benefits.  They should pull it!!"

I started it because of anxiety I was feeling due to a number of life changes happening all at once. The only long term side effects I experienced after my body became used to it were increased sweating and feeling hot. If I missed a dose, I would feel ""electric zaps"" in my arms and hands that would subside when I took the next dose. However, after 5 years I started gradually tapering my dose because I wanted to be off of it and had HORRIBLE withdrawal effects with each small decrease - dizziness, nausea, shakiness, restless legs, pounding headache upon standing, depression, crying spells, irritablilty and agitation, and panic attacks. It has taken me over a year and I am still not completely off. When I originally tried to stop taking it after I stabalized on 20 mg, which is the smallest dose available, the effects were so bad after 48 hours that I could not even stand up and walk, let alone drive my car to work. I have had to resort to opening the 20 mg capsules (with my doctor's approval) and removing more and more beads inside. Looking back, I would have rather suffered through the anxiety I was feeling 5 years ago than started this drug. It would have been worth it to me only if I wanted to be on it forever. "

It was a very fast remedy for me.  I soon stopped worrying about what the guy at the grocery store thought or whether news stories on the radio were about me.  Cymbalta interuppted my sleep horribly for about two weeks, then everything improved. I was both more energetic and more sluggish at the same time, mental energy was up, physical energy down, my weight went up. Cymbala also cured my chronic pain from lower back injury as a side effect!
I think it lowers my sex drive a bit. I went off cymbalta because I felt so good and MAN was that a mistake. I was worse than ever before off it, paranoid beyond anxiety and depressed to the point I couldnt function. I went back on and it was horrible for almost a month, no sleep, but it was slowly getting better in 3rd and 4th week and bang, I was back to normal, or at least how I used to be.  I have now been on for 7 years total and would like to figure how to get off someday.  But I dont want that horrible depression back.  I sleep deeply and for 8 hours now. "

Withdrawal from cymbalta is compared to heroin....I was told the only thing I could was to start taking it again....never will I take this drug again.  Worse is I saw 3 different docs ....No one ever suggested my symptoms were a Side effect of cymbalta...just more pills to try to deal with all of them...but when I stopped the benzos I truly thought I was going to die...panic attacks really really bad....I had no clue they were controlling most all of these side effects....I would have thought the doc would have known but just kept giving me cymbalta which I kept taking..SCARY good luck if this is the road you take...after 9 months of NO meditation I continue to have severe ""brain zaps"" and the ringing buzzing & pounding in my ears is non stop...I continue to hope this too will pass."

It has worked extremely for me, though it is one of other psychiatric drugs I take. Unless you get intolerable side effects, this drug requires adjustment time, like most psych drugs. You might not not if any changes, but the classic way to see if the drug helps you is: Instead of a friend coming up to you asking, ""How are you?"" in a quasi-I'm trying to sound happy but your look is scaring me voice, that same person says to you, ""You're looking fabulous!"", and you can see they mean it. Though that doesn't always happen, you'd be surprised on how often it does. Another way is think about your day. Did you feel better after, or even during, a bad situation? Or even the fact you COULD deal with issue in total? Those are two times that I finally noticing I'm better, because I live with myself and can't see any changes. I have to have someone else point it out to me."

I finally realized that over the past year my depression and anxiety have gotten worse. I just kind of go through life in a haze, with some good days but mostly bad days. I've been on Cymbalta for so long that I can't really pinpoint any symptoms specifically from the medicine. I have significantly gained weight and been VERY tired over the past couple of years--then again, I have been in college/grad school for the past couple of years as well. I just recently met with my doctor to see if I could change my prescription. She told me that Cymbalta over time can cause liver damage (just what a 21+ year old wants to hear!), and that over 60 mg, the effects aren't very significant on depression/anxiety, but the symptoms of course increase. So we have decided to slowly wean me off of Cymbalta and hopefully onto a more effective medicine. Today is my first day reducing my dosage to 90 mg. I am very nervous about potential side effects (especially with finals in 6 weeks). But I hope someday I can feel just a tad bit more ""normal,"" or less tired, sad, and anxious. "

I was on it for severe constant pain, but it not only didn't work for it, but caused severe rage, depression and mood swings.  It took me 2 months of tapering down to get off.  I lost my job, drove away loved ones and became severely suicidal.  There is no safe, effective way to taper off.  It is a painful, long process that makes you wish you were dead.  I regret ever having tried this pill.  It's been 2 months and I fear I will be psychologically damaged forever.  The vertigo and nausea caused by withdrawal is horrific.  Brain zaps, vomiting, uncontrollable crying... This medication should be taken off the market.  It's poison, pure and simple.  Shame on the maker Eli Lily.

A way to handle the cost is to utilize the Cymblata web site for % off. Also I had taken the 60MG and that was way to much and noticed a big difference in the way I felt.

It was a switch from Lexapro. I take 60 mg on alternate days (every 2 days) and sometimes once daily. In terms of side effects, the dry mouth and constipation affected me the most. There was also suicidal thoughts and increased anxiety when I was on Cymbalta. I would say it had a better effect on me compared to Lexapro which didn't work at all.  However, Cymbalta also made me feel apathetic sometimes.  Overall, it did help reduce depression but the feelings were replaced by apathy.

687$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$9/6/2013 10:43:02 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been on Cymbalta at 60mg for 3 months and so far I think it's wonderful. Before this I was on Pristique and I would have episodes of uncontrollable crying and anxiety. I weaned off it for about 3 weeks before getting on Cymbalta and that was an awful thing to go through. Cymbalta helped me right away. Cymbalta has helped me feel more like myself and I can go on with my normal daily activities. Pristique and other anti-depressants have made me feel foggy. Cymbalta does not do this to me. I've had trouble sleeping with other medicines and with cymbalata I occasionally wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom but then fall right back asleep. I'm not so sure if that is a direct relation to the medication or not. I also have bad gas occasionally (not uncontrollable, just stinky) but i'm not sure if it is a side affect and if it is it is very minor compared to the benefits. I haven't experienced any weight gain/loss and I follow a healthy diet. Cymbalta is working for me but won't work for everyone. Pristique was horrible for me but is great for others. Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain (in most cases) and everyone is different. So I encourage you to try it and keep trying until you find the right one.
688$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$9/6/2013 8:14:35 AM$Reviewer: MED CHOICE , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$1$5$Cymbalta is excellent medication the choice is yours. The good: Cymbalta is extremely excellent medication for Sevier pain condition with no other medications camper 10/10. Best medication for anxiety,panic attacks and depression with no other medications camper 9/10. The Cymbalta side effects are last for 30 days from start to withdraw same side effects when start cymbalta to does change up or down to withdraw cymbalta you going to experience same side effects when you started on day one. The bad: Cymbalta minor side effects going away once you get used to it and the other harsh side effects will start as long as you on cymbalta and last 3 months after first day withdrew cymbalta. Cymbalta make you become suicidal if you have a lots of friends you going lose most of them if you are married your marriage will fall apart if you are a professional you going to loss your profession if you're family lover you going lose it,basically you lose one by one as you go on with cymbalta. When you read all the reviews people say good things and bad things about cymbalta but you experience all of it slowly one by one. Cymbalta does effects the liver the most if you're alcohol drinker stop you going lose your liver,don't take any herbal supplement it will cause liver damage if you have liver disease tell your doctor and ask your doctor give you liver function test every 3 months even you're healthy person with no liver problem. The bottom line is your choice between your health conditions and Cymbalta personally I don't recommend to anyone. If your conditions worse nothing works except cymbalta go for it again that's your choice every one saying different things what ever is the best for you or your loved one.

I eventually did my own research on the web and discontinued this drug. It caused mydriasis - dilation of the pupils which makes eyes unable to focus.  It has some nasty withdrawal symptoms but after two months my eyes are back to my usual vision.  This was prescibed for fibromyalgia along with another antidepressant and other drugs.  I started having problems with my vision.  I could not focus in the midrange, like the shelf on a grocery store.  I saw my optometrist, got new glasses, they didn't help, got another pair and then another.  I saw an ophthalmologist who said my eyes were too dilated and prescribed pilocarpine drops, which were a nightmare, making my vision better for an hour or two at a time and worse the rest of the time, plus they caused headache and total night blindness. I asked the prescribing psychiatrist who could only tell me that ""blurred vision"" was listed as a side offect of cymbalta but also of several other meds I was taking.  I asked the ophthalmologist if my problem could be a side effect of one one my meds and he said no.  I did more research once I had a name for the problem - mydriasis - and found that it is a rare but noted side effect of cymbalta.  Unlike the people in the study the mydriasis got better after a couple of months off this medication.  Yes, my body hurts more without cymbalta and I have to take more of another antidepressant but I am so much better off without it.  Wish there had been more info available to me so here is my contribution."

I thought the antianxiety was responsible for tired feeling and lack of energy, so stopped that.

Doctor suggested trying about 15 months ago Cymbalta @ 60, and as most of these reviews state, its great. Happier than ever, calm, but very normal. Sleepiness returned, even more. Have gained about 15 pounds which may or may not be the result of Cymbalta. Have also noticed some pain in my knees went away...but never had treatment for it since it was never too severe, so maybe Cymbalta has nothing to do with that.

I still feel extremely tired a lot, sleep more than 8 or 9 hours and still want a nap. Lack of energy. It doesn't seem to be an effect of Cymbalta by the literature or other reviews, but nothing so far has shown up through other tests. I did suggest dropping dosage to 30, but after 2 weeks realized that wasn't a good idea as I lost the beneficial effects for depression (felt about same as when I was on Wellbutrin)and it did not ease the sleepiness. So I have maintained the 60mg dosage.  I almost always feel great so I am happiest ever to have this. However, I still wrestle with the fatigue, and actually feel little like exercising, etc, it really gets to me. Diet, vitamins are all good. I hide my laziness from others but my weight is starting to show. This side effect to me seems tied to Cymbalta. 

The new dilemna is this: my insurance told me that at the end of this year they will no longer provide insurance for Cymbalta and to seek alternatives. My doctor is aware but we have yet to create plan B. I cannot afford this, so will have to change. All these bad reviews have to do with withdrawing for one reason or another but the withdrawal is the horror story I will have to deal!"

I can never truly say that any of them helped but looking back, I did see intermittent improvements.  I then had a serious nervous breakdown two years ago when a co-worker (sibling) destroyed my career and reputation.  I have been unable to work since then.  I knew I needed help.  The referral to a Psychiatrist (PMD) seemed appropriate in view of my depression and suicidal thoughts.  My PMD increased the doses of Cymbalta and Welbutrin, kept the Trazodone the same but also added Lamictal, Ativan,  Deplin and Lovaza.  I am still here, thanks to much of his guidance. But, it has now been two years that I am on this medication regimen, and I have stopped taking many of the drugs on my own with the exception of the Welbutrin, Trazodone, and Ativan  which seem to work well together-at least in my case.  I stopped taking Lamictal, Lovasa and Deplin over two months ago and felt pretty good.  Cymbalta withdrawal was next as it has been my goal to take none of them, if possible.  My doctor had me go from 120 mg to 60mg per day.  I started seeing some side effects (discussing those with my PMD) but finally made my own choice to stop altogether. Cymbalta withdrawal has been a living nightmare.  I cry at the drop of a hat, suffer from horrible stomach problems, diarrhea, inability to eat and have wretched brain zapping. Lest we not forget the rash which any one of those drugs may have caused.  A rash so bad I have scratched and bitten myself to stop the itching. The itching seems to be tapering off slowly.  While trying to recover from a nervous breakdown, I have lost control of caring for myself.  Who survives Cymbalta withdrawal without more drugs? I am seeking a natural serotonin replacement which will not kill me. Thank you for allowing me to share my story.

I'm thrilled to function like a youngish woman again! Going back to work soon! I have only 6 fibro triggers, so that's not it, but this is helping with the muscle tear/nerve pain. Def side effects: dry mouth, weight loss (steady now but I'm real low in weight), orgasm not happening (boo), bruising, slightly higher bp, anti depressant is great cuz I was real down about chronic pain. Still take motrin around the clock, seeing a chiro to straighten mysel out and an exercise physiologist. Good luck!

Unfortunately, it also made me extremely suicidal and I ended up hospitalized for a week in the psych ward!! My doctor tried to off-set those side effects by adding Lamictal (guessing it might work like it does for bipolar), but it didn't help much. Cymbalta is quite nasty to stop using but after researching online, I was able to find a weaning method that worked MUCH better than my doctor's initial suggestions. I dropped from 80 to 40mg, then started opening the capsules and removing beads (there are about 180-200 in there). At the beginning, I went down pretty quickly by removing ten pellets at a time and holding steady for a couple days at each level. So for example I'd take capsules with 170 pellets for five days, then take capsules with 160 pellets for five days, and so on. I had to reduce much slower as I was getting closer to zero pellets. I had to start reducing by single pellets when I was around 40ish (I think) because I was noticing the brain fog & zaps when I was reducing by 2 then.

It took me almost a complete year to taper off completely this way, but I had almost no withdrawal symptoms! I've been med free for over a month and I haven't had any rebounds or residual effects. I strong encourage this method of weaning!"

So I stopped taking it. Through out the years the doctor's have tried all kinds of antidepressants on me and i learned in order to get off them to take another one for a few days and then discontinue, in my case i took prozac. so there was no withdrawl's for me. After having a stressful year and having my Fibro (along with other painful disorders) go into over drive I started taking Cembalta again. My Fibro was so bad that I could not move if i just mopped the floor, carried my gandchildren, picked up anything that caused a strain on my muscles. I would be in the bed for atleast 3 days before i could move without crying.I could not even walk up my steps anymore. I also had sever joint pain, and back pain. With the first pill of Cembalta I could tell a difference by 2 weeks no more pain! It does change your personality, and when i first take it I get like a high, this didn't happen when i took it the first time. I chose ""OTHER"" for this Review because I have everyone of the options and Cymbalta has stopped the pain and depression associated with all. To me it is a mircle drug. I have no side effects that I know of, unless its the small ""high"" after taking one. I take 30mg's daily. In the past I had tried the 60mgs but that made me sleep around the clock. Not sure what the difference is now and then except I take some other meds now that i didn't take before. So it maybe a interaction of some sort. but i would rather be high than sleepy. I've read the review's and I hate it that it doesn't help everyone the way it helps me. I to would like to say that make sure that something else isn't going on with you before you blame it on the Cymbalta."

The withdraw symtpoms after just 2 months of taking the drug are just as bad as the symptoms I had while taking the drug.  I do not recommend this from anyone. Bad, VERY BAD!!

Please please do yourself a big favor. Take it back to your doctor and tell him to go back to school. The FDA and agencies of other countries are assisting in Destroying people's brains and related bodily functions. SSRIs and meds like Cymbalta are most likely the original Cause of neuropathic pain, FMS and CFIDS.
Good luck to those of you who suffer from these man-made diseases."

How Eli Lilly can get away with not passing along strong warnings when people go off the drug.  Unbelievable side effects from withdrawal that I WILL report to the fda.  Wooshing when I just move my eyes, nausea, depression, headache.  Had to go to a compound pharmacy to make tiny amounts of cymbalta since they only go down to 30mg.

I never thought I'd feel 'human' again, but within a week of taking this medication I felt the best I'd felt in over 10 years!  No longer was the sofa my best friend. I actually had the urge to go out and LIVE life instead of just existing.
Sadly, my blood pressure began to rise, so my doc had to wean me off Cymbalta (OUCH!) and we played the med game again.  Which one was going to work?  For me, none did.  So, I made some life changes, started taking BP medication and he put me back on the Cymbalta. At my next visit, I actually hugged him for giving me back my life.  I cannot praise this medication enough.
Another added plus is that it removed the aches and Pains I didn't even realize I'd had before I went off it."

768$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$6/23/2013 12:24:28 AM$Reviewer: Nan, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$"A back injury gave me excruciating radiculopathy from my lower back to the outside of my knee. It took a series of three epidurals, with two levels each time to bring relief. The Cymbalta was added after the first epidural began to wear off after two weeks. It fully reduced the pain by the last epidural and allowed me to begin to resume my life. I was started at 30mg and did not need to go higher, the 30mg worked! I would have increased the dose if I'd needed too. My doctor was supportive of not increasing it if I didnt need it.
 The downside was a little nausea at first, and a little sweating and a little dizziness. The upside was tremendous!
 When it came time to let even the 30mg go
my doctor recommended that I taper off, by taking one every other day. As it turned out, by doing that, my level must have been dropping quickly because I would get nauseated when I took one. Then I emptied out a few little beads from the capsule and reduced the amount every other day. 
 Four days after I finished all the Cymbalta I had 'brain zaps'. Didn't know what that meant, as it is a side effect of reducing the dose. Annoying, worrisome, frustrating, unpredictable..after three weeks of being off it entirely, the 'brain zaps'stopped. Would I take this again? Yes, under the circumstances that nothing else was helping to relieve the nerve spasms. It really worked. I could sleep. Eat. Begin to get well enough to see 'normal' in my future. That kind of 'hope' is really important in healing."

785$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/8/2013 10:15:01 PM$Reviewer: Jon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$4$I have a history of depression, for which my psychiatrist has prescribed taking an antidepressant on a more or less permanent basis.  But my real reason for wanting to take Cymbalta is to prevent anxiety.  I think it's the best one I've taken.  I don't get any generalized/concurrent nervousness/anxiety with it, and I don't get any moments of panic either.  I just feel comfortable most of the time.  The downside I have with the drug concerns my sleeping.  If I slept well the night before, I get severe insomnia the next night and just want to stay up and enjoy activities all night.  So I am taking Trazodone for sleep at night, which helps.  But the Cymbalta also causes sleepiness during the day regardless of whether I did or didn't sleep well the night before and regardless of whether I took the Trazodone (it's definitely the Cymbalta causing it.)  So for that, I drink a lot of caffeinated drinks like tea during the day.  Thankfully, the caffeine doesn't negate the antianxiety effects of the Cymbalta for me.  I admit I don't have my sleep perfectly worked out, but with Cymbalta I don't feel worried or apprehensive about anything.

My pain has been chronic and worsening for the past three years I have been on cymbalta. My vision has deteriorated, I was exhausted, no interest in sex, headaches, dizzy, I could go on and on. Finally with no energy or concentration- I started weaning myself off with my dr.'s ok I have been counting beads since last July. I got to 40 beads of 260 in the 30 mg (started on 60 mg). Learned the hard way that half the beads in both sizes are sugar pill filler which explained why every day was a crap shoot as to how bad withdrawal symptoms would be each day. So my gp asked how badly I wanted off (badly) and prescribed Paxil to ease side effects. To my great joy I have been off cymbalta for four days- I get to wean off the Paxil in a few more days and will be clear of them all. My pain is lessened  I have still got headaches but thank god no zaps (those hurt). I'm still pretty exhausted but I have also had a lot of stress. 
If it is a suggestion you start taking this- do some research. Look into "" withdrawal of cymbalta"" there are so many support groups of people trying to get off this that FDA has started looking at Eli Lilly - it may be effective for some but it sure as hell wasn't for me. Approach with incredible caution.  My pain is so much better than it was that I feel like Lilly has stolen three years of my life"

It doesn't help any of the pain I experience. I had a severe panic attack and was suffering from derealization and, so, I was prescribed this. It took a year, or more, for the after effects of the panic attack to wear away and that happened, I think, on its own, not because of the drugs I was prescribed. The most annoying and disturbing side effects from Cymbalta are horrifying dreams. Every night I dread going to bed because my dreams are so stressful. It's like having a Tom Cruise mega-action flick going off in my head every night. I think the psychoactive drugs I'm taking, which includes Trazodone, have wrecked my sleep patterns.

Now my cholesterol is up, sugar is up and liver is never going to be the same... I would not wish this drug or a statin or any antidepressants on my worst enemy.  And please stay away from Tylenol as it is the worst for the liver. If you are taking any drug, have your blood take to check your sugar and liver ever month or two. Mine was normal and 3 months later, oops too late. 
Please have your blood monitored very often on these drugs if you like not having to take pills for your sugar or insulin and of course you need your liver.  My life will never been normal..

making me more depressed.  I have to confess that I have tried to get off this drug but the side effects i.e. brain zaps, feeling like I'm walking sideways, head fogginess, weepiness etc. has always forced me to go back on it.  Chronic pain and depression over losing my 
child is why I started it 6 years ago but if I could get off it I would. I was told that Krill Oil can help with easing the withdrawals.  Plus this medication is insanely expensive.

It helped with my Fibromyalgia pain and my depression though my mood was almost too even keeled on it.  I had a friend who said I was like a zombie on it.  Also, drinking alchol while taking Cymbalta is a very bad idea, not even a little bit of alchohol, no matter the proof.  The main reason I stopped taking it was because of the skin rash/lesions it caused which wasn't a well-known side-effect when I first started taking it.  Even when I finally did figure out the Cymbalta was causing my skin problems the doctors had a hard time believing me.  I had skin lesions that didn't heal for years and they were all over my legs and buttocks and a bit on my neck and arms.  It was horrible!  Nothing helped; I tried all kinds of creams, lotions, ointments, medicated and non-medicated.  A friend of mine said it looked like 'jungle rot.'  My skin started clearing up soon after I started weaning off of the Cymbalta and I no longer have the skin problems but I have numerous scars.

However, this small dose wasnt enough for me, more like a sugar pill. So I recently switched to Viibryd. This drug is okay, just felt some nausia (sp)? if I dont take it with food, and it works the same for me, as a mood stabalizer/anxiety pill. The only thing I have noticed it that over the past week the nightmeres started to come back. And I'm not talking ""white sheet ghost"" nightmeres. Like some down right twisted scarey shit that I didnt even know I had it in me to think up this stuff. I have been looking for people who have had similar sideeffects to cymbalta, but havent really found anyone who has had night terrors. "

I got small round red patches that skin would crust over like a scab and flake off of and if I did not use clotrimizole on it, it got redder and redder til it would bleed.  It itched and was painful. Unfortunately, the cause wasn't obvious, and for years I suffered with this. I went to 4 dermatologists who acted like they knew just what it was but their prescription didn't work. They all said not to use clomitrizole but it was my only relief. Finally, Dr. tried to increase my dose of cymbalta from 30 to 60, and then to 90 and the rash was worse than ever, and the lightbulb finally went on above my head. I stopped taking cymbalta very gradually because it reeked havoc with my stomache with each tiny bit I decreased. The rash was gone for the first time in years I didn't have one of those painful itchy spots.  I was without the rash for 3 months when my depression problems came back. I tried cymbalta again and the rash came back worse than ever.  I hope this helpful to anyone with skin problems of any kind. Test for yourself and don't put all your faith in doctors telling you it has nothing to do with your meds. And read side effects and warnings in more than one place. I had to read a lot of info til I found the warning in small print to discontinue if you get a skin flaming rash. I should have run across that warning a lot sooner.

1) that its half life time is so short.
2) that it is only available in 30mg and 60 capsules.

I started with 30mg in the morning in hospital (had a very deep episode) and it gave me some help with my agitation and panic attacks after a few days.
But it was not enough. I was very numbed and one of my key problems - anhedonia was very serve. After trying 60mg in the morning after some days I was sucidial with serve agitation and anxiety. After two weeks not getting better I went back to 30mg and after 2 days anxienty and agitation was gone again.
After 3 months I found my medication:
ONLY 7,5mg - 7,5mg - 7,5mg (have to open the capsule)
and 25mg Ritalin in the morning.

My old doc said that this dosage is not enough but i have tried it several times - with more cymbalta and with less cymbalta and everytime after some days things got really bad.
I have pleassure to work and some pleassure in activities with friend and one of the best things: My libido has returned after 3 years.
I take in addition to that 6,5mg Metafolin and 1,5g buffered vit c the day and I think this stuff works too! "

I restarted it in July and muscled through the first 2 weeks at 30mg and then bumped up to 60mg. I can honestly say it was worth sticking it out, because my Fibromyalgia is almost non-existent now. I still have problems with my Oseto Arthritis, however, Cymbalta has greatly minimized this pain. As far as any remaining side effects, it's very minuscule now and not bothersome enough to stop taking Cymbalta. My sex drive is normal, I have more energy, and I lost 25 lbs during the last 6 months of taking this medication. 

NOTE:  I also have hypothyroidism and take Levothyroxine. Believe me anyone who has an underactive thyroid knows how difficult it is to lose weight. Cymbalta did not make me gain weight or increase my appetite.  

My recomendation for anyone experiencing dry mouth, which I do still occasionally, keep a water bottle with you at all times. It really will help to keep you hydrated as well as help your kidneys and liver to function normally. Don't skip any doses, you will get shakey and feel like you stuck your finger in an electric outlet. I hope this helps anyone considering this medication for pain control. Good luck!!!  "

It worked really well but the side effects were just too much. The dry mouth was enough to drive me crazy and the excessive sweating was absolutely ridiculous. I'm recently post menopausal so little hot flashes would turn into soaked episodes which were very embarrassing. The dry mouth starting eroding the enamel on my teeth. My top, front, 4 teeth became rough and the enamel was disappearing faster than I could keep up with. I eventually broke off one of them and had to have a crown put on the 2 very front teeth. The insurance would only cover one but I wanted them to look alike so I had both of them done. It, also, seemed that I had some paranoia on this medication. I had extreme headaches for months after starting but we never associated the two. I weaned myself off of it and it was pretty easy when you go down as little as possible for a couple weeks at a time. I was pleased with the decrease in pain but this medication is an awful one for side effects!!

I use 30mg daily and it works fine.  I've since developed painful arthritis in my knees and am having trouble walking.  I saw the commercials about Cymbalta, so asked my dr. to try it on me.  I stopped the Prozac and began 30mg on Cymbalta for about 10 days, then went to 60 once a day.  I felt like it was a miracle drug!  I felt great, had NO pain, was able to walk up and down stairs without stepping sideways and holding onto the rail.  Then, I woke up one morning with terrible pain in my legs.  I asked my doctor if I could double the dosage, as I saw that 120mg was maximum.  He agreed.  The pain lessened for a few days, then was back with a vengeance.  I think it was even worse!  My neck was hurting constantly also.  Dr. had me stop Cymbalta and go back on Prozac.  I had no side effects from doing this but was only on it two months.  I never had problems with depression with this drug, but the pain was something else.  I've been on Celebrex for 2 days, but it's too soon to tell how it's doing....I hope this works, I can't live like this...I don't like to tell people not to take a medication, because for some people some things work well, and for others it's poison.  This was my experience.  The pharmacist said that I built up an immunity to it.

I've heard Lyrica is good too but my insurance won't cover it and it is even more expensive than Cymbalta.  Besides, who doesn't need an antidepressant these days?  Bonus.

I lost two jobs while on this medication.  I believe it was due to my outward appearance as well as my demeanor to my employer as a result of the drug.

I would sweat profusely and was always hot.  The medication caused me to stutter and shake like I was under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol.  I was easily agitated and did not care about others feelings and was self absorbed. I didn't have an appetite.  My dreams at night were like a Quenton Tarantino film.  I was a hot manic mess and would do things impulsively.

While I wasn't depressed on Cymbalta, the other side effects altered my life and work.  I burned many bridges."

It's itchy, flaky and also forming red blistering bumps. I've been to ER twice and to my Dr., and only on the 2nd trip to ER did they take me off it, give me visteril to help ease the itchy.

Prior to being put on a 30mg dose for 30 days, I could not sleep, eat, or go about my daily tasks without excessive panic attacks, heart burn, and fear.  Within the first few days of taking the 30mg dose, I felt more capable of life again, though still had moments of complete fear.  My doctor increased my dose to 60mg, which I have been taking since June.  Though I still have moments of anxiousness, I am able to think rationally and quickly dismiss the thought.
Some side effects are that are annoying (but tollerable) I have experienced are as follows:
Abnormal dreams--This was one of the first side effects I experienced.  I still get them when I am running low on sleep, but I accept them--it is better than sleepless nights!
Excessive Sweating--This happens at night, never during the day.  I will take up with completely soaked pajamas, but not feel warm.  It gets annoying, but again, I manage.
Weight gain--This is in conjunction with a birth control I am taking, but I have gained approximately 5lbs. above my normal weight since starting Cymbalta.  It's not a huge difference, but I prefer the relief over the weight issue, for sure!

Cymbalta is incredibly expensive, even with insurance.  For this reason, I'm counting down the days until I can wean off of it.  This impacted my satisfaction score--holy moly!"

I have had a problem with restless leg syndrome due to this med and take Merepex with it. I would be alot happier since it does control my pain if i didnt have rls. Biggest problem is that this med costs a fortune and i went into the medicare gap  the first of October. They say I will hit the gap every Oct with this exspensive med. So I couldnt afford it last month. I went into a bad depression coming off it and cried every day. Fortunately I was able to get some given to me this month and can make it again till medicare med kicks back in in Jan 2013. MY DR SAYS I AM HIS ONLY PATIENT TAKING 120ML WHICH IS ALOT. I think I got medicare disability when the judge saw how much I was taking of this med. When I went off last month cold turkey and now have started back I have personally cut my dose back down to 30ml a day again and am doing ok with that. I dont want to take the higher dose unless I need to again. Cant wait till this goes generic so the money is do issue. By the way I know alot of other family members taking this and everyone seems to love it for pain or depression isses. And you dont seem to gain weight from it like you do with Lyrica. Hope this helps.

Nothing noticed until 2 weeks after I'd been taking it.  Then a little mood boost on the surface only (still depressed deep down) and some anxiety relief as well as just more patience with people in general.  Side effects of increased appetite(but no subsequent weight gain) and abnormal sleep periods also began after 2 weeks but the sleep cycle got back to normal after another month.  Unfortunately after 2 months the mood boost and anxiety relief were gone and I was back to my normal levels.  Didn't pursue a dosage increase though in retrospect maybe I should have.  This is one of the few antidepressants out of many that I have tried that I would consider giving another shot to.

It was so wonderful to have rapid relief of the pain - not to have to roll out of bed because of the pain.  Then the side effects became a serious concern. The worst is the vivid, real-life, non-stop dreams that occur every night.  Also, I think I am having auditory hallucinations, hearing what sounds like a radio conversation.  My vision has become blurry, and I often have burning pain of my ankles at night that wake me up.  I am seeing my MD next week to get off of it. The dreams are wearing me out.  Too bad the pain relief was astounding.

I'll preface by saying I'm extremely sensitive to medication. Given time, Cymbalta does help lift your mood and dial down pain. However, I was only taking 20 mg tritrating up to 40 mg, and suffered numerous side effects: my brain never shut off - disruptive strange dreams felt like the TV had been left on in my head every night, plus nausea, fever/chills/sweating/achiness like flu (only first week), extreme drowsiness, blurred vision. Once I adapted, I stayed on for 3 months and did find relief, to the point I felt good enough to get off it. But when I needed it again 6 mos later, I only tried 20mg and had to quit after a week - I couldn't even go to the office. I felt like I'd been hit by a Mack truck. 

Cymbalta flattens out the mood to pleasant- no big highs or lows. I did not feel suicidal as they warn you might (only when I'm on no antidepressant do I feel that way!). But I wanted to feel like myself again; it was like watching myself from the outside, in a movie.

Be careful weaning off! Give your brain a chance to adapt slowwwly; never stop cold turkey! I've just been RX'd Elavil because I asked for something in low dose (10mg) in tablet form and can be cut in 1/2. You need to work with your Dr to find what's best for YOU."

I also had constipation, sexual problems, nausea, gained 15lbs., dry mouth and nasty taste in the mouth. I finally decided I'd had enough and took myself off of it.

De-realization poisoned every aspect of my life. My primary care physician found a psychiatrist who would take my health insurance and one of her associates got me on Cymbalta. Supposedly, it would do so much for me: relieve my anxieties, ease my osteoarthritis pain, blah, blah, blah..... I think the panic attack wore away by itself and the crap has never done anything at all for my physical pain. I have really, really ugly dreams that should be nightmares because there's a lot of anxiety and horror in them, but the tension is never resolved. I'm hooked on the goddam, lousy shit and no one will help me help me get off it. I was also declared ""depressed"" and ""bipolar"" at the time I was given Cymbalta and also prescribed Lithium and Trazadone. I kicked the Lithium, but I'm having trouble getting off Trazadone. I'm SO angry!!! I wasn't depressed when I went in for treatment and I'm NOT bipolar. I was sitting on the edge of mu chair, trembling, when I was first examined and put on these drugs, insisting that I just terrified and still they did this to me. Once when I, unfortunately, went without Cymbalta for three I became suicidal even tho' I knew it was just the drug talking.  "

Dizziness, vertigo, memory problem, tremors, and tingling sensations in my brain. I have never had withdrawal symptoms as bad as this from any other drug I've tried. I had to call off work because I could not drive.

Felt no emotions whatsoever, my pupils were constantly so dialated that I couldn't leave the house without people staring if they were close enough. After only the first 3 days, I could no longer achieve orgasm.  After stopping this drug after only 10 days, the side effects lasted for almost another 3-4 weeks. Yes, I should advocate for myself, but my physician never said one word about any of these debilitating side effects.  Although it helped the chronic arthritis pain, the other effects were overwhelming and my husband said I wasn't the same and I needed to get off the meds.  Other people were constantly commenting about my complete personality change.  I'll never take anything like this again; I'll deal with the pain or stick to OTC and ask more pointed questions of my doctor before I ever take anything again--this was a nightmare!!

Although seemingly effective for joint pain, the excessive fatigue, constipation and weight gain led me to request cessation of the drug.  My doctor quickly denied the weight gain (???), and suggested that I increased the dose.  Makes me wonder what kind of kick backs she was receiving. 
I say that the drug is not easy to use because I found that if I did not take it at the exact same time each day I experienced vertigo.  
It took me about 3 months to wean myself off of the drug, with vertigo and flu-like symptoms the entire time.  I have been off for about 6 weeks and now have an aczema-like skin condition which the dermatologist relates to the cessation of the drug.  Fortunately the fatigue is no longer an issue and oddly my joint pain is not as severe as prior to using Cymbalta.  
No doubt many people find relief with Cymbalta, but use caution.  The side affects are extreme.  "

It pretty much took care of the neuropathy in my knee and the anxiety attacks. Initially I had some nausea which went away in a few weeks. I also sweat much more than ever before, and have decreased sexual desire.  For that, I take a ""drug holiday, (i.e. one day off the med) and that seems to work okay.

The first two months it helped my pain but made me nauseous almost constantly.  Though I did lose 45 pounds when I started taking the drug, possibly a side effect from the medication combined with a lack of eating because of nausea.  In July of 2009, about 7 months after I began to take the Cymbalta, I began to have racing and suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, and a general feeling of going crazy.  When the doctor attempted to titrate me off the Cymbalta, these symptoms became worse and he decided to stop me cold turkey.  The mental side effects went away but I was bed ridden for a week with terrible pain, muscle twitches, and a feeling of electrical shock.  This medication worked well for a short period of time, but once it was built up in my system it was intolerable.

I have been bipolar for years and have used many drugs and this is the worst of all of them.  One night I started getting really confused while doing my job as a route delivery driver to retail stores.  I called my father who is elderly because I did not know what else to do and I was confused.  He called my employer and took me to the hospital.  It struck me as odd right off the bat that they put me in a room with a person with liver failure?  Then finally after days of testing a group of 4 doctors visited me before I was released and gave me the diagnosis.  I had hepatic encephalopothy  or water on the brain from a liver problem they claimed was caused by this drug.  While I made a full recovery I must say that when they say on the television ""liver problems sometimes fatal"" have been reported they mean it.  Of course the original prescribing doctor wanted to argue with the diagnosis of the 4 hospital doctors and I told him off and fired him in a dramatic way.  Now after years on meds for bipolar I must say I think this is the most dangerous drug I have ever taken and I cannot urge people enough to try other options before trying this drug.  Water on your brain is a sign of a failing liver and my doctors insist that this drug caused it. Thankfully there has been no permanent damage that is showing and my liver function tests are back in normal range.  I am afraid of this drug.   "

My insurance does not cover the medication, which I was already taking for a month when I learned that. The cost is prohibitive; at $200 a month. I started having other side effects while taking the medication; including fatigue. I decided for me it was time to stop; however, with just one missed pill; the horrendous symptoms of withdrawl began. I am nauseated; having episodes of diareah; and the worst part is this constant feeling of being in a fog, my brain quite literally feels like a flashing neon sign.

1161$Condition: Other$6/23/2012 8:50:14 AM$Reviewer: Karen55, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$This is a nightmare drug. I took it for osteoarthritis. It made me very ill. I suffered chronic flu symptoms, chills and fever, on a daily basis. Although it was a low dose it caused major memory and personality problems. Over the course of a year I experienced an unexplained 40 pound weight loss. After getting off this drug, I finally have an appetite again. Two episodes of extreme abdominal pain which were discovered to be due to an excessive blood lining in my uterus even though I am menopausal are now attributed to this drug as I found similar side effect reports on the FDA website. Withdrawal from this potent drug must be very slow as it is so addictive. My PCP had no idea this drug has such awful side effects.

The PHN (and the shingles pain) is the worse pain that I've ever experienced in my life, and I've had FOUR babies and multiple elective surgeries. With PHN, my nerves are on fire 24/7, and it never ends, unlike childbirth which does end, and you have a precious new life to show for the pain. Cymbalta has really helped my neuralgia pain, and I thank God every day for Cymbalta. I do have very vivid dreams on this medication. It's like watching a movie in the theater! This is fine with me because my nerve pain is better since I've been on Cymbalta. I believe that it has also helped the degenerative arthritis in the cervical and lumbar region of my spine which also hurts. I'm allergic to Neurontin and Lyrica. I had severe reactions to both of those, as in not being able to breathe. Thank God my physician finally put me on Cymbalta because it has really helped me. I've been on it for 2 years now with no problems.

I am in recovery from addictions so narcotic pain meds are not an option for me.  I was put on 60mg Cymbalta in 2009 and have been taking the same dosage for the last 3 years.  It took about 5-6 days for the pain to diminish.  It isn't completely gone but it does work wonders for pain.  Took a little bit longer (10 days or so) for me to notice the antidepressant effects.  Overall it has improved my life with little to no side effects  I do notice I sweat a little easier but it has not been in excess like most people seem to have had.  PLEASE NOTE if you miss 2 or more days of this medicine I get extremely dizzy and feel very odd in a bad way.

Every Doctor for the past 2 years told me the Remeron was supposed to help me sleep, but it kept me awake 2-3 hours after taking it.  It also stimulated my appetite 1 hour after taking it.  So it put 10 lbs on me.  When I changed pharmacies earlier this year due to my insurance, my new pharmacist told me Remeron can cause insomnia.

So I talked to my new doctor, and he prescribed Cymbalta.  But after taking it once today around noon with food, it made me very sleepy and just ""weird"" feeling in my head the rest of today.  I had to talk with clients on the phone today, and I had trouble getting my thoughts together and my words out to them... not good !

After the Cymbalta wore off a little about 4 hours later, then my anxiety kicked in.  So I have been taking Ativan for anxiety, but I played it safe today, taking only 1/4 of my 1mg Ativan, and even that small amount made me more sleepy and feeling weird in my head with the Cymbalta in my system.

Then I started feeling flushed in my head and chest.  So I am calling my Doctor tomorrow and I am not going to take anymore of it.  I just can't be that sleepy and ""out of it"" during the day due to my job.

I have also tried Wellbutrin for 1 month which caused major insomnia, and then it took 3 weeks to wean off of it which also caused ""rebound insomnia""... that is one very bad med, at least for me.

I also have tried Lexapro which didn't help.
I have tried Paxil, but stopped it after 2 days of very painful sexual side effects.

So I don't know what else my Doctor can prescribe for me.  I have felt so rotten for over 2 years now with little energy.
I started taking a year ago Vit D pills and increased the iron in my diet, as both levels were very low a year ago.  My recent blood test showed both levels are now in the normal range.

So I hope this posting helps someone else out there."

I was had to relocate my children with friends for a minimum of 2 weeks until she was under control.  things are better now, but not even close to normal.  This drug needs to be re-evaluated again as a treatment.  we were told my wife will never be normal again now that her manic attack happened.  this is by partial in our decision to get treatment from an md not a psychiatrist for what we thought was mild depression. if this is warns at least one person from taking this med, then it was all worth writing.  thanks for listening.

I started off with 30mg a day for the first week. I did have some side effects the first week, headaches, stomach uneasiness, dry mouth, sleepiness, and loss of interest in sex. But it was immediatley effective for the pain & my mood. I felt like a new person, and by the end of the week the side effects subsided except for the loss of sexual interest. I was upped to 60mg a day after week 1, and that made me unable to sleep so I just took it in the morning instead if at night, and was fine. However I was still unable to climax, and was not interested in sex at all. This was an absolute blessing for my pain and mood, however after taking it for a month, I decided to get off it because I am afraid the one remaining side effect will hurt my marriage. I still think this medicine is worth a try because if there's a chance you wont have any sexual side effects, its worth the risk. I did not have any withdrawal symptoms or side effects getting off of it. I returned to 30mg a day for a week while I was switching to Savella, which has done absolutely nothing for the pain and I feel horrible all over again. And so the search will continue for something that can help me.

Cymbalta has been helpful.  Unfortunately, I have gained 17lbs in two months.  That is a huge weight gain for me.  My cholesterol has also increased.  I am genetically predisposed to have low cholesterol and to be thin.  The weight gain and increase in cholesterol are very worrisome.  I am a pelvic mesh victim so turning off the sex drive is a blessing, for now.  I only take 20 mlg /day (a pediatric dose).  I hope I will only need the drug for 6 months.  I hope the weight gain will go away when I quit taking it.  I also hope the cholesterol will go back down when I quit taking it.  It is really sad when you need the drug to ease your anxiety because you need to have a god-awful surgery, yet it harms you in other ways. I couldn't face the surgery without Cymbalta and the surgery is ulitmately supposed to make things better.   To sum it up, the Cymbalta has really helped me cope.  For that I am thankful.

After a couple of days, I started shaking and my anxiety and panic attacks started getting worse.  She then put me on Prozac and that worked for about 10 days and then I had a really bad reaction.  I couldn't sleep; would pace the floor all night and day; started hallucinating and felt like I was going crazy; the end was the day I felt suicidal; I stopped and went back to my doctor.  She then tried Cymbalta (30 mg) and within a week I almost felt like my old self! We then increased dosage to 60 mg. and I am still on it.  It has made all the difference! I can now function again and haven't had a panic attack in almost three months.  Episodes of anxiety have also decreased greatly and everyone who knows me says I am my old self again.  I was in danger of losing my job, my sanity, and my life until I started taking Cymbalta.  It does take several weeks for it to really work well, but I have nothing but good things to say about it. It's not for everyone, but for me it is working great and I am very satisfied with it.

After the first 30 mg dose, taken as directed, I woke up the next morning with severe nausea and vomiting.  I had to miss work.

Both times I took 30mg and then increased to 60mg. The first time I took Cymbalta, it worked great with no side effects. When I decided to stop, I had really bad withdraws. It was aweful.  Since it worked so well, the next time I needed it (for mild depression and anxiety both times)I felt the withdraws would be worth it. I started out with 60 mg. and had bad side effects. I was flushed throughout the day. At night, I would wake up with sweats and seeing vivid flashes of light, hand tingling, and slight confusion.  I decreased to 30 mg. I still had the side effects but they only lasted a couple of nights. The flushing still happens and I get hot easily.  I have increased to 60 mg. and I am not getting any side effects except for slight flushing.  I am about to visit my doctor to stop taking Cymbalta again due to it not working as well this time for my depression and anxiety.  It is also very expensive if you do not have insurance or have a HSA like I do.  My opinion is that when it works, it works great, but if you experience side effects, it may not be worth it.

I have tried over twelve medications.  I also take this medication for neuropathic pain.  I've had type 1 diabetes for 23 years.  I haven't noticed a significant reduction in pain.  Lyrica is a medication that helps my nerve pain. The only side effects I've
noticed is reduced sex drive and some ED.  I'm taking Viagra to treat this side effect and well worth taking, even with this side effect.  Be sure to start low and build up.  Some Dr's just don't get this!  I take 3 20mg tablets daily.  I can tolerate the medication better when taken in 2-3 doses daily.  I had a headache when taking 30mg or 60mg once daily.  I could tolerate taking 2 30mg at this point.  I've taken Cymbalta for 5 years.  

The medication is expensive, but covered by my insurance.  I took Paxil for 8 years and found Cymbalta a much more effective drug.  "

I will admit I have researched CYMBALTA on WEBMD prior to this expose and I determined a person could actually take approximately 300mg a day of CYMBALTA, however, there was no way to determine how severe the ""side effects"" were (or are), as I did my ""OWN"" evaluation of increasing my CYMBALTA every three (3) days by one (1) 60mg capsule.  When I finally reached 300mg a day (FIVE 60mg CAPSULES A DAY), I did feel significant reduction in my Neuropathy pain.  I am very interested in knowing if ELI LILLY has compiled any evaluations of this type and if so, what their results were when taking 300mg a day or more?  You have my permission to delete any information you desire of my experiences with CYMBALTA.  I do take two (2) other Mental Health medications in addition to my two (2) 60mg of CYMBALTA a day.  I will be gratefully appreciative if you can have someone from ELI LILLY communicate with me to discuss my experiences with CYMBALTA.

Before I began taking it (approximately 4 years ago), I had a doctor who had me on 3 benzodiazapines for anxiety all at once...I decided enough was enough! I wasn't living my life, I was void of emotion. I decided to detox from the benzos. I went to a different doctor and was started on Cymbalta for my anxiety and depression. It was rough at first. I was nauseated and felt sick, but I I started taking it in the morning with protein, and the nausea and headaches stopped. The Cymbalta has decreased my panic /anxiety attacks far more than Xanax or Ativan ever did.  For the first time in a long time, I realized, that it's actually good to feel bad sometimes, because you're actually ""feeling.""  
My husband and I are thinking about starting a family, and I'm a little nervous to stay on Cymbalta during pregnancy, but we'll see if the benefit outweighs the risk.

I then spoke to the pharmacist and   the Doctor on call and fortunately both agreedit was the increase in the dosagge that was causing all the problems.So I have only taken one 30mg pill since then and I am beginning to get back to normal > But please remember that increasing the dosage can cause some pretty significantly uncomfortable side effects.

I can understand why drug addicts kill for a fix.  With that said, I started out at 30 mg which worked wonders for the fibromyalgia pain in like days.  about 2 months into it, I had a serious car accident(not sure if the meds had any thing to do with it or not).  Plus some other anxiety issues which overwhelmed me.  the doc upped the does to 60mg(recommended for most fibromyalgia pt).  I spent the 2 weeks in bed with severe nausea and just zoned out.  my mind went on a vacation.  I just didn't care and was tired all the time.  I had no motivation for anything, no opinion.

The withdrawal effects sucked.  there is no other word to describe it. Hypersensitivity, a manic phase, was my experience.  I suggest if this drug is started, DO NOT get off it.

Last 6 months: depression cloud has snuck back in, sex drive still dead, wake up early for no reason and can't go back to sleep, foggy headed, forgetful, spacey, last week I determined it is time to find a new drug.

First, the doc tried giving me an SSRI, but I refused to take it. I'm not depressed, I just have a hard time dealing with stress and anxiety. I took my first dose last night & didn't feel any different immediately. Although, I didn't know what to expect. I didn't sleep a wink last night. I was up every hour in the bathroom. Today, I feel dizzy and disoriented. I've been throwing up all day. I've never been suicidal or had suicidal thoughts, but last night I kept thinking about what it would be like to shoot myself. I wasn't wanting to do it, but was just thinking about it. I'm calling the doc today. I don't want Xanax for my anxiety - it's too addicting. I just want to feel normal again.

The drug has helped for the tingling feeling feet/hands lower legs, it does not help for complete loss of feeling. It's side effects are complete loss of sexual activity.(severe ED and frustation) It has helped with the severe mood swings and severe anxiety(almost to the point of giving up)But have noticed that at time of high stress that by the time it ""kicks in"" you sort of go into a flat-numb emotion zone for hours.(I am on 120mg/day dose) Also I have found out that you can group all Law Enforcement into the (BUGS BUNNY ""WHAT A BUNCH OF MAROONS"") catagory! I have been checked in airports,TMA and DEA, and Local cops ( after altercation in parking lot door dinger,related to local prosecutor) That stated I was acting under the influence and showed signs of Under Influence, even though I did not feel that way! However I am now forced to go to court ordered drug monitoring KAPS-Kentucky to someone that did not even know , what kind of drug this was,and /or is used for, other than he has seen it advertised on TV!LOL Overall it does not seem to prevent what it was prescribed for it just sort of knocks the top off of it !

I am now trying to find a good ""mood stabilizer"" with my doctor. Had 2 MD's explain to me that mood stabilizers are first line of treatment and THEN the anti-depressant. My treatment has been backwards, only b/c I failed to be honest w/practitioner and didn't tell her I had been diagnosed in past w/Bipolar. So tell your MD eveything. Although I have been told to stop the Cymbalta and ONLY take mood-stabilizer, I just can't and won't give up my cymbalta.

So called ""dangerous drugs"" work for me and Cymbalta made me forget who I was.  We need to tell these pharmacuetical companies we're not guinee pigs and there are no long term side effects for this drug except that other SSRI's and SNRI's are turning out to cause birth defects. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS DRUG if you're not used to SNRI's or SSRI's. I have taken Paxil, prozac, wellbutrin, and 5htp is the best working serotonin thing i take. I also take subutex now for pain in luei of opiates but still rely on xanax for anxiety. Cymbalta dropped my functioning from a 6 to a 4. Opposite of helpful."

Not sure if it ever helped my depression problem or if changes in my life were really the culprit. Anyway I was remarried a year ago to the most wonderful woman who is a lifelong nurse and suggested I try to come off the cymbalta. I tried decreasing to 90 mg and after about 4-5 days was met with terrible brain shocks and just an awful overall feeling physically and mentally. I went back on 120 mg so we went to a neurologist who suggested I alternate days between 120mg and 90mg. Perfect! Never a bad day. I did this for one month, then started only 90mg a day and have not had a problem. (started 90mg daily two weeks ago) Our plan is in two more weeks to start alternating days of 90 and 60mg. Yeah!!! It will take time but I will eventually be off this stuff. The side effects while not horrible, are numerous for cymbalta. Mine are: Non-existent sex drive, difficulty urinating(not prostate problem), fatigue, sleepiness, vivid dreams, lack of any drive. God sent me my the most caring and understanding support system, my wife, and that has helped ten-fold. I wish anyone wanting to quit this drug the best and please come off slowly. That's the key.

However, after about four or five months on this drug my erection was hurting me and was actually starting to curve down. My penis has aiways been in an up position when erect but after being on this med it is turning down now and is hardly an erection at all. I have never had problems in my sexual life until I took this drug. even after being off of it for more than two years my erection, or what little of it there is , is still very small and curved down. I wish I could turn back time and have known about this side-affect. I would never have taken this drug. My deppression now is more about not have any kind of sex life. I am ashamed of the size of my erection now. My erection was once very large and would never have a problem satisfing a woman. I am now too embarresed to even try having a relationship with a woman. If there is a way to fix this problem I wish someone could tell me. This is the worst I have ever felt in my entire life, not being able to have a sex life has been very tramatic for me.

I also have occasional anxiety problems. The cymbalta helped greatly with the anxiety. I don't think i could get upset, however it did nothing for the pain. I take 60mg a day and have to in the morning or I can't sleep. I have also had some muscle twitching and problems with vision that come and go.

Was given it instead of Pristiq because I was getting massive migraines from the Pristiq (I took it for a whopping week)  Cymbalta has done a lot for migraines and headaches, and makes me feel less depressed and anxious.  I was started out on 60mg and after a few weeks started getting edgy and irritable.  Doc had me go back to taking Abilify 2mg along with the 60mg Cymbalta and it seemed alright for a while, but I drive for a living and also live 45-60 minutes from the garage I start out of each morning, and was having trouble with falling asleep while driving!  I dropped the Abilify and they had lowered my Cymbalta to 30mg and so far so good.  I feel alright, mostly normal, the only issue I have is if I miss a dose, about half way through the next day I start getting major dizziness and motion sickness.

1326$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$2/1/2012 8:44:57 AM$Reviewer: R Vogel, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$4$"I have taken Cymbalta since early 2010.  It has really helped with my depression.  I have also attended counseling.  However, I have suffered from severe periods of nauseau and upper stomach pain.  IT is so bad that I have been to the ER several times.  (Usually treated like I am having drug withdrawls...not fun!!!)  I ended up having ulcers, gastritis and having my gall bladder removed. (Which seemed to be the problem...)  However, the periods of nausea, upset stomach and sickness are still very bad. The surgey was 3 months ago.  I am very careful what I eat.  My ulcers have cleared- but still have gastritis- inflammation of the stomach...The only other medication that I take on a regular basis is Protonix- to help heal ulcers and inhibit stomach acid production.   

I have found that taking 60 mg of Cymbalata on an empty stomach - makes me feel very hot, sweaty,my stomach knots up. and usually it is so bad that I throw-up!!  It seems like taking a split dose of 30 / 30 creates less stomach upset.  However, I have to watch taking the 2nd 30 mg too late in the day or I have trouble sleeping.
I have to say I am very worried about the effects that Cymbalta has on my body and I think it would be smarter for me to find another medication for my depression.... 

After reading rare side effects- I have seen nausea, stomach pain warnings and wonder about Cymbalta's effect on liver.  Through the years- I have taken antidepressants on and off for 25 years- so, I have been on most- (forgive my spelling) TCA's, prozac, zoloft, paxil, lexapro, effexor.. also combo trials with abilify, zyprexia, lithium, geodone, etc.  My problem doesn't seem to be a bipolar issue- more depression. Cymbalta seem to work best- as a stand alone-  I am still investigating..

It everything she ate or drank burned it. after three weeks of this I finally put two & two together and figured out it was the Cymbalta that was causing it. I backed her off of the medicine and her tongue & speech returned to normal again.

I took ALL of the antidepressants since 2002. My doctors took me off everything all at once and I had a break down.  They put me on Zyprexa and I didn't have pain for 3 years.  I went off Zyprexa and my fibro came back.  My doctor gave me Cymbalta.  At first it was like a miricle!!!  After 2 months my fibro came back, only worse!  My doctor said to take two a day.  It was like a miricle again!  But then got even worse!  My doctor said to take three a day.  My muscles and tendons were as HARD AS STEEL!!!  I was in so much pain, could not move, wanted to kill my self!!!  This went on for 5 months!!!  My husband saw the Cymbalta commercial.  It said it ""might make your muscles cramp""!!!  So I went down one pill, got better, went down another pill, got even better!!!  Went off, and now my fibro pain is manageable!!!  Now I will NEVER TAKE AN ANTIDEPRESSANT AGAIN!!!  You must NOT eat processed foods and you MUST sleep 8 to 9 hours a night!!!  But now I only have to take half a norco to one norco two times a day!!!  Before I was taking 6 pain meds, 6 norco a day!!!  The key is to sleep!!!!!  DR. OZ explained that the HGH is replenished AT NIGHT WHEN YOU SLEEP!!!!  So you must go to bed around 9pm!!!  I used to stay up all night in pain and it would only get worse.  You must sleep!!!!  Able to have a life now!!!  You have to be your OWN DOCTOR and try different things!!!  Streching is soooo helpful!!!  I went through 10 years of being an EXPERIMENT for all the doctors!!!  Don't put your self through this!!!!!"

We initially tried 30 mgs a day while weaning off the Celexa. Once on Cymbalta alone I  noticed that some improvement but not enough. We increased to 60 a day and my sense of well being improved gradually over 5 or 6 months. I've been on Cymbalta now for about 8 months and really feel the most 'normal' that I've felt in over 5 years. I've regained focus, I hvae the desire to do things I haven't felt up to (i.e.: exercise, enjoy hobbies...)in years. 

The major side effect for me is excessive sweating or hot flashes. It can be a little off putting but not enough to make me want to switch at this time. I also experience 'brain zaps' if I miss my dosing time by more the 24 hours. Of late I've had a sour milk taste and dry throat; however, I'm hoping that has more to do with an atibiotic I had to take after oral surgery I recently had. 

Over all I'm pretty satisfied with my experience thus far on Cymbalta"

1362$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$1/8/2012 3:04:55 AM$Reviewer: SonnyZ, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $1$1$3$I was on Cymbalta for about five years and developed major problems that I did not realize were side effects for quite a while.  I experienced increased blood pressure, tinnitus, heart palpitations, muscle spasms, muscle rigidity and pain, muscle weakness, loss of short-term memory, increased depression, loss of interest in activities I had been passionate about my whole life.  I weaned myself off the medication and after a year I almost have my body back.  Muscle strength is returning, memory is back.  I have mood swings worse than before I went on it and still not much interest in my hobbies and activities.  That drug was a nightmare and should be banned.  I am convinced it caused a chemical imbalance in my brain rather than treating it.  I will never take this drug or any like it ever again.  
1363$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$1/7/2012 9:35:38 PM$Reviewer: Lost In Limbo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$I was recently diagnosed with having something similar to Guillain-Barre Syndrome. After having bouts of numbing, tingling and weakness my neurologist suggested that Cymbalta may help me get through some of the symptoms. After taking this drug for a week my symptoms had basically gone away and I was able to function normally once again.On top of that my mood had improved making coping even easier. I should also tell you that I also have a cyst on my left ovary, which added to extra symptoms consisting of pain in my groin & armpit due to swelling of lymphnodes, as well as pain in the area of my left ovary from swelling. The Cymbalta helped quite a bit and by the third week my excess symptoms we completely gone. There is no cure for Guillain-Barre Syndrome(which is a disorder that affects the nervous system) and it seems to be fairly unknown why it does what it does to the body. After completing a one month trial after being on a full dose for 3 weeks, I had thought that my symptoms would stay away. But a week and a half after finishing they have started to return, but so far not as not as strong as when I first became sick 3 months earlier. I feel that if I were to continue taking this drug for another month or so I might find myself healthy again. In the meantime- since there is no cure, masking the symptoms with this drug is better than suffering through them without.Cymbalta is made mostly for being a mood enhancer and helping with pain associated with fibromyagia and other nerve pain, since I mostly had numbing and strange sensations in my body I was surpised at how well it helped, so I'm writing this for people who are in the same boat as I am, who wouldn't ordinarily know about this medicine. It has totally saved me and gotten me throught the holidays as they were excrutiatingly busy. As for side effects, I had trouble with my eye sight the first week, some nausea,and slight dizziness. Be Strong- If It's Happening To You Don't Lose Hope- It WILL Get Better.

Even tho I'm diabetic, the  neuropathy was from extensive chemo and 1 year of Interferon A.(Level 3 malignant melanoma (metastatic). 12 years ago. Yes, I'm a survivor! I never had depression or took antidepressants. The neuropathy is bearable, but most painful in the PM. However, I'm concerned about the side effects.  ?????? At present I have wet macular degeneration in both eyes....Would cymbalta thin the blood or
cause tissue break-down???? This is my main concern.

At first I was in heaven w/ cymbalata for helping in the depression/mood swing area. No help that I noticed for back pain. Now,though I can relate to 90% of ALL posted side effects. What brought me here today  was my searching for answers in alot of the side effects I and my wife have noticed for a long time now. I have the MOST VIVID strange,nightmares you would not believe. They are so real,life like and absolutely chilling. When I wake even if its only been a couple hours of sleep I donot want togo back to sleep what so ever. I also have very bad day terrors of suicidal thoughts. I had at one time such a zest for life. A very active life in so many hobbbies I couldnt keep up. A Love for my family and friends that was boundless. I thourghly believe the after effects of being on cymbalata for such a pro long time is the cause of all these issues. I very rarely speak out on my issues but in this instance I felt an obligation to my fellow peers to share my expierence of using this drug. For those of you that are having great results, god bless you and your pains I know what a relief you must find. for those of you doing research please please talk this over in depth before taking the next step. Anyone wanting to ask me anything further on my use of cymbalta for any reason please email me at [email protected]

1379$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$12/21/2011 4:17:31 PM$Reviewer: Moon, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$"   Though it made my oxycodone more effective and allowed me to take less, after a while I noticed myself becoming lethargic and depressed, then almost manically enthusiastic, the difference from one day to the next. And within three months of taking Cymbalta I had gained ten pounds, even though my diet was exactly the same. 
   One day I was so depressed I almost started crying, then I thought about my medication: I was taking 30mg of Cymbalta with 15mg of oxycodone each morning. So I stopped completely. So far I've had no withdrawal, and my mood has become cheerful and even-keeled again. 
   It seems counter-intuitive to have an anti-depressive actually cause depression and manic moods, but I think this was a very insidious side-effect that took several months to notice. I hate to give it up but the depression and mood altering effects were worse than the pain."

(suffered from major depression, suicidal ideation, & self mutilation). Tried welbutrin, lexepro, & celexa. Cymbalta side effects for me: occasional stomach upset/burning; Tums relieves this, also omeprazole. I do get flu like symptoms (body aches/fatigue) if I miss a dose or am late with a dose.  For me, the best time of day to take Cymbalta is at noon; bedtime dose kept me awake at night, morning dose made me sleepy in afternoon. I am so very happy I gave Cymbalta a try.  I have been taking it for 9 months now.  I recently started taking taking clonazepam for anxiety and it does not seem to interfere with Cymbalta.

Was on the generic effexor 100 mg since my insurance stopped paying for brand. Just was not working. My doctor had me take 50 mg of effexor (venlafaxine) along with the 30 mg of Cymbalta for 7 days. Then I started my 60 mg last night and will not be taking the eddexor. My question is to anyone who might can answer is: Does it matter if you take this med at night or should I take it every morning. I've always taken my anti-depression meds at night. Based on what I've read about this med it can also help with other types of problems such as low energy. I was dianosed with cancer 4/2004 and received chemo treatments two times pretty much back to back since my cancer came back a second time. I am now about 5 1/2 years in remission (Thank GOD), but I have had so many medical problems mainly from the chemo and 5 surgeries in 6 years with my last surgery 6/10. My energy level is so low and nothing I seem to do helps. Would appreciate any feed back. Thanks inadvance.

After that I felt like I was okay. Took this med. for 9 weeks total. It worked really well for 6 weeks and then I started getting mood swings, irritable and felt like I was losing my mind. I was taking the lowest dose so when I ran out I stopped. It was terrifying to feel myself so angry and mad at the people I love. I started to have really bad thoughts like how my kids and husband would be better off if I was dead. I have never been suicidal but the way I felt at this point was really scaring us! Getting off of it wasnt as bad as I anticipated, I was a bit nauseous the following day. It has been a few days now and I finally feel normal again. Also noticed a few times while on this drug my heart was racing, it didnt happen for more than a couple of minutes but that was enough for me. All I can say is BE CAREFUL and watch out for anything that seems off. Dont isolate yourself, stay in close contact with your family and friends and tell them if you start getting worried.

That was almost five years ago. The problem is trying to quit the medication. The side effects are so severe that it is easier to just keep taking it. The brain zaps are unbearable and it makes me feel as though I am losing my mind. Confusion, naseau and dizziness also. I can not emphasize enough about the brain zaps though. If your doctor recommends or prescribes Cymbalta, please think twice about it. If I had to do it over again, I would NEVER have taken it. Sad thing that the Dr. never warned me about the side effects. They must get a huge kickback from the drug manufacturer. Again, please think twice before taking!

I DO feel so much better after being on Cymbalta into my 3rd month now.  Have been able to start back to walking every day (if I can just keep that up!)A year ago, I was so bad with hurting in my legs, feet and ankles with extreme fatigue that I couldn't go to the grocery store without being incapacitated for the rest of the day.  So, being able to be more physically active is a BIG plus.  HOWEVER, I've have GAINED 18 pounds since May!!! What's up with that??  I can go from appetie okay, yeah I'm a little hungry, but I can handle it; then in a few seconds I go to being ravenously hungry and wanting to eat anything in sight.  Then yesterday, my MD tells me the weight gain is a side effect I'm not going to be able to get rid of while I'm on the Cymbalta - WHAT?!?!??!  So now I guess I'll weight 275, but hey, I'll be able to walk and get around better!!  I just wonder if that's a better trade-off from what I was in May when I finally got desperate enough (again) to start taking something for the horrible aches and pains of Fibromyalgia.  I tried  Lyrica but had so much edema in my legs and ankles my normally skinny legs looked like piano legs!  Hey, drug companies pay attention; give us a pain relieving pill for Fibro that actually works and doesn't make me suicidal or gain 50 pounds, I'm already big, I can't affort to gain any more weight!!  Guess I have to decide that either/or question of whether I want to be able to function or be really fat which doesn't seem to be too great a trade-off to me; then my joints really get shot and I have heart disease!!  What to do??

I also suffer from Fibromyalgia, and before this med I could only go from the bed to the couch each day and dreaded having to get up to do anything at all because of the pain.  Now I have my LIFE back again. I feel human, and can do things I want to do without feeling pain, my depression is under control (I'm happy), and my anxiety is at a stand-still without having to take other meds that make me feel doped-up all the time.  I'm aware that some of these reviews may scare you away from wanting to try Cymbalta, but I have never even heard of a ""brain zap"", and never experienced any of the things these people are talking about. Different meds work differently for different people, and Cymbalta just may be RIGHT for you, like it is for ME!  So, don't shy away from it because of these other reviews.  It truely is a wonderful, lifesaving med, and I'm so thankful for it.  I'm alive again, painfree, and happy! Best of luck to you and May God Bless you like he has me. "

Not long after starting I kept having these episodes feeling like ""brain zaps""As soon as I lay down at night the zaps would start. Then they started to occur during the day. If I missed a dose the zaps would be worse. My PCP took me off of it about a month ago and the ""brain zaps"" haven't stopped but they're not a bad or often. A few days ago one morning I was about to get out of bed and all of a sudden I heard a sound like quickly letting air from a balloon. It was so scary; I got up quickly and walked around to make sure I was okay. Long story short I drove myself to ER because The right side of my face & neck was feeling very tight, weak with severe pressure. Oh yeah I have RA, Fibromyalgia and a pinched nerve in my neck[worse on right side]. I was admitted in the hospital because they wanted to run tests[ CT, 3 MRI tests, Ultrasound on my neck & heart]to see if maybe I was having a stroke or aneurysm. My mom died [49 yrs old]from an aneurysm and my older sister had 2 aneurysms that was caught in time to have surgery. After all the tests they could not find anything which I am so very glad to know because I had been telling my PCP & my husband that there is something wrong in my brain. I am no longer on Cymbalta but this episode of ""brain zaps"" really scared me. I pray that if anyone that reads this review and are having symptons such as this please tell your PCP so you can be weaned off this drug. I was weaned from 1[20mg]capsule 2 times a day to 1 time a day until I was finally taken off. My experience with Cymbalta has been very very very SCARY. "

When starting, my doctor began at 30mg per day for a week then upped the dosage to 60mg per day.  With in a week I noticed decreased pain.  Being that I took this medication before, I know that there is a period of time that your body needs to adjust to the medication.  I suffered sleepiness, yawn, dry mouth and constipation.

As for OCD- there was a slight diminishment in OCD symptoms but basically cymbalta just made me feel numb, dazed and like sleeping all the time.  It's recommended for depression but I don't know how effective it is for that because I actually felt a numb, dazed, depression on it.  I felt so tired I could barely do the daily essentials.  AND...THERE REALLY SHOULD BE A WARNING ABOUT WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS....EVEN AFTER TAPERING OFF SLOWLY I'M HAVING A HORRIBLE TIME....haven't slept in weeks and when I do fall asleep for a few hours in the early morning end up having horrible nightmares and start screaming, my husband has to wake me up just to get me out of the nightmare, experiencing terrible irritability almost bordering on rage and I'm not a hostile person by nature so it's very frightening - it feels like you're going crazy...horrible restless leg feeling, feel like crying all the time, feel like I can't breath, terrible headaches, dizziness and lightheaded, twitching eyes, feel exhausted and restless at the same time.  IT SHOULD BE IMPERATIVE FOR THE COMPANIES THAT PUT OUT THESE DRUGS TO INCLUDE A WARNING AND ALSO SUGGESTIONS SUCH AS SUPPLEMENTS AND MAYBE A MILD SEDATIVE TO HELP WITH WITHDRAWAL.  I will call Eli Lilly to report my experience.  I had been on effexor and clonazapam before that for 2 years, had some withdrawal but nothing this severe - the clonazapam may have actually helped with effexor withdrawal but my practitioners did not want to give me clonazapam this time because they claim it's addictive....didn't have severe withdrawal from clonazapam, looks like cymbalta appears to be more the addictive withdrawal experience.  There must be a better answer to depression/anxiety disorders.  From much of my research I'm discovering that the thyroid, adrenals and our whole endocrine system can have a major effect on the functioning of the brain.  Pray that MD's recognize this!

Not literally but it has made my life barable.  I had so much pain in all of the joints of my body I felt like crying 90% of my day.  Cymbalta has significantly reduced the pain and has helped my mood.  Being in pain 24/7 can really get a person down.  I would highly recommend this medication to people suffering from fibromyalgia.

It helps me with my anxiety and I have noticed that when I miss a day the fibromyalgia pain becomes worse, so it helps with that as well. The only downside is a HUGE one: withdrawals. Can't afford to refill your prescription for a few days? Trying to wean off? Get ready to go through HELL. Look it up online, there are entire websites dedicated to the godawful withdrawals of this drug. Be cautious and ONLY begin this treatment if you think you will be on it long term.

I started taking cymbalta about 4 years ago and FINALLY!! There is a drug that works for me! I am ""me' on this medication. Yes it does increase your appetite a bit, and if I miss a day or two then I pay for it because my mood becomes irratic...but overall this drug is a lifesaver. I can function. My husband and I are going to start trying to conceive in the next year so I am tapering off the 60 mg to the 30mg, and then off of it before we get pregnant...but I plan to resume taking it as soon as I am done breastfeeding.
Not every drug works the same for everyone. Prozac made me suicidal, and lexapro made me FAT, there are always pros and cons to ANY medication...but for me, cymbalta has saved me and my relationships at time."

Since starting it, I have had erratic blood glucose readings (I am diabetic), unrelenting diarrhea, excessive sweating and a few episodes of Restless leg syndrome, which I've never had before.

My doctor wants me to take this along with an anti seizure medicine that will dampen my sensitive nerve's overreaction to every stimulus. AND she wants me to gradually reduce my opiate therapy and wean off completely within 4 months. I am frightened, but so disabled by pain at this point that I'm willing to try anything. I feel like I have no life now. Can't work, can't go to school, can't travel very far, avoid activities outside of home. I can't even keep my house clean.

I don't recognize the person I am when I hurt this much, and I don't know how to get 'me' back.

I'm going to stay on Cymbalta and the other med changes in hopes of some relief.

Still waiting for Social Security disability to kick in after three years.

If I feel well enough to have a life again, I would be happy to withdraw my claim. This may sound crazy, but if I could work again, I would be so happy.

People need to be aware of what this drug can do to you. The company or companies that supply this drug purposely hide the truth from the public about this drug and others like it. I was on Cymbalta 60mg for about 2 years and the symptoms got so bad i had to quit taking it and the withdrawal from this drug is one of the worst and i almost had to go to the hospital several times. These drugs can make your symptoms worse and even add new ones. I would advise anyone not to take them without weighing the risks and determining yourself whether your symptoms are bad enough to risk taking a dangerous medicine like Cymbalta. The withdrawal from this medicine is terrible, getting off this drug is said to be like getting off a narcotic. The withdrawal i went through made me wish i had never come into contact with this medicine or any like it. It was the worst week and a half of my life and i would do anything to never have to go through it again.

I have been off of it for a month now, and feel much better.  I guess that's a lesson in humility!

This was such a scary experience I looked up side effects and drug interactions and learned I hadn't been warned about any of these. I called my doctor to inform her I would no longer be taking this medication as I believe the risks far outweighed any benefits. My heart was racing so fast I thought I was having a heart attack and with the profuse sweating and nausea, I was ready to call for an ambulance!

At first my depression was undercontrol with the cymbalta my doctor had me on a 60mg dose once a day but i kept having symptoms of a heart attack so i went back to 30mg and eveything turned to normal with my depression. WEll 1 week later i am crying, fighting with everyone, feeling really depressed like lonliness and everyone wanting no to be around me, my family and i have been torn apart because of my fibromyalgia, which i believe even after 7 doctors i am misdiagnosed. My family  thinka im a pil popper, and every conflict we have its because of the pills that they can throw in my face. I dont have any support from them with my illness because they are sick of hearing about poor me poor me. I dont know what else to do :((

In the beginning I had only minor side effects and they went away after a few weeks. The one side effect that has never gone away is a slight upset stomach right after swallowing the pills. I think this is due to the fact that the pills float. It takes a little getting used to swallowing floating pills. Overall I am very happy with this medicine. It has been the best medicine for me that I have ever tried. I also financially qualify for patient asisstance from the manufacturer so I get my medicine with no charge. Just a few forms to fill out. There is no, one-right-medicine-for-everyone, out there so if you try this medicine and it doesn't work for you just keep trying with your doctor to find one that does. I've tried ones that seem to have no effect and others that make me soooooo sick I think I'm dying I'm in so much pain. Cymbalta has worked for me and I intend to continue taking it for a long time.

To begin with it was extremely helpful with my moods and general feelings of depression. It has now become less affective and I am looking for an alternative. I experienced the normal symptoms of feeling like I would vomit (but never did) for approximately 8 months that subsided eventually. I also get what is referred to as 'serotonin' dreams where I have extremely vivid and life like dreams due to this antid. I hate this of course as it often leaves me waking up wondering if I recovered a memory instead of knowing I have just had another dream. This disheartens me greatly as I lived with depression for a number of years due to previously trying a number of antid's and getting hideous side effects until I tried Cymbalta. Now I am only left with the choice to see a psychiatrist to use me as a lab rat to test different drugs as no doctor ever knows exactly how you will react to a certain drug and the side effects you may have. Please don't let what I have written freak you out I just believe that knowledge is power and hope that maybe I could help someone. Thanks, good luck and never stop trying to love yourself.

Moved around like an 80 yr old! Foot pain was the worst but I had it pretty much all over all muscles and joints. Even though I did yoga and tryed other meds for the pain they made me too dopey. After Diagnosis, 1st Savella helped alot, but seemed to be working less and less after 3rd week titration.  Insurance wouldnt cover it, so I started cymbalta instead.  It only took a week to get through the hot spells and a little dizzyness, started 1 30mg aday now on 2 aday.That is the right dose for Fibromyalgia, No More than that! It started working right away.  I am about 70% better most days, and if you were as bad as I was, you would not be worried about possible withdrawal from a new med, or some side effects!  Anything that helps me get my life back closer to what I had before is worth a try!  I was in chronic pain for 18mo. no end in sight, getting very depressed, disabled from the chronic pain and stiffness, neck and headaches.  Now I am enjoying life again, not 100%, but thank God there is something for people to try for Fibro.now! This med might help you too like it did me. Remember that some people are on too many Rx's at the same time and then add another. It's not an accurate review unless they disclose all Rx's they are on and how much. Or they could be mis-diagnosed.  when you read the scary reviews remember that.  I'm glad I didn't let it scare me.  Good luck!

The first year was great and all my depression symptoms went away. However I have noticed a few negative side affects...prior to taking cymbalta I never had anxiety now I get it quite often and have had many anxiety/panic attacks. My over all health has gone down in last few years...about 30 pounds of weight gain, high blood pressure, and severe migrane attacks (never had those prior either), and more recently hypothyroidism. Not positive these things are related to the cymbalta use but deffintly the aniexty and migranes. The absolute worst part of cymbalta is attempting to wean off of it. I have made a few attempts, this last time I gradually wean down over a period of 4 months. I got all the way down to only 20mg every other day, but the withdrawls were unbearable! Yes, physically painful in muscle's and joint's as well as terrible migranes and vertigo, mood swings, and anxiety. I feel like I'm a prisoner to cymbalta, I hate it...and regret the day I agreed with my doctor to begin use. Before beginning cymbalta do research on the side effects and withdrawl symptoms of going off...I wish I did! My doctor now tells me it is one of the hardest anti-depressants to quit.

I will report back after I can tell if this has helped at all. I am still nervous about the ringing/hissing in the ears, as that may be a sign of high blood pressure, something that I read in these reviews is caused by Cymbalta.

Another prescription (cannot remember the name ) was so upsetting...I could not swallow without rubbing my throat - even just saliva, I could not walk, I couldn't talk, and my body was in constant restlessness. Like restless leg syndrone. I just take it one day at a time and refuse to take anymore meds. When i took abilify I was not capable of driving until my body got use to it.

It was extremely helpful, but just recently it started to lose its effectiveness. I am on 60 mg once a day.  My doc added 2.5 mg of Abilify and I am better now than I have been in 20 years. I have been on Cymbalta so long I'm not sure I know what the side effects are.  My advice is give it a chance to work before you give it up.

I have been on it for about 17 days now and I feel better mentally (meaning I seem to ""care"" more about things: showering, cleaning, exercising, etc) but I have been feeling poor physically. Since I started the Cymbalta I have been experiencing moderate to severe stomach upset - including gas pains, loose stools, frequent movements, painful movements, etc. I also have been experiencing nausea and dizziness. For example, I will be driving down the road and all of a sudden a wave of dizziness will overcome me where I feel the road is slanting or I feel like I am going to pass out behind the wheel. It is very scary and quite unnerving. I also have been experiencing ""shots"" of pain in odd places throughout my body. My wrist, or calf, or most recently behind my left eye. These ""shots"" of pain only last 30 to 40 seconds but are severe enough to make me wince and cringe until they are over. I also have been finding it more difficult to sleep at night, and nearly impossible to stay asleep during the night. I might ask my psychiatrist for a sleep aide to remedy this situation, as nearly all OTC sleep medicines I have used do not help for long periods of time. I also don't like capsule beads. A few positives: I feel my sex drive is back 110% - I want it all the time, multiple times a day. I can not seem to get enough. This is a welcomed side effect from my boyfriend, after a LONG dry spell under Lexapro. I am also finding my appetite to be smaller, sometimes I have to force myself to eat (though that is very rare). I also find myself having much less lower back aches and pains. I am concerned about all I am reading regarding negative side effects and withdrawals. I will have to discuss this further with my psychiatrist. I also feel I may need an anti anxiety medication to get me through those times when a single anti-depressant doesn't cut it. I hope to report back when I have been on this dosage a little longer."

MOST IMPORTANT: FOr those patients who want to get off this horrible drug,look in Yellow pages of phone book, under Phaarmacies, and look carefully for a COMPOUNDING SPECIALIST..Consult your Dr. first and tell Dr.about this specialist..The SHOULD be able to get you capsules of beads. ex: 10 beads = 1mg, and reduce by 1mg for 3 or 5 or 10 days, then 2mg, for 3,5, 10 days, etc. HOPE this is helpful.

(94-101) No a/c in house except bedrooms. I was in kitchen. Had to see Sodium Dr. (nephrology-kidney) AND he told me that side effect of Cymbalta is LOW SODIUM levels!!!! Great! Can't get off cymbalta cause it is the only thing keeping my severe ANXIEY down. 30mg doen't help w/ depression. can't take 40mg, side/effects. NOW I am restricted to 4 CUPS of any FLUIDS a day...Mt life is just getting worse and worse. Stuck in debiltating depression and still get major anxiety attacts in morning and take 2mg Ativan. ANd smoke cigarets and drink lots of coffee when anxiety attacks happen. Had 1 cup coffee & 1 cup water am. Now can only have 2 more cups of water today and thats it. EVERTinG was fine when I was on ZOLOFT 2007, 08, 09. THEN DR. bullied me into taking PROZAC cause I said I was ""kinda"" depressed. INtrrupted me before I could tell her I can't take Prozac. Took before and 1 pill made my head go crazy. Dr. ambushed so badly I coudn't think straight.Stupidly took it. Head went crazy on 15mg.told to lower it to 10mg and ANXIETY came back big time. No anxiety on Zoloft. Back to ZOLOFT and it gave me anxiety & killer headaches. Weaned off and hit w/ severe anxiety. Prescribed 5-6mg Ativan/day. Anxiety would not calm down after 5 months. SO last resort was Cymbalta. 30mg finally greatly reduced Anxiety, but still had to take ativan. Can;t get off Cymbalta cause of the anxiety. NOW got side-effect of Cymbalta which Low Sodium that sodium Dr. told me about. So thirsty. I want to commit suiside, but no garage for car.Afraid that my Ativan + klonopin will only cause me to overdose and end up in psych ward. Last place I want to be!!!!! New Srink wanted to to try ENMAM patch. FInd out can;t take Ensam of on any ssi or ssni. SHRINK would have killed me!!!!! NOW you know why I want to kill myself..AND Prozac gave me Permanent Anxiety!!!!"

If you do that on Cymbalta, you have to lie on the floor while the room spins.

If you're ever out of state (like going away to college), it's not covered by insurance companies (psych meds are not transferable out of the state they are prescribed in), and it costs $200/month.

I took it for 6 months and the Dr wanted to switch me to Pristique, to see if it had less side effects. It was like taking nothing. So He prescribed Lyrica. My blood tests started to show elevated renal effects. Also I was gaining weight, and it wasn't as effective as Cymbalta. The only side effect I feel is muscle twitching, and sometimes the relief just isn't as good as it was at first. Sometimes I just have to take Tylenol to supplement the pain to go to tap class.

It was no better than any of the SSRIs I had tried, but the side effects are far worse.  I had terrible headaches, dizziness, increased anger and aggression.  I now have extremely stiff joints, combined with muscle aches, which I attribute to the cymbalta because they were acute and did not develop gradually.

Now i have no more 'crying fits' due to my depression. If you can get past 2 weeks this drug just may be for you. 

Please don't miss more than a couple dosages. Your symptoms will start to come back . I forgot to take for 3 days and I become very lightheaded every time i stood up.

I would tell anyone even thinking about CYMbalta not to take it. Depression is much easier to handle than the withdrawals you go through to get off this med.  I may even lose my job from this as I can not perform my duties.  I am 56 years old and new jobs are hard to find.  I hope I make it through this withdrawal with no permanent effects!

I never realized how much it had helped with back pain, which is not why I was taking it.  It's not a great alternative to all the options out there.  But, it's important to remember that medications work differently on each of us.  Do as much research as possible, before you make the decision, and let discuss it with your doctor and why you want whatever medication you choose, if you're doctor is a good doctor they will listen and help you, if they don't find another doctor.  There is hope for all of us, we just may have to take different meds to get there.  Good luck, everyone.

I do have some side effects, like sleepiness, loss of appetite, I also clench my teeth, and cold sweating. I just started taking the pills before bed, and that has helped a lot. It also took care of the pain I feel with some nerve damage I have. You really cannot drink alcohol with this. I had a couple of drinks one night, and became extremely sick. Even with the side effects, I would still take this medication. It has worked better than all the other pills I have tried. I feel so much more like myself.

Thought this would be better since it also had the extra effect of helping neuropathic pain, which I have.  I already take Neurontin for that. And Ultram.  Not long after starting this, I became so ill, dizzy, nauseous.  I couldn't move my head from a pillow.  Slowly weaned myself off and back on Wellbutrin.  Soooo glad I wasn't on longer than a month and didn't have to go through the withdrawals these people went through.  Just shows how everyone needs to be their own advocate and investigate what they are being given, because most doctors won't tell you what could happen. Or they don't know because they haven't looked into it, just had a salesman give them samples....

Finding a hobby (yard work or something physical- releases something, sleeping more, and watching my diet helped alot more.  I felt weak taking a pill to solve my problems. While taking it, I had a constant low grade headache, It did nothing for depression, made me aggressive and easily agitated.  Other benefits included easier breathing, less joint and back pain, easily controlled with aspirin.  I did start to sweat more than usual, urination was less too. I have an active job so weight gain was not an issue.  My doctor provided me with samples, I guess the prescription is expensive, so I am looking into the B vitamins and niacin to relieve some of the depression, for anxiety a little caffiene pill or coffee at the start of the day helps, for sleep depending on how much is needed, Melatonin helps- be careful or you'll end up with a caffiene withdrawl and melatonin can give you a zombie feel too, like cymbalta. As for the action in the bedroom, it's better for the female, stay erect, with delayed climax for men, all the time in the world for women.  I tried Lexapro and Paxil- could not multitask, made me feel worse, I love to multitask, driving became a joke If you can't multitask you cannot drive- try it. I've been off if two weeks, I feel like the film of a hard boiled egg is peeling away exposing reality-  Headaches remain with slight vertigo. I look forward to changing my sleep patterns to get enough REM sleep so I can dream again, for now the new dreams are extreme, but interesting, if you can't dream, what fun is sleeping? Try reading ""Healing yourself Naturally"" by Michael Savage- using everyday foods that we no longer cook or eat (more healthy) most of our poor diets and low phisical activity are the main reasons we have this epidemic of depression and anxiety. Shift work and light sensory deficits are another.  I think i just  cured myself.  Good luck, prayer helps too."

I have been on just about all antidepression medicines you can think of over the last 10 years and none of them work for long. I am now on cymbalta at highest does 120mg a day. It seemed to work well for a month or so but now I am back to being depressed alot. I am beginning to think nothing will work. With the cymbalta 120, i also take klonopin 1mg 4x's a day and concerta 36mg once a day. Some days I function and some days i dont get out of bed, shower, clean my house or anything. I wish they would find the right medication mix for me already. Have not really had any side affects from the cymbalta, I take it at night so it wont make me tired during the day no change in appetite(which is great because they had me on 600mg of seroquel xr and I gainded 40lbs in 2 months I told them I refused to take it anylonger) the only side affect of this medicine is that I have absolutely no sex drive at ALL, could be the medicine but could also be the depression.
1694$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$5/23/2011 12:36:37 PM$Reviewer: dt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$"I was on Wellbutrin for a long time, then nothing for 6 mos., then doc put me on Cymbalta. Very interesting. Helps me to control the bad feelings and not go into downward spirals like before. Brain does feel ""foggy"" but it's not bad so far-- more like I'm very thoughtful and introspective when at rest. Instead of spending time doing escapist stuff like websurfing and playing games, I sometimes just sit and think about my life and what I could do to improve it. Seems like a healthy change. Appetite has decreased and I have less of a desire for junk food, in fact I've gotten addicted to muesli of all things. Takes longer to reach orgasm, especially compared to being on Wellbutrin, but when it does hit-- OH my GOD ;) I would have to have six in a row of those little firecracker Wellbutrin orgasms to reach the same intensity of my first one on this drug! So, not a bad trade-off. Sleeping DEEPLY for the first time in years. All in all, it's a good experience so far and I'm hopeful about the future."

I actually wanted to do get out of the house and had energy to do so. My doctor had me decide if I wanted to try the 60mg option after a week on 30mg. I thought it would make me feel even better so I gave it a try. Same side effects the first 3 days, the I had worse depression than before starting Cymbalta. Went back to the 30mg and things couldn't be better. There is a decreased sex drive effect and the occasional inability to reach orgasm, but it seems to be improving the longer I have been on the medication.

It eased the pain for about 1 week. On week 2, I found myself needing to nap in the early afternoon,anywhere from 4-6 hrs. I continued to take this medicine as it was part of my treatment. The dosage was increased to 60mg but the pain and sleepiness and weight gain remained. I slowly weaned myself off the drug. I experienced brain zaps, headaches, and just felt crappy all of the time. My main reason for posting any comments is that this drug interfered enough with my vision that I've had to have my prescription adjusted 3 times. If you are reading this post, I encourage you to explore all of your options before taking Cymbalta.

I can enjoy things more and don't cry all the time. I used to feel physically sick from depression and was really sensitive to fluctuations of my blood sugar level but the Cymbalta has virtually eliminated those symptoms.  It has also helped alleviate anxiety and calmed racing thoughts.  I've definitely experienced decreased interest in sex and it is harder to reach orgasm and the orgasms are not as good, but it's worth it to not feel like killing myself.  Also, after about 3 months of being on it, my sex drive seems to be gradually increasing again and I can reach orgasm a little more quickly than when I first started the medication.  I also noticed an almost immediate increase in appetite which is annoying but I've been able to deal with it pretty well so far.

I have had a few headaches and a strange ""shock"" in my leg (the inside of my knee), in the same place everytime.  I did miss two days at one time and felt very bad. I was dizzy and felt tingly in my face. All stopped when I returned home and took my forgotten medicine.  I when I was taking the 30mg daily, that it worked better for me. That could have just been because I was starting to feel better though.  I haven't had any sexual side effects, no abnormal sweating, or anger issues with this drug. I am concentrating more and i work better. I do have aches and pains from the depression that seem to be easing. I will continue to report progress.  [email protected]"

Took 30mg for a week, during which time I was nauseous, dizzy, and suffered some of the worst headaches of my life.  Increased to 60mg after that, and began to feel better mentally.  I actually could get through a day at work without bursting into tears for no reason, and I started feeling moments of happiness again.  The side effects during this time however were quite irritating.  I began to bite the inside of my mouth during sleep, and sometimes when awake and not even when eating! I ended up with painful mouth ulcers from repeated biting, and this lasted about a month after switching to the 60mg. I then began experiencing insomnia at night, and bouts of nearly narcoleptic drowsiness at work, along with shortness of breath and vertigo.  Then I got on the scale and realized with horror that I had gained 20 pounds!!! I had already gained 15 pounds in the 8 months prior to taking the medication.  I am willing to accept responsibility for THOSE pounds, because I sat home and ate like a pig for weeks after the suicide of my sister.  I was NOT prepared to gain 20 pounds in 3 months while working and eating healthfully.  The shock of being a 5'4"" female who now weighs close to 175 pounds was enough to send me into a three week drinking binge. So much for the few months of feeling slightly better.  I am now debating on whether or not to quit taking this medication, as some reviewers have suggested that it may cause further weight gain.  I am not prepared to deal with that, and I really wish they would list weight gain as a side effect on the patient info! I would NEVER have agreed to take this medication if I had known it were a possibility.  In summary, the damage that this medication has caused to my self esteem and my sex life are likely irreversible and I was probably less depressed before Cymbalta than I am right now."

After 2 weeks of tremors and other unpleasant side effects, the drug began to help. It stabilized my mood, feelings of sadness and anxiety. A great side effect I didn't expect: after 2 months, I noticed that the extreme nerve pain in my neck stopped. I had herniated discs and bone spurs that now cause no pain. The biggest downfall to the medication has been bruxism. I started clinching my teeth at night shortly after I started taking the medication and have had to have one tooth removed and three crowns as a result of cracking my teeth. It also causes headaches and muscle pain in my shoulders. I've tried every device known to doctors to stop the bruxism, but it continues. If not for that - and it is awful, I would call it a wonder drug.

So I am still in debilitating depression..New Dr. had me drop to 20mg and got overly, super stressed..Now, I have to go back to 30mg Cymbalta..Side effects: muscle twitching between my thumb and first finger, (2) body gets hot, like a hot flash that last for hours.. I hate this drug..Now he has me on 500mg Depakote, 1mg Klonipin, 5mg Ambien(Cymbalta caused wrestless sleep, then insomnia...Plus in am, 125mg Depakote, 50mg Lamictal ev other day..Zoloft was only antidepressant I could take, till original Dr. bullied me into Prozac..I knew I coud not take Prozac. Dr. refused to listen to me..Since May 2010, I became debilitatd..can't drive, shower, wash face, brush teeth. Live in pajamas 24/7..Prisoner in my house due to debilitating major depression disorder. Celexa, headaches, Lexapro, anxiety, Paxil, over stimulated me on 5mg & woke me up at 4am..I am NOT bipolar..I hate my original Dr. for forcing me into Prozac, then Zoloft gave me side-effects: anxiety nixed by Ativan, but kiler headaches startd & would not stop.

I took 30mg for 3 days. It was the worst 3 days of my life.

Well, I should say, did work. The first 6 months on 90 mg, I felt great. Now, after about a year, some symptoms are getting stronger again. I will have to review with the Dr.
The only bad thing I can say about it is the missed-dose side effect: If I forget one dose, I get very dizzy the next day. It's very disturbing, but can be prevented if I take one capsule in the morning (usual dose is 3 capsules at night).
I have other aches and pains that Cymbalta doesn't affect at all, so I was surprised to learn here that it is used for arthritis/fibro pain.
I don't know if it's worth it if you don't have insurance, for me it was worth a try. Maybe I'll be put on a higher dose."

If I missed a dose, I would have HORRIFIC vertigo. I did not feel like myself, and honestly I am not sure how I functioned at work feeling that way, perhaps I didnt function well. I stopped taking the medication in 2008, due to losing my health insurance and I could not afford $130 dollars for the medication. I quit cold turkey. DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY. It was the WORST decision I could have EVER made. It was the most horrific withdrawl I could imagine. The withdrawl lasted about 2 months, and at that point I was only taking 20 mg. I had vertigo, irritation, agitation, headaches, did not want to be around anyone... I would go home from work and go to bed at 6PM and not get up until the following day.

Not only is this life-threatening (all over the Cymbalta label, it says DO NOT TAKE WITH SSRI MEDICATION), he responded to my worsening condition by doubling my dose to twice the therapeutic level (120 mg/day- I refused). He'd already done the same with my Adderrall, which he's been using as a supplement to SSRI/SNRI medication to treat ""resistant symptoms."" I am prescribed 60 mg/day Adderrall; the therapeutic dose is 40. Additionally, he doubled my Klonipin, which was initially .5 mg/AM, .5 mg/noon, and 1 mg/bedtime. Now I'm on a total of 4 mg/day- again 2x the therapeutic dose. 

About 2 mos. into Cymbalta (1 mo. at 60 mg), I began to feel that something was very wrong. I am a therapist myself, so it took a LOT to call my psychiatrist's cell phone at 10PM 3 nights ago. He stated that he would follow up in the AM & probably call in a Lexapro prescription, because I was probably having withdrawal symptoms (you think? I've been on it for as long as I can remember and he tried to wean me in 4 weeks!)...and he only said this AFTER I suggested it. I also re-read ALL my prescription labels & learned that NONE of my medications should be taken all at once. I take Omeprazole for GERD, which is NOT supposed to be taken with Adderrall, as it prevents absorption in the gut. Cymbalta is not to be taken with antacids OR SSRIs (Lexapro), or Klonopin, or by people who smoke (I smoke), as nicotine depletes it in the bloodstream. Also, I cannot eat; I have no appetite, and have lost 20 lbs. since starting with this dr. in September...probably due to the unnecessarily high dose of Adderrall and the fact that a side effect of Cymbalta is appetite loss. I consume probably 600 calories a day, all liquids. I don't even notice until nighttime. I'm a 5'10"" female & wasn't overweight to start; now I just look sick.

It's been 3 days and my psychiatrist has not called me back. Unbelievable."

I am not bipolar. Inpatient psychiatric care is a total crock. As long as you make your bed, go to group, go to meals they completely let you alone and NO ONE DOES ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM.The Psychiatrist sees you once or twice a week and says ""You have side effect from drug?

I also had Traumatic Brain Injury that that effected my speech and short term memory.  Was initially being treated by an othropidic spinal doctor who prescribed pain killers and physical therapy. Overtime, pain was overwhelming  and I became depressed regarding my mental and speech problems.  Went to see a nuerologist who put me on Cymbalta and I can only say that my outlook on life is amazing. I was also put in a cognitive therapy program and while I am still challenged with the memory and speech issues, my attitude about my situation is very positive.  I started with 60mg but increased to 120mg.  Sleep can be an issue at times but I truely beleive that without the Cymbalta, my situation would and was just about unbearable. I am able to tackle my problems (as well as ususal daily challenges) in a positive manner with minimal pain. The pain I am experiencing is localized to trauma area instead of being exhasterbated by stress and aneixty of my situation. I do hope to be off this drug in the future, but in the meantime, it has given me the ability to mentally and emotionally deal with my situation.

I am also taking Welbutrin but it was not enough for me on it's own. The only downside to these meds is when you run out. The withdrawals are awfull and I even had involuntary twitching in my head and neck. As soon as I got my meds again, I was fine. Also, it's a shame that it is so expensive when it's one of the most popular depression medications and we depend on it.

While it has helped with the depression the side affects are horrendous!  This is what your doctor won't tell you (or at least what mine didn't tell me)...I felt like a walking zombie 90% of the time. I could not get enough sleep no matter how much I slept.  I had no emotions. I had no sex drive AT ALL. I had strange, vivid dreams. I had significant weight gain even though my dr insisted the medicine didn't cause weight gain.  I had a very FLAT feeling all the time...just numb all over.  

After weaning myself off the drug and finally quitting it completely I still have BAD withdrawal symptoms.  It has been almost a month since I have taken a full dose. Since then, I have had lose stools, shortness of breath, high blood pressure, ringing in the ears, weird sensations in my brain..like electrical ""zaps"", extreme dizziness, headaches, cannot concentrate, memory loss, nausea and just generally feel bad all over, like I have the flu. I am hoping all these feelings and symptoms go away soon.  I pray there is no permanent damage. 

Please consider all the side affects before starting this med!"

This is a life saver!!!  :)   I tried others but this one was the best - once it was completely in my system/I was past the point of my body & mind adjusting to it, which takes a good couple of months at least so give it a real chance to help.  I have gone off of it a few times, thinking I was better, only to realize each time how much it was truly helping me deal with the emotional & physical circumstances in my life - I have been through a series of huge life adjustments all at once.  I was married (1st time), instant step children, moved from CA to WA, new job, etc. So it felt like I had not only lost my entire family, church family, & friends with the move, but then there were 4 deaths in my family since I moved.  Plus I was dealing with the agony of physical pain & restrictions from doing most anything active because of the pain. Cymbalta really helped with my attitude about dealing/accepting all that was happening and kept me from emotional breakdowns.  It continues to just keep me stable and fairly happy despite my circumtsances!!!  :)   Try it, you'll like it!  May God Bless you. :)    xoxoxoxoxo

I have only been on it for 5 days and it has made me worse with all of the other drugs that I take. I am a c-6/c-7 quad and they have given me the 20mg dose, sense I started taking it I have suffered from more of it than it was supposed to help. My first dose that I took caused my bladder to fill up with over 710milileters with the head of my penis stinging none stop, They would not send me to the E.R. and for the past 6 days that I have taken it, everything that I eat just comes out the other end! I am 6ft 9in and weigh 105.6lbs. and I am in a nursing home to help me gain weight and to get back into my wheelchair. It is very hard to do when everything you eat just keeps going through you and you are afraid to move because of it. I can not gain weight or even work-out because this med has me so far down that I do not even know what to do. It has made me very friendly to even the nurses that I have asked to be sent to the E.R. after my bladder expanded and they still wouldn't. This is a drug that should be taken off of the market and destroyed so no human has to suffer from it. If you have any loved ones in nursing homes that are on this medication PLEASE have them taken off of it so they do not suffer from it. I am only here for 3 months and if this is what it is doing to me only after 5 days, have a Dr. from a different place check them out!

I have attempted Cymbalta trials twice. The first time it moderately helped both my pain and sleep...actually all I could do was sleep. I felt like I was in some kind of bizarre fog of contentment for the first month or so. Went from 30mg once a day to 30 twice a day with a goal dose of 120mg perday. Eventually however I lost the ability to sleep, felt horribly hot all the time and had constipation issues. Also, the med did not work well enough for me to stop the neurontin.  I had no problems reducing my dose. More recently I experienced a severe pain exacerbation and decided to give Cymbalta an other chance (after hating Savella for 2 weeks).  This time we started at 60 mg and I experienced ataxia, nausea, severe tremors, inability to sleep, and chronic over-heating.  I also would wake in the morning feeling like I'd been poked with a cattle prod and would feel an overwhelming sense of impending doom.  It continued to do this even after we backed down to 30mg. If I'd been able to sleep at night and not feel a sense of impending doom in the morning then I MIGHT say it helped my pain.  This time around I lasted only 2-3 mos on it before needing to stop taking it. I don't know why the side effects were different this time.  Oh, and both times I took it my BP shot upwards and stayed higher for the duration.  I think I'll try a tricyclic next. If you must try this med, have them test your liver enzymes first.  Also, discuss carefully ahead of time the types of issues and side-effects that will lead you to stop taking this drug. That way your doctor will be more psychologically prepared."

I also gained quite a bit of weight, but I quit smoking a few months before I started the Cymbalta (I was on Wellbutrin which reaaly didn't do anything for me), so I don't know which one caused the weight gain more.  Also, no sex drive but I didn't reaaly have one before I started taking it because I was depressed!

OMG on med for 2 days(30 mg pill)what a nightmare..I took pill at nite in case it made me tired..tired all I did was sleep I was physically exhausted just to walk up the stairs was a effort after a nap I still felt like I could sleep more which I did. When I was awake all I did was throw up. My kids thought I was seriously dying. I looked awful!! That was the first day the second was the same only I started to feel the effects more on my body. I stopped w/this med and for the next 4 days I have had body aches something awful I am not tired all the time but still not up to my energy level I was at before I now am having trouble sleeping. This is a very expensive med. and the side effects are different for all who have tried it--thanks to our body chemistry. If you are thinking about trying this med. weigh the side effects to your need for this drug.  Myself needing this for nerve damage..I should of held my ground and refused to try this. The road to where I was at 10 days ago is along hard one to get back to.Dr's should try this for afew days themselves and see what the side effects are and the recovery road to get back to normal. Then maybe they wouldn't push this drug on people. All in all this is nothing I will boast about in fact I will tell all DONT TAKE IT!!!!

THIS WAS my last resort anti-D.

Note I have to take 20mg am, 20mg pm w/ 9 hour spread between doses. Total time 3 months since started. IT IS NOT WORKING..THere is NO lifting of depression. feel bad and awful many days. Can't function, shower, brush teeth, drive...trapped in house feeling bad and VERY depressed. Shrink keeps saying now can't help me..Seen 3 other shrinks..no help..ONLY anti-D that worked was Zoloft and DR bulled me into Prozac and all hel let loose and Cymbalta is NOT helping my depression at all. Celexa(headaches) Prozac(made my head go crazy then terribe anxiety. Lexapro(gave me anxiety)Paxil (5mg at night woke me up at 4am..) I just can't be an untreatable, can't live like this. Keep calling for more doctors..its a nightmare. Afraid I am going to die from this med or complications. ZOLOFT no longer worked after taking Proozac!!!

I suffered from major depression, anxiety, as well as constant pain in my neck and shoulders. There was an adjustment period of about a month before the pills sort of leveled out in my system. At first i experienced disorientation, loss of appetite,trouble focusing and an overall loopy feeling but after a month I didn't have those issues.The only long term issues I have had are dry mouth, sweating, and if I forget a dose I have awful nightmares but in comparison to the way I felt before these are all tolerable side effects. An added bonus for me was the pain I was experiencing completely stopped in the first week after starting the meds. I had no idea that the pain I was having was a symptom of my depression/anxiety and had been numerous times to doctors for it with out ever finding out what was the cause or getting any relief. I would say my experience has with cymbalta has been good overall.

I feel like it has really helped. I was feeling so sad and just moving through life because I had to. I felt like bad things were just a part of life and you shouldn't expect to be happy or expect good things to happen just get through it. I have to tell you, that after three weeks I went back to my doctor and cried because for the first time in a long time I had hope. I felt like life was fun again and I  enjoyed waking to a new day. I have had some side effects that are minor. one being that when the doctor recommended that I increase my dose to 60mg I was a bit of a zombie. I just wanted to sleep. I also had a lot of cold sores. I have been on 30 mg the whole year and occasionally have to take benidryl to sleep. I notice that If I miss a dose I seem to get a cold sore. I have wondered what the connection is with that. I will occasionally get dizzy and crave salty items. I sometimes feel more spacey. But I would take it again in a heart beat. I am loving life I am a better mother, wife, friend and person. I can laugh at myself for my humanity(instead of thinking I was such a dork) and I love people. Others seem to like to be around me and I like to be around my self. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I felt origionally felt 'weird', somewhat 'stupid' and dizzy or disorientated.  After the second week, I thought most of odd effects had calmed. I drove over 100 miles to visit with life-long freinds (no driving difficulities) but with in 10 minuites of my arrival, my friends began to condem me for having driven drunk.  They had known me all my life - knew I've never drank - yet I was not able to convince them that I was not drunk/drinking...  In the few years since, I have meet several people that I could tell were on Cymbalta (and found I was correct).  I call it the 'Cymbalta Stare', sort of a glazed, empty look to their face and eyes.  They respond to my offered friendship by asking if I'd like to hear their favorite CD, see a movie, etc... but within minutes they've forgotten they were looking for that CD, or what whatever activity it may have been and polietly say they would like to take a nap or other comment. They tend to invite me to their home, room, (comfort zone), then within minutes are ready to be left alone.  I've also watched friends insolate themseves, display extreme depressive behaviors, and become totally disfunctional while remaining on this med for 2 and 3 years.  The ""Cymbalta Stare"" should be a big signial that this drug is not right for those individuals."

What do you mean by satisfaction? You can be satisfied during the time of using it, but what happens when you try to withdraw from this medication? You can check online on a few forums talking about this med. It sucks. Try to stop it and things will go upside down. DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY on this pill. Some common withdrawal effects are, on my experience, but not limited to: panics, crying, severe feeling of depression, stomachache, ear buzz, terrible pains allover your body.

Called Doctors office told to stop taking it and if symptoms get worse go to the ER. I'm afraid to go to the ER and have them give me something else to make me feel better, afraid it make it worse. My pain level has gone up, since I took this medicine. Someone need to do something about this drug before it hurts or kills someone."

The first day I took the 30 mg, I felt so much better.  It did give insomnia though.  I was told that would go away after taking it a while.

Not only has my weight been hard to manage, I have not slept at all , had horrible muscle problems, my blood pressure has sky rocketed, but worst of all I have had some anger and irritability that scares me. When I decided I had enough I told my doc I was going off it. He advised me to wean off for the last 3 months. Every month I went down  30 mg, until today i am on none. The withdrawals have been HELL- I do not say that lightly. I know this stuff is poison, i have had the most vivid scary nightmares a person  could have. I also have had some rage that freaks me out.

I take low dose of dexedrine for Sympathetic Hyperalgesia-Edema Syndrome. About a week or so after starting Cymbalta for Fibromyalgia, I developed headaches in the occipital area that pain meds did not even help.  Previously my endocrinologist who performed many case studies of women with only a partial pituitary gland who also had these nagging occipital headaches.  The Dexedrine basically relieved this when even opiate pain meds did not. Another MD prescribed Cymbalta for my worsening fibromyalgia (I had terrible side effects with Savella and Lyrica previously) which started to help somewhat except I began getting these occipital headaches back.  After my last visit with my endocrinologist, he told me to wean off the Cymbalta because it took away the effectiveness of the Dexedrine for the Sympathetic Hyperalgesia-Edema Syndrome.  I just finished the 3-weeek weaning off of Cymbalta and the occipital headaches are finally dissipating but my sensitity with the fibromyalgia is again increasing.

I believe that cymbalta should be taken off the market and the companies that make this drug should be held accountable for the devastating side effects of this drug.The pharmacy reps push this drug on the doctors, in turn they give it to their patients, I never bought one bottle of medication, it came out of my doctors drug closet.

I am taking for 2 reasons DEPRESSION and NERVE PAIN, works WONDERS ON the pain.
But made me nervous and 'weird' and wired on 30mg.  I cut back to 15mg and can manage.  May have caused Major pain in stomach, had to go to E.R. 2x in one month since beginning.  So that might be the cause, the verdict isn't in on that one.

Excellent on my severe back pain. 
This is a powerful drug so you must watch your mental state while on it, and cut back if you feel like 'not you.' others have said what I experience on higher doses, not like 'myself.' and that's not good.

You have to be VERY careful coming off of it, no stopping cold turkey. And you can get some horrible symptoms coming off of it, or going on it. My mom couldn't take it, she has FM as well. She couldn't stand the dizzies and the electric-shocky feeling in her head. She got those when starting it, I only get them when I run out.
 I know not everyone has as good an effect from it, but it's worth trying. It has completely changed my life for the better."

I am on my third glass of Merlot to control the symptoms. I am keeping a blog on myspace.com. Look me up and give me a shout out...my name is Tracy Sanders on myspace.com. I have never written a blog before, but this drug deserves one. I reviewed Cymbalta back in Dec. 2008 and it was my lifesaver, for a while. I do not think that I have fibro, I think it is a side affect of Cymbalta, who knows. I went in for my bloodwork last month and now my liver enzimes are out of whack and my cholesteral is so high that I am on lovastatin, now. Whee! I never had a problem with this. They did a ultrasound on my liver and gallbladder, a bonescan, osteoporosis now... my foot broke. Look me up. I am on myspace...Tracy Sanders. I would like some feedback.

Immediately, I experienced mild hallucinations, which at first were amusing as I realized I was ""seeing things"" not there.
After two days, the hallucinations got much worse and very, very scary. I lost touch with reality -- and replaced it with vivid nightmare images and horrid scenario that scared the crap out of me.

It stopped only after my wife and brother badgered the doctor to stop the cymbalta.

It did very little to help the depressive side of my Bipolar 2. It rapidly increased my weight, which no other medicine had ever done. I retained water, was constantly bloated and still miserably depressed.

But the worst part, which the Drug Companies never fully explain are the withdrawal symptoms.  Even while withdrawing slowly off this drug it took me 4 months to fully recover.  I became a manic, psychotic, depressed, non-functioning person.  Many people can never get off this drug. The risks far outweigh the benefits. Although there are some people who don't suffer from the withdrawal effect - it is not worth the risk....Try to avoid this drug for depression and particularly for pain. They are better drugs out there. I can't believe that the FDA certified it for certain types of pain. Its a truly terrible drug and the Drug Company that produces it knows it."

I had a 4th back surgery and continued chronic pain with that and fight fatique (MS related) with metadate and the cymbalta really helped boost the metadate.  But, the doc didn't mention any side effects, esp. that of weight gain, which is a BIG issue with me due to the back surgeries. I just can't carry extra weight. I gained 25 pounds in a very short amount of time and have fought tooth and nail to loose it.  Lost 1, gained 2. I feel like I'm in someone else's body. SO uncomfortable all the time on top of the discomfort and aches and pains I deal with all day and night. I saw the doctor again and talked at length about this weight and she never mentioned the cymbalta as a cause. But she did pop out her own weight plan and food journal.  Chalked the wt. gain up to a different drug I'm taking from a different doc.  I am SO p.o'd!!  Will be starting topamax tomorrow for migraines; my cymbalta has been decreased by a third; will also restart wellbutrin and looking forward to the side effect of weight loss from the topomax! I thought it was just me, but after reading so many other people's same issue, I'm glad to know but so disappointed (again) by the medical society.

Citalopram/Celexa knocked out my anxiety, but didn't touch the depression; Wellbutrin worked for great awhile then quit; and this one made things worse. I tried it for 3.5 weeks before telling my dr. I couldn't take anymore and to please put me back on Wellbutrin, but this time I'm going up to the max dose instead of giving up at 300 mg. With Cymbalta, I have had such a hard time even getting out of bed and getting dressed in the morning. Can't concentrate in class. Most disturbingly, I've had sharp, deep pains in my arms and legs (never had this happen before.)

There were times I could not get out of bed because of the pain. I tried several different medications without any help at all. I was not only in pain, I was getting very, very, depressed. I read on here about Cymbalta helping the pain of Fibromyalgia so at my next doctors appointment I asked my doctor if I could change my medication, from Effexor XR to Cymbalta. She changed my script and I could tell a WORLD of difference within the first week! At first I was afraid to believe that it was working, so I didn't say anything to anyone. After about 3 weeks of NO pain I began to really believe it WAS the medication helping. I am so very thankful I decided to take that step and try it. I have not had any side effects at all either, other then my appetite is decreased, which is a good thing! I have my life back!

2010$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$10/14/2010 10:38:56 AM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$"I am 60 yrs old and generally fit, well and healthy although I have suffered from depression for most of my adult life. I was prescribed Cynbalta approx 7/8 wks ago. It initially left me in a more calm state but I suddenly began to take most of the side effects of this drug i.e., nausea, trembling, panic attacks etc. I would urge anyone who is prescribed this drug to carefully look at the side effects because if you are prone to any of them, then you are more than likely to develop some or most of them. My doctor actually advised me not to read the side effects which in retrospect was the wrong advice. I would advise anyone to read the side effects of any prescription drug. I am weaning myself off Cymbalta at the moment but still suffering from its effects - however, I am pleased with my decision to come off it. I shall deal with my depression in my own way now, probably through herbal remedies. I read one review which said ""this is the drug from hell"". I don't believe I would be so graphic but the person making the comment had been on this for several months and I truly wish her well in her recovery. One piece of advise I would offer to anyone is that if you have a decent and understanding partner then you can talk things through with their help. That's what I'm grateful for and I  will not go back on anti depressants. It's too easy for doctors to dole out this medication to an unsuspecting and trustworthy public domain. I hope my review has been a help to you."

My doctor thought that maybe these were a side affect of the Cymbalta. Instead of switching to a different antidepressant I decided to attempt to get off it.  My Doctor started me on a step down process of removing me from Cymbalta.

IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!  I followed his instructions to a T.  Slowly weening myself off.  As the days went on things got worse and worse. I was so dizzy I couldn't get off the couch, I began to have thoughts of suicide. I was so screwed up in the head. All I wanted was for everything to just go away.

I took a whole bottle of Xanax. I wanted to just go away. I wanted to leave my life. I thought that my family would be better off without me.  

My son and husband found me passed out on the floor and called an ambulance. I spent two weeks in the hospital. I worked with doctors to change my drugs, and I am now happy, healthy, and have a wonderful life.

My doctor stated to me after everything was fixed ""We were poisoning you with that drug"". 

I COMPLETELY agree with him. I am soo thankful to my Lord that he didn't take me home that day. 

Every time I hear someone mention this drug I cringe.  Yes it helped me for a year, but the process of trying to get off of it, almost killed me. 

I encourage anyone who is talking with their doctor about taking Cymbalta, to really look at things, look for alternatives, know FOR SURE that this is the medication for you.  Because it sure wasn't for me.

I was started on 30mg daily and increased to 60mg daily and immediately noticed a reduction in pain and increased energy.  Within in a couple of weeks I was shocked to find myself sleeping real sleep and having normal dreams for the first time in many years. My post traumatic stress syndrome, which I suffered from 24/7 was GONE!  I also have not had a panic attack since I have been on it.  As to side effects, I can't be sure.  I have sweats and have gained weight (which I have not been able to lose no matter what I do) but I am post menopausal, hich could also be the cause.  If these are side effects of Cymbalta it IS worth it.  I was so miserable before this treatment and nothing else even touched the fibromyalgia pain let alone the bonus of no more PTSD or panic attacks.

2060$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/6/2010 10:03:04 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$4$5$I started this med to help with menapause depression.  Been on 30mg for about 6 weeks and decided to stop.  The vivid dreams are intollerable.  Feel like I live all night instead of rest.  After reading reviews online about getting off these meds after a long period of time, I decided not to have to go through that as it seems these meds make you more dependent on them.  It does help my depression, but my short term memory went good bye!!  I have recently lost 125 lbs and gained weight already as well as my sugar cravings are at a peak and I am diabetic so that is a no no for me.  I will have to self battle the depression with attitude versus these drugs out there for it.  Maybe even get on valume if need be for aniexty when needed.  I can see this medication helping for severe depression, but I cannot see the benefits for menapause induced depression.  I am only 41 and had to have an emergency hysterctomy 2 years ago.  I have balanced my depletion of hormones with quarterly bloodwork and vitamins with no artifical hormones as the history in my family with breast lumps.  Cymbalta is a good med, just not for me.  Before you start any type of the med, I would be leary of its' dependency on it as you cannot stop cold turkey.  I have after 6 weeks and I am sure I will feel it in the next few days.

At first I didn't hav any side effects.  About a month into treatment I began to experience severe reflux to the point where I was coughing and my throat was burning. This continued despite the fact that I was taking 40 mg Omeprozole, 2 Zantac and assorted Pepcid and Tums throughout the day.  Finally after 5 months I had to stop taking it. That is another story!  I had tried to stop taking it once before but had dizzy spells.  My doctor told me to take 30 mg for 2 weeks then stop.  After 1 1/2 days the dizzy spells began again. Yesterday marked 2 weeks off of Cymbalta, and two weeks on Meclizine.  I had to take another drug to stop (or should I say make more bearable) the dizzy spells.  At one point I couldn't move my head, only my eyes to stop the spinning.  The benefits did not outweigh the side effects for me but they may for you since everyone tolerates medication differently.

Hi there.
Over the past 10 years, I have taken: Prozac, Paxil (yikes!), Celexa, Lexapro, Zoloft, Effexor XR, Serzone, Trazodone, Elavil, and Pamelor.  In most cases, either the side effects were intolerable or there was something ""missing."" When I began treatment with Cymbalta, something clicked - and it felt wonderful.  Over the past couple of years, I've been on/off it due to insurance b.s.  A little over two months ago, I resumed taking Cymbalta 60mg/day.  My depression began to lift within two-three weeks, then after a month, my fibromyalgia symptoms decreased and my chronic back pain is GONE.
The only side effects I've noticed are: very mild decrease in libido (hence only 4/5 stars on ease of use), a bit of sweating, and occasionally a tad of urinary hesitation.  I'm guessing that Cymbalta has just the right balance of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. (unlike most other SNRIs)
Though it can be a bit pricey depending on your insurance, I believe it is well worth it. Honestly, I would recommend this medication to anyone- especially to those who have not responded to SSRIs and also those who suffer from the double-whammy of depression and a chronic pain syndrome.
Best of luck!"

I lost my short-term memory, had severely stiff muscles and cramping, increased depression, intolerable insomnia, sugar cravings like you wouldn't believe (with related weight gain), joint pain, heart palpitations, tinnitus, hypertension, no libido, no motivation to do anything.  They don't give you enough information on side effects.  I didn't know I was having side effects until I found this web site.  I spent a month weaning myself off and felt dramatically better - like I have my life back. I actually started sleeping a little.  After  a month I threw the rest of my pills away and have been having some withdrawal.  It takes a while to get this poison out of your system, I guess.  The joint pain and muscle cramping are worse.  I feel a lot of intense, irrational anger, still have heart palpitations, tinnitus and hypertension.  At least I can sleep.  I made the decision to get off this stuff without consulting my dr. My experience with drs. is that they want to increase the dosage or add another pill to combat side effects rather than support a patient becoming drug free.  If depression becomes a problem in the future, I'll try a more natural approach to treating  it.  Right now, despite the withdrawal symptoms, I feel pretty terrific - better than I have felt in years.

2103$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$8/6/2010 2:19:23 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking Cymbalta for severe anxiety problems. Took about a week to feel the affects of the meds. After that, my mood has been great, no more bouts of severe anxiety, and it actually improved my overall mood in life(maybe I had a little depression too). The side effects are mild, initially(first three days) the side effects were horrible..drowiness, nausea, dissiness, but after that only minor ones...I seem to have either really weird dreams or really vivid ones(no sleepwalking though). No dimished sex drive, actually it has helped my sex drive, it some how allows me to last longer in bed. Now, I have gained about 20lbs on the medication, but with my anxiety I lost alot of weight, so the weight gain was an addded benefit to me, I actually look healthy. Other than that, no other problems to speak of except when I forget to take it, the symptoms tend to come back like when I first started taking it. Hope this review helps....

I've had bouts of depression & anxiety since I was a child so I've tried them all. I even missed a month of school when I was in 5th grade. (i'm 58 yrs. old now). My mother has always been ""anxious & depressed and/or sick"" which makes me wonder if the disorders are a learned response or inherited.  I actually LOST weight (after switching from Zoloft) but as usual, I find it impossible to get out of bed...really have to push myself.  But that's the way I've always been.

At fist, I thought this was a wonderful medicine. But over time, there was such a subtle change in my health. I gained weight and had more body aches, less energy, and muscle tension/aches. As my Doctor increased the dose, the side effects increased but my Doctor was sure my symptoms had nothing to do with Cymbalta. With the increased weight gain came high blood pressure (I am 47). And not long ago, I just was convinced that while the depression seemed under control, I felt like I was dying in every other way. Then I just could no longer financially afford this very expensive medicine, so I went off it. I stepped down the dose very carefully, but the withdrawal symptoms left me feeling horrible. Each morning I had tremendous aches in my feet & hands, then pinches of sharp pain all over & my peripheral vision seemed affected. It felt like my brain was having spasms.  I also had some headaches behind my eyes along with the other withdrawal symptoms. So I just stopped taking it all together. After a few months, I haven't felt this good in YEARS!  I am so glad this toxic drug is out of my system.  I don't feel the physical pain of depression, I have more energy & have begun to lose the weight! I am no longer running to my Doctor with so many complaints I felt I was dying! I would NOT recommend this drug to my worst enemy. Unless you want to slowly and subtly feel like you're dying in the process of handling depression, this drug is horrible. And who wants to gain weight?? Talk about depressing!!!  The withdrawal from Cymbalta is scary, I can't imagine what it was really doing to my brain.

I did a lot of research on it and decided it was worth a try. It took 5 or 6 weeks before I started feeling like myself again, but I'm so glad I picked this drug! Here's my story: after 6 or 7 years on Celexa (which I had a good experience with) something went wrong. I still don't know what it was exactly, but all of a sudden I was exhausted and had zero energy all the time. So I stopped the Celexa and was determined to stay off antidepressants and treat my depression naturally. Things were O.K. for a few months, but eventually my anxiety/panic attacks/depression/suicidal thoughts got so bad I could not sleep, eat, or enjoy anything and I felt ill-at-ease every waking moment. I cried easily and got angry and hostile over the smallest things. It didn't help that I was just out of school, unemployed, and living in a city with 15% unemployment. The only response I got from sending out dozens of resumes/applications was a from a grocery store...which I worked at unhappily for 5 months (the average time of employment for me). On a side note, I am certain I have Borderline Personality Disorder, though I have not been officially diagnosed. Anyway, if I hadn't gone on this drug when I did, I'm not sure what would've happened to me. I'm sure I scared my husband of less than two years with all my drama. For me, this drug was not effective right away; I spent the first couple of weeks on the couch unable to move unless I had to go to work, bed, or the bathroom. Now, three months later I am fully functional again. The only problems I face now are 1) this drug is VERY expensive and 2) I am trying to get pregnant and both my psych dr. and OB/GYN tell me I need to stop taking it before the 3rd trimester if I do get pregnant. I'm not sure what to do yet because I don't want to go through another horrible depressive state again. For now, things are good so I will count that as a blessing.

Major draw back. Also on day 4, major sexual disfunction started. Lower libido, difficulty gaining an erection, and nearly imposible to orgasm.
I guess the benefits outway the cons. Situational depression, so the hope is only 4 months or so to be on it, while I continue therapy."

WEANING SIDE EFFECTS: SEVERE vertigo/nausea, etc. had to wean off in 5mg increments over several days/increment which required special compounding pharmacy as is only made in 30mg and 60mg doses. Got myself to 30mg/day which still eases some of my fibro pain but does not cause the severe painful side effects the 60mg caused. Tried weaning off of the 30mg got down to 20mg but fibro pain returned significantly, so returned to 30mg. Not very satisfied, but better than nothing i guess.

In the beginning I was taking Prozac and Welbutrine and doing pretty well feeling ok. I told him I wanted to quit all mental type medications and then eventually get off all medications he agreed and suggest I start with weaning off prozac and welbutrine so I did. I felt some depression return so he prescribed Cymbalta. My 2 mistakes; First not researching the drug before starting it and trusting a doctor I did not know very well. Now since I am weaning off Cymbalta I am cursed to suffer 90% of all the bad side effects and there was never any benefit for me to take this drug and when I complained to my psychiatrist about it he just doubled the doseage. When my primary care Doctor found out he said that it was a very bad idea to take more then 60mgs. a day I was doing 120 by doctors orders, never again!

My Dr. wanted me to try it again and guess what, my liver enzymes sky rocketed and I felt terrible. I work for Eli Lilly and they know this drug causes liver problems and destroys livers and gallbladders yet they are unwillingly to pull it off the market because it makes more money than money they lose because of the bad drug.

I had heart pain, chest pain, breast pain, lung pain, joint pain, etc. It was so completely generalized & so severe I didn't have any idea it could be the fibro.  Luckily I went to a Rhumatologist who recognized what was happening and he put me on Cymbalta. At first I didn't like it because it made me feel 'flat' emotionally, but it was rapidly decreasing my pain so I thought I could deal with flat emotions. As I adjusted to it, the emotions came back and my only side effect is a dry mouth and sometimes, itching. I have so much more energy because I'm not hurting so badly.  Pain can zap your energy and life.  I feel like I have a life back!

Within 1 week of starting Cymbalta, I was happier and more motivated. I began to get active and interested in doing stuff again. I lost 12 pounds in 2 months on cymbalta bc it cut my appetite and increased my energy. I am very tolerant of nausea and do not experience nausea easily, but this did cause slight nausea and a sense of fullness/disinterest in food altogether. I had to force myself to eat and my mouth was dry. After 6 months I am still on 60mg and have adjusted. I am no longer as disinterested in food and my mouth is not as dry. My hair is suffering a bit. I am already taking 2X RDA of Zinc and Selenium to help with hair loss for Wellbutrin. Dr. told me to up the dosage of Zinc & Selinium. I buy only brands I trust like Whole Foods and Nature's Way (NW). NW is made in Germany, where vitamins and herbs are regulated like the FDA does w/drugs in the US, so that dosages are consistent. My eyelashes got longer within 6 weeks of starting the Zinc & Selenium the first time, but with the introduction of more Wellbutrin and then Cymbalta, I think I need to take another dose every day. Currently I take them with my other pills in the mornign with breakfast. I have only good things to say about Cymbalta, despite the hair breakage. I have been on Lexapro, Effexor, Pamelor, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin. Cymbalta has had the most dramatic effect for relieving my depression (mood improved, irritability relieved, energy increased, motivation increased, anxiety almost gone. No sleep issues, no weight gain.) It's worth a try.

It will help with depression somewhat (as well as any other antidep) BUT the side effects far outweigh benefits.  The only reason I have taken so long is that it's extremely difficult to stop....Some other users ask if fast heartbeat, anxious, is normal with this med...that is actually a withdrawl symptom specific to Cymbalta. Problem is that it is so short acting that if you forget the dose or take it much later than the day before, these syptoms will start immediately.  So users think its a side effect. There are many bad effects when first taking....but when they go away, and your body becomes tolerant then med also slowly stops working....so after the first year you are really just taking med for no reason. Never heard anyone say it actually helps pain...I am transitioning to another med...not easy, but did realise that syptoms I had for so long are now going away, like sleepiness, uncaring, energy loss...and sex is now amazing...so MY advise is...only start this med if: the cost and doctor visits to get right dosage are not an issue, you are militant about taking meds on time, you are not in a relationship or care about sexual side effects, you don't require much energy or concentration throughout the day, and will be able to handle the pain if you ever have to stop taking med.

A year ago I was given Cymbalta for major depression. YIKES! I took 20 mg for 2 weeks; 40 mg for 3 weeks. Started having numbness/tingling in arms, head, legs. Even collapsed at work with major chest pain. Dr. wanted to INCREASE meds! I said, ""NO!"" and about ran out of her office. I've changed doctors since then.

To wean off this drug was a nightmare - missed two days of work and was a zombie. It's taken a year for the numbness to subside, but I still believe I have issues (major weakness) from taking this drug. 

Please read all warning labels for Cymbalta. There are many other choices that are much safer. I, for one, prefer the older drugs that have been time-tested, and proven.

If you do plan to wean off, do so VERY slowly, but persistently. If you're considering this drug, please reconsider!"

2275$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$4/29/2010 9:44:44 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$1$1$"This drug helped me feel happier and more stable for the first few months. Over time as my tolerance for the drug increased, my symptoms increased, and the dosage increased. I would feel better for a few months after an increased dosage. Eventually I was on the highest dosage but my symptoms were still getting worse. I felt like I was getting lower and more hopeless with each passing day. I ended up getting off the medication because of its lack of effectiveness and experienced intense withdrawal symptoms which included the following: migraines, insomnia, fever, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety attacks, and more.  I had a migraine every day for over 3 months after stopping this medication.  After about 4 months without the medication I began feeling better. Now it's been 6 months off the medication and my depression, sleepiness, and mental and physical energy is largely better than it was when I was on the medication.  I'm back to my normal depressed state which isn't great, but on the medication it was much worse. This medication truly made my depression worse and caused me to become suicidal.  I strongly suggest close monitoring of any young adult who takes this medication (as stated under Cymbalta's ""Warning""), and I also suggests tapering off the medication instead of quitting cold turkey.  Good luck everyone.  "

Helped slightly.  However, withdrawal has been extremely difficult; agony is the best word I can use to describe the symptoms.  Although gradually improving, some symptoms remain 9 mos. after discontinuing this drug.  It is my opinion that it is of paramount importance to work with a physician prior to withdrawing from Cymbalta and do it very, very slowly.  I weaned off of Cymbalta for the recommended 6 - 8 weeks, but if I had it to do over again, I would withdraw extremely slowly over the period of at least a year. I found many articles online in my in-depth research of Cymbalta; some refer to extremely slow withdrawal from the drug, and a year or longer is recommended.  I wish I had found those particular articles before I started weaning off of Cymbalta.  Most of all, I wish I had never taken it.

I don't believe everyone has this same experience, but my own research and my treatment by Dr.'s with extensive experience treating patients withdrawing from Cymbalta (rheumatologist, ER physicians, internist, psychologist, etc.) indicate a great many people do have very serious withdrawal from it. This is not the type of withdrawal people experience from an addictive substance, but a possible and devastating disturbance of brain neurotransmitters.  Sickest I've ever been and still struggling.  

Please be careful and research side effects experienced by real people, not just general information pertaining to Cymbalta, before deciding to take it.  While Cymbalta helped the fibro somewhat, the withdrawal was much, much worse than the fibro pain, and that's saying something.

After 6 years of being on 20mg of Lexapro, the drug started to wear off. I was starting to feel on edge, angry, panicky, and downright tired. I was sweating all of the time, nauseated, and it felt like I was having irregular heart beats. I've also had 13 surgeries on my right leg and the pain had started to make me feel like I was insane. So, the doc switched me to Cymbalta. I'm on week 2, day 2 at 60mg and feel slightly better. It addressed some of the pain in my leg, so far. My anxiety is starting to calm down a little bit, so I'm hoping within a few more weeks I will start to feel like me, again. I was nauseated for the 1st 2 days, however it wasn't too bad. I find taking it with a little food or milk helps. Like any drug, it may take a few weeks to fully kick in, so none of the other side effects have consumed me. I still feel a bit shaky and anxious, however I'm only on day 2, week 2 with an increased dose. I am praying this works.. I've been on Prozac, Lexapro, and a form of fluxotene (spelling?) and eventually, those wore off. Hoping Cymbalta will do the trick... So far, it's not that bad...

Cymbalta was prescribed to relieve anxiety. What I found was an immediate relief from irritability that I hadn't been aware I was experiencing. Relief from the irritability is what I like most about Cymbalta. I find that the discontinuation symptoms are comparable to Effexor XR except it takes much less time to experience them. From experience I have learned that it is important to be compliant about taking the medication as prescribed. Missing 1 day can bring on the brain ""zaps"" and a general unwell feeling. I also experience unsettling dreams if I miss doses. I take 60 mg a day. That seems to be a good therapeutic dose for me. The downfall is the ravenous appetite that others have experienced as well as feelings of weakness Eating does not relieve the hunger or the weakness, but seems like the only logical thing to do to relieve the symptoms. As a result I have gained 5 pounds in a short time and if I continue on this track I will continue to gain weight. This is my biggest concern since I am normally fit, thin and strong and currently feel exactly the opposite of that. It's a trade off feeling mentally good, but physically not so much. Not sure what to do about it. All SSRIs and SNRIs cause those symptoms for me."

I'm not a depressive person, although I'd been under a lot of stress so I hoped it'd kill 2 birds with one stone, so to speak. Well... first morning after starting it, my eyes were so wide it felt like they were bugging out of their sockets! Weird, but it went away a week or so later. Next 5 months were uneventful. Didn't help pain at ALL. Not a bit. Doc increased the dose. Muscle tremors and jerks were happening every night when I'd start to relax. Huge, deep muscle twitches that would jerk me into a jack-knife position in bed. Very scary and weird. Next few months were again rather uneventful. I wanted to stop taking it because the only reason I started was pain control but my doc wanted me to stay on it for a year (why? don't know). At the one year marker, I let the Rx expire. And that's when the REAL fun began. I started getting muscle zaps; my whole body felt like I was being hit everywhere with a cattle prod. Loud noises, startle reflexes, stairs, rapid movement, turning my head...all these caused a zap feeling in my head that reverberated down my spine, into my arms and legs... It was awful. The depression that came down on top of that was horrific. It started the day before Christmas and continued until the first of February, which was the last day I noticed the zaps. It's now March 22 and I'm still feeling drained and a little depressed. There should be a BIG warning label about these types of side effects from going off it! I had Guillian Barre' Syndrome 22 years ago and wonder if having had an auto-immune disease in the past could have messed with the drug's interaction with me. Nevertheless, I could never recommend this drug to anyone...not even an enemy if I had one.

Before I started taking this drug I Had a 3.4 grade point average. I was even inducted into Kappa Beta Delta Honor Society. About 4 months after starting Cymbalta, my depression worsened, my grade point average dropped to below 2.0, and I stopped paying my bills. Last August I quit taking Cymbalta ""cold turkey"". The paranoia and brain zaps were the worst of the withdrawals, there were others. Now I am trying to get not only my life, but my husband's and child's as well back together. What I'm trying to get at, is this drug did nothing for the nerve pain or my depression. So Please be very careful. If you notice yourself just not caring about anything talk to your doctor don't wait like I did. Before you know what's going on it might be to late. "
2335$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$3/20/2010 10:17:15 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$5$It made my hair fall out!!  Started taking Cymbalta for a sudden, major depressive episode.  It worked well at first, but soon the dry mouth and tremors became a problem.  It stopped working after a few months, so Wellbutrin was added.  My hair had also begun to fall out.  Weaned off the Cymbalta for that reason, which caused severe vertigo for several weeks, but eventually the side effects stopped.  I lost about half my hair, which hasn't really started growing back yet after 6 months.  That has been the most traumatic, and certainly didn't help with the depression.  I never would have taken Cymbalta had I known that was a documented side effect.  I'm now doing well on Wellbutrin extended release.  I've tried many antidepressants over the years and it is a trial and error process, but I would be wary of Cymbalta.

I have used Cymbalta combined with Neurontin since my injury in 2002. It works well with the Neurontin to alleviate the nerve pain. I use the generic,of Neurontin, Gabapentin for a huge savings. I learned last year,when our economy hit the floor & so did my income, that Lilly, manufacturers of Cymbalta will pay for all or a large amount of the Cymabalta if you qualify. 
I encourage you to ask your dr. about combining these two rx's if Cymabalta is not effective enough on its own. 
I take them at night as they will make you feel kind of loopy. And you may have dry mouth. Small side effects for me.
Thank God my Neurologist was smart enough to do this for me.
Good Luck.."

(Of course I was also secretly hoping that it might help with the depression.) I was dreading the old routine of working through the days or weeks of side effects and was delighted with the fact that at first there were relatively few. But by the 6th day I felt greater and greater malaise, no improvement at all with the hot flashes and I definitely felt more depressed.  AND THEN THERE'S THE COST!!!

I took it for about 5 months maybe I should have continued but overall the side effects were not worth it. My personality was serious effected.  My doctor did not believe me until I had ""an episode"" at her office . . . needless to say she prescribed something else.  "

Then all of a sudden I started feeling weird, I would get these ""zaps"", like a quick zap of electricity. At first it was just every once in a while, like when i was sick, then it got more frequent.  I tried to cut back and things got really bad!  I had heart and brain ""zaps"" and they began to get much, much worst as soon as i would take my pill.  I couldn't take it so i decided to just stop, taking them didn't help and not taking them didn't help so I decided to just get this horrible drug out of my system.  I am glad I decided to go cold turkey as apose to tapering off, but it WAS NOT easy!!  For 2 weeks I delt with the ""zaps"" all day and all night. they would get so bad that they would jerk my body, like a really bad case of the hiccups would do, my mind was a mess, my body hurt like hell, my heart felt like it was literally jumping around in my chest!!  It was like nothing I'd ever felt in my whole life!! It felt like the zaps were NEVER going to stop!  I also take ativan, but it didn't help with the withdrawls.  I ended up having to take 2 2mg Xanax a day till they stopped just to get some relief.  I realize that every med affects everyone differently, but I would strongly suggest doing research and thinking twice before taking this!"

He took me off the Lyrica which had been prescribed for me by my arthritis doc. The Lyrica worked well for me but gave me blurry vision. Even with a clean brain MRI this doctor panicked and yanked me off of the Lyrica without weaning me off and put me on Cymbalta. It was a month of pure hell while on Cymbalta. I felt like I was mentally deficient. Trying to be politically correct when I say that. To be honest, the word I used with the PM doctor was ""moronic"". I was confused, had balance problems, couldn't follow simple verbal instructions or follow a conversation, etc...I told myself I would give it a full month to see if the side effects would wane, but they never did. On my next appt with the pain doctor, he actually increased the Cymbalta! Said I was probably not on an effective dose (huh?) so he bumped it up to over the max recommended. 2 weeks later, I had my regular checkup with my arthritis doctor and explained what the pain doc did with the meds. The Cymbalta had made me so confused, caused my speech to slur, and affected my balance and gait to the point of bumping into walls and tripping over my feet, that the this doc shook her head and told me she would wean me off the Cymbalta and put me back on the Lyrica. Said she couldn't imagine why this pain doc would increase the dose beyond the max if I presented with such severe side effects. The Cymbalta didn't even help at all with my pain. Not one iota. I had taken two giant steps forward while on the Lyrica and ended up taking 40 backward when put on the Cymbalta. 

I truly hate this med. I am also sick and tired of doctors who try to shove antidepressants down their patients' throats for any ailment their patients present with.      "

The level of pain I have lived with for over 7 years prevented me from being social and enjoying my life as well as nor being able to care for  my family. Cymbalta helped on the second day I took it, lessening the pain by 60-70%. I actaully sleep 5-6 hours straight now.

I am very sensitive to most meds so with my doctor's permission I only take 10-15 mg a day but it sure helps. I open the capsule, pour out 1/2 the drug ( 30 mg capsule)and put the capsule back together.  I tried 20 mg a day but the side effects were intolerable.  I have gotten more relief from Cymbalta than any other drug I've tired.  I pray it keeps working well without me having to increase the dosage.  I stlll have a  bad day of pain now and then but overall I am much better.

After seeing several doctors trying to figure out what was wrong with me I finally found one doctor that told me ""it might be depression"".  The first week on cymbalta was horrible -- fatigue, dry mouth, constipation and numbness.  After the first 6 weeks i felt great and stuck to it for one year. However I had a lot of bad side effects -- I gained 15lbs, my hair shed on and off, my abdomen swelled to the point where people thought i was pregnant and lastly was the acne (which I never had in my life).  However, I remained on the treatment for one year and have recently weaned off(with doctors supervision).  This process was very difficult.  I had diarehhea, brain zaps and insomnia for 10 days straight. I weaned off in about 1 month.  Now after my first episode of depression a year ago I feel great.  I feel like my old self again.

This drug also harmed my nervous system, I had uncontrollable belching while taking this drug and got off.  The belching did slow down but I still have belching enough to drive me into the ER and was just in the hospital for two days trying to get it to stop.  The drug has permeately effected my sympathetic nervous system.  I took the drug about 4 almost 5 years, this is a very dangerous drug.  I have reported this finding to the the FDA, but as you can see drug companies and doctors are pushing this drug like candy.  I also took Miralax with the drug, but it still caused constipation enough so that I had a hernia repair in my rectum and vaginal wall.  I am now using a tens unit and get far greater results with a tens unit and taking Norco and Dilaudid when I am acute.  This drug does not cure Fibromyalgia pain, it might mask the pain some, but after long term use you don't feel like it helps at all other than killing your nervous system, who needs that!  BE AWARE!

I don't believe this is such a great treatment, I was at 120mg quickly. I only saw good effects at each increase for about a month. There are other meds out there that can be used together and not cause such adverse side effects when one wants to come off cymbalta.  I feel the public needs to be made aware of the total concept that comes when one chooses to starts this med.  I am not happy with the total results at 102mgs, and I started at 30mgs. I have had other drugs added and stopped to make this drug work up to the potential it claims.  NO WHERE did I read of ""Brain Zaps"" as a possible reaction in all the literature I read previous to starting or wanting to STOP taking this drug. Only after searching the web did I discover what I was in for in STOPPING. FDA needs to get a much better handle on the true public info put out by the drug comnpanies which claim this is a ""Safe drug"".  Safe for the growth of their own pockets only.  I know of noone who has had great results or few effects especially when withdrawing from this med.  Just search the wed on cymbalta withdrawl and you'll find what I'm saying. I have been on Cymabalta for over 2+yrs. I would of come off this a year ago, but my Psych said ""no"". In order to get off I have had to research on my own and make contacts with other doctors and pharmacist. This is the worst time I have ever had coming off of any med, or alcohol bing or 1960-70's drugs(which I didn't indulge in a lot) SAD ;("

Switching was a disaster!  Cymbalta is the best medication I have used.  It controls the pain of fibromyalgia very well and the depression is relieved to a manageable degree.  I take several other medications for bipolar, seroquel and topamax, and dexadrine so I can stay awake and alert during the day, and buspar for nighttime teeth grinding.  It's a lot of meds, but I'm surviving.  I live in the Pacific Northwest right now and the constant rain and dreary weather do not help, but we are moving and hopefully, the depression will improve with more sunshine.  I highly suggest Cymbalta.  I know different meds work for different people, but this one is worth a try.  I've used almost everyone out there and this is one of the best by far.  I've been medicated for since I was 12 and that's been 25 years now.  No novice here!  =)  Good luck with relief for your pain and depression.  God bless!

My rheumatologist put me on Cymbalta due to fibromyalgia type pain and said it would help. After approximately three years, I am not feeling any difference in pain and have had to have lumbar epidural steroid injections. Since taking Paxil, I put on 20 lbs and since Cymbalta, I've put on 10 more lbs. As far as energy, I have none and have no desire to do things I used to do. My sex drive is so low, but I don't allow myself to let it get bad between my husband and myself. It feels as though I have lost my drive to be the best I can be.

I am slowly weaning myself off Cymbalta with my primary doctor's help, going from 60 mg to 30 mg every other day. I hope to be completely off Cymbalta by March 1st.  I do not like being on these drugs anymore since I've lost almost 15 years of who I was.  I don't know if doctors know or care who we were before we started taking anti-depression medications.  I am going to search for a psychologist who will work with me without mind altering medications and hope that I can lose the weight I gained before my health is jeopardized any more.  

I prefer to take xanax when I have anxiety, it also works well for the pain I feel, as I tend to have panic attacks when I hurt!  Xanax was given to me over 35 years ago to control pain and it is the ONLY thing that helped with panic attacks... and didn't make me gain tons of weight!!   "

I was taking 75mg of Zoloft x's 2 years after having my 1st child and experienced loads of anxiety. I was switched to Cymbalta 60mg 1x's daily and I am not sure of how to take it so far. I have been taking the drug for almost 1 year. I was switched to this because I was having alot of joint pain (arthritis) & excessive tiredness. At first, I got more energy, but now I am still extremly lethargic! I am soooooo tired, this is a possiblity a cause of my arthritis, but I am still unsure. If I miss a dose by 1 day, the wd's or ""side effects"" or whatever you want to call them are way worse than the Zoloft. I start feeling ""loopy"" kinda like I am not really here - Like an outer body experience. As far as the ""brain zaps"" people are writing about, I have experienced them. I seem to loose concentration and get alot of muscle cramps and joint pain and get excessivly tired-----even more than I am on a daily basis. It takes atleast 2 full days of taking the Cymbalta again if I miss 1 day to get back to ""normal"" ways of feeling. It is the more expensive ""co-pay"" on my insurance as well, so that is not the best. "

I find it takes the edget off anxiety/depression, but doesn't eliminate it.  I often need to take a Klonopin to 'settle down' my physical symptioms.  I'm also feeling lately like I'm not really experiencing much emotion, sort of a semi-catatonia, with more sadness than I'm used to.  I'd like to try to get off the drug, but if I fall back into a disabling spate of anxiety it could mean 1-3 months of not working.

I've been told that Pristiq is a similar drug, so I'm going to ask my doctor about switching.

I had been suffering from PTSD for almost 14 years and never knew what I was going through until I decided to do some research for myself which eventually led me to see a psychiatrist.  They say that it takes about 4 weeks for the medicine to get into your system before it starts to work, but I felt results within the first few days - certainly by the first week - of taking Cymbalta.  I felt normal again.  Maybe it worked so fast for me because I wasn't suffering from depression as a lot of other users were.  I started on 30mg and moved up to 60mg within a week.  The only side effects I had from the 60mg was extreme sleepiness (a lot of yawning) and I was unable to obtain an orgasm.  I went back down to 30mg, still some sleepiness although not as much, and I am able to achieve an orgasm.  Unfortunately the sensitivity I used to get from my nipples is no longer there.  They aren't numb or anything, I just don't get aroused anymore when they are touched (sorry if that's TMI, but I just want to let people know what may or may not happen to them while taking Cymbalta).  I'm going down to 20mg in a few days and I pray that the sensual feeling I used to get from my nipples being touched will return.  Oh yeah, I even skip a day sometimes and no terrible side effects.

I've also gained quite a bit of weight - but that is related to my overeating complex too.  As far as side effects - nothing that I can tell.  The withdrawals are horrible though.

Similar to the sound of a cymbal.  Another thing is  I had lost 80 pounds prior to starting Cymbalta,  I have kept it all off while on Cymbalta for 4 years.  I'd hoped to lose more but at least I haven't gained.  I now seem to have more trouble with OCD,  so I am about to go off Cymbalta and try Luvox cr.

Most have no effect on me at all. Cymbalta, however, made me feel impulsively suicidal (not the usual ""maybe everything would be better if I wasn't here"" thoughts those of us with severe depression have, but very scary and almost uncontrollable impulses to harm myself were prominent). Cymbalta also made me more emotional and my already frequent, uncontrollable crying spells only increased and became more severe. This drug must work for some people if it's out there but my personal experience was absolutely awful and I would not recommend Cymbalta to anyone who does not have the benefit of constant contact and/or is living with supportive people who understand your condition, because if your experience is anything like mine you'll feel too low to even go back to the doctor to get help."

If I miss it entirely I know it will be 24-48 hours before I feel okay again.  Some have asked what Brain Zaps are..... I describe them as kind of like an electric shock/dizziness and blankness all at once.  I have insomnia now as well and have gained 25 pounds.  I am very fearful of coming off of them so that my husband and I can have another child.  It has completely taken away my anxiety and the severe bouts with depression and suicidal ideations.  I still, however have never regained any intrest in doing anything.  I haven't tried therapy and have put all my hopes into medication, which is lazy, I know.  I don't believe I would recommend this medication to anyone unless you'd tried several others first.

I went off it about 8 months ago and now am back on due to current situation. I simply function better with meds. I want to tell everyone that Cymbalta is no worse going through withdrawl than other meds. It's scary if you don't understand it but it's a normal withdrawl process and something that lasts a few weeks. Symptoms are the same as when you start the med. It's just your body adjusting. If you're new to antidepressants, the whole thing can be a scary experience but a lot has to do with your perception and expectations. If you're apprehensive and looking for symptoms, you'll feel all of them. None of the withdrawl effects are that horrible compared to any other antideppressant. Paxil I heard is the worst. For me, the benefits far outweighed the negative side affects.

When I was first diagnosed as a child I was put on paxil and it helped but later in life was switched to Cymbalta because of sexual side effects with paxil. Cymbalta worked great for my panic attacks, it gave me energy I felt great, I didn't have the constant overwhelming anxiety over my head and it was amazing... until the effects started wearing off. After about a year it felt like the Cymbalta was sucking energy from me instead of giving it to me, I was tired physically and mentally, I started getting bran zaps, sometimes slurred speech, confusion or brain fog, and I could feel the anxiety slowly creeping back in the picture. So my doctor switched me over to Prozac however getting off of Cymbalta is no easy task! You experience horrible withdrawal symptoms such as: horrible physical pain and weakness, brain fog, uncontrollable muscle tremors, extreme nausea, feelings of being lost or out of place, intense periods of depression and crying, heart palpitations, dizziness, extreme anger, migraines, and the list goes on. To say the least, it's no cake walk and you probably will slip and take one just for a break in the withdrawal symptoms but be strong and stay at it and the symptoms will slowly subside. I finally stopped having withdrawal symptoms about 2 months after stopping Cymbalta. I implore anyone researching Cymbalta to try Prozac first; I've been on it for about a year and a half now and couldn't be happier. I hope this helps! Always remember you're not alone in this and stay positive. Never give up hope, life is beautiful behind the veil of depression and anxiety. Tomorrow the sun will rise and bring with it a new day with many new possibilities :) God bless!

I take OTC pain relievers in between.

After reading the reviews I saw that other patients had the side effect of ""brain zap"" and ""heart zaps"". I didn't know what was causing these symptons before reading the reviews. For me it is like an electrical current ""zap"" that comes out of nowhere. I almost always have trouble sleeping and wake up to a jolt-like feeling during the night and in the morning.It freaks me out and it really seems to hit more often when I am sleeping and/or relaxed. I have VERY strange and vivid dreams and frequent nightmares. I used to love to walk and excercise but not very often since starting this med. That being said, I am not depressed like I used to be but I am not enthusiastic either. Sex drive leaves alot to be desired. I am very seriously considering stopping this drug even though I am worried about what will happen if I do."

Cymbolta needs to supply a larger doseage for some of us or we may have to go to another axiety pill.
cymbolta makes me more calm, I don't over react to things i use to. It also helps me not spout off at the mouth and hurt peoples feelings. I love my cymbolta. just which they would make it in larger doses."

2633$Condition: Other$11/11/2009 9:46:51 AM$Reviewer: Nay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month$3$3$5$"Just started taking Cymbalta after it came highly reccommended from my Psychiatrist. Have tried Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor, Pristiq, Seroquel(for sleep), Trileptal. Gave all of these at least a month but wasn't sleeping well. Could have lost sleep, tried to get through the side effects period but sleep is more important if you have sleep issues for 10 years. So far Cymbalta seems okay after a few days, I take Melatonin 1.5 to 3 mg for sleep and a Cortisol herb for keeping it low during the night so not to awaken at 3:00am. I have a small Pituitary tumor that is causing the problems, high cortisol, anxiety, ect. So I know the reason and until it shrinks I must treat the symptoms with medications, Cymbalta and 100 mg Lamictal. I tried to have an operation to remove it but they couldn't reach it as I bleed too much. So back to plan B, shrink it with alternative ways. Omegas or medicinal mushrooms.
I don't know if anyone out there has gotten to the root cause of your depressions or anxiety as I have. It may be more than a chemical imbalance. Food allergies, gluten intolerance, low thyroid, pituitary or adrenal tumors, although Rare, ect. Your primary docs can run blood tests to check for food allergies and hormone levels like thryoid, adrenals ect. There are saliva tests you can google on line to check all sorts of things in the body, these test are very accurate and you can bring them to your doctors. The docs are so quick to give out meds. but don't run these tests unless you ask them. We are the advocates for our own bodies and must do the leg work to feel 100% better. The meds. help but sometimes are not he only answer as they may not address the root cause. Anyway, I have been researching for 10 years and finally think I am on the road to restoring my health. Good luck to you all. Hope this helped and don't give up, the answer can be simple."

To everyone who's posted on here about being in withdrawal from it, hang in there!! The symptoms with go away completely within a couple of months. One other major complaint I have about this stuff is it totally sucked away my motivation to exercise. Before I started taking it I was working out and running on a semi-regular basis and after a few weeks on cymbalta I had stopped entirely. I think the anti-anxiety part of it sort of sucks away your excess energy. Which I guess sort of makes sense because while I was on it I didn't get enraged over stupid things like I do sometimes before and after I was on it. All in all I think a decent diet, some exercise and trying to keep  yourself busy with things you enjoy doing is a better solution than cymbalta. If I ever feel like I need to go back on anti-depressants I think I'll try something that is a little more well tested and documented.

I don't believe the doctors were properly educated on this terrible drug so in turn patients aren't able to make a clear educated decision as to take this medication to begin with. I have placed a complaint with th FDA as well as with Eli Lilly. I have also placed a complaint with his doctor.

Get online and type in Cymbalta withdrawal and Cymbalta side efffects and see the other hundreds of people who are suffering with little to no help from the medical field. Also, you will see the desperate attempts of some who are trying to get off this drug. There WILL be a death as a result of some of these tactics and I forsee a class action law suit in he future for Eli Lilly and any of the medical professionals who refuse to hear the cries of so many desperate people.

I thought I had found a great one when I started taking Cymbalta back in February.  Sure, the adjustment period wasn't great (but I did lose some weight from the loss of appetite!), but my mood seemed better and all that.  I increased from 30 mg up to 60 about 3 mos later.  Then starting in about June, I noticed my terrible insomnia and lack of energy.  I have gained weight, causing me great distress, because I have no energy to work out and no food is completely satisfying so I eat more.  It finally occurred to me last week that it could be the Cymbalta so I stopped taking it cold turkey.  Immediately, my sleep improved, I have happier dreams, and I feel more energetic during the day.  My only problem now is suffering through this wretched withdrawal.  I feel hungry, but I can't keep any food down, and the vertigo and ""brain zaps"" are awful.  I have never had withdrawal from any Rx like this.  I hate feeling sick, but I know I need to get through it to be happy again.  I am in a stable emotional situation now, so I feel like I can live without any medication once I get my energy back.  I only wish I had made the connection earlier."

I've tried Cymbalta 3 times and has already made my depression noticeably worse.  I've given it a good amount of time.

I started reading the advertisements about Fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain but was somewhat skeptical.  My skepticism turned out right in my case.  My pain levels were MUCH, MUCH worse.  I really wish Cymbalta wasn't a sponsor and all over the place on this site advertising about Fibromyalgia pain.  It must work for some people, but plain 'ol Prozac worked better in my specific case. 

I also take a ton of other meds for the pain and symptoms of FMS, including Norco, Zanaflex, Neurontin (Lyrica), Ibuprofen and I've forgotten a few.

One warning, don't take tramadol (Ultram) with SSRI's as you can get a very serious condition called ""Serotonin Syndrome"" which I had.  I didn't see any warnings above.  Taking ""regular narcotics"" unlike tramadol, like Vicodin and Oxycontin is OK with SSRI's according to my pharmacist.

I just don't like seeing them advertising and be approved for fibromyalgia pain.  I've had it 17 years and have tried (and researched) everything.  I was taking Neurontin many years before it (Lyrica-similar) was approved for FMS.

But I must say, I am happy that in that 17 years, doctors are finally starting to understand the devastation of Fibromyalgia a little better.

Unfortunately, if you asked the average person if they've ever heard of it, they'd say no unless they knew someone with it.  And even if they did, they still wouldn't quite understand the devastation.

I do like the multiple articles addressing FMS on this site now, but I see the darned Cymbalta ads on top of every one.  And the placebos are catching up to the drugs now.

I think (I may be wrong) when Prozac was approved, it had was 47 percent effective as compared to 43 percent on the the placebo.  And that was enough for them to make billions.

It helped to control my anxiety attacks and the underlying depression symptoms.  The problem though is getting off this stuff.  The withdrawals are terrible.  Brain zaps, foggy brain, loss of thoughts, dizzy feelings, nausea.  Do not, I repeat do not follow the canned Dr. instructions to tapper off over 2-3 weeks.  It really takes 4-6 weeks. My doctor said to cut the 60 mg. to 30 for a week, then go 30 mg every other day for a week.  Bad idea!  I am tapering it off over 4 weeks more by opening the capsules and reducing by 1/4 each week.  Still have side effects, but not as bad.

So one day my Dr.switched me to Paxil. What a great drug.It worked like no other antidepressant I had ever been on. I remember how I was afrad to tell anyone how good I felt because i was afraid it would stop working!I was on it for about 6 or 7 years before it actually did stop working. So Dr. tried me on Cymbalta,
it is another miracle drug. I have taken cymbalta for about 3 years and feel great. I don't cry all the time, and I don't worry about everyting.I don't see my problems as huge obsticals anymore,only tiny hills!!! I have read about the withdrawal symptoms and I don,t care about the withdrawal symptoms because if I have suffered with depression for over 31 years I don't see myself ever getting off the meds. I don't even want to try actually. I hope this helps someone who might be considering trying a med for depression.They work and can help you get your life and feelings back in order."

Started out with 30mgs for a month then went to 60mgs for a month. At first everything was okay, just a lot of yawning and sleeping. Then I began to have night sweats, started getting shaking, & headaches. After about a month of 60mgs I had completely cut myself off from having a social life & began having horrible thoughts of not wanting to live. Also began having uncontrolled crying fits and screaming at my boyfriend for no reason at all. No memory of these occurances. Began walking around in my sleep and moving things around my house. Decided to take myself off the med by going back down to 30mgs for 2 weeks & then stopping completely. Was the worst withdrawal symptoms of my life. Last night I had a mirgrane for 6 hours, threw up, and cried for at least 45 minutes straight for no reason. Woke up with the shakes. I do not suggest this drug for any one!!!!

For the first month, I hated this medicine.  It caused headaches, dizziness and constipation.  It was helping with none of my pain, and I wanted to go off of it for fear of all of the bad side effects I had heard about.  Now...I have been on this medicine for 9 months and it has saved my life.  I can now sleep at night, I no longer am stiff in all my joints.  I have spinal stenosis caused by degenerative disc and facet disease.  I spent years taking different pain killers and receiving shots.  Nothing worked and Cymbalta was my last hope before surgery.  Lyrica made me feel dead, so I gave Cymbalta a try.  i am so glad I didn't give up.  My life is so much better now.  My body hasn't felt this good since I was a teenager.  I have also lost 15 lbs since it does drop your appetite somewhat.  I have done several reviews on this drug over the past 9 months.  Each month that goes by I am happier and happier with my progress.  I have almost forgotten the days that i couldn't get out of bed in the morning or bend over to pick up my son.  I am sure it doesn't work for everyone, as all drugs react differently for different people, but give it more than a month before you decide.  As for going off of it, I am afraid there will probably be withdrawl type symptoms.  Being a time-released capsule, my body definitely knows when 24 hours has passed and become quite dependent on this drug.  I will take that chance though for the way I feel every day now.  I am raising 4 children and this is the best I have ever felt after giving birth to any of them.  Cymbalta has saved me from surgery and makes my life so much easier and pain free.

My Dr. had also thought that perhaps it would improve my mood, as I had become more and more recluse as my chronic pain disorder had progressed over the years. There was no significant change of my mental outlook as well. But I did have a sudden onset of breathing difficulties. My airway closed up for about fifteen to twenty seconds, twice within a minute or two. I had never had any type of anxiety attack or asthmatic condition before, nor since because I was instructed to discontinue use immediately. Also, I was already having difficulty urinating, which worsened while taking Cymbalta.

However, I suffered from insomnia while on it and I ultimately switched to a different antidepressant when I experienced the rare side effect of increased urination.  I was waking up 8-10 times a night to urinate.  My doctor told me that this is not very common at all but it does happen.  Other than that, the med works well as an anti-depressat.  Truth is I haven't found one antidepressant that hasn't given me insomnia.

Have tried all types of meds. The combination of Cymbalta & Wellbutrin is what helped me be able to get out of bed and have some sort of life. The pain has always been a constant. I take Vicodin about 3 times a day.
Now with a little over 2 years, my combo plan of Cymbalta & Wellbutrin has quit on me. 
Just started Savella 3 days ago and coming off of Cymbalta.
I have been SO dizzy I'm knocking into things. That is ""without"" Vicodin for the inquiring minds that would like to know. I took the pain med later but needed to know that wasn't the problem.
So if the Cymbalta isn't fulling changing things for you with FM&CF ask your doc about adding the Wellbutrin. It gave me energy that I hadn't had in YEARS!
I would set my clock for 6a.m. take my meds and go back to sleep. About 2 hours later I had a new me! I miss her.....Hope this helps someone."

Next my top lip sweled up, than I started having horrible indigestion, last but not least I woke up one morning with my eyes and face so swollen I immediately called my Dr. and told him I was getting off of this drug. He said to cut back to 30 mg for 4 to 5 days. I was on 60 mg. I took 30 mg for two days and than quit taking it. It's been 10 days and I'm still suffering with all these side effects.. but not as severe. My dr. said it could take 21 days for it to leave my system. It's been a nightmare. No body else mentions having any of these side effects but I never experienced feeling like this until I was on the cymbalta. I do not care for the drug but hope others are more successful with it.

He prescribed Cymbalta for me,  after a while I told him I wasn't sure if it was helping me,  and I wanted to quit it for awhile.  A couple of weeks off the Cymbalta,  the pain got so bad I called the doctor and said,  I believe the Cymbalta was in fact working,  because I was getting crippled with pain.
I do reccommend it.  I also have Osteoarthritis....which it helps too,  but I also get injections in my shoulder & knee of Orthovisc, twice a year.  It all helps me cope with the pain that I experience daily.  "

Ive been on every antidepressant in existance over the past 10 years. Nothing ever worked and I just walked around like a zombie with no care for my life at all.
Cymbalta has woken me up and I can go outside and smile and drive and am so happy. My 2 children and the rest of my family are amazed.
I can't make it without Cymbalta and now...
I tried to refill my Cymbalta on 8/17/09 because I only had enough to get me through 8/18/09. Walmart and Sams insurance no longer pays for Cymbalta and I had all of one day notice before I ran out of medication. It will cost over $450 to refill. I don't even have $100 in my bank account. I am sooooooooo upset and terrified. Everywhere I call gets no help. I am now out of pills and wont be able to take my morning dose.
I called my doctor 3x on Monday, 8/17/09 and the receptionist called her and I was told that they had no samples.
My next question is ""ok, and?"" I really don't understand. I have read post after post from people going through hell as they get off cymbalta and they had pills to take lower dosages as the days went by. I have NOTHING. God gave me my life back and I am so hurt that I am losing it. I don't want to be the way I used to be. I never left my bedroom and I didnt even check the mail. As of the last month, I am rarely in my room except to sleep and I spend lots of time with my family. My kids deserve to have a real mom for once and they will be hurt by this just as much as it is going to hurt me.
I don't know what to do :(
Please someone help me.

I've had anxiety & depression since my early 20's, & taken every med on the market - Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft, Effexor, Wellbutrin, you name it. When Cymbalta came out, of course I asked my doctor if I could try it. It helped a lot...I didn't have that ""empty, out of it"" feeling I got from the Zoloft & Effexor. I was happy and it helped with the depression, but did NOT do a whole lot for my anxiety (which I realize there are other meds for that, Cymbalta is mainly for the depression). I was pleasant & could think clearly and function normally, for the most part.
However...I gained a LOT of weight while I was on Cymbalta. I didn't know this was a side-effect when I started taking it, and the Cymbalta really ""packed it on"" (to the tune of about 25 lbs in 4 months). I never gained that kind of weight on the other depression meds that I've taken in the past.
On a scale of 1-10, I'd give Cymbalta a 7 in regards to it's effect on the depression. In the end, I couldn't deal with the weight gain (I've never been an overweight person), so I asked my doctor to put me back on the Wellbutrin, which has a similar effect as Cymbalta (in my experience) but without the weight gain. This is just my experience with the drug. Cymbalta isn't horrible at all, actually it helps a great deal...but it made me gain a lot of weight, so I switched back to something that I knew worked just as well & didn't cause the weight gain. Give it a try, everyone's experiences & reactions to these kinds of medications are different. Unfortunately Cymbalta just wasn't for me.

I thought I felt better and I thought I was dealing with life better. Now that I dumped all my pills down the toilet, because, I couldn't afford them and I was tired of being dependent on a pill, I feel so much better. On Cymbalta or any of the other depression pills I have been on I never really felt better. I thought I was better because the Doctors always told me, this will make you feel better. I have been on depression medication since I was 16 years old and I am now 28 (I couldn't remember what it was like to not be on a pill). Now that I am off my medication my suicidal thoughts have almost depleted. I don't feel so tired all the time and my IBS is going away. Not to say that depression medication does not help people, but, I can honestly say that I feel 10 times better being off of it than I did on it. I hope this helps someone.

Had two weeks of side effects i.e. profuse sweating, anxiety, sleeplessness,constipation. After 2 weeks saw improvement in moods.Occasionally my blood pressure and heart rate soared for a few hours, leading to a couple of ER visits.Also,had episodes of feeling like I had boiling water in my veins, as if my internal temp was soaring. I never connected this to the cymbalta until recently. I went from 60 mg to 30 mg 2 years ago, and recently tried to wean off by taking every other then evry 3rd day. During this time was given hydrocodone for pain. The combination of these did something to me that i still dont understand. I had a seizure, fainted, vertigo, dizziness, stomach upset with vomiting, continuous panic attacks(xanax doesnt help) and severe internal overheating.Read up on seritonin syndrome and cymbalta withdrawals. Both seem to have same symptoms. This is the worst med in the world! For all the good it did me I have never felt so terrible since being off it for only 3 days! Even tried opening capsule and taking about .25 of the pellets. Made things worse! Pray for me and please don't take this drug without very close supervision and only as a last resort.

I looked it up online and decided that it would be safe enough, hassle-free enough, and so I asked my doctor for a prescription.

After about two months, I noticed that I was getting small lumps under my skin -- about a dozen of them -- that seemed to be growing kind of fast.  I didn't associate it with Cymbalta, they didn't actually hurt, and I had a follow-up appointment with my doctor in about a month, so I didn't do anything.

Then, we discovered a lump in my breast, on my chest wall and immovable.  Needless to say, I went to the doctor right away.   He said he didn't know the cause of any of the bumps, but got me a referral to a surgeon right away for the one in my breast.  

I had the lump removed -- went through the risk of surgery with general anesthesia.  The cytology showed that the lump was not cancer, but a lipoma -- a cyst of fat.

I looked up every one of my meds online, read every single possible problem with them.  Lo and behold one of the things Cymbalta could do was cause lipomas.  I  took myself off of it, tapered off.

That was all about 4 years ago.   I still have the other lumps, though they might be marginally smaller. "

Initially, it worked pretty well. However, over time it was just like the Effexor. I had gone off Effexor in the past and suffered only minor feelings of restlessness, anxiety, sweating and some nausea. Not so with Cymbalta. I ran out, and within 4 days of having weaned myself off (I went from 120 mg to 60 to 0), began feeling such despair and hopelessness. I was sweating profusely, felt disoriented - like I didn't belong anywhere, crying, my entire body began to spasm. I vomited (severe, wretched) for 3 days. I couldn't even keep water down. I became dehydrated. I was shaking and shivering so hard my teeth rattled. I now have an idea what a junkie must feel like when detoxing from Heroin. I felt like a complete zombie. I have never felt so horrible in all my life. Whatever you do, DO NOT stop using Cymbalta unless you're in the hospital or have a health care professional in your home. I went back on Cymbalta as soon as I found someone to go to the pharmacy. There was no alternative. It would appear that I'll be taking this medication for the rest of my life. I can't go through the withdrawals agan. No way. I lost 2 weeks of my life. I don't know what it's the pharmacological make-up of this drug is. How can it cause such horrific symptoms when your body is deproved of it when it really doesn't work all that great?

He used to be very active but now sleeps all the time. He has also gained weight which I thought was from his inactiveness but now I see is a side effect. I went with him to the Dr. about changing his meds, all the Dr.  did was up the dosage.. My kids and I have asked him to go off Cymbalta but he is afraid to. He gets very ill if he misses even one dose. I wish he never started taking it!  If you are thinking of taking it, please don't!

Swelling in my colon so bad I couldn't sit up. Was in bed exhausted. thought I was going to die from dehydration or liver problems. Quit cold turkey and got better right away but quitting made me very dizzy and very cold for several days. Worse medicine I've ever been on. Started at 30mg, then went to 60mg. Pamelor, Celexa, Zoloft, Buspar, Paxil never gave me this much trouble. Recommend getting a liver panel first and be wary if you have liver, stomach, or intestinal problems. Was on it three months.

I went on this for treatment of nerve pain related to my back. The first 4 weeks or so - I only noticed that I was more tired during day - but then during week 6 I started with an ""out-of-body"" type of disorientation, weird dreams, nodding off without warning - and then the dizziness started - horribly sick to my stomach if I moved my head the wrong way. I realized that my bloated stomach, weight gain and indigestion was also related to this horrible drug. I am withdrawing now and it isn't pretty. It is so hard to explain but this drug makes you feel like you have no control over your thoughts and that you are not yourself. I have suffered with back pain for over 8 years and I have never stayed depressed or negative - but this drug has made me feel negative even about HAPPY things. I am getting married in 5 weeks and I can't even enjoy the preparations - I hope the symptoms go away before then! So far everytime drs try out any of the brain chemistry reactions medications - they have bad side effects. But this one is the worst I've ever tried!"

I have peripheral neuropathy. The past 3 months, i stopped taking it cold turkey. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT! It was horrid! The affects of withdrawal was just HORRID! Severe balance/coordination issues, unable to sleep, really bad anxiety, wasn't depressed but was always negative. Now, I feel great! The Cymbalta doesn't really help with chronic pain. I also had severe spasms. I was too afraid to walk, because I was too afraid too fall. The only good thing about it was, I lost weight. I really think that the Cymbalta is out of my system. I also had emotional breakdowns. And cry for no reason. I mean, I wouldn't be upset, I would just have tears down my face. Also, I was jumpy. had nightmares, I felt like I wanted to jump out of my own skin. It was so bad. I am never taking that again. EVER. I now feel great. happy. happier than I have been in AGES. I still have anxiety and everything else that comes with neuropathy pain.

The cravings to EAT were so intense, I had to constantly remind myself to not EAT, but drink water instead.  I hated that feeling; it was like a nicotine withdrawal symptom (I haven't smoked for 15 years!).  I stopped taking it immediately (and didn't wean myself off little by little.)  Although I had some slight headaches and dizzyness, it wasn't bad.  I took ibuprofen and it is almost out of my system.
I have been trying to loose weight and have lost 25 lbs before taking cymbalta.  Cymbalta was sure to make me gain a LOT of weight and that is not a healthy for your heart, etc. obviously. 

This drug works differently for all people obviously.

The first day I took it I noticed 25% pain relief.  I have little to no appetite, restless leg syndrome has worsened with the Cymbalta, sometimes a bit jittery, still have insomnia, been noticing more sweating with exercise.  I really do believe this is helping me, I tried Lyrica to no avail and all the terrible side effects.  My Rheumatologist wants me to try Savella, but I'm afraid of it's side effects.  I can increase the Cymbalta as I'm only taking 30mgs a day, but it is so expensive.  Overall I do believe this has helped lower my pain more than any other medications, or acupuncture, or massage, or exercise.

It started with the constipation, not being able to sleep (including bad dreams), and nausea and progressed into lashing out with horrible mood swings, incrased appetite (which made me gain 12 lbs. in 3 mo). I also constantly felt bloated, sweat frequently, and had an increased heart rate very easily.  It made me feel as if I was extremely out of shape.  The only good thing about Cymbalta was it's ability to almost completely take away my anxiety attacks.  I would not recommend it due to the extreme side effects.

My mouth is constantly dry. I drink gallons of ice water and was still constipated, but now I drink a cup of Traditional Medicinals Smooth Move tea at night, and it works great. I have sun sensitivity, and hot flashes constantly, which drives me nuts, and the wierdest dreams in the world, very detailed! I keep a paper fan with me for hot flashes and watch my time in the sun. I was already overweight, so I ride a stationary bike gently for 2 miles every day, and eat very healthy, and have lost 8 pounds in 3 weeks.

However, I'm also bipolar. I've been on many anti-depressent/anti-anxiety/mood stabilizing meds, but Cymbalta seems to be the best of them all for controlling the depression part of being bipolar.

I've gained about 12 pounds since I started it, but have fortunately not gained more, and it's worth it to me, since it helps control my severe depression.

With a decrease in appetite and eating very little, I am still trying to figure out why I gained 10 pounds. 

My Dr wanted me to go from 60 mg to 90 mg because its effectiveness was wearing off. Two days after going to 90 mg I started having horrible stomach pain. Awoke every morning with nausea, could only eat very little throughout the day. I have taken myself from 90 mg to 60 mg to 30 mg to 30 mg every other day. I have now completely stopped. My head is swimming and my stomach is still having some problems; but getting better. I can eat some what regularly.

It helped with my back and my anxiety; but the side effects were NOT worth it. I would warn anyone that is going to take Cymbalta to do your research and read up on the side effects. If you have them, stop taking it and talk to your doctor. I pointed the side effects out to my Dr; but he wanted me to stay on it for my back. I am now on LorTab 7.5 twice a day. I have been on narcotics before for my back and that was much easier to withdrawal from than Cymbalta."

I have been on and off this medication for 1 1/2 years and have taken a multitude of antidepressants and pain medications including a intrathecal morphine pump.  I find cymbalta has helped somewhat with the depression and pain but the side effects are somewhat troubling.  I have severe hot flashes, sweats with clammy skin. I also have a severe problem with disturbing dreams.  The severe nausea is no longer a problem after the initial loading dosing.  the other patient reviews have been very helpful.  Thank you to you all.  I hope mine as well helps others.

I have been on this now for 5 months and have not noticed any difference in the level of pain I'm experiencing.  I have also noticed that I am needing an excessive amount of sleep (at least 10 hours), and if I don't get that then I will take a 2-3 hour nap in the afternoon.  Other side effects have been dry mouth, and possibly a skin rash, swelling in my hands and lower lip, and it seems like I bruise very easily.  My doctor doesn't seem to think that these last one's are side effects of the medication, but I am not sure.   I also find that I loose my grip on things fairly frequently, but not sure if that is a symptom of fibro or the medication.  In my experience, I do not think this medication is for me. I'm feeling less motivated, having more problems concentrating, and see no difference in the level of pain.  My chiropractor actually thinks my muscles are stiffer on this medication.  I felt better taking the celexa than what I have on this.

This drug is to dangerous for a doctor to send home with his patient without a proper study done, kinda like all the crap I had to go through for a CPAP machine.

I have had no negative side effects from it, and it seems to be working fairly well.  Antidepressants can have very different effects on different people, but for me, this medication has helped more than most others.  I have taken Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Effexor, Trazodone, and many mood stabilizers that have had either no effect or negative effects.  Cymbalta has been a fairly positive help for my depression, and has given me no negative side effects.

I've been on Cymbalta 60mg for 2-3 yrs. I called my Dr and wanted off of it.  It was horrible getting off; changed Neurologists,
and He doubled the amount! I hate taking it because my pain still remains!  I'm 60 and use a walker; retired, take classes etc.
I am just coping with my pain! I wish there were something else for pain that I could take but I would hate trying to get off of it again.  I feel like a drug addict.
I just sort of grin & bear it...ugh! Does anyone else know what else I could try for pain in my neck? Its a horrible pain and often ends in spasm going down arm. It especially hurts when I use computer or drive a car. If I keep my head down while looking up it is LESS PAIN! But it's difficult to do this constantly.

I didn't think I could feel like my old self again anytime soon. Dealing with chronic pain has been overshadowing my life for over a year now and dealing with the constant anxiety was overwhelming. I have been able to start rebuilding the relationships I tore apart, and building my future with my brand new husband. I have to say, had it not been for Cymbalta, I think we would have been divorced 2 & 1/2 months into our marriage. It feels wonderful to laugh again and not force it through my teeth, and the joy of striking up a conversation! I have to admit, the first 2-3 weeks of starting were pretty rough. I lost about 10 lbs due to loss of appetite and nausea. And just having an awkward sensation all over, almost paranoid I would say was bothersome. I didn't want to do anything, I sat on the sofa day and night like a mute, only drinking water and eating an occasional cracker or two. I am still dealing with the constipation but have started taking fiber supplements, the dry mouth is another thing. My doctor suggested I chew sugarless gum but I'm not much into that so I am constantly running in and out of the bathroom. But I smile on the way in and the way out!

It was great at first. I was sleeping better, my moods were SO much better. My Fibro pain was almost gone.  Except for the fact that I couldn't reach the ""O"" and being the sexual person that I am was ruining my relationship! I didn't even want sex. And after about 3 months, I started getting bad sweats all over, feeling clammy. Couldn't sleep as well and the pain was coming back along with the depression. So I started to go from my 60 milligrams to 30 milligrams to wean myself off. I did that for about a week and for the last three days totally off. The nightmares are horrible. Fuzzy head, aggravated, feel just terrible. shooting pains everywhere. I sleep about 2 to 3 hours a night and with nightmares. I wake up with my heart pounding out of my chest. 
Can anyone tell me approximately how long these side affects will go on? I'm determined not to go back on this drug. But I'm hoping I can get over this soon and maybe try Lyrica or something of that nature. My email address is [email protected] If you think you can help with advice, please email me. I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE. It might work for some, but God bless the people trying to get off it."

2992$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$6/29/2009 12:41:27 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$1$"I don't even know where to start! I've been on a variety of different anti-depressants over the years, but Cymbalta has been, by far, the least effective. Not only did I start having very disturbing dreams and restless sleep, but I didn't see any improvement in my mood. I felt more hopeless than ever before. 

One thing that I want anyone considering Cymbalta to know is that the Discontinuation Syndrome for this drug is horrendous. I'm slowly tapering off of Cymbalta right now and it's been the worst experience of my life. I feel like my body is shutting down. I've been incredibly nauseous, irritable, and generally out of sorts. I feel foggy and confused and I don't know what to do about it! I wish my psychiatrist would have told me about this when I started taking Cymbalta. 

Really weigh the pros and cons when considering Cymbalta as an option. Even if this drug does work for your depression (or other needs), if you don't plan on being on it forever, think about the discontinuation side effects because, personally and without being too dramatic, they are destroying my ability to function right now."

I was never this way and the worst side affects in the last 6 months is the itching in my legs and head and the horrible sweating.  It's really bad. I feel like I have bugs crawling in my head and in my legs.  I read about all the drug interactions too.  I should have read them sooner.  You have to really be careful not to take anything that can make your heart stop working.  I tried to wean myself from this medication to no avail.  I had real bad anxiety and crying spells and horrible dreams too.  Is there anything out there that works better.

Yeah, right.)Constipation (for which I take Miralax), no energy, infrequent bouts with suicidal ideation, and feeling dull and uninterested in life are other side effects.  (In other words, the side effects are like the symptoms of depression I had in the first place!)I haven't tried to withdraw from it yet, but am thinking of going to a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner I know to pick his brain about other options before I do that.By the way, has anyone out there tried a new, natural anti-d called ""Serelax""?

I went from Lexapro (where I gained 20 pounds in 6 months) to Cymbalta (up to 60mg. in 2 weeks) where I gained another 30 lbs in 6 months.  Yep, 50 lbe in one year.  I am so upset about it  and have been off for about 4 months.  I finally went to a psychiatrist that specializes in medications. He said I didn't need any of those meds and that they WOULD cause weight in almost everyone.  Yuk.  So he put me on Lamictal.  Said there's no weight gain.  When I took Cymbalta I felt pretty darned good, though, except worrying about my weight all the time.  It made me happy- but I have to admit I was pretty non-emotional.  Now that I've changed meds it is the first time I have cried in over a year!  It actually felt good in a way to have emotions... but I am also more quickly to react angrily.  I am not at a good level yet on the new med.  The cymbalta was really difficult to get off of, too.  Brain zaps were horrible and the headaches were too.  I wish I hadn't gone on it at all.  The positives were far outweighed (LOL) by the negatives for me.

The constipation is so bad I had to see a gastroenterologist because I started bleeding from the rectum and could not have a normal bowel movement. My body felt poisoned by my own waste. I have crazy hot flashes and sweat like I just ran a marathon. Sleeping is a problem, I can get about 5-6 hours and then I am so restless even the dog won't sleep on the bed sometimes. According to my bf I sit up, talk, kick, and toss/turn relentlessly all night. But I have no problem taking a 3 hour nap in the afternoon and find myself yawning all day. My sex drive is gone and it's difficult to have an orgasm, even by myself, not that I even want to try anymore. I've also packed on quite a few pounds and have a giant bloated belly. I look 5 months prego! The fibro pain has returned so I see no point in staying on this med anymore since I feel so physically gross. I am also oddly impulsive and sometimes snap at people for no reason. My doc is weaning me off over the next two weeks. It was great for the first month or so but now I feel awful.

SUMMARY:  For me, the medication successfully removed the anxiety & depression (feeling out of control), but it also made me 100% emotionally numb.  So, I didn't feel ""normal"" just detached from everything."

It does nothing for my fibromyalgia (which would've been a side benefit).  It's one of the drugs I take for bipolar condition.  If I miss a dose I have terrible withdrawal symptoms.

It worked great the first 9 months physically I ws able to excersise again.  (was bed ridden) It took time about 6 weeks to feel the energy back. It took 8-10 weeks to not feel so depressed and my anxiety attacks have almost competely been gone. I was also on Klonipin (which was so addicting) took me 16 weeks to wean off of that. Now I am on 250 mg of lamitial to stablize myself. I am 5 feet I have gained from 115lbs to 155lbs in a very short period of time.. They say do to the cymbalta 60mgs 1 time in the morning...or I cant sleep at night and have nightmares.  I am not feeling that energy any more, my liver enzyme test was elevated. One doc says the meds the other says I gained to much weight to fast do to the meds.. I mentally feel ok.. not soo very very down , but not the best Ive felt.. Probably do to the major amount of stress I amm in now.. I cant deal with things like I use to. Oh well I hope to try to wean off this med soon and try another or less of it.. Oh yea I have never been on any meds before little lone a tylenol.. I had a total nervous break down that left me with out strenght of any kind both mental and physical  it took awhile to fee better I still have 30 % more to go..Good luck every one.

Since the 60 m.g. I have been a nervous wreck, have blurry vision and cannot sleep.  Sleep is very important to relax my muscles for the Fibro so I am calling my M. D. and going back on the Pamelor.  Personally I feel that exercise is the key to Fibromyalgia and I intend to pursue that angle more than the meds.  There's just no good answer for Fibromyalgia!

Wiened myself off the drug, no more suicidal thoughts.  I am on Lyrica 300 mg

This has proven very difficult so I now only take 150mg. daily.

I've been trying to wean off Cymbalta for over 3 months.  I'm down to splitting the 20 mg capsule in half.  It took over a week to stabilize there.  My withdrawal symptoms:
dizzy/uncoordinated--worst symptom--can't exercise much
*nausea--sometimes comes with the *dizziness, feels exactly like motion sickness
*Racing Heartbeat
*Brain Zaps
*Gaining weight--hungry, hungry, hungry, especially for sweets
*Ringing in ears, weird noises
*Badly needing to urinate suddenly
*Panic attacks
*Extra emotional

I only got the last 3 when I went from 10 mg to zero.  Bless you if you don't have these issues.  I would not have taken Cymbalta if I had known about the withdrawal problems.  My doctor, who usually knows the latest info on medications, needs to read up on this.  She is mistrusting my reports.  Bless you if you don't have these problems, but bless you even more if you are in the boat with me."

I put on 35 pounds in 8 months and I am a very healthy eater (veggies, whole grains, etc.), dizziness, disorientation. Missing a dose and taking one the next day caused severe disorientation & dizziness all morning, then extreme fatigue all afternoon (in bed by 7pm)- could sleep anywhere. I didn't sleep well at night when I took the drug either. Woke up numerous times during the night.  Urine problems, went from having to ""go"" to barely having enough time to get my pants undone.  It also caused sexual side effects, but those were fixed by taking 2 small doses of Viagra (I'm female) which got the ball rolling again.  Overall it helped, I am in process of weining off of it now and in reading these reviews, looks like I'll have a long road ahead just getting off of the drug.

I do not want to start another med. too much for your body to go through to get use to.  This is the one for me.  Meds to do cause a death, the severness of the depression does and the sadness that no one can see or no once can cry loud enough for help to come.  I have been there.  That is why all medication has to be monitored- you just cannot take it and run free.

I was at a constant 8-9 pain level, crying in bed, crawling to the bathroom, unable to go to class, work, or even the doctors sometimes. My pain level went from 9 to 5 in the course of my first week of Cymbalta. However, and this is a big however, I developed signs of serotonin syndrome- terrible anxiety, constant drenching sweat, fever, chills, memory loss, falling over, tension and pain in neck, chest and arm, noticeable, uncontrollable tremor, confusion, headache, etc. My memory loss is so bad I can barely discern the two trips I took to the ER for the symptoms from one another. It's just a blur. This was on the starter 30 mg dose. I had to stop taking the drug, which I am very disappointed about (if for no other reason than that I paid for a month's supply which I can't use- it's super expensive). Now it is back to hydrocodone/soma/tylenol/ibuprofen cocktail that will probably ruin my liver. Pain management docs will see me in a few weeks and will hopefully have a new idea. I hope this drug works for everyone without these horrible side effects. It was absolutely terrifying to have my body totally out of my control.

Finally weaned myself off of it, lost 35 lbs,and got on Cymbalta as it is supposed to have a component that treats pain. I was in  consant pain with my back for the past year and very depressed as I could no longer work which was a hardship for the family.The Cymbalta helped my panic and unhappiness regarding the pain, lost job, etc but then i noticed that in the past 3 months, since I started taking it, I gained 27 lbs!! No difference in diet except that i eat healthier and I walk every day so now I am really depressed about being fat and knowing there is nothing I can do about it.
So i do not know if i should get off of it adn if I do, how long will it take to lose the weight and will I be sad and anxious again??                 "

I gain 25lbs from the pill, which was not good, b/c i was getting married and already ordered my dress, but more serious than that, one of the side of effects, is that you can get small or mild tremors.  I was in my mom's kitchen and i could feel like mild vibrations, it was the scariest thing in the world. If anyone decides to take this medicine, please discuss the side effects with your doctor.

I've been on medication for my depression for over 6 years. I've pretty much been on all the major anti depressants- they either didn't work or I built up a tolerance to them. 

I'm at the highest dose possible- 3 of the blue and white pills a day but it still left me drowsy all the time (hence (-) one star for effectiveness) so my docter put me on Provigil too. Those two combined changed my life.

My Dr. suggested Cymbalta and I started on 30mg a day and now am currently taking 60mg a day. I am normally not depressed anymore but am not a zombie by any means. I don't get anxious like I used to. I also believe this drug helps with my diabetic nerve pain. I have gained weight taking this drug, which hasn't helped with my diabetic condition. I have also experienced horrific side effects from running out of this medication. I had nightmares, insomnia, terrible bouts of nausea, dizziness and I would wake up at night hearing my heart beating. I was terrified I was going to have a heart attack. When I got my meds again, I was okay. I have been taking this for almost two years and it scares me to think of running out. I really do believe I am addicted to it and I don't like that feeling. I hate taking medication but I was so depressed at the time, I welcomed any help. My Dr. seems to think I will be taking Cymbalta for a very long time.

I have self-control again.  Prior to Cymbalta I found myself filled with anxiety and worry about everything.  I felt like everything was out of control and I couldn't control myself in any aspect (eating, sleeping, worrying, spending).

I now, not only feel great but I feel I have control again.  I've slowly loosing weight by diet and exercise which before I couldn't make myself do.  

While I experienced mild side effect at the start those are now gone. 

I guess when I read the review like most things you see a split of about 50/50 on positive/negative.  

The main thing I did see consistently was the severe withdraws but after a discussion with my doctor she indicated that when I'm ready to stop we should slowly wean off to minimize withdrawals.

However, feeling this good - I never want to stop.  "

I had had panic attacks in the past, and started again with the first few doses of Cymbalta.  I kept thinking it would get better, but instead got worse, much worse.  I was also getting the brain ""zaps"", horrible insomnia, weight gain, and oddly enough, urine output was diminished.  I found I could barely function, was a hazard on the road, etc., etc.  Went back to the doc, who told me to stop, get back on Lexapro 10 mg q day, and let him know.  For about 4-5 days after stopping the meds, I was totally debilitated; couldn't think, was dizzy, having sweats, nausea, and a host of other problems.  Called him back and he told me to open the capsule and take just a few grains from the Cymbalta for a few days, or however long it would take to feel ""normal"" again.  I do feel better after even the first time doing that.  I certainly hope this works, as I'm truly tired of messing around with pills and would love to have my life back. I have always worked for physicians, so have some idea of what is going on, which is not to say I'm not sick and tired of all the turmoil."

There are some real horror stories on here.  I had a great Dr. managing my meds...I was very concerned about withdrawal side effects, so we took over 3 months to get me off it after I was ""done"" (I was on it for 1 yr after it had started working to make sure I did not relapse after coming off).  Don't rush!  If you rush, you get bad side effects.  I started at 60mg and went down 10mg every 2 weeks.  Near the end she had me open the 20mg capsule, dump about half the contents out and reclose capsule and take it.  Then I took about 1/4 capsule.  Then I went to 1/4 capsule every other day.  I started to get bad vertigo at one point, so she had me step back to last dosage and start to decrease again once no side effects were there.  She also warned me that during withdrawal you can get what appears to be depression symptoms back (e.g. moodiness, lack of patience, crying for no reason, etc).  I'm glad she did - otherwise I might have thought I needed to go back on it vs. it being a temporary thing while getting off the meds.  It took over 3 months, but the process was a smooth one and I feel terrific.  Also - remember that people tend to read and write reviews on meds when they're experience isn't that great.  Most of these reviews sound terrible - but they are not a balanced view of what the med can do for you.  Most of the people with no problems won't have a reason to take the time to come on here.  Be patient with it!  If you have lots of withdrawal side effects, talk to your Doc and slow the process down.  There's no reason you have to feel terrible through it all.  Cymbalta gave me my life back.  I am a better wife, mother and friend after being on it.  I would do it all over again if I had to."

I was given this drug for pain. (spinal injury, severe headaches, stiff, painful muscles) It worked for maybe 5 months, but I continued to take it in hopes that it would help. I decided to start weaning off in March of 2009, after being on it for 1 year. The withdrawal symptoms are unbelievable! Zaps throughout my body, like putting my fingers into a light socket, numbness, shakes, palpatations, sweating, nausea. It is now nearing the end of May and I am still experiencing the ZAPS, thankfully the other symptoms have subsided. The one thing I have noticed since being free of this drug, my last 1/8 of a dose taken April 28, is that I can think again, I can feel again, I can cry and laugh, I can function! AND IT FEELS GOOD!!! I don't fall asleep at the blink of an eye anymore. Now, looking back I see that I was in a zombie-like state, robotic, unable to have any emotions, control my appetite(major weight gain), think clearly or stay awake, always in a fog. I actually thought I had developed narcolepsy, I didn't, it was the cymbalta. The drug took over my whole life slowly, which made me unaware of what was being taken away from me. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. The five stars for ease of use is because it couldn't get any easier! Put a capsule in your mouth and swallow!

I could NOT take care of my children, could not responsibly drive a car, imposable to make clear decisions, thoughts of suicide which I have never experienced. In my consumer opinion there is NO WAY any good could come from this drug. The only thing I found this drug will do while taking it is detach you from all emotions and you become numb to everything around you. ""Zombie like"" if you will. The withdraw last well after the meds stop! I would not recommend to anyone. This is happening to may people everyday. Someone PLEASE take notice before it hurts more people. A counselor that I went to see due to the fact that I was feeling so confused and crazy advised me to go to a drug rehabilitation center for a few days to make sure I did not need any medical or mental help.

Only thing that I don't like is that if I forget to take it one day I get what my doctor calls ""brain zaps"". They are one second ""zaps"" that cause dizziness and tingling in my face, jaw, arms, hands and legs.  It's not painful just weird.  My doctor says it's completely normal.  Hope this helps someone!"

Checked with both the pharmacist and my doctor, who both said the dose wasn't high enough, as I had been started on the lowest dosage at first.  After a few days on the higher dose the anxiety has decreased somewhat, and panic attacks aren't as prevalent.  I do seem to have more energy and seem to ""care"" more, as to how tidy the house is, getting things done, etc.  I think in time the anxiety will lessen and I will again feel more in tune with life."

I was on Cymbalta for a total of 3 weeks 2 weeks at 30mg and 1 week of 60 mg. I had ablood test done after the first 2 weeks and my liver readings were 4-5 times what is normal. So the doctor immediately took me off the Cymbalta and all other meds & vitamins to let the liver heal. Will have a blood test in 3 weeks to see if everything is back to normal. I would not have known about the liver damage if I hadn't had the blood test for my scheduled physical. So if you are on this medicine I would highly recommend getting blood checks for your liver.

Scariest experience of my life.  Side effects included extreme involuntary muscular movement, loss of short-term memory,dry mouth, frequent need to urinate - followed by hesitation of bladder to release urine.  The side effects of this medication caused me to be hospitalized for 6 days with involuntary muscular tremors, as deemed by my rheumatologist.  Once my dr ordered that I no longer be given cymbalta, my involuntary muscular tremors ended within 48 hours.  Thank Heavens for my Rheumatologist who knows me, because the neurologists and psychologists in the hospital wanted to rule the movements as a conductive disorder and kept asking me if I had deep-seeded emotional trauma as a child.  After becoming angry at the allegations that this was 'in my head'.  I am blessed to be in the care of a rheumaologist who has knowledge of this medications side effects.  In retrospect, my family members now state that they saw warning signs of the side effects for about 2 weeks prior to the hospitalization... My recommendation, research prior to taking any medication!!! - Knowledge is Power!

Sometimes the cramping were so servere I want someone to put me out of my pain! I began to have blood spots forming under my skin. I would talk to my doctors about this problem. No one listened to me. I taken all I could take.... I STOPPED THIS MEDICATION. Two weeks after stopping all the symptoms stopped. No more cramping, no more blood spots under the skin. My doctor use to tell me to eat banans;drink water; but never did my doctors tell me that Cymbalta was causing this problem. Sometimes we need to sit back and take a hard look at our doctors. They are not always right and they do not always listen to us. I am a much happier person.....twisting-cramping and blood spots all came from this medication.

For me there were not really any side effects since I stopped being a smoker 3 mos before starting this med. Smoking from what I've experienced with other Anti-Ds can make side effects worse and then eventually they go away. But for short I did alright on this dose 20 mg. then the DR. raised it up to 60 mg. I felt ok not 100% better. still had some low-self esteem,little anxiety. Then after 3 mos it made me feel agitated, anxious, and feeling like everybody is the f-ing devil. Dr lowers it to 30 mg because I asked that it be lowered to see how that does. As a result, I still feel all the depression symptoms. Can't a f=-ing anti-depressant ever work!!! I am constantly changing my meds because after several mos they just don't work. I don't know what it is that I need. When I skip a day or 2. I feel GOOD! less stressed,worried and anxious. What the hell gives? Somebody told me in my group therapy that I may be getting too much of norepenephrine.HUH? Can a doctor tell me what and why these meds don't do thier jobs? I am stressed about these meds.!! I'm afraid of trying another one. I wish my dr. or someone could tell me what would be right for me.

I have been taking it for 2 months and I saw an improvement right away and it just keeps getting better. The only major side effect for me is the insomnia I experience every night. I only seem to get 3-4 hours of sleep a night. My doctor warned me about this and gave me some samples of Lunesta that work really well.  I will be taking that from now on before bed. Do not take Cymbalta before bed! It puts you in a 1/2 sleep 1/2 wake state with awful nightmares! Take first thing in the morning to avoid the dreaded dreams. Also, I do wake up damp from sweating but it isn't a real issue for me compared to what I was going through before. Hope this helps!!

Two and one half years ago I was injured at work. I had been off of work for about six months and was feeling very down, crying all of the time, very anxious about not being able to return to my work as a RN. My doctor put me on 30mg of Cymbalta once a day. I took it for a month, but really felt no effects until it was raised to 60mg once a day. It was like night and day for me. I felt so much better about myself and I wasn't crying all of the time. Instead of dwelling on what I couldn't do, I concentrated on what I could. I went back to school online while I was still unable to work and got my BBA with a concentration in healthcare. I am now working at a new job as a RN in a new youth mental health facitlity and working at getting my MBA. The only side effects that really bother me is the excessive sweating night and day and the weight gain. I can deal with those side effects because my outlook on life is so much better.

Although I experienced weight gain. My Dr has since lowered my dosage to 30 mg daily and I am having trouble sleeping, my anxiety is higher, and my Dr and I are discussing a possiblilty of changing my medication altogether.
I would also like to add that there was a period of time that I was without medication for about 12 days and it was horrible!! I experienced terrible withdrawl symptoms.  Insomnia, high anxiety, nausea, dizziness, extreme emotional distress and mood swings.  I do not ever recommend stopping medication without consulting your doctor and 'weaning' off of it. my situation was a bit different, I receive my meds through a mental health agency and they had a mix up in my orders. I couldn't afford to buy my own and they wouldn't call in to a local pharmacy. I was literally stuck.  My personal opionion? I don't especially recommend Cymbalta. That doesn't mean it's not right for you. That's for you and your Dr to decide."

And as the saying goes...If it ain't broke..don't fix it!
3188$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$4/18/2009 5:34:04 PM$Reviewer: Mitchy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have only been using Cymbalta for about 2 weeks.  I was previously taking Lexapro, which worked pretty well but I had still no energy or will to do anything.  My doctor weaned me off Lexapro for 5 days.  He did this by having me take 1/2 the dosage of Lexapro and 1/2 the dosage of Cymbalta that he wanted me to ultimately take.  It worked perfectly.  I now take 60 mg Cymbalta and no Lexapro (used to take 20mg) and I am feeling so much better already.  It is amazing!  I now have more energy and feel more positive.  The only problem that I do have is that it has made my insomnia worse.  I will discuss this with my doctor when I see him in 2 weeks.  I have various conditions including depression such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, mitral valve prolapse, hypothyroidism , generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia.  I am hopeful that Cymbalta will  continue to help these conditions improve.  Thank you so much!

Today was the first day I felt somewhat normal.  The first day I took it, I couldn't get off the couch.  Stomach was very upset and I felt like a balloon was blown up in my head. (I have had that every day so far) Severe insomnia with this drug, however I still feel energized the next day.  I do take naps during the day to compensate for the lack of sleep.  I began taking the drug at night/before bed, as my dr. recommended, but I would wake up and toss and turn all night.  Started to take it in the early afternoon.  We will see how that goes.  I only had one anxiety attack-Easter sunday at my boyfriend's family's house...so uncomfortable!!  Thank God for Xanex! I am apprehensive after reading all of the bad reviews Cymbalta received...but will continue until I ultimately make up my mind on my own.  I know it takes a week or two to adjust...good luck fellow review readers!

My doctor initially prescribed Zoloft, which I rook for 2.5 months last summer.  It did not help, and I had terrible side effects (including tremor and panic attacks).  Recently, she prescribed Cymbalta, which has been extremely effective for both the anxiety and depression.  I took 30 mg for two weeks, and experienced mild side effects for the first five days.  These included tremor, fatigue, and decreased appetite.  However, these soon went away and I felt the best I had in years!  Last week I began taking 60 mg a day (in the morning) and the side-effects returned to some extent.  However, I still feel good, and I highly recommend this drug.  I would suggest limiting caffeine intake though, especially if it is prescribed for anxiety.

There are some abdominal pain but with Tylenol it eases.  As I work on my feet all day, in a bakery, my mood has improved greatly and my work has not been this good in years.  This medicine may not be for everyone but so far it has worked for me.  The side effects of any drug can be bad and I ran out of this med for 1 week and experienced more pain than before so the doc made sure that I don't run out.  The price is high but thank God I have insurance for it.  Right now I can't even imagine not being on it.  the pain is managable for the first time in over ten years.  The best thing I have found.

Also gained six pounds in two months.  Started weaning off drug, 60 to 30mg per day, then per 36 hours, then 48 hours.

This is the strangest medication that I have ever experienced, but it is difficult to decide whether or not to stay on or get off because I do not think that the BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS. But, it is so nice not to have that CHRONIC SEVERE PAIN that I have had for years and is increasingly getting worse. I do not know what to do. This medication does not want me to get off of it. I guess I have to get off of it if all I do is sleep and have no life, don't know where I am half the time....Oh, and ""no"" I do not have any other disease. One would think so with all of these side effects. Anyone know how to wean off of this? One positive - It did help the pain for me for the first week. Everyone is different and if it helps you I am so happy for you because fibromyalgia (if it is chronic severe pain), as in my case,is a pain that is indescribable. I hope a good medication without so many side effects comes out soon! More of us need to speak up to our doctors, as it seems that many of the drug companies have not educated them about the medications. I have to call the pharmacist and take there time up Thanks."

Because of all this I have got major depression which sucks cause I have 4 kids as well and I have to try to stay positive around them even with all my back problems. I have tryed many anti-depresents Zolft, Lexapro ect.. I started Cymbalta 30 mg twice a day and that really didn't seem to do it and I didn't have any real side effects. After a month I was switched to 60 mg twice a day and I must say I am very impressed. It does actually work for nerve pain and major depression "" More Depression then nerve pain though"" and still has very little side effects like you have with alot of other depression medications. If Cymbalta doesn't seem to be working for you talk to your doctor about increasing the dose. He will know best considering your condition. Good Luck and don't give up hope!! Fighting depression can be hard but there are people out there who care. Just sometimes they can be hard to find. don't give up hope!!"

Decreased appetite and a slight increase in energy. My mood also seemed slightly elevated.  Four weeks at the 60mg dosage was torture!  I experienced daily diarrhea, extremely odorous flatulence. The smell of the gas was unlike anything I've EVER experienced.  I felt like I was farting out dead rats!  I also experienced nonstop nausea during the 4wks at 60mg.  I was really trying to give this medication a chance because I'm so desperate for pain relief. But I couldn't take it any longer. I quit cold turkey!

I started to feel better overall and was getting out of the house which is a big deal for me.  I was very active and outgoing, I worked full time and attended college when I was raped and this caused me to have the symptoms mentioned above.  After about 6 months on this medication I noticed that I felt no emotions what so ever.  I became irritable, felt like my head was in a fog and did not care about anything at all, I stopped taking care of myself and just slept all day and most of the night.  Then I started to think about wanting to die.  One night I became very suicidal.  Luckily I was talking to my mom and she recognized something was really wrong and kept her eye on me.  We decided that I should stop the medication and I weaned myself off.  That was very hard.  I suffered horrible side effects from discontinuing this medication, after a month of weaning off I still suffered side affects.  I have been off this medication since December 08 and my mom said it is like she has her daughter back and my fiance also said I am not so numb to life.  I did not enjoy this medication and I think people should consider other alternatives if they are possible.  This is a very strong medication with major side effects.  I have been taking Celexa and Trazodone(at bedtime to help me sleep) and I have been doing much better.  I was on Celexa in the past and I did really well on it.  I also take xanax for panic attacks, but I have found that I have not needed this medication as much.  Side effects going off this medication were very hard to endure.  I had migraines, dizziness, nausea, back pain, shocks going through my body, and nightmares. I am just glad I went off this medication when I did. I also have fibromyalgia and this medication did seem to help with those symptoms. Overall I do not recommend thi

The depression is not in total control but i think it would be but for the pain that i still have and will always have. i was ready to give it all up until he switched me. I was on Prozac for years before that. The expense is the only reason I would ever think of giving it up. For neuro pain it is truly wonderful. You aren't up, you aren't down, it just works.

I took Cymbalta for nerve pain for 2 months due to nerve impingement in my neck. It worked fair. I developed extreme shortness of breath and rapid heart beat(tachycardia) with irregular heart rate and ended up in the ER thinking I had a blood clot in my lungs.  That was negative. It was all due to Cymbalta side effects.  I have weaned off Cymbalta but now am miserable for the past 4 weeks with Serotonin withdrawal symptoms which has left me feeling extremely fatigued, short of breath with chest heaviness, and feeling very lightheaded.  As far as I am concerned, they should take this medication off the market.  It is evil! You can read more by googling ""Cymbalta and serotonin withdrawal"".  Eli Lilly, the drug manufacturer does not do a good job educating Dr's and the consumer on the extrememly negative and possibly fatal side effects of this medication.  If you do wean off it, do it very slowly over a period of months, not weeks and get some expert advice, and that may not be your Dr."

I'll admit, this doctor sucked as a psychiatrist--perhaps she just knew that nothing she could say would help me--but her somewhat-risky suggestion to start taking 60mg Cymbalta at (almost) 17. It is definitly worth the mild constipation and increased sweating (only at night in my sleep). "

I previously was on Effexor but went off of the Effexor when trying to get pregnant. I also tried Zoloft for a short time as well. I believe the Effexor worked the best for my condition, keeping my level of anxiety at bay, but was very difficult to ween off of. Zoloft didn't seem to relieve as much of the anxiety issues, but I would recommend it for slight levels of depression or anxiety. I have a supplement prescription for Klonapin taken as needed. When I was on the Effexor, I needed the Klonapin the least. Cymbalta works well, but I'm worried about the fact that it's a newer drug and not sure of the long-term effects of it. I'm also concerned that I will never be able to be completely off of one of these medications due to the severe withdrawl effects. I do know that being on Cymbalta helps me to feel ""normal"" again. I can function well without having the stress of the anxiety issues always troubling me. It has changed my life in the fact that I can be more social and enjoy even going to meetings at work without worrying about anxiety. This medication should be reviewed carefully with a doctor before starting treatment."

The Dr and I wanted to combine the treatment, if possible, and maybe take away one drug. I had a very bad reaction to Cymbalta, however. I stopped taking Effexor, per the Dr's order, and then after 48 hrs, began the Cymbalta @ 30mg per evening. After about 4-5 days, I hurt so much, I could not walk, sit, even move. My skin even hurt. I did not notice any swelling, but it felt as if all of my nerves were misfiring and at a very, very angry rate. I could not touch my body anywhere. Even my tush hurt to sit down, and then it hurt to get back up. It hurt to wash my face, and a particularly bad spot was was my occipital bones in the back of my head. If I made the mistake of letting anything touch that area, I almost passed out from the pain.
Unfortunately, this is not the drug for me. The Dr put me back on Effexor and we're still looking for something for the FMS.  "

I take Cymbalta daily at bedtime..it allows me to sleep more about 6-8hrs, rather than the 0-3 hrs I was getting in the past.
Also with my sleep improved, my mood improved, I wasn't as depressed *(I still required a different med for this issue)*, was able to exercise (walk & swim) with not feeling terribly stiff the next day.
Cymbalta also helps me better focus on my activities, daily work which involves Customer Service.

My doctor prescribed it for Fibromyalgia, Depression and Anxiety. After 5 years on Wellbutrin the effectiveness dimished drastically so I decided to switch. What a great change! I started on 30 mg for one week and am now on 60 mg. The pain and stiffness in my hands, neck, shoulders and back disappeared with the first dose! 90% of my pain is gone and I have more energy and feel a lot more positive and relaxed. I am not a grumpy, sore, exhausted mess anymore. There are some side effects I am experiencing such as headache (first few days), dizziness, constipation and waking up repeatedly in the early morning hours. My eyes were very dry the first few days and also when the dosage was increased but that has improved now. A positive side effect is that my appetite has decreased..a good thing because I was eating tons of empty emotional calories and gained 30 pounds in the last year. I do feel like my brain is a bit slow at times, especially for a couple hours after I wake up. But, I am back at the gym again and pain-free. I cannot remember having a day without pain since I was diagnosed with fibro 8 years ago. The side effects are starting to lessen and overall I am very happy with this medication. Try it!

I had the same dizzyness others felt when the dose was not taken at the exact 24 hour time but it took me a long time to determine that was the problem. So I convinced my doctor to switch me back. I asked if there were any ""withdrawals"" I should be aware of since I already knew about the dizzyness after missing ONE dose. He assured me there was not.
I am on day 5 of no Cymbalta (but I am taking my prozac) and I feel like I have been on a 4 day drunk and still VERY tipsy. Do some quick online searches for Cymbalta withdrawal and you'll find MANY who have the same difficult time getting off this stuff. I did not find it to be any more effective than prozac and rated it a 2 for ease of use since you have to be so very careful not to miss an HOUR much less a dosage! I hate this stuff and am desperate to be out of this withdrawal stage. Be careful with this one, especially if you feel you are one who can take this for a year.. get better and get off them."

I take 60mg once a day in the morning and I have just been given an add-on of BuSpar 10mg 2x daily to see if that can help relieve some of the anxiety I still get.  I've heard Cymbalta works well with BuSpar...but I guess I'll find out.  As far as side-effects go, I haven't noticed much of anything aside from a slight decrease in appetite and some mild constipation at first, but I have since adjusted to the medicine and that has gone away.  I'm not so sure if Cymbalta's claims for anxiety relief are too accurate, but it is effective on major depression.

I'm switching it today and going to take it in the morning so hopefully the tierd feeling will happen at bedtime. I do feel detatched as in other comments and sometimes emotionless, but it is better than being depressed or anxious.

However it started to lose it's effectiveness so the doc upped the dose. Other side-effects I couldn't deal with were insomnia, low sex drive, and inability to have an orgasm. Also if I forgot to take it one day and remembered the next I would get what I call ""the zaps"" where I sincerely felt aware of every electrical impulse in my brain which drove me nuts. It was like having to get used to it all over again. Overall it affected me pretty much the same as every other SSRI and I refuse to take any of them without something like Ativan to counteract the insomnia and ""the zaps"". Today I have given up on all the SSRI's. I would rather have a good sex life. Still I have to keep filling the scripts or else the doc won't prescribe Ativan. Why I do not know. Seems pretty stupid.

Every morning about an hour after I take it, I have a headache above my eyes, behind my forehead. I only get intermittent sleep at night. I have fibromyalgia and take pain meds for that, too. How can I get rid of the headaches? I don't normally have them and you're not supposed to take aspirin or ibuprofen with this.

So far I have been happy with the results.  The only downside are the night sweats and ringing in the ears.  Possible side effects warned of ringing in the ears, but night sweats?  Overall, my mood has greatly improved, energy level is much higher and I am finally back to enjoying life again.
3381$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$2/11/2009 10:26:34 PM$Reviewer: galinda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$"I have been taking Cymbalta (60 mg) since November 25, 2008 - 10 weeks. I felt immediate (approx 3-4 days) relief from my depression and anxiety (I tried 2 other antidepressants in September and October). I was surprized to find that I also lost the desire to overeat or self medicate.

I have returned to work full time (the depression started November of 05 - I worked on and off until July 07, then I was off work for 6 months). I am able to focus more (I could barely write a check before). I am not nearly as clear as I was before the depression but I can function for the first time in several years.

There have been some disturbing side effects - very blurry vision, shortness of breath, and rather scary dizziness. I also feel rather detached - or perhaps it is just that I am not catastrophizing so much - I do not feel the need to analyze absolutely everything.

These side effects scare me - I resorted to meds as I HAD to go back to work or I would have been homeless. I have also begun to have a tic (blinking my eyes) - one I had when I tried prozac years (16) ago (the last time I took antidepressants). 

Would I rather not take this medicine? Yes. Did it save me at a critical point? Absolutely."

My loved ones say it has made a definite difference for the better. I am not sure about the pain or the depression. However if people I trust tell me I do not seem depressed, then I believe it has been effective. As far as side effects some of these could be due to other medicines I take or could be caused by the Cymbalta. They are dry mouth,erectile dysfunction,constipation and increased perspiration. All are bothersome and some I take additional medication for.

3386$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$2/11/2009 10:13:24 AM$Reviewer: Beth, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been taking 30mg of Cymbalta every night for several months, with little to no side effects.  There have been times when I forgot to take my pill at night, and I took it the next night, with no problems.  Now that I'm in a relationship, I can comment that I've experienced no sexual side effects.  I have no trouble physically responding, or reaching a climax, which goes against what others have written here.  My emotions are not dulled; I experience a range, without feeling stuck in neutral.  Occasionally, I get a touch of constipation, but nothing a little mineral oil or castor oil won't fix.  And I am diligent about not taking aspirin or ibuprofen, or using antacids, since they interact badly with the Cymbalta.  I haven't had a cold yet, and I've read that most cold/cough remedies are off-limits for Cymbalta users, so I've got to figure out what I can take, instead.  Overall, I'm very happy with my experiences with Cymbalta, and though there are many negative reports about it, I believe it can and does work for some people!

When I initially began taking it I felt that there was some help with the severe pain in hand joints and knees but as the pain mgt dr. precribed a higher dosage to see if that would help the consistancy .  I began to have severe pain down my legs,in my hips and in my ankles and feet .  The pain in my ankles and feet was excruciating and eventually I was unable to walk at all without a brace on my ankles and my hands were so painful and swollen it felt terrible even when taking morphine.  I believe that it was effecting fluid retention severely and weight gain.  I am now having to wean myself of the medicine and that must be done slowly and carefully because it may cause adverse affects if taken off to quickly.

I was a prisoner of my mind for about 30 years. I have also taken Prozac everyday for mild depression for about 20 years. When starting to fall asleep I do experience involuntary body jerks sometimes and, I do get an electric shock feeling in my tongue followed by a metalic taste occasionally. The tongue zaps will wake me up from a deep sleep. I never had the body jerks or electric tongue zaps prior to taking the Cymbalta. BUT I can now leave my neighborhood!!! Thank goodness these side effects for me are not severe enough for me to stop taking the drug. I am no longer a prisoner of my own mind. I did have to work on my anticipatory anxiety but now it is mild since I have had so many positive experiences. The cymbalta so far has not allowed my anxiety to escalate to a full blown anxiety attack. I do take Ativan occasionally to help me get over major anticipatory anxiety. But now I rarely need to take the Ativan anymore.  The impossible for me is now possible thank GOD!!!! I also changed to a psychiatrist who is a pharmacologist. He's the one that put me on the Cymbalta. Don't give up there's a correct drug and dosage for you out there.

I am 45 y.o. R.N. and it has been a shock how much chronic pain can upset your whole nervous system.  I have tried to take Cymbalta several times but I had nausea, upset stomach and nightmares so bad I stopped.

I would like to try Cymbalta again as I know it is a newer generation of Depression medicine.
But so far I have read alot about weight gain and would suggest people to stay away from simple Carbs, watch the amount of complex carbs and eat more high grain breads, more veggies and only your palm size of meat/chicken etc 3 times per day.

If you expierence bad side effects report it to the FDA MEDWATCH.COM. It won't surprise me if this drug is taken off the market and lawsuits follow.

My doctor got me the med for free, and on only 30 mg. once a day in the morning, I am starting to be ME again! In the one week I have been on cymbalta, I have taken 2 tests for my college courses, and got an 87 and a 100! I am not as sleepy and lethargic as I was, and NO weight gain! First day only was a bit rocky-felt a bit speedy and cloudy, but I decided to go with taking it early a.m and with food, and I am so very happy! I know people don't believe in wonder drugs, but for me, that is exactly what cymbalta is-a wonder drug. You never know HOW depressed you are until something like cymbalta comes along and lifts that heavy, dark, seemingly endless curtain of despair and hopelessness! Please, if you are depressed, try it! I can only hope and pray it will work as well for you as it has for me! I LOVE it!

However, within 2 days of stopping the drug I started having severe withdraw symptoms (panic attacks, insomnia, paranoia, extreme anger, feelings of being electrocuted every few seconds!, and suicidal ideation).  My psychiatrist is now trying to force me back on it or she will not continue seeing me as a patient.  After going off of it for 5 weeks, I reluctantly went back on 30 mg for one week but she wants me on 60mg.  I have taken as much as 120mg while hospitalized but I was a zombie.  The decision of going back on Cymbalta or not is causing more suicidal thoughts/plans.  I thought this drug was supposed to help.  If I end up back in the hospital they will just force it into me as they did before.

I personally do not take Cymbalta but a close family friend does.  This is effective when being used, and I'm pretty sure it is pretty easy for him to use. I want to say that I have never been so sared of this man in all my life until just a week or so ago.  He ran out of his pills and it was a Sunday so the pharmacy wasnt open. No words can describe what this drug has done. I went over to their house to help with the draft horses.  It all started when the harnesses somehow got switched, and thats when it all started.  He was screaming about everything, cussing constantly and I finally understood waht his wife has described to be before.  I was so scared, and I was with him alone in the barn plus 2 horses scared to death! He is ""addicted"" to it and can never come off of it ever.  If he did he would probably kill sombody, and Im dead serious about that.  This drug made him like this, I dead set on that!  He was never like this before he was put on this.  I hope and pray to God that nobody ever has to go through the things I have been through. I hope the makers of Cymbalta are happy about what they have done to him and all who care about him."

I had already been treated for depression, which I'm starting to realize is more ANXIETY with some situational depression. I also have ADD.
This medication was miraculous for me at the time. I did go off Strattera, which I was taking for the ADD, because I wanted to make sure I wasn't overmedicating, and for similar things.
I never suffered any side effects, and had ceased taking Prozac and other medications due to their sexual side effects.
HOWEVER, if/when I would miss a dose, I would feel a ""sizzle""/ electrical impulse in my brain/twanging of a rubber band in my head. I started being more diligent about not missing doses, and then started feeling them when I hadn't missed a dose! My doctor and I started the weaning process of 90mg/once per day, to 60mg/once per day for about a week, then 30mg/once per day for about a week. I even elongated this time frame as a precaution. I barely noticed any withdrawal until I was no longer taking the medication, and it was clearing from my system. The sizzle/twanging in my head became a nightmare for me. I thought I was losing my mind, and was crying all the time. 
The alternative actions were to take the meds every other day for a week or so, or to take a small dose of prozac for about a few days, then every other day for another few days... I chose the Prozac treatment for several days.
This is NOT a medical promotion to do this on your own!!!! Please talk to your doctor before going off your medication. If I had not been talking to my doctor, I probably would have checked myself into the hospital!
Overall, Cymbalta worked for me. I just didn't think it was a good idea to go to a higher dose, and wanted to find another medication to combat the ANXIETY that had become more apparent as the cause, as opposed to a symptom of my PTSD/depression.
I hope this helps."

I felt terrible with it and I felt terrible when I went off of it. I have since consulted my doctor and replaced it with Elavil, and I have experienced amazing and immediate positive results.

See if this medication will be right for your condition. I personally cannot say that I found any positive results from Cymbalta. My condition was not improved and my general mood due to muscle and joint pain made me more irritable and decreased my overall quality of life. Don't wait, talk to your doctor.

It has worked wonderfully on lessening my pain & has helped my depression by 60% or better. However, my sexual drive has been greatly affected negatively & I seem to sleep approximately 15 to 17 hours a day & night combined.
My appetite is almost gone completely, which isn't all bad because I need to lose 100 pounds, but I'm not eating a very well balanced diet now because nothing sounds good to eat! I have lost 5 pounds in 1 month. The biggest problem is that all the sleeping I do takes up so much time that I use to spend doing nothing. But at least I feel rested when I get up!"

It decreased my sexual desire, put me in a dull state of mind, and made me very angry and suicidal.  When I figured it out, I was to taper down the Cymbalt over a 2 week period, then go o Prozac.  The 2 week period was hell. I experienced ""alcohol"" type DT's for 3 days, and almost every day after that.  It's been 2 weeks, I am extremely sick, vomitting, etc.  Plus, my mood is worse, depressed, crying, hate myself, thought of hurting myself, hate my life.

I have been on every anti-depressant imaginable.  It seems nothing works for me and my M.D. told me that Cymbalta not only works on the serotonin but also the norepromine.  
I guess I will just have to wait and see as I feel Cymbalta is my last hope.  Yeah, I'm, scared that it won't work.  I also suffer from panic/anxiety attacks.  My doctor(psychiatrist)also has me on Clonazepam, Lithium, Trazadone, and Concerta.
I have been on Clonzapam so long I can no longer feel the effects of it but it does stop the panic attacts from coming..thank God!!  I still have the anxiety that can be very overwhelming at times.
I'm on Lithium to help the anti-depressant more effectively.  No, I'm not bi-polar.  I'm on Trazadone for sleep.  I do NOT like the way it makes me feel such as a racing heart and nervousness.  But it does put me to sleep.  Hate it though!!  I'm on Concerta since I have just been diagnosed with adult ADD.  I know there's no magic cure but I at least need a reprieve from the debilitating depression and anxiety.  I feel like a guinea pig with all the medications I've been given.   "

I gained 35lbs+ while taking this medication.  The anxious feeling was increased while on this medication.  I finally went to a different doctor who actually listened to my complaints and agreed to help me wean myself off of it.  BEWARE!!!  The withdrawal symptoms are absolutely horrible.  It has been 2 months since I started the process of getting of the medicine.  There is a horribly scary feeling called ""brain zaps.""  Basically, the neurotransmitters in your brain are fighting to find the Cymbalta it's so used to having...the result is that you feel incredibly dizzy and panicked.  The ""zaps"" occurred almost every minute.  The withdrawal symptoms were so bad.....I found myself relating to how drug addicts feel when they are ""coming down.""  Please talk with your doctor about the possible withdrawal symptoms.  Check out blogs of other people who have gone through the withdrawal.  Some day....the drug company may face a lawsuit.  "

I take it to control the major depression associated with my bipolar disorder. I also take Depakote, Buspar, and just started on Abilify. The Cymbalta really helped with the depression and anxiety. I no longer have the severe panic attacks, and the depression greatly improved. Only problem is that I gained 25 pounds in 6 months and developed hypothyroid. However, given how I feel when I'm not taking the Cymbalta, I'll take the extra weight and thyroid medicine.

I have been treated for depression for 7 years and have tried over 5 medications during that time.  I was on prozac for a long time, until the Prozac Poop-out hit and it no longer worked.  One of the frustrating things about depression and the way our bodies metabolize the medications is that the medication can stop working at any time & not all medications work on all people.  Some of the problems that people listed below, I experience on other drugs.  For me Cymbalta is my miracle drug, keeping me on an even keel with very few depressive episodes, and even helping with my peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) in my feet that I acquired from a chemo drug.  I am definately more ""ME"" on it.  No drug will work for all people or even forever.  If it doesn't work for you, be persistant in looking for alternatives.  Work with a psychiatrist who knows all the medications/combinations available.  Don't take ""NO"" for an answer - only you know how you feel and only you will know when you have found the right drug.  Be your own health advocate or find someone to be one for you!  Best wishes to all for whom this doesn't work - keep pushing for the right drug - from someone who WILL BE on antidepresants for life!  (and not ashamed of it!) "

During the holidays, there were several occasions in which I couldn't take my nightly dose until much later than normal, and I still felt fine.  I didn't get nauseated, like I did in the beginning.  Also, I've noticed that it doesn't make me sleepy about an hour and a half later, like it used to.  The constipation isn't an issue anymore, either.  I guess I had to get used to it.  Anyway, I'm confident in giving it a 5-star rating in all the categories above.  I have noticed that I pee more, now, but that may or may not be connected to the medication.  I just have to be diligent in remembering to stay away from aspirin and ibuprofen.  I've switched to Tylenol, for the rare instances that I have a headache now.  Things are good; the Holiday season didn't depress me, or even make me sad, like it usually has.  At this point, I'm really grateful for Cymbalta.

Shortly after starting it, I started having major panic attacks, something I had never had before. Then dizziness, heart palpitations, high blood pressure. My doctor started to ween me off, and the side affects of that were completely aweful. The nausea and dizziness were so bad I couldn't even get off the couch, the panic attacks were extreme.  I ended up taking a bottle of Xanax to try to alleviate the side affects. It was aweful, not something I would do normally. This drug is evil. EVIL!
Now I am on a cocktail of meds, doing well, but I fear that I will never be able to stop taking an antidepressant or antianxiety meds ever again, and I feel it is due to what Cymbalta did to me. 
I wrote Eli Lilly and told them what happened to me, no response, they didn't care. All they want is the money.

Stay away from this drug. After what happened to me, I started reading up on Cymbalta, a totally healthy woman, with no history of mental issues, commited suicide while taking Cymbalta during one of their trials. The company still has no explanation for it.

Stay away from this drug!!"

For me it was a lifesaver. I have suffered from severe depression all of my life, later diagnosed with bi-polar but with my depression I suffered from a lot of pain due to it. Cymbalta has alleviated most if not all of those symptoms most days, all other anti depressants just were not strong enough. I have not had any side effects except dependancy which i would also warn that this is not for seasonal or situational depression, you should plan on being on cymbalta for the long haul.

So, as it was a holiday, I called my doctor's office, and they said to stop taking it IMMEDIATELY...I am really disappointed, as I was finally in a good mood from not being in so much burning pain, but an allergic reaction is potentially life threatening....

My Dr. prescribe it due to depression.  I couldn't sleep at night and couldn't stay awake during the day.  On the weekends I slept all day.  I was in general unhappy.  It worked wonders in the beginning, but not so much so now.  I have had bouts of insomia, night sweats and gained weight over the time period I have been taking it.  In the beginning I would miss a dose an no big deal, just take it the next day.  It would take at least 3 days for the withdrawals to take effect. But I would immediately go back into depression.  Now, if I miss a dosage within a couple of hours I start to get sick to my stomach and the headache begins. I am very irritable and can't seem to cope with anything at all. If you speak to me I want to bite you head off and it gets worse as the day goes on.  I missed two dosages over the Christmas holiday, and am still feeling the effects.  I wouldn't recommend this medicine sole based on the withdrawals.  It's addictive, and makes things worse than they where before when you try to stop taking it.

A few days later I began to feel extremely tired and eventually passed out while going to the bathroom.

Very mild dry mouth, freaked out my teen's with dialated pupils for two days, some constipation and upset stomach until I learned to drink more.  I also crave salt and have to remember to drink early in the day so I don't wake up at night.  No sex drive, and felt like a heart attack when I took an herbal with tryptophan in it.  I recommend watching for drug interactions closely, and increasing your fluid and fiber levels.  Headaches could be from dehydration...which many Americans suffer from without knowing!  Water, not pop may just cure those headaches and the fuzzy thinking folks..... Frankly, I think it is a wonder drug, but not for those ignorant of drug interactions.

I'm impressed with the speed with which it started working, as well as the scope of the improvements.  I feel decent, again, and I don't get so agitated at the irritations of my job.  My doctor started me on 30mg doses, to make sure I could take the drug successfully.  He wrote me a script, but it's for 60mg capsules. I've read so many scary things about this medication, that I'm afraid to take more than the 30mg's that I need.  So, I've been opening the capsules(!) and dividing the beads/pellets in half, and taking half each night, and saving the other for the next night.  As ridiculous as it sounds, it's working. When I go back for a checkup, I'm asking for a new script for the 30mg capsules, so I won't have to tamper with my medication, just to take the right amount.  That makes me wonder if some of the folks who are experiencing all sorts of extreme physical responses are being over-dosed by their doctors?  I get the impression that this drug is very strong, so it makes sense that too much would cause huge problems...?  I have also noticed that the dry mouth I experienced at first has dissipated, as has the constipation.  The only real side effect for me is sleepiness, which is why I take it at night. (I'm single, so I don't care if there are sexual side effects.)  Overall, I'm glad that Cymbalta is working so well for me.  It's been a God-send, as I was at my limit, before.  I was to the point of offing myself, before, just to escape the desolation of hating my life and myself.  So, I'm thankful for Cymbalta's effectiveness, as I feel like a regular person, now.  I don't know what I'll do, if it stops working.

I have lidocain patches, some other type of patch,neurotin 900mg daily, skelaxin 800mg daily, and 4 vicodin a day.  I feel like a drug addict. I forget where I put things, to do things, have no desire to deal with anything.  I am concerned that with these reviews that I am not going to see the results that i want and will have a heck of a time getting off of it. For me the cost is not an issue as workers comp is paying for all of it.  My injury was 2 years ago and I have had the same amount of pain for the past 2 years.  Without the drugs I would not be able to work.

I have found an alternative anti-depressant on line called PROTAZEN. It has amino acids, herbs, and Sam-e. No St. Johns Wort. It helps restore the neurotransmitters in your brain and help you feel calmer. In just two weeks I feel more hopeful, comfortable and less depressed. I can't wait to see how it works in a month. This is the first testimonial I have given for anything, I get nothing for writing this, just to help people find the relief I was looking for. I suffered needlessly for years and I hope I can shorten that time for others. Check it out for yourselves, www.protazen.com.

Initially it was a God send. The effectiveness has lessend gradually in the past few monts. My greatest concern with it's use is that once or if you miss a dose, you seem very lightheaded and disoriented, especially if longer than 24 hours. My recommendation would be if you have to take it, please don't ever forget to and keep additional dose's in car, work, purse, pocket wherever, etc..,because it is a horrible and frightening experiece that you don't want to have if you're already anxious and/or depressed.

I was in a fog and did not even realize it.  I could not tell that it helped with any body aches.  I went off of it a little over a year ago and boy, it was rough coming off of it!  I was suicidal and homicidal for weeks.  I gradually lowered my dose from I believe 60 to 40 to 20 and then off over four months.  I tried to come off it faster in the beginning and the doctor raised my dose back up due to side effects of coming off too fast for my body.  If you are thinking about taking Cymbalta, I would suggest you try other options first.  There are plenty of medicines that can give the same benefits without the side effects when coming off the drug.

I liked it quite a bit.  I still had emotions, but felt like I was in control of those emotions.  When I figured out that it was Cymbalta that zapped my libido, I wanted to get off of it and try something else.  I was on 60mg, 1x/day.  I was tapered to 30mg, 1x/day for one week, and then nothing.  *** BEWARE *** if you are going OFF of Cymbalta.  The withdrawl symptoms are horrifying.  I had terrible depression and anxiety, MUCH worse than before I started Cymbalta.  Tingling in the fingers, brain zaps, crazy mood swings, seeing things out of the corner of my eyes, and more. The withdrawl symptoms (I've been told by my GP) can last up to 6 weeks as it clears out of your system.  I just passed week 3.  The first week is the worst.  Please prepare yourself by reading up on it and talking with your doc afterward.  Some in the medical profession are unaware of the withdrawl from this drug.  Make yourself aware first, make your family aware and prepare yourself (you certainly may need to take time off work).  I hope this helps for anyone considering going off of Cymbalta.  It doesn't effect everyone this way, but for many it does. This drug helped me when I needed it, but in hindsight I wouldn't do it again.  THAT is how bad the withdrawl has been.

In the beginning it helped a lot, and I was ecstatic. I was painfree after years of being achy and sore. The first two weeks I felt quite nauseous but that went away. However, the effect seems to have worn off as well. It just makes me so tired that I fall asleep driving to work, and I need Adderall XR (20mg) to keep me alert and functioning. In the afternoon I need a Xanax to take away the anxiety caused by the Adderall. I think that is pretty screwed up. I never used to take pills, and now I feel like a junkie... I am not sure what to do. My doctor said I should ADD (!) Lyrica but I declined and told him that I felt drugged-up enough. I wonder if pain medication (NSAIDs) and sleep aids as needed might be better in the long run. I also heard terrible stories about weaning off Cymbalta...

3581$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/10/2008 12:03:03 PM$Reviewer: anon., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$I have dealt with depression and anxiety on and off for the past few years.  I recently had been off antidepressants for a year, but believe that my depression is more seasonal, so my health care provider suggested Cymbalta during the winter months.  I took it for about a week.  At first, I was severly sick to my stomach, but that did pass.  In one week, my ability to have an orgasm stopped.  It was literally like a light switch being turned off.  I went off of the Cymabalta two weeks ago, because the sexual side effects were so prominent.  Since stopping the Cymabalta, I have had severe dizziness and headaches (I was only taking 30 mg).  This is probably the worst antidepressant I have been on, second only to Zoloft, which did not do a thing.  It is too bad that these antidepressants take away a person's sexual desire. I wonder if the drug companies are working on fixing that significant problem.

I recently tapered off the med, but am having withdrawal symptoms even after 11 days of being off the med.  I had to taper to 30 mg a day for a month, then 30 mg every other day for a few weeks, then 30 mg every third day for a few weeks, then every fourth day for a few weeks.  The first time I tried to stop after 30 mg every other day for a week, I had headaches and lightheadedness.  Since stopping, I have lightheadedness off and on throughout the day, along with what feels like ""brain zaps.""  Some days I don't have any energy to do anything.  Other days are okay.

I am overweight and I am now going to the doctor to find out alternatives.  I did lose all my sex drive too.  But I don't cry and I am not moody unless I take antibiotics.  I recommend it to someone who cries for no reason to get through it!  I responded well to Prozac but it quit working and had to increase it.  Then tried Wellbutron and it worked well on my sex drive, but it upset my stomach.  Lexapro was AWESOME but would quit after 3 months.  Effexor did nothing for me.  I think I will go back to Lexapro.

Started out with 30 mg...felt like I was mad at the world even had a few words with others at work. After increasing my dose to 60 MG (30 MG twice a day) I'm feeling good in the depression area, but have bouts of IBS and dry mouth...also have gained about 20 pounds. I've been on and off of depression medication for over 20 years. I like to go off of meds from time to time to see if I can handle life. I'm wondering if I should go off of it, but after reading about withdrawal I'm nervous. I will wait until this spring before I decide to work with my doctor to get off of it. I also have experenced being light headed, dizzy and stomach upset when I miss a dose. I don't think I would have started this medication if I would have known about it's additive nature.
3595$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/4/2008 2:44:20 PM$Reviewer: Beth, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$4$"One thing I've noticed, using Cymbalta, is that it clears the depressive thoughts and negative mentality, so that I can realize and evaluate things in my life that aren't working.  For example, I hate my job.  I now realize that hating my job contributes a great deal toward the depression and negative outlook that descends over me, when the depression gets bad.  So, is hating my job (since it takes up a huge part of my life) causing most of the depression?  And, if I had a good, great-paying job, would I still get depressed and want to die?  I can't remember being caught up in severe depression the few times I've ever had jobs I loved.  At least now, using Cymbalta, I can take an evaluative look at my life, instead of just wanting to die, in order to stop feeling horrible.  Taking the drug clears my outlook enough to help me see that I need to make some changes.  Cymbalta helps me feel more able to move forward with my life, and gives me the strength to work on positive change.  The depression episodes tend to play mind games with me.  During them, it feels like everything is hopeless, and I'm too worn down and tired to fight any longer.  Cymbalta is helping me see that's not really the truth about my reality.  Overall, I guess it's worth risking the potentially dangerous side effects and/or withdrawal effects of this drug.  I'm thankful to feel better about my situation and my life.  This is the closest to normal I've felt, other than the first little while I was on Prozac.  I've never been a ""happy"" person, but at least Cymbalta helps me feel OK about it."

The brain zaps from before stopped immediately.  I sleep better.  I do get dry mouth now, and constipation is now a big concern.  But I've felt much better, from the start.  I've found that when I take the 30mg capsule with food, it doesn't make me feel nauseous.  I take it at night, because it does make me sleepy about an hour or so later. I don't smoke or drink, which interacts with the medication, and I can't take ibuprofen or aspirin.  Overall, I've been pleasantly surprised with my results, especially considering the alarming reports others have posted about their experiences with Cymbalta.  I'm glad I have insurance, so I get it with a $25 co-pay, as it costs $150 full-retail.  So far, I can say that this drug gives me the kind of great results that Prozac did, the first several years that I took it.  I'm happy with the 30mg dose, so I'm not going to increase to 60mg, which is the standard dose.  I hope I don't develop a tolerance to it, over time.  I'll post again later on, from time to time, to monitor my experiences with Cymbalta."

I experanced extreme dryness in my eyes,nose and throat to the point I had to open my eyes with my fingers every morning because my eye lids were stuck to my eyes and my throat was so dry I could hardly talk. None of my three doctors knew why and were about to do a biopsy to test for sjogrens. I took myself off of cymbalta and was pretty miserable for about ten days. Now I have extreme pain in my hands and feet again that seem to be spreading to my legs and arms. But almost all of the dryness is gone. Can't help but wonder if the cymbalta was drying out my eyes, nose and throat that bad, what was it was doing to my lungs,kidneys,etc.
Trying to take Lyrica now, but the side effects are so bad I can't take enough to do any good. Hope someone comes up with a wonder drug for neuropathy pain soon. Good luck to you all."

Tried many medications last 8 years, the higher the dose the more I wanted to die.  Higher doses are not always better!!!  When they increased to 60 mg I had same trouble.  I am staying on 30 for now.  Helps with joint pain( arthritis)a lot but if I had neuropothy I would be taking Lyrica, that is the drug for MS and neuro pain.  I like most can't sleep but I couldn't sleep before the drug.  Take Zanax and Atarax (antihistimine) at night.  Works better then All 7 RX sleep drugs and is much cheeper.  Big problem with cymbalta is I gained 50lbs.  However I have to be fair I don't know if it is the cylmbalta or the 9th blood pressure drug they have put me on!Before the antidepressents and BP drugs weight was OK.  Can't live with them and can't live with out them!
My son has a severe brain injury and it wasn't until they put him on lyrica that he started improving.  No more morphine, ativan, Vicodin.  Also took him off 230mg of Baclofen.  For nervepain try Lyrica!"

I am now being titrated to 60 mg TWO times a day, so we will see how that does.  My main reason for being here is to check on side effects of the drug since I seem to want to sleep all the time now.

However, I started developing some neurological concerns and was told to wean myself off of this medication.When I started noticing these concerns, I spent almost $6000 in medical bills to find out this was the culprit. I thought I was going to die from all the Neuro side effects.   I started taking 60mg a few years ago once per day and am now in Day 7 of 30mg and I must tell you this is not my ""cup of tea"".  The withdrawal symptoms are unbelievable.  I have felt like I am ""out of touch with society"".  The  withdrawal symptoms have included: crying spells, extreme fatigue, body aches, chills, nausea, vertigo, gait issues, headaches, skin problems (sores), memory loss, nerve pain, lack of energy, depression, no appetite, can NOT drive due to feeling off balance, trouble sleeping at night (waking up frequently) I must say, I will NEVER take this medication again once I get off of it. I have NEVER felt like this before.  I just know that once I get completely off of this medication, I will definately read ALL the fine print from other anti-depression, bi-polar medications again.

I woke up at least 5x an hour every night.  Dr. gave me a number of different sleep meds to counteract it, but they didn't help.  On 60mg Cymbalta, all of a sudden I could sleep through the night for the first time in years!  Even before Lexapro I think the depression was causing night waking.  Pros: Cymbalta has worked for my depression and anxiety.  Also, the sexual side effects (no sex drive, no orgasms) that I had with Lexapro disappeared!  Cons: I have been on it for 5 months now and have bouts of dizziness/vertigo when I turn my head too fast, as well as constipation.  I've also developed on and off stomach pain in my upper abdomen and am not sure if it's from the medicine itself or if it's related to the constipation.  I'm definitely better off with it, so I'm tolerating the side effects.  However, I have to say I'm scared of the day I come off it - there are some very scary withdrawal stories on this site.

I missed a couple of days and it was a very bad experience. 

Side effects: A few really bad headaches, The oddest one being acne. I am 45 and I am getting acne for the first time in my life? Some stomache pain. For the most part the side effects fade, and hopefully will continue to do so? 

I have tried many different types of anti-depressents, and this one seems to work. But it has only been 2 months which is usually around the time most of my meds start to wear off and I have to search for something new? So time will tell?"

I was hospitalized with a Staph-MRSA infection and at the same time my feet and legs swelled up 10 times their normal size.  After BUMEX IV's for 5 days swelling was gone but developed pain in the feet due to nerve damage.  I had hoped the Cymbalta would have completely masked the pain but at least it lessens the pain so that I can walk normally.

I went back into the Dr this past summer as I was tired of being tired all of the time. My body ached constantly and I took ibuprofen 2 to 3 times a day.  I had no desire to do anything, go anywhere or socialize.  My Dr started me on Cymbalta. After the first 2 weeks, I realized I was not popping ibuprofen all of the time, my energy level was back up and I started to enjoy life again.  A few months went by and I started feeling like I was going backwards.  I called my Dr and made another appointment.  She increased my dosage.  Withing a week, I was feeling great again.  I can honestly say this drug has worked for me.  While it may not work for others, please remember it is very important to see your Dr every few months to review your medication as somethng may work better for you or you may just need an adjustment in your dosage.

It took me going to an internal medicine doctor to get some answers. Now, at 33, I have fibromyalgia. I totally believe it is real, and quite painful. I have been taking Cymbalta for 5 weeks now. I actually sleep all night without waking up in pain, I get up on time in the mornings without feeling exhausted(I use to be chronically late to work), and I have more energy. I did have a few of the side effects at first, mainly the dry mouth and upset stomach, but they have diminished. I do have a side effect that I have not read about; I get a tightness in my throat, almost as if I need to swallow something but there is nothing to swallow. It's a very strang feeling.

It has now been one month since I took the last pill.The nausia,dizziness,stomach gas have still not completely gone.This is the worse medication I have ever experienced.Take with extreme precaution if perscribed, and discuss this with physicians before embarking on a nightmare that could possibly control your life for a minimum of two months.

I have taken Cymbalta, Effexor XR, Paxil, and Prozac.  I was put on Cymbalta because the Effexor XR had become ineffective at controlling the panic.  After being on Cymbalta for about a month, I began getting worse and worse.  I would sit on the couch and not move, or care about anything.  I decided I had to get off the medication (for fear I was going to hurt myself) and was advised to wean off slowly.  Over a four week period I gradually weaned myself off the medication.  This was the worst four weeks of my (and my families life).  The withdrawl from this medication is not easy.  I could hear myself blinking. I could hear the blood running through my veins.  I was so nauseous that I could barely eat, shower, or take care of my daughter.  I couldn't work, or drive.

However,  the side effects were NOT worth it. Unfortunately the side effects that I had were terrible. EXTREME sweating, high weight gain( which causes more depression), body aches, etc.  The worse being the erythema multiforme, sores on my body that were terrible. Extremely sensitive to touch and would not heal. This is a rare side effect and took much investigating to discover what I had and why. I am still trying to get a doctor to help me get rid of these sores. The medicine has lots of side effects while you are coimng off of it also.  Go to Cymbalta.com and read ALL the side effects before you try this medicine. Read the posts and BELIEVE these people.

Huge mistake! The Zoloft really kept his anxiety at bay, Cymbalta made it worse.  He also got very depressed, something he never had a problem with before. He even had a few episodes so bad I would not leave him alone. After 1 month on Cymbalta he quit and went back on the Zoloft. So far there has been no bad effects of quitting the drug as some had reported. And after 1 week back on the Zoloft he is slowly getting back to his old self again! Other more weird side effects he had was constipation, insomnia, and loss of appetite. And the weidest of all was the fact that he was getting more and more depressed, but he could not sit still. He was out until 1:00 am while having to work the next day. I would really think about this drug before taking it, there are other better alternatives.

I had a HORRIBLE reaction to Cymbalta. Sleep disturbances including severe nightmares, night sweats & insomnia. I had racing & spiraling thoughts, felt like I was not in control of my mind, agitation, restlessness, overwhelming sadness, crying, suicidal ideation, & pressured thoughts.  I had intrusive thoughts grounded in past traumatic life events and one thought would rapidly spiral to another. These events occurred over a 3 week period under a doctor's care.  I had no concentration, did not trust myself to drive, couldn't tolerate a lot of noise or activity around me and had awkward social interactions.  Over the past twenty years I have had success with Prozac, Paxil, Wellbutrin & Zoloft but never a reaction like I had to this drug. I have an advanced professional degree, and consider myself an informed consumer.  This was a horrible experience for me.

I talked to my doctor about it and he gave me a weeks trial of cymbalta, and said when I was done taking it to fill my prescription. When I started taking it, it made me feel physically horrible. I would get abdominal pain and dry heave. Every time I took it, 10 minutes later I spent 20 minutes in the restroom feeling sick to my stomach. It didn't really help at all. I would be left feeling empty and numb both physically and emotionally. Yes I wasn't really depressed, and my anxiety wasn't really as bad anymore, but I still didn't feel normal. I never filled my prescription either. Now I try to deal with my symptoms in the most natural way possible. I try to relax, meditate, think to myself, ""it could always be worse."""

I was able to do more and had more confidence. It gave me that false sense of everything being perfect. BUT it made me sweat SO bad. Going to the gym was embarrassing, walking outside, pretty much doing anything that required physical movement ended with me being covered in sweat. Nights were by far the worst - I would wake up several times a night soaking wet with sweat. I decided to come off of it about a month and a half ago - my doctor cut the dosage slowly and then had me go every other day and every third day. Unfortunately, I am still feeling the withdraw symptoms pretty badly. I get dizzy and nauseated a lot and still sweat quite a bit. If I had known this would be so hard to come off of I would have stuck with the depression! It has been 11 days since I have taken any dosage - hopefully it will get better soon.

My doc wants me to start up on something else but I want to KNOW when this drug will not be effecting me anymore first - I am trying to be patient with the ""normal"" (?) symptoms of being off antidepressants like crying and changes in mood/sleep, etc -- until I know this drug is out of my system. It's weird and I wonder if even those people who respond well ON this drug would have this adverse effect getting OFF of it. Not something to look forward to, believe me. "

Pain is very much diminished although not gone altogether but enough so that I can work and live my life. It has helped my depression which I didn't even realize I had till after I took this drug and started to feel good and so more like myself.

Everything was fine until I began to notice that the symptoms of my depression were returning. This wasn't itself unusual because in the past the effectiveness of other anti-depressants would slowly wear off over time as well. With Cymbalta however, I had a unique experience that I am still suffering through today and one that I would not wish on my worst enemies. Two days after I stopped taking it, my memory, concentration, and happiness decreased to a hellish level. I would frequently have ""brain zaps"" and uncontrollable crying spells, as well as extreme paranoia (I thought it was the end of me). I began to feel out of touch with reality and even my eyesight began to seem fuzzy and dreamlike. Physically, I could not keep food down and threw up constantly as well experiencing digestive problems. My psychiatrist didn't know what was happening, so, as hard as it was with my apathy, I took it upon myself to discover what was going on. I scoured the internet until I came upon information documenting ""SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome."" I'm sure others here have commented on it, because it apparently is not an isolated condition. It was a living hell, and six months later, although a different medication(Prozac) has helped, I still feel the effects. It's a rare occurrence, and I know how devastating depression is, but take my advice and be careful before you use this or any other SSRI. And, if you ultimately do decide upon Cymbalta, make sure that you taper yourself of very gradually; the consequences are beyond what I ever imagined even on my worst days of depression. Be safe, good luck."

I am very sensitive to all categories of antidepressants except SSRIs and this SNRI. So, it has been a blessing in that respect. Emotionally, I do feel a little numb, but in my case that's not bad and I keep in touch with my MDs.
3798$Condition: Neuropathic Pain$9/28/2008 12:53:16 AM$Reviewer: cb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$3$Personally, I have not exerienced any relief in terms to pain itself. It may be helping me indirectly some other way but I cannot be certain. Since I have triedn epidural injections, medications, rest, bath, walks, PT, chiropractic, psychologist and meditations for the last few months, oh! and a lot of music and play time with my cat; it's been very difficult to put a finger on anything. Sadly, my pain is worse and I am on medical leave from work and stressed. Family and friends have been a wonderful support system to talk and spend time with as much as I can. Issues have been DIZZINESS and BITTER TASTE since starting this med. Sadly, even ice cream tastes bitter. :-( Happily lost a few pounds and now I fit into my old ward robe, but it's not a healthy way to loose; so I'm trying to eat nutritious food items when able. I am not really hungry but try to eat at least 2 meals as possible without snacking unnecessarily. My doctor says that she hasn't heard of AE of the 'bitter taste' side effect, and I have read all the literature from Lilly as well. Hope it works a little better in the near future. Wish the rest of you guys all the best. Light and Love to all. Hang in there!!!!

Before I started on this drug it felt as if I had rubbed capsaicin on my legs everyday.  I didn't realize I was already suffereing from neuropathy after only being diagnosed with T1 Diabetes 3 years ago.  Started on 60 Mg daily then increased to 90.  I do think it helps with anxiety.  I'm a stay at home mom of 3 and I often have anxiety issues. You would too!). Anyway, the caution here- DO NOT MISS A DOSE. I did for one day and boy did I pay for it in withdrawal symptoms.  BIG MISTAKE! Got back on after realizing what I had done in error. I just started Lyrica  for Fibro (50 mg daily 1 hr before bedtime). Not sure if it's helping with pain and I'm not sleeping too well, although I feel sleepy all the time now.  Really feel like I need something else for pain relief in back and shoulders. Would love to sleep through the night without any other sleep aids.  By the way, I also have CRAZY vivid dreams on Cymbalta. Sometimes I can't remeber if something really happened or if it only happened in a dream the night before. That's really weird.

I've experienced none of the possible side effects! Maybe because I didn't read about the side effects prior to starting therapy with CYMBALTA. I would reccomend CYMBALTA to anyone suffering from depression. I've no loss of libido or ant erectile problems. I did talk to my Doctor prior to starting therapy about these side effects, he assured me both of these[side effects] happened very rarely. All I can say is I'm very thankful for Pharmacologists.

Twice I was prescribed cymbalta. Both times were for chronic pain and depression combination. Soon after starting it the first time my condition seemed to worsen, whole body aches, feet, legs, knees, hips, back, neck, shoulder, muscles, bones, to the point I was then diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I was a mess, I was on so many different meds. that's why they chose cymbalta, it's supposed to be the least reactive with other meds., who knew what was doing what or causing what. I stopped the cymbalta as I was having stomach issues and it seemed as though they started soon after starting the cymbalta. About 6-8 months later some of those whole body issues subsided, Thank God! Recently my Dr., was concerned with depression again with the chronic pain issues and restarted me on the cymbalta, OMG it all started again within 4 hours after taking the first 60 mg capsule. Two doses, 3 days of *ell, body aches, feet, legs, knees, hips, etc, you get the picture. I'll battle the chronic pain, and the depression, and maybe there is something else out there, but for me it's not cymbalta.

Cymbalta was the first medication that, after about 16-20 days of treatment completely and consistently eased these symptoms. For the past 17 months, I have not experienced anything but what I would term ""normal"" anxiety and depression or sadness. If I miss two or more doses, however, I begin to experience uncontrollable irritation and anger. Also, the two major physical side effects seem to be bouts of severe but superficial itching over most of my body or sometimes isolated to a single spot and also erectile dysfunction, neither of which is serious enough that I would consider giving up the benefits of the medication."

Under the advice of my psychiatrist, after 5 days on it, I discontinued the mediacation.

As I sit here writing this I am trying to discontinue the use of cymbalta. I was put on cymbalta for more than 1 reason. Anxiety, Depression, and Pain. I have this awful feeling in my head and waves of ""yukky"" for lack of a better term that run through my body. It seemed to help after 7 weeks or so, but now that it has been 7 months I feel like I am without much feeling anymore.  With the exception of anger or edginess.  That I certainly feel! Constant short bouts of dizziness, mostly when getting up.  I am not looking forward to the next few weeks of trying to get off this medication. I pray that it is not as bad as Effexor.  All I do know is that my daughter deserves better and I am once again on the search for something else.  MAJOR ODD SIDE EFFECT....After taking years for my breast milk to dry up after the birth of my daughter, it has returned DUE TO CYMBALTA.  This side effect is rare but nonetheless it IS a side effect.  My doctor found this out for me when I informed her of this on my last visit.  I just feel like there are far more bad than good effects to come out of this medication. Thanks for reading. "

Even had a series if 12 ECTs TX in 2006....after 1 1/2 weeks I could tell a positive difference in my anxiety, using less Ativan. Now after 4 weeks, daily overall depression and anxiety are almost non-exsisitant. I do take Adderall xr 20 mg 5 times per week, which helps to kick up my energy level like it was prior to taking Cymbalta. The only 2 side effects for me are constipation(normal with these drugs) and lower energy(not normal for me) ...However, NOT enough to stop the Cymbalta....Thank You.......Janet

I had been on Zoloft in the past and did not want to use anti-depressants again, but this one was different.  It treated all of my symptoms and that included anxiety. THE DOWN SIDE IS, and I wish Doctors would make it clearer, that if you miss a couple of doses, you could have bad withdrawal symptoms.  I didn't have money and missed a couple days, no big deal right? Wrong! I started having these ""shock"" feelings.  Since I have a heart condition, I called the Dr. but got no response. I started searching internet and found that ""startling"" or whatever I was feeling was common for Anxiety patients.  That led me to Cymbalta & side effects of going off it, and sure enough.  
They called it ""brain zaps"", ""brain shocks"" and so forth. It felt like electric shocks going through my body repeatedly and randomly.  Stress seemed to make it worse.  

Apparently, you have to taper off very slowly. One lady even went so far as to open the capsule, count the tiny beads and gradually reduce the amount in each pill! 

I LOVE THIS drug otherwise!! I actually feel good for the first time in years.  
Not drugged; just good! I would recommend it to anyone not satisfied with other anti-dep. and those with fibromyalgia.  A lot of aches & pains I was having went away with Cymbalta.
I don't really feel any side effects either.  [Zoloft made me nervous and couldn't sleep or eat, so Dr. gave me Xanax, which is highly addictive. That’s another story.]

Work stresses had begun to manifest several symptoms in me, the most notable being high blood pressure.  (I had gone from 130/85 to 200/100.)
I was given lysinopril for the blood pressure, and it only worked when I was at work; it made me sick otherwise.  It lowered my blood pressure too much.  My physician also gave me cymbalta.  That was a different story.
After a couple days of taking cymbalta, I realized something was different; my spinal cord stopped aching.  I didn't even realize that it had started aching.  I sure noticed when it stopped.  Instead of ""longing for death"" (just an expression, not truly literal.) I began to feel hopeful that I could take control of my life again.  It gave me the space and the perspective to make changes in my life.  A new job on the horizon, laughter with my wife and I've been off all medication for over a year.  That's the great thing.  I only needed to take the cymbalta for 3-4 months.  
I've heard that the best depression treatment results occur when the first medicine works.  If you are looking for that first treatment and you ache from depression and feel like there is no solution possible, consider asking your doctor for cymbalta.

For the first week - I was started on a 30mg dose to acclamate my body. Lot's of nausea & sleepiness. Then I ramped up to the 60mg dose where I turned into a Zombie & did not interact with my kids or wife. After a month or 2 of taking a 1 hour nap after work & typically missing dinner, I asked my Dr. to drop it down to 30mg. Now I experience the sleepiness again. I did find that Cymbalta helped me straighten out, but my depressive thoughts did not go away - they were only suppressed. I was & continue to be very negative about work, as I am a small business owner who has suffered the most trying time in my career of over 20 years (financially). I believe for me Cymbalta was the right thing to do as I think it has had me focus on what is making me feel this way. I hate what I do. My insecurity has taken a huge toll on my physical & mental being. I am going to ask my Dr. to ween myself off of Cymbalta only for the reason I don't know how much more this can help me. I hope all of you find the correct doseage / treatment & can get back to being yourselves. Give it time & understand there are things you simply can't change in the world.

I like wine and beer but always have been able to control my intake. However, since starting on Cymbalta once I start drinking (especially red wine) I find myself unable to stop. I've had more hangovers in the past three months than I've had in 40 years. There's a connection but only we who take Cymbalta seem to know about it. What's the use of not being depressed if you turn into a drunk? BTW, read health sites and you'll find my situation is quite common.

I also take Methadone for chronic pain but adding the Cymbalta has really halped me alot.  
My husband was diagnosed 8/4/08 with a relapse of his lung cancer and now it is throughout his vertebrae and some lymphnodes. I am thankful I'm on the Cymbalta to help with the stress.  I seem to sleep better even though I have a C-PAP machine for sleep apnea.  My 4-year old has been happy to see ""momma"" have more energy and be more jovial rather than grumpy.  I wake up more refreshed in the mornings and have a better outlook on life.  I recommend everyone with Fibromyalgia and/or Neuropathy to try it, however I don't recommend it to replace any existing pain medication(s) you might be taking.

I am really thinking about stopping the meds and try a more old fashioned protocol....diet, exercise, positive attitude, etc. I read some of others reactions...and the majority felt little satisfaction. Doctor's can very easily say ""lets try this med and see what happens""....their expertise is limited, I feel and sometimes it's up to us to do the research as to drug interaction, side effects, etc because everyone is so different and the new wave of drugs seems to be a marketing program...a pill will solve all your problems....and what about the withdrawal reactions...I've read many of the horror stories here....fortunately, I've only been on Cymbalta for several weeks...can you imagine, one year...no way!!!!I will call my MD to ween me off the meds (even for such a short period of time) and go back to Alleve and joint relief...not a magic bullet, but lessens the side effects and an absolute minimual withdrawal when needed. Again, do your homework, research, and make your decisions occurdingly. Don't rely on a doctor that has hundreds of patients...how can that be adequately effective?????"

I just wanted to let every one know there can be life after Cymbalta. I took it for over three years, and when it wasn't working any more I wanted to get off of it. I was taking 60 mg. and my Dr. gave me 30 mg. and told me to take one daily for four days, then one every other day for three doses, and I should be OK. Well after a week of being off of the medication I was very sick. I went to the Dr. and he thought I had a stomach bug. I was very nauseated, cramping, and diarrhea. He gave me a medication for nausea, and said I should be fine in a few days. Well another week went by, and I was worse really thought I was  going to die. I tried to get back in to see him, and couldn't get an apt. so I called a Dr. friend that I used to work for that had moved away, and she told me that my Dr. took me off of it too fast. That I should taper off one daily for two weeks, then one every other day for two weeks, then one every three days for two weeks. I called my Dr. and asked for more medication, and started taking it again after being off for two weeks. I did like my Dr. friend told me, and I have been without a pill for 6 days now, and I am feeling a lot better. My advice for any one trying to get off is not to stop it suddenly, but taper off like I did.On my first post I gave my e-mail address, and I have had four women contact me. I have started a little support group for any one that would like to contact me to discuss what they are going through. One of my new e-mail friends named it the DEVIL PILL. It has really been nice having some one to talk to,and to know that I am not going through this alone. This is a terrible drug I will never take it again. I can't believe it is sold legally, it should be a street drug. The two weeks I was off before tapering off is the worse I have ever felt. Good luck to all of you that are going through this. My prayers are with you.

That is what caused my breast cancer. But the doc's have tried me on many of the antidepresants in the last 10 years for my fybromyalgia. None of them ever worked. They kinda made me crazy. Well I could never relax. And it just seemed like my mind would race all the time. It was terriable. Never wanted to stay alone. Well when I got down after the breast cancer, the doc put me on cymbalta. I'm dealing with going through my change. And alot of different things. I have been on cymbalta for about 3 months. I think it is a miricale drug. My mood is great. Everyday. I don't worry as much. I was a real worry wort all the time. And I really didn't want to take this either. But then I tried it. Like I said it works great for me. But I no everyone's body reacts different to drugs. But I think nothing but good with it. I did have some nausa with it in the begining. Like maybe 3 weeks. But was not that bad. Now that went away. It may make me have hot flashes. But I'm going trough that anyway. But it does not make me bitchy or nothing. It has done nothing but improved my mood. Good luck to anyone dealing with pain-anxiety-depression. Because I no it is no fun. I do think that the cymbalta has helped my pain to. But I also take pain meds daily to. Good Luck to all. & thanks alot for

3950$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/13/2008 5:01:12 PM$Reviewer: sc_butterfly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$3$5$I am a 41 year old female, 6 yrs ago I was diagnosed with lung cancer at age 34 and had lung removal twice within a 6 week period. I had nerve damage which resulted from the surgerys, as well as depression and anxiety many years before I had been diagnosed with cancer. I was prescribed Cymbalta for both anxiety and nerve pain and have been taking Cymbalta 60 mg for over 5 yrs now, it has worked very well but with a few unwanted side effects. The main side effect is nausea, it also effects the sex drive which isn't always a good thing if you know what I mean. The last side effect is forgetting or simply just not taking it for whatever reason, my advise don't put yourself in that situation, it will make you feel awful. I felt numb and in slow motion ( example: my eyes would move to look at an object to the right of me, my eye balls moved but my sight was delayed on zeroing in on the object), it takes up to 3 days to feel normal again. For the most part the benefits of the drug out way the side effects and it does help with nerve pain. I would recommend this drug to all with nerve pain and anybody who suffers with depression and anxiety. Good luck...

I lashed out at my family and went on crying jags about unreasonable things. I gradually increased my dosage from 30 to 60 mg, with the main side effects being nausea and lack of appetite which lasted for 1-2 months. I'm thrilled with the emotional results of this medication. I feel like I've been balenced out, and I'm no longer set out of alignment by the littlest thing. I even call it my ""happy medicine."" A month ago I started to have very vivid dreams every night, which I'd never had in the past. This is a known side effect of Cymbalta, and after the dreams started getting more and more disturbing my doctor and I decided to reduce my dosage back to 30 mg. The dreams are still there, but they're less weird. Ultimately if they keep effecting my sleep I'm going to phase out and change to Effexor, but the mood effects of this drug are so good I'm hesitant to switch. I haven't had any weight fluctuations with it, either. Really, it's a helpful drug."

3963$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/8/2008 10:01:14 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $3$1$3$"I have had been on 60 mg for about 8 months after switching from Paxil. I had been on both for generalized anxiety/depression (not together, but separately). The drug itself worked fine for me, not great, not terrible. Compared to Paxil, the Cymbalta didn't have near the brain zaps you suffer when you forget to take a dose -- I could forget a dose of Cymbalta for a day or two and be fine. Now, this sound contradictory, but my big hang-up comes after deciding that I wanted to see if I could go pill free. In short, Cymbalta has/was been VERY hard to ween off of. I stupidly tried ""cold turkey"" and that was a HUGE mistake -- I do not recommend it to anyone. I was pretty much bed ridden for 3 days -- sleeping, dizzy and nauseous... it hurt to even open my eyes. I then listened to reason and had my family doctor work me through a weening phase over a month which was more bearable, though the brain zaps was pretty continual, but not NEARLY as bad (you'd have to have experienced them to know what I'm talking about -- if you have -- you know exactly what I mean -- it's hard to explain the feeling). The last week I was trying to pull apart the 20mg caplets and guesstimate what half the granules was, but figured I was making a bigger mess than just stopping altogether. It's now been 4 days (as of 7-8-08). The brain zaps are still there, but very tolerable. Fortunately, I think I'm through it. I did this a year ago when on Paxil (weening off) and it was not NEAR this bad."

I also have diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia. It did give some pain relief but it made me not care about anything. I didn't/don't see a point to anything except sleeping, stopped showering even. I became withdrawn and don't go out of the house. Don't get off the couch unless I have to use the restroom or get food. Absolutely no energy. I was not suicidal before trying this medicine and it made me think about killing myself constantly. Not because of depression, just thoughts I couldn't control. I'm off of it now my doctor told me to stop it immediately. Thankfully the constant suicidal thoughts are easing up but I still have NO emotions. Nothing has a point. My neurapthy is pretty painful so it did help with pain but be careful. I want to feel better, this is awful.

The paxil never worked very well for me- it was better than nothing but the reason I stuck with it was I had a psychiatrist who didn't trust newer meds and paxil was the oldest SSRI with implications for Anxiety. I switched to cymbalta when I changed doctors. 

First few weeks were a little rough, I was nauseus, constipated, and dizzy.  But after the first 3 weeks most of that went away.  I still have a little trouble with constipation, but it's worth it!  I am CALM most of the time now.  I can see things clearly!  I also give credit to a new Cognitive Behavioral Therapist, but I know the meds help.  And I have really nice, intricate dreams!

For all the people who are having a rough time with side effects early on (the first few days) try to wait it out! It might be worth it for you. "

After I had my dosage increased from 10-15mg I felt awful.  I immediately switched to EffexorXR.  At my highest dose of EffexorXR I was at 150mg.  I was disappointed with the sexual side effects that I was experiencing with EffexorXR, so my doctor prescribed a small dose of Welbutrin to see if it would alleviate my symptoms.

Unfortunately, the combination medication didn't help and I just felt cranky.  I decided to give Cymbalta a try.

After just a few days of being on Cymbalta, the sexual SE I was experiencing were gone!  I felt as though I'd regained my sex life!  It definitely helped me out a lot.

The only downside that I have experienced is that if I don't take my dose on time I can feel SE (for me my anxiety kicks in within a few hours, and my depression comes back in a few days if I continue to miss a few doses.  This is probably typical with most AD, though.

At the same time, a pain management doctor prescribed Lyrica for  severe pain in my right foot and ankle caused by diabetic neuropathy.  The two meds together completely eliminated my at rest foot pain. When I reported this result to my pain management doctor, he told me that he often prescribed the two together for neuropathic pain or myalgia. I am very satisfied with the combination of Cymbalta and Lyrica. I do plan to ask my doctor about the long term effects of both meds.

Nov 2007 I was prescribed cymbalta, early Dec it was increased to 60mg at night and 30mg in am.  Just before Christmas I awoke one morning - and was so happy to be alive. This has occurred, but never for any length of time, on and off in my life - but into the first week of June and regardless of outside influences which have been at times traumatic - I still wake up each day happy to be alive, a mood which stays with me until the next morning.  This medication in my opinion is the miracle I had been told by age 60 I would probably never see. The change in the subconscious mood from wishing to be dead into hoping to live until 100 so I can truly live life is one of the 3 most important things that is in my life- the other two being my adult children.

My insomnia continued with Cymbalta even though I had some of it with Effexor towards the end of my taking it. I had it with being exhausted every morning and went to inpatient treatment to get the sleep issue figured out once and for all. It took a second doctor (who now has replaced my former one!) to discover that SNRIs (Effexor and Cymbalta) were causing me to wake up about many, many times during the night even though I was taking Ambien at bedtime.  Stopping the Cymbalta suddenly, as I did, caused me to feel discontinuation effects for TWO WEEKS with those darned ""brain zaps"".  We're still trying to tweak all my medications now that I've dropped Cymbalta (90 mg) and Buspar, kept the Wellbutrin XL, and have now added Abilify.  I think Cymbalta can be a great medication for a wide range of people but it just didn't work that well for me. "

I have taken Effexor the longest, 150mg. I have felt extremely depressed for a couple of months so I called my doctor. Dr. started me on 60mg Cymbalta with 75mg Effexor for one week, stepping down to 37.5mg the next week. So far, feeling better, not suffering any bad side effects, not feeling any effects withdrawing from the Effexor. I do take Provigil, 200mg, that was prescribed to counter the lethargic effect of Effexor (look up amotivational syndrome, an antidepressant effect you may not be aware of)and Ambien 10mg to counter the sleeplessness I was experiencing on the Effexor. I agree the information I've read about Cymbalta disturbs me but being depressed disturbs me more. If I missed a dose of Effexor, I could tell and if it was more than one dose, I felt ""brain zaps"" and a disconnected feeling. I think those are pretty common side effects of a lot of anti-depressants, not just Cymbalta. I hate to say this but some side effects of Cymbalta could be self-fullfilling, if you believe you will suffer ill effects, you may do just that. Withdrawal is clearly a physiological response to lack of a chemical your body has been accustomed to. I hope I have no additional weight gain as I feel the Effexor has done enough of that. A week in, so far, so good."

I am exausted from all of this.  the cymbalta is the only different medication I have been taking.  I think it is great if it helps you, but I will not take it again ever.  I will go back to prozac and to heck with trying all the new crap they keep coming out with.  If what I am having is withdrawls from only two months..that is some scarey stuff..Good luck to you all..Lyrica wasn't this bad..never ever had anything like this in my life...

I am not sure as to the mg he started me on, but I do know that I will only be taking half of a pill a day for the next 2 weeks.

Along with 60 mg of norco daily, it manages the pain and helps the depression.  Have previously been on Prozac,and Wellbutrin, but they both stopped working.  Celexa helped the depression, but did nothing for the pain.  Sex drive is also back.  Takes time to work, but would recommend giving cymbalta a chance.

My understanding is that SSRI's (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Cymbalta, etc.) could have tendency to cause those issues.  But it is tricky to point the finger at SSRI's because clinical depression can cause the very symptoms I listed above.

4055$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$5/9/2008 4:28:31 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$4$"I was diagnosed with clinical depression 19 years ago (technically Type II Bipolar, according to my doc.) and have been on a range of meds, as you can imagine.  Cymbalta is the latest.  I've noticed over the years that SSRI's (Paxil, Prozac, etc) have worked for a couple years, then stopped working or turned counterproductive for me.  The doc would then recommend a newer generation SSRI.  
Prozac actually was a breakthrough for me back in the 90's.  Then I went on Zoloft, but discontinued due to skin rashes.  Paxil worked pretty well for me, but I experienced those awful ""brain shocks"" about the 3rd year, and had to discontinue.  While on Cymbalta I've noticed within the last year a very annoying sensation of a ""gag"" reflex (coming from my throat area).  That I attribute to Cymbalta, although Lithium or Lamictal may be involved.  (I'm on 3 mainline meds.)  I've also noticed some weight gain.  I'll talk to my doc to see if it's time for switch or to make adjustments with the other 2 meds.  "

Overall, it worked great for my depression. A few months after starting, I began to gain weight despite eating right. I have also been trying to quit smoking so my doctor switched me to Wellbutrin recently. I have not taken Cymbalta for a week now and I wish I would just not wake up. I had intense withdrawals from stopping Effexor XR in the past and hoped to never experience that again. My doctor told me to discontinue Cymbalta without weaning off. I will make it a point not to see him while I am going thru the withdrawals because I just might hurt him. I have never felt so awful in my life. I have severe brain zaps that have increased within the past week, body aches, chills, visual disturbances, dizziness, extreme anger at any given moment, extreme sadness at any given moment, and thoughts of wanting to die. I have put my husband and children through hell the past week and from what I have read, it will only get worse until my body is completely free of the drug. For anyone out there thinking of beginning an antidepressant, read all you can about the drug including the withdrawal symptoms. I have taken at least six different antidepressants over the past 10 years and all of them worked, but only for awhile. I work for a neurologist who treats fibromyalia and diabetic neuropathies and have seen patients who would rather deal with the pain than the side effects of Cymbalta. I think it is strange that the clinical trials and studies have not been published regarding Cymbalta. We are like lab rats enabling these pharmacutical companies to make a profit. Depression is something no one should have to deal with but honestly, I would rather be depressed than want to kill myself. Thankfully, my family and friends have been there for me, if not, I wouldn't be here. Please research before starting any antidepressant. They only work for awhile and then you are left dealing with the horrific withdrawal symptoms.

When I first tried to get off of it 7 months ago, because I felt like it was not helping w/ my pain or anything, the doctor doubled it to 60mg. I went ahead with it and all the symptoms have gotten worse, all of it. I am trying to get off of it and my doctor said take 30mg for 2 weeks and then I would be fine. I knew that would not be true, the brain zaps are so bad when I miss one day. I am going to start over and try the road back - look it up. I cried reading all these comments. It is horrible to be given a medication to help with pain and it causes pain. I hate my doctor now! I know it will not be easy, but can't wait to have my life back. It should not be this hard to get off of this stuff. I know already what the withdrawls are like - it is horrible. But I know I have to do this before my liver shuts down, or I get blood clots or loose my mind. Don't take this highly addictive, bad side effects drug.

Within the last 2 mos, started Xanax because Cymbalta doesn't help with the anxiety or panic attacks. Have a new Dr. and trying to work out a different game plan.

I had used other SSRI's and they worked for depression & anxiety (phobias completely gone) but when I developed fibromyalgia, my life was no longer worth living and I broke down physically and mentally last Christmas.  I immediately went to my doctor, scheduled counseling and began Cymbalta. Four months later I have discarded my handicapped parking sticker, my cane and am now biking 60 miles a week, and for the first time in years, I found myself SMILING out of the blue one day, even the muscles that controlled the smile twitched because it had been so long.  This drug was exactly what I needed to balance my life again. I am truly *happy* for the first time in my life despite my grim medical outcome. I have placed my problems in perspective now, thinking much clearer. When I think that I was ""this"" close to ending my life I realized that it COULD be pain-free and bountiful. The only side effects I had were actually helpful, loss of appetite and incresed sexual desire.  I sweat like a sumo wrestler but it is worth every extra shower I take to feel this whole again. BTW, fibromyalgia is far worse than the cancer pain and was GREATLY helped by this drug.  I am so grateful for it!"

After reading all these reviews I am half afraid to try taking it and would love to talk to other people who are on it for Fibromyalgia.  On top of the Fibro, I have migraine headaches and even with taking Ambien, Ambien CR and Sonata at different times I do not sleep good.  It takes me forever to fall asleep, I wake up a few hours later and then lay there til morning. I have been on many different anti depressants over the years, some working ok for a while and others not seeming to do anything at all so my Dr. felt Cymbalta might help.  I have experienced weight gain with other drugs and now fear this one will make me gain weight and I already weigh enough from other drugs and have not been able to lose any of it.  As I said if you have Fibro and are taking this please email me, just put webmd Fibro in the subject line so I don't delete you!  I am also wondering when the best time would be to take it, morning or not to be ablemto hopefully sleep at night? I plan on starting this tonight, thought taking it at night might be better but now I'm not so sure.  My email is [email protected]   Thanks!

I started off on Lexapro, but it didn't seem to work for long, and the sexual side effects were driving me crazier than the depression.  My psychiatrist added Wellbutrin on top of the Lexapro, but that made me feel like a maniac after just one day, so I stopped taking it.  Then he switched me to Cymbalta.  

My only concern lately is that I'm having some bouts of depression here and there.  I've been trying to take a ""mental inventory"" to decide if it's all situational depression, but this latest bout has me thinking that maybe my dosage needs to be increased, or it's time to find something else.

I have noticed the weight gain ever since I started taking this medication.  I've ballooned up about 40 pounds since I started taking Cymbalta.  I had no idea so many others were experiencing this as well.  I'm having trouble losing this weight, too.  "

Brain zaps, fuzzieness etc lasted about 4 weeks.  Afterwards the hormonal swing of midmonth/perimenpause was HORRIBLE.  Don't know if it's related to withdrawal or not but am taking Wellbutrin now.  Weight gain was a big issue, night time bingeing was unstoppable.  WEIRD dreams and night sweats also became common after about 5 months of usage, that's why I stopped.  Great for leg cramps that I often had at night but not worth all the other side-effects.

I have tried several anti-depressants, but this combined with lamictal has improved things. I used to be really angry, paranoid, occationally suicidal, and would cry ALL the time. Cymbalta was added to the lamictal because I had a week of anxiety so bad I couldn't sleep and had difficulty breathing. That was on vacation in Florida!
Side effects noted were nausia the first week. I work nights, so I took it in the morning before I went to sleep to reduce this. Sexual disfunction is mostly indifference and delayed orgasm. I have been on this for about 3 months now and a couple weeksa ago I started having horrible nightmares! Really really horrible!!! I can even tell I am dreaming and cannot get out of it and if I do wake up, it will start were it left off, unless I get up for hours or the day.
I don't if these go away, but even it they don't I think I will probably continue using it.

I have suffered from constant tiredness since taking Cymbalta as well as mood swings and severe sexual dysfunction. I have read all the post. I do wish I would have done my own research before my gynocologist put me on this. I also wished he would have warned me about the side effects prior to putting me on it. He basically said here ya go. I was on 60mg a day. I had to stop taking it ""cold turkey"". My doc was out of samples and could not afford to fill the RX. I was on it for 8 months. I feel like I am going through detox. I am dealing with it though. I am so very tired but I am making myself get out and do what I need to do. Sunshine is helping. I am so nauseus.

I just stress that a person do there own research. I am so glad that i came across this portion of the website. It has helped me to know that some of the symptoms I am feeling are common and that lessens my fears.

When the doctor upped my dosage to 60mg. I looked wonderful, 10 years younger(no joke), and didn't worry about anything- so unlike myself.  I was a new person :)  Suddenly my gums started bleeding (don't know whether it was Cymbalta related.   I started getting really irritable and lost two of my best friends due to my overeactions to their comments.  Was heartbroken because they were the ones who suggested that I go for treatment.   I tried going cold turkey, but couldn't, so the doctor switched me to something else on a very low dosage every other day.   With this medication I had vivid dreams, sweats, buzzing in the ear (only when originally getting on and coming off this medication)

The upside to the whole experience was that I finally didn't overeact - I only wish I was naturally like that.  I was outspoken and made friends easily (something I could never do)  It was very effective but only for a short while- I wish I could have lasted on it.

Suggestion:  NEVER go cold turkey without going too the doctor.

I have tried other drugs for depression, nothing else has worked for me.  I thought Cymbalta was a wonder drug.  I was still depressed while taking it, but all of my anxiety was gone.  However, it doesn't work for me anymore!  I started to feel like I had the flu constantly...lots of joint pain, hot flashes, numbness and tingling on my face, among other things. I think I have the ""brain zaps"" that others refer to, it is such a weird feeling, like my eyes are floating around in their sockets and my brain is floating around behind my eyes!  I have stopped taking Cymbalta altogether, and of course, I feel terrible.  Insatiable hunger, high pulse rate, dizziness, terrible insomnia, frequent urination, and probably other symptoms that I am overlooking right now.  I am going to see the doctor today and I hope we can get something under control. I wish I could recommend this drug, but the withdrawal is really terrible and the benefits weren't as amazing as I thought they were when I first started taking it.  Based on other people's opinions that I have read, I don't think anyone should take it.  One user on another web site said that he had an easier time getting off of crystal meth than he did with getting off of Cymbalta.  Interesting, considering the poison that is in that drug.  It makes me sad that this drug doesn't work for me anymore.  I thought that I had finally found something after years of searching for help!  "

Now I have the brain zaps, lack of energy, dizziness, etc. from withdrawal that others have described on here.  Its is horrible, can't function hardly at all.  Would like to  other peoples schedules of getting off this stuff.  I am currently on 30mg. and taking one pill every 3 days now.  Just wondering how long others had to take it and what their final schedule was when they finally stopped.  So glad I read the withdrawal posts on here, now I know it isn't just me.  Anyone that can post some withdrawal schedule information, I would really appreciate it.  My Dr. wanted me to go from 90mg. daily to 60mg daily for one week, then one 60mg every other day for one week then stop.  Glad I didn't do it that way, went back and got some 30mg samples to wean off at slower rate.

Cymbalta was the only new medication so I decided to stop taking it.  Side effects included dizziness, insomnia, mental fog. I felt like I was loosing it at times. It took about 8 weeks of decreasing the dosage   (60 mg to 30 mg) from daily to every other day, every two days, etc. before I was able to stop.  I am now free and feel like a new person.  Never again will I take cymbalta nor can I recommend it to others.  I felt like a drug addict coming down from a drug.  It was horrible.

I also have very weak nails and was wearing silk wraps on them when I started taking Cymbalta. After about a month the silk wraps wouldn't stay on so I went to acrylic. I ended up having to take them off. After I quit taking Cymbalta I had the wraps put back on and all was well until I tried to take it again. I haven't heard of anyone else having this side effect.

Soon after starting on it, I decided that there was nothing wrong with me and I took myself off of it.  It was obvious right away that I could not do without it!  I didn't have any withdrawals because I weened myself off of it slowly.  I was in so much pain that I couldn't get out of bed and had to cancel all my plans.  I will never do without it again!  I was able to do without my other pain medicines like Ultram, Vicodin, and Tylenol #3 with Codiene.  I am very happy with it and plan on sticking with it.

I took the med and felt great, took away neck and back pain immedietly. Then 4 weeks into it I felt hungry all the time and even after I ate a huge meal I would feel hungry. I stayed on the med for 5 months then just quit taking it because of the hunger and weight gain, despite exercising an hour 5 days a week. The withdrawl was hell, but what i didn't realize is that if you have blood sugar problems like I have (hypoglycemia) this med aggravated it and that is why I was hungry all the time and never felt full. Be sure to check thyroid first too because thyroid and depression symtoms are the same as was my case, but didn't find that out until after going through the expense of the med and hell of the withdrawl.

Doc has me on 60MG of Cymbalta, and 0.5 mg of klonopin, .25 in the AM and .25 in the evening.   Strangely enough, I am not building up any tolerance to the klonopin.  It just smooths out the day.  No adverse impacts or side effects that I know of. Sometimes I think that reading the warnings are counterproductive. You may have side effects just because you think you may have them.

They have gotten extermely bad and my doctor suggested trying Cymbalta. I have never experienced such bad side effects from any drug. It started with nausea and vomiting. Nausea was constant. I couldn't sleep at night even after trying to switch the time I took Cymbalta. Over the counter sleep aids had no effect. I was now missing more work then I did with the migraines which are still there. The diarrhea is horrible and uncontrolable at times. I called my doctor and he said to just stop taking it. I'm four days into being Cymbalta free and I have never felt worse in my life. I can't begin to explain the exhaustion I am feeling. I spent the majority of the weekend, my scheduled day off, and had to leave work again today because I am so sick. I was in the bathroom since 5:30 in the morning getting throwing up. I don't know how much of this I can take anymore. I did research side effects before I started the drug. Didn't find a lot of information. I certainly didn't find any information on the withdrawal until I started to read reviews here. I do at least feel better after reading other reviews. Thought I was going crazy and that I was the only one struggling with this one. If you are thinking about taking this drug, don't do it. I totally regret ever trying this medicine and I just hope I can make it through the rest of the withdrawls.

I have biploar disorder and I use this with Lamictal. It is important that if you have bipolar or to use a mood stabilizer along with an antidepressant. Do not use an anti-depressant alone as this can cause a manic episode and/or deeper depression. Also, do not get this drug from a PCP, you must be evaluated by a Psychiatrist. General Practitioners do not know enough about this type of medicine. I experienced two years of hell trying to control mania and depression, as I was misdiagnosed by my doctor. Psychiatrists are the only one's truly qualified to diagnose the type of depression you have as there is many differnt variations and contributing factors. Wrong dosages and a misdiagnosis can send you into a nightmare and can actually make it worse and cause long term negative effects on your mental health.

I have found it very helpful.  Before I started this medication I was on prozac for 8 years and none of the doctors would listen to me when I would tell them it was not doing the job. I was having severe panic attacks and thoughts of suicide and found that I was actually Bipolar not just depressed by my surroundings as I had been told for so many years. My children couldnt stand me and honestly I couldnt stand myself. I felt like a whole different person was running my life while I sat quietly aside and watched.
when I first started taking this medication I was still having some crying episodes I spoke with my doctor about this and he raised the amount that I take on a daily basis and all is well in life again. The only side effects that I have seen is that I have to take this medication no earlier than an hour prior to me needing to sleep because it makes me very drowsy, but for once I sleep all night!

I knew I had panic attacks but they were small but seemed to be getting worse. About a week ago I ended up calling 911 bc i thought i was dieing. I have never ever felt like that before and growing up in such a horrible conditions I learned to be tough and could always handlt the small panic episodes or depression. They gave me ativan at the hospital and then I went to see a regualr metal health doctor. Im not on .5mg of xanax 3 times a day (or as needed), seems like i only end up taking 2 whole pills bc i break them in half. Im also on cymbalta 30mg for the first week then I will be on 60mg. The biggest side affect is how tired Iam. Ive stopped drinking any caffeine bc of fear it will make me jittery on the meds and worsen the panic. I cant even stay awake at work or driving. I feel really out of it but i understand this happens when you start new meds. When i was younger i was put on zoloft just for depression and stopped taking it after 3 days bc it made me so sick. The docs say I have a chemical embalance. Im only 24. Will I be like this forever? If love to find some message boards or support groups for this kinda thing.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! When I read your review, I felt like I was reading my own story -- down to the previous and ""now"" clothes sizes! And I too have been very careful about what I've been eating -- low fat, lots of vegies -- and exercising at least 5 times a week for an hour each time! To make matters worse, all the docs I've seen -- including two endocrinologists, my GP, my oncologist and my radiation oncologist -- all blamed the weight gain on the same thing -- ""well, you know you're getting older and going through menopause!"" By the last doc I talked to who looked at me once again as if to say ""yeah, well you really are eating more than you say you are,"" I was ready to jump across the desk and choke him, until...he said you know you're on three meds that can cause you to gain weight...neurontin, tamoxifen and Cymbalta. He didn't mean to, but he gave the the answer I was looking for! I can't stop taking the neurontin or tamoxifen, but I'm weaning myself off of the Cymbalta. Thanks Veronica for making me feel, well...sane!"

My list of side effects included: nausea, dizziness, disconnectedness, feeling like nothing mattered and nothing was enjoyable, warm and tingly skin, extreme lethargy to the point of having to lie down several times during the day. If the symptoms were all physical, i would have stuck it out hoping they would go away. But, I couldn't stand the feeling of disconnectedness and loss of joy in the activities that usually lift my spirits. My dr. added a low dose of Cymbalta to the Wellbutrin I was already taking as I was still getting depressed occasionally. But, I can't stand to feel this way, so I'm requesting that I just up my dose of Wellbutrin since it seems to work pretty well for me.

There was not nearly enough information provided to me regarding
 side effects. I am someone who actually reads the pamphlet that the pharmacist gives you.  No where to be found are the severe impact it can have on your weight. Over time, and I have been on it approximately 18 months.  Upon further investigation on my part, I have found that cymbalta actually enters your fat cells and STAYS THERE! OVER TIME the weight creeps on and on.  To top that off are the severe side effects when you are trying to ween yourself off of it.  For example, I have  gained 15 POUNDS in the two weeks while trying to eliminate cymbalta from my life. Not to mention the other awful side effects: brain zaps, mood swings, high blood pressure, urge to urinate one second & not making it to the bathroom the next, diahrea, joint pain, brain fog, adema, slurred speech and others. Think twice before using this drug. In the 18 months that I have been taking it I have gained 34 pounds. On a 5'1"" frame thats another whole person practically. I was in a size 6-8 petite, and now I am busting out size 16's.
Talk about a reason to be depressed!!! It's been 17 days and the brain zaps are almost gone and I am ""starting"" to feel like myself again-except for the weight gain. If I was eating carbs, sweets, etc. that would be one thing. But I follow a high protein, high vegetable diet.  Really consider the consequences."

4222$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/27/2008 8:23:30 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was prescribed 30 mg daily for anxiety.  I took the 1st pill at 8 p.m. by 11 p.m. I was restless, by 12 p.m. I had agonizing body pain, joint pain, muscle pain in my hands, lower back, both hips, fronts and backs of thighs, both ankles, tops and bottoms of both feet, fuzzy head, almost headache like. Anxiety. Went on for four hours.  Was able to finally fall asleep for 4 hours, woke in a haze, extremity pains were gone.  Had lower back ache, and aching in buttocks, and thighs off and on throughout the day.  Head remained achy and fuzzy throughout the day.  Spent the day in bed dealing with how horrible I felt.  Took until this morning (36 hrs) to feel like the effects of the medicine were out of my body.  The nausea was the easiest side effect to deal with, the body pain was horrendous.  Called my doc, threw out the meds. Extrememly disappointed in this med. I was unable to find these side effects mentioned on their site, that was also very disappointing.  The pain was scary.  I would have appreciated knowing from their site that this was a possibility.

For the first two weeks I was on Cymbalta (1st week 30 mg, 2nd week 60 mg, now on 90 mg), I felt like I was in a complete haze. After about a year, the only side effect I still notice is lack of sex drive, however for me this is a small price to pay in return for such major positive changes in my suicidal depression and severe anxiety.

I went to the ER due to this,and they told me that people are not always told to take it easy when your body is adjusting to it. My blood pressure went up and was then put on medication for anxiety. I was on cymbalta for 4 mths and had experienced extreme energy, but was still feeling down. When I was taken off of it, it took my body some time to withdrawl.

This medication was effective in reliving my pain and maybe my depression but it lead to severe anxiety attacks terrible dreams leading to sleepless nights.Weight gain,severe constipation which lead to my being in the hospital. I began to become very very short of breath which again lead to the hospital and a dx of Congestive heart failure,swelling of hands ,ankles,and inability to lay down with out coughing to death; which lead to my being placed on two other medications. Now that all this has become too much to bear I am taking my self off Cymbalta.Lord help me find the strength within to survive this terrible withdrawing nightmare..There is a severe sensitivity to movement; sound ; than  there comes the hallucinations; fear of sleep;periods of crying your heart out but not knowing why along with  heart palpitations;intense neuropathic pain and fleeting thoughts of slitting your wrists just to end the torture.I Have lost 2 days work thus far and maybe even more judging from today.Thank God for my very loving daughter and boy friend.. at this point it is for them that I will NOT  
give in. Please read every ones words, find strength in them as I have because I will tell you one thing for sure your Doctor does not have the answers! Do not give up ! Get off Cymbalta and never ever look back.  "

But after a battle with another drug that made the depression more exaggerated I finally confided in my doctor.  He prescribed Cymbalta 30 mg.  At first I had a roller coaster of side effects one of which was the lack of orgasm.  ( If anything I was a bit quick on the draw prior to Cymbalta). I asked my doctor on the 2 week return checkup about the minor side effects and the orgasm issue.  He said not to be quick to decide and that the side effects should subside. It has now been over 90 days and the orgasm has returned but it just takes a bit more time to reach it. My wife thinks that this is now a good side effect along with the new emotional stability, that was out of control.  I had major mood changes at the drop of the hat.  Not anymore.  We have a new relationship.  ( One Crazy Little pill).

Since I've started Cymbalta I've only had 2 real migraines.  Everything else has been controled w/ otc pain relievers!  Cymbalta has been a Godsend for me.  I did experience some dry mouth and stomach upset the first few weeks.  I also have sleepless nights that are normally remedied with some otc sleep meds or benedryl.

I was only on this for a week and a half before having to be taken off. I had horrible insomnia - I only slept about a total of 10 hrs in that week and a half. It did nothing for pain (but I wasn't on it for long enough to really see if it worked) I was so tired all the time and had to miss a few days of work. I also had some shortness of breath and was dizzy.

Cymbalta was good for keepping the depression under contol, however, there were two side effect that were unbearable.  The first side effect was constipation.   I could not have a movement without assistance for the whole 3 months.  The second side effect was sexual.  It was near impossible for me to ejaculate.

After extensive disucssion with my Doctos, I dedcided to remain on the drug during the holiday season as I thought it would not be a good idea to switch meds during the holidays.

After the New Year came about, my dosage was reduced from 60mg to 30mg.  Within 48 hrs of this reduction I was able to have a bowel movement naturally (hallelujah!!)!  In addition, my sexual side effects went away.

I am off of Cymbalta now and on Welbutrin XL.  I have no Constipation or sexual side effects from this medication.

Eventhough Cymbalta was able to control my depression, constipation and sexual side effects over rulled and am happy to switch my meds to Welbrutin XL.

The only complaint I have are the ""brain zaps"" that I get if I am late taking my next dose.  Its like someone whacks you on the head and you want to wince. Its really annoying! It definately is a reminder to me that I need to take the next pill, so I never miss a day...It takes about 2 hours after taking the next pill for the ""zaps"" to go away. I have also recently noticed that Im having trouble focusing my eyes when reading something closer to my face. Im not sure I can blame it on the Cymbalta because I have been taking it for about 3 yrs., although about 6 months ago I increased my dosage from 60mg.a day in the am, to adding 30mg at night to try to keep the ""Zaps"" away. Im backing off my dosage now to 30mg in the am and 30mg in the pm to still keep a more constant blood level in my system to keep the ""zaps"" away, and see if the lower dose makes a difference in the eyesight focusing issue.

I am also on other drugs for these things, steroids and pain meds, and I really did not see a difference after starting Cymbalta, in my pain levels. It did seem to straighten out my emotional responses to the difficulties of managing these conditions while still trying to live a life. But there is a very noticeable letdown if I take it later or forget to take it at all, and that leaves me worse off than if I weren't taking it - very depressed and nasty. I have gone down to half doses trying to get off it (not liking to be a test subject, as well as some side effects, weight gain, urination problems, sweating, etc.) but then broke 3 ribs and was so desperate for pain relief, I went back to full dose (60 mg.) and have been afraid to cut back again yet, though I want to. I want to be off it completely. The broken ribs was the worst pain I have ever had in my life, and lasted the longest, (months), and if the cymbalta helped with that, I did not notice it. I also have very major sleep issues but did not know this was a side effect. I also sweat huge, very huge amounts (like just coming out of the shower)... I do like the emotional assistance, because my life has been extremely difficult with the onset of all these conditions together, a few years ago, but I hate almost everything else about it, and still plan to wean myself off it for good. I do not think enough is known about this type of drug. I would rather be on the older drugs where their full range of actions and long term side effects are well known. This is my brain I am messing with by taking these pills. Who known if it will or can recover to a normal, pre-drug state, once I go off it? I don't think the answer to that is known.

All was well for about six months; now I'm suffering from renewed depression, panic and anxiety attacks, temper issues, and dizziness and ""zaps.""

I took Zoloft for about 3 yrs and felt those same things, well all but the sleeping a lot. I couldn't sleep, so the doc put me on something called Trazadone, which at last count I've been on for over 6 yrs. Now it seems like when I take the cymbalta at night i also have to take the trazadone. Am I taking too much? I also take the wellbrutrin in the morning! I have also felt run down, like I'm not getting enough sleep, My hubby said that if he let me I could sleep 24 hours get up for an hour and go back to sleep for 24 more! Doc said that this is normal.

I was on 60 mg for only two days, could not take the ""acid"" trip high. The whole month of January I was not on anything, as I figured my insurance would not cover 2 scripts in one 30 day span. (foolish thinking). Anyway, I started the lowest dosage 3 days ago, (20mg) and I guess I really have to give it time. Thank you to all you out there who take time to write reviews, one in particular which says that the side effects DO go away was very encouraging to me. They haven't been as bad as the 60's I was on, but I still feel a slight ""buzz"". I had a really hard time falling asleep last night, which stinks, because I work VERY early in the morning. I can tolerate the buzz for now, and I am really hopeful it will go away soon. I have no appetite, but force myself to eat, and then it's fine, once I get that first bite in my mouth. I really don't need to loose any weight, even 10 pounds would make me too thin.My husband says in 3 days I am calmer, not picking at everyone about making too much noise,(what do I expect from 2 boys,aged 16 & 12 and a husband?) and doing chores, so I guess the men in my house are happier so far!!"

Just an hour after taking Cymbalta on my first day, I felt very anxious, nervous my heart was jumpy. I tried relaxing in bed anything that was calming. Nothing worked I actually got worse. I felt soooo high i couldn't believe it. I had no energy i couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't sleep though either. I layed in bed til dawn tossing and turning. If i did drift off to sleep it was brief. I would start to fall asleep and I would see scary, evil looking faces that i couldn't really make out. It was so scary that I would wake up and feel even more anxiety. I have had the shakes for hours now, no appetite and a very bad headache. It's been over 12 hours and I still feel horrible.

I tried Elavil, trazadone, zoloft, paxil, prozac, wellbutrin, lexapro, and effexor with no real help. I started taking Cymbalta and in less than 2 weeks, I lost 12 pounds. I went into what was recognized by my doctor as a manic phase.I couldn't sleep at night, which made the manic phase worse. My symptoms of rapid cycling lasted for about 6 weeks, which can be exhausting when it's over. The ride back down is ten times worse than the depression I had been dealing with over the last few years.  I had only had an episode of mania once before this, so with this second episode, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I used the websites tools to track my moods and meds. It is a very helpful tool to use to communicate with the doctor. This was the first medication that I used that helped my depression, but be careful. If you are bipolar and don't know it, this medication can really bring it on. Also, be extra careful taking this medication with Ambien. I was on the two and started sleepwalking 4 or 5 nights a week. I also had very vivid nightmares and lots of waking up soaked in sweat. This is a very good medication when used appropriately. As with any medication like this, give it at least 3 weeks before deciding it is not working.

4319$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$1/21/2008 2:46:17 PM$Reviewer: cloudyZZ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$4$I have been on cymbalta for 2 months.  I have extreme dry mouth, heart racing, blood pressure went up, put on 10lbs,no orgasams&no interest in sex(this is a big deal). I started on 30mg then the doctor raised me to 60mg even though I had those symptoms at 30mg Why raise the dose? Hes the doctor so I went with it. I did like the fact that I didn't fly off the handle with my kids and was able to remain calm with them. I began to feel sleepy more often and was sleeping during the day with my 4 year old asking me to get up and feed her lunch. I have not shown up at school functions that I was schedule for or take my daughter to preschool where I have to help teach there from time to time-the feeling was I just didn't want to go I rather cuddle up on the comfy chair with a blanket. Now I told my doctor this 6 days ago about all of this. Did I mention I also take Lunesta to sleep at night because I can't sleep this Cymbalta doesn't help me sleep either(doc recommended I take it at night before bed to help me sleep. I have now went off of this cymbalta for the last 3 nights. Doc will be mad but hey hes not listening!! I had some headaches,dizzy not bad but I already feel like having sex and can enjoy IT!!YEAH. Not sleeping during the day. I felt like cleaning my house again again and participating at school. Is this the right drug for me I don't think so but it may work for you. Watch your symptoms and hopefully your doctor will listen and you decide am I feeling better? Have your spouse or significant other tell or ask you how do you feel today? or get their insight on how you have been acting they are a big help too!! Good luck--feel better.

While the medication was effective in treating my depression, the side effects were unacceptable. While taking Cymbalta, I experienced a slow, but steady, weight gain. I gained over 25 lbs during the year I was taking it. I began to have problems with urination. I would feel the almost uncontrollable urge to go, rush to the bathroom, only to experience a very long extended urination. The urine stream would be a trickle. I could not get ""pressure"" in my urine stream. Often I would think I was finished, then start again without warning. My sex drive was severely affected. My wife began to complain that I wasn't interested in sexual activity. The truth is, I didn't even realize it, because sex didn't cross my mind. On the occasions I was able to perform, ejaculation was physically painful. I went to my doctor and discussed my concerns. He prescibed 25 mg Paxil CR. Now, I am happy to report I feel great, my appetite is normal, my urination problems have ceased and I once again have a healthy sex drive."

Going on cymbalta helped me get over the fear of being in a place other than the safe haven of my home.  I found the side effects were relatively strong like sweating.  But it's a small price to pay to be able to get your life back in order.  I went off of it over a year ago and haven't had to go back.  I still sometimes get nervous and anxious about situations but find myself able to talk myself out of becoming sick.  Definately would recommend this drug to anyone with anxiety!"

I attempted suicide after my son was born and was put on Lexapro.  I fell like the Lexapro did absolutely nothing for me, except make me angry.  Cymbalta has been like a godsend.  I have only been on it about a month but I have felt such a remarkable change in myself.  I am happier, have more energy and have an overall better view on life.  I've have nausea, tremors, and loss of appetite but it is all worth it.

I know feel like going out and doing things I didn't want to do before. I didn't want to believe I was depressed I thought I could handle everything on my own. The job I'd wanted all my life had turned into something I hated getting up to get ready to go do everyday. Now I'm loving my job again. Cymbalta has gave me my life back.

I have had several spinal surgeries/one fusion @ L5-S1 disc space and I also suffer from facet joint disease, osteoarthritis and for some unknown reason my body produces excess scar tissue which has wrapped itself around the nerves. OUCH! My doctor started me out at 30mg which worked great within the first week on my depression. I noticed an improvement in my moods by the end of that 1st week. After 4 months of being on 30mg my depression is under control, but there was no change in the pain, so last week my doctor increased my dosage to the next level of 60mg daily. I have been on it now for one week, no side effects at all. But I won't judge the level of effectiveness on my pain for at least another week or two, I always like to give a new medication the proper amount of time to work before judging it's effectiveness. I know sometimes it may take up to a month before you actually feel the full benefits of a medication, so I have learned to be patient. I have lived with chronic pain for the last 18 years now, so waiting a few weeks for what seems to be a promising result is worth it. I have heard nothing but wonderful things about Cymbalta for chronic pain patients, hopefully I will be one of the lucky ones that it works on. Like all people, medications are different and may not work on everyone. There is no magic pill out there, we can only hope that we may be one of the ones that the medication works on. So far, Cymbalta is working and I hope it keeps working on the pain. I will give an update in a few weeks after the appropriate time has elapsed for testing. Wish me luck, I wish everyone else who tries Cymbalta luck and success.

For those of us who are drug resistant a higher dose, 60mg, and giving it a good 6 weeks to really work is key.  Also stay away from alcohol, it really negates the effect.

My insurance would not cover two dosages a day, but they would cover one dosage a day, so I got the 60mg. I took one when I first came home with my script, about 5:30pm Sat night, and only slept 4 hours that night. I was feeling like I was having a bad acid trip, but I took my second one Sunday morning anyway. Yuck. While I could feel that I was better in my head, not so worried over stupid stuff, etc,etc, I was very jumpy inside, and was seeing trails from moving objects.I barely ate the whole day,smoked a million cigarettes and spent it worring about coming down off this unpleasant high. Suprisingly, I slept a full 8 hours last night, thankfully, and feel better today, as i will not take it today. I am a caffeine junkie, and while I tried to stay away from it yesterday, I had a cup of coffee already this morning, and I don't think that was a good idea. If a lower dosage does not work for me, I will go back to zoloft, as I had no problems taking that. My husband says to give the cymbalta a couple weeks, but there is NO WAY I could deal with the ""high"".I have to work today for a few hours, I think I feel ok to drive, but yesterday no way would I have gotten behind the wheel."

Since then life has thrown me a few major curve balls, which I truely believe I survived because of my treatment with Cymbalta. My aunt also is treated with Cymbalta for diabetic nerve pain and is impressed with it.

I switched to Cymbalta and immediatly stopped having panic attacks, but it did take several months to have decreased side effects.  My major side effects included waking up several times a night and night sweats.  The side effects actually got better when my doctor increased my dosage from 30 mg to 60 mg a day.  My only real side effect now is sleepiness - especially in the morning.  My panic attacks were so debilitating that I am just so greatful to not have them anymore - even with the mild side effects.

But NEVER totally get off of it if you have been at a high dosage for a year or more, I thought the world was coming to an end, crying etc.  Then I took a 75mg from my Psy and in a couple hours I was ok.  The Cymbalta I started 8 months ago was a 60mg pill by my family Dr. replacing the 150mg Effexor XR (Burn out or tolerance) and the change over was no problem and it did benefit I think, it's hard to tell.  So...I wnet to a Psychiatrist and he doubled the Cymbalta to 120 mg.  That seemed to do the trick!  He mentioned the 60mg max was not helping his patients so he conferred with other Psych's and they said their patients did well with taking 2 of the 60mg Cymbalta's.  In addition, I take Clonazepam 1mg after work and 2 mg at night for teeth grinding.  If I son't have it at night I WON'T sleep.  So be careful.  It's like Xanax but last longer and the effect comes on much slower than Xanax.  Good Luck with your depression.  Remember, it's a brain chemical imbalance, NOT YOU!  I got it from my father's side of the family.  He's depressed all the time and won't take anything just like his father and his father's father committed suicide.  So...it's not a weakness, it's a disease.  Remember that!
God Bless you all!"

This is the first that has been effective in moderating deep depression to a liveable level eliminating suiidal feelings, and importantly severe anger.  The side effects have been some blurring of visibility at night, some memory loss and MOST IMPORTANT a drug interaction with Detrol (urology related). As strange as it sounds, this caused STAGGERING!! I had the full work-up becuase it was thought to be related to recent brain surgery ( EEG, EMG etc. ) but it ws as simple as stopping the Detrol and continuing with Cymbalta. Wierd! 

I cannot emphasize enough checking these interactions with your pharmacist;doctors dont really pay attention to drug interactions.

On balance, this is a fantastic drug, even with the side effects. But I do wonder how long it will last. Straterra lasted one year. "

I went back to the Dr. who said the drug couldn't possible be responsible for all of the symptoms and since it had worked so well in the beginning I just needed my dose upped, which he did and the side effects stayed the same.  Coming off the drug was total hell, add to the above symtoms vertigo.  I was in a fog for a while.  I am currently trying natural supplements, exersice, accupuncture, music therapy and I am actually starting to feel good. I have my good days and bad days but I am finally starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. What actually funny is I started taking this drug for slight depression and anxiety at the urging of my psychologist.  Needless to say, I should have worked out those issues without the help of antidepressants, I will never, ever, ever, take something like these drugs as lightly as I did.  Good luck!

I am 20 years old and have been struggling with depression, generlized axiety, and ADD. I have been on different medications for 3 years. I've been on pretty much every anti-depressant. I know regret my decision to take cymbalta. I thought this would be the last trial of anti-d's. My previous medications weren't allowing me to reach my potential, but have never had symptoms like Cymbalta. I am on 90 mg of Cymbalta everyday for over 8 months. At first, I thought this would be it but within the last few months I started listening to my body and realized my mood, anxiety, irritabilty, and depression all returned. As well as, other side effects. I knew cymbalta just wasnt the answer and didnt refill my prescription. Although my doctor warned me of the withdrawl from cymbalta and I had no idea it would be the worst feeling of my life. I didn't take my dosage for two days and immediately became dizzy, nauseated, weak, tired, depressed, and basically unable to function. My doctor told me to get back on it and gave me samples for the time being. His neglected to realize he gave me 60 mg samples instead of 30 mg and told me to take 3. I was so completely out of it that I took three. I woke up from a nap and started vomitting and only then did I figure out I had ODed on cymbalta, which didn't help my withdrawl. I have never felt this way before, i thought i was going to die. I told my doctor that i was uncomfortable taking cymbalta and realized it wasnt working anymore. The doctor still has me on 90 mg a day and I want to get off. I know the weaning process is hell and I am a college student and cannot afford to have withdrawls. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know.

In Sept. of 2005, I was hospitalized and taking many drugs to control my condition.  Trying to find another drug to compliment my regime was difficult, but my hospital assigned psychiatrist asked me to try Cymbalta.  I have difficulty with many drugs (side effects), but I was so happy when the doctor gave me Cymbalta!!  It gave me my life back!!!  The hovering blackness disapated and I felt alive again.  Thank God for Cymbalta.  Very, very few side effects.  It's been two (2) years now and I am still taking Cymbalta.  My condition has deteriorated (I am now on Social Security Disability) but Cymbalta will remain a stable of my ""cocktail"" of drugs. It still gives me the great stablizing I need.  

My only concern is that they don't provide Cymbalta in liquid form.  I have had a gastric bypass and can now take the capsules, but I will soon be having a revision to my bypass and would need a liquid since I won't be able to swallow the capsules.  I'm hoping I will be able to break open the capsules and take with applesauce or something soft.

Try Cymbalta if it is recommended to you...it will give you your life back!

Good luck... "

In the beginning things seemed to be progressing decently but they have steadily declined ever since though my dosage is constantly increased.  The drug isn't difficult so much to take.  I'm disgruntled and say it's hard to use because of the stupid way they've got me set up on it.  I'm at 180mg a day: 120 in the morning and 60 at night.  It would have been much easier to give me a huge bottle of 60mg'ers and take 2 in the morning... but, NO.  So now, for bacially one prescribed drug I have two separate prescriptions: 120mg and 60mg: paying twice for what I should only have to pay once.  Ripoff!

At this point I'd rather go back to my old AD, Celexa.  No, that didn't work either (obvious due the change to Cymbalta) but at least I didn't have the dosage/prescription hassle.

It may, or may not, have also contributed to a definitive spike in my anxiety, psychosis, and paranoia.  As the Cymbalta increased, Seroquel also became necessary to take (yet another drug that also isn't working... got a post there too).

Many times I feel like I'd rather just not have any at all.  Sure, nothing would be better but at this point I wouldn't be any worse off.  And at the very least I'd not be paying for overpriced medication that hasn't done anything more than a glass of water can do!"

So, I have a smile on my face now. I have to admit, I noticed the problem when I was crying for no reason and becoming angry a while back.

4768$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/23/2007 11:29:22 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I recommend this drug for anyone else who has been unsuccessful with other SSRIs (Zoloft, Paxil).  I experienced a bit of nausea the first two days, but have felt no remaining side effects since.  Also, unlike the SSRIs, I have experienced no weight gain - thank goodness!

I recommend Cymbalta but it is best to take it daily without missing even a day.  Try to take it at the same time everyday.

I feel that it did help more for this issue than a lot of other meds I have been on,(I am very med resistant), but it wasn't the best I've been on. It didn't really have a significant impact on my suicidal ideations, or self harm though. Around the first 2 weeks I was taking this medication, I was hospitilized for major depression, and Dellusional/Disassociative thinking.

Prozac has worked fine for most of these years with no side effects.  My MS doctor changed me to cymbalta for the nerve pain, she also kept me on noretryptylin as she said the two work fine together...Well...I ended up trying to commit suicide and was on life support for several days for seratonin syndrome.  The combination caused too much seratonin which causes a life theatining condition....suicide!!!

I also have mitral valve prolapse syndrome and I believe it has help alleviate some of those symptoms.

It has worked great for both.  With the addition of wellbutron sr, I have felt emotionally better than I have in years.  I would recommend it to any one to try.  You have nothing to lose, but depression or neuropathy.

While this drug does an ok job it scary when you decide to get off of it. YOu body will go through a variery of withdraw symptoms EVEN if you slowly dose down. I took this due to crazy life changes. Now that I am okay I want to stop taking it but it has been an up hill battle... uncontrolable crying dizzy, nausa, brain zaps ( trust me if you stop taking it you will understand)
