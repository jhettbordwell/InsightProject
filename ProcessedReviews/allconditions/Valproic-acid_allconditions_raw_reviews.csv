I have since stopped taking both but while I was on them both I was very uncomfortable and I was far more mentally unstable. I was very aggressive and lethargic.

While escitalopram isn't listed as one of the drugs it can react with I would still say to be careful with it. At the time I was under 18 and I'd approximate about 130lbs, and 5'2"" if that helps. Sex is female."

8$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$8/14/2014 5:45:36 PM$Reviewer: $5$5$5$"I could write a novel on Rx Bi-polar meds after dealing with bi-polar for over 20 yrs.  The true issue is preventing manic episodes.  Valproic is one of only 3 meds that do that well, and also stop them during a manic phase.  The meds work great for both!  I have been on and off them due to side effect concerns.  They are NOT good for your liver.  Your liver is a super organ that does so many things for you.  I have been off this med for over a year now.  I have no depression and no manic episodes.  Getting ALL nutrients, exercise, adequate sleep and avoiding STESS is key.  Bi-polar is not a disease, it is a nutrient deficiency that causes imbalances in neurotransmitters!  People dealing with ""bi-polar"" need ALL nutrients and it will go away.  These meds are invaluable to bring a manic episode under control, however, they due not ""cure the disease"".  The cure is nutrients...ALL of them!  The key nutrients for the neurotransmitters for bi-polar are: FOLATE (Not, absolutely not folic acid! Never consume folic acid!!), CHOLINE, IRON, B6, B12 all amino acids, & MAGNESIUM. Research on the net food sources for them, and consider supplements.  However, 99% of all ""vitamin supplements"" are not vitamins.  Even the ones at health food stores!  They are pharmaceutical grade analogs (PGA's).  They are horrible for your body, cause cancer, and do not work in the same way as REAL vitamins from REAL food.  If you research PGA's and how they make them and from what you will be horrified!  Do not put them in your body!  Instead, research ""real food source vitamin supplements"" and choose a good one.  The one I selected is from Sunwarrior company because it had the adequate levels and correct ratios of B vitamins.  I make a shake every morning with Gold Standard Whey protein powder, Twinlabs brewer's yeast, Spirulina, 1cup oatmeal softened in hog water, 1 frozen bannana, empty the herbs & supplements caps into it.  I eat only whole, non-gmo, real food. That's all nutrients in a glass!"

Those who have taken Depakote on the East Coast should be careful when changing to this ""generic"" - same for the klonopin I was taking - it changed to a green rather than blue pill in the West (Colorado).

I intend to see a neurologist immediatly to be taken off this drug. I have had epilepsy since i was twelve, and many types of drugs. I have all three types of epilepsy, and now reaching towards 50, and never going any length of time without seizures, one neurologist increased the dosage...and i didnt have the sense god gave me to look this drug up. If your doctor suggests putting you on this drug, ask for an alternative, i currently take 1250mg in morning and at night, as well as lamactogine and lorazepam.

70$Condition: Bipolar Disorder in Remission$4/17/2010 3:27:40 PM$Reviewer: jane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on this medication for 14 years and find it a great mood stabilizer.  I am never manic but find depression is an ongoing problem.  It also helps with chronic headaches which I used to get.  I find I have put some weight on but it was needed because I was underweight.  
71$Condition: Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy$11/18/2008 9:02:41 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Sodium valproate,along with a very healthy lifestyle;(alcohol free,daily exercise,low stress,regular sleeping patterns and a nutritious diet),has allowed me to be siezure free for more than a year. I do experience drowsiness,blurred vision and confusion; or perhaps more accurately put,an inability to turn thoughts into actions as efficiently as i used to. On the whole though these side effects are easy to accept and deal with, as opposed to having grand mal siezures and suffering the head injuries that inevitably come with them. I would recommend this drug for anyone requiring it,in close consultation with a good G.P., if you are lucky enough to have one avaliable to you. best of luck and peace to all.

77$Condition: Epileptic Seizure$11/25/2017 3:55:26 AM$Reviewer: Erika G., 13-18 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$1$4$I love that it worked for me and helped prevent any future seizures for my epilepsy, but I got a couple of the weirdest side effects from this medication not even listed on here. One of the symptoms I had that I know that were already reported included anxiety and sometimes depression, but the strangest one I had was very irrational and violent behavior, and I'm not talking about typical and common temper tantrums, as I was only 9 years old taking this; this behavior of mine included actual tantrums out of nowhere and with no apparent cause, writing stories about death, playing violent online games while laughing at it, and casually talking about death at the dinner table--all without me realizing doing it. I've even attempted to run away from home and cause self-harm on myself. Luckily, my mom immediately got me off this medication. At the time, I was also showing obvious signs of autism, but today, I am now considered on the spectrum--higher functioning. I know what happened to me back then, and I know it sounds like fiction just from a drug causing all this odd behavior, but it happened. It still scares me to this day, and I don't know what the heck triggered it, but at least I need to know it's all in the past and over with. The only thing I'm still concerned about it is exactly WHAT caused this rare behavior, but I'm not trying to think about it too much. I know this drug has been giving some patients behavior problems, but mine was definitely weird and abnormal behavior. Wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is likely to have a mood/other mental problems.

79$Condition: Other$10/14/2015 11:07:46 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$2$It was a pill so ease of use was typical.  Not a huge horse pill but not small and extremely simple to swallow.  I walked in docs office and within 1 minute of me being in the room she decided to prescribe this medication.  She did not test me and non of my tests in my 47 years of life mentioned me being bipolar.  At the time I was on low dose of generic adderal.  I was actually feeling good.  Seeing this doc was at the request of family doc to regulate anxiety meds. I expressed my discomfort vehemwntly... she was condescending and demanded I give it a try.  I have been all screwed up since.  While taking the Depakote I hade mega migraines, slept constantly, totally ignored my daughter and the rest of my life... I did not care.  I was depressed.  My acid reflux that had completely gone away while on the affexor was back in spades.  Also was my diarhia.  My skin crawled like something was trying to get out.  I heard things that were not there.  My dreams were all kinds of scary to creepy.  These symptoms started slow and just got worse and worse.  I let the doc know, her answer was always to give it time.  My family doc and pharmacist stayed that after two weeks I should see improvement not feeling worse more and more.  When I had 2 or 3 pills left from the 30 day bottle I had had enough... I hated missing so much time with my daughter among other things.  The doc had one of her nurses call me and tell me to continue with these pills again and I told the nurse that I was not continuing. She said she would talk to doc..and when she got back with me the nurse said the doc really wanted me to continue.  I said I am not seeing her again I want to see another doc.  I quit taking them started feeling so very much better almost immediately but it has been about 6 months and I still feel some residual affects.  What did this medication do to me?  I am scared.

Only answered q.2 b/ci it was required. Would very much like to know if this would-be a good candidate for treating my manic episodes. Usually in fits and spurts, a good estimate would be 6 manic episodes per year max. They are however, lengthy and a pain to my husband and son as well, that they endure somehow... I take klonapin in a small dose every day as a means to help my mind wind-down and generally relax enough to fall asleep within 30 min or less rather then the 2-3 hours it normally can take. I also take fiorinal w/ codeine to combat stress-related migraines I suffer from at least once per week. I take that only when headache/migraine persists. What might be the best prescription drug to add to this carefully concocted cocktail of medications so far.
