1$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$11/6/2016 3:28:03 PM$Reviewer: Gina, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I have a very high tolerance to medication but after 1mg morning and night of Fanapt I felt completely horrible. I thought I might be catching the flu or something but then I realized it was the medicine. It made me feel so out of it. I was drowsy, slow moving and thinking, felt like I was going to faint when I got up and walked around, got headaches, my heart kept racing which made my anxiety worse. I was surprised how strong this medication effected me in such a short time and small dose. Not for me!
2$Condition: Other$4/25/2016 9:38:58 PM$Reviewer: Chris, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$When I was ready to give up on medicine all together, I decided why not give this a try my doctor put me on all of the most expensive antidepressants and anti-psychotics for ocd. All of them did not work.I decided to give this medicine a try , I remember taking it long time ago. The only side effect I noticed is weight gain , which can be managed with diet and exercise. Within in days I noticed improvement.

5$Condition: Other$1/19/2015 3:43:37 PM$Reviewer: lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$2$5$I have been taking this medication for 12 days now. My voices are almost gone. I still eye some things. The one side affect that I am having is sleeping about 2/3 of the time. People say that I look extremely tired or they say I look like a zombie. After being awake about 15 minutes I feel like i need to sleep. I hate living this way.

7$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/30/2014 4:37:55 PM$Reviewer: Moe, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"This is the most awful medication on the market that can be used to treat bipolar disorder. It is an 'atypical' which is generally not prescribed for this however my doc wanted to try it since other RX weren't having much effect. The side effects were overwhelming with racing heart rate, low blood pressure, muscle aches, fatigue, drowsiness and dizziness being the worst. One major reason I stopped is because of the potential increase in aggression. I'm a competitive athlete and naturally aggressive and I do not want my aggression to become worse or violent. I've already injured myself prior to taking Fanapt due to my natural 'safe' aggressive behavior and recklessness but I do not want it to become a problem of violence where I could hurt others.

One other side effect that can affect athletes or people who exercise regularly is the abnormal rise in heart rate. My resting heart rate is between 40-50 which is very low. I noticed that my heart races to approximately 120 beats per minute or so just doing simple chores around the house. 120 beats per minute is normally a very vigorous workout for me so this is a crazy situation. Fanapt made exercise and training impossible.

Maybe this medication can help others who are resistant to the side effects however the cons outweigh the pros for me. This RX is a no go for me."
8$Condition: Other$9/28/2013 6:47:12 PM$Reviewer: Skylar, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$I experience depression, mania, psychosis, and anxiety, and this really takes the edge off. It hasn't been a cure but has been the only med that really made a difference for me and without horrible side effects. My left hand shakes a little, my mouth is dry, and it made me a little tired when I first started it but that is gone now. The pluses have been majorly decreased anxiety (less panic attacks), less hallucinations, and better depression. I also lost five pounds on this, which either means that I lost weight I gained on the previous med or Fanapt itself made me lose weight. I LOVE this stuff and it has turned me from a student failing all classes to one getting straight As. Fanapt changed my life!

10$Condition: Other$7/21/2013 12:14:39 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This is one of the only drugs that has ever helped me. I have been taking Fanapt since early in 2010. Most side effects listed don't impact my life as severely as my disorder did. My selling point was that I was able to lose 50 of the 80 pounds I gained because of other medications.

My 5 year old was prescibed this for his ADHD and ODD. My son was probably 50 lbs before. In a matter of months, he ballooned up to over 70 lbs. Now is is 76 lbs or more. We have him in baseball and it is not working much. The medication works well for calming him down and at each check up with the psychiatrist, his weight is more. He looks miserable and I feel awful at how heavy he has become. Its wonderful that it does what the dr wants it to, but I am not happy about the weight gain.

17$Condition: Schizophrenia$10/20/2012 12:15:30 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$2$5$I switched to Fanapt because I was experiencing TD with Latuda, and it was happening at my job.That immediately stopped when I started, but there have been some drawbacks. I had to get use to the lightheadness and the sedation I deal with is as bad as when I was on Geodon.This is my 5th medication change,so I don't know how many more options I have. There is no weight gain, so I guess I will try and figure out a plan to fight it. Same old battle, just new drug.
18$Condition: Schizophrenia$9/8/2012 2:12:40 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$5$I have been taking Fanapt for a week and half.  The side effects at first were horrible; dizziness, headache, fatigue, dry eyes and mouth, congestion, insomnia, etc.  I was switching from Latuda to the Fanapt and there was a little while when I was first on it that my symptoms came back (hallucinations and delusions mostly).  Now I'm to the point where I could handle the side effects I still have (dry eyes, mouth, congestion) except that my legs keep swelling pretty big.  I'm using Flonase for the congestion, which really helps.  My symptoms are under control but I have a feeling that when I see my psychiatrist they will want me to switch to something else.
19$Condition: Additional Medications to Treat Depression$5/1/2012 9:50:52 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I've been on Fanapt for several months now.  I am asking my doc to take me off of it.  It hasn't helped with my depression.  What's worse is that I've developed urinary incontinence which isn't listed in the side effects; however, when I researched it further, I learned it does cause incontinence in 10% of all cases.  I also am having moderate memory loss.  Maybe it will work for someone else, but it hasn't worked for me.
20$Condition: Schizophrenia$4/14/2012 9:52:26 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$5$I have been on this drug for some time now up to 4mg daily. I am not seeing any benefits with this drug. I still see things and people (I call Gremlins) but mostly at night, so I do not go out at night which limits me from some family and friends outings.
21$Condition: Other$3/26/2012 9:41:24 PM$Reviewer: Appalachian Girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I am using a trial pack to see if this med will help with the treatment of bi-polar disorder; and it is probably a little early to tell as far as the ratings go. Day 1 (1mg): I was light headed, dizzy, my heart pounded out of my chest and I had shortness of breath; I kept having to take frequent deep breaths as though to catch up.  Day 2 (2mg): I experienced all of the above x2, plus I woke up disoriented, staggering somewhat, my whole body felt like lead, very fatigued,I couldn't see well, because my eyes felt like they were swelled or like I could not open them all the way. I was very fatigued my friends said I looked ""flushed."" Day 3 (4mg): I took the morning dosage and felt like I was carrying lead shoes, had a large lead anvil setting on my chest, I literally felt like I was struggling to breathe. I thought I was going to die.  I have tried to drink caffiene throughout this trial..which has helped some, but each day I feel like I am pushing the button.  I am going to contact my dr about the dosage in the am. For the most part, I think I did feel better mentally-more calm and evened-out, if I didn't have the anxiety of thinking I was going to die! It is so frustrating finding the right ""cocktail"" of drugs that suites one's needs. I am keeping my fingers crossed."

When I first started taking it, I got very dizzy often, but that wore off. Soon afterwards, my doctor increased my dose. When the side effects abated, he increased it again, and then again. The worst side effects wear off after a little while each time. I have a dry mouth and nasal congestion still, but I'm very pleased with the results. Before I started FanApt, my husband thought I needed hospitalization. I continue to improve with each dosage increase, and I'm pleased with my ability to sleep, my activity level, and my improved mood.

I have not tolerated many other meds due to extreme side effects. Finished titration pack up to 6mg wth some side effects of dizziness and having alot of difficulty sleeping. Increased dose of 10mg caused increased anxiety and agitation,thus went back down to 6mg. Mania is controlled however and I'm happy with that.

I transitioned off of 45 mg of Zyprexa onto 12 mg of Fanapt per day.  At first I was way over medicated and felt sluggish and out of it for a couple of weeks.  But as I went down on the dosage of Zyprexa (which over 7 years had caused about 100 lbs of weight gain) I felt that my hallucinations and racing thoughts were under control on just the Fanapt.  I like taking the Fanapt as my constant hunger has disappeared.  I have lost over 30 lbs. in the 10 weeks I have been taking Fanapt.  I would highly recommend this medication as a replacement for Zyprexa - all the positive control of Zyprexa without the hunger!

As drugs wore off I have had to really take responsibility for my action in the past, most of which I was unaware of. Side effects and amens aside this drug is well worth taking!

This medicine has just turned me into according to my family when they see me, it looks like you are drunk. This medicine has totally messed with my sleep cycle in thatI am awake during the night and day time with very little sleep. If your body is sensitive to EPS (extrapyramidal syndrome) then please do not take this drug, it only makes it worse. And as for the whole bit about about being able to think clearer, don't believe it, it just made me more confused and I also feel very slow with my speech and verbal responses.
