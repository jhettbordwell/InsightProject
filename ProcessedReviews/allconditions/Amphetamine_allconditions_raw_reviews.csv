2$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/25/2019 10:02:18 PM$Reviewer: Galwaygirl, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$Been rx'd adhd meds since the 3rd grade. 20mg x 2 when I wake up. This has been the best by far for the longest too. Still have to be diligent in eating big breakfast bc no Appetite during day n blood sugar can drop but dnt have the crash after its worn off which many others can. Feels like it stays working steadily as it should from about 630am to 330-4pm. Does make ya have to #2 some mrngs when it first starts to kick in but nothing crazy. Important to take as prescribed or your sleep and eating will go downhill quick

It almost quit working altogether over the course of the next couple weeks. The following month my doc put me on the 20mg XR twice daily and now I've not had any negative side effects except for occasional insomnia. I definitely recommend the XR over IR.

I found it useful to reduce the dosage every few days or not take one at all. My biggest disappoint is that the XR doesn't extend the release that much slower than the standard pill.

I'm not Hyperactive, but that was the only choice I was given. I am so glad that I was diagnosed and I was able to start this medication The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars for effectiveness is because I think that I should be on the next higher dose! Taking this medication has turned my life around. Before my ADD caused so many problems in my home life that my wife and I almost split up. I had a lot of problems finishing things that I started or remembering to do something because my mind would wander. Now I am able to stay on task and finish what I start. I only wish that I would have been diagnosed with this problem about 40 years ago. I wonder how it would have changed my working career?

I have tried Many drugs over the years. The only thing that would help me before Adderall was Cylert. But Cylert is no longer a choice. When I first took Adderall I couldn't believe it. How I felt, how I communicated, how my attention span increased along with my focus. I just wish this drug was available to me growing up, would have made my life much easier. I take 20 mills. most days. There are some days I will not take any. Other than a little restless at night, I have had no side affects. I take no other medication and feel good now while understanding things more clearly.

This medication has been a life savor. I don't take it often bc I don't need it all the time but my husband has pointed out that I am a different person when I'm taking it.

16$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/2/2016 3:43:44 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$3$It works for me, my mood is more regulated, I can pay attention and I don't interrupt as much. However, I think it's important to realize that this drug won't make you a super student - It allows me the capacity to develop the habits of a good student that ADHD had prevented me from creating. I do find the XR doesn't last as long as promised, (currently on 20mg) so I take 5mg IR mid morning and 5mg in the afternoon. I rated it a lower usability scale, because getting a refill is a hassel. I have to pick up a physical paper prescription from my doctor's office to give to the pharmecy, then the pharmacy has to fill it and it takes longer because it is a controlled substance. It's a 2-3 hour ordeal sometimes.

First effective. But once your body adjusts, there is an up and down feeling through the day. Tired, awake, tired,awake. The second issue is that they dont last as long as it supposed to. If you have an early start to your work week, dont bother taking them until late morning. Even after diet changes,exercise,supplements, and restful night sleep, It is still a luck of the draw how effect the XR will work that day.

I don't find that the 25 mg is ""enough"" because I am still having trouble focusing, getting organized, etc.  I see that the ""maximum"" dose is 30 mg of the XR.  I am scared that if I go to the 30 mg, and it isn't enough, where do I go from there?  I need to have a conversation with my doctor to troubleshoot this.  I would recommend the Adderall if you need it, but be mindful of the ""mood swings.""  I do find it to help significantly with anger, and I am not sleepy during the day. "

Although i have read that there are a rather large number of side effects i have only experienced a lack in hunger and occasion difficulty to sleep (only on days when ive been late taking it). overall this drug has helped me significantly in school and general day to day life although i am concerned about the lack of knowledge in the long term use of this drug.

32$Condition: Other$5/28/2014 4:34:00 PM$Reviewer: Healthy5, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My doctor prescribed Adderall XR in 2006 after I'd lost both parents to cancer and was depressed. Today, it consistently helps me focus at work and be as productive as I can be with a positive attitude. I don't take it daily, only when I know I need to perform at a higher level. I truly do not feel addicted to it. I take it because I want to, not because I need to. No side effects. Shortly after taking, I feel like I'm able to accomplish whatever I set out to do. In high school my baseball coach told us that you should want the batter to hit the ball your way, because you are confident you'll make the play - every time. That's how Adderall XR makes me feel.

No significant increase in BP ( it went up a bit only by 3 pts ) and no heart issues except I am a couch potato ! This is a "" wonder drug "" for me since being diagnosed by 2 psychologists and a doctor on 2002. The main reason for all the professional people was my doctor making sure I was not faking Adult ADHD just to get "" speed "" for no good reason. My doctor told me there is almost a steady stream of junkies trying to hustle him for dope ( meds that are not needed ). I had to work close with my doctor to get the right dose. Look at it like a lone window on one side a garage. You want to get "" inside "" the window, not before it or after it. ADHD meds no good if either or. That may explain why many parents "" freak out "" when their kid gets actually worse. Adderall may not be right for all persons. With my 49 yr old brother, Ritalin works best. Hope this helps."

I knew this one little extended release pill wouldn't do what I needed it to do.  Like helping  me stay alert and be more focused. Be better able to concentrate, and focus on tasks at hand much easier, but I gave it a shot. Did gain a bit more energy to get things done, but still very exhausted and no motivation past two p.m.in the afternoon. So, around two pm I took another twenty milligrams And I felt far more focused, happy, outgoing and much more productive. All the anxiety ceased! For me, I think that I metabolize drugs so fast that whether it be an Extended or an immediate release, they both really just affect me the same. I don't feel any difference, except the ER make me a little irritated, so maybe just the immediate release is better, two or three times a day at 20mg or maybe 30mg, each dose.  Either way, the adderral helps tremendously! Couldn't live without it!

I have been taking Adderall XR 30mg twice a day (60mg) since 2010. Adderall makes me focus and concentrate on tasks that I felt lazy about before. Prior to taking this medication, I was unable to concentrate, felt very unmotivated, sluggish, and was doing poor at work which inevitably made me lose my job. Since taking Adderall XR, I am completing tasks on time, 100% motivated, I have more energy, and I'm able to focus. I have also been more punctual and nothing gets left undone. However, the side effects: This medication is very addictive. If you have an addictive personality, do not take it. You will be dependent on it and won't be able to function without it. Sometimes when the medication wears off I get moody and irritable. It's also good to take this medication very early as it will keep you up at night. I have to take other medications to help me sleep, otherwise I would be up for days, which has happened. (When I don't take my sleep meds.) This medication also decreases my appetite completely. I don't ever feel like eating anything until the medication wears off, and then I want to eat everything in site. I've also noticed that if you eat big meals while on Adderall, it takes away the effects of it. Also, I have tried other ADD medications, such as: Ritalin, Vyvanse, and Strattera and none of them work as well for me as Adderall.

For me it made it much easier to pay attention and complete tasks.. it makes everything seem so ""interesting."" I made much better grades in school. I was organized and well behaved. AS far as ADHD symptom, it pretty much eliminated them. However, Adderall has some side effects. I experienced rapid heart rate, higher blood pressure, extreme ""states of concentration"" (to the point where I could sit and do 500 math problems without stopping, without even wanting too), weight loss, and extreme mood swings. It made it impossible for me to sleep. It changes your personality and makes you extremely quiet. IT is VERY VERY addictive. If you miss a day, its hell.. I would be very tired, moody, and eat a lot. Its almost impossible to stop taking. Your brain learns to rely on it to function. Overall, for me, Adderall is effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD, however, you need to be aware of the side before you start taking it. Also as a child who was raised on the drug (my parents thought they were helping) I would never in a million years put my own children on Adderall. \"

He has ADHD and Ausperger's. WITH IT he can focus in school, his behavior is more age-appropriate, he is more successful in completing tasks, and in general is much more in control of his own actions.  WITHOUT IT the change is remarkable - he is hyper, impulsive, and spirals out of control. He knows how he wants to be, but gets frustrated as he is unable to help himself. I would reccommend this medication to anyone who's child  has ADHD, as I see no reason for the patient to struggle with the disorder and feelings of failure, shame, low self-esteem, etc. that go with it.  It's an appropriate treatment for ligitimate medical condition!  We monitor his dose very carefully, and don't give it after 10:30AM, so he has no trouble sleeping at night. Others have mentioned addiction issues. That won't happen unless one abuses their meds and starts down that slope.  I suggest that if it weren't Adderall they abused, it would be another substance, so please DON'T BLAME THE MEDICINE - blame the addictive behavior.(and I mean no disrespect, I truly empathize with those people and what they endured)

I have liked it a lot, but have suffered with skin side effects for years that are only now being attributed to this drug on the internet (i checked in late '06 for something else but found little info then, on skin rashes or what I was looking for. then.  I checked with my therapist just tonight, to see if he was hearing from other patients about picking at nails and skin on fingers, or about rashes on my arms, skin separation and bleeding under my skin. He has been hearing more lately about the picking of nails and skin on fingers.  If my skin issues end up being a bad side effect to adderall XR I'm going to be so angry at the medical profession for negligence because all of them have seen my skin.  I've even been sent by one, to an oncologist for cancer screening!  No doubt stimulant meds work for me and I'm grateful to have had access to them these past 12 years but doctors can no longer afford the time to learn/know what they should, in order to catch my ""severe allergic reactions""!

My sleep patterns prior to this medication were severe coma like conditions, it was un-telling when the next time I could ever wake up on my own. After a sleep study followed by a nap study to rule out narcolepsy, my pulmonologist deemed it not narcolepsy and started me on Provigil to see if conditions improved. Soon my need exceeded the maximum dose and he switched me to Adderall XR. I now take 60mg a day before bed. Yes, before bed. Taking the pills the morning didn't really work when I couldn't wake up to take them. I sleep wonderfully and after a couple years of taking this have finally established a routine sleeping schedule. I go to sleep every night at around 10-11pm and wake up at 6am every morning WITHOUT an alarm clock.

Since taking this pill, I've benefited nicely by some of it's other side effects mostly relating to learning capacity. I've never been one for reading, mostly because I'd fall asleep, but now, I'll read through an interesting text book like it was a novel.

A side effect I wish I had was decreased appetite and weight loss. Since this pill, I have gained 40-50lbs. Probably because I spend most of my spare time advancing in non-physical activities. If only a mental workout burned more calories.

Some really bad side effects include withdrawals. DO NOT stop taking this pill before speaking to MD. Imagine how bad you were before and double it; if you didn't have depression before, you will. Because this Med is a Class 2 in the US, it is highly controlled, very hard to refill and not run out. Talk to your MD about a backup MD when that one is out. There are no refills, you must have original signature (no faxing), maximum is 30 days per RX, and they can only release the RX one week prior to running out. Keep in mind any insurance authorizations as well."

I think that the adderall does all the work for me, I lost total confidence on myself if I dont have adderall to read or study or go to school. I feel dumb if I read, study, or go to school without adderall, this has affected me alot. My psychologist told me I'll would grow out of it & that I put the effort in my school work not the adderall.

I was just recently diagnosed with severe ADHD, moderate depression, and mild anxiety. I have known that something wasn't right with me since I was very little but I have parents who were in denial and too afraid of stigmas and what other ppl think about them to have had any help until now. With Adderall so far I have noticed that altho it definitely helps my concentration/focus/motivation it causes me to hyperfocus (act OCD) about certain things, my anxiety is worse, and I get mean and brutally/cruelly honest with those around me at times. I've also noticed that I talk to myself more often (which I've always done to a certain extent; like when I'm frustrated, doing math, or figuring something out)but now is more noticeable. I also have very bad dry mouth, an unquenchable thirst, and chapped lips. I can't go anywhere without a bottle of water and chapstick now. Otherwise, the sleep problems and loss of appetite went away after the first 3 days. Right now I'm in the 'deciding' phase trying to figure out if the benefits outweigh the side effects. I know that I have to continue some sort of medication along with my cognitive behavioural therapy because I can't function at normal expectations at this point otherwise but I'm uncomfortable with some of the possible side effects and the idea of becoming dependant. I have a history of street drug use(I self-medicated as a teen/young adult) and altho I have been clean for years I am always very careful and afraid of becoming that person again. Up until recently, I had only heard positive things about Adderall but now I'm not so sure. I guess I will finish off this month, talk to my psych more about it, and then go from there...

My doctor said this is OK. I also noticed that I have to take a xanax to ""come down"" from adderall, as it gives me a lot of energy. It does help me focus better and it gives me more motivation.

My doctor prescribed it because of my depression. Two years ago I had 7 major surgeries and spent a whole year in the hospital. Since then I haven't been myself. For the past several months I have not wanted to leave the house. All I want to do is stay in bed or lay on the couch and watch tv all day. I don't go to work unless I absolutely have to. I'm a Realtor so I work when I want to, which isn't much. My doctor and I are hoping this medicine will help me get my drive and motivation back. I seem to have lost a part of me. I also take Cymbalta 60mg, and Subutex 8mg. I just switched from Lexapro to the Cymbalta so I'm still waiting to see how the Cymbalta will work. I've only been on it a month. As far as the Adderall, I took it this morning and haven't really noticed anything different yet. Does it take a while to kick in or build up in your system? Maybe I don't have a high enough dose? I guess I'll just keep taking it and see what happens. I'll write again when I have more things to say about it.

I have trouble sleeping but I have always has severe insomnia.  I've lost a lot of weight then again I had high blood pressure and needed to.

It really has been a godsend. My brain is not scrambled and I can actually organize and accomplish tasks at the correct due date! Something I could never do before, no matter how hard i tried. Yes i've lost around 20 pounds since starting Adderall my Senior year of high school (i've been on it around 2 years now) but I'm still at a healthy weight and I'm so much happier with who I am now. I know adderall is desired by many college students and therefor gives it a bad reputation, but Adderall really is a great drug for those of us that ACTUALLY have the disorder!

My neurologist prescribed Adderall 30mg xr about 3 years ago and has been my lifesaver ever since. I continue to work a stressful full time job and am thankful for this that it gets me through my day. I have no problems sleeping whatsoever and am a power napper once I get home from work. It does not have the affect of not being able to sleep, but then again, other reviews I've read seem like it is highly prescribed for ADD disorders.  It has truly helped me with my disease and cannot imagine ever going off of it. As long as this drug is not abused, it does wonders!

My ADHD is mostly impulsivity, but hyperactivity was also sometime problematic. Concentration was never really a problem for me. In school I often got in trouble for shouting out answers without being called on. Also before I started Adderall I almost always reacted before I thought, and said and did a lot things that I regretted later. Now I usually think out actions before I act, so I get in a less fights now. The only drawbacks to the medication are because it is extended release you HAVE to remember to take it early in the day or else you will be up like all night. Also  probably the only real side effect that bothers me is the apetite reduction. But I have found the best way to get around that is eat a good breakfast before you take it, and have some healthy snacks around the house for when the medicine wears off night so you can have something to eat. Overall I am very satisfied with Adderall xr and a pleasant surprise was if I woke up too late and didn't take it  I didn't experience any major negative consequences, but I did have to try a little bit harder to make sure I was thinking before I spoke.

In my short college stint one of my professors pulled me aside told me he had pulled my file and wondered why I did so badly in his course because my test scores were so high. I have been successful but it was a long hard struggle. My wife of 32 years is a retired special education teacher. About four years ago she told me that she didn't know why it never dawned on her but she felt I was ADD. I am not hyper but have always had trouble staying focused. In school I use to fight the urge to look out the window and I couldn't concentrate. I went to my doctor and was tested he felt this medication would help me. Boy was he right! I makes me wonder where I might be if this could have been diagnosed when I was a child and there would have been treatment for it. At that time I was considered lazy and treatment was staying in at recess and having to write ""lines"".

I have been taking meds for ADHD for 28 yrs now.  I like Adderall XR because it lasted longer than the Ritalin, therefore I didn't have the up down up down feeling.  Adderall is a smoother transition too.  Of course it is not a cure all.  I still watch what I eat, work on time management, and do the occasional talk therapy.  I have also been the subject of multiple studies on ADHD since I was ""raised on Ritalin"" here it what I learned.  I am more prone to Alcoholism, I am more prone to ""falling in love"", I am more prone to acting out my anger.  Actions and feelings are easy impulses but my ADHD is not an excuse.  My mind understands, what has been so hard is to delay the impulse whether I am on medication or on a medication vacation.  I take 30mg of Adderall XR in the morning, 30 mg of ritalin in the afternoon, 80 mg of Straterra, and 300mg of Wellbutrin.  All this Medication in one day so I take med vacations in order to lower my tolerance.  Funny thing is I am only diagnosed with ADHD.  Believe me Doctors have tried to find some other condition bc ADHD usually is combined with ""something else"" but I am a classic ADHD case.  Getting meds for ADHD is easy now adays what is hard is taking responsibility for your treatment after your diagnosis.  I quit drinking, have taken the anger and time management classes, and married a man I respected.  I also don't use my ADHD as an excuse in my professional life, my employeers don't need to know my personal life.  Finally Yoga has had a great affect on my ability to focus, HUGE.  I hope the people who are ADHD make it clear to their Doctors that the H means hyperactive NOT manic.  I have experienced too many non ADHD doctors who are ready to label and prescribe the newest ""condition"".  I don't have much respect for the medical communities understanding of ADHD.  All I know is that the medication is only one part of the equation, its the easy part.  Good luck i hope i helped."

126$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$6/29/2011 11:28:10 AM$Reviewer: trailrider, 45-54 Male  (Patient) $4$4$5$I've probably lived my entire 49 yrs with undiagnosed ADD, but over years of building defense mechanisms to compensate, it evolves into issues that don't fit the traditionally accepted symptoms. I was never hyperactive, don't currently have difficulty reading or focusing on specific tasks. I do however, tend to hyperfocus, don't like interruption and don't transition very easily. I also don't like a lot of activity and noise as that affects my ability to focus. At times, my mind is being barraged with a bunch of external and internal stimuli. It becomes too much and I will get irritable and react negatively to my family. It's not the way I feel inside, but it's all right on the surface trying to defend my focus. It has evolved into a degree of anxiety and depression about the inability to soften the impact of stimuli. I was starting to get more and more down, more withdrawn, and dark. I tried some of the anxiety/depression medication like Zoloft (a year and a half), but I felt more anxiety from them. I am not sure the Zoloft ever worked for me at all. I finally decided one day to try my daughter's Adderal (she also has ADD). The difference was significant. 80% of the negative stimuli dissipated and was replaced with positive feelings... confidence, patience, peace. Everything became more manageable and I felt a lot more normal. So after a couple months on Adderal XR25, it is working pretty well... not perfect, but a lot better. I also tried Focalin and was initially prescribed Vyvanse. The Vyvanse laid too heavy on me and I felt out-of-body. The Focalin was better, but the Adderal XR25 seemed the best fit. For adults, symptoms and issues around ADHD don't fit the traditional. The psych said adult ADHD is in the process of being redefined by the medical community.

No withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. I have been back on it now for about 4 months. It gives me great energy but not the way it used to. I am also taking Prozac to treat depression, and I think that the Prozac might buffer the Adderall a bit. I am a bit concerned about potential abuse but knowing that I can stop w/o terrible withdrawal makes me feel better about that. I used to take Adderall with Cymbalta, and Cymbalta seemed to support the effect of Adderall. I stopped taking Cymbalta (with horrible, horrible withdrawal) because it platoed as well. In general, I agree that Adderall is a great medication but it has to be taken responsibly.

I hated it. This drug has changed my life. I never thought I had anything wrong with me medically despite my crippling inattention and mild bipolar depression. Then a friend gave me an adderall, and I wanted to get a scrip for it because it was such an improvement over my regular life. But my doctor wanted me to get tested for ADD... I really didn't think I'd turn up positive, but I did, as well as the previously mentioned bipolar. So instead of giving me adderall IR right off the bat, he wanted me to try XR. It's been perfect. I never feel drugged at all, it feels totally natural, and it defeats my regular daily depressive feelings and gives me energy. I can now follow my dreams and passions with an un-stifled hope and confidence.

I am so focused and awake, it has saved my full time job and has allowed me to work a second job and be successful at both. I can concentrate so much better! The only problem is that I've learned I can't take the second adderall after noon or I won't sleep at night. I also learned that I can't take 2 every day like the doctor prescribed. I have to either take 1 a day and skip the weekend, or 2 every other day or I will get agitated easily and the withdrawls from coming off of it for a couple of days is horrendous! It makes me feel like I have the flu or something. It is very addictive because of the effectiveness-concentration and being wide awake. Overall, I would recommend this drug to anyone with ADD, but would also recommend being closly monitored by your doctor, as this drug can be very addictive.

I had adult ADHD so my mind would try to focus on multiple things at once and it would overload. For the first few months the medication was great.

The last year and half has gone from good times to a living hell. I upped my dose from 20 mg to 20 mg and 15 mg in the afternoon. That is when the living hell began.

It made me feel like the world around me didn't matter. The only two things I cared about were my grades and my girlfriend. Everything else was non existent in my mind. I started losing friends left and right, I became a lot less sociable, and my parents knew something was up. When my only other friends I had told me what they noticed, the medication made me not believe them and I then became very paranoid.

I thought everyone around me was an enemy looking to make my life miserable someway or another. My anxiety levels skyrocketed and I always had my head on a swivel. It was a terrible way to live life. I even started thinking my girlfriend was up to no good when she wasn't around me so I started becoming clingy to her.

Thank God I stopped taking this medication. I found self worth in myself again and I my ex friends became friends with me again. Everyone in my life noticed a great difference and that's when I realized I needed to stop taking this medication.

My advice, ""DON'T TAKE THIS MEDICATION UNLESS YOUR ADD/ADHD IS RUINING YOUR LIFE."" And if you have to use this medication, make sure you use it only on the days you need to concentrate. Your life can spin out of control if you take this medication for an extended amount of time in my experience."

I started with depression and anxiety meds when i was 16, but nothing ever helped. By that time my ADD symptoms became much more apparent and began to hold me back in school and life in general. Zoning out, easily distractible, terrible working memory, poor verbal expression, thinking quickly, things that a lot of people take for granted. I began taking Vyvanse about 2 years ago at the 30mg and then 60mg daily doses, and while it helped a bit it wasn't great and mostly just gave me overall energy, but not necessarily mental efficiency. It also gave me heart palpations and tachycardia. Then i switched to 20mg Adderall XR twice daily about 12-18 months ago, and it seems about the same as the Vyvanse. I later added 80mg Straterra as well, with no perceivable difference to me (maybe more irritable?). Good energy booster, and it seems to help motivate me, like beginning difficult or monotonous tasks (aka homework) isn't climbing mount everest anymore, but the palpations and tachycardia are still there. It does seem to have slightly helped my working memory (sometimes), concentration (sometimes), and motivation (consistently, but not totally). Again, it's not a miracle, but as bad as ADD makes me feel most of the time, i'll take what i can get.

I was on Adderall XR for about 3 years. It did help me focus but the side effects were awful. I really found out after I went off of the drug, which wasn't hard at all for me. I was off medication completely for 3 years and went back on Ritalin this time. I now only take 15mg of Ritalin as opposed to 25mg of Adderall and I can focus enough to do my work and still go to sleep at night. For those of you who have ADD I (not hybrid or hyperactive) and are experiencing side effects I definitely recommend trying other forms of stimulants. It might take some time to find the right match (like finding the right girlfriend or wife) but it is so worth the effort.

Before it was prescribed to me, I spent 75% of my week in bed depressed and unmotivated.  Now I am able to accomplish whatever I wish to do with focus and energy.  And since I suffer from treatment-resistant depression, Adderall XR serves the additional purpose of relieving my depression (with the only downside being that the depression returns once the med wears off).  It also has a 3rd benefit by reducing appetite, so I have been able to lose some much-needed weight.

DO NOT TAKE THE GENERIC! The salts are different in the medication and cause it to release differently.

So the Adderall was for the purpose of giving me energy and keeping me focused. I know that sounds bad, to fix symptoms with more meds, but my doctor and I gave it a shot. Adderall gets a bad rap, understandably. I used to be addicted to uppers, which made me nervous about taking amphetamines. Believe it or not, it doesn't trigger any of the ""high"" feelings. I take 30 mg as prescribed, no more than that. It doesn't make me speedy or irritable. It doesn't kill my appetite. What it does do, is help me get out of bed in the morning and want to do things I procrastinate on. It helps my short term memory and I stay on task. I take it in the morning and excersise later at night, so my heart rate isn't up too high before working out. I really haven't had problems with this medication and I can go without taking it, I don't feel a dependency on it. This is my own experience taking this, and I know everybody has different reactions to medication. It's helped to rid the effects of my antidepressants which make me tired, apathetic and sleepy. I don't advocate taking medication for any purpose besides helping to let a person participate in their life to the fullest, and this has helped me do just that. "

He is now taking 10mg of Adderall XR every morning.  His focus and concentration both at home and at school has improved dramatically.  Only side effects are occasional nightmares...but only if he's overtired.  He'll wake up a few hours after going to bed and with about 30 minutes of random crying.  This has subsided the longer he's on the meds.  It was happening at least once a week, to now only once every 6 weeks or so.  His appetite is still good, although he looks very thin.  
Since watching my son's improvements on Adderall XR, I am now currently going through an ADHD evaluation to take care of it for myself.  I've had it my whole life, runs in my family...but was never treated.  Due to that, I could never keep a job or even finish school (no matter how many times I tried to go back).

He is doing fine in school - and could do a commercial for why this drug helps kids in a school environment (the teachers all agree).  The negative is, trouble falling asleep, then trouble getting up in the morning.  For a teenager, he doesn't get enough sleep.  On weekends, he'll sleep till 11 easily.  He's missed school because he can't get out of bed.  Its almost like his body crashes every 10-15 days.  I don't know how to fix that.  He likes how he feels when he's not on the medicine (he has more energy).  He knows how much it helps him concentrate.  It definitely makes him moody and intollerant at times.  But without it - that's just exaggerated too.  Adderal XR is a necessary evil i'm afraid.  Tried many others before sticking with Adderal XR.

Then she said she could see that i had an authritic back and that my bone density that she saw in the x-ray, was sufficiently losing density. SO, i told this to my pysch., who prescribes me my adderall, this about my back pain and she said it will go away. Then when I go to the hospital when my back really hurts, they think I'm just trying to med seek for pain killers. I'm 26 and look a little younger for my age and I think that has something to do with it. I don't know, I just want the pain to stop."

It has helped me lose 80lbs in 18 months which I am fine with! It makes me very irritable and short tempered, and if I do not take it for 2 days I feel worthless. If I miss one day, it's not terrible because I still feel it from the day before. I have never gotten the greatest sleep on it, but have learned to deal with it. I've found it to be extremely addictive and I would NOT recommend it. I have a complete love-hate relationship with this medicine. Without it though, I'm not sure I would've graduated high school on time, and am now currently about to graduate college in may. I have an 18 month old son and I did NOT take it during pregnancy, and I did start taking it immediately after he was born, due to lack of milk anyway. I was not able to breastfeed. It has helped tremendously with the ability to keep up on the demands of a toddler, school full time, and recovering from major back surgery. Downsides for me based on personal experience are: dry mouth, excessive sweating, dizziness, sleepless nights on occasion, COST if not covered by insurance, heart palpitations, extremely tight back muscles in the evening, teeth gritting, and anger/frusteration. It has helped me in so many ways, but also has many side effects, and due to the fact that it is so addicting, I wouldn't recommend it to people under 21.

I believe it is a wonderful drug, It has helped me and my son. Thank you

I've been taking it for 3 years now & it has changed my life. I am not addicted to it, I don't take it when its unnecessary (i.e. no work/school/studying). The only thing that bothers me is that people who don't take it & dont understand just assume its bad for me, which makes me feel like im taking speed (which I guess it kind of is), not to mention the movie ""requiem for a dream"" (dont watch that lol sometimes I feel like the old lady). Anyways, does anyone think they should be worried that its a legal version of speed? Or do most think it is truly for medical purposes & unlike illegal drugs, there is a positive reason for it?"

It has changed my life, although I understand that everyone is different and reacts to everything very differently. You have to take that into consideration when reading these reviews. 

I always felt like there was something not right with me until my Phyc. suggested the Adderall. First I was put on a  Regular Dose of 10mg in the morning and a 10mg in the afternoon (which I hated cus I'm terrible at taking my pills), so we switched to 20mgXR. Things has changed drasticly. I can focus, Im not chronicly late anymore, which then disposes of my road rage. My work is off the charts (Im a hairstylist), because I can really focus and listen to my clients. Before I always had a million things running through my head and couldnt get my shit together. I obvioulsy have more energy, and I do have to say that my anxiety and depression have lessened. I think eveyone gets anxious, its just a part of life, it doesnt mean you have something wrong with you.

So side effects, signifigant weight loss, 12lbs since November, Im not complaining. I do have loss of appitite during the day and def am hungry when I get home. I notice my mouth is always dry. But I have no problem getting to bed. And I really don't have dependency issues, some times on Sundays I don't even take it.

So that's that, It works for me, may not work for you. But you have to try things to know how you'll react!"

The effect is steady throughout the day rather that having the ups and downs of regular Adderall.  I have no side effects with XR whereas with the regular version I felt like I was on speed.  It really helps that I only have to take one XR in the morning.  Like many an ADDer I have problems remembering things.  More often than not, I would forget to take my afternoon dose of regular Adderall, or if I did remember I would find that I had forgotten to bring the meds me.  My prescription drug provider used to charge $10 per month for both versions of Adderall.  Now they charge $10 for the regular and $260 for XR.  My doctor is filing an appeal, but if it does not work it may be worth it to me to bite the bullet and pay through the nose so that I can stay on the XR."

Before that, I took Dexedrine.  With the exception of ages 18-21, I took some form of stimulant since age 13.  

Adderall is highly addictive.  I feel it has ruined my life.  I loved the euphoric feeling and weight loss side effects, but it was so addictive I broke down and took it during my last trimester of pregnancy and now I fret it has caused a disproportionately small head size in my11-week-old daughter.  (weight and length are off the charts but head is only 50th percentile, and was only 25th percentile at birth)

It was also so addictive I quit breastfeeding at 5 weeks to go back on the meds.

Now it's causing dry mouth to the point of receding gums and ruining my teeth, and I'm still considering going back on it.  (when I realized the affect it was having on my dental health -- I quit taking it, and that was 2 days ago.  The fatigue from the withdrawal is crushing.)

I wish my parents had never started me on these meds.  

Please, parents, do not start your kids on these meds.  Their ADD can be an asset -- there are different perceptions of this 'disorder'.  They are better at multitasking and can hyperfocus when they are truly passionate about something...

The drugs are a gateway to a nightmare.

I probably do have ADHD but I am convinced that my use of Add over 2 years contributed to my life spinning out of control. I became impulsive, sometimes agressive, etc; started drinking excessively to ""come down"", mind was moving too fast to deal with life issues. Be wary of statement on this website that benefits should outweigh side effects! For me, it was great for a while but wow, did it help me mask life and land in a ditch (literally as during one episode I totalled my vehicle). Remember that the generic name is ""amphetamine"" and this is, for me, just a nicely packaged pharmaceutical called ""speed"". I'm now dealing with life on life's terms; not perfect, but drug free and I pray I never go back!  Again, rigorous honesty!"

We just had our last and final episode of the med...she totaly ""wigged out""....worse than the previous hysteria...all about cleaning her room.  It took my husband and me 45 min to calm her down.  She was mentally and physically exhausted.  We were terrified by what we witnessed.  She's only been off the med since Sat., but so far she's feeling better.  I'm scard to try something else, afraid of what those side effects might be.  We also read about Adderall being taken off the Canadian market because of severe side effects, including death.  Unfortunately, this didn't warrant its removal from the US market and I only learned about this AFTER the troubles my daughter went through."

I have been taking Adderall XR for over 3 years.  I am now considering changing to a different ADHD med.  Here's why:

When I filled my prescription for DAW (dispense as written) name brand Adderall XR, the pharmacist showed me that all the pills in the name brand bottle were all imprinted with M. Amphet. Salts - just like the generic. She even opened a new bottle, to show me that Walgreens wasn't trying to screw me over.

I called Shire and they said that the FDA approved Shire imprinting the name brand capsules with either ADERALL XR or M. Amphet. Salts and that as long as my prescription came from a name brand bottle that said ""Shire"" that I was taking the same name brand drug I've been taking all along.

I HIGHLY doubt what I've been taking for the past few days is regular name brand Aderall XR. I have been experiencing headaches, as well as, tight/clenched upper back muscles, tingling/numbness in my face and pressure behind my eyes. I also feel like I'm on something - I never felt like I was on something when I took name brand Adderall XR before!

I called Shire again and again they told me that as long as my prescription came from a bottle that said ""Shire"" that I was taking the same name brand drug.  Shire is lying."

I have severe ADHD that runs in my family. My brother has ADD and my sister has hyperactivity without the inattentiveness that she finds highly adaptive. My nephew (brother's son) took Adderall with great results for many years. Although I have had a lifelong history of ADHD (and was in special ed) I had always been misdiagnosed. I won't even go into the crazy things I was labelled with. Despite such a grim prognosis I was able to complete grad school with a 4.0 average at USC and obtain a professional license in health care. When I tried to obtain meds for ADHD this was used against me and I was told that I could not be this successful with severe ADHD and was even labelled bi-polar by the chief of neurology due to my hyperactivity which has become worse when I turned 50. Finally a colleague prescribed Strattera which not only made my sick it also gave me nightmares. Next was Concerta which worked great but gave me such severe dry mouth that it destroyed my mucous membranes. Recently I switched to Adderal. By this time I was saying my prayers. It works great! I had mild dry mouth that was self-limiting and am on top of my game. The best thing is the improve social skills due to < impulsivity and the improved concentration. I am a new woman! Thank you shire. I take 20 mg QAM and 10 mg in the afternoon. It also decreases my PTSD symptoms. From reading the posts my experience appears unusual and I hope it encourages adults.

Adderall XR is the best hands down.  Strattera didn't work at all and the concerta was ok but didn't last 12 hours like it's supposed to, plus my liver enzymes tested high on it.  Vyvanse gave the worse sides.  My eyes were always bloodshot and I was always paranoid.  I feel at ease and can focus and concentrate for long periods of time at school and work.  For people that legitmitally have ADD/ADHD like me, this drug works wonders, provided that you take it properly and DO NOT crush the beads and snort it or inject it.  It is meant to be taken orally and create and acheive a steady baseline level so there aren't as many highs and lows throughout the day.  One side effect I have found out to be negative is that it takes me 2 hours to fall asleep at night.  Aside from that, I now live a normal life and excel in both school and work.

I am taking several medications that make me very tired and lethargic, have gained weight easily and often feel as though I never slept at night.

In fact, I usually only take it in the morning, particularly when I've had little/no sleep or it was not restful sleep. It really helps me get going and get things accomplished... which in turn makes me feel productive. The only side effect I notice is a headache in the late afternoon. I am careful to refrain from taking it too close to bedtime, or I won't be able to sleep. I didn't know and did not experience the appetite suppressant effect.

Adderall has worked very well for me. Some of the benefits for me are increased focus, ability to effectively process information and form and express coherent thoughts more effectively. When I am on my medicine, I find it easier to complete tasks, whereas without the medication, completing even the easiest of tasks (like unpacking groceries) is difficult because I get sidetracked. When I am not on my medicine I tend to exhibit a lot of impulsive behaviors, but on my medicine, I am better able to think before I act, so to speak. Another benefit is that I am not bored as frequently. One obvious negative side effect is loss of appetite. I lost a lot of weight in the first year or so of being on Adderall. I could easily go for a day without eating. I just didn't look healthy. Some of my family members and teachers thought I had become anorexic and were getting worried. After I graduated college, I went off Adderall for about a year and hated it. I gained back the weight I had lost plus more because of nervous/bored eating, and I struggled in school (in my masters program), at work, and some of my relationships with others suffered. I have been back on Adderall XR for about 3 months now and am much happier with life in general. I just feel more balanced and in control of myself, which is nice. I have noticed decreased appetite, but to a MUCH lesser extent than in high school and college. Some of the negative side effects I have always experienced while on the drug are decreased sex drive (although that has improved), dry mouth, and what I call ""hyper-focus"" - the inability to switch from one task to another. The effectiveness of AdderallXR obviously varies from person to person, as do the positive and negative side effects. THough I have had some negative side effects, my overall experience with AdderallXR has been VERY positive."
258$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/10/2010 8:40:22 PM$Reviewer: butters, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Don't use it for concentation.  Take a nap or a walk.  There are actually real medical reasons to use it.  If your not eating then make a note to remind your self to eat, if you have dry mouth drink more fluids.  If you can't sleep try a snack before bed or a warm bath or maybe you're dose is too high.  You shouldn't go OCD from it. I've been misdiagnosed for over 3 years and this is year 4 and I've started a new dr and the generic form of Adderall XR and since I've never taken anything else I can't compare it with the label or any other type stimulant.  I've started on 10mg and will be on 20mg next week.  I can sleep, eat and have been slowly teaching myself to slow down and pay attention to what I'm doing and to listen better.  It also has been on the market for years and the side effects are small compared to some you may not even know exist until later. :)

Adderall XR does seem to inhibit my ability to fall asleep, and I've found I need to take it no later than 7 am in order to be asleep by 11 pm. Adderall XR does not seem to control my random leg-bouncing or foot-shaking, but it does significantly improve my ability to concentrate on tasks and during conversations. I'm completely satisfied."

Have narcolepsy in addition to ADHD, and as an adult who has never been treated or diagnosed until recently, didn't know my issues were so severe. My psychiatrist recommended it and I take 10mg per day. Since beginning it, I have less distractability, more focus, more concentration, easier time remembering tasks, not losing things anymore or misplacing things.
The few things that have slipped away are the racing thoughts, the negative outlook on all things in life, and my inability to sleep through the night. I am glad they have. I can concentrate more. However, it has also taken muscle spasms away and now I can feel every bit of my fibromyalgia pain. So in conjunction with Adderall XR, I take Lagnasil (Lamotrygiene) and have a muscle relaxer (Xanax) which helps with the pain at night. Overall, my cognitive reasoning and function has VASTLY improved. If you suffer from ADHD, I hope you give this a try and see if it works as well for you."

I have no side effects. I sleep better than before, have a regular appetite, no dry mouth, no mood swings. I take only 10 or 15 mg per day. I'm sure I could take more for better concentration and to stay on task easier, but I take the minimal amount of medication I need to enable me to use the other coping skills I have developed. This drug should be used to help ADD symptoms, it's not a cure. We need to learn skills to deal with our ""handicap"". Taking medication can take away enough of the noise and chaos to allow us to learn coping skills. For some who have described negative symptoms, try cutting back a little at a time, it may be a little harder to concentrate but it may eliminate the negative effects and still give some positive relief for ADD.

I don't even want to leave the house. I am thinking about switching to a new drug, but I am nervous it will not initially help me like adderall once did. Very, very addictive drug. I would not recommend it to anyone who couldn't deal with the jitters, loss of appetite and difficulty getting to sleep. But it does eventually go away. I just don't recommend it for long-term use.

I do know that some people truly do need it though. If you do want to come off of it I would suggest your Dr. slowly taper you off of it. And ask for a rx of Provigil or Nuvigil to help you stay awake and alert during the day. These two drugs are intended for alertness and narcolepsy. They just aren't an amphetamine. Hope this helps if you do wish to stop adderall. Happy health. - B. Anonymous

I did not get it officially diagnosed until I was 50 years old.  I knew the stigma of Narcolepsy would interfere with job searching. 
My new Neurologist is a sleep studies specialist. He is aware on how ineffective the Amphetamines react within me. No side effects, slight increase in heart rate and slight rise on the BP. No burst of energy or any other effects.  I am now on a base prescription of adderall and adderall XR combination at 160mg per day. At times the ranges may go as far up to 240mg or down to only several.  The amount of the dosage is directly dependent of the dayâs requirements.  I also try to take 1-2 days of Adderall free days to lessen the problem of drug tolerance.  The adderall still at the high dose performs very poorly in managing my microsleeps. I can take a full dose, wait 45 minutes, then lie down and fall asleep. I am also on Xyrem treatments for the last 5 months.  Xyrem is not working very well.  I have been diagnosed as a right clinical context narcolepsy.  I unfortunately am one of the exceptions to the effectiveness of amphetamines and the like. Even from the beginning, the amphetamines have had little effect on my body. History:  I was never a drug user and I never liked to drink alcohol. I still don't drink or use recreational drugs.  Never had any of the 'so called side effects' that amphetamines can give someone at the higher dose. In the past I have had provigil and ritlan with no effective treatment. If the above appears to be disassociated, I had more than several microsleep episodes trying to get this written.

As far as my ADD is concerned, it works wonders. However, I get extremely fixated while doing things (such as browsing the web and cleaning) and will often do them for over 5 hours without stopping. It has caused me anxiety, a misdiagnosis of a heart mutation due to my high heart-rate (caused by the medication), teeth grinding, and frequent sleep problems. Also, the withdrawal symptoms are very severe and I often can not even stay awake during the day if I do not take it. Overall, the benefits do outweigh the side effects and I feel that I will be continuing to take this medication for a very long time.

I started with Ritalin and that didn't help all. I was switched to 20mg twice a day. That worked well but it hit quick and wore off quick. Especially, I have a 20 month old and sit at a desk working on a computer all day. So, for the last 2 months I am taking 30mg XR twice a day. It's working great. I was on unorganized, missing dead lines and just would daydream and go on the internet. Taking the Addreall really helped with that but I was still having a little anxiety, worries and a little tense. Not a lot but I still felt it. The Dr. gave me Cybalta 60mg once day or instead the Cybalta, try 1mg of xanax. The 2 combine has given me energy, focus and I am in a good mood with basically no worries went I get home and can enjoy my time with my son. Everybody has to try to find their own combo of prescriptions, since everybody's body's make up is different. It took me abbot 6 months before I found this combo and the right dosage.

I was calmer than I had been in years, I was able to hang with friends without wanting to leave after 30 minutes...However, no matter how effective it was, I begged my doctor to switch to a different medication because of the side effects.  

While taking this medication for five months, I lost my appetite to the point of being unable to even look at food without feeling sick resulting in extreme weight loss.  In addition, the medication affected my ability to fall asleep at night.  One of the most severe side effects I experienced was a sudden, extreme slowing of heart rate and drop blood pressure.  I experienced this side effect 7 times while on this medication and it would last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half, and each time it happened I know ""I don't want to die"" crossed my mind many times.  

After all of that, one can probably imagine how hard it was waking up every morning and willingly taking the medication that was not only supposed to help me, but was clearly hurting me too. In the end, I guess taking this medication just comes down to facing the side effects.  If you want something that works, this is it, but remember that the side effects for this medication are nothing to forget."

I didn't notice any improvement for attention and had side effects such as increased depression and feelings of hopelessness, lack of sexual desire,and tiredness. The depression issues are what helped me to see that Adderall wasn't working for me. I am already taking 200mgs of Zoloft and was doing well on that, so at first I thought maybe I needed to  increase the Zoloft. After another day of falling asleep after taking the Adderall and having had a full nights sleep, I decided it had to be the Adderall. Stopped taking it for 3 days and felt more energetic and depression lifted. Will keep communicating with the Dr. until I get it straight--or me straight!! :)

I found that I seemed to have a more difficult time staying focused on tasks, projects and other things I have get done at work on a daily basis. 

My doc decided to let me try the 10mg dosage, didn't do much for me probably because of my weight at the time (5'9"" 210lbs).. so he upped me to the 20mg dose. That dosage has been pretty effective for me for the past 3 1/2 months so far. I take it pretty regularly but skip it sometimes on the weekends. Overall I am pretty happy with what seems like a subtle but welcome increase in my ability to stay focused and the uplift in my energy level. I've started watching my calories and exercising more (and I have to imagine the Adderall helps) and so far have dropped 20lbs and am more consistent with the exercise than I have been in many years.

I began taking the 30mg pills but suggested being lowered to the 20mg pills because I had many of the symptoms listed. I lost a lot of weight, as well as my appitite, and became very irritable. I also developed annoying little habits like tapping my foot and clicking my tounge uncontrolably. But overall, this drug has done wonders for me. My first year of 8th grade I failed miserably. I was written up over thirty times that year as well. I could not concentrate no matter how hard I tried, and I got in trouble so much because I was so hyper and bored. I was prescribed Adderall XR the next year and I did a complete turn around. I made honor roll and maintained an A average throughout the whole year. My behavior also change. I had a better attitude and did'nt get in any trouble at all. I have just graduated high school, and thanks to Adderall, I continued to make great grades and control my behavior throughout my high school years as well. I was even accepted into a great university and given a scholarship. Adderall changed my life. I am convinced that I would not be where I am now without it. It does have some negative effects, but the advantages were much more visible(in my case at least).

I've had trouble with listening, paying attention to detail, getting things done, anxiety, stress, eating disorders etc etc the list goes on. I come from a family who cares for me tremendously so it has nothing to do with them..So, before I started taking this it was hard for me to even get out of bed in the morning & carryout my day. I was diagnosed with bulimia/nervosa & depression so I take a combination of Prozac & Adderall and it has changed my life 100% and for the better. I wake up with energy, take on the day, I dont binge eat nor vommit because with the adderall suppressing my apetite I do not get the urge to eat when im bored. However, it is easy to maintain a healthy diet and eating regularly. For the first time I am making A's in my classes, which NEVER happened in highschool & I enjoy life so much more. The thing I really had to get used to was harnessing my energy. I would start a ""project"" and not want to finish it until I was done but i would really need to do homework or something of greater importance. I had to train myself to prioritize and make schedules, something that comes so easily to others. But, once I re-trained my brain how to function to be successful it really helped me get through life. Like I said, I'm finally making good grades AND getting to class (and everywhere else) on time. I'm not sure if I reccommend adderall to kids under the age of 15 unless theyre morally responsible but I definitely recommend it to young-adults & so on."

It helps concentration all day.  In my experience, it should not be taken after 11:00 am because it may cause insomnia.  This medicine also decreases appetite, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on the patient.  I am not overweight, so the appetite supression became a slight problem for a while, but the positive effects outweighed the negative effects by far.  Once I had been taking it for a while, I was able to eat normally again, but people who are under-weight should be monitored in order to make sure they are eating enough.  Another thing about this medication is that it is very addictive.  It has been effective for me for the past 4 years, but I am unable to function normally without it.  People who are prescribed Adderall XR should be aware that they may become dependent, and if they are to discontinue taking it, they should definitely taper their dosage down fairly slowly.  Overall, Adderall XR has been an incredible improvement for my concentration.  I believe, however, that it should not be administered to young children because of it's strong effects.  If it is needed for a child, they should take the lowest effective dose.

In the begining we tried a different medcation that was not lasting long enough for him. So we tried Adderal and over night we saw a big differance in him. He was about to concentrate through the whole day. I noticed that he would get emotional in the afternoon.  The way we fixed this was to make sure he had a snack in the afternoon to re-boost the medication.  The medication is time released right? so the reason for mood swings in the afternoon is because lack of protein in the body.  Try this and you should see a differance.

I had bad mood swings. I was dizzy all of the time. I was so tired, but I could not sleep. Eating made me feel like I was going to throw up. I was keeping my room clean and doing everything I was supposed to do because of the medication. I was more focused and serious about things, but I lost friends. I was no longer myself anymore. It took everything people loved about me away. I recomend to think before you use this drug and to be careful if you have important things coming up. The side effects totally changed who I was and what I could do. The friends I told about this were the ones that helped me when they started to notice things and that helped. When I finally stopped it took awhile for me to fully lose the side effects. Keep up with your side effects and make sure you think is it better for me to stop or keep going. In my case the bad totally wiped out the good.

I was started on 20mg of Adderall xr, then went to 25 mg xr, and now I take 25mg xr in the morning around 6am, and then an Adderall IR, 10mg, around noon to one p.m. I think Adderall works great, the problem I had was that even though it is an XR formulation it seemed to wear off around noonish everyday. I was never able to get ""all day coverage"". In February my doctor added the 10mg IR ""booster"" and it has worked great ever since. He told me that every one's body metabolism is different and some get longer coverage than others. This is what worked for me. I was worried about sleep issues being on this dose, the amazing thing is I actually feel like I sleep better since being on this medication. When I lay down to go to sleep I don't have a million and one things floating through my head like I use to. It's like the background ""white noise"" is gone. My thoughts are so much clearer now and I can actually get things accomplished instead of 20 things half accomplished. It's too bad people abuse this drug, it's makes it more difficult for people who use it for legitimate medical purposes to get it. All of my other medications I can get a 90 day supply in the mail. With Adderall I have to go to my doctors office every month and pick up my prescription in person. Other than that absolutely no complaints. Good luck to all."

Just a totally different child. I thought Omg, why did I waite so long to take him in to be treated!! Then, gradually it got horrible! He started having what I called ""These Fit's"" He would get so upset at the drop of a dime.On the way to the psychologist one day, we were leavin well he wanted a cheese sandwich and we were out of bread.The only bread was end pieces. Well he went CRAZY! Kicking, screaming, hollaring, ""I hate you! I wish you were dead! Nobody likes me anymore!"" It was as if the exordist had entered my little angles body. We got to psych. and it was only once I told him, that he was able to settle him down(after a 2 hour drive there)and he also got him a cheese sandwich. I later found out from his pediatrician that this was a really bad side effect of the meds.Except for the mood swings, outburst the medicine was great. But we had to switch to Concerta 18mg. cause the mood swings got worst and worst. Now, he is my little angle again. That just goes to show you, it is trial and error. Some meds work better for some people than other's. Hang in there, cause somewhere down the line, one will work the best!!!

As for the loss of apatite I just decided to get more carbs protein all the calories etc, more in just a 1-2 meal's a day instead of having 3-4 ( yes i love to eat and I am a cook) But for the most part the loss of apatite will dissapate once i get myself, used to the medicine.

Now as for how it helps me out has been great, I have alot more focus, I don't feel that my mind is running around at 1000mps in 800 different directions. I also get that euphoric feeling of happiness, and sometimes catch myself spacing out to the clouds sometimes, or just good enjoyable moments that i prolly couldn't stop myself to see.

Overall I enjoy this medication, sometimes yes i get mad that i only get 4-6 hours of sleep but I am learning to manage my sleeping times to were it cycles just right, and now that i have been on it for about 10 days i am starting to actually sleep 1-2 hours more a night as long as knowbody calls me or etc. (before i was a heavy sleeper now I can't even take naps :( i will miss you naps.) but now i dont have to string my alarm clock across the room to force me out of bed and to turn it off etc cause before i would just sleep through it"

After I started taking Adderall I started noticing a difference right away; I was a whole new person. I have been on 50mg a day for about 4-5 years now and I don't know what I would do without it. I can focus, finish everything I start, I have more energy. In the first year of taking Adderall I did loose a significant amount of weight, but for me...my appitite came back.

I made it through school but was always reprimanded for being a procrastinator or being too social. After passing my nursing boards and having a job that required responsibilty, so to speak, I talked to my docotr and she was amazed that I had made it this far in life with the severity of my symptoms.  I have been on Adderall 30mgBID (twice a day) and can not believe the difference.  I am a full time student and work full time nights also, I have total ability to complete everything as needed. I no longer procrastinate on anything and feel so much more organized.  I have had about 20 lbs weightloss so I am 5'2"" and 107 which doesn't look so healthy. another side affect that I experince is the ability to sleep forever when I don't take it.  I have no problems sleeping at night on the days I take it but its nothing for my husband to come and wake me up and it be 2pm :(! I have also found that having gum on hand at all times helps with the dry mouth.

I personally refer to it as Theta World.  Just east of Narcolepsy and due south of ADHD type 1.
Adderall XR has worked well to fill a void that was missing in my quest for balance.  It provides a ""kick"", of sorts, to the mind and body.  I find it spurs mental motivation, which in turn, the body responds to quite well.  I take 1 in the a.m and 1 in the mid afternoon.  This seems to get me through to the early evening. Note:  There is some irrability experienced, in my case, as the dosage fades.  Foretunately,I discovered Strattera long before adding Adderall XL, which actually works very well as a counter measure.(Read my review on Strattera).  Although, I should add that Adderall XL does not have the crash that I experienced on some of the more popular ""stimulated"" drugs.  Nor do I feel a ""pull"" of dependency.
That being said, I did inadvertently take a short ""Holiday"" from the drug, and noted  a definite drop in mood towards depression accompanied by an increased lethargic feeling. A withdrawl effect. Not dire, but to be noted, nonetheless.

He became depressed and his grades dropped. The symptoms improved when I took him off the medicine for a few days and returned when started taking them again.  He had become depressed again because he could not focus in class. He is now taking Adderall 10mg instead of the Adderall XR. I don't care for the medication, but he was becoming depressed again because he was struggling to pass his basic courses. I'm hoping that a lesser dosage will not create as many problems.

Increased my ability to focus on important details, caused a 25lbs weight loss in 6 weeks..I looked anorexic because I'm tall and slender as it is.  If I drink coffee during the day I'm like a crackhead - very antisocial, nervous, won't answer the door phone etc, lose track of time, and crazy OCD.  So I cut down on the coffee and that's working.  I also take ""drug holidays""  just to make sure I don't ""need it"".  When I want energy and need to focus I take it..otherwise, I leave it. I also experience mood swings and my muscles tighten up, so I get buns of steele without the exercise.  I have the best career in the world and taking adderall makes me even better at it.  Be smart, take it properly and pay attention to the side effects and you'll be alright.  I worry about children taking it because they need to be social and be accepted by their peers, and it's tough if you lack personality.  So three years for me and I'm in control of it and happy.  Oh..and when I take the drug holiday, I don't get withdrawals..just more tired than usual for the first several days.  Take Vitamin B for that."

I barley made it through college due to my lack of attention and followthrough. I tried Strattera and I was a walking zombie. I hated it. Then my Dr. put me on Adderall xr and it has been fabulous. I only take 20mg a day and should talk to my Dr. about bumping up my  dose, however, I am very consiencious due to the fact that I am a recovering alcoholic for 14 years. Adderall xr has changed my life. I used to dread going to work and very busy days and now I know I can get through it. I respect Adderall and never take more than the Dr. prescribes (trust me I have been tempted to). I do have problems sleeping at times so often if I have an early morning I don't take my second dose later in the afternoon the day before. This drug has saved me so much anxiety before I was on it and how I was going to get through the day. I do get irritable and cranky at times but the payoff of focus and energy out weigh the unfocused, lethargic piece of crap I was before this. Bad News. I have not lost any weight. Good news I have not gained any either. Good luck. Stay moderate

I have to say I've had a pleasent experience with this. I am in Nursing school, so the Adderall gives me that extra push I need. I feel like I constantly need to be studying, I listen & take better notes in class, and my grades have got better. I am also able to study for longer periods of time because I have more energy & can stay up later. However, I have had some pretty drastic side effects. I occasionally have dry mouth, but my anxiety & stress seems to be 10000 times worse, I seem to make situations alot worse than they actually are. I am ALOT more irratible & don't have much patience. It has made me very blunt, so I hope noone makes me mad. & my finger has got to where it twitches but other than that.... & on the days I don't take it, i'm so tired, I can hardly keep my eyes open but i'm in a happier mood, just too tired to do anything. So for the most part, my exp. with Adderall has been good. ALOTTT better than Methyphenidate (wayyyy ti many SE!) which I was taking prior to the Adderall XR.

I was diagnosed with ADD a year ago and ever since then being a student-athlete and keeping up with school as well as performance on the field because of Adderall has made a world of difference. It creates absolute attention on one subject at a time and a great sense of focus. Taking more than recomended though can cause shortness of breath and heart issues.

Originally diagnosed an treated for dep./anx. in my thirties, but it was my ADD that caused these issues.  Started taking 20mgs. of Adderrall.  I'm enjoying life now as never before because because it helps me focus, organize, and want to interact more with people.  My only worry is that I hear Canada has banned it because of risk of stroke, heart problems, and hardening of the arteries.  I'm going to ask mo doc about it.  Another worry, my five year old (I have four kids under seven) seems to be just like his old man.  I would be devastated to have to put him on this during his physical development.

I have Insomnia which is a sleeping disorder, it doesn't help that much when you take it later in the day. Some people take the Adderall XR in the morning and then take the instant release form of the medication in the afternoon/evening. I highly do NOT recommend that kind of treatment. Especially to people who don't already have a sleeping disorder such as Insomnia/RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) I also have Paranoia,Major depression,Anxiety,Panic attacks and phobias. I take 30 MG Adderall XR one time in the morning get that good feeling then the feelings just kinda melt away, and leave me somewhere in the middle of the day. Also again I highly don't recommend taking Any form or MG of Adderall in the evening hours if you don't already have a sleeping disorder cause it ""will"" cause you to stay up later than normal and develop a habit that unfortunately 9-10 times can not be self medicated in anyway to fix. You cause yourself to get Insomnia trust me you don't want to have Insomnia. It will make you more tired during the day worsen Depression if you don't already have it you will when you have Insomnia you will be more agile, and frustrated,Angry at the world blah blah blah. Something I'm going to try and do Is take the 30 MG Adderall XR closer to noon. Therefor I should be covered for the whole day and then be ready for bed at a normal hour. The Adderall helps me with my mood,Depression,Anxiety,Panic Attacks. Not my Phobias in case your wondering what my Phobias are. Here you go get ready to laugh cause they may seem innocent and true for a lot of people, and may seem like I don't have phobias their normal. Believe me I think their funny too so don't think if you laugh at some of these your going to hurt my feelings. All these ""phobias"" triggers me to bust out in anger and have ""panic attacks"" some sometimes and some most of the time. The way Old people drive,food in a sink,peoplewalkingbehindme loll"

I have had every negative side effect, as well has had a lot less trouble with school. Some of the negative things the medicine cause for me are Nausea, Headaches, Dizziness, Dry Mouth, nearly Fainting when standing, General fatigue/weakness, Muscle Tension, Muscle Spasms (Sometimes EXTREMELY painful, most pain I've experienced ever), Lack of sleep, restlessness, jiteriness, Some OCD-like symptoms (Obsessing over little annoyances), and that's not all. Even though this drug has brought me so many bad things, it has also been the only thing that allowed me to be successful in school, and not be so hyper-social. I honestly wouldn't recomend this drug for some one who hasn't tried other ADHD medicines without success, as they would probably be less troublesome, but for me, this is what worked. This drug is also NOT for some one who doesn't want negative side effects, as they seem abundant. The only problem really, is the consistency of negative side effects. For some they don't appear at all. I have found that this drug makes it so that when I stay up late, I don't get tired easily, and the next day it barely feels like I stayed up late. This can be a blessing and the opposite. For instance, I stayed up late once, and forgot to take my pills the next morning, and what resulted felt like being drunk, half dead, and like I hadn't slept for at least a couple days. All I could do is sleep, and I ended up so weak that I got sick. So, the moral of the story really is, Try Adderall, and if you get negative side effects, make sure there isn't an alternative medicine for you.

The only side effect that I had while on this was the loss of appitite, but this was only when I skiped breakfast in the morning, or my dosage was raised. For new people on this, I suggest that you make sure you eat a good breakfast, because that was what got me though the day when it came to eating meals. I did lose weight while on this, but it did not become a problem because I watched it. Make your self aware that you are in control, if only you take the time to really take care of your self.

I started taking this b/c i realized i had ahdh.  I was 24yrs old when i was diagnosed.  After i started Adderall, my mom saw a big difference in me.  i would actually listen when someone was speaking and not automatically thinking of a response.  my mom stated when she thought back on my childhood it made since that i had adhd.  i was never had the classic symptoms (acting out, bad in school, ...).  They never thought to test me.  i wish i would have been diagnosed as a child, i feel i was cheated out of of life.  maybe i would have completed college and not switched majors multi times.  instead, i am now working to support a child and i have 6 years or so of school i have completed but no degree.  if any parent is unsure, let their child try it.  trying it wont hurt anything, you can always take them off.  i wish i would have known or had the opportunity to decide on medicating, i may have made the wrong choice but at least i would have had a choice.  Adderall has helped me w/a lot of things.  i have better friendships b/c i am a clamer person.  at work i can actually sit still and get tasks done.  i have always got work/homework done but now i do it without thinking how much i dislike whatever i am doing, i can focus and get it done before i even think about how i feel about it.  i love adderall and never go without it!

I am 41 years old. I am currently working on my Degree in College. I had taken other ADHD medications which was like taking nothing. After speaking to my Doctor about other medications for ADHD, we decided to give this one a try. It is easy to use, It works for me, and I am completely satisfied. Some will say this is an evil drug and don't start it at all. Of those who say it is evil, I say talk to your Doctor and try something else until the right one is found for you. I no longer have a foogy brain, I can sit in class and not fidget..I understand and now retain what is said..and while yes I still get tired because I also have MS & Fibromyalgia just to name a couple of things, it works for me and I no longer need to sleep for 16 hours a day. So I say to everyone, young and old always discuss the way your ADHD, & ADD medicines are working and if you find something is not working well, then try another medication to find the one that works. Never give up. No one is alone.

Without the help of Adderall XR, it would be much more difficult for me to concentrate in school and at my full time job.
This medicine has helped me yet I can see how it can be habit forming.  For this reason I choose to only take the medication when and if I need it.
It doesn't necessarily bring about moodiness for me, though it does help me from getting distracted easily.  The way I would describe it in Layman's terms is; It gets me in the zone.
Be careful with this medication."

I'm 6'2"" tall and weigh 200lbs.  I can easily sum up Adderall xr by saying WOW!!  I used to be very very anti anything ADD/ADHD, I use to think it was a way for the pharmaceutical companies to ""push more drugs"" on us.  What changed my thinking was when my son was having a lot of trouble with school work and was diagnosed with ADHD.  I saw the exact same symptoms in him that I had when I was young.  I have always had trouble in school.  It wasn't that I wasn't interested I just couldn't stay focused long enough to get into the material.  I went and spoke with my family doctor, told him the situation, the symptoms I was having, my past school performance, current job performance, etc... and he decided to prescribe me Adderall xr 25mg.  Another thing he told me to do was to cut out ALL caffeine, which I did.  The first three days I popped Ibuprofen all the time because of caffeine withdrawal headaches but after that the transformation has been wonderful.  I have had anxiety problems with mild depression for as long as I can remember, actually anxiety runs on my side of the family.  Starting the first day with Adderall I could tell a big difference.  I had that euphoria that everyone writes about but my thinking, concentration, my ability to prioritize, and get things done has been AMAZING.  Now that I have been on the med for a little over 3 months the euphoria feeling is gone, that was gone in the first few days of use, but my ability to stay focused, concentrate, prioritize, and basically ""get er done"" has been excellent, actually after a month of being on the med it seemed like it improved somewhat again, I actually find myself speaking slower and more methodically.  I couldn't be happier.  I actually think that A LOT of my anxiety and mild depression have been related to my NOT being diagnosed with ADD sooner in my life.  Since starting this med I actually feel like a different person. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

I finally took a proactive approach to my life and decided to get tested (observed). Come to find out i have ADHD. Most of my friends said they knew i already had it but it was not that apparent to me. The diagnosing doctor told me my life would improve drastically to the medication and what it has to offer. Well, within months of starting the medication my employer created a new position for me as i was finally able to focus. My finances are getting back on track (paying stuff off instead of frivolous spending). Relationship i am working on but i am finally more focused on taking my career even further. I wish i would have taken this approach earlier in my life. I am now 33 and finally living my life the way i want. I used to sleep terrible, now i actually have no issues falling asleep (most of the time anyway). My dreams arent random and dont wake me up anymore and i dont feel that everyday should not end cause i didnt get everything done. If you feel the same and are wondering why you are like you are go to a behavioral therapist. You life WILL improve just as my therapist told me it would. Now to find Mrs. Right ;)

Let me start off by saying, yes, my grades improved dramatically--moreso than they have in years.  However, I noticed that my anxiety has gotten worse. I will get paranoid about stupid things that aren't worth getting paranoid about.  Does anyone know why this is? Plus, when I first started taking it, I could tell that my heart rate was moving much faster. That was annoying.  AND it really freaks me out that the one of the warnings on the label says, ""May cause sudden death.""  WHHAAATTT???!!!  I guess it all depends on how many mg's you're taking, right?  I don't know how some people are taking over 100 mgs of this stuff!!! Maybe they just have really bad symptoms of ADHD. I don't think I could ever let myself take more than 10-15 mgs of this stuff. The label does warn consumers of heart problems and things like that, so I'll just stay at my current dosage.  It has helped me dramatically in school, though! YAY!!!"

My ADHD diagnosis at the age of 35 was liberating. I saw the 'top' doctor in NYC who charged $750 and saw me for 15 minutes to make the diagnosis - promptly prescribing Adderall RX. Each subsequent $250 session lasted less than 5 minutes to monitor my progress on the Adderall RX. Initially things were great. I was able to focus on tasks, I did not get drowsy driving and my appetite was manageable. I actually lost 12 pounds! I saw that as a positive side-effect. At the time I started, I read that Adderall RX was the new Hollywood diet drug, so I felt tres chic! Anyway, it took me a while to realize that Adderall RX was making me less tolerant with more feelings of rage. At one point, I broke a full length mirror in my wife's office by impulsively putting my shoe through it during a heated argument. I MUST NOTE THAT I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE!!! I also felt what I could only describe as a pain in my liver after several months of taking the drug. If I stopped temporarily, the pain went away. As soon as I resumed, the pain came back. Another leading NYC expert consulted with a top expert at Mt. Sinai, who had never heard of this side effect. Whether it was recorded or not, I had it and don't since stopping the med. My course on Adderall RX lasted about 9 months. I also was in a n ADHD group therapy class. In the end, I deceided that this is who I am, that drugs are not a miracle cure and that the pain in my liver and feeling enraged was not something that was worth the extra focus and appetite suppression. I do keep a stash for long driving trips, because it absolutely keeps me alert and I don't feel like I have to pull off the road to nap. Hope this helps. WOuld love to know if others felt this pain in their right side or, as I describe, my liver."

Through the years, I have had a need to up the dosage, finally transitioning into Adderall. I find the XR to be the most effective for my condition, due to its ability to slowly release the drug vs. having to take multiple pills. I am satisfied with the results of this drug. Although from time to time I do seem to have a slight jitter, usually if I have not eaten before taking the prescription. Aside from that, I would recommend this type of drug to those with a similar condition to mine.

I am now 41. I started on 20mg and noticed an immediate differance in my focus and energy. But soon the effectivness wore off and I went up to 40mg... then 60... then 80... then 100... then 120mg. I began to experience psychotic-like symptoms and my doctor pulled me back to 40mg. I dont feel like its doing anything for me anymore and I often find myself staring... just zoned out. You will always need more of this drug over time for it to actually work. It is highly addictive. I cant get out of the bed without it. It used to be my ""wonder drug"" in the beginning. I felt better and worked harder and smarter than I'd ever dreamed possible. Now I suffer with severe anxiety and cant focus on anything for very long. It causes irritability and keeps me from eating regular meals. But I am addicted to the energy it gives me and just today I told my psychiatrist not to take me off of it even though I have such bad anxiety. He isn't the same doctor that once prescribed 120mg. He really thinks I should come off of it. Deep down, I believe I should too. Sometimes, even on just 40mg I feel so wired. My eyes dilate, my hands are always cold and I shake. I have to take Lunesta 3mg to go to sleep at every night. I will say that Adderall XR was only a short-lived fix for me. I have never been hyperactive... just attention deficit. If you are taking it, maybe you will have better results than I have."

The only side affects I've noticed are it seems like it takes me longer to fall asleep at night.  I think the drug has helped me immensely, I have been taking 20mg of Lexapro for about 4 years now and it has helped with my anxiety but my head always felt clouded, I always felt like ""my get up and go got up and went"".  I was always just sluggish and wanting to nap all the time.  My attention span was always very short and I became bored with things very fast, I was constantly punishing myself for daydreaming and trying to make myself focus.  The second day of being on Adderall XR was when I noticed the biggest differance, and it has been the same since starting.  My thinking is SO MUCH clearer.  The constant ""background noise"" of continuous thoughts is gone.  I was afraid when I started the drug I would feel like I was on a caffeine overdose, but it's not like that at all.  Your thoughts just clear, I even speak slower, I'm more focused on what is going on, I don't even think about taking a nap anymore, don't have a need to.  Things that I used to constantly procrastinate on just get finished.  Not only are you doing the things you didn't do before you have an enjoyment in doing them.  I have always felt that I was an anxious child growing up and I think that A LOT of my anxiety problems as an adult were definitely related to my ADHD.  So far I can't say anything bad about Adderall XR.  I take one 25mg capsule in the morning, eat breakfast and go about my day.  The only other medications I take are a multivitamin and a fish oil supplement at lunch and Lexapro 20mg before bed.  I would highly recommend Adderall XR especially if you have anxiety and depression.  Good luck to all. "

Yet, I am at ease, calmer since i've found the right dose (no more that 15 mg. a day). Before I took to high of a dose and developed severe anxiety. I stopped for a while, it eased off and I found the right dose. So far it is not addicting and helps just enough to increase motivation, clear my head and not bounce around flitting from one thing to the next - when i take it, I dont get bored nearly as fast. Thats really good in school.

Prior to taking this medication, I have always had difficulty concentrating and staying on task.  I have also changed jobs/careers frequently and was asked to resign from my last job in February. 

I have always had problems with insecurity and impulsiveness, and since my job loss, I have been depressed and anxious.  Adderall, with the combination of low doses of anxiety and depression medication, have made a huge difference.  I am able to focus like never before, stay on task, and have a much higher level of confidence.  "

That about sums it up. Too much of a good thing. It was typical. It made me feel great. It made me feel as though life was worth living. I wrote, I focused, I read, then before I knew it, the crash would hit. And I would pop another one. At one point, I was up for FIVE DAYS with NO FOOD. Things start to go down hill on day 2. You can't focus as well, your nerves are shot. You are weak. But man, when that exhaustion hits, it's so scary. I did this off and on for months until one day my doctor said, ""No more."" This was because I finally told him, ""Im out and I feel like I'm dying!"" I was taken off large doses 60-80mg a day for 4 months COLD TURKEY. I was out early. And this time I told him. I could not take it. I hard trouble just moving from the bed to to bathroom.I was SEVERELY depressed to the point of suicidal thoughts. I slept 23 hours a day for five days. My tolerance was though the roof. I could take 80 mg in the morning just to feel ""normal."" Finally a doctor took mercy on me and cut my dose down to 20 mg a day with the explicit understanding my mother would be doling them out to me. I weaned off them gradually. Finally down to 5 mg a day. The withdrawals from this drug when it abused is nothing short of the definition of hell. Exhaustion is complete and total. You are NON FUNCTIONAL.  It's hard to give it a rating because my addictive mind abused the hell out of it. If you have any history of substance abuse STAY CLEAR! WORST DRUG I EVER ABUSED AND I DID JUST ABOTU ALL OF THEM!"

I was off meds for quite a while, but in my senior year of college, decided to try adderall.  Heard good things, and have noticed that it wakes me up almost like drinking a cup of coffee.  Definitely pay attention better, but I may up my dosage, as I am only on 25, where I was on 40 when i took ritalin.  The biggest thing i noticed though, was my lack of appetite.  I don't even think about food until at least midnight, depending on when i take the pill.  As of now I have only been on it for a couple weeks, and have lost 6lbs.  For me, that is an added bonus, but could pose problems later on and possibly malnutrition if I keep forgetting to eat.  Overall though, very satisfied.

I take it first thing in the morning and it works all day until late afternoon. The problem I had with other meds was having to REMEMBER to take the second dose in the afternoon because being ADD I have a tendency of not paying attention to the time too closely and would remember too late in the afternoon to ake any more if i wanted to get to sleep that night at a regular time. Taking Adderall XR takes that problem away making my life flow a little easier.

Have suffered from depression caused by severe sleep apnea and recently found after taking ephedrine that my depression vanished while on it- so much so forgot to take my anti-depressants for 3 months. However, since I have been on this drug I have experienced a lot of side effects ranging from no appetite, LACK of concentration and sense of time, sleeplessness (not what I need with apnea) weight loss and emotional episodes (such as sad commercials will make me cry), teeth grinding, and abdominal pain. Doctor is aware of the side effects and am going to try for a few more weeks before making any final decision as many med side effects fade for me over time. For what it has been prescribed for, as an anti-depressant/ stimulant, works great! But the side effects may just be too much.

Then, when I would ""crash"" it was Katie bar the door! I dared anyone to give me a reason to go postal. I suffered thru until this past February when they came out with Vyvanse.

The trick is getting the dosage correct.  Too low of a dose kept me up for 24 hours, too high of a dose had me sleepy before noon.  With the correct dosage I sleep better than I have in years and can actually accomplish the things I need to get done.  As an adult I think it is great, but I can see how it could be difficult for a child to handle this medication.  I am not saying that I would not give it to a child, but I would be careful.  I am a 165lb, 38 yr old male and a 20mg xr dose is perfect for me. The medication works differently on everyone, but I could not imagine 60-90 mg daily. I am sure there are some that need it, but I would never give a child that kind of dose. Best of luck to you

I first started w/ ritilan and then to dexadrine and then to adderall and then to adderall xr when it came out. The majority of the yrs I was on adderall/adderall xr though. It helped me focus and get things done like it was supposed to but it made me not feel like myself. I was really quiet and reserved and just not myself when I would take it, so much that people would ask me if there was something wrong. I didn't realize that it made me feel that way so much until I graduated high school and stopped taking it all the time unless I needed it. I guess b/c I was constantly on it for so long that it didn't effect me as much, or it wasn;t as obvious til I stopped taking it.  I've taken it on and off when I needed it for 5yrs now until about 2 weeks ago I started on Focalin which seems to be working better.  In addition to lacking personality, adderall made me feel very depressed when I would come off of it.

One of the side effects is the inability to focus and concentrate. My doctor gave me Addreall XR to help me with work since I was falling behind and losing jobs. Now Im doing better than I have in a long time. I can focus on things other than the negative stuff in my life, Im productive and confident I can get stuff done. All of this helped my overall mood since I had something positive in myself. However when my insurance ran out I stopped taking Adderall (its really expensive) and things went back to the way they were no matter how hard I tried to remain focused.


The only side effect I experienced was dry mouth...really dry.

Then I had to have spine surgery and everything went down hill. If there is a place called rock bottom, I can get you there without a map. I was very athletic, and an all-state goalie for our local ice hockey team and had scholarships poaring in the mail for college. I got so depressed I would not want to wish that, the way I felt, on my worst enemy. About the only good thing was I picked up the guitar a friend bought me and it pretty much saved my life. That was almost 10yrs ago. I have been on Adderall for about 6 months now. I was always energetic but when my wife and I had our daughter I noticed a big change in my sleeping habbits, emotions, and ability to stay alert. When I was given Adderall, the first day, I just couldn't believe the difference. I'm sharper probubly more so then when I wasn't on it. I'm so energetic, positive, and just all together alot better off. The only side effect I have is sometimes I wish I had been put on it a long time ago. I'm due for another spine surgery, this time will be the third. I have Scoliosis, a sever case too. I have 3 curves in my spine. So, with the help of god, this time when they go in and take the rods that were put in on the second surgery and somehow snapped in half out. On top of all of this though I can still remain positive and focussed. I have to be, for my family. But if not for Adderall I don't even want to know where I'd be. "

Any side effects i have had haven't bothered me and I never formed any habit or addictions to it. by tis I mean i very rarely take it during the summer or during weekends. I only take it when i need it. I cant recall ever feeling strande diffrent because of the medication either. Honestly i only realise how much i need it when i forget it. again i cant imagine id forget if i were addicted. I was never extremely hyper so i couldnt say how well it calms. I am also a sucsuessful artist and allways have been, i never have felt like it hinders my creativity or make me a zombie as it were. I have ADD, without the H but the squished the two together more recently i guess.  Seritonan is a chemical in your brain that is used among other things to block stimuli you don't need. this is why you don't feel your clothes after putting them on. I have a deficiency of it so it not inattention as much as, we try to pay attention to everything at once. witch is why during conversations my eyes dart around the room looking at everything, like the shiny stuff. I have been very happy with the medication, to the point where i may postpone increases in dosage in fear that they may decide i have too strong a tolerance and change it on me. I have been taking it long enough to have built confidence in the brand. I'm not sure if i will need it in college, only time will tell. the goal of course it to eventually no longer need the medication. I would recommend aderall but also have no experience with other medications.

He was started on adderall xr 5mg  for 1 mo. then increased to 10mg.  It's been a total of 3mo. I think this is a perfect dose for him. We saw a difference the first day. He no longer ""daydreams""or have trouble understanding what people say to him (we had his hearing tested, EEG's etc..).  Homework went from 3-4 hrs. to 1-2hrs. and it's done correctly! Most of the time he's done it all before he gets home. His grades went from C's and D's to A's and B's in one marking period. The side effects I've noticed are dry mouth and sometimes he's irritable with his 6 year old sister and he used to be extremely tolerant (it actually seems more normal now). He's lost 4lbs but he can afford it because he was 77lbs. I was worried about the slow growth side effect, but he grew 1 in. since he started. I'm just not sure if I want him to take it during summer months or maybe I won't give it to him on the weekends.  This is something I'll discuss with his doctor.

I was on adderall for 3 years and switched to XR after. I didnt notice the side effects until i was a senior in high school. I have struggled with sleeping, relationships (due to the emotional effects i am overly sensitive and believe i have developed depression from it), loss of weight(especially earlier on, not so much now. kinda wish it was the other way around after being in college 3 years), cotton mouth, sexual side effects, and most of all dependency. when i tried going off the drug for a year the withdrawals were hard to deal with. i slept most of the day for about a month and gained  weight from increased appetite. after the withdrawals had finally ended, i felt happier and easier to be around. my relationships were great and my depression was gone. all side effects had disappeared. i felt more like myself off the drug. but my grades in school suffered. i got back on the dosage and all the old side effects came back. my grades improved, but i am back to the empty sole less feeling of a study drone. my current relationship is suffering and i dont sleep much. i will be on the drug until i graduate. as soon as i do, i will be saying goodbye forever to it. i love my parents and know they were trying to do the best thing for me. If i have kids one day, and they are diagnosed with ADD, i wont be putting them through the same hell i have suffered for the past decade. ADD has been around much longer than it has had a drug for it and most people seemed to have still lived a good life with out it(my dad for example). I would not recommend putting your kids on this drug early on in their lives. wait until they can fully understand the side effects of the drug and let them make the choice because this is a life changing decision that is extremely hard to revert back from. if your child is happy, isnt that the most important. im still scared what the long term effects of the drug will do to me down the road.

It increases reaction time by 150%, along with attention and confidence. However, be advised against it if you are not sure of your symptoms. You will also experience sleeplessness, manic episodes, irritability, and decreased appetite if this drug is not for you. It is essentially a legal form of crystal meth, afterall.

By second grade (a year and half later) he was increased to 15mg but it didn't work out well for him. I believe he became immune to it and I had to change medications. Overall it was a great medication, no side effects with him at all and he was able to take it easily (either taking it apart and sprinkling on applesauce or oatmeal or swallowing whole pill).

I am a pharmacy technician, so i have resources at work to take a look at, but I still browse webmd.

My mom was afraid to put me on anything. She has since passed away from cancer and I decided to take charge and go to a doctor.

My doctor has been very, very friendly with me. He is a general practitioner and he always asks me how I am doing on it. When I began going to him, the dr asked me what I would recommend for the medicine for me to be on.

The first choice was Daytrana. I noticed nothing from that medicine.

Next was Ritalin SR 20. It worked..but gave me headaches.

Next try was adderall 10mg BID (Twice daily). It seemed to work, but my schedule didn't really allow me to keep taking it. I also didn't like bringing a C-2 drug to work.

So he asked me about adderall XR. I told him that it was worth a try, and since 10mg twice daily wasn't working, let's up it even more.

What a great decision!! Adderall XR 30mg once daily is working! I am now accepted more by my peers.

Hearing this, my Dr. decided to begin with one 30mg dose of AdderallXR first thing in the morning and 30mg at noon.  As I attempted to perform the boring tasks of my ""new"" job--anxiety increased so high it seemed I would snap in two--thus, I resigned.  

At this, my Dr. switched me to one 30mg XR and one generic non-extended release of 10mg at noon.  The anxiety lessened and I found I could focus on things like never before (the bad side is, sometimes I focus on things I DON'T NEED to do and hours pass as I search the web as I was doing just now).  

While on the 60mg XR, even though I experienced a heightened level of anxiety, I did an experiment and for the first time in my LIFE, I was actually able to make an outline, a REAL outline for a speech!  As a public speaker, this is pretty important.  

One strange side effect--before Adderall, I had stopped biting my nails and now I can't keep from chewing and ripping at them.  I have to glue on plastic nails to stop.  Also, I can't seem to fall asleep before about 1:30 AM, even if I take it at 7AM. But OFF of this drug, I used to feel lethargic almost all day and perk up at night, and on this dose, I have no more lethargy and I never nap at all during the day--I actually feel like a normal, thinking human being.  I wonder, what could be wrong with that, even if it IS addictive?  I'm not sure.  

Honestly, It's as if it connected those pieces of my 52 year-old brain that were never connected before...Adderall is not perfect--sometimes I have menopausal episodes of angst that are exacerbated by taking this stimulant, but even my husband noticed a marked change.  I am more ""real"" on this mind-assisting additive than not. 

Angst and nail-biting aside,  it's as if it has helped me find who I really am--helped my frontal lobe behave normally.  I don't want to go backward in processing information. It's so much better now... "

While it has helped her focus on schoolwork, she has a huge problem getting to sleep before 11pm now.  She can be very moody and I'm now considering taking her to see a child psychologist.    She has lost a lot of weight since she's been taking it and her doctor wants to make sure she doesn't lose too much. She's only 10 years old.  This drug has certainly helped her with school and she's doing great, but I sometimes wish she wasn't so nasty to the rest of her family.

It has helped me concentrate on everything I do. My thoughts are WAY more organized, and I don't have frequent bouts of confusion as I used to. I clearly understand anything being taught in class as opposed to before, and my grades have improved dramatically. College is not near as stressful as it used to be.

Cut out coffee so as to not interact with Adderall and SEVERE caffeine withdrawals that I initially attributed to the adderall. I was getting extremely fatigued in the afternoon. Crashing completely. One cup of coffee or about 100mg of caffeine fixed the problem. If you've been self-medicating you ADD with caffeine, be careful of withdrawals if you go of it while on adderall. withdrawals symptoms may or may not be headaches, might be fatigue, fuzziheadedness, inability to concentrate, sleepiness. As little as one 8oz cup of coffee or 25mg of caffeine can alleviate withdrawals. Adderall works great and lasts about 12 hours. I've been on it for 8 days.

We started out with Concerta which worked for a month, but we never saw a great improvement with his symptoms. He has been on Adderall for over a year and fianally last month we reached peak satisfaction. This drug is great, but ADHD is a disease that you constantly have to monitor and keep in close contact with your health care provider. His dosage over a year has increased from 10-25 milligrams. So, if you are like me and expect that a miracle will occur and symtoms resolve after a short period of time, do not give up, things will gradually improve and then one day you look at your child and realize that he no longer has significant symptoms of ADHD. My son no longer gets in trouble at school and has been on the A honor roll for quite some time. Adderall has been a wonderful choice for my child.

I don't have ADHD but i do have problems focusing, however, my friends and i agree that this medication GIVES you ADD (or at least it feels like it) even if it does help you to concentrate.

Certain difficulties I was having led my psychiatrist to suggest I may have ADD (not hyperactive).  The adderall works (no doubt about that), but other elements of my day-to-day activities limited its effectiveness - I worked rotating shifts, variable lengths of time - that prevented me from developing a routine.  This was dealt with by adding adderall (immediately acting) to the XR (30 mgs each).  This seemed to work, until I changed jobs and ended up with a worse working enviroment.  Now unable to focus at all off work, overstress at work requires increased medication for depression et al. 
Adderall might be an excellent drug, but only if used in an environment where behavioral aspects of ADD can be addressed, as well."

Once in a while I would have trouble sleeping but some people say they sleep better on this because their thoughts dont race before bed. As for mood swings I didnt experience any. Some people might have said I wasn't as cheery but it was because I was so focused on getting something done I didnt have time to be distracted. I consider this a good thing.

This drug ,though very helpful for my ADHD has caused me to have serious side effects from the past 3 years of use. I have now some little tics every now and then. There are little manic episodes associated with the drug. I even have depressive anxiety disorder because of this drug. Though this drug is great to solve a short term problem it should not be allowed to be used for longer terms. I am almost afraid to take it sometimes because I don't know what will happen. Also the mood swings because of the addictiveness of this drug are terrible. As I come off of it I become angry at almost everything. There is a reason it was banned in Canada.

I noticed a difference in my cognitive abilities almost immediately after using Adderall XR.  The 30 mg capsule made my heart race, so my dosage was reduced to 25 mg. The ideal dose for me would probably be somewhere in between 25 mg and 30 mg. My symptoms gradually worsened over a period of 30+ years and resulted in multiple job losses, divorces and financial difficulties.  I was not accurately diagnosed until age 45, although I had virtually all of the classic ADD symptoms dating back to childhood.  About 5 or 6 years ago I actually wondered if I had some type of learning disability because I could not process a complete thought, could not retain spoken information or instructions, was unable to concentrate on any task, etc. Although I discussed this concern with my psychiatrist at the time, there was no mention of the possibility of ADD.  I was given additional medication to treat my existing anxiety & depression, which did nothing to improve my ADD symptoms. However, on my first visit with a new psychiatrist several years later, I was given the diagnosis of ADD.  Of course, it would have been great to have been accurately diagnosed and treated years ago, but I am grateful to have found help at all.  I could have spent the rest of my life suffering if not for someone new taking a fresh look at my case.

I thought I grew out of it and wanted off the medication.  I am now in my mid 20's, just started a new job, which requires alot of concentration.  I was messing up all the time, and then decided to talk to my doctor about it.  She then prescribed me this medication, which after adjusting the dose, my boss and I have noticed a huge improvement.  The only things I don't like about it are, I love food and to eat.  I am underweight to begin with, and since being on addrell, I have lost about 10 more pounds.  I think I have gotten used to it, because I eat way better than the first few weeks of being on the meds. And the second thing is that I have had incressed mood swings in the mornings and evenings.  My husband and I fight like crazy now.  It doesn't matter how nice he is being, I take every thing the wrong way.  And since we both work the same hours, he never really sees me on them.

I was called a ""high aptitude/low achiever"". ""If he would just buckle down and do the work...his mind wanders...he refuses to get his work done. He's unprepared...he always has an excuse... He's disorganized."" I heard these comments from everyone. I frustrated my teachers, my parents and myself. I couldn't pay attention. School was a nightmare that seemed to last forever. I couldn't wait for each class to end. Yet I would do well on tests. I'd get terrible grades for class participation and homework assignments, but then I would get an A or a B on midterms and finals and end up with a B or a C in the course. In college I discovered amphetamines, which are much stronger than Adderall but had the same effect on my ability to concentrate. I'd be failing a course all semester, skipping classes, losing my homework, etc., but then I'd get some ""speed"" and learn the entire course from the book in a couple of days and ace the final. I was accused of cheating once because professor didn't believe I could have learned so much in such a short period. I was self-medicating, but I didn't know it. There was no such thing as ADD or ADHD in the 60's and 70'. I thought there was something wrong with me and I was wrong to take amphetamines. I couldn't take them all the time; the side effects were extreme. After college, I had to accept mediocrity in almost everything, but I got by. At 50, a shrink finally recognized my ADHD and prescribed Adderall. One of the best days of my life. No more antidepressants, no more confusion and no more procrastination and mediocre achievement. The fog had lifted. My life is so much better in every way. I've learned to accept that where I am today is the culmination of everything I've ever done. I can't regret that because I am happier now than I've ever been. Medical science has saved me. My newfound ability to think and act rationally has made it so I can help others through this sometimes confusing life.

I failed at everything. I would have emotional outbursts from being so overwhelmed. I saw so many doctors and counselors I felt like I was broken and no one was able to ""fix"" me. As I grew up I learned ways to manage my symptoms but it was exhausting. If i was succeeding at any point it always ended with failure or side tracked resulting in countless unfinished things that made me feel incompetent. ""Jack of all trades; master at none"". I knew I was capable of so much more but the distractions of hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling everything in my environment all at the same time made me dizzy and I couldn't sort it all out. It wasnt until a little over a year ago I began therapy, seeing a wonderful Psychiatrist who UNDERSTOOD ME! For the first time in my life i was reassured i wasnt alone. Apprehensively I began taking this medicine, it took over 6 months to start feeling in control of my mind, but now I have it figured out. Instead of hearing music, I am listening to the instruments. I can single out the drummer and follow his beats to the end. I am maintaining a high GPA in college, I am organized, efficient and I no longer feel like a crack in the sidewalk of life. I hate that people without a diagnosis, who aren't struggling are abusing this medicine that helps so many people function at high capacity who truly need it! The biggest draw back for me is seeing what I could've done years ago but didn't. I have noticed my heart rate goes up spontaneously which can be scary, but it does pass. I have to learn to give myself credit for my successes, I am not my medication or ADHD but they have both added to the positives of who I am. If you have been struggling, reach out!"

If I had been diagnosed earlier my life would have been better. I take Adderall 30 mg XL capsules and it changed my life. I feel normal! For my treatment this form and dosage works great. I take it about an hour before I'll be getting up and I'm able to function and stay focused at my job and at home. It doesn't make me jittery or hyper, doesn't take my appetite away ( I often wish it would!) I still occasionally need a nap during the day and have no problem falling asleep at night. I've always had low blood pressure, low body temperature, and low blood sugar but they tell me my thyroid levels are fine. I used to get a lot of migraines and had to have Imitrex Nasal with me all the time. Now I very seldom need it. For me personally Adderall has been a life saver! I take it as directed, don't abuse it, see my doctor regularly and can live a productive life. I've been on it for about ten years now, I'm female and 60 years old.
651$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$3/4/2018 9:30:37 PM$Reviewer: Ize, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"Made college a possibility for me. I was able to focus and perform well in my classes. Before that I had been failing but knew I could do more than my grades were showing. Over the years (17 or so I believe) I have remained on the same dose with no side effects. I have since been promoted at work and although I am struggling to learn time management on a whole new level I suspect that is normal and not due to ADHD. I continue to take my medication to maintain a level of ""normal"" cognative function like everyone else. Otherwise everything that crossed my mind would cross my lips and I couldn't keep my emotions in check. I would easily be overwhelmed by projects or anything that involved multiple steps and people depending on me. I would wilt under the pressure. Adderall allows me the ability to focus my thoughts and slow my mental process down. Filter the thousand bits of input I'm bombardrd with every moment. I can see the forrest through the leaves... This medication has been pivotal to my success and I was able to stop taking antidepressants after being on Adderall. I finally felt normal. Hopefully my review helps put a parent at ease when considering if they should put their child on Adderall or not. "

Without it I space out, have trouble prioritizing and getting around to doing what I need to do, and can't function as an adult. Before I started taking it I would pick fights (arguments) in order to get my adrenalin to go up so I could do things. Now I'm even-keeled all day long (and have learnt to space out dosage through the day in order to be even-keeled).  

I never take more than what I've been prescribed (60mg) and depending on the day I can function well on as little as 40mg.  This blue pill has changed my life. I've been on the same prescription for almost 20 years now. 

I once took too much and felt bad but it didn't feel like a ""high"".  If I wanted to get high Aderall would be the last thing I would take, because all it does is to make me normal. 

Note I have the Inactive diagnosis of ADHD meaning I was never hyperactive. I retreated into my inner world and spaced out instead. 

Hope this helps others like me.

Two months After the birth of my last child, I re-started my medicine and for some reason it didn't help as it did before. So I self-Medicaid, and take another pill.... Long story short, I became  dependent on the medication and could not go without it. I very quickly became addicted and started taking more and more. My mood changed, I was very   Aggressive and mean always yelling at my family my children would be scared of me I would lose my temper very quickly. Also This lead to no sleep, not eating, I became too thin, my hair started to fall out and became very thin and stringy. My husband didn't know what to think, and I became someone I didn't even know. I almost got my children taken away and a divorce.... Mortal of the story it changed my life upside down and I had to stop taking it!!! I have been working with my doctors and now I'm on vyvanse along with depression medicine and it works great!!

I had no trouble sleeping. In fact it truly improved my life. I no longer have insurance coverage and had to ween myself from the medication. The quoted cost for this med is at least $800 a month in Co. and just under $400 in Wy. I cannot afford the out of pocket cost. Now, I am sleeping 16 hours a day and sometimes still opt for a nap. As you can see, without this medication, I am sleeping my life away. I wish it was more affordable. I really miss it."

After a short while of being on Adderall he became very angry and defiant. We thought that since he was going through puberty & dealing with ADHD that he was just having a rough time dealing with the chemistry changing in his body. As time went on he became more aggressive threatening to stab his father with a butcher knife & constantly going up against his dad & peers at school. He distroyed things in his path & punched holes in the walls of our home, yelling & cursing when anyone rubbed him the wrong way. The slightest things would set him off into fits of rage. He took on multiple personalities one being very evil as if Satan's son. He was a Jeckyll & Hyde.  This went on for 4 years as the dosage was increased because of his high tolerance to Adderall. After being in support groups & reading up I discovered other we're experiencing these very same side affects. I demanded the doctor to take him off of it and since he's been off of it for 6 months now & almost instantly I got my sweet boy back. I read that Adderall was like taking crystal meth. This medicine needs to be removed from the market permanently in my opinion. He was in & out of the hospital 4 times in a 3 months time frame. Not once had the doctors ever try taking him off the Adderall. All they did was ginnea pig him pumping him full of antipsychotic meds. He ended up for the first time in his life getting in trouble with the police for assault on an officer, resisting arrest & interfering with police business. Adderall is a very dangerous medication. If you benefit from it without the bad side affects, then that is good. If not, I would not take this medication.

The psychiatrist who prescribed this med for me had given me a 6 to 8 question survey for ADHD. THAT was the extent of her diagnosis. Never asked how my BP was or what other meds I was taking. I believe she is a source of adderall for students who attend university about a half-mile from her practice. She presents put together but I think she's missing a screw when it comes to being a smart and engaged psychiatrist.

I am very concerned about the popular misuse of this drug by students. It enhances focus for studying but is very addictive. Many drug addicts promote it to their peers, and also tell them what to add to improve the 'rush'.
Please - don't let your children use this unless it is vital and justified, such as for narcolepsy or ADHD. And, if your child is addicted, defiant and refusing rehab, please learn to help him or her via e.g. an online course for parents with addict children such as Parent CRAFT (cadenceonline.com). I know I might sound like a crazy lady, but this drug is being widely abused by students and too many health care professionals prescribe it without caring about consequences. "

Without this medication I would never have graduated high school, college, and be working on my second degree. Sometimes medication is the only option for those who try everything possible first. This drug is nothing to play with, it takes precise clock work, discipline and knowledge. You have to ensure you are keeping your body healthy when taking it. Yes, it does have side effects but yes it does work great for those who need this type of chemical balance. If you want to prevent the ""rush"" as some report, EAT first. Then, make sure you drink more than the minimum amount of water a day. I literally drink about 10 waters a day. Stay away from caffeine and make sure to NEVER take this med. at night unless you don't plan on sleeping, which is another thing to make sure you are getting enough of. A balanced diet, sleep, and overall life routine is important. I also wouldn't recommend you take it if you are going to a social event, because like me I'm not the socialist butterfly on it when I would normally talk an ear off. With proper care and balance this is the answer for most. It is my answer and I'm more than thankful I have gotten as far as I have and I am thankful for its creation. I hope this helps some and also to the mothers, when your child is on this med. it's best to leave them alone. They just want to focus and most likely won't want to eat. It's just how it made me and when they are ""coming down"" they will need something to pick them up..it's a horrible crash on the XR(extended release caps 8hr). I usually drink a soda or a coffee. Sometimes I will even take a 1/2 of my instant release(4 hr tabs) if I have school work still to help ease the crashing. Lots of water to prevent headaches and time the pills. I don't get the full 8 hours that some would, I'm about 4 hours and I begin to fade. My doctor has me prescribed 1 8hr cap in am(7am) and then by 12pm one 4hrtab, 4pm one 4hrtab. single mom so long day"

I started taking it because I couldn't focus/was very disruptive in Kindergarten. I stopped taking it when I was around 13/14 and went back on when I was 15. When I'm on the pill it really does help me focus, but sometimes I'm so focused that I get lost in what's happening around me. I can say that I'm more effective using it, but the side effects are terrible! Always feeling the need to throw up, not being able to eat, always dead tired by the end of the day, being unbelievably shaky and nervous for no reason, and it also links to depression.

I wanted to avoid it if at all possible due to its stigma and popularity on the streets. I regret not trying it sooner because it works wonders for me! I am prescribed 30mg twice daily (i have severe ADHD) and it's really helpful. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I do find if I take it for an extended period of time it becomes less effective, but when that happens i'll stop taking it for about a week or two and it will go back to working like a charm. I'm so glad I am prescribed it, every aspect of my life has improved since taking Adderall. it made my ADHD easier to manage, my social life better, my marks increased significantly, and helped basically every negative symptom that comes with having ADHD. One downside I will mention, it is very expensive.

The first drug my psychologist prescribed me was  straterra, which is a non stimulant. I was suppose to take it 3 weeks but after 2 & 1/2 weeks I decided that was enough. I absolutely hated it ! It made me nauseated & constipated. It made me very tired, but I still couldn't sleep. It was not helping me concentrate and put me in a terrible mood. I went back to my psychiatrist and was prescribed adderall xr generic brand by Barr. It's amazing ! It's puts me in a great mood, I'm able to concentrate, and I'm not experiencing many side effects. Only thing I notice is it doesn't really last as long as it's suppose to. I work in a fast paced environment and I'm constantly running around dealing with patients which speeds up my metabolism and makes it wear off pretty fast. Also the first morning I took it I had to take 2 otc sleeping pills which I didn't feel until hours later. It's day 3 now and it was busy at work so it wore off fast. I got home and was ready to sleep, but here it is 2:10 am and I'm up reading on side effects lol. So besides the lack of sleep and appetite loss it's awesome so far !!

I don't have much of the hyperactivity but it simply allows me to concentrate on one thing at a time, something that I didn't know was even possible. I was drinking insane amounts of caffeine prior to starting which I found out was a way to self medicate. I don't take it everyday, only those that I need full concentration on items. The only drawbacks that I have found is I don't like eating after I take it, I grind my teeth and periodically have problems sleeping. Beyond that it is AWESOME!

However I found myself in a terrible slump last month, binge eating, anxiety attacks and all I wanted to do was sleep. Then one morning I accidentally took a double dose (40 mg).  Immediately my depression disappeared and I was able to get off my couch on the weekends and didn't dread going in to work.Since then I have been taking 30mg in the a.m. and 10-20mg in the afternoon. I have an appt. with my doc. in a few weeks to discuss this, but I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and if so what did you do?

I have lost some weight, I have gotten VERY organized, I don't constantly think about when I will get to sleep. It takes about an hour for me to feel ""awake"", and for me, it only lasts about 2-3 hours. So, I break the 30 mg Adderall in half and take half at 7am, half at 12pm and try not to take any more. [The more you take, the more quickly your body adjusts to it and it seems like it doesn't work anymore.]. I try to NOT take it as often as possible. It is good to take a day off/week. Ask your doctor if you could take ""Nuvigil"" for your day off Adderall. It is nice to be able to feel ""normal"" and not totally exhausted. Just try to take as little as possible.

These are used (and NEEDED) to help so many people with serious issues of ADHD - yet, they (Teva) is allowed to sell products with the FDAs blessing that the drug can be 20% LESS EFFECTIVE than the Brand Name??  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!  

If you are perscribed 30mg XR - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and INSIST with your Dr. on getting the brand name (SHIRE) instead of this TEVA Generic GARBAGE!!  Cannot belive the FDA allows this (wonder how much they are getting paid to look the other way)!!!

I have been off of the med for at least a week and I'm considering going back to taking it maybe a few times a week, to see if it will work better that way and I don't build up a tolerance again.

Before I started taking it, I was pretty much at wit's end. Finally was diagnosed with ADHD, after going through dozens of doctors. Immediately, it changed my world. 
I could actually focus, concentrate, and complete a task.Impossible before. I doubt I would have kept my job if I didnt start the med when I did. Pre-Adderal...anxiety, frustration, mind always going day or night, trouble having/holding conversation,no concentration, constantly distracted, all making me very stressed, it was a horrible way to live. i started at 10mg twicw a day, increasing slowly over the next 4-5 mons..until now, currently at max dose of 20mg, 3 times a day.My med dr actually wanted to increase to 80 mg per day, but there was an issue with insurance that was being worked out. It worked great and consistantly at each dosage, but eventually after few weeks to maybe month and half i notice my symptoms coming back. Watch for side effects- i am very active, but there was pretty quick weight loss. i think i am at 30-40 lbs lost in 4 months, im working up to 70 hrs a week, on this med 16 hr days are no prob. also i had no appetite, my mind has slowed quite a bit, i now seem to have aggressive tendecies, recently constant anger, paranoia. im like a different person. i also take with effexor, the combination was so great until recently. while it is helping in so many ways the changes have not been a problem until recently.

My life so busy, yet never seemed to accomplish anything day in and day out.Start something then see something else needing done as I am doing the first thing I started, next thing I knew I had many things started and nothing completed. I didn't seem to ever have a lot of energy/felt tired and moody. My then doctor said I was depressed. He tried several different antidepres.(not all at once).  Nothing worked, I don't like taking pills or anything really so I wasn't taking something that had no benefit in/to me. ADD & ADHD runs on both sides of my family, I knew I was ADD guess I thought I knew how to live with it, I had this far. Long story short I ended up getting prescribed Adderall started a 5mg 3X's day,ended at 20mg 3X's day, have been taking this dose for many years and has changed my life for the positive. I start & finish what I start, I don't put anything off til the last minute, I have the desire/energy to get'er done, my moodiness ""depression""-Gone. I feel like a productive adult! Now years later I drive a commercial bus; DOT Phys/Cert,and Random DT'ing so Adderall has become a pain for me in this respect as DT's come back + and this new DOT Cert. Co requires I get DOT re-cert every 1yr instead of every 2yrs + proof of script to me from my phys. every year..really non-since on their part. I am sure I couldn't be a com. driver if a didn't take this script, I am a better and safer driver taking it. I would stop taking if it didn't make such a positive impact in my life. Cons: must take on regular basis so body adjusts at 1st I didn't & noticed irritable then when I'd take it I'd be jittery (hate both those feelings), must eat or get jitters & headache, don't take last dose to late or you wont sleep. I like to give my body couple days off Adderall a few X's a month(when not working).I have no Neg. side effects I'm aware of. Ur body will have adj period at 1st! "

Adderall is essentially like taking 10 red bulls. It can work for longer periods, but the biggest bonus is the quality of work that I can produce. The reason being, adderall gives me the ability to be able to be much more focused on the material and as a result, I retain it better. There is a downside however. If taken too late in the day, it can keep you awake and sometimes you can feel a bit overstimulated. Another thing to watch for may be a slight change in behaviour. I had family members that hadn't seen me in several months tell me that I seemed too stimulated during regular conversation. In terms of dosage, I personally found 20mg to be more than enough but this varies from person to person. Overall my experience has been great, it has helped me bridge that gap that has kept me from performing like the rest of the students in my classes.

As long as I was excersizing regularly, eating healthy and getting the sleep my body needed, I never felt I needed more than 10 mg. Once I started to slack in my healthy eating and regular excersize, I started to become more sluggish and unfocused and eventually jumped up to 15mg. I don't love how it makes me feel. After 6 months of the 15mg I felt I could use more but decided that I was not going to fall victim so once again, I have been getting back on track with my eating and excersize and have lost 5 pds  and already feel so much better. I do not crave more Adderall so by continuing good healthy habits, i'll see if I need to adjust back to 10 mg or stay on the 15 mg. I've learned that Adderall is not a substitute for unhealthy habits.

It has changed my life for the better.
I am a 35 year old female who my parents didn't believe in me taking drugs like this as a child.I knew I had issues in high school 
and I know for a fact had I been on this medication I would have done better in school
and would have cared about going to college.
I finally did something for myself when I turned 30 and went to a psychiatrist. It took a few different medications(concerta/vyvanse) before my Dr put me on Adderall. One made me so dizzy and one made my heart race. 
I can see getting addicted, but I knew with the way I live my life, I wouldn't have to worry.  
I had major issues staying focused and awake no matter how much sleep I would get. I would get bored easily or start a dozen different tasks and not get one completed. I had no time management.
I started with 20mg and I take it in the am when I wake up at 6 am. It makes me want to do my job and not get stressed. I am much more
organized. It keeps my life on track.
I started getting headaches about 3 months in and just really tired again by 3 pm. When I went to my dr for a check up she decided to
try a half of a 20mg of plain adderall at 2pm.
It did the trick and I've been on this combination ever since and haven't had to change anything.
I go to bed by 10:30 or 11 pm. I hardly ever have trouble sleeping.  My heart doesn't race either.
A plus for me was it helped lose the weight from having my daughter a few years prior. I gained 70lbs and wasn't worried about losing
the last 30lbs but it was an added plus.
I don't have such an appetite loss like I did when I first started.
It helps me with portion control and I don't stuff my face like I used to before I started the medication.
It also helps me have normal bowel movements and regular.
I will tell you if I have to stay up later I do end up irritable and get quiet and just want to crash. That's about the only side effect I've experienced.

Studies are underway in an effort to ID what specific compounds are responsible for these erroneous results. Consult your prescribing physician if this phenomenon occurs, as an alternate regimen may be necessary to prevent this incorrect findings. Consult the warnings section in the latest PDR to learn of any results of these ongoing studies as these studies reach their conclusions. It is also reported that the quality and precision of confirmatory testing may also show these same false positive results.

When I lost a significant amount of weight (due to health changes - NOT the medication), my Dr. thought it might be best to alter my medication system, and for the next year my dose and brand was shuffled around, as a result every pharmacist in town thinks I am some cartel drug dealer. But once on the right dose for your body, Adderall is incredible for those with Attention Deficit. It will not cause shakiness or nervousness. It will have a calming effect while in your system. I can generally think much more clearly and am able to multi-task. If you need Adderall, it will work for you and you will NOT have the same reaction to it as someone taking speed. The medication for someone with ADHD will slow you, in a sense: making it clear and possible to make simple, rational decisions without struggle and giving you the ability to channel your energy and focus on what you need. I take 2 25mg XRs throughout the day, and have an optional add on of 10mg instant release for if I have a lot of homework or my XR wears off (I am a student, and mostly use the extra during exams or if I am writing a last minute essay the night before). I am an 18y/o 115 lb girl and pretty skinny, and this is the dose that works well for me (it deffinately isn't the same for everyone). The only problem I have found with Adderall is that on nights I take the optional 10mg, I have some trouble sleeping. But it's alright, because I don't take it often and usually if I do I need to stay awake that night anyways. However, if you do not have to pull frequent all-nighters, I would recommend never taking Adderall within  4 hours of your bedtime. Other than that, Adderall has provided me with the ability to focus in class, on my friends, after school, and accomplish the things I need to do, without ever getting too distracted or forgetting what I had to do.

806$Condition: Other$4/5/2014 11:37:27 PM$Reviewer: gratefullyfocused, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I am a 54 year old male. I did not put two and two together when ADHD first came to light. It did not take long to realize the connection between ADHD and my younger days. I new years ago when ADHD was medically proven and legitimized (for lack of a better description) that it was my problem. I had learned to deal with it by working harder and longer than others would have to for the same results. I would accomplish what I needed to but where others would do it in an 8 hour work day, I would take it home and spend another 2 to 3 hours to accomplish the same amount of work to have it available at the same time as everyone else. A typical 8 hour day for anyone else was a 10 to 12 hour day for me. (this also helped me understand as an intelligent person the struggles in high school). This system worked for me as I progressed in my career until my latest and highest level management position. It didn't take long for me to realize I had progressed professionally beyond my ability to overcome my focus problems using the system that had gotten me by to this point to overcome the issue. The difference after Adderall has been profound, I have no doubt that had I not discussed the problem with my doctor and began taking Adderall I would have lost the position I now hold. This is coming from someone who at 54 years old was on no prescription medication for anything and proud of that accomplishment.

Took 10mg for about 2 years during the time I wasn't aware what it was what it was supposed to be doing or feel like, it was never explained to me. Then they asked if its working or any side effects after about 2 years I don't know Im just a kid Im thinking about cartoons and stuff and I didnt really take interest or have the knowledge that I was hopped up on speed 24/7 I didnt know because I thought it was how ""normal"" feels so they upped it to 20mg. Around that time I was like a little tweeker rollin all the time, mind going 1000 mph irritability insomnia just plain weird feelings thoughts and emotions I guess the onset of amphetamine psychosis. Then in about middle school I started taking 30mg no one even the doctor was sure it was what we should do just give me an ounce of crystal meth why dont ya. I suppose around that time I became aware of its effects long before then I was completely addicted started snorting it selling empty capsules to buy more by high school I was going through at least 70 mg a day. All of this for a little a.d.d that I could manage without the stimulant especially when I discovered smoking cannabis/weed completely got rid of every negative ailment caused by this despicable byproduct of some money hungry bigot out to make a buck on peoples suffering almost completely rid of my a.d.d and made me feel completely normal again.

I started at 20 mg, and three years later, have to take 40-60mg to get the same effects, but the side effects are completely dreadful....intense mood swings, depression, insomnia, etc.  I just did not feel like myself, but it was still so hard to stop taking the drug.  I still take it once in a while because I have a rigorous class schedule and studying without it is almost impossible.  I am definitely a different person when I'm on it and feel that it has brought more negative than positive experiences into my life.

It should not be required by Medicaid to have brand name and also records from before the age of 12.

I now have so many answers to WHY I have behaved like I have ALL MY LIFE. My first episodes were in 4th grade. At 50+ years young I had no idea that I was ""not normal"". BUT it's ok. There were some adjustments that I had to make for the first couple months, but I trust my Doc. and after 14+ months of taking Amph salts I have discovered and accepted so many life changing traits/behaviors. Don't expect everyone to understand...you have to be here to know or be very trained as is my doctor. Many pharmacy personnel here in Florida have been very rude and upsetting when I fill my script every month. Mom and Pop type pharmacies have treated me very well, like they should! Listen to me, I have been to 15 to 18 PHARMACIES IN ONE DAY AT THE WALGREENS/TARGETS/CVS GOING HOME WITH NOTHING! I understand that inventories run out but the above mentioned pharmacies made me feel like a criminal 75% of the time. Please give your local Mom and Pops a chance, they are honestly hungry to serve you, NOT LIKE THE BIG CHAINS. Too bad I did not grow up around great doctors back in Oklahoma(my guess is great doctors don't want to live in dirty, ugly Okieville;sorry but it's true), I could have had a second bite at life's apple years earlier by growing up around understanding doctors. I now recognize reasons for past failures/behaviors and can see what to change. Adderrall is not a cure just an equalizer and when without it the old actions/behaviors return. Man I had a rough start by my situation being born but it's ok. Don't believe most everyone that says you are LAZY OR CRAZY...IT'S NOT TRUE. I just didn't know I that I was lacking attention.

It was hard to find the right dosing schedule to control my symptoms, and my Dr. and I still make adjustments as needed. Hardest thing was to remember when to take my doses (6am, 9:30am,12:30pm,3pm,5pm). So I set an alarm on my cell. Deffinately keep a sleep diary/ journal with the actual times every when you get-up, take meds, eat, drive, go to bed and sleep. This is the best tool for you and your doctor to refer to (for ANY medication therapy). I feel blessed to have had prescription drug coverage during my diagnosis, but now with Obamacare changes taking effect, my employer will only offer a high-deductible health plan and no drug coverage. I wish there was more drug assistance available out there. In a month or two, I may find myself with a chronic health condition (narcolepsy) and no way to afford treatment. Best yet, Narcolepsy is not considered a disability. Without medications, I won't be able to drive- or work.... Adderall  and Adderall XR do have generics, but the cost is still significant out of pocket, every month. Always price the mom and pop pharmacies before you try the chains, small independants generally have more flexibility with cash pricing than a company whose pricing is set at a corporate level ( and based on average price for your state).

It will have a calming effect while in your system. You will think more clearly and be able to multi-task. I've seen comments saying this is no different than meth or crack. That is inaccurate. If you need Adderall, it will work for you and you DO NOT have the same reaction to it as someone taking speed. If you feel this way and have been diagnosed with ADHD your dose maybe too high or you might be a good candidate for the XR version. My husband's metabolism is too fast for extended release. He takes two doses a day to keep his level stable. This medication actually slows him in a sense. He is still very active but can focus and accomplish tasks effectively.

865$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/4/2013 2:16:09 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$My doctor treated me with the usual anti-depressants - Prozac, Paxil, Lexapro, Klonopin, etc for depression, confusion, lack of self worth, crying.  Finally, my Pain Management doctor, who maintains my drug infusion pump gave me a prescription for Adderall XR.  I immediately noticed an improvement in my mental state.  I had more energy, felt more stable, better concentration, even more able to deal with my chronic pain.  I started on 10 Mg daily and increased over time.  I am now on 40 mg XR daily.  I am certain that I could use another increase, but I prefer stay as low as possible for as long as possible.  I will say that this has been the absolute best medication I have ever been on and the only one that dealt effectively with my depression.  I have never been able to deal with life in such a positive, focused  and calm manner.  I hope I never have to stop taking this medication.  Even my Psychiatrist has noticed the difference in me and he recommends that I continue on this medication.  He said he is willing to prescribe it for me if there should ever be a reason I stop requiring the services of the doctor who prescribes it for me now.  I have been under treatment with the same psychiatrist for 12 years and he agrees that this medicine has been the best prescription for improving my depression and dealing with other very complicated issues in my life.  So, for right now, he says continue the good work and he is very pleased that I have found the correct medication. Over the course of therapy, I have gone from 6 different medications a day down to 2.  I also still take .05 Klonopin at night, if necessary, for anxiety.  I am happy to say that I have never felt better.  I do realize this is an addictive drug, however, it is also a necessary drug for some people and I am one of them.
866$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$12/2/2013 8:30:13 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$2$Began taking 20mg three times a day 2 1/2 years ago. I am 23 and have been off medication for 5 months. Adderall at this dosage increased my heart rate, decreased my appetite, and increased focus. Tasks in school were easy, studying was efficient and listening was second nature. Difficulties lied with eating. In order for me to enjoy a meal, I would need to stay off the med for at least 2 days. After being off the drug for 5 months, I have had better success in  school (no failing grades) and better appetite. However, social skills became worse, reading became difficult, getting a firm grasp of ideas became non existent, confidence decreased, sex drive decreased and wellness decreased. While the benefits outweigh the negatives, the moral aspect of the medication became important. Therefore after serious thought, some kind of ADD med should be taken. This could be a mixture of adderall (for stimulation) with strattera to fill in the gaps.

Since several years had passed by now, I decided to take the ADHD assessment test, and the results were that I'm ADHD, and that's when he started me on the Adderall 10mg twice daily, but the ended up raising the dosage to 20mg twice daily.

About a year ago, I noticed that I was having mild to moderate facial ticks (rapid blinking, nose tick gestures), etc.  I have know for many years that I have a very mild case of Tourette's Syndrome, but for some reason, the Adderall seems to have brought out those symptoms after two years, and not sure why this is happening.  When taking Adderall, I feel normal, active, hopeful and at my full potential -- and I have incredible focus at work.  When I don't take Adderall, I feel just the opposite; lethargic, depressed, and kind of generally overwhelmed with life.  My question is this, has any one else out there that also has Tourette's Syndrome, found a good remedy for this.  A combination drug with Adderall?  A smaller dosage of Adderall?  Currently, I take a 30mg generic, and it is called ""Amphetamine Salts ER 30 mg Cap"", manufactured by Teva/Barr.  I really hate to quit taking this, but near the end of the half life of the dose, the tourrette's syndrome symptoms are getting to the point where it is almost not worth taking.

This is a serious medication with serious side effects,  I am shocked and disgusted that any parent would put a young child on such a strong drug for their ""ADD.""  I began with 20mg a day and had amazing grades while working full time as a bartender, I honestly felt like every time I popped one of these I got a little ""high"" from it and euphoric.  It made me impulsive, impatient, obsessive compulsive, and sometimes anti-social.  I wasn't aware how much this drug changed my personality until the third year I was on it.  I was fully addicted taking only 30 mg at the most in a day, but when the pills went on back order I realized how bad withdrawal sucked from it.  I couldn't leave my bed or do the simplest tasks without popping an adderall for the day.  I also became paranoid, and sometimes would hear things that weren't there, that's when I knew this drug was messing my head up.  I quit taking adderall and it took a good 6 months for me to regain my natural energy. I'm back to my normal, social, happy self.  I think adderall causes serious problems with your body, as I had heart palpitations, poor circulation, weight loss, chest pains, extreme insomnia, and mental instability while on this drug.  PARENTS PLEASE DO NOT PUT YOUR CHILDREN ON THIS DRUG unless you want them to grow up to be full blown drug addicts who resent you for introducing them to what seems to be legal coke or speed."

Hospital bills and other medical costs were escalating, I was once quite healthy, now these issues. My marriage means a lot, so I'm dealing with ADD without medication, and feeling better as a result- and no more EDD. 

Many physicians have different opinions about this medication, it's your responsibility to determine whether this medication is worth it and your overall health."

I'm 53yrs old been taking Adderall 60mgs a day for 3 yrs. prescribed by my doctor. BP After 2hrs taking Adderall 117/76 pulse 68 min. At the beginning my BP WAS 140/90 Pulse 90 beats per min. So once your body gets adjusted to it and you have no history heart disease in the family or high blood pressure this drug(like me with ADD)Will do wonder's. Do not listen to other people's experiences. Especially DO NOT Search the web for chat rooms talking nonsense,jibberish about the drug. If you pay attention to the chat rooms on other people's opinions, you will commit suicide with all the crapola you will hear. Take the recommended dose from your doctor. Do not abuse the drug(snort,inject,taking 5 pills a day instead of 2) and your life will improve. I'm living proof...
890$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/16/2013 4:20:51 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years$5$5$5$I have been on ADD/ADHD medication since I was 7 years old. However, I did not take Adderall until I was 19 years old & it was the right ADD medicine for me. I had tried Concerta during high school & it made me like a zombie. That didn't mean I didn't have ADD/ADHD it just meant I was on the wrong medication. It can be vice versa for other people but my best advice I can give for finding the right ADD medication is you have found the right one if you still feel like yourself. If you are overly hyper or overly inactive, I highly recommend trying a different medication until you find one that you can't tell a big difference in your personality, but makes a big difference in your day.

I like the long lasting version better. There are good and bad effects from the medicine. The good is that you get things done, even if you don't want to. It also suppresses my appetite which is good as I tend to overeat. The bad effects: sometimes I hyper focus or focus too much on the wrong things like playing video games on my ipad or phone. Also, it used to make me want to smoke cigarettes for some reason. I have quit, but I do use e cigs sometimes. Also, I tend to pick at my skin if I am really tired and have taken Adderall. I don't notice a come down most of the time as other people have mentioned. One last thing. I forget that I need to drink water while taking Adderall, because I never get thirsty while on Adderall which is odd. But if I don't hydrate myself, I end up getting a headache .

I often jolted awake from my sleep while taking it, and even if I did sleep okay, I still felt super tired.  I also felt a tad anxious and jittery.  What really bothered me about it was that, in the two hours before I got out of bed every morning, I practically lost control of my thoughts if I wasnât asleep.  My brain kept doing its own thing.  It didnât help with my depression, so I didnât stay on it long.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

I was diagnosed with depression 14 years ago and was prescribed Paxil. After six months of little change in my condition, I was prescribed Prozac and Xanax. Over the next few years, my conditioned worsened. I was eventually prescribed Ambien for insomnia, which was a huge mistake.

I became addicted to Ambien, not for the sleep benefits but for the Utopian feeling it provided me. I would take it several times during the day, and quickly began running out of my prescriptions. This led to ""Doc Shopping,"" and eventually I had three doctors writing me scripts every month.

Long story short: my marriage fell apart, I couldn't hold a job and I reached a point where I didn't care whether I lived or died.

Three years ago, I made an appt. with a young doctor at a university research facility. After describing my medical history and my current condition, he said he believed I suffered from adult ADD. He started me on 10 mg of Adderall daily.

Within two months, I was completely off my depression meds (Cymbalta and Tofrenil) and had no desire whatsoever for the Ambien. 

I have now been taking 30 mg daily for the past year, and am experiencing no addictive drug behavior whatsoever. I was also a daily drinker, and now only drink 1-2 glasses of wine on the weekends. I have held a steady, professional-level job for over three years now, and my marriage has been restored.

Through the grace of God, I was led to a doctor who literally saved my life. This amazing drug has helped make all the difference. If you have been diagnosed with depression and nothing seems to help, you may want to discuss this with your doctor."

The first round ended 2 1/2 yrs ago and it worked great. I took 20mg in the morning and 20mg in the afternoon with very few side effects.  The side effects that I did notice were my blood pressure was on the higher end of 120/80 and my appetite was decreased (not that this is a bad thing).  I have just started back on the therapy again.  I am hoping that it works as well this time.

It works, however I wouldn't suggest it go to just anyone.. Adderall has a severe side effect which happens to almost everyone who takes it. Not eating, its not that you don't want to eat but that your just not hungry, you feel full. Put it like this I'm 21 years old and was about 130 pounds, perfect weight when I took adderall my weight fluctuates alot, I'm not 115. I actually force myself to eat because with adderall you won't eat for days, literally. My sister who is 26 years old and slightly overweight took adderall and lost about 100 pounds in just a 2 months. She looked fantastic, however thats just not healthy. Now my sisters pregnant and she gained all that weight back plus baby weight. Although, it does what its suppose to do you make a choice, Do you want to get rid of a problem to gain another problem? Your decision!

Since beginning it, my family and friends have noticed the organization in my thoughts and reasoning skills. As a college student, I had never had a teacher compliment my organization in a paper until I was medicated; I was so excited to see the comment on a paper I called my parents and nearly cried! Unfortunately I think I need to up my prescription as I am finding my mind wandering more throughout the day, but I am still anxious by the end of the day. I don't know what I would do without Adderall, but I just hope it continues helping like it did in the beginning!

No issues with sleep...but, very easy to abuse...if I needed to get something done, could take late in the day and stay up all night. Advantageous at times but I got out of that mode very quick. Then about 3 weeks, it just quit working. I am tired most of the time and if I try to watch a video that I am interested in, about 15 minutes and I have to go do something else. So this week we will shift to something different....but, it worked great for a long time. I was taking 60mg every morning....

I would start one thing then stop that and start something else....finishing neither task. I became very fidgety and also lethargic as well. My thought process was chaotic. My husband had passed away in January of 2013 and along with the grief from my loss, I also experienced deeper depression. There were things I wanted to do and things I NEEDED to do and just couldn't muster up the energy to do anything. There were many days that I didn't feel like getting dressed, washing up, brushing my teeth or even leaving the house. I also had the added task of finding a job. I remained unemployed during the time of my husband's sickness until his death-about 10 months. I couldn't even MAKE myself do anything! And that was depressing in itself. My doctor tried me on Adderall and it was a godsend! I was up and showered and dressed every morning, got caught up on housework, began the job hunt and became more social. I hope she never takes me off of it!

I wish I had it when I was in school. I was labeled as a problem kid. Lazy,  always  in trouble. In the remedial classes in most subjects. Could not pay attention to things that were not interesting to me. Age 44 is when I was given my first dose of adderall. My kids were taking it for ADD. My doctor was treating me with anti depressants with no real results. He gave me a simple test to take in his office. Switched me to adderall to see if things in my life improved. With in just a few days I noticed Hugh improvements in my life. I was able to do things that I could never do before. Like understanding what I had just read, being able to focus on things that were always a challenge to me,so I avoided them. I could understand new concepts and enjoyed learning for the first time in my life. Before I struggled with following basic instructions and would get frustrated and just give up.  For me it was a new life that I could enjoy and be present and be part of things I was scared to get involved in. For fear that others would think I was slow or challenged. Adderall change my whole life for the better. I wonder where I would be today if I had been given this drug in my early school years. I own a very successfully catering business and I'm happy with my life. I will always wonder what I could have accomplished if I was given the right treatment when I was in school.

As a nurse working nights on a very busy floor that I truly Love & Self Employed Auto Dealership ,  I became more & more scatter brained & stressed due to the inability to stay focused.  Adderall has made life so much better, in that I can focus & get things done as I once did with out all the stress & un organized state of mind.  It has not caused me to have weight loss, infact I have gained & maintain with difficulty to loose weight.  I sleep well when I do sleep & it is just such a miracle drug for me.  I notice when I have taken vacations from it , I can not think for myself & I can NOT stay still long enough  when trying to sit at my desk to get work done.   I am very concerned about the ability to get COMPLETELY off this drug & function as I should.  Haven't got that far yet but will surely let you know when or if I do.   Important need of Adderral for me is that is slows me down MENTALLY so that I can properly function & think as I should in orders to focus & concentrate on very important & large amounts of work.  I was told by my doctor I was a TRUE canidate for this drug & I must agree.  I have Never been on any medication in my life.  This is the first & I am 51 years old.

It worked wonders of my focus is school and controlled my hyperactivity really well for the most part, but the side effects were just too much. Heart palpitations, no appetite whatsoever and nausea, but the worst by far was the anxiety. I would have four or five panic attacks a week just from tiny things like homework, and it drove me crazy. I ended up switching medications a couple months ago, and I'm doing much better now.

In the beginning it had improved my attention span majorly, and I was able to concentrate for much longer periods of time without letting my thoughts distract me. I started noticing that after taking it for awhile it was not working as well as it did at first because I was becoming more tolerant to it, this meant I had to increase my dose. I try to give myself a ""medication vacation"" at least one day a week, usually a lazy day, but i noticed now when i dont take it, I literally cannot function well at all, all I want to do is lay in bed all day. This medication has also caused me to lose over 50 pounds in about 10 months because my appetite decreased so much from it. Now I am down to about 105 pounds and I am a 23 year old female about 5'5"", so this is defintely not a healthy weight for me. So I would say this medication definitely has its pros and cons.

I started taking the NAME BRAND Adderall a few months afterwards because I thought maybe the side effects were from the fillers because I am very sensitive to some medications.  I was able to concentrate and focus and become a normal person but again, slowly but surely, my eyelashes started to fall out and my eyes were dry but not as bad as on the generic brand--the dry eyes I could have tolerated, but I had to stop the Adderall or lose my hair on my head and eyelashes.

Believe me, I understand the challenges associated with both the stigma associated with ADHD generally and this medication specifically, but I promise that if this treatment is as effective for you as it was for me you'll kick yourself for waiting so long to try it (just like I did)!

But with Adderall I've always come back to. Why? Because it works! I am now on 60mg a day. I have found that I am able to do menial tasks like housework, stay on task for helping my 11yo with homework, stay on task for craft projects and am able to keep a cool head when amongst stressful situations. Also I am playing darts in leauge and when it comes to state darts or any tournament, you can tell when I am have not taken my dose properly. I do need however my iPod when playing as well. I do not have an appetite and do sometimes stress eat, but I have been able to take better control my eating. With Adderall I have been able to take back my life, instead of this condition take control of me. I reccomend this medication for anyone who cannot find the right med for them. What's the  worst that will happen? It won't work? Oh well try try try again! Hope this was helpful to someone.

Life changing for me! I allows me to focus on my paper work, greatly improves my attitude towards work (I used to procrastinate to the extreme), solved my anxiety (I feel it drew a curtain in my mind between tasks constantly thinking about and what I am doing at the moment), I used to think about sex all the time (it solved that I only think about it when I am in bed with wife but don't feel it has to happen), I feel my poor memory has improved slightly and focus is awesome. I love this drug and appreciate what it has done for me....made me more normal and competent. thanks you much

My depression started at an early age. I had my first child on my 18th birthday & my second 18 months later. I had cervical cancer & had a partial hysterectomy @ age 26. In 2003 @ the age of 15 my only son was killed in a horrific alcohol related auto accident. My brother was the driver. 
I lost interest in everything.I lost everything.I cut myself off from even my best friend. I turned to drugs & alcohol(which I swore to NEVER do after the life I endured)for about 3 yrs. YES I wanted to die, but never once thought of suicide. One day I just decided I had enough & quit all the nonsense. I did not seek help until 7 yrs after his death. I am now 43. Since I was a teen I noticed I had problems concentrating, seeing things through to the end, lack of interest. Daily headaches, some leading to migraine. Multiple projects going at once. Occasional panic attacks & anxiety. I am so O.C.D. about certain things that I get on my own nerves. The panic attacks & anxiety have progressed over the years so I take xanax as well.  After trying several anti depressants that NEVER worked. & after seeing the results my daughter had with the Adderall, I asked to try it. It has made such a difference in my life. I can actually concentrate long enough to complete what I start. I have found my passion for my art again. All this time & All the different medications I have tried, people tell me it is a miracle cure for me & can attest to the fact that I feel like a NORMAL human being for once in my life..........I am extremely scared to death of this medication though.... I NEVER want to go back to whoever I was before Adderal Yet I don't want to become dependant on it & have to take it forever....rock & a hard place on this one...It is only thing I have found that actually works yet the aspect of the methamphetamine scares me.

My Psychiatrist turned things around out of lack of any more ideas, and treated my ADHD as my primary diagnosis.
The results have been amazing.  Adderall stops the anxiety and panic attacks completely.  Unfortunately, it's a very short-acting medication with me, so I only get 3 hours of relief from it.  Those 3 hours are worth it, just to be able to breathe after many years of constant anxiety.
ADHD makes it difficult for me to finish any tasks, clean my house, or take care of pressing paperwork. All of this leads to extreme anxiety, then depression.  By treating the ADHD first, I am able to focus more, get some things done, and the anxiety and depression over it all lessens.  
Dependence is definitely an issue... you must be careful to take it only as directed.  I take it every other day or so, when I need to focus, and trying not to become dependent. When I do take it every day, I can feel myself needing it more often, as the anxiety gets worse.
It's not perfect, but I finally have some relief from depression and anxiety after 20 years."

I'm in graduate school and ever since I was younger I always had to study 2-4 times harder than everyone else just to get the same grade.  I was constantly losing everything, forgetting what I had been doing, and forgetting important things/events.  Now I've been taking a generic adderall and my life is so much easier.  I have spent less time studying and am finally able to organize things without getting distracted every 5 min.  Adderall is not good for everyone with ADHD and different treatments are available.  After my experience on medication, I would recommend that people with ADHD at least try some sort of medication.  All of my friends who have ADD/ADHD take medication and are just fine.  There are some side effects, but those are generally mild and go away after some time.  All in all, adderall has helped me a lot in graduate school, and I don't think I would be able to finish without it.

It helped alleviate probems such as chronic generalized anxiety,panic attacks and bouts of depression (all disorders that physicians had been trying to ease with various prescriptions for years).  With Adderall, I find myself simply pushing past the anxiety and panic. I have always been a perfectionist and this med does lend to occasional OCD, but so far, this has been managable.
I have also had insomnia since I was a child and presently take Seroquel at bedtime so that I'm able to sleep. Prescribed sleeping pills have not worked. Since Seroquel is known for weight gain, I have not enjoyed the weight loss I have heard others on Adderall describe.  I have recently tried Valerian Root and Melotonin with some positive results. Any other suggestions? Overall, Adderall has been a lifesaver - the positive effects far outnumber the negative ones."

But then comes the late night mood-swings, the emotional volatility, the destruction of relationships, the loss of your job, the depression. If you're on it, get off. Take the short acting 20mg and wean yourself off over 6 months. It's like a new world when you're not on it. It's a better world-one where you can be yourself.

Can't believe what a difference it makes. My husband used to 'poo-poo' me...you are lazy, just focus, why can't you get anything done? I thought I was losing my mind. Was tested for ADD/ADHD by a psychiatric doctor who said I was anxious and depressed and prescribed Xanax....that made me sleepy and more disconnected. 

Finally found a nurse practitioner who recognized my symptoms right away. Sitting in her office, I couldn't even keep my feet/legs still....always felt as if I needed to be doing something!! Within three days, I couldn't believe the difference. I can focus at work, I can listen to a conversation without having my mind race at all the 'things' I need to complete. Just wish I would have had this in college...a lot of my professors thought I was just a scatterbrain...
One of the best commercials on TV was my ah-ha moment. A woman is sitting in a conference room--in a meeting with many others. The camera focuses on her face and she has thoughts racing through her mind, the announcer says...""her mind is like a television that can't find the right channel"" shows constantly changing channels/commercials...Oh my...that is me...!! I knew I needed to find someone to help me. If this sounds like you...search until you find a health care provider that will listen. The first doc I saw, made me think there was something seriously wrong with me, even after all the ADHD tests. The Nurse Practitioner diagnosed me at the first visit. 
I have no issues with this medication, no shaking or nervousness...the opposite effect actually. One complaint, it is amphetamine  salts...there is a 'salty' taste in my mouth--occasionally. I drink lots of water during the day, that seems to help. "

There was always so little time! Now Keep in mind I was aware I had ADD and ADHD for many years prior to making the decision to try medications. I strongly believe in mind over matter, and over the years I learned how to function and get things done, completed school, however everything seemed to take me soooo much longer, I worked so HARD to get the grades I got but was I was determined. With out medication I was Anxious all the time I was all stressed about what needed to be done but, but never felt like I was getting anything anywhere. I didn't understand everyone had the same 24 hours in a day, racing thoughts kept me up at night, I felt like I was spinning out of control! The first day I took Adderall it had never felt more calm and quite in my head I am sleeping better, I feel less anxious it has been wonderful in that aspect but like all drugs I do struggle with the side Effects and finding a balance in my medication as well as questions with stimulants and conception/ pregnancy. Over all I am very grateful for this treatment I have lots of questions concerns about going off of it for pregnancy, I work FT and prior to taking meds I had learned function with my crazy abnormal pathways in my head but now with out meds will I be lost in my own head!

I've always had a hard time in school, but I really noticed it whenever I got into college. No matter how much I studied I couldn't seem to retain any information. About a year ago I went to my doctor and found out I have ADD. I never knew I had it until I looked back at my childhood and all the way to me now as an adult. I was put on adderall 20mg twice a day my life actually became normal. For the first time in my life I actually heard a clock ticking while talking to family. My ability to stay focused and on task was just the best feeling in the world. My life has very organized and I can hold interest in studying, my work, as well as my social life. The only downfall about adderall was that it had an extreme supression of my appetite and I had no extra weight to lose. After I would come down off of my doseage I get very irritable, not sure if it's a side effect from the drug or the fact I work 3rd shift as a police officer and rarely sleep good. But overall this has been a blessing to me and my ability to do better at work and at home. If I only had this when I was a young kid and in school I believe my grades would have been out of this world!

Up until a year ago, it helped A LOT. I suddenly got good grades, more social, and felt great about myself. This past year, I noticed it wasn't giving me the same awesome effects. So, I started taking half of one extra, for that extra boost. Half of one became 4. Yes, I was taking 7 to 8 a day. This went on for about 9 months. My seasonal depression turned into major depressive disorder and I'm diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, chronic insomnia, major depression, mild schizophrenia, and amphetamine psychosis. Moral of my story: If you enjoy becoming addicted to a drug, seeing and hearing stuff, paranoid, depressed, aggressive, and losing everyone close to you, go for it. For everyone else, DO NOT TRY/USE ADDERALL!!! And if you do, for god's sake, DO NOT ABUSE IT! YOU'LL BECOME MENTALLY CRAZY.
1094$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$9/28/2012 1:01:43 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$5$"I was diagnosed with ADD (not ADHD) in early August 2012 when I finally decided to get checked out for it, and I'm taking 10mg twice daily. The pros: I am now less ""socially awkward"", I'm more motivated and concentrated, it boosts my mood (which is a HUGE plus considering I have chronic depression), I feel confident in my abilities to do things, and I enjoy things I once never enjoyed, which was just about everything. The cons: weight loss (I don't realize I'm not eating because it depletes your appetite), strange ""crawling""/ itching sensation when I begin to come down from it at night (anyone else with this sensation? It's not listed anywhere as far as side effects go), almost impossible to fall asleep at night if I take it too late in the day.
Although the cons may seem like more than the pros, the cons are very tolerable and can be relieves such as taking a non habit forming sleep aid (Zzzquil works great!) and if you absolutely aren't hungry while taking it, drink an ensure shake once a day or take vitamins daily to ensure you don't become malnourished, (butter pecan flavored ensure tastes pretty good). It also has a habit of causing your body to develop a tolerance, so if you want to avoid taking massive doses in the future, I recommend going a day or two (or three!) without taking it. Specifically on days where you don't have to accomplish anything. This (should) help prevent developing a tolerance and make sure that you get the full effect. Overall, I am very, VERY happy with this medication."

Then recently after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I was referred to a psychologist for ADD testing which can be affiliated with fibromyalgia. I was then diagnosed with ADD and was put on 10 mg of adderall twice daily. It has done absolute wonders for me. Taking it early enough in the morning and once again around noon keeps me from being up too late. My mood is always heightened and I am very motivated and not overwhelmed. The only downfall is that of a rare side effect, which would be once the adderall starts to wear off, I get the sensation of bugs crawling all over my skin. It scared me at first because my first impression was that it could be bed bugs or scabies, but after both were ruled out, I learned it is a rare and unspoken side effect of this drug, which has been controlled by a low dosage of atarax, which is an antihistamine primarily. and the nice thing about it is that it helps me sleep at night! Anyone else seem to have that bizarre sensation once it gets later in the day and the adderall is wearing off?

Good news is that it works wonderfully in managing the symptoms. The bad news is that you have to watch how your appetite is affecting your eating habits, usually you won't be hungry until the medicine wears off and you might find yourself malnourished if you're not careful. Also note that you can develop permanent 'tics' or compulsive repetitive behaviors. I have developed a tic of chewing on the side of my tongue. I am now pregnant and cannot take the medication for obvious reasons and yet I still chew on my tongue, but that being said, it isn't severe enough to prevent me from retaking it after my pregnancy because the ADHD is definitely worse than the side-effects of the Adderall. However, every person is different so maybe for other people these 'tics' and appetite changes might not seem so minor. Overall though I have found it very useful and it has made a huge and mostly positive difference in my life, so if you're thinking about trying it to treat your ADHD then I'd say go right ahead.

I had seen the shows of abuse by parents with this medication. This medication, although, not used for ADHD, for me, allowed me to feel like I wanted to get up and live my life. I have only been on it for less than 6 months but I feel it saved my life by giving me the kick in the butt someone else might get from coffee. Nothing worked for me, complete loss of energy until I started the Adderall Oral. It is mentioned as a treatment for severe depression and I refuse to feel bad for using a medication that made me want to live again. It's not magic, I still have to think positive, not focus on the negative but I'm so thankful this medication serves more than one ailment."

During the day, I was a complete zombie. don't me wrong, it worked. I focused and did my work, but from last period to about 7 O'clock I was a complete wreck. I would get angry, and cry. I'd have MASSIVE headaches everyday and when I did my homework i'd get impatient, cry somemore and just feel hopeless. upset that I couldn't do my work like I could the rest of the day and get re-angry when someone tried to help me with it. I've given up on medication and am a firm believer that you can overcome this by yourself. Jst a strong will power,and dedication to success.

I used to be so unorganized, with my manic thinking and racing thoughts and insomnia, as well as being so extremely uncomfortable in any and all social situations. Now I am able to function in daily life and have a daily routine I stick too as well; by feeling comfortable in my own skin and before having no self confidence, now I see myself as attractive and young and intelligent and full of potential. 

When put on this medication by my doctor - after being on every anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, mood stabilizers and benzodiazapines, etc; since the age of 4 and am now 29 - I now feel that I have finally found the one psychiatric drug that has actually helped me in my life. Not just with my Adult Add, but also with my Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder and Bi-Polar I Disorder and lack of concentration, focus and energy to complete tasks. This drug is a life saver...that is no joke!!! Constant catatonic depression for over a year and being pulled out of it and having your lust for life back, is a gift from the Gods!"

I would bounce from task to task, and realized that this was the first job that I had to sit and focus.  Having started this med, I can focus, finish what I start without feeling like I have to move or do something else.  In meetings I can remember what was said, because I actually pay attention, I'm not checking my phone or drawing.  Even my coworkers have noticed that I am much more ""quiet"" (they don't know my condition).  The best part...my head is quiet.  When I first started this med, I felt slow and didn't understand how the rest of the world functioned thinking this slow...to me they were the one with the problem.  Not my fault they couldn't keep up :)  My relationships have gotten better, I actually listen and let them finish speaking.  I'm still busy but I actually get stuff done, and that is the best part.  It's not pieces at a time are completed, the whole thing is completed.  Also, I still get hungy, just full on less food.  But I do drink TONS of water everyday due to the cotton mouth side effect.  Minor annoyance compared to the greatness that is taking place.  I highly recommend this med to anyone that has ADD/ADHD.  You don't lose who you are, just a better more pulled together you shines through."

I have noticed a HUGE difference in effectiveness and side effects depending on manufacturer.

All generic XR is supposedly manufactured by the brand name manufacturer under ""authorized generics"", this may be true, but I have tested them back to back and there is a EXTREMELY noticable difference in effectiveness, and difference in the side effects and way you feel. Barr seems to be the better of the generics, even though Barr and Duramed (duramed is name brand)are both divisions of Tera.

All in all Adderall has let me reach my potential in school and everyday tasks requiring focus/concentration. "

It has really helped with my inatentiveness and I don't have the extreme highs and lows nor do I feel like crap when i dont take it like I have with other stimulant medications. The only drawback to this medication is it causes constant spotting. Ive been spotting every day since I started the medication even if I don't take it on the weekends or if I'm on vacation the spotting is still present. It's a small price to pay for a medication that ""normalizes"" your cognitive functioning. "

During this time, I was treated with xanax(alprazolam) tablets which, as directed, I took 3x a.day. Over these years I was at a dose of up to 6 mg per day. I tried one time foolishly to just stop taking it and was put in the hospital the following day, unaware that I was going through serious and potentially life-threatening issues. Then, lure and behold, in 2009, the dr who I continue to see suggested that I actually seemed to be suffering from adult add. He immediately placed me on adderall. It has been a life changing med and is the sole reason that I.am now free from the addictive grip of xanax. Well, I am now almost totally off of benzos and currently working down from only a 5 mg diazepam...1/2-1 twice daily. Its so nice to be medicated appropriately and arty the same time, I am no longer a slave to anypill. :)))

I am now a junior in high school and still take it daily for school. When I started taking Adderall it was the 5mg IR before school every day. A very low dosage for an 8 year old but it did help. Since then I changed to 10 mg ER somewhere in later middle school when I was either 13 or 14. Just this year I increased to 20 mg ER before school with 10 mg IR after school in order to help focus on homework. The adderall has been invaluable for me in helping me focus both during school and out, as well as lowering my impulsivity since it gives me that second reaction time before I say something or do something I shouldnât. The only side effect Iâve ever noticed is that I do have a decrease of appetite when on the pill and once it wears off Iâm ravenously hungry. However, once on the medication for 5 days or so that symptom has gone away and I end up hungry again. Overall I would recommend it to anyone with ADD or ADHD.

Yes, it keeps me awake but the side affects, to me, are not worth it.  I had severe loose bowel movements, slight headaches, shakiness, VERY IRRITABLE AND ADJITATED at every little thing.  Became cold to the world and everyone in it.  Sore throat, and severe rash on my chest that still hasn't gone away after almost 2 weeks off the adderall.  I was very sensitive to anything that seemed loud....things that I normally wouldn't think was loud.  Fighting with my own mind and my family constantly.  Tightness in my thumbs, yeah WEIRD.  Sore tongue and the list goes on. Also, even though I was awake, I had absolutly NO MOTIVATION AND WOULDN'T EVEN COMPLETE A SIMPLE CHORE.  My mood has gotten better since off of this and I would never recommend it to anyone.  But I know each medication is different for everybody. Hey, if I didn't have the HORRIBLE side affects I would still take it because it did keep me from excessive sleep.  Now went to a neuropsychiatrist and he put me on Nuvigil, which I have heard GOOD AND UGLY news about, but can't even try it because my insurance won't cover it.  Now, back to the doc tomorrow to get my script for ritalin and am totally scared because the rates on that med. don't seem any better than the adderall. But, you never know it may work for me.  I can only pray. Just wanted to share my story in case any of you have had these side affects I would immediatly stop.

1186$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$2/12/2012 1:14:38 PM$Reviewer: BreezieBoo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$To begin, I've never had an issue with addiction or drug abuse. I'm a college senior with a GPA of 3.6. I LOVE my classes and professors, but I can't pay attention as well as I wished. I found myself drinking insane amounts of coffee just to try and stay focused. I couldn't get through more than 4 pages in a book without having to reread it again. The worst part was, I had absolutely no motivation to do any schoolwork away from school (which used to not be a problem at all.) So, a few weeks ago, a classmate told me she was prescribed Adderall for the last 14 years, but stopped taking it, and selling it to make a quick buck. I had already researched ADD and ADHD and self diagnosed myself. I cut a 20mg pill in half, and didn't feel any difference at all. I waited a day or 2 and tried a full 20mg dose. 30 minutes later or so, I then found myself reading normally again, I was motivated to do things I had put off for weeks, I didn't get bored doing normal everyday things, and I didn't feel like I was moving at a million miles a minute (like I read people felt earlier.) I don't know when or if it even stopped working. I took it around 7pm and went to bed, no problem, at midnight (my typical bedtime) without any issues. I know that I don't HAVE to take it every day at all, but my days off when I want to just sleep and be lazy, I take  just ONE 20mg pill around noon after I have been up for a few hours, and I am far more productive than I have ever been in years. I'm not sure how to go about talking to a doctor about my self-diagnosis, or if there are any other similar medicines that could possibly be prescribed without the overly judged and criticized name Adderall attached to it. Not sure if that helps anyone, but I do see a positive change definitely. I wouldn't use it habitually or for an extended amount of time.

I once was at a standstill in College, always wanting class to be over, never paying attention, ditracted and over stimulated by the smallest noises; I would find myself obsessing about the tapping of a pencil, rather than the professor. As a result, my grades suffered, self-esteem suffered,  and I wanted to give up. I was prescribed adderall xr my sophomore year in College and I literally noticed a dramatic difference immediately. My grades went from a 2.4 and have remained at a 3.6. I do not recommend for long term use.

I periodically develop tolerance to Adderall, as well, but a short ""drug vacation"" recovers its effectiveness.  This can make things a bit unpredictable, which is one reason I downgraded its ease of use.  The other is that, just because a few bad apples chose to abuse this and similar drugs, I have to get a written prescription, every single time; no refills, no phone-ins.   So, most of the difficulties with the drug are legal, not pharmaceutical. "

However, when I moved and obtained a new doctor, he did not feel comfortable prescribing that dosage because of it being a controlled substance. Instead he switched and cut me off completely which caused severe depression and no motivation to do anything. When I asked about an extended release version so I wouldn't have the roller coaster effect he pursuaded me to try Concerta and Zoloft together instead... and let me say that it does not work for me (even after 2 months). I feel like I'm in my own world often and analyze everything way too much... Please someone tell him to listen to his patient and get off the adderall judging bandwagon. It does work for some patients, just saying.

She had been on Clonidine but it wasn't helping. It made her very tired so the point of her sitting, staring, nearly drooling on herself. When she started Adderoll it took a week to see real results, but it worked pretty well. She did have some issues with losing weight at first, but over time she gained back to the ""normal"" range. After almost a year of being on it, it became less effective. She started having violent outbursts, hurting herself and us, screaming, unable to pay attention, and very sad / crying often. I think for a while we had a good run, but when it was over it was OVER. It was like night and day how dramatically she changed when it stopped working. Also it is exteremly hard to find in the 5mg dose she was on. Had to drive to another town to get it. We're starting Ritalin now, hope it works better and for longer."

(i also suffer from diagnosed OCD)after high school, i found myself breaking up my family & the life we had going for us, just so i could live my life on the edge with alcohol, pills, & sex. all because i was bored with life & i needed the adrenaline rush to stimulate my mind & body. i was officially diagnosed with ADD without hyperactivity at the age of 23 & started off with Ritalin, which didn't even touch my ADD. i'm finally taking what i wanted all along.. Adderall. i now take 30mg twice a day & it has made all the difference in the world. i can finally focus on tasks at hand, i have the motivation & energy to get things done, and people & things don't irritate me as badly as they did before. side effects? it does give you an addictive ""high"" that's supposedly comparible to cocaine, so i do see the potential for abuse. it causes insomnia for me if taken too late in the day or if i double my dosage, but i can take my next dose that morning & run like i had a full-night's sleep. i was 143lbs when i started taking Adderall (which is the biggest i have EVER been in my life, due to eating for comfort after the death of my sister) but i am now 126lbs after 3-4 months of being on Adderall. i literally have no appetite anymore.. unhealthy & i know this BUT i honestly love seeing my lbs drop. also makes my heart race at times & can be somewhat alarming, especially since my heart rate is on the high side anyways. the major issue i have had (that i haven't seen from other users) is my OCD is worse than ever now. maybe i'm focusing TOO much & that triggers my OCD? other than that, i think the benefits outweigh the side effects. thank you Adderall. sorry for the long story, but i hope my experience helps & someone else can relate :)"

I have a history of procrastination, lack of motivation, organized chaos and extreme fatigue/tiredness accompanied by worrying and anxiety.  I was treated for anxiety to start, pristiq.  Once, under control, My doctor started with a low dose of adderrall increased by 5 mg a day until I reached the point where I felt focused, locked in on my work and time seemed to fly by.  I reached 20 mg and maintained for 30 days.  The results where amazing.  I can't believe I went my whole childhood without this diagnoses.  Anyways, upon my evaluation my doctor ""upgraded"" me to vyvanse stating that it has a cleaner smoother release and I should benefit more.  The first day I felt like I was on cocaine.  I had lock jaw, grinding my teeth and felt like i was high which kept coming and going.  I gave it 2 weeks and had to quit.  My doctor switched me back to extended release adderrall and I'm symptom free.  My ADHD is under control and I'm functioning much better at work and home.  Eating was one of my coping mechanisms before so the decreased appetite was a welcome.  To combat, I keep lots of fruit, yogurt, veggies and nuts on hand.  My general physician introduced me to a book called ""Driven to Distraction"" which helped me understand my condition, the different variations, as well as ways to combat.  For me, exercise and to do lists are my keys to success.  Recently, I tried stopping pristiq to see if my anxiety was just a result of the ADHD but found I have a combination condition.  I wouldn't have understood this without reading the book so I highly recommend in addition to adderrall xr. "

ADHD Im diagnosed with by some phychiatrist. Other phychiatrist i have been evaluated by say i don't have it. They all have MD after there names so who is correct and who's incorrect??...I've been off and on adderall for 8 years. Im 28 years old. Yes it helps me concentrate. Yes, it helps motivate me. Yes, it even makes me feel better about myself...however adderall is extremly addictive, so thats the biggest issue with it. This is a med that is in high demand among society and can kill if it falls into the wrong persons hands. Drug users feel great euphoria and energy when they use it, simply put; thats why they use it. Prescription drug abuse is sky rocketing like never before. So parents keep that in mind.---SO-- The fact remains adderall helps a ton with certain people. If you plan to take it here are a few tips (not that im a dr.) 1)If you have a prior substance abuse problem, FORGET adderall 2)Take it exactly how directed by MD. 3)Keep it in a place thats secure, kids know ALL about adderall. 4)Keep an eye on your pulse, BP, and heart rate. The worst side effect i've expericed is becoming anxious on it. I am just trying to give a down to earth review, and i hope it helps some of you.

I'm a 25 y/o male that was diagnosed with ADHD 3 years ago. I took adderall (30mg, 2x day) for the first 2 years and it worked well for the most part; there were two problems though. For one, if you forget to take your second dose when you're supposed to, you're going to notice...at least I did. Secondly, god-forbid I took my morning dose on an empty stomach; I'd feel really jittery and my mind would race at 100mph. Overall though, it did it's job. I ended up switching doctors at the VA (I'm a vet) and my new doc mentioned dexedrine. I was reluctant to try them, but he put on me on 2x10mg spansules in the morning and 2x10mg tabs in the afternoon. Here I am a year later a lot happier with the results. The onset is smoother, it's easier to eat on it and there are no ups-and-downs. I recommend looking into dexedrine for anyone who runs into these problems with adderall...Also, dexedrine is a lot cheaper than adderall. Generic 10mg IR tabs cost about $.27 each, while the 10mg spansules are 2.16each."

Finally I can focus on what I am doing and can start a new task w/o any delays. No euphoria, no spikes of anger, no other strange effects which some people are reporting.
The only side effects I am experiencing are:
- lost couple of pounds. Went from 280 to 230 in 4 months.
- No high blood pressure. Was on max dosage of Lotrel (and had 150/100 anyway), now not taking pills anymore and have 130/80
- Type 2 diabetes, was about to switch to insulin. Not taking any drugs anymore - blood sugar level stays in up to 115 for the last 3 months (instead of way over 250 with pills)
Most probably all of them are related to the weight loss, but I like it this way. :)

BTW. Don't know why, but Vyvance does not work for me... Just FYI."

About a half hour after I pop them, my heart will start pounding and hurt incredibly. Often, when remaining still, my legs or arms will go numb. I feel dizzy and weak all the time. I will also get severe chest pain and back aches. I do not sleep, and if I do, I sleep at the most one hour during the day. Concerning eating habits, I don't eat much and have lost a lot of weight. My withdrawals are hell, and unexplainably miserable. I feel sad, tired, hungry, bored, and hopeless. I will admit that these pills possess most of my thoughts. If I don't have multiple pills on me at all times, I feel very uncomfortable. Therefore, I at least need to have pills on me for the next time I need to take some.

So for us that truly need this suffer the most.  Maybe schools should b addressing problem.  Torturing ADHD suffers DOES NOT deter. Drug abusers, it only makes them use the XR or Ritalin DUH.

He was very implulsive with his behavior always ""acting before he thinks"", grades at school were very inconsistant. He was failing to ""grow out"" of certain behaviors. 
Since starting Adderall ER 20 mg a month ago the change in him is amazing. He is now able to read on grade level, make good choices and is more socially confident. This drug was our missing link for him, we were doing everything possible for him and it all came together once we added the medicine. He is no longer receiving supportive reading services at school. He completes his homework in a timely manner with little assitance, last year it took an hour plus to do 20 mins of HW. It truely has changed our son's life and improved our family. Get your child tested for learning disabilities and ADHD/ADD if you have any concerns. My son didn't fit the mold of what ADHD/ADD looks like but upon testing he presented with Behavorial and Cognitive impulsivity, with a reading disability. Just starting 3rd it was critical to figure out the best way to help him reach his full potential and be happy.
We do now give him 7mg of melatonin to help him fall asleep 15 mins prior to bed. He was 20 lbs over weight from implusive eating and so far has lost 6 lbs. So that was an unexpected plus for him. Overall we are very happy with Adderall and the improvment in our son.He takes it at 8 AM and it lasts until between 6-7PM, it wear off gradually."

Then i sometimes had those days where i felt kind of depressed, usually when there was nothing for me to do because on adderall  i wanted to always stay busy. other then that i lied the way it made me feel. wheni wasn't taking adderall, all i wanted to do was lay around watch tv and eat. and its the complete opposite when i'm on it. Another effect i get when i'm taking adderall is i feel the need to become a perfectionist. everything had to be just right. i mean in school when i was taking notes and they were written sloppy i would later after i'd taken all the notes i would redo them so they were neat. overall though i do like adderall

Pros: I will update this post once I find one.

Cons:

1. The orig formula was changed. These new pills have zero effect.

2. The price: over $400/month (120x20mg). Funny facts: Barr, who makes these, also makes generics and sells the same amount for $150... and the generics work (for a while).

3. Strange/disturbing fact: an insurance like Aetna does not cover Adderall (brand or gen.) if you're over 18...

To parents: do not give this stuff to your kids! Adderall is a mix of amphetamine and dextro-amphetamine, aka street name ""Speed""! It's extremely addictive and loses its effectiveness over time. It's a quick fix that will eventually ruin their lives, turning them into drug addicts.  There are many reasons why some kids don't pay attention in class, none of which can be fixed with drugs: 1- they're kids, not robots! 2- Classes are too large and out of control 3- Their teacher is boring 4-The level is either too low (not challenging enough) or too high. 5-they spend too much time on the internet, their cell phones, their ps3, and TV, all of which have been shown to reduce attention span. etc..."

I had a history of suicide attempts, depression, anxiety, violence, etc., which was attributed to a specific event  - being raped by our parish priest as a teenager at 13. The drug Adderall, made it possible for me to be focused, on task, centered and a lot more accessible to psychological treatment which lasted almost 9 years. I am a much better person for doing the treatment, I continue to take Adderall. It is the only ""psychological"" drug that I now take and was misdiagnosed for over 30 years. Work with your doctor to tweak this drug, to the just right amount - you'll be glad you did. I am just one of the many that lived through a horrid, tumultuous life in regards to the rape, upbringing, violence, etc., and just trying to find the real me. A compassionate, loving, understanding and forgiving me buried deep under the ugly layers  of hell. I wrote a letter to my doctor and expressed the aforementioned and that he could read it to any patient that he desired - if he felt it would ""connect"" with that patient. My final words would be do not be afraid to ask questions, investigate, get second opinions and never have blind allegiance to one doctor. We all make mistakes and are not perfect for we are truly, only human - it is our nature. Anyone desiring to discuss what any medications have done for me were always welcome but you cannot base your results on someone else. You can only use it as a loose guideline for your own personal situation and physical makeup. That is where your trusted physician comes in and although they may be right on the money regarding one drug that works for you beware - they do not always remember all the drugs you are taking so that is where the patient must be vigilant, especially when being referred from specialist to another doctor or specialist. I bring an up-to-date prescription printout to any new doctors as a new patient. Thank You -"

I decided to start seeing a therapist when my anger and irritability issues were having an impact on everyone around me including my children and my girlfriend and her daughter. I have always had these issues but I can also be a very fun person too. After a few visits with the therapist and asking her for help with the anger among other issues including concentration. She gave me a test for ADD and failed miserably. Went to the Dr. and he prescribed 20mg Prozac a day and 10mg of Adderall twice daily. WOW! Slap in the face and one happy son of a gun. For a week it was weird because of adjusting to the meds. Not much sleep and felt foggy and strange but that went away. After a couple of weeks I upped the Prozac to 40mg a day. Worked a lot better for me (28 year old male 215lbs).  I tried not taking the Adderall on the weekends but I just got distant and irritable. I thought it was the Prozac so I tried stopping it and just taking Adderall. Nope, that didn't work. I got easily car sick and real irritable. So just went back on both at the same time until I could talk to my Dr. about switching or something. I decided to try upping the Adderall by splitting on in half and taking 15mg in the morning and 5mg later in the day. I felt a lot better on a higher dose. I decided to save up a few extras and try to take 20mg in the morning and 20mg later in the day. WOW! That is a lot different feeling. I can really concentrate now and I actually get up and do things and finish them instead of just wanting to but can't seem to just do it. My girlfriend (now my wife) is loving it. I taught her daughter how to ride a bike, cleaned up the garage and organized it (which has been a dump for a long time) and I cleaned up my office (boss has been on my butt for a while). Best part is, I love that I am a person now. Cure for depression and anxiety: antidepressant + Adderall. Antidepressant to numb the pain and 
Adderall to get your butt up and enjoy life!"

My marriage suffered greatly, but I had a great husband for 32 years until he died.Since his death in 2005 my life was just existing for no reason. Then I found another psychist who gave me ADDERALL 20MG times a day along other meds, DR changed and added higher doses of meds. such as 300mg seraqual 300mg trazadone, klonopin 1mg 3 times a day and cymbalta 120mg, with the adderall, this has been the best combination of meds for me. I know feel like a different or normal lady. Thanks for the adderall. I reccommend adding adderall to most chronis depressed people. Don't knock it until you try it.

She had me start on Adderall,and life became much easier. I could stay on one chore and not get nearly as distracted. It has a real calming affect. I can organize my life for the first time ever. My kids see a huge difference in their mom. Seeing that I battle with bi-polar1, PTSD, major depressive disorder,and generalized anxiety disorder, Adderall I can honestly say does the most good for me! If I could say one thing that is the very most important- Never take this med more than what your Dr. prescribes! I have been taking Adderall going on 4 years and I am taking the same dose as I did when I started taking it. I wonder how many of you out there can take an adderall right before bedtime and fall asleep in a half hour or so? I try not to, but I can. Take care-

The med is very effective as far as ""follow through"" goes in life. The only drawback is the drowsiness it induces during the day and night. 

I take it in conjunction with several other prescriptions (Abilify, Pristiq, Xanxax and Klonopin to name a few. No noticable reactions to other meds. Would like the adderal ER but a 30 days supply on my rather heavy dose was recently quoted to be $780 something for 1 pill daily.

Some side effects though more so from coming off of it when I take drug holidays they are usually spent sleeping on the couch. When I take it though I do very well and usually by the end of the day sleeping is not a problem. However it used to be a problem when I took the XR version. Now I take the plain old fashion immediate release tablets 30mg at a time. Once in the morning and then in the afternoon or I break my afternoon in half to make an additional 15mg available to take closer to 4:00pm but no later that a way I can stretch it out if its a longer day. At this dosage/prescription I don't suffer from insomnia as the drug tends to wear off my quickly at the end of the day and then I can sleep. Some side effects like feeling speedy and shaky can happen but are usually mild if not somewhat pleasant anyhow. I've been taking this dosage for years and I still say there is an advantage to having ADD. One is being able to take Adderall as I can usually run circles around my co-workers. When I'm on my medicine its like my personality lights up a little more and I stay focused and on task with little negative side effects. After so many years my body is addicted to it though hence the major withdrawal I go through on the couch on drug holidays. But if you don't mind being lazy and sleepy during those time I think it is well worth it all. Adderall is 4 amphetamine salts in one tablet so its like the inventors of this drug just said to themselves ""well one of these stimulants has to hit the right spot"" and then they marketed it with the clever name ADD ERALL. So for what ever reason it does work well for ADD. The only other drug I haven't tried for ADD is Desoxyn (methamphetamine) I guess I have been afraid to even ask for it just by the stigma that goes along with the name. So my experience with these drugs is well worth mentioning if you want an honest and thorough review.   "

Just make sure your doctor monitors you very closely since it's a highly addictive drug. Its a class 2 controlled substance which means if taken improperly it can cause hearth attack, high blood, pressure, loss of bowl movement, and the completely lack of caring about the loved one around you. You become in your own 'Aderall"" world. 

I don't recommend this drug for under the age of 18 due to the abuse we see in schools, but for adults I personally thnk it's something to talk to your physician about. "

I began with 20 mgs and that worked for about three months. During this time I did not suffer from any side effects.But,I began to feel ""out of it"" again and found myself struggling to focus and being overwhelmed with all my tasks. I also (again) had problems with impulsiveness and not being able to ""think clearly"". I asked my doctor for an increase and he then prescribed 30 mgs a day. It did help. I also discovered that the generic did not work for me. I am experiencing dry mouth as a side effect. With the medication I've estimated that it has decreased my impulsivity by 85%. I believe it has taken a years time and a bit more for me to see the maximum effect of the medication. It's as though my brain needed that much time to get ""soaked"" by the Adderall XR. I am now in the place where I am now starting to deal with developing good habits to overcome my great disorganization. I am trying to strengthen my ability to think linearly.  When I first started the medication (at 20 mgs and again at 30 mgs) I found disorganization unsettling and I became neater for a time.  I then again became sloppy and I was bothered by the fact that the sloppiness didn't seem to bother me. Over all I'm happy with the medication."

My academics have greatly improved and my ability to start, continue, and complete a task are a complete change. However, like many others have said, you quickly grow a tolerance to it. I have noticed an improvement with this by taking 1-2 days off a week. Those days are of course a little rough but the only thing that has helped me from the tolerance issues. I also have sleep apnea and if I'm having a rough day it sometimes makes me feel even more fatigued. The ""crashing"" after the medication begins to fade is sometimes worse then simply not taking it at all. So far the only medication I've tried for ADHD but overall a good medication thus far, not sure If I'd say the same if used for sleep related disorders.

Anyways I was perscribed to Strattera as I entered middle school beginning with 20 mg. After seven years this medication was working miracles with a few ups and downs here and there... well that's the good part. 
The bad news is the positive effects literally ""shut off"" in a matter of two weeks this past winter. I was back to that child who could barely read a couple of pages in a book, let alone prepare for exams and papers as a college freshman. It was terrible: I lost great relationships with friends and family, suffered from depression and constant unpredictable mood swings, and the list goes on and on. Even with an increase in 80 mg the pills were useless unless two or more were consumed a day. 
I talked to my doctor about the problem and he said drastic neurochemical changes may have built a tolerance against the strattera, which is farely common with that particular drug. To compensate, he perscribed 20 mg of Adderall to take with 100 mg of Strattera a day, and let me tell you, the waters have settled and the sun shines again! Complete clarity and focus, anxiety almost nonexistent, and I feel back to my normal self. Only thing is that my appetite has diminished quite a bit and I have the libido of a neutered camel, but those don't outweigh the fact that life is GREAT again. I could see where an addiction could transpire because it's pretty much altered cocaine that's approved by the fda, but really it all comes down to you: ""can I survive w/o downing 16 pills today?"""

I noticed a difference immediately.  I no longer had panic attacks, I was able to focus more easily.  Less fender benders due to not paying attention.  I will say that after years of being on this medication I have developed a bit of a tolerance for the dosage I am currently on.  This is a medication that you can and will build up a tolerance to, and it needs to be adjusted according to individual patient history and patient need.  The dosage should be adjusted according to patient need.  Afterall, each individual patient is unique and different.  I am a bright, intelligent 38 year old woman who has ADD, NOT ADHD.  There is a difference.  This is the only medication I have found that works for me.  I can concentrate.  I am not having panic attacks anymore.  I do experience upset stomach at times.  I think the benefits outway the side effects.  If you try this medication and it does not work for you, you most likely are not truly ADD or ADHD.

I was forced to see shrink again with Interferon Treatments. Good thing too because I was fighting with the desires to kill people. While on treatment I relapsed into crack use due to the depression caused by interferon and the Antipsycotic meds I was given. My son was struggling in school and displayed many of my life long traits. He was diagnosed ADHD/ADD Opositional Difiance. They gave him Adderall. I hear bad things about ADD/ADHD meds so I previewed his meds having abused many drugs in past. At 10MG I felt like I was coming down off of crack but when the crack dealer called to deliver that I said no with $1500 in my pocket. The nerve pain I lived with daily level 7 on 1-10 was gone. Local pain down from 7 to 4. Manageble with Ibuprophen. I no longer wanted to kill people and even smiled and laughed when I should again after 30 years of not doing this. I felt normal but over medicated. I reduced my dose to 5MG from 10MG because of this so I don't feel this is at all addictive for me since I don't want more than enough to treat my symptoms where life is normal again. I now can listen to people where before they'd talk and I'd go yep, yep, yep and never understand a word winging it hoping I did not miss something important. Best of all I now realize I may have neurological damage and will be seeking a better eval after I finish Interferon treatments. This med saved someones life be it mine or yours.

I've been through a number of antidepressants and while they seem to help for a while, as I've gotten older the duration of effectiveness seems to grow less and less. I was started on 20mg of Adderall along with my Zoloft and I don't know when I have ever felt better or more clear minded. For the last several years I feel as though I was walking around in a fog. Now I can focus on what I need to get done and I don't keep asking my kids the same questions that I asked them 5 minutes ago.

I'm 20, and I was just diagnosed with ADHD (without the hyper-active) part a few months ago. I stared out on Adderall IR 10mg once daily, upped that to twice daily, and now I'm taking 20mg once daily. It has helped me beyond belief! I don't know how I lived without it! School is going great, my job is going great, I'm able to stay focused and do the things that need to be done! I'm hoping to start taking 20mg twice daily, but I think since I've just started on it, my psychiatrist just wants to make sure my body is handling it okay. I do get a headache occasionally, as well as loss of apetite and sometimes I'm not able to fall asleep quickly, but that just depends on what time I take it. I'm taking 18 hours in school, night classes, 5 nights a week, and I work during the day about 4 days a week, so I have long days. What time I take it really depends on what's on my schedule for the day. I'm new to all of this, but Adderall has been a lifesaver for me.

People said they noticed an immediate difference- my grades improved, I started paying attention, I was more obedient. Then, by the time I turned 13, I began to have chronic stomach pains, which continue to plague me to this day. At the time, I was battling ADD, depression, anxiety... you name it. The stomach issues were just another thing to add to the list. By age 15, I had an endoscopy, and it discovered I had a condition known as Eosinaphililic Esophagitis (I think that's how it's spelled) as well as an ulcer. I continued taking medicine to treat everything, until I had the idea to just stop taking my medicine altogether. That was at age 16. For more than a year and a half, I experienced NO pain whatsoever from my stomach, my depression faded, and I was still able to focus as well as I was able to on the drug. I haven't taken it since, as I haven't felt a need to, though I still take the stomach medicine as needed. Bottom line- Adderall interfered with many of the other drugs I was taking to treat other things, and kept me in a state of perpetual pain. But I was always alert and focused, so technically, the pill did its job. I don't see how everyone says this pill is addictive, I find it far from that. During the time I was taking the medicine, I continued to gain weight until I was nearly 300 pounds. Now, it's been almost 2 years since I've taken them, and the weight melted off naturally, I'm down to 175- lighter than I've been in years. I feel better, and I still can focus as well as I could on the drug, despite not taking it. All in all, I wouldn't really recommend taking this drug if you take other medicines in conjunction, but it surely gets the job done if you don't mind the agony...

Im a Senior in college.. 95% of people use it to study. If your kid says this isn't true.. they are lying.. or a freshman.. or from Idaho. I was tested and given 20mg pills... at first it was amazing. Not only could I sit down studying for my exams for 10 hours straight (literally) but it felt fun to study. Class was all of a sudden so interesting. Loooong story short, after a few months of using it off an on (about 3 pills a week) the effects changed. Yes, I could concentrate better when I was alone studying/doing school work. However, when taking adderall I felt like some kind of zombie. Like.. I couldn't smile couldn't laugh, didn't want to talk to anyone..(Im usually very extroverted). The day after taking adderall I sleep until about 2 or 3 pm. Ew! Typically I wake up at 7am and cannot sleep past 9 am! Once you start using the drug it is hard to get off it. Example: I am not physically dependent but when HUGE exams come along I mentally feel like I NEEED adderall. And yes, I use it. (Stopping after graduation in a week). The mind is a powerful thing. Once you get off the drug, once simple tasks may seem laborious. Final point:: I wish I never tried it. Also... I agree with a comment right below.. it is so sad that children are given this drug. Crazy. Try changing their diet.. brain teasers.. holistic options! Im a psychology major and we were just learning how on a basic-level naturalists perspective.. kids are not supposed to have great concentration because its a time to explore as much as they can as their highly plastic brains develop. Soak it all in! Helloooo people, what elementary kid do you see sitting still & silent focusing on their workbook 24/7? Little adderrall robot antisocial children? Oh yea.. in all of my neuroscience courses we learned the chemical properties of the drug. Very similar to speed.. and cocaine. "

It really works for me. Before, I had trouble concentrating and finishing tasks. Even minor things on my 'to-do' list (like mailing letters, making phone calls,etc.) would feel like a huge weight on my shoulders. Adderall helped with all of those issues. I take between 5mg - 10mg per day. Anymore than that would make me tense (I'm surprized that most reviewers here seem to take much more. Sometimes reviewers even call 20-30mg a 'small dose'--not for me!). I split it up--half around 9am, the other around 1pm. It's true it'll keep you awake at night if you take it too late. Other pros: I used to get very fatigued (perhaps even chronic), sleeping 9-10 hours at night, then feeling exhausted around 2pm. Adderall keeps me energized and wakeful (including w/sex life!). Other pro: besides ADD, I may have mild depression. Adderall has improved my mood. Cons: At the end of the day when the meds ware off I feel a bit socially disconnected, somewhat agitated, w/mild headaches. These are minor given the benefits.

If I didnt have my xanex for the withdrawal I probably would have killed myself.
This drug is very effective but also super sddictive. The sad thing is they give this drug to little 3 year old kids whos parents cant be real parents and want a magic solution that comes in pill form. Think about it amphetamine=adderall. Adderall is lagalized speed. How do you give a 3 or 4 year old amphetamines. Their four and supposed to be roudy and have alot of energy and stamina.Their $!!!!!
Overall I think its an excelent drug if it is prescribed properly by a doctor. It helps my depression and fatigue problems as well.Motivation, concentration, determination=dependance."

Although it has helped me focus on tasks and allowed me to complete projects without a problem it has also made me almost obsessed with whatever the task is that I am doing. For example, I wanted to clean my pantry counter, a quick spray with some cleaner and wipe it down, no big deal right. About three hours later I realized I had cleaned the counter, the stove inside and out, the dishwasher, sink, floor, and organized the cabinets. It felt as if I had to keep cleaning until everything was perfect and it just feels strange. Some may say that is a good thing but If I had video taped it I probably would of looked like a crazy person while doing it. Also, I lost a good amount of weight since taking Adderal and now I feel I am to thin. I am 5'7"" and my weight was 155lbs before the Adderal, I looked healthy. My weight went down to 132lbs and I looked sick but did manage over the last few months to get up to 145lbs. I take 50mg a day, 30mg in the am and 20mg around noon. I have tried lowering the dose but it did absolutly nothing for me and without the second dose I end up crashing and want to nap by 2pm so the seond dose is basically to keep me going till bedtime. I do have trouble sleeping and even more trouble waking up but once I take my morning pill a half hour later I am good to go. Well that is my experience with Adderal so far, oh yeah, one more thing to add. I don't know if this happens to anyone else but I notice my hands and feet feel real cold at times and even though I will be sweating I am always cold. Well take care everyone, hope everyone has a great day. :) "

Since I was also complaning about having difficulty concentrating at work, he added 10xr adderall. (i usually only take 1/2 - 2/3 of the dose tho.) It has definitely helped with my mood and with concentration. It has also made me just slightly more aggressive which so far seems to be a good thing, since I tend to hide when it would be good for me to assert myself. It gives me gas tho, and although sometimes no appetite, I haven't lost any weight! Am a little anxious and worry about it being addictive.

Have been doing so for about 6-7 yrs. Only other ADD med I've tried was Ritalin for a short time, which didn't seem as helpful.  Pros: Improved focus, concentration, motivation for boring/difficult tasks.  Cons: Insomnia, which is why I could not tolerate the extended release, and must make sure not to take the 2nd dose later than about 1pm. A small dose of Trazadone (25-50mg) has helped with the insomnia. Does take away appetite temporarily, but I make sure to force myself to eat adequately, b/c if not I am left feeling ravenous at the end of the day when it is wearing off, and have a headache and feel more moody than usual.  Need to take a 'drug holiday' at least 1 day each week, or else the med starts to feel less effective.  I do tend to 'hyperfocus' on things that I shouldn't necessarily be focusing on at that given time, but I'm not sure if this is just a symptom of ADD itself or a symptom exacerbated by the medication. Do see this as being addictive in terms of feeling the need to stay on it (though why would I NOT feel like I should stay on it, as it is helpful for my ADD).  However have not ever felt the need for a higher dose.  May increase levels of anxiety, if this is an underlying problem you already have. Has been helpful for ADD symptoms, but I've also realized it is not a magic cure, and cannot stress enough the importance of being proactive in terms of learning your individual weaknesses and trying different ways to help overcome them.  WebMD has been helpful, along with www.ADDitude.com and www.ThriveWithADD.com.  Would love to meet with a psychotherapist that specializes in ADD, but haven't been able to find such a thing.  A life coach specializing in ADD would also be great, but unfortunately is not covered by insurance and seems to be quite costly.  Overall has been helpful for me, but do believe that everyone is affected differently.  Good luck!

Although I have found that there is an interaction when I take the Adderall and Effexor together, so now I allow at least 2 hrs. after taking Adderall before taking Effexor. The great thing is I have always been able to sleep really well.  After trial and error with other ADD meds found this to be most effective.  However at 3:30-4:00 pm in the afternoon it wears off.  I don't reallty know what to do with myself, feel like I need a small dose to keep up with things I have to attend after work, errands, and in social settings. I am lucky to have a doctor who shares a real concern about the side effects in it increasing my heart rate.  She has already referred me to a cardiologist only to find that Adderall in combination with the other 2 meds raises my heart rate some.  Enough for her to put me on BP med taken everyday.  Sure there are some mild side effects of being tired but but there could be dangers in increasing the size of my heart down the road.  So the risks outweigh the mild side effects.  Just now need to bring to Dr's attention that I might need something for focus early evening.  Anybody out there who needs to take a small dosage of Adderall? Any suggestions?

Adderral is AWFUL to get off of. VERY DIFFICULT. I'm now off adderral and my pain is 90% better and I no longer have blue hands and feet. This drug can work wonders...but it has the potential to cause many health problems. "

I've never been able to focus on anything for more than 30 minutes at most, especially with work and school. It took a while to figure out what worked for me, but due to insomnia I use the instant release tablets since they wear off by the end of the day. I take 15 to 30 mg per day and it works wonderfully. I feel like I can actually function like ""normal"" people. The downside is that this is a stimulant so it will wake you up and makes sleeping difficult. It also causes a loss of appetite, which can be rather difficult to deal with. After taking a dose, it becomes nearly impossible to eat. Even forcing food down with liquids is a chore. It's as if food has no appeal or satisfying taste. Another negative side-effect of the instant release tablets is the comedown. Since this is a stimulant similar to speed/cocaine/meth, it can have an intense comedown. I become very easily agitated (little things will set me off), I get headaches, and I overall just feel sick. This is more intense if you haven't been eating throughout the day and if your taking a higher dose. Being aware of how crappy the comedown is makes it easier to deal with. I now can control my mood very well during my comedown and it now rarely affects me. I am not recommending this since it is an illegal solution (unless you have a medical prescription), but ""herbal"" use has been extremely helpful with the side-effects. Once my day is over and my comedown is beginning to make me feel sick, a little greenery goes a long way. It removes all the negative moods and headaches, restores my appetite, and helps me fall asleep. I can not believe such a helpful drug is illegal, because I would be (more) underweight and sick without it. It's what works for me and my prescribing psychiatrist is aware of my use, but I'm not here to preach about it.
Basically, Adderall side-effects can be ROUGH, but without it I could never manage to work 8 hour days or sit through night class."

I do find that close monitoring of this drug is very important. Also quiting smoking, interatctions with other medicaitions that can effect the heart is very important to discuss with the doctor. Also taking holidays from the drug is difficult with the side effects but helps to decrease tolerance and decrease having the medication dose increased.

I would have been considered a light ""on and off"" smoker; probably 3-5 per day for a few months, then I'd stop for a few months, and repeat.  

Two weeks afterward, I decided to go out a few nights and had a few cigs at the bar.  The next day when I took my Adderall, I had an immediate urge to smoke.  It was to the point that I wanted to smoke up to a whole pack in a day.

Being as it's a stimulant, it definitely helped me focus on schoolwork.  I've been on a number of psychiatric meds, most of which killed off my libido and led to sexual dysfunction.  My libido went sky high, but it destroyed my ability to perform.  I'm sure it was caused by the Adderall in addition to smoking because I checked my blood pressure about a month later and it spiked to 165/80.

I also have seasonal depression, and during this period the Adderall made me irritable.  Eventually, the depression killed off the effects of Adderall.  I just started an antidepressant, so hopefully this will correct it.

Be very careful if you have high blood pressure, smoke, or consume excessive amounts of caffeine.  If you anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder, as I do, you may have better results with the Adderall in treating ADHD."

I'm diagnosed with ADD w\o Hyperactivity. My life has been a stuggle. I lived with this disorder untreated for most of my life. this is how I found my way to meth addiction before I found out my real problem.  I want everyone to know that this medication is nothing like meth. A lot of people say that it is and a lot of people believe that it is. Let me, being someone who has experienced both. Tell you that it is not at all the same.  To be honest with you I wish that it was. Do not think that in anyway I'm trying to say that meth is a good drug in anyway. What I'm saying is, is that meth for people with ADD is a form of self medication and its addicting to us because we become normal people. I had high hopes that this medication would have some of the positive results that meth offers and none of the negative attributes of that drug.  I'm pretty sure I can tell you why this medication is addictive to people though. I've been on a lot of different medications and have learned well how to evaluate their effect on my life. This medication is the most difficult to figure out dosage and the most inconsistent medication I have ever dealt with. This medication can be addicting for us because we are tired of living our lives with ADD. When you take the medication and get varied and inconsistent results you want positive results so you take more to try to find that place where it helps you and remains effective. Its not a medication that you can just take the dosage when your supposed to and it will do what its supposed to. So far I'm not pleased with adderall. I will probably ask my doctor for something else on my next visit and pray that something else will work better for me. I know that this medication helps some people and I really wish that I was getting those kind of results. It would be nice to be able to speak with other people taking this medication and see what their experience has been like.

I have some mixed feelings about it.  I would not recomend it because of soo many mood swings, and it is very addictive.  It really helps me like the hour after i take it and after that i feel tired and disinterested and not in a real good mood.  It also made me lose my appatite in the mourning and I would have to force me to eat then later on in the afternoon I would be starved cause i hadn't ate much earlier because the pills made me not hungry.  This stuff did calm me down to some extent but I became a whole different person when I was on this and it changed my personality and that was not a good thing.  My grades in school did greatly improve on this stuff.  And it does work immediatly when I take it.  I also noticed though when I took this it made me focus but made me focus on things I shouldn't be focused on.  This makes you feel awake when you first take it then like right after lunch time you feel completly ezhausted and you can't focus on anything, plus i would get headaches every day.  This stuff did temperaily put you in a real good mood like 15 min after you take it then all the sudden you were in a bad mood.  This stuff works great for like a couple years, then after a while you feel addicted to this drug and like it consumes your life.  There are too many ups and downs with this and a different moods every hour.  And without this drug I am not a moodie guy at all.  So I would not reccomend this stuff at all.  This stuff will mess you up.  Try Ritlen I took it for a while it seemed a bit better.

Few significant things need to be said. While it did help me focus, I also ended up in the emergency room with a 194/126 BLOOD PRESSURE. Muscle twitches were rampant. Horrific negative moods with sometimes uncontrolled verbal aggression are commonplace (within myself and patients I tend to). Sleeplessness goes without saying especially with XR (extended release). I also experienced confusion and dizziness (also reported by many patients). It causes excessive urination as well which tends to deplete your potassium (which helps maintain normal heart rhythms). Eat a banana. Dehydration is a bad side effect so drink plenty of water as well. You have to ask yourself...is focus and production increase worth the risk?

This medication has made a huge difference in my ability to initiate and focus on tasks as well as retain information. 

Positive side effects so far have been weight loss, mild euphoria, and improved energy and mood. Less positive side effects include dry mouth, insomnia (I am up all night if I take this too late in the afternoon), racing pulse, and occasional nausea. It's also definitely a little addictive, more psychologically than physiologically, and on the days I don't take it I feel kind of crappy and inadequate.

All in all this medication has dramatically improved my ability to function at home, school and work and I am excited to be starting a new chapter of my life."

It has helpped me so much. i wish now that my parents would of not been so against ADHD meds. when i was a kid i had a lot of trouble in school.

I am a 26 year old make and have been feeling very down for almost a year to the point of wishing to die everyday. I have always felt it even as a child, but recently decided to seek help. The doctor prescribed me Celexa 20mg at first, I took it for a couple weeks and really didnt notice anything. He upped it to 40mg/day (Celexa) and after about a month on it I started to notice a change. It happens pretty slow, and it is subtle. But now I am much happier, I can talk to my family now without getting an attitude, and I have an overall feeling of ""life is good"". The only thing negative I noticed about it was sometimes I would feel zoned out, or staring off into space. So the doctor prescribed me Adderall 10mg twice a day. I have only been taking the adderrall for about 4 days but let me tell you... this drug can work for you or against you. The first day I got it, I didnt take it early enough and was up all night. The second day I took it in the morning, and then in the afternoon. The first time taking it the feeling was intense. One pill makes you not feel much, but after the second one you get euphoria that last's for about an hour or two and you have the feeling of being on coke or something. I was unclear for a couple of days how to use it because I didnt really feel like I could concentrate. So today I reduced it to one just before I took my test and found it to be ok. It isnt what I thought, I know it would work better if I took the second dose, but i didnt want to seem wired today, and I wanted to get a goodnight sleep. As far as mood goes, the Adderall put me in a really good mood, non aggressive, and also very relaxed (even though I felt wired and cracked out). I want to know what I should do, because 1 dose in the morning is ok, but the second one really enhances the situation, clears my head up and allows me to concentrate, but like I said the feeling for a few hour"

At the time my mother refused to put me on medication because she feared I would be put into special ed classes. I hated school, with a passion. I was bored with what I was being taught, and focusing on doing homework was impossible. After dropping out of high school, and moving to a different state, I got my GED and started college. I talked to my doctor about my problems in the past with ADHD and she started me out on Concerta, which didn't do anything at all. She then switched me to Adderall XR 20mg once a day. For me this medicine is an absolute miracle. I can't believe the difference it has made in my ability to focus, not only on school, but living life in general.

This drug definitely does not work for everyone. I have read a lot of reviews about children having negative reactions. A close friend of mine's son was taking 30mg a day at the age of 12. He also has MANY other psychological problems as well, and Adderall turned him into a monster. His rage towards everyone around him was unbelievable. When he stopped taking it his behavior improved tremendously. In my opinion I think doctors are giving kids way too high of a dosage. 

Withdrawals from Adderall is a nightmare. I've taken a few breaks from it for about a month at a time within the past few years. I slept at least 16+ hours a day for a week straight. When I wasn't sleeping I was eating. The mood swings were terrible, and I had NO patience for ANYTHING or ANYONE. But after about a week I was almost back to normal. 

Adderall sometimes makes me very compulsive.  I will occasionally obsessively pick at my skin, and once I start its really hard to stop. Not many people experience that. Also as a smoker, it makes me smoke A LOT.

I also found that Vitamin C pretty much blocks Adderall from absorbing into the body. Once I stopped drinking juices w/ vit. C, the Adderall worked normall"

I am new to all the medications. I take celexa 40mg everyday for about 2 months now. like i said i started adderall 2 days ago because the celexa is awesome for depression, but i feel spaced out. The adderall makes me feel very wired, almost a coked out feeling for the first 2 hours. then it goes away but you can still feel it. I take 10mg twice a day. I made the mistake of taking it later in the day around 4pm and was up all night. finally rested around 4am for a few hours until i got up. i havent really noticed the ability to focus more because it has been thrown off by the wired feeling. i will give it a try for a few more days, maybe cut back to just one a day. i didnt think 10mg would be strong, but it messes me up.

But to me the side effects are not worth it. Its overkill, it made me like a 'zombie'. My dose had to be raised at least yearly to even work. After being on it for over 8 years I decided to quit taking adderall because i felt it consumed my life. And the withdrawl symptoms where horrible. I was constantly tired and moody, and had a uncontrolable urge to constantly eat, i gained tons a weight. So basically I would not recommend adderall and even thought it is tough to deal with ADHD, i would recommend just overcoming it instead of medicating.

I have been on and off antidepressants since about 25 for panic attacks and depression which seems to be to  genetics. It seems I had a low lying depression for years that I never realized but soon became clear when I finally went to a doctor. I never liked meds so I was on and off of them. Nothing had really changed for me in life so i was always self diagnosing and realized(i thought) i have ADD! All the symptoms were there, told my doc who is prescription happy and gave me a script. No tests, no medical screening, just a script for 20mg 3X daily to START OFF. Giving someone that much of a hardcore narcotic who suffers from panic and depression is just beyond me. Sure it made me concentrate, big freakin deal...I always did well academically without even trying. It also made me lose all patience, had zero personality, and just withdrew from life, didn't eat or sleep and depression worsened. The toppper is that within a month I was in the emergency room for what I was certain was a heart attack. So I threw out the pills, but again I decided another shot but lower dosage. Same results pretty much. I know this drug helps countless people but if you take you better damn well make sure that you have ADD for real and not just making excuses for your failings in school, work etc. And please if you read this, and you have depression and get panic attacks don't even think about touching Adderral or any other stimulant drugs. How the FDA could approve something so dangerous and highly addictive and abused is beyond me. They should just go ahead and legalize cocaine while they are at it and tax it. Bet the nation's deficit would be gone in a year!

Didn't get in much trouble other then talking to much, or being a class clown,until after high school.Normal mornings without Meds,I could barely get out of bed,I had been angry and frustrated,with  MAJOR depression, and this is as soon as I get up!I just felt like a failure! Everything I do seems like such a task,appointments,or family gatherings have been like pulling teeth for me.Honestly getting into the Drs is a life saver. Because I couldn't have been that miserable for much longer. I know I just started taking this med.but today when my alarm clock went off,I hopped right out of bed and made breakfast for my daughter before she was even up.I normally would go back to bed once she went to school,and I have been up since.I feel happy,I even felt good last night.I am worried bc my blood pressure gets high when I am stressed out or upset, and I worry about the adderall making that worse. But I'm hoping that it will help ease my stress bc I wont be behind on everything rushing to catch up and get things done at the last min.(thats how I've been living my life) I mean even my sons shots were 6mths behind, and thats a major health concern for my child and family.My homework and health has been put off for so long.I've lived w the anxiety that I will fail at everything I do.I am ready to live a normal,meaningful life.I have always been a good Mother as far as giving my children all the love they can stand =)But now I am ready to be the Mother that can teach my children by example,a good role model,who isn't sleep all day either!I have had a couple lilheadaches,only lastin 10m,thats it.I feel brand new now!20mgs allday& last [emailÂ protected] slept good.30mgs/2today"

My only side effects were weight loss and insomnia, which eventually diminished after my dosage was correctly adjusted. While I am extremely satisfied with my experience on Adderall, I understand that each drug is different for every person  .. but I still think people should be willing to try several drugs and dosages until they find what works for them.. because effective treatment TRULY makes a difference!

Started taking 30 mgs x3/day recently and the results have been: depression disappeared, paperwork getting done, no interest in drinking and maybe 2 cigs/day. I've lost 8 lbs, today's BP was 120/86, and I'm virtually pain-free, so I asked the dr. to reduce hydrocodone prescription from 180 pills/month to 25, and I'll call if I need a refill, but I don't expect I'll need to. Sleeping less, but getting a better quality of sleep. WOW!
1529$Condition: Other$12/2/2010 1:56:25 AM$Reviewer: momof2va, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have only been taking Adderall for 2 months, but I think it has saved my life.  For the longest time I couldn't understand why I couldn't focus on one thing, or start something and never finish it without going on to something else.  I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 18 and tried just about every one out there. Nothing helped, i usually ended up feeling more depressed.  I almost felt paralized in my own body, there were so many things I wanted to do and needed to do and just couldn't.  Since taking Adderall, I am completely focused on what i need to do, i actually have the energy to do what i need to do and overall feel like a new person. I haven't had a job in over a year and I'm living with my parents currently with my two children.  In the past few weeks, I have gotten a job and started to look at apartments.  Let's just say I am making a lot of positive changes in my life and i feel like the adderall gave me the motivation i needed to do it.  hopefully everything works out, and things keep looking up!!!! i would recommend this to anyone who feels the way i used to. to me, it's a miracle drug.

IT'S AWFUL! it's pretty much a personality stripper, inside and out. When i take it I feel distant from the real world, overly focused on whatever I'm doing. I wouldn't recommend putting your kids on this, just saying. i mean, if you wanna take it that's fine, but for your unique child's interest, if they have ADHD, just love them anyway and deal with them the way they are. don't put them on meds, it'll make them feel like a zombie, WHICH IS NOT FUN. just something to consider.

It has helped with all those things.  Although, sometimes instead feeling outgoing and attentive, I feel very nervous and therefore can't concentrate on anything except how I feel.  I think this may be a result of drinking too much caffeine.  Also, during the summer, I would sweat profusely.  Even now that Fall is here, I still feel hot at times.  It's almost a double-edged sword for me.  I say that because it's working very well for me, but, at the same time, I'm worried that I'll become addicted to it.  In my case that's a legitimate fear since I used to take a lot of opiates and benzos.  I don't abuse the Adderall though.

We increased the dosage to 20mg, and I have only taken one yesterday and one today. I would like to know the best time of day to take the medication to get the best effect. I know that the suggestion says to take it upon waking in the morning. Will taking it in the morning be effective for me, because my problem is sleeping too much, but not narcolepsy.

I have taken it always with one or two antidepressants and a anti-anxiety med. It is the only medicine that has helped me be able to physically get things done. I have been and tried many medicines. Before I was on it I physicaly could not get off the couch. I have always taken the generic product non-sustained release. I hope I remember to ask my shrink next time to get me on sustained release. I had life tradgedies that made a mild depression severe. As it is a controlled substance I like what one of my counselors said ""A bad medicine for a good reason."" I gets me from non functional to close to average energy. It does not get me feeling euphoric or high. On the street its called speed. I am a recovering alcoholic of 19 years, I am taking it to help me survive, and I always take it as prescribed. I was on it from 2006 until Sept. of this year 30mg 3 times a day.

Recently in the last year I noticed radical changes in my behaviors and sypmtoms.  Not being able to focus, concentrate, lack of desire to do tasks or jumping from one to another to another and never getting anything finished.  On top of that my sleep patterns changed in a way different from my PTSD symptoms.  I began to stay up all night for no good reason and sleep most of the day.  Formally, with the PTSD I would not be able to go to sleep at night with racing thoughts about the war or I would go to sleep and wake up in sweating from horrible nightmares. Now it's like I have both going on except I seem to not have the racing thoughts about the war so much, in fact, hardly at all.  I recently started taking 20mg of Adderall XR last week but it does not last long enough and I only feel just a little bit more like doing tasks and finishing them.  It just doesn't feel like the dosage is strong enough.  I find myself drifting off to sleep in the middle of the afternoon.  I have a fulltime Psychologist and MD to monitor my situation.

Anti-depressants added to my already present symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, and inability to focus. My psychiatrist was hesitant to prescribe me Adderall due to my past history of using illegal drugs to eliviate my symptoms.I wanted to find something that could help me function without the stigma and lifestyle associated with illegal drugs. After two years with the same Dr. and close monitoring of the affects of other medications, he finally decided to try me on the Adderall. Before, I would start out to complete one task, and end up with 10 unfinished tasks and no desire to complete any of them. After the Adderall, I noticed a difference the very first day. The ability to start a single task and see it through to completion was a wonderful feeling. It has completely changed my life.

I had a sleep study and have a ""fragmented sleep pattern"" but just shy of having narcolepsy. After sleeping for 17 hrs a day for four years, falling asleep while on the computer, watching tv, dozing off while shopping and doing dishes, it's nice to wake up at 10am not 4pm. I was so depressed *because* I couldn't wake up, not because of my depression which is well treated. My psychiatrist didn't care to listen. I'm still getting the timing right so I can sleep well at night. I do take meds for anxiety, seizures, atypical depression, and tremors with muscular contortions. Thought adderal would really agitate all this but all I do is shake a little bit. I drag a lot between doses and my concentration goes away. I feel really physically hungry when I'm hungry, but every food seems repulsive to me. I force myself to eat. I've had really tight muscles, partly because of occasional contortions, partly from adderal plus scoliosis. I do a lot of stretching and see my chiro. My pulse stays at 84 bps, some very brief palpitations (one or two per day) so NO caffeine. I meditate and do breathing exercises. One very weird thing: Night sweats. Otherwise great. I'm awake all day, can concentrate (no memory due to Topomax), and can do journaling and my art again plus be social. No more haze and I'm enjoying life for the first time in years! "

He started taking Adderall @ 10mg 1x per day in the AM, 5 months ago. He is ADHD with all the hyperactivity and lack of ability to focus on any tasks, no matter how minor they may be. He was diagnosed at age 6 in the first grade. We have tried at least 8 different medications in the last four years. As he grows, the meds seem to sometime lose their effect after a certain period of time. Concerta was great for almost 2yrs and then we tried various others till we found Adderall. It worked GREAT! He stays focused and we do not have any side effects at all! Not even the loss of appetite which was always a problem with the other medications. I am very pleased with this medication, and at times this may be frustrating as a parent to go through finding what works for your child. But once you find the medication that works for your child, it definitely is worth everything to see your child succeed at all he does, especially in school. My son is a very caring, loving and happy child and have never had any problems as far as anger issues that many people might mention. He is just full of energy and cannot stay focused on one task, school assignments or just doing things in order such as fix your bed and next clean out your back pack....he may start the bed but will soon be jumping in the living room having not completed his bed or much less totally forgot about his back pack...

Side Effects: weight loss (40 pounds since March, but I was overweight), loss of appetite (which gives me a headache, so I have to remind myself to eat), loss of thrist, nausea (at least 2-3x a week, between 2-5 hours), headache, aggitation (only slightly), trouble breathing (rarely, it feels like I'm not breathing in enough air, but my dr gave me an allergy med that helps most the time). I have a lot of side effects, but honestly, the fact that I can concentrate and get stuff done outweighs them.

I was finally diagnosed with ADHD (primarily inattentive) at age 23. I've been prescribed the other meds, but for the past 10 years I've been on the same dose of Adderall (20mg t.i.d.) and nothing works better. With Adderall I am able to focus, think before acting, I'm much less anxious and my temper is curbed. All of which give me much more confidence in the things I do. Hell, it even helps me sleep better!
Prior to diagnosis w/ADHD, I had a brief stint of drug use (and I know that's a contraindication), but in all honesty, Adderall was of great help in stopping those behaviours. It's amazing what can happen when a person gains cognitive clarity & patience to assist in positive decision-making.
Although it can increase anxiety in some and if you have cardiovascular issues - forget it, I highly recommend at least a trial of this medication if you have ADD/ADHD. It continues to do wonders for me. :)"

Years after that, I had a tingling sensation that was so similar to my earlier TIA, that I thought it was an aura signaling another onset of a TIA or worse yet, a full blown stroke. So I made a ""beeline"" to the ER & the ER Dr.'s had no idea what it was. So, they got on the phone with what I'm calling a ""lifesaver"" as he (Dr. Alan S. Zacharias, a ""guru"" of a neurologist here in Boulder, CO), knew, once they told him all the Rx's I was taking, e.g., Adderal, what was going on, i.e., that the Adderall was the problem, told the ER Dr.'s that info & had them tell me to stop taking the Rx Adderall immediately. I did & the tinglings went away forever. That is ONE STRONG Rx!!! Now, I'm taking generic Ritalin & no side effects, i.e., tinglings. So, now on to this wonderful WEBMD website. It's here where I found that those who've had a stroke, or in my case, a TIA, should NOT be taking Adderal -- therefore, thank you for being so inclusive, exhaustive, comprehensive, etc unlike the PDR where no mention was made of that contraindication.

I was just recently diganosed with ADD but I know i have had it all my life. Inability to concentrate like studying, listening and hearing what people had to say, I always heard them but never understood them because I just wanted the end resuly because I am always on the go go go. I just started taking Adderall XR 10mg i believe because  I need it for school and would like it for work(I do a lot of computer work and make careles mistakes even though I know better). The very first day I expierenced like a high of energy  but very attentive that lasted only 4 hrs, supposed to last like 8. So I took it again the next day because I know my body wasnt used to it, I was expecting it do the same but did not happen, I just became more alert and focused and relized mistakes when I made them and was better able to multi task(at work sometimes i have to do like 5 things really quick)I was able to priortise, but it still only lasted 4 hours, I started getting sleepy, and felt ""like a blonde"" as usual. So I will be trying Vyvanes later so I hope it works longer because my day starts at 9 and it doesnt end untill 11pm most days."

It also elevated my mood. I felt happy that I was managing work and school well. I never abused the dosage and took it on a daily basis with the approval of my doctor for a year and a half until I suffered from a ruptured brain aneurysm. I never had high blood pressure and my EKG was fine before starting the medication. I did notice that my BP had gone up while on the medication but I just attributed that to the extra demands of grad school and a new teaching position. I was one of the Extremely lucky ones to survive the ruptured aneurysm w/o complications. My neurosurgeon said that the rupture could have been brought on by the use of this drug and demanded I immediately stop using it. Because of this I would not recommend it's use by anyone. I'm a teacher and would rather see kids or adults bouncing off the walls or daydreaming away then lying in a coffin.

My ability to focus now is incredible. I rip through tasks with ferocity like nothing I've experienced before. I'm however, admittedly, struggling with mood swings from a euphoria feeling to a ""crash"" feeling.  The drug gives me a speed-like euphoria that you will have to learn to channel into whatever productive task you need to accomplish. 

There is a huge potential for abuse here so be careful.  I've also experienced a some issue with hyper sexuality from this drug.

It will absolutely help you focus, but this drug should be respected at all times due to the abuse/ addiction potential."

I am 26 years old and have taken adderall since i was 13.  So pretty much everything that most of the things people are saying they are going through in these reviews, they have already come and gone with me.  But the last is the hair loss with me.  Right now Im going to a dermatologist just to figure out my massive hair loss problem.  I fear I will almost be bald by the end of the year (but mostly because my last dermy was a moron and never even ran tests). My suggestion is get her to a Dr.  Get a blood test or test the scalp tissues.  Thyriod/depression/stress/hormones are easily grouped and can be disguised.  And with this disorder is hard to figure if its just you or could actually be an underlining problem.  I have my other dermys apt tomorrow.  Ill respond when i have a better problem with whats going on with me because i can almost guarantee it might be the same thing.

Three months ago I was initially prescribed 15mg of the XR. I have a more inattentive form of AD/HD and I immediately noticed a difference in my ability to focus and concentrate, especially in school. However, as others have complained I notice it does seem to wear off a bit. It's possible I need a higher dosage for more effectiveness but I noticed I have begun jaw clenching and my dry mouth is insane! Although it's possible the dry mouth is from my Depakote. I have a Mixed Bipolar co-morbid AD/HD diagnosis. This medication is overall quite effective and can make a life changing improvement for some. However I want to caution this medication shouldn't make a person with true  AD/HD feel ""tweaked out"", sped up, or high. It should just elevate awareness, focus, and an overall attention to detail. That's why I agree that it is safe for kids truly suffering from this diagnosis should take a stimulant medication such as Adderall. You will notice immediately if these medications will be a right fit for you.   "

Do me a favor and eat a couple of his pills, this is not a drug for 7 year olds please trust me. My parents did the same thing to me. Most ADD/ADHD med will make him worse, These pills drain happiness. Keep it up and your on your way to a very difficult acedemic career. People that have ADD/ADHD have an intelectual advantage, i beleive most people that say they have some type of attention disorder are full of it. If you want your son to be sucessful, push him in the direction of his passion, not yours. I was pushed in directions against my will most of my childhood. I dropped out of highschool got in trouble with the law, the whole shabang. I now attend the 3rd top business school in the country. Your Son will learn how you efficiently use his skill, changing his brain chemistry with amphetimines is crazy. I cannot imagine what is brain is thinking when he is on this drug. Do some research please. And trust me your son will be more sucessful then you can imagine. I know he is a hand full as i was as a child. But dont give up and let him be crazy he's 7."

I can relate to the person who said someone can talk to you for 10 minutes and you don't remember a thing they daid. I too use adderall for it's intended porpuse. Unfortunantly, I also use it and have abused it a lot.I moved 2,500 miles about 12 years ago just to get away from what was the meth Capital of our great country San Diego at that time. Thank God meth is not a major problem in Western Pa.However, adderall and meth are soooooo much alike. I encourage anyone out there to really think twice before putting your child on adderall. First I would get a second apinion from a Dr. who knows about addiction.2nd I would look at the families addiction history. If you must put your child on adderall I would only do so as a last option where you have tried everything else. I do not mean other drugs I mean like counseling, tuitering, sitting down with your child and helping him or her with homework. I mean really try to find out why they are having trouble focusing and try to solve the problem without a drug. Doctors are just so to quick to give you a drug or to put a lable on you. I can talk to 9 out of 10 head Dr.'s and in 15 minutes I can have them lable me anything I want them to and that is sad.I honestly believe most of life's problems are in a persons heart not our head.Please talk to your pastor as well. I think that is the first place I would start. Im talking to the man in the mirrior more than anyone and I pray someone out there knows exactly what Im saying and it's time for this great country to get back to place where we can get our hearts right with God and repent for all our sin and I truly believe our world would be a better place. If anyone out there is addicted to adderall you can get help at a place called the rolloff homes. please go to pbc-roloffhomes.org you and /or your child can get real help. no ins.needed.no money, u wont b turned away

I was able to concentrate, focus, much less impulsive.
Unfortunately I build up a very quick tollerance to medications. I am on the maximum dosage (after being on it just 1 year) and it is almost like not taking it at all.
I also am having the problem previous reviewers have stated with teeth grinding. I have tried mouth guards, I destroy those in no time. I have always been a teeth clencher, but now I exessively grind my teeth when the meds are wearing off for the day.

I've been on about 10 different antidepressants since then. I am now 53. I am doing so well on this since it was prescribed to me by my physciatrist a year ago. I take 30mg. twice a day. I now clean my house, organize my life and activities plus joined the gym. I've lost a little weight, I gained a lot on the antidepressants, and continue to slowly lose it since I've joined they gym. I've never slept much since I was diagnosed with the depression but I can now sleep a good 5 hours a night and feel rested. It does, however, make you sweat a lot. I sweat a lot anyway living in the south with the humidity, but this makes it worse. Sometimes this is a good thing. I think I need another does though. During the day after my second dose, which is late in the afternoon since I get up so early, I start to wind down too early. I still go to bed late and get up by at least 5 every morning. I've always been a morning person but I think I do need an extra dose. I'll be asking my doctor for a third pill to take during the day so I can get things done in the evening. It has helped me so much I recommend it to anyone that has depression and anxiety issues like I do. I've not had a panic attack in about three months. I've found that certain situations and people trigger those. I've learned to avoid them. Hope this helps someone in need.

I am now taking 240 mg a day..thats 2 30's 4 x a day.  I almost think that dosage is to high.., but when I try to cut back, it is impossible for me to do.  I'd rather take none at all (which that I cn dio easily) than just take say half the prescribed amount.  But my old habbits are back and worse. I still make my lists, ect., but I go off on so many rabit trails while doing the list, the list never gets done.  It almost takes me 3x longer to accomplish anything.  For me to pack and go to the lake, it takes me s good 6 hours.  I no all this is not how it should be..but I think i am what they call Tweaking out on it.  I think I will go aff it competely then go to 30mg x 2 a day.  One more thing.  When I don't take my adderal for a few days, when I do take it I have to start off on VERY small dosage.
Thanks for all the reviews, I really showed me what I alreadty new in my heart..., plus it gave me the re3commended dosage for amount to take a day.  "

First, it IS very expensive now, even though Shire doesn't even make the pill.  Teva makes the namebrand now...  also the price is now higher, even the generic XR capsule.  Dexedrine is a better drug for ADHD, but is also easily to become immune to, and you're once again, F'd.  

Adderall's negative side effects were not noticed by me for almost a year.  I worked out every morning, went to class, and had baseball practice after school.  College, drinking, bad habits, and the effectiveness of the drug were all part of the problem.

Ritalin or anything like Concerta will probably make you more nervous, and give you a worse headache.  So far, Dexedrine has had the least side effects but comes with a negative stigma attached to its name."

I only recently started taking medications as my symptoms got worse after having children.  I tried Ritalin before switching to Adderall.  It has helped me more than anything I have ever tried to do on my own (making schedules, writing notes & reminders, not taking on too many things at once).  It just made life so much easier.  I don't have accidents at work, I focus better, I finish what I start and dont procrastinate.  I also am able to get to work on time and not be as stressed and irritable.  However, I have been on it for two years and I have had issues with not being able to take it for a few days or a week sometimes and I definitly felt that there was a dependence even after taking the correct dosage always.  I dont like the fact that Adderall is so addictive whether you abuse it or not.  I want to be put on something else so I dont have to worry about that, but i think that the outcome outweighs the risk...unless another medication can do the same job without being as addictive physically.

Prescribed generic Adderall 20mg twice daily. Usually split the dose into 10mg 2 or 3 times a day. Skipping dose completely 2 days in a row each week so as to not have to increase the dosage. Works very well for me.  Helps me to focus and accomplish what ever I may be working on. Also more sociable and more tolerant of others. Good for anger management. Spouse notices the difference and supportive of my taking it. Some initial weight loss 5 - 8 lbs but have since regained it.  Just eat at meal times and try more highly seasoned food (easy on the salt).  Also drink more liquids. Best to not take it late in the day unless you plan on being up late. I still sleep at night and usually take a nap in the afternoon. Some people complain about excessive side effects and not liking the results.  Well see your MD and maybe try something else.  As for me, ""it's just what the Doctor ordered"".  Wish I had known about this medication years ago.  It's a real help for me. My results far outweigh any side effects, which I find to be minimal."

I chew those night guards to bits. I really don't know what to do about the situation either.  My dentist just told me, ""Try to stay conscious of your teeth grinding and focus on not doing it.""

It works amazing for my ADHD, but I am grinding my teeth so bad and clenching my jaw. I was a grinder before starting the medication, but it has just made it a whole lot worse. I'm calling the DR. tomorrow about it. Maybe there is a different medication that wont make me do it as much. I've been wearing a mouth guard for years now, but I do it while i'm awake. I did it while I was awake before starting the adderall too tho. Its just making it even more. And I dont have money to go to the dentist. So I guess Ill just have to do the whole guinea pig thing untill i find something that helps with the grinding.

As far as moods go (I know its not FDA approved) I take Damiana by Nature's Answer and there Black Cohosh with no adverse reactions or side effects along with my Adderall,multivitamins and fish oil and yes my husband is very happy as well.Set aside some time for the kids even if you have to take a break from the cleaning... And forget the Xanax because that will just reduce the Adderall you are taking.Try to get the doctor to give you divided doses of the Adderall instead of one large dose-it costs more but much more effective and remember when it comes to Adderall dosages sometimes less is more... Effective....10mg BID or 15mg BID both are better then 20mg or 30mg a day.Also be sure to take them at 8am and 12pm-4 hours apart...You should be sleeping fine by night time -Ambien should never be needed and if it is your dosage needs to be decreased..."

I cut class in highschool,cheated my way through, did everything last minute, and really missed out on my education.  I started taking adderrall in college and went from a 2.6GPA to a 3.8 in one semester.  I have been on and off the 30mgXR ever since then.  After a 6month hiatus from adderall i am now taking the non XR 20mg (pill and a half a day).  I have a love/hate relationship with this medication without a doubt.  Ive only been on it for 3 months and i have built up a tolerance.  I dont want to take more than 30mg a day because its unhealthy and only going to continue to build higher;however i am simply not getting the same effects.  I used to get a rush of euphoria,where i loved everything,everyone, and had thousands of aspirations--short and long term, i could do Anything for extended periods of time--including studying physics (ugh) for 6 hours straight......now that happyfeeling lasts maybe 45 minutes and i still have to work at reading.  i dont have the motivation to paint like i used to,go to the gym, or leave my house. Honestly all i ever do anymore is organize/clean my house and study for a couple hours.  But by 7pm i am completely wiped out, listless, detatched, irritable, edgy, apathetic, social anxiety ect.  I used to drink alcohol socially,now i drink atleast a glass of wine a day to cope with the irritability. AFter reading this,one may wonder why i wouldnt get off.....its because im addicted.  i may only have 4-5 hours of productivity and studying  (i have board exams to take) a day--but thats more than id ever get done without it.  When i wake up in the morning i feel great, for about an hour, then i get so tired i almost cant make it to the adderral bottle to get my 1st dose.  i cant imagine life without it, however its depleting my social life and increasing my risk of cardiovascular problems. I dont know what to do anymore!

1752$Condition: Other$4/14/2010 6:30:17 AM$Reviewer: paintedacres, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I found out that I was ADD almost two years ago. I never figured in a million years that I was until she described my issues to a (T). I agreed to start taking this drug and in the beginning it was a shocker. I was so amazed how alert and focused I was and wished I would have had this throughout school. I did well in school due to getting beat if I didn't but I could have done a lot better and at least been able to retain the information. As an adult I have found it very hard to keep my impusliveness under control. I have issues with spending. I am not a shopaholic but I buy for other people when I know I shouldn't and I over eat very badly even when I am stuffed. I can't control it. It eats at me until I almost have a panic attack. When I buy things it is always for other people not myself. This drug has helped somewhat with that. It at least makes me think about it first. But while I am doing better with it, it still is not cured. I still struggle with the eating and the buying everyday. At first it helped with the eating quite a bit. Now after a year or so the effect has worn off and I tend to eat more than I did however not as much as it was before. My doctor says that you dont get used to the drug and need to take more. You only do if you misuse it. Well I have not misused and I can tell you it doesn't work like it did and I find myself needing to take 3 to 4 10mg pills (fast acting) when before and even now my script says to take 2. I am scared to go off the med since it is helping in my job and keeping me on track but I am scared to keep on with it and get to where I am abusing. I don't think I ever will however I am getting used to it. I am also scared to take other meds for add since a few times I have changed scripts for depression and it has messed me up.

I have tried the adderall XR and didnt like it as good. It didnt hold me thru out the day and my doctor had to prescribe me the regular adderall to take after 5p. Soo I just told him I would go ahead and take regular adderall three times a day. What made me change is I didnt like have to take it constantly through out the day. I also didnt like the way it makes me feel when its getting out my system,real sluggish. I know when I get to feeling like that to take another one up to three a day.

My wife is glad it has been prescribed for me and is able to notice the change. Will start and complete projects. Even have learned to play Bridge, try that without being able to concentrate and focus. Prior to prescription I would procrastenate and/or not complete projects without a struggle. Retired early due to feeling overwhelmed by employment responsibilities.  Although most would say I have been a modest success, I always found it difficult to work, most routine daily activeties and just getting along.  Wish this medication had been prescribed for me many years sooner. My prescription: 20mg twice daily. I usually only take 10mg twice daily (sometimes full dosage if I have to be up late in a social setting - weddings, going out with friends, etc.) and I try to skip dose for two days in a row each week. This seems to allow the medication to work better when I take it and may prevent having to increase future dosages. Side effects minimal for me.  I still eat but sometimes not as much - no great weight loss, about 5-8 pounds. Will go to sleep but may wake up during the night but am also able to get up and get moving in the morning.  I am still able to take a short snooze in the afternoon, which I like to do. A great medication for me but I see others have not always had the same success. My suggestion, try a smaller dose a couple of times a day and take a break from it once in a while. Ask your MD.  Good Luck.  PS:  I had been prescribed Paxil for about 10 years. This was only moderately successful for me and I was glad when I stopped it, which did have a couple of withdrawl symptoms for me. Never would consider it again.  Should have tried Adderall from the start.

Slowly titrated, a gradual marked improvement in every catagory-and some not mentioned above. Within < 1 Yr. truly remarkable effectivness beyond expectation. Even after seven Yrs. improvement continues-and personnally, for me at least, the increments of highly complex retention is-even many fold. Today- myself, unrelenting. Well tolerated, Adderall increased the cumulative component of technical and organizational skills. NO boundries in relation to unrestricted FURTHUR clinical cognitive retentive upswing-NO decline-only MORE and better results to report to this day. The titration of tailored tid dosing most amenable to tapering, titration as needed PRN. Occational drug holidays not reflective of lost productivity or ANY inclination to increase the dose on my own initiative. Not 'habit-forming' if taken as a regimen of maintanance properly taken as directed. Note: most psychiatrists/neurologists wish the Pt's would adhere to the Dr's dosage in respect to adherance of completion of the total daily amount. Most report underuse as the only negative regimen adherance (via Adderall Pt.) by dispensing practictioner.

It seemed like the effect wore off quickly, and I was often jittery sometimes to the point of feeling like I was having a heart attack.  Also, ADDers often have a problem with forgetfulness.  About 50% of the time I either forgot to take my afternoon dose, or when I did remember, I found that I had forgotten to bring my medication with me. About year and a half ago I switched to Adderall RX Oral.  What a difference! That drug has greatly improved the quality of my life. Sometimes I forget I even have ADD. Recently my prescription drug plan changed its rules so that they will cover the regular Adderall for $10, but instead of charging $10 as they had before now charge $265 for the RX.  RX is great. All I can say about the regular Adderall is that is better than nothing, but not by much. Please note that both drugs are generic."

He was on Ritalin for a couple of months 2 yrs ago & stopped since we did not see any improvement. we were at the point of desperation & had enough frustrations & so did he!Therefore eventhough I was very much against drugs we decided that he needs help so let's give it another try! His dr. prescribed Adderall 10mg/day in the AM before breakfast- a miracle has been brought upon my son & our family!! it works wonderful, amazing! the only side affects that I noticed are the loss of appetite (which I am not too upset over since he is about 6 lbs. overweight & noticed that he is hungry in AM, so I give him a healthy breakfast) and sensitivity (he easily cries if someone gets him upset).Other than that there have been no other side affects. we are all extremely happy to see him do extremely well at school. He was never hyper, but had some behavior problems - even that has changed for the better.  He interacts & socialized better w/friends. Prior to this med his grades were Cs and Ds; ever since he started on Adderall the test results are amazing; A's in social studies and B+ in math!!  Not only that it makes everyone happy (his family as well as teachers)that he's doing so well but he is very well aware of it & I can see the happiness that he did not have before when he comes home with good grades & ease at learning!! He has built confidence & holds his head up high!! Thank you Dr. Weidner!!!...& of course Adderall!  I shall return & review this med in a couple of month & let everyone know if he's still doing just as well and/or if the side affects have changed!

I took Ritalin as a kid and developed some nervous ticks. So, I dropped it, and tried to manage without. I did fine until college reading emerged.

I have a ridiculously high dosage, but it works great for me, other than nasty looks that I get from Pharmacists thinking that I am a dealer.(that buys inventory with insurance...LOL) My dosage is steady now, but for about the first year, it was increased each month. Thatâs probably just me though, my body doesnât respond well to medicine.

Reading comprehension has always been my biggest hurdle, non-technical reading is virtually impossible for me. Just below reading is hanging-in with poor lecturers. I need to have genuine interest in something or my mind will promptly begin to wander. If a teacher shows the end goal and it appears interesting, then the uninteresting stepping stones become interesting, because they are required to get to the concept that you want to know. Conversely, if a teacher presents each building block as something to know, ""because I said so,"" then I will be staring out the window before they finish their sentence.

Since arriving at the correct dosage, I can now do anything that I want. Not only are my problem areas fixed, but other aspects have improved as well. The best way that I can describe it is having a librarian roaming around in your brain. My capacity for learning has gone off the charts, my memory retention and recollection is ridiculous, and the boost of energy really shines though in self-motivation. And, above all, I now spend at least 2-4 hours per day reading anything that I want.

To put my improvement in context, I took my ACTâs un-medicated. My best score was a 29/36.
Hmm, itâs okay, but look at the pieces:
Math: 36/36
Science Reasoning: 35/36
English: 32/36
Reading: 14/36

I noticed the benefits most, when I lost them with my insurance for a month. Not withdraw symptoms, having to deal with my old flawed brain. I was spoiled.

I've been able to eat and sleep pretty much the same on this drug although my appetite has decrease somewhat and I've lost weight due to being able to focus more on the healthy things to eat as opposed to not eating at all. Excercise is much more easier to stick with and finish.

I have had GREAT difficulty with severe fatigue and ADD for years, and could not seem to work my way out of it. I tried to put systems into place, but I was never able to keep them going so they could work for ANY amount of time.   NOW I can FINALLY complete tasks in a timely fashion, organize and order my work and life and enjoy relationships, both personal and professional, as well as attend to details.  I am also able to resist the urge to hoard.  My life was chaotic with crap everywhere, piles and junk all over the place and disorganized messes abounding and overtaking me and my family.  The ability to function with a clear head and focus has completely changed ALL of that.  Thank the LORD I had a clinician who properly identified and prescriptively managed my SERIOUS problem of ADD with 10 mg of Adderall, twice a day.  I have been stable for over two years now.  The change is dramatic. Definitely life changing.

Before being started on adderall, I found it difficult if not impossible to stay focused on most tasks, especially if the task was not something that i was interested in doing. With the medication however, I find it much easier to keep my mind on topic, allowing me to utilize my time and energy with much more efficiency and efficacy. My biggest complaint with adderall has been its effect on sleep. However, I found that if I take my last dose at least 9 hours before I intend to sleep it causes little to no problem.

I have just started this medication. I have already experienced nausea, it was bad this morning and I couldn't even eat and didn't even feel like I could swallow. I almost vomitted and the feeling was awful. I had eaten about 6 hours earlier and hadn't had any of the drug in about 12 hours. I've had headaches and the jitters. They say this will pass. I'm trying to keep hydrated and take my vitamins. I'm only on the 5mg dose and have to bump up to the 10mg dose after 15 days, and I'm worried about further side effects. I know there are ADD drugs that are non-narcotic and plan to ask my psychiatrist about that option. On a good note it has begun to control my irritability and my impulsiveness (I'm known to intetrrupt and not be able to wait my turn to speak or not filter my thoughts and just blurt out thoughts) I do not have ADHD, I believe I have simple ADD and it runs in the family. Luckily my daughter doesn't seem to have many symptoms and does well in school. I just hope that the increase in dose does not give me too many side effects and I am worried that my tabacco use may increase my chance of a cardiac event. I do not like the feeling of my heart racing. I'm also taking an SSRI and worried about those side effects, my MD is aware. I'm just worried in general.

At first, it would make him drowsey in the morning, he'd take a nap, then seemed less defiant for awhile, then he would crash and come down and have like these meltdowns late afternoon.  Today, however, was another story.  Doesn't make him tired anymore, instead it was like hearing and watching a robot:  over and over repeating things like, ""You hate me.....you hate me....you hate me...you don't like me...you don't like me...you want to throw me in the dumpster...""  Over and over for like an hour.  We see his doctor tomorrow, but I'm not giving him this stupid pill, I'm not about to go thru that again!  That was awful!  It was not my child, it was like someone else crawled inside him and was saying these awful things.  Then I made him take a nap, and he was back to himself.  Very sweet and apologizing like crazy, and playing with Thomas trains.  He's good in school regardless whether he's on meds or not.  This is our first experience with meds.  But home is like being in prison, he's a completely different child (without the meds, too).  I've been reading on others, and I""m confused.  I'm afraid to give him something else, what if the behavior's worse?  I'm worried about having some serious aggressive behavior with time. Then I suffer depression and anxiety on top of all this.  We're both in therapy, but toy therapy is not the answer!  I don't know what to expect, I'm afraif for my child."

Before Adderall I struggled with moments of genius followed by days of a mixture of procrastination and chaos. With Adderall my focusing abilities are quite amazing. I have to actually be careful to not over-focus. I can honestly get so hooked on the details of a particular work project that I find myself working for 12+ hours without much of a break. So with that said I should probably urge everyone to try to maintain a life of balance. I've always been good at what I do, but now I can do more with less. I eat less. I sleep less. I waste time less. I make mistakes less. I'm more patient. I'm overall much happier. Am I addicted to it? Yes. When I don't take it I'm an even bigger disaster than before. If I don't take it I could stay in bed all day and stare at the TV. For me, the Adderall PROS outweight the CONS. If you are a distracted mess with piles of papers, a racing mind, and an inability to put first things first then I suggest you talk with your doctor about trying a low dose for starters. I've been taking Adderall for about 4 years and I take 40 mg daily, in the form of two (2) 20mg tablets. I do not like the XR (extended release) formulation of any medication, so it is not specific to Adderall.

After trying so many of the 'popular' drugs, my psych. decided that we should try Adderall -I was a little unnerved about the drug after reading all of the negative things about it online but decided that, as a last resort, I'd give it a try.
I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER! This month is my 15th on the drug, and I've only noticed minor, appetite related side effects. [Perhaps it's because I am on a lower dose (20mg every morning and one 10mg at noon)?] Over all, I've noticed my focus is so much better, along with my ability to finish the things I start. My mind isn't going, going, going all the time, and I was finally able to get a job, and go back to school!  
I understand the concern with younger children taking this medication, however, everyone reacts differently to different things, and if there were any natural alternative that would work, I'd be the first one on it. [I had tried going off of it and went right back to not being able to sit still for more than 15mins.] From my experience with Adderall, I've realised that sometimes, some perscriptions are necessary to lead a normal, quiet life.
I know that the results aren't the same for everyone on it, but I did want to share a positive outcome :D"

I am currently on 25mg of Adderall, 1 pill daily in AM.  The 10mg & 20mg did nothing for me in terms of concentration but I am noticing better results with the 25mg, though I think it needs to be upped.  Only one time I was up 32 straight hours but that was partially due to having to be in school that night as well as the first increase from 20mg - 25mg. I had problems sleeping before taking this drug and I still do, though I CAN sleep through the night. I have experienced weight loss and lack of appetite with sometimes being repulsed by food.  I crave more water now.  This hasn't been a problem since I am obese, and I have lost almost 20 lbs in 3 months.  I no longer crave a lot of junk foods and eat more healthy since snacking isn't as frequent.  My job tasks and school work have greatly improved!  I wish my mom wouldn't have just told me to apply myself better in school and actually had me evaluated.  I don't feel like a failure anymore with this new outlook and I am finally at peace knowing about this ""disability"".  "

This drug is insanely addictive and thats what I hate about it. Sure it works, makes you focus, you can go without sleep easier then others, it makes you lose weight (i myself lost 55 pounds), and it makes you more sociable with others. But the price you pay is that you become dependent on it. Why would you want a drug to do all the work for you? It's going to cause health problems, most likely cardiac, if not now, in the future. You'll have to stay on it forever (my doctor literally said that i would have to take it forever, im not kidding), and if you find it in yourself to quit, you'll hate the world when you go off of it. i tried to quit 4 years ago, got off of it for a year, and i couldn't take it, i had to get back on it. In my eyes, people do cocaine or meth for reasons similar to adderall. They need to stay up and get things done, feel happy, and they are addicted. Don't get on it. Learn to focus the old fashioned way. Because you'll still get that diploma, or certification, or acheive happiness and at the end of it all, you wont feel like you cheated or owe it all to adderall, you'll just be proud of yourself and have no dependencies. Thats soo much better and I really wish my parents would have just given me that option. Oh and one more thing, females have to get off of it when you get pregnant and thats scary to go through withdrawls and then go and be pregnant. I just had an early miscarriage... dont know that it has to do with this drug, but i dont know that it doesn't..

I hve not experienced the physiologic side effects, but i do notice i am not eating as much, but probably because I am not as bored so often.  I do believe that it has helped me quit smoking.   Immediately after begining this medication, I went from smoking almost a pack a day to two, just purely out of habit.  It keeps me so focused, I am not looking for any chance I can get to take a break.   The only undesirabe effect I have had is trouble sleeping.   I went from sleeping 10 hours a night to about 4 in a matter of two weeks.  This really has been a miracle drug, and I wish I would have been prescribed this when I was in high school and college.

My experience is the time release(XR) is the best form the non time release feels like you are on a roller coaster.  The time release is very smooth.  Although I started on 20mg I believe after 5 years on this and now down to 5mg a day this is a very hard drug on my body as a women.  I have two best friends on it and although we love the weight it keeps off and how organized we think we are on it we all believe there is a dark side to this drug that no one talks about. Everyone seems OK in our lives except our husbands.  There is an edgy/anger piece that goes along with this drug..  I think it effects our hormones in some way.  My suggestion is start on a lower dose and move up but I am looking for more natural choices because I think this drug makes life go by very quickly.  I also think as a women you can not help but get addicted to the way you burn more calories and it automaticly suppresses your appetite.  If you are on this and are having relationship problems then you might want to look at this drug as a reason and not other outside things. Also I think if you take the wrong dose it can actually make it harder to complete some things. This drug is in the same family as Meth amphedemines.  If you take this drug you should really think about the similarities to being a junkie!! I stopped taking it for 6 months and gained 30 pounds and I started sleeping a lot and my house became a disaster.  There is probably something better out there, but I have not found it.

Unfortunately, I became HIGHLY ADDICTED to this medication. I am 21 and a university student and have been on adderall since i was 19. In just two years i developed a 100mg+ habit per day, ended up literally going crazy, cutting, attempting suicide, committed to a psychiatric hospital, and then drug and alcohol rehab. Since I kicked adderall, I have been just fine. Kids won't tell you anything is wrong, because it makes them feel so good they want it more. It severely disrupts eating habits (I lost 35lbs, and as a 5'2"" female, that's a lot), sleeping habits, and overall mood. I also found a sharp decline in imagination and overall creativity. Irritability, dehydration, diarrhea, malnutrition, anemia, and withdrawals were part of my adderall use that was prescribed by a psychiatrist for ADHD. 
PLEASE, if you are a parent wondering if your kid should be on adderall (which is an amphetamine salt, which is the single purest form of SPEED), think again. Is it worth it in the long run? It is SPEED that you're messing with here- incredibly serious drug. There are many many more behavioral modifications that can be taught that are much more effective, and MUCH MUCH less detrimental to overall mental and physical health.

I did not get it officially diagnosed until I was 50 years old.  I knew the stigma of Narcolepsy would interfere with job searching. I am now on a base prescription of adderall and adderall XR combination at 160mg per day. At times the ranges may go as far up to 240mg or down to only several.  All is depended on the dayâs requirements.  I also try to take 1-2 days of Adderall free days to lessen the problem of drug tolerance.  The adderall still at the high dose performs very poorly in managing my microsleeps. I am also on Xyrem treatments for the last 5 months.  Xyrem is not working very well.  I have been diagnosed as a right clinical context narcolepsy.  I unfortunately am one of the exceptions to the effectiveness of amphetamines and the like. Even from the beginning, the amphetamines have had little effect on my body. History:  I was never a drug user and I never liked to drink alcohol. I still don't drink or use recreational drugs.  Never had any of the 'so called side effects' that amphetamines can give someone at the higher dose. In the past I have had provigil and ritlan with no effective treatment. If the above appears to be disassociated, I had more than several microsleep episodes trying to get this written.

The high from those two drugs combined is a whole new ball game. First of all Docs know nothing but to see you on your appointment and then get rid of you. If they payed any attention they would know that a person with a history of drug or alcohol abuse should not take adderall or adderall xr. But then again they keep us coming back for business. So, would that make them a legal drug dealer. Yes, it would. I had a chemical dependency to perscription painkillers. I realized something was really bad when I was taking them just to be able to function from day to day. I sought help because things were all jacked up. If I could make a difference in someone's life just by writing this little piece then all the pain I caused myself and everyone around me, then I would have to say it was worth it. If you have a chemical dependency the first thing you do is decide weather or not you want to continue that way of life, which is extremely painful. Second, commit to yourself in getting well. You will need a really good support system to help you through it. With hard work and dedication to yourself you will succeed. If you follow those three rules you will get through it with out a dought. If I had to go through it again I would have gone to the psychiatrist to get on suboxone so I could wing myself through it. I was on suboxone for one year exactly. If I would have just listened to my brother and not got on the suboxone I would have gotten over the emotional withdrawl after about 5 to 7 days. The physical withdrawls(tiredness,unmotivated)would eventually pass around three to four weeks. So, you could get through it in a months time verses getting on suboxone and wasting a year of your life.

I struggled all through out my 6 years of college and now at 26, moving into the ranks of working for myself and taking on several projects, I could really use some help. My buddy gave me some adderall and I probably got more work done in 2 weeks than my 6 years of college- mainly because I neither ate nor slept for days at time. I also found that I was able to pop these like skittles with frightening ease. I couldn't see taking this medication daily as I wouldn't risk my physical and psychological well-being for any amount of work or money. I believe this should be used as a last resort. One thing I have learned is to observe my work habits while on adderall vs. when I'm not and try to mimic those behaviors daily. This drug is certainly a tool for success but I feel that it shouldn't be used as a way of living.

I'm in my early 20s and began treatment for ADHD at the beginning of August. I feel that the medication has helped me immensely. My family, fiance, and coworkers have all noticed the change in my work habits and all-around behavior. I'm quieter, more focused, and less apt to ""fly off the handle"" for minor things that don't seem to make much sense to anyone else. I'm pretty satisfied overall with my results. That said, I do experience some side effects. I have had pretty significant loss of appetite as well as weight loss. But for me, its not a major issue at the moment as I was already considered somewhat overweight by my doctor when I started the medication. If I continue to lose at this rate, I suppose it could become a problem. I also experience dry mouth pretty badly. I sometimes get it so bad that my whole mouth feels ""fuzzy."" But luckily, I'm allowed to keep a drink on my desk at work :) Also, I occasionally experience headaches that I believe are related to the medication. But these aren't very often. All in all, there's some drawbacks/side effects, but the benefits far outweight them."

It helped a little but not enough to cause me to really follow a treatment track with enthusiasm...typical ADD. Anyway, I am now 46; I have had 4 different employers in that time, plenty of stress, depression, anxiety, low self esteem, etc. Three years ago, I had the double sleep study which revealed that I have narcolepsy. So now, my sleep specialist has me taking 30mg XR in the morning, and Adderall tabs of 20mg at 9am/noon/3pm for a total of 90mg/day. I have gone through highs and lows with this drug - more highs than lows. I think that the biggest drag in this whole process is that Adderall is just a daytime life support system for my exhaustion; it does enable me to focus, hustle, retain instructions, etc. But - I still have an incurable sleep disorder which never allows me to get restorative sleep. I am definitely addicted to Adderall; I get anxious when my doctor goes on vacation because he has done it in the past, without notice! Needless to say, I am changing doctors. Finally, I can relate to people that complain about the zombie effect. I have a great ability to entertain my family and friends with my humor, and sometimes it will just disappear for days. My new doctor said that he is worried about my heart; I told him that I am at peace with ""death by heart attack"". He was not amused. I wasn't trying to be funny, just pragmatic. I need my Adderall and I think it works great for the right patient. "

I got pregnant at 17 and was taken off all my meds. The doc told me that I would outgrow the ADD and probably wouldn't need to be put back on it after I had the baby. After a long 5 year struggle with the same problems I had as a child, my dr. decided to try me on straterra. I tryed it for 4 weeks as he suggested, and the only thing it did for me was drain my bank account. We tried several diffrent drugs, including the same one I took during childhood/adolesence without finding one that provided desired results. I was about to give up hope when the doctor decided to try adderall. A God send! I am now able to think clearly, something I haven't done in a while. I can concentrate, focus, and stay on task now. It helped me to be able to stay organized, and helped the constant aggrivation I suffered with. Thanks to this wonderful drug I no longer feel as if I am at war with my thoughts, I finally have some much needed relief from my mind.

My teachers have actually came up to me and asked if I  was the same person who was in their clas a week ago.  It has helped me get through fourth through sixth grade.  The only problem I have is that it made me want to do evreything at once and that really stressed me out.  I got mild depression becuase of that and I'm now taking an antidepressant AND Adderall.  It's kind of hard to remember to take both the drugs and I somtimes miss a few day on one or both of the drugs.  This drug worked on me but please find out exactly what it does to you before making a comitment to taking it.  Ask your doctor if you can start on the lowest dosage possible and graduly work your way up untill you find a dosage right for you.  Like any other medication it is a hit or miss and you should stop taking it if it worsens your condition or if you have side effects lasting longer than two weeks.  I hope my information helped!

I've tried Ritalin which made me feel nervous but after continued dosage increase did not help with focus & attention, and Wellbutrin which helped with focus & attention but had other intolerable side effects with increaded dosage.  Finally Adderall has helped with focus, fidgeting, increased attention, no problems with procrastination, I can patiently listen to others, and experience less anxiety.  I had had some loss of appetite , agitation, and stomach upset with an additional 10mg in the afternoon (so I'm back to just 10mg in the morning), but have had no loss of libido. I'm actually on the amphetamine salts, the generic, because of insurance coverage issues.  This medication has been very helpful to me.

There are those patients who do extremely well on this medication and others who were perhaps misdiagnosed or physiologically intolerant of the chemical makeup of the drug. The bottom line is: If you need it, it can work wonders. However, if you're one of those who doesn't truly suffer from ADD ADHD-Hyp, then you may gain some benefits, but you will also have more incidence of negative side-effects. My personal experience with the IR has been wonderful. Most everyone has the associated loss of appetite, and general ""fidgety"" feeling when starting treatment, but these do subside. However, they have a nasty habit of resurfacing later on in treatment. This usually accompanies an increase in dosage, but can pop up for seemingly no reason at all. The best advice I can give regarding treatment with amphet salts is: If you need it, then it can help tremendously. However, if you don't need it, you're better off with those awful energy drinks or a few cups of coffee. Hope this helps."

Our family doctor decided it would help him concentrate in college.  Immediately I noticed that a generally tender-hearted,goodnatured young man became cruel, moody and for lack of a better definition psychotic.  He started abusing alcohol, risky sexual behavior, and would lie about anything.  It was like a alien had taken over my son's body.  It has been a nightmare and I would never encourage any parent to give this drug to their children.  My son has been off of it for about 1 week and right now he is a fragile shell who has suffered with depression, vomiting, headaches etc.  My hope for his once bright future now rests on his ability to overcome an apparent addiction and not to be drawn back down that road.  This is not anything you want to put into your body.  I feel like my only son has been taken from me and I don't know if I will ever get that same bright eyed, enthusiatic young man back.

I have been a B/C student for awhile now. For the last month, I have yet receive any assignment that is less than an A. Menatlly, this drug has helped. Physically, not so much. I have noticed that I am more hyperactive. I am constantly fidgeting with my hands and my legs are shake profusely. Also, my eating habits are terrible. I was at a slim 135 pounds to begin with before I began the medication and I know for a fact that I will have lost weight the next time I see my doctor. One side effect is loss of appetite. This effect is extremly noticeable. For me, I very very rarely feel hungry. Just last week I forgot to eat ANYTHING for two straight days. Overall though, if you are careful and responsible this is an effective and easy-to-use drug. Hopefully, this helps.

I'm overall satisfied with this medication.  I noticed that my mood seems to be more even, I have a better handle on my disorder versus the other medications I've taken, and most of my other symptoms are under control.  I have noticed weight loss but my doctor told me before hand that it would happen. Being that I gained some weight after I stopped my previous medication, I didn't mind that too much.  I have also noticed more dry-mouth than my other medications so I'm drinking a lot more water through the day, but I don't mind that so much as I drink a good amount of water anyway.  One thing that I will have to say is that I keep having to 'readjust.'  My doctor, who I love, started me on an extreme low dose and is working me up to my 'stable' point which has spanned over 8 months now.  Getting to the point of 'stable' is my biggest issue since precautions have to be taken. Due to the nature of this drug, that the risk of addiction is high, my doctor and I are taking it slow.

Additionally, I have struggled for a long time in school, college especially and thought it was just lack of sleep. However, both of my brothers have ADHD and after talking to my doctor about my condition he recommended adderall 20mg.  I was jittery at first (simular to too much caffine) but now Im getting used to it.  I now do not crash everyday after work and no longer need my afternoon nap.  I also can focus on conversations and remeber things much better.  It enables me to be more productive and I can get much more stuff done than before.  It does curve my appetite too so make sure if you take this med. to eat as you did before.

I started taking adderall at the age of twelve. When i was on the drug it was very effective. It helped me concentrate in school, calmed me down from acting out, and helped prevent me from doing bad things. Although it has done good, it has also done bad. For example, i started losing weight because i never had an appetite, i became more distant with people because i was quiet all the time from focusing on things, and i also became needy of it all the time. I have been off of the pills for about a year now and I'm doing just fine. It is extremely hard to get out of the habit of needing them. It takes time to get out of the habit, but eventually it will work. Trust me.  Adderall can be very addictive and although it can benefit you, it may also destroy you in some ways. So one tip to take into consideration if you want to start taking adderall is to start off at a low dosage and work your way up until you feel it is doing its job.

I was diagnosed with ADD as a child, but I not took the medication.  I am 35 now and am a small business owner.  I was making small, little stupid mistakes that I just easily overlooked.  My Dr. started me off with 30mg twice a day. I have seen these reviews and have yet to see someone taking that much.  I had all of the the effects for about a month and then they all eventually went away.  The drug overall has improved my attention disorder and even made me more productive.  It allowed all of my energy to be creative.  I still use it today at the same dosage but I found it better for me to take 60mg in the morning and let it run its course through the day.  If you do need to take it. Remember that every ones body responds differently to medication.  I suggest to experiment the time gaps in the beginning and see what best responds to your body.  You will become addicted to it after a while, no choice in that, but just use your months supply evenly.  It has been a success and I researched this med.. I accept the cons of this medication, but for me ""someone who really needs it"" the pros weigh out the cons.  it has made me more productive with my life and for my family responsibilities. If you ""REALLY"" are not diagnosed by a physician. Please remember that you will get a reverse effect and it will be equivalent to taking cocaine.  But for those who need it it will have a reverse effect and make you more focused and in a clear state of mind, without the million things around you distracting you from your realistic goal.
Good Luck and Be Wise! Parents, Be alert of your kid on this if applicable, it is becoming a known street DRUG for abuse. Thanks!   "

1966$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$6/8/2009 10:35:36 PM$Reviewer: $3$3$1$I am junior in high school and have been taking adderall for 3 years. At first it seemed like a miracle drug. My grades went up considerably and I felt that I had gained a sense of control. I was prescribed 30mg a day including one 20mg pill of adderall xr. The side effects were harsh in the beginning and I lost a lot of weight. The next 2 years I would take it regularly still having the same side effects but very mild. In short, I could go off the pill and feel fine for any amount of time. But I began to feel a sort of dependence on the drug about a year after. The loss of appetite seemed to be a motivation for me to be thin so i started to up my dose a little bit. My grades went from a 3.3 to a 2.7 and so i figured I was immune to the drug so I started to take even more. For the past about 6 months I have regularly been taking at the least 50mg and at most 70mg a day. Sometimes I don't know why I am taking it I just do. I can honestly say in the past week I have slept in total maybe 10-15 hours some nights not sleeping at all. My heart is constantly pounding and my hands are always shaking. I hate it but i can't help it. My parents dont hide my pills or anything and dont keep track of when they get it so it makes it easy for me.I am always very moody and today I had a nutri grain bar and thats it but I dont even feel hungry. I didnt think drugs prescribed to myself could be so addictive but they are. I suggest people not to take them to begin with.

I was started on 20mg of Adderall xr, then went to 25 mg xr, and now I take 25mg xr in the morning around 6am, and then an Adderall IR, 10mg, around noon to one p.m.  I think Adderall works great, the problem I had was that even though it is an XR formulation it seemed to wear off around noonish everyday.  I was never able to get ""all day coverage"".  In February my doctor added the 10mg IR ""booster"" and it has worked great ever since.  He told me that every one's body metabolism is different and some get longer coverage than others.  This is what worked for me.  I was worried about sleep issues being on this dose, the amazing thing is I actually feel like I sleep better since being on this medication.  When I lay down to go to sleep I don't have a million and one things floating through my head like I use to.  It's like the background ""white noise"" is gone.  My thoughts are so much clearer now and I can actually get things accomplished instead of 20 things half accomplished.  It's too bad people abuse this drug, it's makes it more difficult for people who use it for legitimate medical purposes to get it.  All of my other medications I can get a 90 day supply in the mail.  With Adderall I have to go to my doctors office every month and pick up my prescription in person.  Other than that absolutely no complaints.  Good luck to all.   "

I work full time and am in graduate school.  I also train significantly (20+ hours weekly) for 10K races and triathlons.  So to put it lightly, I am a busy bee.  Adderall has allowed me to focus on one task at a time, improve my work projects, write papers, and train harder.  With regards to side effects, I do have a significantly lowered appetite and can experience issues falling asleep at night if I take a second dose after about 3:00 in the afternoon.  I also would consider going up to 15mg twice daily in the next couple months, so I feel that the drug builds a tolerance quite quickly.

I've taken adderral for a few years now and it has been a tremendous study and work aid.  Those who take it must be careful due to the outright strength of this stuff.  For about a year I would say that I was addicted to adderral.  I would take too much, too often and get more from friends when I ran out.  During this time I had extreme mood swings, anxiety, loss of sexual interest ability, etc.  Plain and simple I was not myself at all.  I lost weight and I felt as if my personality changed.  After realizing the dilema I stopped taking it for a bit and got healthy.  Now I take the recommended dosage on the prescibed schedule.  It is effective and since I am aware of the side effects I make sure that I am eating right, sleeping enough, etc.  All and all it is an effective drug however those taking it should be very mindful of the possible downside.  Finally, I do not like most children should take this drug, and none should do so in high doses.  If children cannot do anything without the aid of medication, then they will be dependant on this stuff their whole like.  I still function and get work done in a demanding job with or without adderall.

I was thinking i might take 20mg dosage mon, wed, and fri. I feel it might decrease my risk of dependancy, decrease the amount of unneeded weightloss, and make me more driven (aside from my good grades i feel that its due to my ability to learn quickly, though i never pay attention and never really try hard in school) I want to pay attention i just cant.

I noticed last week SOME of the pills were a little dark orange around the edge but not all of them. I also noticed that when I had my prescription filled just this past Sat. that the phyarmist typed on the bottle (20mg TABBRR) what is that suppost to mean. I also noticed that the medication usually takes several hours before I notice and difference as far as focusing that is. How do I know if I am recieving the right medication?

I felt like information went into my brain but went right out the other side. I would read, listen to a lecture or be in a conversation and end with no recollection of the information I was given. How was I to explain this to a doctor... I thought they would think I was crazy. I rehearsed over and over what I would say to them to make them believe there truely was a problem. How much easier it would be to go in and show them a cut, bruise or broken bone... they could fix it. How could they diagnose or fix a problem they couldn't see and I couldn't explain. I spent 7 years in and out of the doctors office. She first put me on prozac, treated me for an inter-ear infection, had me get all of my old fillings replaced, got glasses,treated me for allergies, etc. All these things were good but there was still something much more. She gave up, one day she said ""I can't help you"". Talk about a heart break and a validation that I was crazy. One day I read an ad on Straterra... explaining the symptoms of adult ADHD. I asked my doctor if there were special test for that. She said yes, as she rolled her eyes, but she would have to refer me to a shrink...here we ago again! 
The psycologist had me diagnosed in moments. No special tests were needed. The Straterra has helped for about 6 years now but there was still something more that I couldn't put my finger on. I have been going to doctors now for another 3 years to finally get one to take my extreme fatigue seriously. I took a sleep test and I have mild narcolepsy. My doctor has recently added adderall and I am finally content that what I have been silently struggling with all my life has been discovered and properly treated. I breaks my heart to pieces to think I raised my 3 children without this help. I struggled so badly just to make it through each day and hide my feelings of ""stupidness"". Now at almost 50, I feel like I have a clear mind...and a new start on life.   "

It worked wonders for me. Kept me very alert more focused. Only side effects I had was a little shakey, mild high blood pressure but only when I first took it, and higher resting pulse rate. I also had lack of appetite which I thought was a plus. And weight loss. I lost my job and couldnt continue to take my adderall. I was back to my sleepy fatigue ways it was horrible. So I was dying to go back on the adderall plus I had gained about 30 lbs!!!So I have now been back on the adderall 10 mg bid and my side effects have gotten worse. I feel the med works like it did before but my b/p is high sometimes 150/100 and my resting pulse is 90-100. I sometimes get ""pangs"" of pain in my chest like 2-3 times a day and I have shortness of breath sometimes. Like I need to take a deep breath. It is making me nervous. I think my b/p was a little high before I started adderall so not sure if its directly the adderall.I do have loss of appetite again but have not lost any weight. Which sucks!! But I have only been on adderall for about a month. So maybe I just didnt lose it yet.When I first started taking the meds last summer I did sometimes take up to 40 mg in one day.I know Im not supposed to but I would if I wanted to study or get up early the next day. My fatigue/sleepiness gets so bad sometimes I physically cant get up in the morning. And sometimes I can sleep like a whole day. So maybe thats why I lost more weight, too. Has anyone else had these side effects that I am now having? I have an app. with my primary physician this week for the high b/p. Just to make sure all is ok. Im only 30 yrs old and dont want heart probs.now!! But I like the adderall and hope I can stay on it."

After reading these reviews, I can relate. I have horrible tirade mood swings, I don't feel like I am getting more work done during the day, I focus on things that are not a priority,like ebay. I also leave the office so exhausted I feel like I have lost me. I have no energy to do anything. Errands are a big deal, working out, forget it. I feel like I have no time, because I waste a lot of it. Procrastinating. It is ruining my life. The only good thing is it keeps my hunger at bay, and my weight is at 120. I think I am taking more and more to keep awake during the day. What is so wonderful, your doc gives you this stuff, and no one tells you to watch for side effects. I wonder if I was off all these meds how I would be. I am 41 and feel like a 90 year old taking a bunch of pills each day. One to bring me up, one to bring me down, one for depression one for anxiety. I have never been one to lose patience, and I lose it all the time. I have ruined relationships because of it. I react, don't think.  I feel like I need rehab.

I am a high school teacher, an athlete and a father of a beautiful 5 year old autistic child.  As I learned about autism I saw there was a connection with ADD and I thought I had it.  Well I have always been very ant-meds but I was still very curious to try and see what meds could perhaps do for me.  My ADD symptoms have been fatigue, innattention, foggy thinking, procrastination to name a few.  For the last week I have been taking 10 mgf of Adderall twice daily.  Although I have only taken the medication for 5 days it has been really helping me tremendously.  I am calm and relaxed and I can comfortably sit still.  I have a lot more patience for my son and I feel better in general.  I think people should however be very careful with this medication and take it very carefully. For me this medication has (for the very short time I have tried it) been a huge help. "

Edema (Swelling/Fluid) in the ankles & feet is a seriouse side effect from Adderal and indicates a circulatory problem (blood flow) usually due to a heart problem. Most likely a temporary side effect but a serious one. If you stop taking the drug, symptoms should go away unless serious damage has been done or it's poss it could be related to another condition or a drug/food interaction with Adderall. Call your doctor/pharmacist. Also, Review drug info on WebMD.

I am 59 years old. Very satisfied. Sometimes I have a slight headache, which is not distracting and only very mild pain.  I seldom suffered from headaches prior to the medication. I sleep less but slept to much before. Still get (plus or minus) 8 hours. I had a heart stress test and no probems found but will have an EKG more often due to my age. On the plus side I feel much more comfortable with myself and others. No ""hopped up"" excessive euphoric feelings. Feel I am better acomplishing daily tasks along with anything unusual which may come up.  Very greatful for having it prescribed. Only recently started the Adderall and wish some MD had prescribed it for me decades ago.  I have concerns over some of the possible side effects and intend to discuss taking ""medication holidays"" with my MD. Married over 25 years and my wife is glad I started the medication, 20mg, twice daily. I do notice if I miss a dose but nothing sever and no ""craving"" for the drug. Adderrall maynot be for everyone but it sure is helping me."

I still felt like I was getting to much to quick, so I asked my doctor to precribe the regular 20mg generic which are scored so that I can break them in half and continue the meds at an even pace.  I have great focus at work, but by the time the day is finish I am so tired and washed out I have to rest.  This medication gives my brain the ability to focus perfectly however my energy level has not increased all that well. I eat less, but I've not lost weight and not that I'm looking to loose by taking this. I have notice a major problem with water retention and the swelling of my feet, ankles and hands. Almost like I am bloated.  I was wondering if anyone else was having any of these symtoms.  If you have please let me know.

I like the XR pills MUCH better than the fast acting pills, but can no longer afford them due to recently losing my job and health insurance. I used to take 25mg (XR) in the morning and that worked well, and I noticed less side effects.  Now I take 10mg of the generic amphetamine salts 2 x's a day. Since starting on the medication I have less difficulty prioritizing my day and schedule, retaining information, starting and finishing tasks, and paying attention in general. On the other hand, I have developed nervous habits I can't break like biting my lips, playing with my nails and a crazy desire to smoke, feel awkward in certain social situations (which is TOTALLY not me), feel edgy and moody at the end of most days, and sometimes have trouble making fast decisions and conveying my thoughts clearly. Over all, I feel the benefits of the drug outweigh the negative side effects (I used to be a total spaz and be asked almost daily if I was ""on crack"", which really messed with my self esteem) so I continue to take it, but I canât help but wonder if I should try something else.

My brain finally woke up, I could focus and get things done, I had energy, I would gladly do dreaded tasks, and I finally felt normal. Then after 2 or 3 months, it was not so effective. At 4 months my doctor increased the dosage from 10 MG to 15 MG twice a day. The outcome: I broke out in a rash on my stomach and sides by the end of day 1. Even after stopping Adderall for 5 days and starting back up on only 5 MG twice a day, the itching and rash would return. Will someone tell me why this reaction might occur? I do take a small amount of thyroid medication for a slightly underactive thyroid (Armour Thyro 30 MG), but I do not think that is the problem. I have also been on hormone replacement therapy for the past 5 years. I would be lost without Adderall to help with my ADHD. I have suffered from this condition for years, and for me it has only gotten worse with age. I tried Strattera about 4 years ago and it had far too many adverse side effects.  Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated...

My mind was everywhere, I had no motivation to do the work, couldn't explain why. My ADHD is.. well, I am hyperactive just to the extent that I find I am always moving something, just slightly, for instance like wiggling my toes. I'm also the daydreamish type, which isn't easy in college. Benefits of Adderall, in my case, included more energy, increased focus, increased calm, and an increased ability to express what I had to say because my thoughts weren't as scattered. I could follow the teacher easier in class, things made much more sense.. it was as if my mind was on steroids or something. Like steroids, Adderall had its side effects too, which in my case included mood changes when it wore off (I heard Adderall XR prevents that, but haven't tried), but I'm talking extreme irritability, and normally I am not like that at all.. so personality changes.. I kept to myself, felt my empathy leave, feelings and emotions numbed SIGNIFICANTLY. felt dead inside. Sure, I could concentrate on whatever I CHOSE, and I didn't magically want to do school work, that's the catch. If you're like me, you still have to make that conscious decision to do the work.. and once you do decide to, it is a heck of a lot easier to concentrate. If you start the doses do so slowly.. when I was on too high a dose, I felt so stressed, had high blood pressure, & I was angry, & too concentrated. Please consider trying other options first. I got off adderall, was tired for daysss, learned more about ADHD & more about myself.. & I don't have it all figured out but I feel alive & unaltered & like myself & EVERYONE can tell when the real me is showing.. having people who understand & love me the way I helps me want to care for myself better by eating better, sleeping earlier, exercising & relaxing more, & being alone, without distractions when I study. Be easy with yourself, DO NOT GIVE UP, you ARE NOT alone!

I simply don't understand how a doctor could start someone at a dose of 30mg at a time twice a day. That's asking for a heart attack. I've thought about switching to the time release form but I like having the ability to modify how much I'm taking at each point in the day so I'm most productive."

Then after about the 6th. grade my father said it was all in my head. So he took me off of it. Until about 6 yrs. ago I went on Adderall. It has saved mylife. I can sit and talk to someone without getting up or asking over and over what they said. I can start and finish things. Yes I eat a little less but to me I do not care. I came from a time when there was no drugs not even a name for it. The Dr.s made my mother think she was a bad mother. So yes this drug can be used for bad. If not taken the right way. But for people like me its the answer to my problems.

My grades in college improved dramatically (I am now graduated) and I am very focused, accomplishing any task hand. This works great, however, if I am tired and I take this medication I will get lightheaded and have heart palpitations. I suggest not taking this medicine in the late afternoon or evening because it WILL prevent you from getting a good nights sleep. Other then those few down points, this drug has changed my life. If taken responsibly it does more good then harm. Please watch out for what I have experienced: Dry mouth, sleeplessness, circulation changes (warm spots on hand and feet)loss of appetite. For me, the benefits out-weighed the detriments, but it will be different for everyone.

The positive: I see a huge change in my work habbits, and I'm able to get more tasks done in a shorter period of time.  My mood is actually BETTER and I feel happier.  I've lost weight (which I have always had a hard time with).
The negatives: My hands and feet are always cold, sometimes my vision gets blury, I forget to eat which has caused me to lose too much weight at times and also causes my hair to fall out sometimes, I CRAVE cigaretts (I don't even like to smoke, but I can smoke a pack every few days while on my meds), dehydration, lightheadedness, and very dry, itchy skin in my pelvic area.  Sometimes my hair folicles get infected which I haven't figured out if it's due to Adderall or not just yet, but it started about a month after I started taking the meds.
I like how well it's helped me, but I worry about the long term side effects.  "

2058$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/8/2009 6:00:46 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$3$"I started taking Adderall XR a year ago, w/o a prescription.  I am in my last year of college and up until last year, I could never pay attention in class or study.  I started taking 20mg when I had to study, and instantly my grades improved.  I now take it whenever I have class to attend or when I am studying, which is between 2-4 times a week.    I start to feel it about 30-60 mins after I take it. If I'm tired, it wakes me up completely(I am never tired during its duration). It lasts about a total of 6 hours for me (female, 110 pounds).
During these hours, I only desire to study and learn. In class, I am now very attentive and class goes by so much quicker for me.  In the past, I just daydream and can't stand sitting there for more than 1.5 hours.  Now, I can sit through a 5 hour class.  I also participate a lot in class now, it makes me want to show everyone how smart I am, haha.  However, when I am on it, I do not like people talking to me because all I want to do is study. People now always tell me how much of a nerd I am, which makes me feel really happy :)
Side effects: dry mouth, my old O.C.D. tendencies spring up, I do not eat (I lose weight during the part of the week that I take it), I smoke cigarettes (I recently quit and never desire one, but when I take adderall, I smoke a lot), I cannot sleep until 5am even if I take it at 8am.
I do notice that I build a tolerance to it whenever I take it like three days in a row.  It doesn't last as long.
Basically, during those 6 hours, all I want to do is study.  I'd imagine that if I took it on a day where I had no studying/class, I'd probably go NUTS.  I guess because I am normally focused in everything else, just not in schoolwork.
It has definitely helped me (my GPA is now 3.6, compared to 2.0 before taking it) and I do not crave it on the days that I don't take it. However, I can definitely see how detrimental the side affects of this drug can be, and I'm so glad I only have one more year of school left!"

Its not a drug that instantly makes you organized or extremely good in school, that is your part, it just gives you a boost and focus that you need, but without effort on your part things wont change that much.

I had dislexia as a child, and when I was younger, if anyone in our family had a problem, it was to be kept a secret. I finally got help, and found out I have ADHD. I have been on this medication for 3 months now, and what a complete turnaround, talk about 360! I can focus more on important things, I even noticed a change in my driving, instead of running around like a chicken with its head cut off, I have slowed down and started enjoying things, and am much better at dealing with with problems instead of running away from them, I have also been writing a journal everyday, and remembering things alot better, and feel I am thinking before I open my mouth first. the only problem I have noticed lately, is that at night, I get a little edgy. other than that I love the fact that I feel like I am finally in control of all the racing things that used to go on in my head, and now I can sit back and relax for a change, and organize my priorities, whereas before I could not.

I was off of them for about three months and all of those long gone adhd habits that had played havoc with my life started coming back one by one. Unpaid parking tickets, loosing my keys, rash decisions, unfinished project after unfinished project. Within six months I had almost lost my photography business that I had worked so hard for and had collections agencies after me etc.  Wow what a bust to my ego! I guess I really do need to be on Adderall. It's as if when I am not on Adderall I know exactly what it is I need to do to keep my life running smooth...I put together my to do list but the to do list never gets completed. Yes I am a successful advertising photographer with lots of talent...but without the discipline and focus to apply that talent my world falls apart. I guess I just need to take it...it is what it is. I know there are lots of talented artists who take adderall...and I do not feel it makes me any less creative....or for that matter any more creative. How one little adderall XR pill makes the difference between being reasonably disciplined and totally irresponsible, however, is beyond me...but for me the reality is just that. I am now back on Adderall 20 MG XR and things are going great again. Hope this was helpful to any other artists out there who are struggling with the to medicate/not to medicate question. In my case the choice was made for me...I do not even think I would still be in business without this drug..no kidding.

I recently finished graduate school, and stopped the Adderall since I stopped seeing the MD.  Now that I've been back on it (about 2 weeks) I'm much more focused, I don't drift off when I'm speaking to clients and feel more motivated to finish my work on time.  I'm also  not binging as often as I used to, which is extremely helpful since I have gained 10 pounds in the last 6 months.  I don't feel aggressive or angry to the point where its affecting my life and hurting others.  Of course, I still have to make some behavioral changes to improve my organizational skills, but that's not something any medication can fix.  Don't expect it to change everything, as part of the treatment for ADHD is to learn new tools to combat the symptoms.  This medication is not a good idea if you or any family members have a history of substance abuse or dependence, since you are predisposed to those conditions.  If you have any psychiatric issues in addition to the ADHD, you must speak with your doctor about them, since treatment will be counterproductive.  You play the greatest role in your treatment-not the medication.

This was my second round in the third grade after being held back because of lack of attention and comprehension. Throughout the years I went off and on with various ADD medications trying to find out what works best for me. I am now looking at graduating college in December and was prescribed Adderall at the beginning of this semester. I have been a stellar student this semester and have accomplished more in one semester than I have in my entire collegiate career. I echo some of the previous posts regarding the problem with jitters and increases in tobacco use. I am not a a doctor and in no way am I posing as one on this blog. However,  i would recommend if you are seeing an increase in your tobacco habits try using hard candies to suck on when you have the urge to smoke your 4th cigarette in a row, this helped me reduce my urges and aided the hand to mouth habit that is associated with many smokers. Again, this may or may not help you at all and if you are concerned you should inform for doctor immediatly.

I worry about becoming dependent on it, so I am looking for some natural alternatives so I do not have to stay on for several years.  I have read that ADD and sleep apnea are common.  So I am planning on getting sleep study to see if this may be part of the reason.

I have taken many things to keep me awake-uncluding provigil and ritalin.  Provigil helped, but I was still tired all of the time and would still fall asleep at the drop of a hat.  I have been taking adderall 20mg 2x a day for only a short time.  It has made a big difference so far.  I am always very careful with medications, so I am very nervous about the long term effects.  When I take adderall, I do not want to eat for 3-4 hours after, so I have not been eating breakfast or lunch.  My boyfriend and my mom (the closest people to me) have noticed a change in me.  I can make decisions easily (never used to be able to do this) and I am not as emotional.  It has helped me to stay awake, focus, and live like someone without sleep disorders, so for the time being-I am very happy.

My doctor moved me down to 12 mg to stop the weight lose, which it did. I did however notice that it was not working as well so I was placed back onto 15 mg. The 15 mg dosage no longer worked as well as it originally did so I was bumped up to 20 mg and than once again to 25mg and in the 8th grade I was finally bumped up to 30mg where I remain to this day in the 11th grade.

Side effects I have experienced:
Lose of Weight
Lose of Apetite
Depression
O.C.D symptoms (extermely prevelent in my last two years)
Anxiety
Paranoia
P.T.S.D
It is strange I go through a living hell almost day by day which may or may not be because of the Adderall but I can not just stop taking it because I fear being the way I am when I'm off of it during my everyday life because I get really ""crazy"" when I am not on it and eat a lot and just am moody and its pretty bad so I stay on it even though sometimes (more than less) I feel like a am losing my mind. I sometimes wonder what I would be like today if 8 years ago I had not been put on Adderall. (I actually did not have ADHD in the beginning it was ADD but it seemed to have developed into ADHD.)"

I feel confident about just being me for the first time in my life and I'm 32yrs.old. The medicine doesn't make me feel drugged up like other meds I've taken in the past. Which was due to the fact that some doctors brushed it off as conditions such as depression or just anxiety(due to being depressed). It really has fixed some major problems in my whole overall way of life. I'm very pleased that I have control back over myself again and hope it stays this way.

The jittery feeling, increased hear rate, and loss of appetite.  The jitters were the worst.  I could focus my mind but I still felt squirmy and totally ""out of it.""  Sometimes, I was TOO focused, and could only concentrate on what was going on in my head, and felt out of touch with the outside world.  As far as concentration for school goes, it was very helpful, but my doctor took me off it because he was worried about my health.  I tried the XR once, but did not like it as much because it took too long to work and was not as strong.  no other drug seems to have been as helpful.  "

I finally went into therapy just over a year ago at the urging of my wife and was diagnosed with ADHD. I started taking Adderall about 8 months ago. I have found that Adderall is very effective at helping me to focus and listen. It helps me to be more deliberate in my actions, I'm not just drifting through the day. In my classroom I have found that I am able to listen to myself better and not be distracted by those students who give me that 'I'm so bored' look. One of the most interesting effects I've found is that I now actually hear and listen to the lyrics of songs! - never did that before. Looking back at my life, all the way to when I was 6 years old I now recognize the symptoms that had always been there.  I feel that the treatment is working for me, but as my doctor says, the worst part is that I'm 48 and have only now finally taken care of a life-long problem. I take 30 mg. (15 mg standard 2 x a day). I did feel the side effects for about the first two or three days (teeth grinding and dry mouth) but they subsided and I don't have any issues with that now. I've lost a few pounds, but I love to eat and  once I start eating, my appetite is fine. I know that I'll have to continue with this, probably for the rest of my life, but I think of it as a simple compound that my body chemistry is simply missing - so it helps me a lot.
Finally I would say to those of you suffering horrible side effects, stop, and get another opinion! If the side effects are that bad, then you probably have a different problem. Amphetamines are an important drug that can work well for those who need it, but if you don't, you are abusing it. I thought that it would be like the speed we experimented with in high school, but it's not. It is an essential part of my life now, stigma or not -"

I switched over from Focalin because that drug did little to improve my ADD; it just made me irritable once it wore off. I'm on 30 mg twice a day now. The drug puts me in a good place but it doesn't seem to accomplish its actual purpose. I know I've become dependent on it even in this short period of time. Other users have noted this drug should be avoided if you have an addictive personality. I agree completely. It never occured to me that I might have ADD,I was more concerned about my depression. Anyways, my psych noted that I consume about three caffinated drinks a day along with a pack and a half of cigarettes. Now this drug is just another one of the stimulants I consume throughout the day to feel normal, or at least like what I have come to consider ""normal."" Seriously, I've met herion addicts who expressed concern when I told them I take Adderall. This drug is dangerous. Part of me thinks the companies behind it are guilty of endangering a lot of people, but when I remember how I felt just after a few days of being off it, you won't see me trying to stop them."
2118$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$9/27/2008 5:21:59 PM$Reviewer: DevinT, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$4$"In high school, my mom kept on me to do my schoolwork, which was good.  However, half way through college, I started failing classes not having support, so I went to the school counselor.

She helped me out a bit with a schedule, but still in crunch time, halfway through a Term (quarter), I just couldn't focus for homework.  She brought up ADD, so I contacted a Psychiatrist.

My psychiatrist wasn't there, so I had my initial assessment with a stand in.  She said I probably have Bipolar II (hypomanic-depressive).  Shocked, I still geared up and looked up symptoms and this and that.  Sure, so I have mild/moderate Bipolar...I thought everyone did.

I had an appointment with my real psychiatrist, and he was on the edge on if I was Bipolar or ADD.  Apparently, a lot of the symptoms overlap.  It was possible I have both, though, so I scheduled another appointment and took Lamictal for BP2.

The appointment after that was halfway through the term.  The mood swings were better, but I still couldn't focus.  I was ""driven to distraction"" as he put it.  I would procrastinate to the point where I was not confident I could get the work done, and then to cheer myself up, I would do the very thing that I used to procrastinate (like a video game).

He prescribed me this stuff, Amphetamine Salts.  I took it the day after he prescribed it...and for good reason.  I had an assignment due the next morning.  I had a meeting to prepare for and run.  I had important people to email.

It felt like I was sipping on a heavily caffeinated beverage all day.  That's when I'm most motivated.  I got all the emails sent out, I ran the meeting just fine, and I edited 8 pages of a document that I have been sitting on for over a year.

The side effects I experienced were dry mouth, muscle tension, strange busts of tiredness that go away in 10 minutes, high blood pressure (expected), feeling a little cold, easy smiling, and restlessness.

I was finally diagnosed w/ADD when I was 20.  All my life I STRUGGLED through school (constantly daydreaming, forgetting assignments, awful  comprehension). I studied so hard and still earned mostly Cs. Teachers suggested to my parents that I be tested for ADD but I refused because I thought it meant I was dumb.  When I went away to college I did not have my parents reminding me to study or do homework.  The work load and subject matter was increasingly more difficult until one semester I ended up with a 1.5 GPA.  At that point I had enough of the struggle and I made an appointment with my Doctor.  After going through testing I was diagnosed with ADD and was put on Adderall.  I suddenly started to really enjoy school and on top of it all, I really wasn't dumb.  I ended that semester with a 3.85 GPA.  I got an A in Quantitative Business Statistics and loved the class. I continued on with excellent grades and enjoying school and graduated from a State University with a Bachelor of Science.  My only regret is not starting this treatment sooner.  I think that years of struggling through school, feeling left behind, and feeling ""stupid"" has a negative impact on a child's development of self confidence, self esteem, and perseverance in life. For people that are ""on the fence"" about taking medication or allowing their child to take meds to treat truly DIAGNOSED ADD/ADHD, ask yourself this..... If(you/your child) had diabetes would you not give your(self/child) insulin?  Everyone should have all the tools they need to succeed.  I am thrilled to be succeeding in life!!"

I am also taking adderall, and know in my heart that I am addicted, and struggle with knowing this everyday.  With not wanting to refill my script, but knowing that the addict in me will call my doctor and get a refill.  Knowing that I will become emotionless and cold, sleepless and edgy, but with a clean house and unhappy children who don't understand why their mom is so tense and angry.  I know that I will start having to take Zanax and Ambien to calm down at night, and that the divide between my husband and I will grow bigger.  This medication helped me at first, it felt like legal meth.  Because that is what it is.  The sad thing is, I was working in the substance abuse field when I began by adderall journey.  I am not saying that everyone will experience what I am going through, but my sister also has the exact same problems.  While I thought we would be having cookouts and taking our kids to the park, instead we are swapping scripts and pills and cleaning tips.  I caution everyone who is thinking about taking this drug to consider whether they can do it responsibly, and their family history of addiction.  Reading these other reviews makes me feel much less alone, but also very sad that so many people are having these problems.  I realize that I may need help to get off of it, but that is very hard when you work in the field that I do and your professional reputation is on the line.  I use up my script in less than two weeks, and then have two weeks without it.  The two weeks w/out it are so much better, but the addict in me never listens.  Every month I think I can do it responsibly.  I just wonder, when is it gonna be to much?  I know the saying one is to many and a thousand is never enough.  In my case, that is so true.  Please be careful.

    I have a ""Mentally challenged"" friend who has adhd or a.d.d and he had a prescription of Adderall.Since I was a stupid young teen,I loved experimenting with pills I had no prescription to.
After the first pill I felt on top of the world.I could speak better/faster/more intelligent.I could focuse better,I had NO ANXIETY what so ever of any sort.I had REALLY bad social anxiety and fears of situations before they even happend.But with Adderal,it disapeared 110%.In fact with Adderall,I WANTED! to go out and socialize,when usually I would just hide in my room for days/weeks/months((no joke))
so finally I got my own perscription.The doctor wasnt sure about it,but I told him about all the countless benifits I was having,and he finally let me have it.
    Of course there was a downside to this to though =(  Eventually,I started to abuse it.Taking it more often than I should have.I would even chop it up and let it dissolve in water.Stay up all night & pull all nighters (which was still kinda fun,,I got to wright some of my best guitar riffs back then and clean my room spic and span)) but I got real irritable when taking tooo much.OMG and the TEETH GRINDING LOL!!!!Another thing I disliked about being on close to slightly over amount is my penis would shrink greatly lol.Though I could still ""get it up"" when needed.It looks like I came out of cold pool.
    Anyway,,,,I really miss this pill,almost 10 years have past,I'd like to give it another try but be a little more responsible this time."

Right now I take 90 milligrams a day of Adderall non-time released. I have days where I am tired, on these days I take more than perscribed. In my opinion Adderall is highly ""abusive"". When you take a medication long enough your body becomes immune and the medication isnt as effective as it was when you first started taking it.

I dont think Adderall should be prescribed to children under the age of 18. All it takes is a simple 20 question evaluation and you are prescribed a drug that may forever change your life. 

I have tried to stop taking Adderall and I have not been successful yet. I get so mad at myself when I sleep for 5 days straight (when im finally back to normal) and then go back to the Adderall.

My advice to anyone condsidering this medication is to get a second opinion. Honestly, I know I dont have ADHD or ADD, the Adderall makes me have ADHD. I didnt need this medication when I was prescribed it 3 years ago and now I cant get away from it. I have faith in God that He will get me through this and allow me to feel again. The Will of God will never take you where the grace of God cannot protect you. God bless you all!!

2151$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$7/14/2008 1:47:08 AM$Reviewer: Truth (Patient) $3$2$2$I believe I have a mix of hyperactivity and inattentivness.. I'm easily distracted, like to be on the move (as if driven by a motor), its hard to stay on task, I zone-out/daydream here & there, I find it hard to be motivated, especially in school (unless I am genuinely interested in the material & feel it really applies to my life). I procrastinate, can be quite disorganized, and stress out because of this all! Thats when I dont take Adderall.  Only somewhat effective because the tablets tend to wear off as the day progresses which results in irritability, they initially get me down to business. I'd hoped that side-effecrs wouldnt apply to be but well in reality they do. this drug really is no joke and should be taken seriously because of its habit-forming tendency. i dont like the idea of depending on a substance to do things i used to be able to do without it. true, those things were harder to do before Adderall, but: when i would go a day or 2 without it, or just be on a lower dose, i found that the fatigue that set in as a result (side-effect) made those things harder than it had been before ever taking the Adderall! Essentially Adderall had picked me & dropped me lower than before =/ I don't want to go back off of it, however i do want my genuine self back, the one that isn't so serious and annoyed. high blood pressure is another thing to look out for. this can raise it. it makes me tense at times. But if you're like me you'll like it AT FIRST. It helps me work & i mean efficiently, but I don't always need this stuff.. maybe when i have a paper due but not when just hanging with friends. i made it without Adderall but it wasnt easy & it especially isnt now that i've been on it. Learning about ADD helps me understand myself better & discover under what conditions i'm best able to work. this'll make a difference in whether I decide to continue it. I of course respect that the severity of the ADD in any case also must be addressed. Dosage is also very important.

I started taking adderall to help me with my school work about 7 months ago.  Before the medicine I procrastinated, could not finish a projects, was disinterested, and unmotivated.  When I take this medication I shed all of those characteristics. I am able to study for about 5-8 hours straight and obtain all the information. I am in my senior year of college and thought I could use a push to finish the hard classes. I became interested in learning; I grasped concepts easily, and became level headed and rational.  I will say though, there is a huge downside.  I got bad headaches, lost ten pounds, blacked out frequently for a second when I stood up, chest pains, and numbness in my hands. When on the medication, I lost my connection to emotion and was very irritable.  I tended to be cold and distant.  I know this medicine works but I did not want to put my body through the side effects any longer.

I have stopped taking this due to the person I was becoming.  It takes more discipline for me to study and stay focused but at least I feel like my true self. 
This drug is habit forming. I thought I could not get an A on a test without it, but I did and I can.  Plus now when I get an A it is more rewarding knowing it was all me who earned, not the adderall.

My experience with Adderall has been a love/hate relationship. I started on 20mg in a.m. & 10mg in p.m. It gave me more energy, made me mentally sharper & I felt normal & happier since I was more able to communicate & think clearly. I was happy.. at first. Then I noticed I could stay up WAY late. Then I'd sleep in & miss the classes I'd finally begun thoroughly doing the work for. Also, friends pointed out Id become irritable & mean at times. I agreed but was upset because of all the good adderall was doing for me otherwise. The tablets wore off later in the day, causing my moods. My prescriber recommended a higher dose, I agreed & I liked it, I was focused on getting my stuff done. STILL, I was.. cold, emotions were distant. IMPORTANT: check before you start this if theres a history of addictions to substances like alchohol etc in your family as this can really be HABIT-FORMING, as in my case. Also, Adderall doesnt allow refills. This was prob when back from out of state college & I had insurance- coverage issues, which forced me to go off adderall. DIFFICULT. I was SO tired, moreso than EVER before. felt like a moody addict & sad & like doing NOTHING.2nd day with no Adderall in my system, woke up during the night & threw up. Horrible & bizarre. BE CAREFUL, listen to your body's signs if on it. Try keeping lowest dose possible. Off adderall, I still had a job to get & chores ETC when just functioning was a task. Gained back the weight i'd lost, plus a few. After that I felt better each day, but back to my spacey, scattered & anxious self again. Caffiene helped, in big amts. Insurance is fixed, I caved & am back on it. They say you'll feel like a different person. Maybe, I feel my old Adderall self returning, more focused but mean. My family has noticed. Mom said i'm not my old self. & I fear I'm becoming dependent again. Im taking lower doses & may switch to Dexedrine or Adderall XR. Think.

It is a hardcore stimulant that is similar to an illegal group of drugs if you catch my drift. Has helped me but I'm not sure if the benefit has exceeded the cost.

I am also on Zoloft & Lamictal. I have noticed an increase in anger and rage over the last 2 years or so, and I have been researching ALL of these drugs in order to find out if all 3 are causing these highly charged emotions, or just one or two. The smallest incident can absolutely en-rage me to the point of screaming and then crying out of frustration or just plain anger. I'm wondering if anyone else has these issues with adderall, in particular. I am not even sure I could function without this drug, but I want off ALL of them and I need to taper myself off them. I know my liver is damaged from them, and I fear with the anger I have inside me, someone will get hurt or someone will hurt me. Another issue for me is that these drugs aren't manufactured in the United States, and the big Pharmaceuticals contract with China & India which aren't quality controlled. This actually makes me VERY angry, so I am going to get off these and try to be normal, and IF I still have these destructive emotions when I'm off them, then I must seek help elsewhere. Adderall in my opinion is a very dangerous drug and giving any ADD drug to a child, adolescent or adult is irresponsible and the drug companies do NOT give a hoot about people, as it is ALL about PROFIT. The FDA is just as corrupt as the big Pharma, and together they are in collusion and both have made billions on people's lives and deaths.
Research it yourself and open your eyes to the corruption in our country, including our own government in regard to the big Pharma's and the FDA. It will scare the HELL out of you!!!"

It's hard for me to obtain,but if I don't,I do bad things. I hit someone head on in my car, for ex. I think taking this drug for 10 years (since age 15 or 16 or so), has also had me turn into a raging psychopath when I'm coming off it. It only gets worse. I don't know I am acting badly, other people who know me complain. I think it's impossible to fix ADD or ADHD, because... why is it such a problem to not be able to sit still? Isn't everyone fat these days because they are far too lazy? Seems dumb to try to fix people who are hyper or not attentive. The world is a boring place. School is boring too. While this substance improved my grades during school, I found no satisfaction in my life. It numbs my feelings. It makes me more agressive and mean. But as far as helping ADD or ADHD, I don't think it does that at all anymore. My thoughts still race, I still get distracted, I am still bouncing with energy. I am on 90mg a day. Thats as high as it gets. Even though it doesn't help, I take it because I am afraid I will hurt someone else if I stop. I do not know who I am without this medication. People who take it to feel less tired are abusing it. People who give it to kids SHOULD NOT. People who take it to be less depressed are abusing it. It's not for depression. I'd reccomend exersize for that (not a doc). Besides all that, I'm tired of having to spend my time chasing after this drug every month to fill up on my prescription, because some people think it's cool to take it recreationally. THAT is the dumbest thing of all. This is the least fun drug, ever. They should adjust it so there is no more false euphoria from this drug in anyone. I never felt euphoria of any kind from it. But to give it to a kid that DOES (even legally), I could see it as being addictive. I've been medicated since I was 5, Ritilan, countless anti-depressants and then back to the desoxyn and Adderall.Yeah-I don't even talk to my parents anymore.

Believe the ritalin worked a little better & probably would be better off w/o it too. Started these type meds during period of extreme stress mainly for depression.  Now that stress is less believe I've become a little too dependant on it. I would suggest trying all other measures first & especially with children who are dependant on the parents judgment. My Doctor said he would be curious as to how much physical activity a child is getting before trying these type meds. Maybe try increasing that first. Basically proceed with caution & honesty.

I don't know what to do because nothing makes my depression go away like Adderall does. I also find it's not necessary to take it everyday. I find it best to skip every 3rd day so I can sleep. It does cause insomnia, but I had that before I ever took Adderall. This is like a miracle drug for me. Now if only I knew a doc who would give me enough to last all month.

At the time I didn't know fully how it effected me, all I knew is that it made me want to throw desks at the teachers that irritated me, and that I was unhappy and pissed of for no reason. I switched from adderall to stratera, then to ritali LA, but I prefered not taking anything because of how they effected me. In January I started back on Adderal XR @ 15mg and I told myself that it's worth the sacrifice to have good grades and be able to focus, but I  now that I am older I am more aware of how it effects me. My grades immediately went from C's to high B's and the Highest gpa I've had in years. I quit taking it when I realized that it was destroying my life in the following ways:
-Extreme OCD behavior
-Depression
-AntiSocial behavior
-Muscular twitches
-Dependence
-Most of all, Loss of identity

Naturally I am a outgoing person, I love people, I'm easy going, and always have a smile on my face but Adderall flipped my world upside down. I would not recommend any parent putting their child on this medication under any circumstance, if you care about them at all. ADD is not a disorder, it is just a way to classify people who function on a higher/different level than the average population. ADD is a gift that our society hasn't learned how to handle. 
My recommendation to parents would be to look for and encourage the abilities and gifts your child has, and be as supportive as you possibly can. They need to know that they are brilliant, creative, and gifted. The reason ADD'ers can't focus well is because they are constantly thinking! What kind of world do we live in when thinking needs to be medicated?!"

It seemed to help at first, I was concentrating better, keeping up with tasks, and getting more things done. However, I'm also being treated for depression, and after only a few weeks I started noticing the symptoms of my depression coming back. After a full month on the drug, I was extremely irritable, overreacting to stress, crying at every little thing, snapping at friends and family... I really damaged a relationship with one friend, sadly. Upon talking to my doctor, I found out that Adderall can cause heightened emotions, which is exactly what I was trying to treat with the depression medication! She offered to put me on a mood stabilizer drug as well, but I said just take me off the Adderall and try something else for the ADD rather than adding another drug to fix its side effects. I'm trying Strattera now, we'll see how it works. The drug did what it was supposed to do, but honestly, my ADD isn't bad enough to warrant taking a drug with this kind of side effect.

2180$Condition: Other$4/28/2008 1:39:04 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$5$I first saw a doctor when I was 17 yrs. old seeking treatment for depression and constant lethargy. However, after answering a short questionnaire, I was diagnosed with ADD, and have been on Adderall (which was helpful at first) ever since. Now, I've been on the medication so long that I can't remember who, or how I was before I started taking it. In addition to causing my mild OCD to become full blown routine-altering OCD, I find that the medication increases my irritability 10 fold (especially when it's wearing off, and especially within the last year). I'm not sure if it is the medication or simply life circumstances that is now causing me severe depression, extreme lack of motivation, and weird and very sudden mood swings. I have also experienced more common side effects, like jaw clenching, tension, dizziness, and increased heart rate. I would like to try to stop taking the medication now, but feel I am dependent on it and am afraid of the withdrawal effects. I worry about the long term side effects that I may experience from taking this drug for so long, and the misery that it may/may not be causing me presently. I would NEVER consider putting a child on this medication.

My ability to think ahead, anticipate and avoid problems has dramatically improved. My abilty to articulate myself improves dramatically on adderal â especially with a low dose.  I can understand the consequences of my actions with a clarity that I wish I had earlier in life J My over-all attention span has dramatically improved in the last five years â and it remains significantly higher even on days when I choose not to take adderall. To me, that is amazing. Tasks I once found painful, I can now do quickly an efficiently with patience and perfect detail â even off adderall. A large part of why I think I see a lot of improvement is not just the medication, but also all the other things I do to combat ADHD.

When I need to learn something new (e.g. a software program at work) adderal helps me quickly learn and absorb the new information, and remember facts. It is a dramatic change from my past abilities.

When I first started taking the drug, I had heart palpitations. It is definitely hard on the heart. BUT then I started to add regular, gentle but rigorous aerobic exercise to my routine (which, btw, is a non-prescription treatment for ADHD), my heart became stronger, more conditioned than before and the palpitations stopped. My resting hr is 45 bpm, and my blood pressure is ideal, or close to it. This also will solve any insomnia problems.

I recommend this drug â FOR THE RIGHT PERSON. Fact is we are all built differently. Which is the whole reason why drugs like this are made in the first place. Depending on your peculiarities, it may not give you exactly what you need.  That doesnât mean this drug wonât be very helpful to someone else. I look forward to the day when these types of drugs can be prescribed and monitored more accurately. "

In a nutshell - it significantly reduced my level of perceived anxiety. I didn't realize it, but I was probably living with a ""4"" on a 1 - 10 scale for general anxiety.  Adderall brought me down to a 1 or 2.  I think that basically after a month or two my adrenaline and other things were basically either all used up, or the receptor sites were burned out.  Basically there was no ""fire"" because all of the fuel had been burned up.  Also, I think that I had some mild depression creeping in - I became somewhat unmotivated, and really didn't want to do much physically.

After about 1 year my libido dropped like a rock, my testicles felt as if they had shrunken to 1/2 their normal size.  My body temperature was always low - it was routinely in the mid 96 to low 97 range.  I had no physical strength nor endurance - where I had been previously in good shape and could crank out 25 pushups at any given time, I could only manage 20 or so ""girl"" pushups (supported by knees) after which time I was exhausted.  After working out, I didn't feel as if I was gaining any benefit or very minor benefit, almost as if I was having a muted recovery.  

After initially becoming more organized I began slipping back, then I was maybe only 25% of my initial organization. 

I have stopped taking XR on a daily basis and have begun taking it only ""as needed"" - what my doctor doesn't know will not hurt him.  I think that something needs to be recharged - I am now an advocate of ""drug holidays"", every other day usage, or simply ""as needed"" be that at work, or home. 

I never found myself feeling mentally addicted - but I did have brain fog for a couple of days when stepping down.

I was on 30mg/day Adderall XR - 40yo male - ~18 months.

You would have never known I had an attention problem because I was a very active teenager.  I was involved in sports, many extracuricular activities and worked since I was 16 so my mind was constantly focused on something different.  It became a problem after becoming a single mom.  I couldn't organize any thought.  If there was too much going on I couldn't focus to organize it.  I didn't pay bills, I took extreme chances, and even forgot I was a mom sometimes.  After finally confessing to my mother how i felt she suggested talking to my PCP.  He gave me the 20mg XR 6 months ago and now I feel as though I am actually living my life.  I have since fixed my finances, gotten promoted at work, and enjoy my time with my daughter so much more.  I would suggest this treament to anyone as long as their Dr. agrees.  Use caution when taking this it can be very addicting, and should not for children that have no gone through puberty.  i have lost 30 pounds since start because of the lack of appetite and amount of exercise i do.  I also have about two nights a week that i have trouble falling asleep.  over all I thank myself every day for being able to communicate how I felt.  I am finally the person I always wanted to be and never thought could be.

I set the alarm for an hour before I need to be up and when the alarm goes off, I wake up just long enough to swallow the pill with a bunch of water then I go back to sleep. Without fail, I wake up almost exactly an hour later feeling awake and energetic. The energy continues throughout the day and wears off in time for me to fall asleep easily. Until the early evening I have very little appetite but if I decide I have to eat, it's not difficult and generally my appetite returns a bit once i start eating. I feel totally able to pay attention to my work, writing papers, reading textbooks, focusing in lectures which was impossible before Adderall or when I miss a dose. I took Ritalin for several months before switching to Adderall with no effect at all.

I would sit for hours preforming illogical tasks that I couldn't stop; like combing my hair for 6 hours.  My eyes were dialated, I ached from being tense, and I also felt disconnected from the world.  I was very irritable, paranoid, dizzy, sweating, short of breath, and OCD.  I couldn't fall asleep without prescription medications.  I was too anxious to even take the trash out.  I will never take stimulants of this kind again.  Afterall, I know I am bipolor, but the thought of removing that diagnosis gained enough of my trust to try stimulants.  I've never felt more crazy!

I talked to my doctor about it after I got an office job. I too am one of those people that can read every word in a paragraph and have no idea what it said because my mind was elsewhere. I couldn't listen to a solid sentence someone was saying to me for the same reason. After taking adderall I worked so much more efficiently and understood a lot more. It was as if my head was pulled out of a cloud or something. I really wish I had been more aware of this condition in high school. I was always a decent student making average grades but it was very difficult for me to really understand and grasp things, especially in math. I had a very appathetic attitude towards high school and my efforts to go to college were lacking...and as a result of that I still haven't gone back to school. Knowing how much better I could have done in high school if I had been prescribed to it then really makes me wonder how much more I could have accomplished as far as scholarships and things of that nature. Overall, taken responsibly adderall has been 100% effective. The biggest side effect I'v experienced has been a lack of hunger. I've lost probably 20 pounds in the last 8 months. I just make sure I eat before I take it and drink nutritional shakes throughout the day.

However this dug is very habit forming and I do not recomend children taking this medication at all. If you have to use this medication use as directed and have someone monitor you while taking, very easy to abuse. I took myself of the medication cause I noticed I was abusing it. The withdrawls off this medication are horrible and I don't recommend stoping this medication suddenly, it hurts. I felt like those people you see on T.V. coming off heroin.
2217$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$1/31/2008 4:36:55 PM$Reviewer: addledinindiana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$3$"Adult ADDer diagnosed at 5 yrs 'hyperkinetic:' prescr barbituates. At 9, diff doc prescr Dexedrine: huge improvement. Family moved: no dr, no meds. 'til school insisted I be treated. New doc prescr Dexedrine. Life again improved significantly. Another family move: no meds, no dr.  Impulse took hold: I ran away & got married. New OB/GYN precr Obetrol (Adderall) & amphetamine for ADHD/extreme impulsivity. I felt normal again. First son was a Rit kid, diagnosed ADHD at 5 years. 
As an adult, my hyperactivity DECREASED, while other ADD symptoms INCREASED: inattentiveness, distractions, severe impulsivity, reckless behavior. I tried all the ADHD meds and methyphenidates do not work for me. On Dex Spansules & tabs 'til the '90s. Thanks to Dex, I finished HS/college and attained a career (which didn't last). 
In '92, p-doc took me from ADD meds to HIGH doses of SSRIs. Spun out-of-control for over a decade.  
Moved to IN in '02. After a couple of incidents resulting from my ADD I stopped SSRIs. Dr refused to prescr ADD meds & said she didn't ""believe"" in ADHD. She wrote Provigil for ""focus"" and a CPAP machine for sleep disorder, neither did 'squat.' Hit rock-bottom 3 months ago & found a NP who prescribed Adderall XR 20 mg. It helped a TINY BIT. At my pleading, she raised XR to 30mg & added a 10 mg d-amp tab to be broken in half, 5 mg in AM with XR, 5 mg early to mid PM.
Her concern is my age. Phys health is GOOD: no heart, liver, kidney, lung problems. Low BP all my life. Never smoked, rarely drink maybe glass of wine once a month. XR is slow-starting, so mornings are shot before I know it, then have severe sleepy period in mid-aft. XR kicks in again around 5PM but then I hyperfocus on all the wrong things until 10-11PM, when I binge & fidget until I go to sleep with xanax around 1AM.
Here is my personal dx: I'm under-dosed. On Adderall XR, a minimum 60mg x 2 plus 10mg D-amp x 2.
Preference is Dex Spans + 5mg Dex tabs x 3.
XR's inconsistent & a rollercoaster ride."

I was not diagnosed with ADD/ADHD until the start of my treatment.  With this treatment I have noted some very distinct changes in my performance in college and now in my career.  I am a Mechanical Engineer in NC.  My focus at work seems to be increased but not over the top.  I finally feel that I can start a project and follow it through to the end.  Finishing the minute details that have plagued me in the past and that I have procrastinated with in the past.  I feel that Adderall oral is an effective treatment for my condition.  Although I strongly urge parents and students to take caution with using this treatment option.  I have noticed a weekly to bi-weekly occurrence of limited sleep for one to two nights.  This seems to typically happen on a Friday night and Sunday nights.  As this has continued I feel that there are some other treatments that I should attempt before settling on this one.  Also as I was diagnosed during my final semester of college with ADD/ADHD I noticed that I suddenly had more friends then the prior 5 years of college.  So parents, students in college with go to extreme measures to acquire Adderall from your child. This is also becoming an increasing concern for college campuses across the nation.  Like I said before, I believe, this medication should be taken consistently and you shouldn't miss many treatments.  Missing treatments has made me extremely groggy and lazy.  So caution to not taking it on the weekends.  I have noticed that when I continued treatment for 7 days a week I didn't have the haze, groggy and lazy feeling.  Also I reduce my dosage to half during the weekends. I hope this helps all in some manner.

My doctor originally started me off with a drug that is almost exactly Ritalin. I started with it in freshman year due to my lowly grades and noticeable problems. I started using the ritalin like drug, but saw no satisfying results. It also seemed to be correlated with having sleeping problems, appetite loss, and depression. So i stopped using it. When i went to my doctor and told him about  it he seemed to realize that the ritalin wasn't causing the stress and other problems, but it was just the the troubles of freshman year. The drug and my problems weren't actually connected. My doctor prescribed adderall for me in my sophomore year, and i almost instantaneously saw the improvements, faster reaction time, less daydreaming, and i could keep my grades up and remember my work with ease. Luckily i had parents that trusted me enough to let me keep the medication in my own place(in my room) because i was ashamed at first to have to take something to make myself better. It was as if it kind of lifted a disability completely off of my shoulders. Ive taken it all the way through college and stopped when i graduated, i experienced no real withdrawal, I just had to make a smooth transition which my doctor helped me with greatly. If taken in the right doses and not obsessed about it seems to be a very good help for my future and self esteem.
Just realize that what you see as depression and other related things could very well be the much more stressful and much more dangerous thing called high school."

I've taken adderall when i was in high school and then went off the medication for about a year. During that year my grades went from A's and B's to C's or below. Its not that i wasn't a hard worker, i just couldn't concentrate on school work. Its a great medicine and works if used correctly. There are a few complications with it if you take 40 mg or higher for a long period of time (i.e-years) i have read that there is a possiblity of heart complications. But if you stay at a healthy dose and don't go overboard..it works. Also, adderall XR is great b/c you only have to take it once a day, instead of twice a day.

Though adderall is not a ""silver bullet"" it greatly helped me reach my potential as a college student. In high school I went undiagnosed and subsequently untreated which resulted in my sub par grades. It wasnt until college when I talked to my pyschiatrist who throughly evaluated me and first tried me on Ritalin which made me extremely tired, then finally Adderall. Adderall and therapy have allowed me to stay focused and acheive more than I ever dreamed possible. I'm now on the deans list with a 4.0 in my senior year of college. I was also really lucky to not really have any side effects or withdrawl symptoms, although if I take it too late in the day I have a hard time falling asleep, but thats to be expected from an amphetimine.

As a college student, I thought it was normal to be unable to focus on my professors in class or to have trouble finishing my papers or reading homework assignments.  I would often become so obsessed with the details of a project I would not be able to finish and become discouraged. Adderall keeps me focused in class and helps me get my homework done in a timely matter. Now I don't procrastinate because I am confident that I will be able to perform successfully.

Nonetheless, - perhaps 50%+ of the time Adderall has been quite helpful in getting me in focus and on track.That is a great benefit because I find myself restlessly pacing much of the time and unable to initiate or complete projects, Often I have felt too defeated to even hoppe to begin a project. I have lived with thisa painful condition for 20 years or more. 
When I do dfocus i can becaome very effective and creative. It has been a strained interior battle to find ways to establish a balance and a rhythm in daily life.
I also take the antidepressant Cymbalta and often I also need to take Artivan.
So, it is a frustrating story. Adderall is a great help when it helps, and yet i worry about dependence and also the apparent habituation.
All medications for mood and behavior seem to offer complicated trade-offs requiring frequent self-evaluation and consultation with doctors and also with friends and family. Often I feel embarrassed that I seem to need these types of medicines, and yet is  clear that for me they are helpful and also 
problematic."

I've tried 10mg/day in 2 doses and also 10mg/day in 1 XR (extended release) dose.  It has been incredibly helpful.  I get more done in 1 day than I used to in a week or more.  My husband doesn't come home to find me in the middle of 10 unfinished ""projects"".  The 2 major downsides for me are the addictiveness and the loss of appetite.  I am a mess if I don't take it, and I am naturally a very small person to begin with, so the loss of appetite can be a pretty serious problem.  Eating & maintaining a reasonable weight is a daily struggle, but at least now I can keep up with my responsibilities enough that I even have time to eat!"

My symptoms did not include hyperactivity but rather the ability to stay focused on anything detailed for any length of time. 

Ex: Im an Internet Sales Manager at a car dealership. At the start of this career 2.5 years ago, I did not have the energy, patience, attention span to learn the intricates of computers/websites/email programs. Since, I rose to the top of my industry to level of Consulting dealerships on how to sell more cars from the internet.

2282$Condition: Other$11/27/2007 6:05:57 PM$Reviewer: $4$3$5$The main problem with Adderall is that it is extremely addictive. I started taking it to help me get through classes and work. I loved that it killed my appetite. I thought I'd be able to take it in moderation, but I take it everyday now. I just feel like a happier person when I take it. But I've noticed that I am distant and easily annoyed if I take too much. Sometimes I feel that I'm on the verge of having a panic attack. If I take 15 MG a day and I eat I feel amazing. But its very easy to avoid eating and take 30 MG because you just get so much done. Im very nervous that I will become strongly addicted to the drug. Im also nervous that I will loose too much weight. Scary.

My thought process is much more organized and my ability to stay focused on a conversation and tuned into the subject at hand has improved immensely.  I have over the years tried to slow and constrain my hyperactivity with lorasapam and other sedatives with only a moderate amount of success; major side effect was drossiness and fatigue. I looked into the possibilities of Adderall after speaking with a coworker who was prescribed Adderall several years ago and how he was able to continue his education due to his ability effectively concentrate.  After reading more about the symptoms associated with ADD it seemed to be a perfect match to my condition. This medication has reduced much of my public speaking inhibition; I find that I am more out going, in control, less critical of my self, and more inclined to participate in meeting and activities with minimum anxiety. My sexual drive is actually more enhanced. I am taking 5mg three times daily, but am still adjusting the dosage to alleviate side effects (inability to fall asleep at night) and achieve the maximum benefit. This has been an extremely positive life changing treatment for ADD.

I am the typical ADD patient. My mind was racing in a hundred directions at once so I wasn't able to focus on anything. Addy helps me slow down and focus my brain enough to acutally complete the tasks I need to and to do it efficiently. Of course, in the beginning, I got a few side effects - dry mouth, appetite loss, diarrhea (dont take with coffee - TRUST ME), and some insomnia. I also found myself craving cigarettes for some odd reason. I found that if I ate a meal before taking it in the morning that it almost eliminated most of them. After a few months your body will get used to it. I DO recommend that if you don't need it on the weekends that you don't take it. That way, your body won't be as likely to get addicted to it. I've been taking it for 4 years and I LOVE IT.

After finding out my older brother had ADHD I started looking into it. What I found was I was a dead on case. So it's been 2 weeks on Adderal and it has made my life easier on every level. Keep in mind it is a stimulant so follow the dose and be true to yourself and talk with your doctor about your reactions on the drug.  Sleep and appetite our at times and issue, but remember to eat frequently and don't take adderall near bed-time. The positives far out weigh anything else. You can actually go thru life and take things as they come.  It doesn't have to feel like you against the world when facing tasks, challenges etc.  A+ for this...

With others I lost weight and felt sickly 24/7 (sick to my stomach, weak, lightheaded, dry mouth, just generally terrible). I started taking Adderall, initially in a VERY small dose and I noticed significant improvement. My doctor and I played with the dosage and I'm so happy with the result. The ONLY set back is feeling jittery every now and again. The best solution for that is just to make sure you're eating an appropriate amount. Not tons, but just spread out small meals and snacks and this won't pose a problem. Eating this way is way more healthy anyways. So now I can focus and feel very optimistic about getting things done everyday instead of dreading everything and having no energy, will or attention to finish things (school work). Great drug. I was very nervous to start taking it because I normally refuse all medicine... but this REALLY helped. Just be careful with dosage and eating.

Each time this happens, we have huge and dangerous fights, often started over some minor incident.

It works well for me, although it took a long time to find the correct doseage-10mg, but I could NEVER imagine giving this to a child. I am on a low dose and I really feel side effects. Such as tenseness, irratation, lightheadedness, and I just am not myself when I take it. Although the drug does work, I would only recommend it for adults that know their bodies well and know how and when it works for them. It does have sexual side effects as well. For those looking for something for a child, look for something other than these meds, they are NOT for children!

There are no roller coaster ups and downs that I had with Adderall, a much smoother transition. The results/effect seem to last longer without the hyper-focus of Adderall.
I was on Adderall and my VA doctor took me off it completely and said I didn't need it. I was getting in trouble at work for lack of attention to detail, forgetting to pay bills, etc. I went to another doctor, she suggested I try Evekeo. The pharmacy through a communication error and had me on just one 10mg pill a day instead of three, for 3 weeks. I had a follow up was put on three 10mg pills a day(2 @ 8a, 1 @ 1p), and allowed to play around with times taken and could go up to 4 a day. It was a completely experience from Adderall or the 10 mg Evekeo. Adderall was more like a light switch being flipped on then off as the medication wore off. Evekeo was a lot smoother, I never really feel it kick in or turn off, it is just kind of there. It is more like being more effective, less effective. Even when the medication should have worn off, I don't feel as scattered or spacey. With Adderall I would often get these episodes of hyper-focus where I had a hard time switching tasks. So far with Evekeo I have never had those episodes. I work retail, and I am constantly changing focus from customers to task and back. I currently take three 10mg a day but the doctor wrote the script for 105. On longer days where I am up at 7a have to be to work at 1p and work until 9p. If I have taken one pill around 1 or 2p I can feel myself becoming less focused around 6-7p. If I take 2 around 1-2p it will last until around 8:30-9p, which is perfect. I also found that I can't take it later than 3p, I can't get to sleep before midnight-1a. Taking the last pill no later than 1:30p, I can get to sleep by 11p."

Where do I begin, evekeo makes me jittery, anxious, and feel just plain weird. I know what amphetamines should feel like, when I heard 50% levo I pretty much knew what to expect but figured what the heck, its only for a month.  

After having been on Dexedrine and adderall for the past 3 years, and now Evekeo. I can fairly say that the levo side of amphetamines is not only inferior it also has far more side effects. This is somewhat of a known fact in the medical community. Amphetamines are either dexdro or levo or some of both. Dexdro tends to be more cerebral and calming while levo tends to be more physical and distruptive, by distruptive I mean your heart will let you know pretty quickly. 

Dexedrine is 100% of the dexdro side of amphetamines, Adderall is 75/25, and Evekeo is 50/50. I know that everyone's treatment is personal, so I'll speak for myself as only I can. Dexedrine is by far the superior product, Adderall comes in second because it only has 25% levo.

Evekeo lags behind with its whopping 50% of levo induced jitters, palpitations and tweakiness. When my doc told my they have something new thats 50/50, I was like, you mean benzedrine, yah thats not new. Kinda like when he tried to tout zenzedi as the new cool kid on the block, I was like you mean rebranded dexadrine. I'll take my generic thanks.  I had my doubts about evekeo but wanted to give it a fair shot. Having had dexedrine before I know that there's way better treatment out there. "

Unlike adderall, this medication is very mild compared to adderall and the feeling of being wired. This medication lasts longer and more steady than adderall XR and the peak is much longer than Adderall IR. Compared to Vyvanse, this medication has more of a steady in my system mildly vs Vyvanse being strong then wears off fast throughout the course of 12 hours. 

I wish they made this medication in higher doses than 5 and 10mg. It's the same thing as adderall except adderall is 75% Dextroamphetamine and 25% Levoamphetamine. This medication is freebase amphetamine sulfate so it's 50% Dextro/Levo. So a 10mg isn't much different than taking a 10mg adderall. It just releases it differently and freebase form is probably more potent than the salts. "

Please use caution with this medication. As soon as I started taking Evekeo I became suicidal, apathetic, very irritable, and it really did not seem to do much for my ADD. My sister said I turned into a completely different person.

I am sure it works wonderfully for others but it took me by surprise! This was the first kind of serious reaction I had to ADD medication -- so your first day or two trying Evekeo make sure you have loved ones around to keep an eye on you."

Evekeo for me was great because it was 60 pills for free.  I take it as needed, but basically once a day.  Compared to other meds I've taken, this one gives me focus without waiting for twho hours to kick in just to have a crash later in the day.

To me, the best part of this new med is that I know it's working cuz I'm focused, getting thigs done, but I can sleep and I have no irritability.  knowing so many friends on these types of meds, I'm certain some patients are going to not like anything.  because of that, I'm glad new ones keep coming.

I switched over to Evekeo two months ago instead of upping my Vyvanse from 60mg to 70mg. It's effective in that it works in helping to maintain focus and it takes effect quickly. My primary problem is the mood it puts me in. I'm finding myself constantly irritable, stressed, and ready to lash out over, retrospectively, small annoyances. This is especially problematic on days where I leave my afternoon pill (it's a twice a day medication) at home. Two days ago, I was very surprised to find myself in a good mood with a generally positive outlook. Then I realized that I had not forgotten to take Evekeo that day. I'm dropping Evekeo with my next prescription and going back to Vyvanse. That being said, your experience might be different. There's a free month discount available, so it might be worth trying, but know that you might have to do some legwork to locate a pharmacy that carries it.

I've been on various stimulants for close to 7 years: Adderall 10mg, 30mg, dexedrine 5mg and 10mg, desoxyn 5mg, Concerta 54mg, Vyvanse 70mg (currently still on this), and of course the generics of those listed that exist.  I would say Evekeo is closest to Desoxyn in terms of how it effects me.  Fast onset, short acting, no jitters or hyper-vigilance, no 'staring at all the nothing', appetite of course is suppressed so stay hydrated on this stuff.

I had a ""free"" coupon that turned out, thanks to fine print, to cost a 30 dollar co-pay.  Apparently it's quite expensive without it, so I will be going back to Dexedrine 5mg once this two month supply is up.  

I cannot say it has the euphoria Desoxyn can provide when taken in higher doses, but where it differs from everything I listed above, it works wonders for getting out of bed.  Vyvanse takes up to an hour to kick in, and Desoxyn/Dexedrine/Adderall was simply not strong enough or not the right 'type' of stimulant to actually propel me out of bed.  That said, I work 12 hour days so when it comes to taking it when Vyvanse wears off it's subtle but has a nice peak that makes my 1.5 hour commute far safer, and it wears off just a few hours after I get home.

If the cost wasn't so ridiculous I'd go for this stuff, but big pharma can stuff it because consumers are forced to use generics unless they are stupid, rich, or both.  Still, probably the best IR stim out there."

2373$Condition: Other$3/25/2015 12:12:51 PM$Reviewer:  on Treatment for less than 1 month$5$4$5$Been on it for two days and it works fast. Almost too fast. It doesn't last very long only about four hours at most. Best if taken twice a day, Unlike the Adderall XR, but close to Dexedrine it the management of ADHD. I feel like I can slow down and get my thoughts under control. Also when taken right It doesn't effect sleep. In fact over the last two days I think it helps with getting into a sleep wake pattern.
